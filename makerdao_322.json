                    "content": "SES is excited to announce that Chaos Labs, a cloud security and testing platform for smart contract applications, has recently joined the SES incubation program to form a Core Unit focused on testing infrastructure. Chaos Labs is building an agent- and scenario-based simulation platform that will increase the robustness of the MakerDAO testing stack. The long-term ambition of Chaos Labs is to:  Own Maker Testing and Security Infrastructure - build Maker-specific tools to help developers build secure and well-tested software. Improve the overall quality of software being developed in the Maker ecosystem. Make it easier for engineers to get up and running with a dev environment, thus improving the openness of the Maker developer ecosystem.  During its time in the SES incubation program, Chaos Labs has interviewed stakeholder engineering teams in MakerDAO to understand the pain points of existing testing infrastructure and development tooling. Based on these interviews Chaos Labs proposes a proof-of-concept testing solution for MakerDAO.  Read the full announcement, research and the proposed proof of concept here.  Watch the Chaos Labs introduction video on the SES status update call. Please feel free to use this forum thread for discussion, questions or comments. ",

I think the most helpful way for this to work is for the \u201cRun\u201d button to actually generate a set of scripts that will produce the desired simulation. This seems like the way to go because  Seeing the source code to produce the simulation has some educational value Developers may want to customize the simulation or replace one piece of it  ",

Excited to finish this dev sprint and be able to share it with the community soon  ",
