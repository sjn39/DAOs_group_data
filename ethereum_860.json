I, unfortunately, missed the council of Prague due to timing incompatibility and I think the risk is even greater for Osaka. Travelling to Japan is really expensive, both for transportation and accommodation. We are starting to book hotels and flights, and I\u2019m sure we are not the only one. It would be a shame if potential participants realize afterwards that their travel dates don\u2019t allow them to attend this fall\u2019s council. So my question is, has the organisation started? If not what is the process to initiate that? Finding a venue is important but I believe deciding on a date even more so. ",

Many orgs want to have their meetings at Devcon venue and I am afraid the scenario that they run out of space after we decide to ditch the space we already booked a month ahead. Also I am afraid that the Devcon venue will be noisy as they are prepping for the event. Having said that, our venue is right next to the Devcon venue so you could participate part of it (probably 10 min walk if you don\u2019t get lost). We are currently planning to have unconf style just like Magicians, but if you can coordinate with other ENS workshop participants to propose a certain topic (I assume you want to talk about inter wallet standard such as ENS login), then I can propose ENS team to secure the discussion time of the specific topic at pre-determined time. (NOTE this proposal depends on our venue capacity. If we are over capacity, we prioritise people who can commit to our event for the whole day). ",

Date:  Tuesday October 8th, 2019, from 9am-5pm Location:  \u201cWhere most of us will probably be on Day 1 of Devcon 5\u201d Major Themes:  Ethereum in the Enterprise, Ethereum 1, Ethereum 2 The community has use of a large space at (or near) Devcon itself. I still can\u2019t fully specify, LOL. With this space, we can facilitate some very interesting discussions about the protocol and development roadmaps. Note that we cannot call it a Council if it is at an event with a high ticket price, but we can still organize something great. We will need help to physically prepare the space and coordinate with the Devcon team, and of course the venue management. We need to be able to communicate what we need for facilitating discussions. This is where @nrryuya, @moontysal, and @wildmolasses can really help us. This is a layout I would like to have, but we may need to settle for something more conventional.  image.png1376\u00d7936 34.6 KB  ",
