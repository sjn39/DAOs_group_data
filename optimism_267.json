                    "content": "This is the GF Phase 1 Proposal from the Overnight.fi Protocol. The goal is to help push the adoption of Overnight.fi innovative product line (yield generating stablecoin USD+ and delta-neutral ETS strategies) on the Optimism network. Project name: Overnight.fi Author name and contact info: Maxim Ermilov @wmermus, can be contacted through Telegram I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes L2 recipient address: 0xe497285e466227F4E8648209E34B465dAA1F90a0 Grant category: Governance Fund Phase 1 Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee? [y/n, link to committee] Yes, DeFi Committee Project description (please explain how your project works): Overnight.fi is the company behind stablecoin USD+. USD+ is USDC that pays you yield via daily rebase. It is 100% collaterized with high-quality stables (USDC, BUSD, USDT, DAI etc.) that are invested onchain into lowest risk no IL stable-to-stable strategies. The yield from farming is passed over to USD+ holders via rebase. The superpower of USD+ is its ability to pay yield in liquidity pools, thus maximizing capital efficiency of LP provision. Core usecases:  Treasury management Liquidity provision on Dexes (e.g. currently USDC/USD+ on Velodrome) Maximizing yield on projects\u2019 own liquidity on DEXes (e.g. Sphere, OtterClam, Tetu, Parrotly, MDB etc paired against USD+ to receive yield from liquidity they maintain at DEXes)  In addition to USD+, Overnight is offering ETS (\u201cexchange traded strategies\u201d product line). ETS is a quasi-stable (some call it \u2018delta-neutral\u2019 strategy packaged inside a rebase token) that accepts USD+, uses it as collateral to borrow (hedge) a crypto asset on AAVE (or Granary), then farms crypto-to-stable pool. Currently, on OP there is already ETS ETH/USDC via Velodrome/AAVE and ETS OP/USDC via Velodrome/Granary in process of release. Overnight intends to make Optimism its \u2018innovation hub\u2019, i.e. the chain where all new products/approaches are developed, tried and launched ahead of other chains. The pipeline includes:  \u2018Self-bribing\u2019 LP on Velodrome: USD+ yield from Velodrome LP pools automatically directed towards bribes on Velo Insurance: Users will be able to exchange risky asset, e.g. a Velodrome LP of two risky stables, for a combination of insured and uninsured tokens (tranches), with insured - redeemable for USD+ and uninsured - for OVN, Overnight\u2019s governance token yet to be released -Additional \u2018+\u2019 products: DAI+, Eur+ (once agEur available on Aave), but also experimenting with BTC+ and a few others Additional ETS, in particular, OP-to-stable ETSes as OP borrowing limits increase on Granary and appear on Aave  Project links:  Website: Overnight.fi   Twitter: Overnight_fi  Discord Community: Discord   Additional team member info (please link): Telegram: @wmermus LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxim-ermilov/ Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: N/A Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): Overnight went into open beta around May 1st, 2022 and, despite the timing coinciding with the UST crash, has been having great momentum, largely helped by increased risk aversion:  TVL has exceeded 5.5 M USD, x11 growth since UST crash in May (USD+ finalized closed beta and launched open beta on May 1st) number of users has exceeded 2,8K, i.e. x6 growth since May USD+ daily trading volumes have fluctuated in the range of 0.5-1M per day depending on market volatility, on average exceeding 14.5% of TVL, putting USD+ b/w BUSD and USDC on this metric, far ahead of most CDP stablecoins  The growth has been driven by:  Partnerships with Dexes, in particular, Dystopia/Penrose and Cone/Unknown, Velodrome Partnerships with other projects that chose to establish trading pairs with USD+: Lido (stMatic), Sphere, Tetu, OtterClam, MDB, Parrotly Finance etc. Launch of highly attractive (and profitable) product - ETS, a quasi-stable high-yield strategy product on top of USD+/wMatic and USD+/wBNB pools (with hedged crypto price-risk) Expansion to BSC and Optimism chains  Overnight entered Optimism about 2.5 weeks ago with the launch of USDC/USD+ pool on Velodrome. Since then TVL has exceeded 1.5M with 133 users. Total \u2018bribing\u2019 amount has been just 7K USD+, of which 4K from came from \u2018self-bribing\u2019 described above. Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes, however, we intend the keep portfolio rebalancing algorithms behind ETS closed until at least public sale of OVN governance token Optimism native?: Overnight looks to make OP its innovation hub, i.e. develop all its new innovative products and approaches first on OP, then deploy most successful ones to other chains. It is not our first chain, but will become native to most of our innovation Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Technical deployment - August 2022, commercial launch - first week of September 2022 Ecosystem Value Proposition:   What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? Building ideal DeFi product suite for crypto-winter and beyond: trustworthy, low-risk, decentralised asset management solution for passive stablecoin investors with minimum risk appetite in a convenient \u2018stablecoin\u2019 form factor   How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? Overnight\u2019s vision is to build \u2018Vanguard of DeFi\u2019 with (1) USD+ as a lowest risk product (equivalent of traditional money-market funds) and (2) ETF as a medium risk product (equivalent of ETF). Insurance product being built will play the central role in de-risking Overnight\u2019s ecosystem of the structural DeFi risks   Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? Overnight is targeting risk-averse segment of DeFI (both individuals and treasuries), somewhat underserved segment, which, we believe, over time will overtake \u2018degen\u2019 segment of DeFI in volumes and revenue. Over time risk-consious investing always wins. This will be even more pronounced through crypto-winter   Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? Yes Number of OP tokens requested: 400,000 OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: NA How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): USD+ will match 100% of the liquidity mining incentives by (1) channelling USD+ yield from liquidity pools with USD+ on Velodrome and Balancer to self-bribing and (2) allocating 50K USD worth of BAL received from Balancer for building boosted pool with USD+ on an L2 towards Beethoven\u2019s USDC/DAI boosted pool. Proposal for token distribution:   How will the OP tokens be distributed? 50% for Overnight products liquidity mining on Optimism (spread between Velodrome and Balancer). \u2192 This would grow USD+ and ETS liquidity on Optimism, but also increase liquidity for the protocols and pairs USD+ and ETS collateral is invested into (100% is invested on the same chain) 25% for expansion of \"+\"and ETS product lines: ETS based on OP/USDC in particular, as well as DAI+, potentially, BTC+ and/or Eur+ etc. \u2192 This would attract users with corresponding risk appetite 25% for building insurance product \u2192 This would derisk entire Overnight ecosystem: both USD+ and ETS  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? 3-6 months  Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. First KPI will be exceeding 10M in TVL and 2000 users for Overnight overall Second KPI - exceeding 1M in TVL and 100 users for ETS products Third KPI - the launch of Insurance  Stablecoins like USD+ have considerable network effects. By reaching critical mass of TVL and users, powered by low risk, USD+ and Overnight will realize network effects and make Overnight sustainable on Optimism   Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? Our overall approach is that Overnight products should be attractive without rewards (with rewards used essentially for promotion/marketing only):   USD+ relies on natural yield on the chain to generate yield for its users USD+ model we are deploying on Optimisme is \u2018self-bribing\u2019, i.e. natural yield from USD+ in Velodrome and Beets core pools will be support bribes beyond incentives ETS also has a \u2018natural source of yield\u2019; we will use part of the funds allocated to developing ETS product line on Optimism, towards developing ETS based on Uni-V3 non-incentivized pools, ultimately sustainable source of natural yield  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) All Overnight smart contract addresses on Optimism can be found here: Contract Addresses - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta))  We hope the Optimism community will help Overnight not just grow TVL, but push DeFI innovation forward and beyond. Optimism is ideal chain for building things that had not been tried before. Let us know if you have any feedback on the proposal! ",

Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on this summary: What Optimism stands to gain:  Liquidity and support for the USD+ stablecoin token Some cross-polination of defi users from your dapps on other chains Verbal promise to use Optimism as a test bed for new features before other chains  What Optimism must give up:  400,000 OP, most of which will be liquidated for other stables behind the scenes for funding and yield rewards  On the face of it, this is a critical comment. I\u2019m still not a fan of mercenary incentives, but it DOES bring users. I\u2019m just not convinced it\u2019s users that anyone actually wants or gets to keep in the long-term. I always prefer incentives that bring in users who are doing something. This does look like a repackaging of existing value \u2013 but you\u2019re hardly alone in that! A money market fund is actually somewhat useful. I would be more receptive to this proposal if USD+ innovated more on the backing / stability side. We really need stablecoin innovators If this were just a safe play to get people into your ecosystem so that you can later convert them into your really exciting product ideas, that would also be more enticing. Could you share some of the experiments you\u2019re considering trying on optimism? Thanks for submitting and deploying on Optimism. Congratulations on the launch. This network is special.

The vision is to build ETS that\u2019s sustainable long term, independent of rewards. That can only be accomplished on Uni V3. We have deployed 4 prototypes on OP and are collecting performance data - contrasting various liquidity mining strategies. So it is not just a promise, but proper R&D. Surely, getting both Gamma and Arrakis very nervous:) What we look to do is to bring from prototype to production the quasi-stable ETS based on UNI-V3, then build insurance for it, then have insured parts of ETS underlie USD+. This way we would arrive to a stablecoin that has sustainable, native source of yield, low-risk and insured. That\u2019s what we have been building on Polygon, but could be much more exciting to accomplish on OP. ",

                    "content": "We just went through the proposal, website, docs, analytics as we didn\u2019t know of Overnight before. Based on the proposal, we assumed your OVN token is already live but we couldn\u2019t find it on Coingecko and your docs show some preOVN token and future IDO with tokenomics under development and missing links (for example to ovnstable.io). According to DeFiLLama & Coingecko the USD+ token has 2.5M marketcap (TVL). According to website & proposal, Overnight offers a USDC wrapper (USD+) & exchange-traded strategies (ETS) that achieve supreme yield from  Stablecoin deposits into lending protocols Stable-to-stable liquidity pools Protocol-owned liquidity  First thoughts:  Appreciate your proposal, deployment to Optimism, first pools on Velo, and consideration of Optimism as your innovation hub. Communication focuses on \u201chigh yield\u201d, \u201cpassive investment\u201d, \u201clow risk investment\u201d as well as big roadmap & ideas. So far, there is little traction (6 &15 users in ETS strategies) though and the product, Op deployment & community look very early stage. The Vanguard approach of simple investing has some merit. Other DeFi projects such as Yaxis also went for this at some point but mainly focused on creating a meta-aggregator of yield strategies. PoL for stablecoin pairs can be a solid yield source (See Alpha Homora). Probability of loss seems small but total value at risk could be all AUM in a pool with one asset moving away from 1 aka going to 0. In our opinion, the USDC wrapper offers little additional value to spur Optimism growth and incentivizing its use at this stage might be a risk to Op users. The ETS product looks interesting but the daily payment if profitable seems strange - would like to see some more traction. Having another stablecoin and potentially more innovative products on Optimism is worth a shot.  Possible improvement:  Ask is very high for size & stage of the project. You can compare it to a recent proposal for 31K OP tokens from Interest Protocol which was approved to speed up deployment on Optimism. A second Interest Protocol proposal over 240K OP for post-deployment is also on the forum but it seems too early to fund at this point in time. We believe an approach with a similar Ask amount to Interest Protocol Proposal 1 might be more suitable at this stage. Potentially also funding from another source in Optimism (or externally) makes more sense to advance development? Token distribution plan should be more detailed & focus on ready products. You can submit a second proposal later-on.  We\u2019d appreciate some insights to learn more about the project & proposal:  Can you explain point 3 in relevant usage metrics? USD+ trading volume? Who is trading it? Why (is it between BUSD & USDC)? What is the current strategy for USD+ to achieve 10% APR. (See overnight.fi) How is risk hedged in ETS Ruby (weth-usdc pool, 14% APY, 2k TVL) or ETH Garnet (USDC-OP, 29% APY, 100K TVL) strategy? How did you come up with the 400,000 OP request? Can you share more about the co-incentives?  ",

I am amswering below in the order of your comments/questions: Overnight is VC funded, we have not issued the OVN token yet as it would limit our VC funding options. We also very much believe that the product should make sense without rewards (which USD+ has demonstrated), then rewards can be used temporarily to promote and scale it. We are graduating from Berkley\u2019s Xcelerator around 2nd of Novemeber and will then take the decision about the OVN-token public sale, which is likely to take place at the end of November. USD+ is not a USDC wrapper, it is a stablecoin that\u2019s 100% collaterized by yield-generating strategies, made of the best quality stables deposited in high-quality protocols (mostly, not lending pools). USD+ magic power is its ability to generate yield in liquidity pools, e.g. inside Velodrome, thus making liquidity mining way more capital efficient. In a traditional pool you get fees and rewards, in a pool with USD+ you get fees, rewards and yield by USD+. USD+ is a rebase token, so we indeed provide a wrapper over USD+ that some people use for tax purposes, and is used by some protocols for integration purposes (e.g. wrapper is used inside Balancer\u2019s boosted pools) ) We need to work better with DeFIama, as the numbers you mention are obviously wrong. The metrics on Optimism alone largely exceed what you mention and as of this morning are: (a) TVL - 4.36M for USD+, 4,47M total (b) Total number of active users - 287 for USD+, 307 total Overall TVL 8.1M, total active users (hard to exclude duplicates) - roughly 3200, discord community 4,06K. It is a little weird that OP is now our largest chain\u2026 what has happened is that once we launched, our power users from Polygon and BNB have moved, in some cases completely, to Optimism - due to much more attractive performance and rates (see below). we have cannibalised at least 3M of our TVL from other chains As far as trading volumes are concerned, in crypto-pairs USD+ is able to achieve same trading volumes as USDC. For example, wMatic/USD+ on polygon generates same trading volume as wMatic/USDC (as % of TVL). This is due to the ease of arbitrage of USD+ to USDC (in case of price discrepancy, an arbitrageur can take a flash loan in USDC, mint USD+, arbitrage wMatic, pay back flashloan;). On polygon we run our own arbitrage bots and generate b/w 10-15% of the volume. The rest is market volume. we look to achieve the same on OP, once ETH/USD+ and OP/USD+ pairs are established On OP we have been generating way more than 10%.

(2) Impermanent loss: we run bots that rebalance the portfolio once there is discrepancy b/w the amount of OP borrowed and OP invested You can see the current positions on ETS OP/USDC below  Screenshot 2022-10-09 at 17.35.511618\u00d7726 121 KB  Please note that we had to limit the maximum on ETS OP/USDC to 100K because of limited liquidity to borrow OP. The cap filled in within 24 hours. Once OP borrowing is available on AAVE, we will eliminate the cap. ETH/USDC is small as it was only announced/launched yesterday; it is designed to yield 15-20% sustainably, but kind made no sense to promote while USD+ itself was yielding 20% average; Overall, ETS is a well-established product for us on other chains, with clear demand and traction 400K OP request is made of 2 parts: (a) Liquidity mining program - based on the incentives we look to generate from our side over the next 6 months (b) Development time required (and honestly, a lot of it already spent) on the deployment and new product development on OP Current level of bribing is 3.5K USD+ (mostly on Velo); this is a sustainable level of bribes, meaning, these are bribes generated by USD+ organically, based on the current size of operation on OP, and they are sufficient to sustain the business. As we expect the business to grow by at least x5 and the yields on OP to go down to more sustainable levels by at least x2, USD+ will be generating about 8K USD+ of bribes per week; we are asking OP to match the bribes we will provide (8K per week) for the next 25 weeks - a total of 200K USD worth of liquidity mining rewards. I understand the other part of the grant, dedicated to the development and R&D work, is hard to evaluate and control. we can discuss if it is valuable to be deployed on OP, adjust the ask or move the development elsewhere. On liquidity mining we are asking to match the bribes we will provide, so hope, that part you will find to be fair. ",

                    "content": "@OPGovWatch We picked Interest protocol as they are also a relatively unproven stable at an early development stage. Overnight differs in being deployed already but similarly lacks meaningful traction & proven durability. In our opinion, TVL is a key metric for an ecosystem to enable traders & other projects but not the north star KPI to look at and not good to single out as a couple of $M USD can quickly move in and out. Ultimately, we all want to focus more on effective liquidity, value-add, sustainable growth. For us, the main differentiator to QiDao is the previous track record & our perceived value-add to Optimism at the time of the proposal. We knew QiDao, their risk management & ecosystem involvement from Polygon. The proposal from QiDao had a large Ask compared to their market cap but the incentive design & distribution, and especially their strong co-incentives lead delegates incl. us to vote yes. (I\u2019d personally expect the same proposal to get at least a 30% haircut today though.) Thank you @_Max_plus for your detailed answer and weighing into each of the mentioned critical points. First of, have to say the communication from the website (focus on profits) and initially rather broad proposal with lack of focus on current products was a big turnoff - almost a red flag. Your reply gives us a much more detailed and positive picture. While still inclined to call it an \u201cUSDC wrapper\u201d or \u201ctop stable wrapper\u201d, and having some doubts about long-term utility of USD+ & success of the products (yields drop, increased smart contract/operational risk vs. holding underlying, etc.), there is value in stables, efficiency & real yield in the current bearish environment - this explains also the uptick in delta-neutral on-chain yield strategies & new stable models. Hence to summarize, the stablecoin/yield generation area is an interesting space, the Overnight products are early stage and might add value but traction & contribution to spur Optimism growth is still unproven & not fully clear. Potentially, a smaller grant than originally proposed but larger than Interest protocol 1 proposal could be \u201cfair\u201d to get going IF good co-incentives are also available & more detail on LM, OP distribution is added. (Note to self: It would be good to have a better overview than this distribution doc over previous grants, their success as well as current projects and their functionalities on Optimism incl. stablecoins, possibilities to lend and borrow Op, etc. to assess new proposals) ",

Maybe i would like wider feedback from the committee, but thats certainly a possibility On co-incentives, as I said: we are already bribing about 3,500 USD+ per week on Velo, we will increase that to 8,000 if our request is approved. within 10 days we will be allocating 50K over 16 weeks in BAL incentives towards launching a USD+/DAI+ boosted pool on Beets.

It was a late submission and the latest discussion & incorporation of feedback seems to lead to some positive changes. Value-Add Overnight is developing the USD+ stablecoin. USD+ is USD that pays you a return through a daily rebase. It is 100% collateralized with other stablecoins (USDC, BUSD, USDT, USDT, DAI, etc.) that are invested on-chain in \u201clow-risk strategies\u201d such as LPing on stables, lending & more. The integration of a yield-generating stable in the Optimism ecosystem can have benefits for Optimism users. Whether Overnight can help with better liquidity & trade efficiency on top stables is still unclear at this point in time. Traction Overnight is an early stage project that intends to make Optimism its \u2018innovation hub\u2019. It has gathered a total TVL of more than $7+ Mio, and since its launch on Optimism in early September there is a clear trend towards Optimism (55% of TVL). The yield strategies have decent APYs but one is capped at 100K (133 users; cap due to liquidity of underlying protocol), and others have attracted only a few 1K$ and users; and strategies will likely not offer 10%+ APYs with larger TVL amounts. With this funding they also want to work on extending their ETS product line (currently 16 users on Op) along other \u201c+\u201d features. Overnight does not have all the contracts public, it has closed open source portfolio rebalancing algorithms behind ETS until at least the public sale of the OVN governance token.

Approx 8K $OP/week for 6 months. 25% for expansion of \u201c\u201d+\"\"and ETS product lines 25% for building insurance product: this would de-risk entire Overnight ecosystem: both USD+ and ETS 200K $OP for LP reward and 200K for product and feature development. Co-incentives Willing to match 100% of liquidity mining incentives along with llocating 50K USD worth of BAL received from Balancer for building boosted pool with USD+ on an L2 towards Beethoven\u2019s USDC/DAI boosted pool. Alignment Overnight is a protocol that is in its early stages. In the future we can evaluate if they are aligned to the Optismim ecosystem. Reccomendation No The protocol has not published its contracts and is in its initial stages. It is in an experimental stage, we are waiting for a bit more maturation, organic traction of the protocol where a better evaluation of product-market-fit can be made before incentivizing growth. The co-incentives are solid, the trend towards building on Optimism and attracting TVL is also positive. Despite that, the positive impact on the Optimism ecosystem is still to be seen, for example whether incentives for Overnight and USD+ would cannibalize organic liquidity on Optimism DEXs and the success of the different yield strategies. We recommend to possibly create two proposals: one for protocol incentives and another for development funding. A focus on the slightly more mature \u201c+\u201d product with a lower Ask, similarly good co-incentives & a clearly detailed LP / bribe distribution plan in a subsequent proposal could be a good starting point for spurring additional growth on Optimism for Overnight & Optimism. Note :- This proposal was also an edge case at it was included in the cycle round up thread after the defined deadline. As there is no rule or process defined for such scenario, committee is considering this an exception. cc @_Max_plus Our past recommendation is available on committee recommendation thread. ",

                    "content": "   Committees: Next Steps for Season 2   Committees should consider whether proposals are aligned with the near term goals of the Governance Fund: Target L1 applications with PMF: To the extent that people use crypto applications, they should be using those apps on Optimism. The Governance Fund should support the migration of trusted, proven applications currently deployed on L1s. Grow population of values-aligned builders: To be the home for the next wave of novel applications, the Governance Fund should support developers launching novel applications that will draw new users to Optimism. If the grant does not help the Governance Fund achieve either of the above goals, delegates should provide that feedback to proposers and consider not approving the proposal.   We\u2019re truly looking forward to get the best projects, teams on Optimism and to support new projects and innovative applications that can bring new users, liquidity or open up verticals for the Op ecosystem. A larger project that has been around for some time, has 100s of Mio in marketcap and in assets under management, is likely to have a bigger impact in the near-term and give a better return on large co-incentives invested. On the other side, we don\u2019t think you require millions in grant funding to launch an app and get initial traction to prove yourself - before co-incentivizing additional growth. A comprehensive look at track record, AUM, active users, marginal value-add seems to make most sense.     _Max_plus:  On co-incentives, as I said: we are already bribing about 3,500 USD+ per week on Velo, we will increase that to 8,000 if our request is approved. within 10 days we will be allocating 50K over 16 weeks in BAL incentives towards launching a USD+/DAI+ boosted pool on Beets. That\u2019s a total of 250K USD+ in. cash incentives in stables, not in gov tokens. At current rates, thats 295K OP. We are asking the committee to match those co-incentives for the next 25 weeks to be used as bribes at Velodrome and Beets. Importantly, the significant part of those incentives will stay after OP grant expires because of natural yield USD+ generates and uses for incentives   These co-incentives look juicy. Hope to see a slightly adjusted proposal if you don\u2019t get a YES this round. Good luck! ",

Overnight have achieved strong organic growth by any measure on Optimism ($4.5M in a single month, several thousands of wallets, trading volume way above their weight), which is likely to continue as they launch their next wave of products across multiple partner protocols. Their proposal is among the only ones to identify a target user segment, one that does indeed happen to remain active: the risk-averse stablecoin yield maximizer. We think there is plenty of meat on the bone here and see an opportunity to siphon a lot of interest from Mainnet. More broadly, this is a killer team that\u2019s hit the ground running on Optimism with little help, and they\u2019re going after a user segment that remains active in crypto while promising to make more use of a range of DeFi protocols. Their core ask is one that we know lends enduring value-add to Optimism\u2019s DeFi eco, and supporting ETS (i.e., increasing the headroom available) seems like a likely winner as well considering the consistent uptake. They say they want to make Optimism an \u201cinnovation hub\u201d \u2014 we take them at their word. We\u2019ve seen an extraordinary amount of energy and engagement from them in the past month, seemingly everyone\u2019s been hit up for a partnership, and they have a lot of ideas.

We\u2019ll just briefly focus on Op distribution:  50% for Overnight products liquidity mining on Optimism (spread between Velodrome and Balancer)   \u2192 one can discuss the value of liquidity mining but we are largely supportive of this part for a product that is currently gaining traction.  25% for expansion of \"+\"and ETS product lines:   \u2192 these products are very new & we\u2019d like to see more traction before potentially incentivising products that may loose users money.  25% for building insurance product   \u2192 this is very abstract so far, probably makes more sense to resubmit in a follow-up proposal. We felt strongly about this proposal not being at the standard of other proposals when reviewed. Part of this distribution is for products not well-specified and 400K Op is a very large Ask for a new project. Meanwhile we joined a Discord AMA of Overnight which gave us more confidence in the team and we are sure a resubmission for the next cycle focusing on the first product & LM campaign somewhere in the region of 200K OP and future proposals re other products will be better for Overnight and Optimism. That said, good seeing these discussions when they focus on the contents, seeing delegates not blindly following committee decisions and seeing generally support for Overnight from other builders in the ecosystem.

And there is possibility of not using it for development. @OPGovWatch I hope you agree that that possibility exist? Well, this proposal is already on snapshot and most delegates would have voted, so the argument \u2018could\u2019 be medicine after death. General note: If I may ask, Is it possible that the community revisit the idea of allowing projects/proposals  the use of GF for development, maintenance and all that? I see it as giving free money to projects to use as they like and I believe there is that possibility for them using it for something other than development; my opinion though. Advice: I think Optimism Foundation or any other unit within Optimism should co-control any GF going for development/maintenance/audit etc. ",

It is 100% collaterized with high-quality stables (USDC, BUSD, USDT, DAI etc.) that are invested onchain into lowest risk no IL stable-to-stable strategies. The yield from farming is passed over to USD+ holders via rebase. The superpower of USD+ is its ability to pay yield in liquidity pools, thus maximizing capital efficiency of LP provision. Core usecases:  Treasury management Liquidity provision on Dexes (e.g. currently USDC/USD+ on Velodrome) Maximizing yield on projects\u2019 own liquidity on DEXes (e.g. Sphere, OtterClam, Tetu, Parrotly, MDB etc paired against USD+ to receive yield from liquidity they maintain at DEXes)  In addition to USD+, Overnight is offering ETS (\u201cexchange traded strategies\u201d product line). ETS is a quasi-stable (some call it \u2018delta-neutral\u2019 strategy packaged inside a rebase token) that accepts USD+/USDC, uses it as collateral to borrow (hedge) a crypto asset on AAVE (or Granary), then farms crypto-to-stable pools. Currently, on OP there is already ETS ETH/USDC via Velodrome/AAVE and ETS OP/USDC via Velodrome/Granary in process of release. Overnight intends to make Optimism its \u2018innovation hub\u2019, i.e. the chain where all new products/approaches are developed, tried and launched ahead of other chains. Innovative products already implemented include:  \u2018Self-bribing\u2019 LP on Velodrome: USD+ yield from Velodrome LP pools automatically directed towards bribes on Velo Insurance (closed beta): Users are able to exchange risky asset, e.g. ETS ETH/USDC, for a combination of insured and uninsured tokens (tranches), with insured - redeemable for USD+ and uninsured - for OVN, Overnight\u2019s governance token yet to be released -Additional \u2018+\u2019 products: DAI+  There is more in the pipeline. Project links:  Website: Overnight.fi   Twitter: Overnight_fi   Discord Community: Discord   Additional team member info (please link): Telegram: @wmermus LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxim-ermilov/  Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: N/A Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): Overnight went into open beta around May 1st, 2022 and, despite the timing coinciding with the UST crash, has been having great momentum, largely helped by increased risk aversion:  TVL has exceeded 8.5 M USD, x17 growth since UST crash in May (USD+ finalized closed beta and launched open beta on May 1st) number of users has exceeded 3.6K, i.e. x9 growth since May USD+ daily trading volumes have fluctuated in the range of 0.5-1M per day depending on market volatility, on average exceeding 14.5% of TVL, putting USD+ b/w BUSD and USDC on this metric, far ahead of most CDP stablecoins  The growth has been driven by:  Partnerships with Dexes, in particular, Dystopia/Penrose and Cone/Unknown, Velodrome Partnerships with other projects that chose to establish trading pairs with USD+: Lido (stMatic), Sphere, Tetu, OtterClam, MDB, Parrotly Finance etc. Launch of highly attractive (and profitable) product - ETS, a quasi-stable high-yield strategy product on top of USDC/ETH, USD+/wMatic and USD+/wBNB pools (with hedged crypto price-risk) Expansion to BSC and Optimism chains  Overnight entered Optimism about 2 months ago with the launch of USDC/USD+ and USD+/LUSD pools on Velodrome. Since then TVL has exceeded 4.6M with approximately 400 users. Total \u2018bribing\u2019 amount has been 3.5K USD+ per week, most from \u2018self-bribing\u2019 described above. Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes, all contracts are verified and by consequence open-source; 1 math-library, not relating to security of user funds, kept confidential in line with industry-practice not to disclose algorithms related to balancing delta-neutral strategies on Uni V3 (e.g. Gamma.xyz) Optimism native?: Overnight is Polygon native, however, most active part of Overnight community and TVL have migrated to Optimism already once we launched given better product terms on OP. Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Technical deployment - August 2022, commercial launch - first week of September 2022 Ecosystem Value Proposition:   What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? Building ideal DeFi product suite for crypto-winter and beyond: trustworthy, low-risk, decentralised asset management solution for passive stablecoin investors with minimum risk appetite in a convenient \u2018stablecoin\u2019 form factor  How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? Overnight\u2019s vision is to build \u2018Vanguard of DeFi\u2019 with (1) USD+ as a lowest risk product (equivalent of traditional money-market funds) and (2) ETF as a medium risk product (equivalent of ETF). Insurance product will play the central role in de-risking Overnight\u2019s ecosystem of the structural DeFi risks Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? Overnight is targeting risk-averse segment of DeFI (both individuals and treasuries), somewhat underserved segment, which, we believe, over time will overtake crypto-native segment of DeFI in volumes and revenue.  Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? Yes Number of OP tokens requested: 400,000 OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: NA How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): USD+ will provide at least 300K USD+ in co-incentives by (1) channelling USD+ yield from liquidity pools with USD+ and ETS on Velodrome and Balancer to self-bribing and (2) allocating 50K USD worth of BAL received from Balancer for building boosted pool with USD+ on an L2 towards Beethoven\u2019s USDC/DAI boosted pool. Proposal for token distribution:   How will the OP tokens be distributed? 250K for USD+  liquidity mining on Optimism (spread between Velodrome and Balancer). \u2192 This would grow USD+ liquidity on Optimism, but also increase liquidity for the protocols and pairs USD+ collateral is invested into (100% is invested on the same chain). Additional stablecoin yield maximizers with low risk appetite will join Optimism chain 150K for ETS liquidity mining on Optimism (via Velodrome) \u2192 This would grow ETS liquidity on Optimism, but also increase liquidity trading pairs underlying our ETS products, in particular, ETH/USDC and OP/USDC (100% is invested on the same chain). Additional stablecoin yield maximizers with low risk appetite will join Optimism chain   Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? approximately 25 weeks   Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. First KPI will be exceeding 15M in TVL and 2000 users for Overnight overall Second KPI - exceeding 2M in TVL and 100 users for ETS products   Stablecoins like USD+ have considerable network effects. By reaching critical mass of TVL and users, powered by low risk, USD+ and Overnight will realize network effects and make Overnight sustainable on Optimism. Importantly, Overnight generates 'natural yield from its operations, which is partially directed towards USD+ and ETS pool incentives - this combination will make Overnight operation sustainable after rewards expire   Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? Our overall approach is that Overnight products should be attractive without rewards (with rewards used essentially for promotion/marketing only):   USD+ and ETS rely on natural yield on the chain to generate yield for its users   USD+ model we are deploying on Optimisme is \u2018self-bribing\u2019, i.e. natural yield from USD+ and ETS in Velodrome and Beets core pools will support bribes beyond incentives   Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) All Overnight smart contract addresses on Optimism can be found here: Contract Addresses - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta))  We hope the Optimism community will help Overnight not just grow TVL, but push DeFI innovation forward and beyond. Optimism is ideal chain for building things that had not been tried before. Let us know if you have any feedback on the proposal! ",

I\u2019m concerned this ETS distribution will end up in a few addresses contrary to what I think it\u2019s healthy. Is asking for an APY % distribution where the user count is considered too much? Something like: 10 users 5% APY 20 uses 10% APY If not (which is totally understandable) can we lower this to 2 months and come back with some metrics? It won\u2019t look good if we finish this 6 months period and see all these OP tokens distributed to 33 addresses only. I love the project and I want to see it thrive I\u2019m just concerned about user/distribution ratio. ",

The biggest constraints to growth so far, have been, actually, the performance of USD+ itself, which has outperformed ETS in yield (which is not normal and will change as OP ecosystem matures) and depth of liquidity for relevant attractive underlying pairs. we are solving both issues by launching today the ETS based on Uni V3 (via Arrakis) -  \u201cNight over arrakis\u201d. It is delta-neutral strategy aimed at providing liquidity to ETH/USDC 0.05% pool with rewards by Arrakis/Uni/OP. It is quasi-stable strategy with target 15-20% yield, which people are already queuing for. it is deep and long enough for the ETS to acquire 100s of happy users. We have no doubt there will be major demand (enough to ask people in our discord). There is also a \u2018waiting list\u2019 of 40+ addresses. Next week, we will launch another Arrakis-based ETS for ETH/DAI liquidity provision. We can guarantee that everyone will have access to this product and rewards: we have established a stable pool on Velo: USD+/ETS that will (1) use the yield to self-bribe (2) will be the only channel used to distribute grant rewards. So everyone will be guaranteed access and it wont become an \u00ednsider deal\u2019. Responding to your questions more specifically: linking APY and # of users can be done, but incentives via pool on Velo would, imho, be more effective and natural way to balance supply and demand; Regarding metrics, we have put in the proposal \u2018Second KPI - exceeding 2M in TVL and 100 users for ETS products\u2019. if we dont exceed 1M TVL and 100 users within 2 months, we would be happy to stop the grant program and return the remaining part of the grant related to ETS. But i am certain that wont happen. Hope i have addressed your questions. if not, please let me know ",

The re-submitted proposal focuses more clearly on liquidity for the existing products. Value-Add The USD+ stablecoin is 100% collateralized with other stablecoins that are invested on-chain in \u201clow-risk strategies\u201d such as LPing on stables, lending & more. The integration of another yield-generating stable in the Optimism ecosystem can have benefits for Optimism users. With additional incentives, Overnight can add liquidity to key pairs on Optimism and improve efficiency - long-term effectivity & sustainability are yet to be seen for this relatively new project. Traction Overnight is an early stage project that initially attracted liquidity on Polygon and BSC but moved most liquidity to Optimism. It has gathered a total TVL of more than $8+ Mio since its launch on Optimism in early September. The yield strategies have decent APYs but they are so far capped at 100K and have only a few users. Yields will likely go down with higher TVL amounts. Overnight does not have all the contracts public, it has closed open source portfolio rebalancing algorithms behind ETS until at least the public sale of the OVN governance token. Amount 300K OP : Okay for a relatively new project with value-add where long-term functionality & efficiency is yet to be proven:  175K OP for liquidity mining of USD+ (stables) 125K OP for liquidity mining of ETS+ (USDC-ETH, OP-USDC)  Co-incentives 300K USD+ Alignment Overnight has moved towards Optimism and is integrating with Op projects. KPIs Reasonable KPIs but Optimism should also look at the value-added from the additional TVL TVL = 15m USD Users = 2000 Recommendation : YES Our past recommendation is available on committee recommendation thread ",

With additional incentives, Overnight can add liquidity to key pairs on Optimism and improve efficiency - long-term effectivity & sustainability are yet to be seen for this relatively new project. Traction Overnight is an early stage project that initially attracted liquidity on Polygon and BSC but moved most liquidity to Optimism. It has gathered a total TVL of more than $8+ Mio since its launch on Optimism in early September. The yield strategies have decent APYs but they are so far capped at 100K and have only a few users. Yields will likely go down with higher TVL amounts. Overnight does not have all the contracts public, it has closed open source portfolio rebalancing algorithms behind ETS until at least the public sale of the OVN governance token. Amount 300K OP : Okay for a relatively new project with value-add where long-term functionality & efficiency is yet to be proven:  175K OP for liquidity mining of USD+ (stables) 125K OP for liquidity mining of ETS+ (USDC-ETH, OP-USDC)  Co-incentives 300K USD+ Alignment Overnight has moved towards Optimism and is integrating with Op projects. KPIs Reasonable KPIs but Optimism should also look at the value-added from the additional TVL TVL = 15m USD Users = 2000 Recommendation : YES   ",
