I see a few previous posts that didn\u2019t get much traction (STAKE https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stake-mip6-collateral-onboarding-application/5551 and rETH https://forum.makerdao.com/t/reth-mip6-collateral-application/6881). Eventually Coinbase and other platforms are going to have ERC20 tokens representing staked ETH2.0, in addition to solutions like Rocket Pool. I have a bunch of eth staked on various validators that I would love to use as collateral. The risk seems relatively the same against normal ETH. ",

                    "content": "I think that tweet thread is misleading in some important ways. First, I think Lido actually takes a 10% cut, leaving 90% of all staking income to holders of stETH. The lower yield cited is because new deposits take a long time to come online, and that is socialized. The upside, though, is you start earning immediately upon deposit. If you want to run your own node you also need to wait a long time for it to come online, and earn nothing during that time. Regarding liquidity, the Curve stETH pool has 1.7 Billion dollars of liquidity and is trading very close to parity. Right now you can sell 10,000 stETH for 9990.25 ETH.  Not sure why anyone would all that \u201cilliquid\u201d. Edit: Add citations below. Staking rewards fee 10% Lido\u2019s APR is currently lower than Ethereum\u2019s APR due to the activation queue for ETH validators as well as Lido\u2019s staking rewards fee. Lido\u2019s APR will grow as the rate of active stakers on Lido becomes higher, but will not exceed Ethereum\u2019s APR. With Lido, you receive staking rewards within 24 hours of your deposit being made, without waiting for validator activation. ",
