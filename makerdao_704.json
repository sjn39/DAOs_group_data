                    "content": " Maker Academy\u2019s First Status Update!   1556\u00d7854 113 KB   If you would like to see a more in-depth status update, please scroll below to the section titled \u201cMaker Academy In-Depth Status Update\u201d. Maker Academy has finished the mock-up of its website and is en route to completing and releasing an initial version of the website by the end of March 2022.   Currently, the website\u2019s account, sign in, content, about us, and programs pages are complete, except for testing, documentation, and a final review.   The website\u2019s contributor pipelines, creator studio, and performance pages have yet to be developed.   Content for the incubation program and onboarding programs are coming soon! Maker Academy has prioritized website development, but is now focusing on content production. Currently, Maker Academy plans to have the initial release of the website contain content relating to SES\u2019s incubation program. . . . . . . .  Maker Academy In-Depth Status Update (#1)  Preface  Purpose The purpose of this document is to inform Maker Academy\u2019s stakeholders that Maker Academy continues to be a good investment. This is accomplished by dictating how Maker Academy\u2019s day-to-day tasks improve MakerDAO by addressing the needs of the internal and external Maker community. In order to keep stakeholders \u201cin the loop\u201d but not overwhelm them with content, Maker Academy\u2019s status updates occur once a month (at the time of this post).  Author This document was written by Colby Anderson, the facilitator of Maker Academy, and reviewed by Zach Huang, a project manager of Maker Academy.  Special Note At the time of this post, Maker Academy is an incubating core unit under SES, making stakeholders of SES indirectly stakeholders of Maker Academy.  Community Need #1 [Onboarding Material] There is currently a lack of onboarding material for MakerDAO, thereby making it difficult for new contributors to make significant contributions to MakerDAO. Onboarding material compresses a new contributor\u2019s learning curve, allowing them to make better contributions at a faster rate.  Task A [Full-time Content Producer] To maximize the rate of content production, Maker Academy will both create content and facilitate content. At the time of this post, Maker Academy has two members possessing the skill to produce content, but they are preoccupied with other tasks. As a result, Maker Academy is cooperating with Maker Talent to search for qualified candidates with the expectation of hiring a full-time content producer.  Progress: There have been over 20 interviews for this position and screening of over 100 candidates. There are many candidates, but not many qualified candidates. There are two potential qualified candidates that are moving to the final stage in the interview process at the time of this post. Deliverable: TBA [deliverable will be when the position is fulfilled.]   Task B [Content Bounties] In order to scale content production, Maker Academy plans to incentivize a decentralized workflow of content production with the use of content bounties. For certain educational topics, MakerDAO will create DAI bounties as opposed to hiring experts for short periods of time to produce niche content.  Progress: At the time of this post, this idea is somewhat new. The kinks are still being fleshed out to ensure a maintainable bounty program that accomplishes Maker Academy\u2019s goals. Deliverable: TBA [deliverable will be when the content bounties are implemented through the website.]   Task C [Incubation Program] Maker Academy has to prioritize content production based on MakerDAO\u2019s needs. Currently, the largest sector of onboarding happens within SES through their incubation program. In order to help scale the incubation program, Maker Academy will cooperate with SES in the production of educational content that can be used during the incubation program.  Progress: Maker Academy has written an outline for the section of the incubation course detailing the role of the facilitator. SES has also been preparing content so far. Deliverable: TBA [deliverable will be when the incubation program content is complete and on the website]   Community Need #2 [Contributor Pipelines] MakerDAO does not provide a clear pathway for prospective contributors to become actual contributors, which hinders the growth of Maker\u2019s talent pool. The creation of contributor pipelines will increase the amount of potential contributors that MakerDAO can draw from, ensuring we have the most qualified contributors.  Task A [Contributor Portal UI] A contributor pipeline needs to explain the different methods of contribution, list current opportunities for contribution, teach the necessary skill to make these contributions, and record potential contributors\u2019 progress for potential employers. Maker Academy\u2019s educational site will already be tracking users and showing content. In order to complete the pipeline, Maker Academy will have a contributor portal that explains the different methods of contribution and lists current opportunities for contribution.  Progress: The content mock-up for the contributor portal is almost complete at the time of this post. Also, for what has been done for the mock-up, it is currently being implemented on the website. Deliverable: TBA [deliverable will be when the contributor portal is released on the website]   Community Need #3 [Primary Educational Platform] The current educational material for MakerDAO is spread across multiple sites, limiting MakerDAO\u2019s SEO and making learners struggle to find their desired MakerDAO-related information.  Task A [Mock-up] There are many problems Maker Academy wanted to solve with their website. In order to provide a concrete representation of the solutions and to set the model for the rest of the website development, a mock-up needs to be made.  Written Progress: The mock-up is a content mock-up as opposed to a UI mock-up, hence the unstylish deliverable. At the time of this post, the mock-up covers most of the website, but a few pages are yet to be completed. It is important to note that during the current development of the website, not all ideas from the mock-up were used; in other words, the website is not a mirror image of the mock-up in style or in content. Deliverable: https://www.figma.com/file/v7IyGyMD35fh3MOZQF4Pi7/Maker-Academy-Mockup?node-id=0%3A1    Task B [Front End MVP] Every website should have an elegant and functional UI, and Maker Academy is no different. Maker Academy plans to improve upon past educational websites released by the Maker Community by adding many more useful features when it comes to education.  Progress: At the time of this post, the front end has been completed for most pages besides the contributor portal, the creator studio (where content is created), and the performance page (where Maker Academy\u2019s success metrics are displayed). However, these pages still need to be tested, documented, and reviewed. Deliverable: TBA [deliverable will be when the website is released]   Task C [Back End MVP] Maker Academy, like all websites, needs a back end. Maker Academy is using MongoDB to store its data. Maker Academy will eventually have to store a lot of content and user information, so it is important to optimize it.  Progress: The schema for users, content, and programs (sequences of content) is complete. However, at the time of this post, the backend for the contributor portal, the analytics engine, and the backend for the \u201cabout us\u201d page still needs to developed. Deliverable: TBA [deliverable will be when the website is released]  ",

I would caution against this for topics that require in-depth knowledge of Maker.

The time required for knowledgeable individuals to proof-read, evaluate, etc ends up eating into the theoretical efficiency of paying someone else to produce the content.   There are many ways of implementing this \u201ccontent bounty\u201d scalability solution. One way (and its slight variations) has the problem you mentioned; I\u2019ll detail the implementation and it\u2019s potential problem for clarification: Implementation - Maker Academy posts content bounties. Users submit content. Maker Academy selects the best one, initiates an editing process with the submitter, and then posts the content when it is perfect. Problem - The submitters are not qualified enough and write very poor material with many mistakes. As a result, the editing process takes a long time, almost to the extent that Maker Academy has to write the piece themselves\u2026thus not solving the scalability issue\u2026and there is now the overhead of reading everyone\u2019s submissions. As you mentioned, this may not matter as much on certain topics, but to some extent, it is always a possible problem, no matter the topic. Currently, we are focusing on another implementation that doesn\u2019t have this particular problem. The implementation is rather complicated and has some of its own nuanced issues and solutions. However, I would rather wait on describing it, since this other implementation isn\u2019t fully worked out yet.     LongForWisdom:  I took a look at the concepts, I guess my main question was around the account creation process. Will account creation be required to access educational content? Or will it be purely optional?   Account creation will NOT be required to access educational content. We are creating accounts for other features that we will be offering, such as certificates for completing courses, measuring progress, etc. Lastly, thank you for your feedback and advice. As always, I greatly appreciate it! If you ever have any ideas about Maker Academy, feel free to reach me on discord  ",
