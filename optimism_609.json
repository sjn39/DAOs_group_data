We completed 2 events so far on Galxe, and all events were on Optimism Ecosystem\u2026 Dappad Galxe Event Nft Contract : Dappad Testnet Event (APPATEST) Token Tracker | Optimism In 2 events we Dappad contributed 3.960 TX in Optimism Ecosystem.  image945\u00d7527 58.2 KB  Crew3 Missions  image945\u00d7875 96 KB  How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism: We at Dappad Launchpad can maximize the impact of Optimism\u2019s Grant Op by strategically (The Strategy is on page 10 shown as a table) deploying the funds to benefit the ecosystem. We plan to fund and support promising projects and protocols that align with the Optimism community\u2019s goals and values. Additionally, we aim to assign tasks to users in active ecosystem projects and distribute rewards to successful completers. We believe that creating a competitive grant program will be an effective way to invite proposals from Optimism-built projects, partner with established protocols, or offer mentorship programs to accelerate development and ensure projects are well-positioned for success. By strategically distributing grant funds to impactful projects and initiatives, we can foster growth and innovation in the Optimism ecosystem, contributing to its long-term success and the broader blockchain industry. Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.: Dappad Launchpad could target investors interested in Optimism-based projects and protocols with the grant, in line with its purpose of supporting the growth and development of projects on the Optimism ecosystem. Optimism-specific investors - These could include venture capital firms, angel investors, or cryptocurrency investors who are specifically interested in investing in projects and protocols built on the Optimism ecosystem. Early adopters of Optimism- These could include individuals who have been involved in the Optimism ecosystem from its early stages and are interested in supporting its growth and development. DeFi investors - These could include investors who are interested in supporting projects that are part of the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which is closely tied to the Optimism ecosystem. Institutional investors with an interest in blockchain technology - These could include venture capital firms or other financial institutions that are interested in investing in emerging blockchain technologies and startups. Overall, the target audience for Dappad Launchpad with the Optimism grant would be investors who are specifically interested in supporting the growth and development of projects and protocols built on the Optimism ecosystem. It\u2019s important for Dappad Launchpad to tailor its marketing and outreach efforts to reach these specific investor audiences and provide them with the necessary information and resources to make informed investment decisions. How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: According to the working logic of Dappad Launchpad, there is an obligation to stake Dappad tokens in the Optimism ecosystem for large projects to be funded in Launchpad. This staking is required in order to participate in the pre-sale of these large projects. The purpose of this staking is to incentivize token holders to participate in the Launchpad, and to reward them with part of the grant received by Dappad. By staking their tokens, users will not only earn token rewards with low interest rates, but also have the opportunity to participate in high-quality projects launching on the platform. In the long run, the fact that Dappad is funding good projects and achieving successful launches will allow people to become more familiar with the Optimism ecosystem and with Dappad. As Dappad gains more recognition and credibility within the community, it is likely that more users will become interested in staking their tokens and participating in Launchpad activities, leading to increased adoption of the Optimism ecosystem as a whole.

(TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): We did 2 activities on Galxe, 1 activity on Crew3 with our community that they can attend at a certain time. We kept the time interval short and increased the interest. And all our activities are done on Optimism. We do not have any kind of metrics determined in question, because Dappad has not been launched yet. With our future events, we aim to do more Optimism transactions with our community in a longer period of time. Dappad Testnet Event (APPATEST) Token Tracker | Optimism Who are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?: It may seem like it has many competitors due to the De-Fi protocols currently, but there is no Launchpad available on Optimism. Dappad is the first of Optimism as both a launchpad and an investment point. Please link to code audits (if any): We don\u2019t have yet but we plan to have Team: Ba\u015faran Culha / CMO: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ba\u015faran/ Umut \u00c7\u0131nar / Blockchain Dev: https://www.linkedin.com/in/umut-cinar/ Can \u00d6zfuttu / Front end Dev: https://www.linkedin.com/in/canozfuttu/ Ba\u015far Mahmutluo\u011flu / BD of Marketing: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmahmutluoglu/ Taylan Sa\u011f\u0131r / BD of Marketing: https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylansagir/ Ferhat \u00d6zdemir / Community Manager: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferhato6zdemir/ Who are your founders?: Umut Garip: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ugarip/ Berkay Guven: https://www.linkedin.com/in/berkayguven/ Deniz Dervisoglu: https://www.linkedin.com/in/denizdervisoglu/ What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal? The Dappad team consists of 9 professional members and all team members are Doxxed. All of the team members have gained experience in many different projects in many different fields in the past. And with the combination of these common Experiences, Dappad began to be formed. Is this your first Web3 project?: The team members separately has worked with different projects in the past, but Dappad is a startup from scratch. If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): TrustPad (Launchpad) Tegisto (Decentralized Exchange) / Not Launched yet As Umut Garip is Co Founder of Alpha Capital, He has been incubating 2 projects right now called; Devium, and ShopCek Devium (Market place for Developers) / Not Launched yet ShopCek (E-Commerce Market Place) / Not Launched yet Grant Request  What is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 92.000 OP How do you justify the size of the grant?: At Dappad, we have multiple grant-related plans and programs. The process, which will begin with the conversion of communities that believe in optimism into an investor mass, continues with projects in different networks and Dappad acting as a bridge for the investor community to become Optimistic. During this process, partnerships will be established with various projects on Optimism and this grant will be distributed through various missions that will benefit the Optimism ecosystem. 230k Op is not enough when marketing and personal community rewards are included in these programs. As the Dappad team, we will be more active in grants and applications as our success is proven. Roadmap and Distribution Plan Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan: In order to support the growth of the platform and attract more investors, the team behind Dappad has decided to distribute the donated Op\u2019 token among investors participating in events with other projects in the Optimism Ecosystem. The first 50% of the token will be distributed before launch, rest will be distributed after the launch to investors participating in events with other projects in the Optimism Ecosystem, and the focus will be on encouraging these projects to become solution partners and organizing events to promote the Dappad Launchpad. This distribution plan is designed to help build a strong network of partners and supporters for the Dappad Launchpad, as well as attract more investors to the platform. By collaborating with other projects in the Optimism Ecosystem, Dappad hopes to create a thriving community of blockchain enthusiasts who can work together to support the growth of the platform. To further incentivize investors to participate in the Dappad Launchpad, the team has also implemented a staking mechanism. In order to participate in projects launched after the launch of the Dappad Token, investors will have to stake their Dappad tokens. In return, they will receive some amount (shown below) of Dappad token income and OP tokens as a loyalty reward. 20.000 quantities of OP will be distributed before launch as soon as events / competitions are over. It will be disturbed according to ranking on competitions and transaction participants make on events 72.000 quantities of OP will be distributed after launch 22.000 of them tokens will be distributed to those who make the most transactions on the      Optimism Ecosystem with Appa tokens in proportion to their transactions. Note: A minimum transaction      number will be announced. 50.000 of them will be distributed to those who staked their Appa Tokens on dappad.app (Min requirement of staked Appa token will be announced) This staking mechanism is designed to prevent inflation and encourage investors to hold their tokens for longer periods of time. By staking their Dappad tokens, investors can earn a small amount of income while also contributing to the growth of the platform. This, in turn, will cause the Total Value Locked (TVL) on the platform to grow further, creating more opportunities for investors to earn rewards. In conclusion, the distribution plan for the granted Op\u2019 token for the Dappad Launchpad is designed to support the growth of the platform and attract more investors. By collaborating with other projects in the Optimism Ecosystem and implementing a staking mechanism, Dappad hopes to create a thriving community of blockchain enthusiasts who can work together to support the growth of the platform. How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. See the no sale rule here):  image945\u00d7733 139 KB  The Op Tokens will be distributed in the name of loyalty reward for participants who attend Dappad Launchpad\u2019s events with partners and stake Dappad Tokens after the Launch. The distribution will increase gradually each week as more participants attend the events. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?: 12 week Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project.
