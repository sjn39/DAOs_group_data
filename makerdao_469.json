                    "content": "1.\tIntroduction I have been tracking the discussions here on the Maker forum this past year with regard to various possibilities for sustainable capital to be used as MakerDAO vault collateral (specifically, SolarX and the recent MDI proposals). From my perspective as a renewable energy finance person, I believe these ideas have a great deal of merit, and there are a lot of synergies between the two worlds. In support of the current focus on using sustainable RWA collateral in MakerDAO vaults, this memo is intended to serve as a brief introduction to the credit analysis of renewable energy projects. Hopefully, this write-up is something useful to the Maker community. The credit analysis of renewable energy projects involves an assessment of the risks taken during the short-term construction period and the long-term operations of a project. Depending on the profile of the investor and their investment timeline (e.g., construction lender vs. permanent long-term lender), it is important to evaluate the most likely or impactful risks that can occur during the relevant investment window. All projects involve some risk, and at least some of the issues identified below are present with any transaction. However, risks that are likely to occur or risks that pose a major risk to the project must be successfully mitigated in order for a project to be considered a strong investment. To keep this memo manageable, all the requirements of a full financial model audit are not listed here. However, all of the risks below are considered in conjunction with the financial model to calculate the impact of these risks and evaluate a project\u2019s ability to weather adverse events. 2.\tStructuring of Renewable Energy Projects Nearly all renewable energy projects are structured as project finance transactions. This means a non-recourse (no recourse to the owners beyond the assets of the project) structured finance arrangement where all assets of the power plant are owned by a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) created specifically to own the project. Under a project finance transaction, all debt and equity invested in the project are paid back from cash flows generated by the asset. In addition, nearly all legal agreements entered into are between the project SPV and the counterparty. While the intent of a project finance transaction is for the project to operate independent of the original developer of the project (also called the \u201csponsor\u201d), it is not uncommon for financing parties to require the sponsor to perform certain duties to support the project. A typical project finance structure is shown below:  pforg742\u00d7309 8.11 KB  The typical legal agreements between the main parties of a project finance transaction are shown above. However, the most important legal agreement is the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) which sets out the conditions required for the buyer (also called the \u201cofftaker\u201d) to pay for the power generated by the project as well as the conditions to be met for formal recognition that commercial operations have begun. A detailed analysis of all agreements involved requires experienced legal counsel, which is outside of this review. However, a review of key bankability points for PPAs is below at the bottom of this document. 3.\tMajor Renewable Energy Project Risks Below are the key risks to consider when evaluating a renewable energy project: a.\tConstruction Risk The overwhelming majority of the project budget is used to construct the power plant, with the remainder used for soft costs such as development costs, engineering, land purchases, deposits, advisory fees, etc. After a project is mechanically complete (all hardware is in place), it undergoes a well-defined commissioning process which is a series of tests and protocols to demonstrate and document that the plant performs as anticipated. Nearly all PPAs require a project to achieve minimum performance criteria in order for the agreement to remain valid and for payments to be made. The risk of meeting these minimum performance criteria, as well as the risk of delivering the project on time and on budget are primarily the responsibility of the construction contractor, often referred to as the Engineer-Procure-Construct (EPC) Contractor. If there is a separate construction loan, such as the MDI proposal, a failure of the EPC contractor to demonstrate the performance of the system during commissioning will put the requirement of the term lender to take out the construction loan in jeopardy. Key questions to ask to understand construction risk:  Is the EPC contractor experienced with similar projects in this geography? Do they have a documented history of delivering projects on time and on budget? Can the EPC contractor reasonably complete the project before the commercial operation date (COD) as defined in the PPA? Does the PPA provide a mechanism to accommodate a reasonable construction delay, or is the PPA canceled if the COD date is not met? Does the EPC agreement include penalties (liquidated damages or \u201cLDs\u201d) for delay and performance issues that a) appropriately compensate for the delay (cover interest charges, fees owed under the PPA for underperformance, etc.) and b) motivate the EPC contractor to perform?  Does the EPC contractor have the liquid funds available to cover the LDs? If the EPC contractor\u2019s obligations are guaranteed by another entity, does that entity have the creditworthiness and liquid funds available to honor the guarantee? If applicable, what are the performance requirements required by a term lender to take out the construction loan, and are these reasonable and achievable?   Is the construction budget considered market for similar projects (typically on a $/MW basis)? Are payment milestones under the EPC contract subject to retainage requirements, meaning a portion is withheld until construction is complete? Is there a reasonable contingency (3-5%+) included in the total budget to support increased construction costs? Are the equipment suppliers facing any supply constraints that could lead to a delayed or failed delivery, which could cause the project to miss key deadlines under the PPA?  This has been a problem during the pandemic. As a result of constraints, prices have also risen, which gives suppliers an incentive to renegotiate existing agreements at lower prices.   Is the technology to be used proven, and is it applicable to this use and environment?  Consider if extreme heat or extreme cold pose a risk to the technology. This is especially important to evaluate with energy storage.   If the major equipment is being purchased separately from the EPC agreement (typically to avoid the EPC contractor charging a margin on equipment), do the LD terms of the two agreements (supply agreement and EPC agreement) create a conflict if the two firms blame each other? Are the main equipment suppliers reputable, and do they have strong credit?  Do the specific products have a history of recall or product defects?   Is the lender and/or equity investor supported by a strong engineer to monitor construction progress? At each disbursement of funds, are the funds left available to the project (debt and equity) sufficient to fully complete the project?  b.\tOfftaker Risk Because all revenues of the project will come from the offtaker of the PPA, the creditworthiness, track record, and liquid assets of the offtaker are critically important. Most offtakers are utilities, which often have a credit rating assigned from the credit rating agencies and are often investment grade (>BBB- for S&P/Fitch, and >Baa3 for Moody\u2019s), government entities, or corporate offtakers, which can have credit quality all over the place. Key questions to ask to understand offtaker risk:  Is the price to be paid per unit of energy (the \u201ctariff\u201d) competitive with alternative sources of power available to the offtaker? Was the PPA awarded as a result of a competitive process, or was it the result of direct negotiation?  If a direct negotiation, are better options available to the offtaker?   What is the credit quality of the offtaker?  If weak, consider if credit enhancements such as a letter of credit in favor of the seller or a guarantee of the offtaker\u2019s obligations by another party (such as a parent company) would provide adequate comfort.   Does the offtaker have a history of profitable earnings, or have they run losses in recent history?  If a history of losses, are the losses a threat to the business, or are they manageable?   Does the offtaker have a documented history of timely payment? What is typical?  Consider including an additional month or two of operating expenses in the total project budget, as the first invoice is often the slowest to be paid, and sponsors often under budget for working capital.   Does the offtaker have the liquid assets (preferably as cash) to honor its obligations to pay a termination payment in accordance with the PPA?  c.\tEquity Contribution Risk It is critical that the total sources of capital (debt, equity, etc.) be equal to the total project costs. Forms of capital beyond debt and equity (e.g., subordinated debt, shareholder loans, mezzanine capital) are often used and are more common for large projects where the additional complexity is worth it. In most renewable energy projects, the ideal capital stack is with a majority of the financing coming from low-interest senior debt (75-80% of total project costs), with the remainder coming from equity (to include tax equity in the U.S.) or sources of capital subordinated to the senior loan. Lenders prefer that the equity investor have a meaningful investment in the project (20%+) so that they have enough skin in the game to be motivated to resolve problems instead of abandoning the project if there is a problem. A lender\u2019s obligations are typically well-defined in the loan agreement, and the capacity of the lender to provide the funds is generally certain; however, this is not always the case with the equity investors who are often smaller, with less cash available, and often do not enter into extremely formal legal commitments to contribute their equity. To minimize the risk of an equity investor failing to provide their required contribution, lenders prefer that the equity investment be contributed first, with debt stepping in after the equity contribution is made. The equity investor\u2019s return on equity is negatively impacted by contributing equity earlier in the project timeline (also, this is when their equity is at greatest risk), and as a result, equity investors are motivated to put their equity in at a later date. A common compromise is for funds from debt and equity to be contributed pari passu \u2013 disbursed pro-rata according to the percentage of total funds to be contributed by each. The least desirable arrangement is for the equity investor to contribute their equity last. However, both situations expose the lender to the risk that the equity investor might fail to provide their contribution. To solve this issue, lenders often require the equity investor to provide a letter of credit (provided by a bank) equal to the outstanding amount of equity to be contributed that the lenders can drawdown if the equity investor fails to provide funds directly. Letters of credit cost money, and equity investors can be resistant to paying for them. Key questions to ask to understand equity-related risks:  Do the total sources of cash (debt/equity) equal the total uses of cash?  Ensure budgets for development costs, legal fees, banking fees, interest during construction (IDC), insurance, contingency, funding of reserves, initial working capital (which provides for the first month or two of operating expenses while waiting for invoices to be paid).   When is the equity being contributed? First, pari passu, or last?  If equity is not going in first, consider requiring a letter of credit from a bank with a strong credit rating to support their obligations.   What is the credit rating and/or financial situation of the equity investor?  Confirm the equity investor has the liquid funds available.   What is the minimum equity contribution as a percentage of total project costs?  If less than 20%, consider requesting more or requesting additional parent guarantees to provide additional equity or support in the event of a problem.   If applicable, will the project satisfy the requirements to qualify for tax incentives such as deadlines to begin construction or achieve commercial operations? Is there a formal equity contribution agreement requiring the equity investor to provide the minimum amount of funds? What entity signed this agreement?  d.\tResource Risk Most renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind projects, generate intermittent or irregular power, as they generate only when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. However, while the exact daily output of any plant is not predictable, over longer periods of time the output of a facility will fall within a statistical range that can be projected accurately. The calculation of this statistical range, and the dataset used to calculate it, are of paramount importance to investors in renewable energy projects. For predictable, dispatchable power sources such as geothermal, hydroelectric, or thermal systems, the resource risk is lower but not eliminated. Resource risk is not a major concern for construction lending (such as with the MDI MIP6 proposal) but is a concern if taking exposure during operations. The annual output of a renewable energy project is modeled using specific software tools, which account for the geographic location, historical weather, specific models of equipment to be used, the configuration of the system, and many other factors. For solar projects, solar data measured on-site is better, but many projects move forward using satellite-based data. Projections for wind projects should not be trusted without at least 12-24 months of data. The most likely output of a project is called the P50 output, meaning that it has a 50% probability of exceeding that output. In other words, it is anticipated that 50% of the time the project will generate at least this amount. The typical stress test applied to a project is the P99 output, or the output at which it has a 99% probability of exceeding. Put another way, P99 is the worst year you would expect out of 100 years. The range between P50 and P99 calculations for solar projects is typically closer together than for wind projects, as solar energy is generally more consistent than wind. It is typical for engineers representing the investors in a project to review the sponsor\u2019s output projections. The chart below details the relationship between the annual generation (x-axis) and the probability of exceeding that generation (y-axis):  p50p99930\u00d7223 9.74 KB  Source: Solargis How are P50 and P99 used? The base case financial projections are based on the P50 projection, and P99 projections are used to stress test the financial model. The key ratio to evaluate for renewable energy projects is the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), which is the ratio of cash flow available to debt service (CFADS) to debt service in a given period. CFADS is typically revenues, less operating expenses, less capital expenditures, less taxes. It is important to note that CFADS is measured on a cash basis and can differ from the figures on financial statements, which measure on an accrual basis. The standard DSCR for a solar project is 1.30x, meaning there is projected to be $1.30 in cash flow for every $1.00 in debt service (both principal and interest) in any period. Typically, a project is evaluated if it can achieve at least a 1.00x DSCR under a P99 scenario. If not, adjustments are made to account for this scenario. Most solar projects have a DSCR significantly above 1.00x under a P99 scenario, but many wind projects do not, given the wider range of outcomes for wind projects, and need to tailor the debt payments to account for these periods. A final consideration for resource risk is the degradation of a renewable energy project over time, which results from regular wear and tear, and exposure to the elements. Many solar projects assume 0.5%-0.7% annual degradation, but recent studies indicate that the real degradation is closer to 1% per year, which is a significant difference over 10-20 years. Other projects such as wind projects also suffer degradation, but in a less linear fashion due to scheduled maintenance and overhauls of the wind turbines. Key questions to ask to understand resource risk:  What software and source data were used to develop the energy generation projections? Do the generation projections include a budget for downtime for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, grid unavailability, and maintenance to the transmission line/substation connecting to the project? Has an independent engineer reviewed these projections? If on-site solar/wind was measured, what is the length of time the data was collected? What is the assumed annual degradation of the system?  If >0.7%, consider increasing to 1.0%    e.\tReserve Accounts Non-recourse project finance transactions must stand on their own, without financial support from any other entity. As a source of cash to be used for unexpected or major events, most projects have dedicated reserve accounts to fund major capital expenditure events (e.g., schedule equipment replacement or major maintenance) or to support the project in the event of a problem. The two most common reserve accounts renewable energy projects have are the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) and the Major Maintenance Reserve Account (MMRA). These reserve accounts are funded at the end of construction when commercial operations begin and are funded according to the timing of when the debt and equity investors disburse their cash into the project (e.g., equity first, pari passu, or equity last, per the \u201cEquity Contribution Risk\u201d section above). DSRA The purpose of the DSRA is to serve as a dedicated reserve to support debt service obligations in the event of a cash flow issue. A failure to pay debt service is typically an immediate event of default, so the equity investors should be motivated to have this reserve to protect their interests. It is not an emergency fund to use for any problem that may occur, but at the discretion of the lender, it can be used for other purposes to resolve an issue. The DSRA is typically sized based on the next six months of debt service, but less risky projects sometimes are sized to three months. Given the DSRA is a large amount of cash sitting in a bank account not earning a meaningful return, it is a drag on the return on equity, which can motivate project sponsors to push for a smaller DSRA or for one funded out of project cash flows (instead of included in the total project budget upfront). This should be resisted. MMRA Major maintenance events, such as overhauls of equipment or the replacement of equipment that will not last the life of the project (e.g., inverters), are expensive, and the cost can exceed what the project can sustain out of regular cash flows. To ensure a project has enough cash to handle these events, an MMRA is established as a savings account so that when the maintenance event occurs, there is enough cash to pay for it. Typically, the MMRA is funded over time in small amounts out of project cash flows, but it is also common for some amount to be pre-funded out of the original project budget. Many solar projects do not have an MMRA because the maintenance costs do not require them. Most other technologies should require an MMRA. However, the inverters (which convert the DC power generated to AC power to be exported to the grid) used in solar projects go bad in 5-7 years, and there needs to be a budget or warranty in place to replace them when they fail over the life of the project. Key questions to ask to understand reserve account-related risks:  Are the reserve accounts pre-funded from the initial total project budget, or are they funded over time? What if a negative event (such as a late payment from the offtaker) happens before the reserve is filled up? Is the reserve large enough to support a likely issue? If the project does not have an MMRA, is there a budget for hardware replacement or a warranty in place with the manufacturer that will replace equipment when it goes bad? How does the MMRA funding align with the manufacturer-suggested scheduled maintenance program? Are the projected maintenance costs escalated for inflation, or are they in today\u2019s dollars?  f.\tLand Risk The ability to use the land the project is to be located on is fundamental to an investor\u2019s interests in the project. If a project does not have clear rights to use the land (land title), and if the land is not zoned (by local authorities) to allow for power generation, the project will be in serious jeopardy. Land rights issues are typically handled by a local attorney familiar with the relevant real estate laws and regulations, but they are fundamental to the project. Environmental and social risks associated with the land should also be considered, such as if the land is considered critical habitat for endangered species, is in the migratory pattern of endangered birds, or if the project will cause a nuisance for neighbors for issues such as noise, stormwater runoff, dust, or other issues related to the construction and operations. These issues are typically a bigger problem for large-scale projects but should be considered for all projects. Key questions to ask to understand land-related risks:  Does the project have a clear title to the land, or is there a potential for a dispute? Can the project get title insurance? If the land is being leased, is the lease agreement strong, and does the lessor have clear title to the land? Is the land zoned appropriately for a renewable energy project? If you need to go through another property to access the project, or if the project is located at a property controlled by another party, does the project have rights to access the project site to effectively construct, operate, and maintain the project? Is the project site located near an endangered species critical habitat area, national park, or is located in a migratory bird path?  Has an environmental and social impact assessment been performed that outlines methods to mitigate these risks?    g.\tOperations and Maintenance (O&M) Risk As a project nears completion, the O&M contractor ramps up and then assumes responsibility for the operations and maintenance of the project upon the beginning of commercial operations (this handoff to be specified in the EPC Agreement and O&M Agreement). If and when a problem arises, it will likely be the responsibility of the O&M contractor to implement the solution. However, issues can arise during operations that are covered by the warranty provided by the EPC contractor. It is common for project sponsors to retain the EPC contractor as the O&M contractor in the early years of a project, and especially during any warranty or performance period (a period during which the EPC contractor is responsible for the project hitting certain performance metrics). Using the EPC contractor as the O&M contractor is often more expensive than other options, and project sponsors will likely transition to another operator after a few years. The O&M contractor will often guarantee the uptime of a project or the percentage of time that it is operational and will pay liquidated damages for failure to hit that target. This is not the same as the performance of the plant, as the O&M contractor\u2019s position is that that is the responsibility of the EPC contractor or the equipment manufacturer. O&M contractors can also provide performance guarantees, but these are typically below what is provided by the EPC contractor. The damages to be paid by the O&M contractor for failure to hit targets typically do not fully compensate for the financial loss, as they are calculated as a percentage of the O&M contract value, which is small when compared to the original total investment. Key questions to ask to understand O&M risks:  Does the O&M contractor have experience operating similar projects in this geography? Is the O&M cost high? Alternatively, do long-term O&M cost assumptions account for increases or inflation? Does the O&M agreement include liquidated damages sufficient to motivate the contractor to perform? Does the total project budget include a spare parts inventory to be available to the O&M contractor?  h.\tOther Risks There are many other risks to consider when evaluating a renewable energy project, but the major risks are described above. Other general questions to consider include:  Does the project have adequate insurance coverage, and are the deductibles reasonable? Does the total project budget include everything needed for the project to achieve commercial operations?  Consider deposits needed for letters of credit to counterparties, insurance, legal costs, third-party engineers, travel, adequate contingency, development fees, working capital to carry the first few months of operations before payment is received, etc.   Does the project involve any currency or commodity (copper, etc.) risk? Does the financial model accurately calculate taxes due and consider any local taxes or fees that must be paid? Is the sponsor using their position to pull money out of the project prematurely?  If the sponsor is also the EPC contractor, they can use this to get fees out early or overcharge the project. If the sponsor is also operating the project, is the price cost-competitive? When is the development fee (success fee) paid out to the sponsor?    4.\tPower Purchase Agreements (PPAs) The PPA is an agreement between the offtaker of electricity and the generator (seller) of the electricity, and defines the terms for the sale of electricity, the rights of the generator, and determines the process to be followed if something goes wrong. The PPA defines the tariff and how it is to be escalated over time (typically to account for inflation). PPAs should always cover the entire period of time necessary to pay back all debt and realize the projected return. PPAs are typically awarded either on a negotiated basis directly between the offtaker and the sponsor of the project or are awarded as a result of a competitive process such as a reverse auction. While now less common, some areas have feed-in tariffs (FiTs), which will award a PPA at an established tariff to any project meeting specific criteria. Below are key \u201cbankability\u201d criteria to be considered when reviewing a PPA. Many financing parties will refuse to finance a transaction if it contains too many problematic issues and is deemed to be \u201cunbankable\u201d: a.\tFixed Tariff: Tariffs should be fixed and not calculated as a function of market pricing, such as a percentage discount to the wholesale market or the utility\u2019s regulated tariff. A non-fixed tariff is problematic for a long-term debt investor, as the principal and interest payment are determined when the loan is disbursed, and a floating tariff renders the ability of the project to reliably pay back specific amounts less reliable. The tariff should also be competitive with a) alternative pricing on the grid and b) typical tariffs for similar projects. Offtakers will be highly motivated to have a dispute with the seller, delay payment, or even attempt to terminate a PPA if the tariff is not competitive. Due to the constantly falling cost of renewable energy (primarily solar, but also wind to some extent), PPAs awarded several years ago might still be legally valid but will have a high tariff that is no longer competitive. b.\tDispatch Risk: A power plant is \u201cdispatched\u201d if it is generating power and exporting it to the grid. Traditional thermal power plants are typically dispatched according to market prices or at the direction of the grid operator. Because renewable energy systems are intermittent or generate power irregularly, they are typically dispatched 100% of the time they are capable of running. Energy storage systems are a relatively new development in the market, and they are often dispatched based on market pricing. The dispatch risk to the generator is when it is able to generate power but cannot do so due to issues outside of its control, such as grid congestion, the local substation being down for maintenance, or a power line being knocked down. During these times, the plant is capable of generating electricity for sale but cannot do so, and this will negatively affect the financial return of the project. To mitigate this risk, some PPAs incorporate provisions that allow for \u201cdeemed\u201d energy, or a calculation of the energy that the generator would have been able to sell and is therefore entitled to receive payment for (also \u201ctake or pay\u201d). These deemed energy payments can be low, so it should be evaluated how an extended dispatch problem would affect the ability of the project to cover its costs. Dispatch risk can also be reduced if there is a proven history of minimal dispatch problems, and an appropriate budget for downtime due to dispatch failures is included in the financial projection. c.\tForce Majeure: A force majeure (FM) event is an extraordinary destructive event completely outside of the control of the offtaker or seller. This can include earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, as well as human events such as war, terrorism, or labor strikes. Because renewable energy assets are long-term assets and the odds of a FM event occurring over a multi-decade timeline is significant, it is important that PPAs have strong FM clauses that relieve the project of responsibilities to perform during a FM event and detail the process to be followed between offtaker and seller during a FM event. Due to COVID-19, many projects have invoked FM due to pandemic-related shipping delays for major equipment, which has delayed project completion. d.\tDispute Resolution: In the event that there is a failure of the offtaker and seller to resolve a problem, PPAs will define how disputes are escalated to another authority. The best solution is for the dispute to be handled via arbitration in a reputable arbitral institute (e.g., AAA, ICC, LCIA). It is problematic if the authority responsible for deciding a dispute has the potential for bias. For example, if disputes are handled by the electricity regulator, there may be a bias toward reducing costs, or if it is handled by a governmental entity that is evaluating a dispute with a government-owned offtaker. e.\tTermination Payments: If the offtaker chooses to terminate the PPA, not due to a failure by the seller to honor their obligations under the PPA, there must be a provision for a substantial termination payment so that the investors (typically at least the lenders) in the project are made whole. The capability of the offtaker to pay a substantial lump-sum termination should be evaluated. This is especially important for projects where alternative offtakers are not available, such as an on-site captive system. Offtakers are strongly motivated to avoid agreeing to a termination payment, and many unbankable PPAs have weak termination provisions, which leave the potential for the investors to have a \u201cstranded asset.\u201d The risk of early termination increases if the tariff is uncompetitive with what the offtaker could get elsewhere in the market. f.\tCollateral Assignment: PPAs should give the lenders to a power project the right to receive any notice of default and the ability to cure such default. Step-in rights, or the ability for lenders to assume the responsibility for satisfying the terms of the PPA, can be negotiated directly between the lenders and the offtaker to further enhance the ability of the lenders to resolve a problem if the sponsor is unable to do so. g.\tInterconnection Risk: The PPA should identify who bears the risk of constructing the transmission line, connecting the project with the grid at the substation, and the upgrades that may be necessary at the substation. If the offtaker needs to construct a substantial transmission line, or if extensive upgrades need to be made at the substation, provisions should be included to protect the project in the event that there is a delay or failure by the offtaker to execute their responsibilities under the PPA. h.\tChange in Law: The PPA should determine who takes the risk of a change to the law or tax regime in a way that will negatively affect the finances of the project. The preference of the financing parties is that the offtaker bears full responsibility, but this is usually only possible with a governmental offtaker, as private entities are mostly unwilling to take this risk. At the very least, a process to be followed in the event of a change in law should be clearly detailed in the PPA. ",
