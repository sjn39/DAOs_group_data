                    "content": "Today we\u2019ll have the first Endgame call in a while. Much has changed in crypto but meanwhile the march towards implementing the Endgame Plan continues.  Link to call (3pm EST/9pm CET):    Zoom Video   Join our Cloud HD Video Meeting Zoom is the leader in modern enterprise video communications, with an easy, reliable cloud platform for video and audio conferencing, chat, and webinars across mobile, desktop, and room systems. Zoom Rooms is the original software-based conference...       Video Recording:       Today\u2019s call will focus on the practical implementation of the governance reform that is central to the Endgame Plan:   Putting in place a near-immutable Endgame Constitution that all Mandated Actors and professional ecosystem participants and official infrastructure must be compliant with.   Bootstrapping the 12 Scope Frameworks that will be the foundational tool for all governance decisions and contain any and all mutable complexity of Maker Governance. Together the 12 Scopes as defined by their Frameworks covers all aspects of Maker Governance and its high level implementation with no gaps or additional   Bootstrapping the DVC concept, starting with 3 launch DVCs that will start to delineate the simple fundamental choices available to MKR holders for determining preferred governance style   Operationalizing the 3 urgent priorities of the Pregame phase    Timeline  Q4 2022: The rest of 2022 will continue with weekly endgame calls for a few more weeks. These calls will be used to discuss the next steps in general, and other general aspects of the implementation of the Endgame Plan over 2023. Ideally the drafts of the Consitution and some of the Scope Frameworks will be published already at this point, to begin the community iteration process  Q1 2023: During this quarter the transition phase will start as the Constitution and Scope Framework drafts are edited and prepared for initial implementation. Decisions related to cleanup of legacy infrastructure, product lines, collateral etc will also be considered. To facilitate the work during this phase we will begin to set up the timeslots for each of the weekly DVC subcommittee calls, so 3 per week in total. However during Q1 they will not be organized as actual DVC subcommittee calls, and will simply be expanded endgame calls that are more focused on operationalization. They will often have to focus on the completion or changes of particular Scope Frameworks. As a part of this process, we will also begin to organically cluster the participants that are closely related to each Scope, including:  MKR Holders/DVC members Delegates Full time specialized Professionals (Council or Tribunal)   Q2 2023: Q2 will begin by (hopefully) passing the first MIP version of the Constitution (a bootstrapping version that is still modifiable) and some or all of the initial Scope Frameworks. With the Constitution passing the DVCs will begin to formally operate as designated in the Endgame Constitution, and each week there will be a meeting for each DVC Subcommittee focusing on the Scope Framework of that particular week. The chronological order of the Scope focus for the 12 weeks of each quarter will be determined based on knowledge gained during Q1 Based on the DVC process the output from the quarter will be new versions of each Scope Frameworks that update them based on the discussion and research done during the quarter, as well as the governance style decisions made based on voter support of each of the 3 (or more) DVCs.  Q3 2023: Going forward every quarter will be a repeat of Q2 with organized and formalized DVC Subcommittee meetings going over each Scope for each of the DVCs, resulting in 3 DVC meetings per week for the 12 weeks of the Quarters, that each take a retrospective look at the Scope Framework, how it was applied to regulate the ecosystem in practice, and what changes that can be made to improve results next quarter. Q3 will focus on preparing the Scope Frameworks for the live environment following the Endgame Plan Launch and the MetaDAO Launches.  Q4 2023: Q4 will hopefully be the first post-launch quarter, where the Scope Frameworks will now be used to regulate and interact with the MetaDAOs in a live environment with voter incentives active. This means that Delegates and DVCs will now run governance in compliance with the constitution and MKR whales will have a significantly diminished ability to influence governance. At this point, the main approach of active governance by MKR voters becomes small modifications of Scope Framework updates based on DVC governance styles, and levying penalties to MetaDAOs.  The 3 urgent priorities In addition to operationalizing all critical elements of the Pregame, including the smart contracts, the MetaDAO frontends, the MetaDAO clustering process and Maker Core governance reform, there are 3 urgent priorities that must be achieved during the Pregame if the Endgame Plan Launch is to be successful:  1) Build community momentum for MetaDAO participation The number one priority during the Pregame phase is to communicate and educate the broader crypto community on the MetaDAOs and their potential, and in especially prepare people for the simple and effective ways that the MetaDAO tokens can be obtained via farming. Getting core communities bootstrapped as early as possible for each of the Launch MetaDAOs is essential in order to ensure a succesful clustering and onboarding of the MetaDAO clusters. MetaDAOs are much more likely to have successful performance and good meta if new commuity members can rely on the experience of existing community members in interacting with the MetaDAO Administration Team and oversee their work and performance.  2) Attract Maker Core RWA talent A key reason why the Endgame Plan and MetaDAOs are needed in the first place is the immense social and political complexity that currently exists in Maker Governance, and in no place is this more concentrated than with Real World Assets. It is vital that the community is able to onboard a RWA Council that can help write and interpret the fundamental rules that will provide an equal and objective playing field for all of the Protectors, allowing us to finally take the drama and uncertainty out of RWA and instead focus on scaling and simplifying.  3) Attract a new generation of professional delegates Delegates play an even more important role in the Endgame because of Voter Incentives which will ensure that a huge amount of currently inactive MKR will become actively delegated, mostly to the Recognized Delegates. This puts a huge amount of responsibility on them, and also concentrates risk around them. We already have experienced delegates today, but it is important that we promote diversification of delegates and also attract new delegates that can specialize in areas of the Scopes where we currently lack expertise, and overall force an upleveling of the delegate role - accompanied by a significant increase in compensation and responsibilites that will put top delegates on par with mandated actors.
