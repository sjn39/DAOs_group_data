What if some mechanism will print DAI when is big demand and peg is more than 1 and buy DAI and burn it when is bellow 1? I was bit studining OHM mechanism where smart contract is erasing trust to entity which is buying and selling, beacuase it is doing automatically with preprogrammed conditions. This can also works for DAI. If DAI > 1 than smart contract would prind DAI and sell it for ETH and hodl ETH. If DAI is < 1 than SC will sell ETH for DAI and hodl or burn. What do you think about this idea? ",

                    "content": "There is potentially a solution here. Currently the PSM provides two key benefits - efficiency (1:1), and stability, particularly when DAI >$1. In theory, Maker could pass governance that only allows the PSM to issue new DAI to 3rd parties when the total amount of USDC is <x% of DAI outstanding (let\u2019s say 10%, so ~$700m vs. ~$3.5bn today). This would turn the PSM into a one-way valve (only helping with stability when DAI <$1) until the reliance on USDC drops meaningfully. Simultaneously, if/when DAI >$1, Maker can self-arb, minting DAI and selling it for USDC (or perhaps 3-pool). The profits from this arb are then used to buy ETH. If ETH goes to $0, DAI is still fully collateralized and stability remains. The real benefit is what happens when ETH doesn\u2019t go to $0, or even goes up? Maker can use it as collateral, minting DAI against it as another valve if DAI >$1, and buying back to repay DAI if DAI <$1. If ETH drops meaningfully, it will be liquidated just like any other vault. Maker\u2019s ETH can have special liquidation terms (risk-averse?) and fees (0%). Over time, assuming Maker is never liquidated, the ETH reserve will continue to grow. ",

                    "content": "Although I agree with your answer I think it is quite binary, with no offense. I mean I am 99% sure that ETH will not drop from $4k to $1k in next 2 blocks which means we must calculate with much more options than 0 and 1. For example last 18% drop last 46 hours which is 13000+ Ethereum blocks, plenty space for some smart job. It is like with nuclear power plant. 0 = turn off, 1 = explosion but in reality we are working between 0 and 1. With good management and regulations etc I think there can be some chance to find reasonable solution. Also important is how scalability DAI needs? I think we dont need infinity scalability (this would be like perpetuum mobile). Now my theory: If Ethereum has blocks every millisecond, than smart contract can sell and buy ETH / DAI how is needed. If DAI for example = 1.02 than sc can print DAI buy ETH and immediately is in 2% profit. This profit can be used in future like buffer. If ETH price go down than sc can sell part of ETH for DAI and hold it like reserves. In millisecond block it would be still ~2% profit. If ETH goes up it can buy it back for that DAI. Also there are 13% liquidation penalties which can be in favor of sc. sc would be first who can take it. With these penalties we can make bigger buffer which can be useful because Ethereum blocks are not in milliseconds. I know this is not perfect concept with everything, but I think there is a way and we can find it. ",
