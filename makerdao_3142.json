Currently I am struggling to understand how the total debt of the system is calculated. So far I am:  Getting a list of ilk types by calling ilkRegistry.list [ETH-A, ETH-B, BAT-A]  For each ilk type, retrieving the ilk with val.ilks(ilkType) and calculating the amount of generated dai from that ilk with ilk.art * ilk.rate. The result of this seems to be correct when compared to daistats.com. Sum the generated Dai for all ilks.  At time of writing, the sum in step three is returning 1,414,371,853.86 while vat.dai is returning 1,420,115,977.85. What variables am I missing? Thanks! ",
