                    "content": "With the fixed rate market 25X larger than the variable rate market, I\u2019ve been thinking maybe we should be putting more attention into exploring the opportunity to have a new ETH collateral type that offers a Stability Fee cap to increase Dai supply. Aave has both a variable and fixed rate giving the user options to choose from when taking a loan. For example, Aave\u2019s current Dai rates are: Variable: 5.99% Stable/Fixed: 7.78% My understanding is the current Stability Fee structure is: Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + Risk Premium, 0%) where the SF > or = 0%. We could potentially add a new collateral type that would receive an added max SF rate parameter. I\u2019m interested to get some feedback about the idea. Is a New ETH Collateral Type with a Stability Fee Cap a good idea?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     If Yes, what should be the Max Stability Fee Rate? (%)     1 2 3 4 5 6 Abstain     0 voters     If Yes, what should be the Initial Debt Ceiling? (in Million)     1 2 5 10 Abstain     0 voters     ",
