                    "content": "Hey all, We are releasing the second batch of proposed DC-IAM parameters for smaller vault types. Both \u2018gap\u2018 and \u2018ttl\u2019 values below are based on the same decision making process and intuition that we already described when proposing these parameters for ETH-A, whereas \u2018line\u2019 values are based on our risk premium table. This time we aren\u2019t polling for \u2018line\u2019 parameter, since these vault types are having very limited usage (only 5m DAI debt from these 7 vaults in aggregate). This proposal also concludes our planned DC-IAM implementation proposals for \u201cvanilla collaterals\u201d. We should propose DC-IAM parameters for UNI LPs in the coming weeks or when oracle audit is confirmed. We should propose a higher \u2018line\u2019, yet still a bit conservative, since we aren\u2019t convinced the keeper ecosystem around UNI LP auctions is currently healthy. Remaining vault types where DC-IAM could be implemented are stablecoin vaults and PSM, however we do not suggest using it since we do not want to risk DAI liquidity squeeze. In other words, \u2018gap\u2019 for stablecoin vaults or PSM would need to be very high and IAM DC implementation becomes trivial.

My reasoning for this is as follows:  Gas prices make deploying and voting in polls relatively expensive. Probably not contentious - This batch mostly contains the lesser-used set of vault types. No one is voting against in this signal. Even without these, there are 16 polls set to go out on Monday. Some might argue that that is excessive.  ",
