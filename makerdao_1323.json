This is not a rage quit, but simply a step down to focus 100% of my available time at writing my own whitepaper.   In the past 30-35 years I have spent probably 10\u2019s of thousands of hours donating my time to intentional communities, co-ops, open-source projects (yes I was a coder once long ago), and now DAOs seeking a better way to conduct an \u2018enterprise\u2019.   I have learned a lot about governance, people, money, power, law and complex systems to believe I have a set of solutions to many of the problems we see \u2018with equitable and fair treatment\u2019 of all stakeholders conducting enterprise.  Blockchain was the key component to the solution.  What has been created on Ethereum I believe has all the core elements to make a better world (both from a financial perspective, but also from a governance and people one).    I have been working on these pieces, some of which I have already written about and proposed, some which I have not. I want to thank those who supported me in the past, and hope may find interest in supporting a vision I have for the future. I wish all the relevant stakeholders at Maker the best. I will continue to vote, and carry out delegate functions, but should those delegating to me see fit to find another delegate before my contract ends I won\u2019t feel slighted in the least. Sincerely, MakerMan ",
