                    "content": "TL;DR: Flags are there for a reason, if you would like comments and accounts examined please flag content you believe to violate our policies.  Forum Management Hello, over the past week GovAlpha has received several inquiries about new accounts on the forum, suspected sock puppet accounts, and general interest in our moderation technique for the forums. While @LongForWisdom and myself are not the only Moderators on the forum, we do tend to process a majority of flagged content.  Philosophy In general, we lean toward taking no action on posts we come across unless something is overtly against policies and expected behaviors. However, anyone on the forum has the ability to \u201cflag\u201d posts (dms and public comments) they feel should be examined as potentially hazardous for the community. When a post is flagged, it forces the moderators of the forum to accept or decline the flag, taking away a decent chunk of our bias toward inaction. In regards to banning accounts (particularly accounts that community members suspect are alt accounts of recognized community members), GovAlpha does not want to be put in the position of determining legitimacy. Instead, we rely on community flags to notice continual behavior against our standards and take escalating action against offenders. If the community would like to see this policy changed, we will need a clear signal from the community that GovAlpha should be stepping in when suspected alternate accounts pop.  Risks to More Aggressive Moderation There are several dangers to walking down that path, and as a protocol designed to be censorship-resistant, we should take policing of who and what can be posted as a very serious topic. However, those concerns must be balanced against the safety and effectiveness of our community, as failure to weed out \u201cbad actors\u201d could result in the forum not being a suitable host for decentralized governance. In order to remain decentralized we need to keep our discourse open and accessible, the more power we give to moderators, the greater the chance that power is abused.  Community Considerations Here are a list of questions we must ask ourselves as moderators and what (I hope) might be helpful framing for anyone that would like to pitch a stronger-handed approach to forum moderation:  Should accounts that make attempts to obscure their speech patterns (using specific vernacular, \u201cbroken\u201d English, or other formulaic tools) be treated with greater suspicion? To what extent is it the moderator\u2019s job to \u201ctone police\u201d criticism in an effort to promote healthy dialogue? Should anonymous/pseudononymous authors be treated the same as known members of the community? What is the appropriate escalation of moderation? When should accounts be banned, if ever? Who should have the power to moderate these discussions and how should their work be evaluated? Are there steps/procedures we can implement to limit spam and encourage more discussion on governance proposals?   Feedback and Next Steps What do you think, anon? Is our Moderation philosophy in need of a refresh? We have considered running an informal poll about community feelings toward moderation. Ideally, someone would be interested in crafting policy for moderation across platforms which we would be happy to contribute to, but we first must discuss the ideas and trade-offs before attempting to craft policy. Based on how this post is received we will see what will be the most effective way to get the answers to the questions presented here. ",

That is a greater concern to me, but there are a few minor ones like what about accounts for groups that wish to communicate as a single entity, and what risks we\u2019d be creating around a potential secondary market for verified forum accounts. In general I think it\u2019s better to plan for ways that moderators can take actions currently available to them in a more unified and directed fashion, but if the community feels strongly that mechanisms like Proof of Humanity should be investigated we would probably be the CU to do so, and have the labor force to make that happen.
