Paragraph Summary The Maker Portfolio Core Unit (MPCU) will be tasked with onboarding partnered legal entities that can provide the Maker Protocol with exposure to securities of its choice. The MPCU\u2019s role is to find and implement workarounds for Maker\u2019s inability to join legal agreements or pass KYC requirements of counterparties. The MPCU\u2019s priorities will be to safely scale upwards the supply of DAI, lock in long-term and predictable revenues for the protocol, and generate goodwill through a substantial charitable giving component to minimize tax payments.  Core Unit Name Maker Portfolio Core Unit (MPCU)  Motivation I see Maker as unique in terms of both its potential and its capabilities. I want to see the protocol grow into a leading role in guiding and stabilizing the world economy, while also growing profitability for MKR holders. To achieve both of these goals, the Maker Protocol needs to scale much larger. Safely adding to DAI circulation, providing positive-yield real-world collateral, and minimizing risk of both capital losses and disruption to DAI\u2019s USD peg are always top of my mind. My track record with personal, family, and business finances is one of searching for low-risk opportunities that can still yield large returns. Those familiar with my activities within the Maker community also know me as an advocate of strong cost controls, systemic risk management, and continuous marginal improvement. The MPCU is a perfect fit for my skillset, as I help Maker grow a low-risk income source that can be used to rapidly scale supply of DAI, provide higher quality collateral than the protocol currently has access to, and grants some level of stability in earnings to properly cover operational expenses.  Facilitator Name and Information Name: Chris Cameron Forum:@PaperImperium R/C: @PaperImperium ETH Address: TBD  Facilitator Credentials   More than 12 years of securities investing experience in personal and family accounts, with annualized returns (before tax, after other expenses) of ~20%.   Former general partner of a small investing LP for family members\u2019 assets.   A founding member of the Maker RWA Committee.   Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Economics from UNC-Chapel Hill.
