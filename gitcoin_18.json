                    "content": "I think there is so much potential in investing data science at Gitcoin. This is informed by a few things   Prior Experience. A few years ago, I was the Director of Engineering at a clean energy startup that set up a fairly robust data warehouse ETL/snowflake schema system to run advanced analytics on time series data.  I\u2019ve also been in a few different product oriented positions at various web2 startups that had mission critical ecommerce checkout flows with A/B testing, marketing emails to optimize those funnels.  This one time, when i was CTO of an online dating site (a double sided marketplace, just like Gitcoin), I built a matching engine that matched users on 20 dimensions. Per gitcoin.co/results, Gitcoin has helped 66,712 funders reach an audience of 292,817 earners. Gitcoin has facilitated 1,740,075 complete transactions to 10,247 unique earners.  Understanding the 4 years of data at Gitcoin, particularly the Grants Rounds data, gives me a hunch that there are interesting opportunities in understanding the data.  The objective of this thread is to start a conversation. What should the data science practice at Gitcoin look like? Here are the data science opportunities matters I\u2019m aware of at GitcoinDAO   Product Analytics &  Data Science  Responsible for understanding how users use the platfrom.    Marketing Analytics & Data Science  Responsible for understanding how to drive more core actions (like Grants checkouts)    Complex Systems Insights  Responsible for guiding the QF matching engine with deep analytical insights (perhaps one day even simulating agent-based contributor behaviour) Responsible for  publishing advanced analytics-based insights from our datasets.  Heres an example of what this could look like.     Fraud insights  Responsible for (Joe, correct me if I\u2019m wrong) surfacing fraud on the Gitcoin Grants network (whether sybil or collusion) and partnering with Governance to remediate in a legitimate way.    An assortment of tools are used in these practices at Gitcoin.  Here are the ones I\u2019m aware of:  Etherscan Dune Analytics The Graph PostgresSQL Google Analytics Metabase Google spreadsheets Google presentations Acquia CADCAD Machine Learning Tools (not sure which ones)  I\u2019d welcome corrections from any workstream leads on the above.  The above is just my best approximation of the tools/roles as they currently stand int he DAO. I\u2019d be curious if people in the community would be interested in putting forward a proposal to the DAO to formalize a data science practice at GitcoinDAO (which currently resides in multiple different groups at varying levels of coordination) I\u2019d like to end on this questions:  What should the data science practice at Gitcoin look like? If Data Science was an area of practice at Gitcoin, what would it look like? How could it span multiple workstreams or squads(teams) & cross-pollinate between them?

And just as you say, more cross-pollination between ppl that do data currently could have great benefit to improve our products. Data that I use day to day include; Traffic data Grants performance (add to carts, checkouts) Mobile performance Monitoring traffic sources Campaign monitoring (newsletters etc) A powerful link would be data to be set in comparison with grants data from Metabase to compare and identify new opportunities for growth. How do we structure all this? Maybe;  A data scientist who can identify interesting data and create datasets based on our grants data, and do all the queries. A google analytics (or similar tool) wizard who monitors user behavior and run A/B tests to continually improve our product. A product manager. 1 and 2 should work closely with the PM to understand their product better and identify pain points in the funnel and where there is potential to improve.  One pitfall we could encounter is to create fantastic datasets and insights, but no idea how we can execute on the data. Identifying the right stakeholders and making everyone onboard will be important for the project\u2019s success. This also needs to align with the Web 3.0 ethos to collect as little data as possible to be able to do our job. I think transparency and inclusion of the GitcoinDAO would be crucial to be able to do this well. ",

In my mind, #1 should be a data-focused product team with the remit to build a scalable data warehouse/system that can make data more easily available to analyst-level data users. In other words, how do we knit all of our data sources together and let SQL users get value out of it (given they have the business context)? #2 feels like building a group of analysts and scientists (i.e. more advanced data users) that can be embedded on specific workstreams.

                    "content": "@ivanmolto  and I have been looking into the correlation between GTC outflow from GitcoinDAO and GTC spot price. A common belief is that Workstreams compensating contributors with GTC would somehow negatively impact the price of GTC. We put this theory to the test through a number of queries in this Dune Dashboard to see if it holds any water. In order to produce a meaningful analysis we couldn\u2019t just track GTC outflow from Workstreams and compare that to GTC price. To accurately test this hypothesis we need to take one step further and track GTC outflow from contributors in relation to price. A common conception about contributors receiving compensation in GTC is that they will immediately sell their tokens for other assets, causing a massive sell wall and negative price movement as a result. After analyzing 269 unique contributors over time we can see that this is far from the truth. The data show that contributors of GitcoinDAO are likely to hold their GTC and the average amount of GTC held by this group is increasing. The first figure below shows the number of contributors who hold more than 0, 100 and 1000 GTC respectively. The second figure displays the amount of GTC held (x100) in total by this group as well as their average GTC holdings. These metrics are all increasing.  1600\u00d71120 203 KB  We could not find a correlation between GTC outflow from Workstreams and GTC price movement:  1600\u00d7464 99.8 KB  As we looked further into what could impact GTC we found a correlation between GTC and other governance tokens. In general, GTC seems to be following the movements of the market sector. The figure below show the price movement of other governance tokens and GTC, relative to their price on May 25th 2021:  1430\u00d7445 84.3 KB  In conclusion; the hypothesis that sending GTC to Workstreams who then pay contributors would negatively impact GTC price can not be proven through the data. GTC is however correlated to similar tokens in the sector. We encourage you all to look through the dashboard and we welcome feedback on ways to improve these further. A couple of additional visuals and tweaks will be added to the dashboard in the coming days. Enormous shoutout to @ivanmolto for the amazing job.

It\u2019s easy to make assumptions yet we must always keep ourselves in check to ensure governance decisions are not made emotionally but rather objectively and from a fully informed place of intention. When we were discussing this and even though I had an inkling the contributor sell could not affect things as much, I really did not grasp just how much hodling was actually going on. The same with the pattern of other gov tokens which is why I made the suggestion to add that chart in order to give place this analysis against the broader market background. I am keen to see these analyses progress and become a tool in the gov process. Perhaps, something we look to include in the improved versions of workstream accountability flow or in any voter matrix we may choose to adopt - provided they achieve balance between objectivity and personal takes.

This has proven to be harder than we anticipated, however we are now able to track sales from contributor addresses across all of the major CEXs which has been a big milestone.     myceliumcoordinator:  The inverse is also true! This analysis does not show that selling tokens to market DOES not create downward price.       myceliumcoordinator:  How can you draw that conclusion from that graph? You just showed a bunch of data that has a bunch of outflows and a large decline in price. There\u2019s no rigor to this analysis method. There\u2019s no control group, nor is there any analysis of the liquidity of the market in this analysis.   I think you misunderstood my previous post; we could not find a correlation with our current data and methodology. Not being able to prove a hypothesis does not necessarily mean that the opposite is true. Circling back to sell pressure from contributors; We\u2019ve recently added a graph over relative GTC price vs daily total contributor sales (DEX+CEX). (A correlation analysis has not yet been initiatied at this point):  bild1488\u00d7516 53.9 KB  Even though we are now able to track contributor sales on CEXs we\u2019ve yet to find a way to get accurate total CEX volume into the dashboard. Until we have this data available natively in Dune I\u2019ve grabbed the daily volume (CEX+DEX) from Coinmarketcap and Coingecko and plotted this graph:  790\u00d7602 56.9 KB  The volume has stayed between 1M - 10M GTC per day for the majority of GTC\u2019s history. Median GTC volume according to Coinmarketcap = 2.7M GTC/day. Median GTC volume according to Coingecko = 2M GTC/day. This is the graph of total GTC sales from contributors on DEX & CEX:  bild1656\u00d7455 58.6 KB  Even on days of relatively large GTC sales from contributors, 10k GTC/day, contributor sell pressure is still less than half a percent of the median daily volume. (10k GTC/day is roughly equivalent to the 90-95th percentile. A normal distribution graph of contributor sell pressure is in the works. This will allow you to grab any percentile of contributor sell pressure and compare that to the total daily volume.)     myceliumcoordinator:  GTC is down 50% vs ETH over the last 30 days, so I dont think you can say the outflows are in line with the rest of the market decline.   I think you\u2019ve misunderstood the governance token part of the dashboard as well. We are comparing GTC to other governance tokens, which are all down vs ETH. For convenience we\u2019ve now grouped together other governance tokens into a basket on the graph. Although we haven\u2019t initiated a proper correlation analysis to define the strength of the association, a correlation is clear:  bild1481\u00d7515 51.6 KB      myceliumcoordinator:  I think doing an analysis about this could be important, but more rigor is needed to be able to form conclusions backed by data in my opinion.   As stated earlier, the dashboard will receive continuous updates as we are able to track more data. I\u2019d be happy to continue the conversation and discuss things further if you are interested in helping out! (Please note that Dune is performing internal upgrades at the moment and some graphs will not load properly until this work has been completed. The dashboard may also be slower to load) ",
