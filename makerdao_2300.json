It is a lot of information to sort through, so take it in small pieces if that will help you to focus and retain the information. Here is a link to an indexed list of all the MIPS (outside the forum). It is the entire framework of an introductory governance framework and collateral on-boarding procedures. You will find the MIP number, title, and sentence summary with a link to the forum discussion. See below for two additional sub-proposals added to MIPS 0 through 12.   The state of the peg has caused concern within and without the MakerDAO community. Some of the larger Maker holders stepped forward and posted their concerns around the state of the peg directly in the Maker forum. This spurred a lot of momentum in the platform, discussed further in this issue.   Intention to implementation. The DAO is getting very busy, and thought needs to be given to determining the feasibility of proposals, getting buy-in, and recruiting the appropriate skill sets in the community. Timing is key. The DAO is in need of a project management framework that is effortless and easily integrated into the current systems.   Dispositioned Governance Agenda New   LongForWisdom is proposed, second governance facilitator. He said \u201cYes!\u201d.   Wrapped BTC has been proposed for collateral on-boarding.   USDC Risk parameter adjustment and on-boarding additional stable coins such as PAX and TUSD.   On-boarding LINK as a new collateral type.   Self-sustaining DAO: MIPS 0 - 12 - Ratification timeline and two additional sub-proposals have been shared in the forum.   System Reserves - Deciding a prudent reserve amount of DAI for emergency events. A forum poll is now open.   Moving   Urgent - State of the Peg - Getting DAI back on soft-peg to a Dollar after it has been trading high following black Thursday.   SCD shutdown going to Executive Vote on April 24, 2020, three-week delay to follow for a final shutdown date of May 12, 2020.   Zero bid auction post mortem data evaluation - Maker Man currently completing the data analytics from black Thursday. This part is moving behind the scenes. A report is forthcoming in the next several weeks.   Public relations consortium - Communication team to create consistent and representative communications on behalf of the DAO and to report meaningful ecosystem sentiment back to the governance community. The team has been having weekly meetings, a first report is due by the end of the month.   Stalled   Governance vote cadence - the timing for which executive voting happened for certain parameters. This may be overridden by the MIPS governance cycle.   Compensating Zero Bid Vault Owners. The poll was affirmative to compensate vault holders. Currently waiting on data analytics from Maker Man before restarting in another thread.   DeFi Emergency shutdown consortium   Dark fix - \"   Flip / Flop auction usability   Maker token authority   Precedent for on-chain polling. Signaling started to determine the governance community\u2019s feelings about having foundation member proposals require on-chain polling. The forum thread seems to have died.   Completed   GSM delay - raise the delay from 4 hours to 12 hours for enacting Executive Votes, as a safety precaution.- Ratified   Ranked-choice polling   MKR Debt Auctions - Completed successfully   USDC On-boarding   Deep dive into collateral on-boarding - Presentation to community completed, see forum for the movement   Governance cycle: MIPS 3 Presented in G and R Call - Presentation completed, see forum for the movement   DAI Digits   DAI Peg: 7d Low / 7d High $1.010 / $1.020   DAI Statistics   Governance Dashboard   Governance Polls and Executive Votes Passed on April 20, 2020: Executive Vote Adjust the USDC, Sai and Dai Stability Fees   Lower the USDC Stability Fee from 12% to 8%   Raise the Sai Stability Fee from 8% to 8.5%   Lower the Dai Stability Fee from 0.5% to 0%   Note: This will set the DSR to 0%   Passed on April 25, 2020: Executive Vote Lower USDC SF, Lower USDC LR, Whitelist Oracles, Raise Dai DC, Raise GSM Delay, Deactivate MKR Oracle in SCD   Lower the USDC Stability Fee from 8% to 6%   Lower the USDC Liquidation Ratio from 125% to 120%   Whitelist Set Protocol on ETH/USD Oracle   Create BTC/USD Oracle + Whitelist Set Protocol and dYdX   Create ETH/BTC Oracle + Whitelist tBTC   Deactivate the MKR Oracle in SCD   Raise the Governance Security Module delay from 4 hours to 12 hours   Raise the DAI Debt Ceiling from 90 Million to 100 Million   All recent polls are closed and represented in the most recent Executive Vote. Further information can be found here. Governance Hot Topics State of the Peg Since the Black Thursday event of March 12, 2020, DAI has consistently been trading above the one Dollar price soft-peg it is supposed to maintain. Sometimes grossly over peg by over ten cents. In recent weeks it has been slowly trending back to a Dollar but has not quite gotten there. Confidence has not yet fully returned regarding the recent market volatility. Also, people are holding on to stable coins due to market fears. This has caused a serious lack of DAI liquidity, creating high demand, and affecting the peg. Prices this last week ranged from one to two cents above peg. Paraficapital, a larger corporate Maker holder in the governance community posted their concerns in the forum and related the sentiment of worry in the ecosystem regarding DAI being off the peg. This brought about immediate discussion and action regarding monetary policy and collateral on-boarding. The most recent passed Executive Vote contains monetary policy to make minting DAI more lucrative from USDC. Also, some exciting new collateral types are being considered for use in the MakerDAO platform. More on that next\u2026 WBTC as a new collateral type? WBTC also is known as wrapped Bitcoin is currently being evaluated by the Maker governance community to be on-boarded as approved vault collateral. Wrapped Bitcoin is Bitcoin that is held by the WBTC DAO and then tokenized 1:1 on the Ethereum (ERC-20) blockchain. Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain you ask!? It\u2019s already here, you can trade it on the https://Oasis.app . Many players in the DeFi ecosystem are excited about this step. Bitcoin is the most popular and most valuable cryptocurrency. While there is a small amount of WBTC use on current DeFi platforms, it was stated that people have been waiting for Maker to adopt WBTC as a collateral type. It was also said that using WBTC as ERC-20 collateral is the primary use case for ERC-20 Bitcoin. Forum links are listed below for this subject. Other Collateral Considerations In addition to WBTC, LINK is being considered for on-boarding as approved vault collateral as well as additional stable coins such as PAX and TUSD. All of these collateral options are hoped to help bring back sufficient DAI liquidity and help return the DAI price peg to exactly one Dollar. Again, see below for the forum links regarding these new collateral types. MIPS 0 - 12 Due for Initial Polling; if Passed Moving on to Executive Vote MIPS 0 through 12 has been a high focus subject in the governance community for the last few weeks. These are the first documents that spell out a governance and collateral on-boarding framework for a self-sufficient DAO. This is the beginning of the two to three-year process of handing full control of MakerDAO to the governance community and dissolving the foundation. The very nice flow chart below shows the two possible scenarios for approval or rejection of these MIPS in the Timing Governance Poll. Forum links can be found below for further information.  MIP Implementation Timeline638\u00d71252 104 KB  SCD Shutdown Single Collateral DAI shutdown is very close. An Executive Vote for shutting down SCD is supposed to be posted on or shortly after April 24, 2020. There will then be a 3-week delay for shutting down. This will give time for people to close out their vaults, and hopefully drain the migration contract. Stability fees are going to be set to zero to incentivize the closing of vaults. If you are still holding SAI as of the time it shuts down, you should be able to redeem your SAI for ETH via the migration portal at https://migrate.makerdao.com Forum Activity and Signaling MakerDAO Community and Governance/Risk Forums Trending Issues in the Forum:   Action Required: State of the Peg   [WBTC] - WBTC Collateral Request For Comment   The Ratification Timeline for the Initial 13 Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPS) and 2 Subproposals   DAI:ETH UNI-V1 Oracle Discussion   Sequential Process for SCD Shutdown   Proposal BTCUSD Oracle (Set Protocol, dYdX)   Should we increase the ETH-A debt ceiling by $10 million in the executive vote on 24/04/20?

                    "content": "Hi, I would like to give my experience as a ETH holder because I think It could be potentially valuable hindsight on some of the dynamics at plays in DAI generation. I see the vault  and DAI generation in general as a way to make my ETH holdings work. This means that I always have the maximum amount of DAI out that allows me to sleep without fearing a liquidation during the night. Personally I am comfortable if a 25% drop stays above my liquidation point. This means a ratio of 150/0.75=200% and I can take out about 0.5 of my total ETH locked in DAI. On compound the ratio I get is 135/0.75=180% so that I can take out  0.555 of my total ETH locked in DAI. In other words I can take out about 11% more DAI on compound. Often the spread in interest rates is low enough to make those 11% worth it and I end up borrowing from compound instead. For example with a spread of 1.5% or less it\u2019s a no-brainer if you know where to put your DAI. If the vault minimum collaterization ratio goes to 140% or less this would probably never be the case that I prefer borrowing on compound. Of course one could argue that people would then be less incentivized to generate DAI to lend on compound but I feel that at least on the short term this would lead to real boost in DAI generation.
