People liked it (just some bike-shedding around the naming) - but I am not sure about how to roll this change out - this was also the reason I did not proceed with it.

A browsable version of all current and draft EIPs can be found on [the official EIP site](http://eips.ethereum.org/).  # Standards and Specifications  Aside from improving and upgrading the Ethereum platform, the goal of the EIP process is to document the standards and specifications that define it. Following these specifications, an implementation team should be able to build interoperable components that connect to the Ethereum main net, various test nets, and other layers of the Ethereum network.  The list of Ethereum components is as follows. Each component may have a different process for maintenance and updates, but will create or update EIPs to reflect changes.  <!-- EDITORS / MAINTAINERS for each of the below -->  * formal specification https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper <!-- TO BE REPLACED with Jello Paper --> * devp2p https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%C3%90%CE%9EVp2p-Wire-Protocol * Light Ethereum Subprotocol https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Light-client-protocol * whisper https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-Overview * swarm https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/2959 * API/RPC https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC * contract ABIs https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI     This file has been truncated. show original      I\u2019m up for discussing and helping with this.
