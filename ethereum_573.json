Friday will be the Ethereum Meetup Berlin so we could also do some small pop up sessions in this context. To both occasions I will bring these stickers:  ethmagicians.jpg4000\u00d72250 3.14 MB  If you want some just ask. And if you are going to ETHDenver it would be great if you could take a batch of them to pass them on to @c-o-l-o-r ",

IANAL but for...        @rmeissner let me know if i forgot something or got anything wrong - I also forgot one thing that I had on the agenda in my mind - I think \" Possible Future Methods\" should be removed from the EIP - let\u2019s discuss these outside the EIP scope and create an EIP with them when the time is ripe. With the wallet_version call we should have a clear upgrade path for this in the future. ",
