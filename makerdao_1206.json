However, the amount of DAI at risk for governance would be the daily limit (in case governance can trigger the circuit breaker within 24h), and we need to discuss whether this is acceptable or not   We have a discussion setup with PECU next week to decide on next step for circuit breakers across rollups: who can trigger the circuit breaker? Is it acceptable to have the daily limit at risk?   Starknet will maintain Starknet alpha, but deploy a new version with a fresh start. The main motivation for Regenesis is capitalizing on the new possibilities brought about by Cairo 1.0 \u2014 namely sequencers DOS protection, censorship resistance and gas metering, which are essential for StarkNet as a decentralized network (see full article)   In the September update, we laid out the two options for the migration: Starknet-operateed migration vs. our own migration  Starknet-operated migration: Starkware takes control but it does not require users to do anything, and contract addresses stay the same Our own migration: we would require users to burn the old DAI and then mint the new DAI. All the existing liquidity pools (two of them) listing DAI will have to be shut down and launched    After discussions with the Starkware team in Lisbon, we decided to go for the Starknet-operated migration for its obvious benefits. It does bear the risk of Starkware being malicious. For this reason, we will not increase the bridge limit until the migration is finished     On simple bridge  Spell to add the Starknet fees to the operational bridge contracts has been executed on 2022-10-26 (link to explainer) Spell to add the Starknet fees to GovRelay has been crafted and handed over to PECU. To be executed the week of Nov 29 (link to explainer)    On fast withdrawals deployment  Fast withdrawal contract are finalized and audited (audit report) Fast withdrawal spell to testnet has been executed Fast withdrawal spell to mainnet to be executed on the week of nov 29 Oracle CU has the staging oracles working with the testnet contracts Oracle CU to complete the production oracles by December 10 and seek quorum approval by December 15 We are planning on having fast withdrawals fully ready on mainnet by mid-December The debt ceiling will then be set in a spell early January The front-end integration with Starkgate will be optimistically done in December, pessimistically in January    On teleport development   The contracts are currently work in progress and not final until we can run integrated tests, which we have a dependency with PECU with. Our goal is to be able to run integrated tests in Q1. After integrated tests, we will have all the contracts below audited.   Dai contract: contract developed, tests developed   DaiJoin: contract developed, tests developed   Vat: contract developed, tests developed   TeleportConstantFee: contract developed, tests developed   TeleportJoin: contract developed, tests developed   TeleportOracleAuth: contract developed, tests developed   TeleportRouter: contract developed, tests developed   Cure: developed, tests developed   End: developed, tests developed   Spotter, pot, jug: developed, tests in development - those contracts are not needed for teleport but will be needed for MCD   On budget  Our current balance is DAI 196k. Our burn in the next months will be roughly DAI 35 - 45k depending on audit costs We will submit a budget proposal once the MIP process is back in March We might have to ask for small DAI 10k - 30k ad hoc buget before depending on audit costs    ",

It is a trace of a transaction executed via account abstraction that initiates withdrawal on the starknet DAI bridge. It consists of two operations:  increaseAllowance initiate_withdrawal  From the point of view of the user it is a single atomic operation that needs to be signed once. ",

This protocol has been elaborated by SECU and validated by Starknet Prepared a draft of an emergency protocol for circuit breaker action (simple bridge), to be discussed in Paris with PECU Discussed the design for a fast withdrawal circuit breaker that would prevent users from minting on target domain in case of emergency. This circuit breaker would also bypass the two days governance delay    On the simple bridge  Released the mainnet version of the bridge. Also released a UI in collaboration with Starkware.

We are considering before year-end and increase to 1-2Mn DAI bridge limit Discussions about circuit breakers: we have considered multiple options in our latest post. However, we are yet to discuss with Starknet CU and PE whether a governance-triggered circuit breaker is even acceptable from a market and regulatory risk standpoint. If not, a permissionless design would be the only path. In case we choose to build a permissionless circuit breaker, we have been holding sessions with relevant technical partners (e.g., Empiric Network, Herodotus, Fossil)    On the upgrade of the simple bridge  We have updated our contracts to include the Starknet fee mechanism. Contracts have been audited (link to report) and will be deployed around Oct 23    On fast withdrawals deployment  Fast withdrawal contract are finalized and audited (audit report) Contracts are planned to be deployed on Goerli, then Mainnet the first week of November Oracle team will then deploy on staging/testnet, prod/testnet, prod/mainnet the oracles.

However, given the delays incurred while the development of phase I and II, we decided to not scale the team as originally planned. We currently have enough funding until end of August and will submit for budget extension then. On Risk Management  Developed with PECU a fast withdrawal risk assessment and recommendation for the Risk CU. To be published in the next few days Developed an emergency management protocol to allow fast action in case of a hack where some users lose their funds. We focused on rapid planning for communication and potential mitigations, and we focused on defining the role of Maker and the role of the rollup. To be discussed with PECU and Governance Prepared the spell to increase the simple bridge limit from DAI 100k to DAI 200k We will increase the bridge limit based on the limits of other Starknet bridges as well as Maker governance approval  On the simple bridge  Released the mainnet version of the bridge. Also released a UI in collaboration with Starkware. See Starkgate UI  Reached the bridge limit of DAI 100k. The bridge limit will be doubled to DAI 200k on June 8  On fast withdrawals  Developed an end-to-end PoC for fast withdrawals on Goerli Handed over the oracle PoC to the oracles team  On teleportation  Planning the development of vat on Starknet Preparing for the retreat with PECU to plan the technical implementation of teleportation  ",

To be discussed with PECU and Governance   I saw a lot of end-users on the StarkWare Discord wondering what happened to their DAI (and ETH) transfers. Some were delayed because going backwards (StarkNet \u2014> Ethereum) on StarkGate takes approximately 7 or more hours. With that in mind, do you plan of hiring more people to help mitigate confused end-users questions and possibly unhappiness about their bridge experience? Or will this be a collab were StarkWare will also provide the Human Resources?     pyramidmaker:  Also released a UI in collaboration with Starkware.   Just to make sure I understand this correctly, you\u2019ll design a new UX/UI similar to StarKGate  but this one will belong to MakerDAO? Is that right  ",

To be clear, the document you are referencing above is only for cases when users actually lose their funds. We are not planning on recruiting anyone else until we have a full understanding of what that person would do, but as we are scaling the bridge it would make a lot of sense. The fact that a withdrawal takes several hours is a hard fact that we could make clearer in the interface. But it will be solved once we have fast withdrawals up and running, you could just select the fast path in the interface. For now, we are simply integrating to Starkgate, which is developed and owned by Starkware. In my opinion we should have a teleport interface consolidating all the DAI bridges, but views are very divergent within the DAO on this. ",
