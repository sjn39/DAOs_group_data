Thank you for bringing that up @Mamun. @MarianoDP May I ask if this is something that\u2019s being considered for the website revamp? Providing a brief comparison of available frontends/apps for managing Maker Vaults would certainly be much fairer to all teams that\u2019ve been building on MakerDAO and providing different additional features and services. Liquity\u2019s approach, for example, is much fairer, although still a bit lacking in good information for decision making. ",
