As you may know, the EthCC Conference is our tradition where the first Ethereum Magicians in person Council was hosted. I think it would be nice to get the Magicians OG\u2019s and host a Council, discussion about Ethereum, EIPs\u2026 Due to the COVID situation being all over the place, I\u2019m wondering how many of the Magicians, and the OG Magicians are planning to go to Paris this year, if so, are you interested to attend the Council ? We are happy to organise Council if there will be enough interest to attend the gathering. Tagging a couple of OGs @gcolvin @jpitts @5chdn @owocki @Ethernian @tvanepps @mariapaulafn @boris @tomislavmamic @makoto @pet3rpan ",
