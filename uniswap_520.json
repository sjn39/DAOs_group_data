Benefits: -We are swaping UNI for top assets which value will go up over time. -There is no dump of new tokens. (New tokens are backed with underlying asset) -We are earning more from every transaction and LP is growing organically. -No risk that someone can take liquidity from us. -As Bitcoin price and Ethereum price go up, the value of UNI assets go up as well. Risk: Is it wBTC really decentralized (safe)? It sounds as win win solution for me. Please write your thoughts on this idea. Thank you. ",

In practice I\u2019m not sure that it will be easy to coordinate managing the UNI treasury, given the barriers to passing proposals for this project in particular. Are there any governance token projects with community distribution that actively manage their treasury? Would be cool to see how others are doing it. EDIT: Looks like AAVE and SNX might actually do this - still need to learn more though, reading about it here: Maker Stability Module, inspired by Aave and Synthetix - Governance - MakerDAO Maybe we can put UNI in a Maker vault, and then lend the Dai on Compound.
