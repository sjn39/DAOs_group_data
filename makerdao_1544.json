                    "content": "Hello, I\u2019m cazala, one of Decentraland\u2019s core contributors. I\u2019m writing this signaling request today to ask the Risk team and the community to consider lowering the stability fee for MANA vaults, currently sitting at 6%. Background Last year there was a singal request to offboard multiple collaterals, one of them was MANA (link). I stepped in back then and talked with some people from Maker and the Decentraland Foundation (i\u2019m not part of the Decentraland Foundation, but since I\u2019ve been part of the communty for a long time I\u2019m in touch with many people there) to see what we could do to keep the collateral. The solution back then was to increase the SF of the MANA vault from 3% to 6% to meet the $300k/year cost of the oracles (link) until MANA liquidity could be improved on-chain to raise the debt ceiling and allow higher utilization to bring the fees down back again. And so we reached out to MANA whales + the Foundation opened vaults to keep the product alive until it could be sustainable. This was in December, and it was discussed in that topic that once the debt ceiling reached 10M (it was 5M at that time) the SF could be lowered again (link). Currently the gas cost associated with Oracle updates have lowered drastically, but even considering the same costs as last year, the debt ceiling has been increased by three fold and it\u2019s at 15M DAI and 100% utilization. There\u2019s a 2M debt ceiling increase scheduled (taking the DC to 17M) that is expected to yield another $120k/year in fees if fully utilized (link). Even deducting the $300k/year Oracle expenses, the MANA vaults are generating a net revenue of $600k/year (link). I know that several owners of MANA vaults who stepped in last year to keep the product afloat are starting to look at alternatives due to the high SF, and I think is sensible considering that you can get DAI using MANA as collateral at Aave for ~1%. I know that MANA doesn\u2019t have a deep on-chain liquidity (although it is quite decent on exchanges), but other vault types with similar liquidity issues, low usage, net negative revenue and higher risk premium have stability fees of 2.5% and 3%, like LINK and MATIC respectively. So I\u2019m asking the Maker community to please consider lowering the stability fee for the MANA vault back to 3%.    Should the MANA-A Stability Fee be Reduced to 3%  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      updated by Patrick_J to amend poll options and add next steps  Next steps: This poll will return for 14 days until 2022-08-22T17:00:00Z. If the result is a \u201cYes\u201d vote, an on-chain poll will follow. ",

                    "content": "Hey @cazala. Can\u2019t speak for MOMC group that proposes rate changes but I can provide input from @Risk-Core-Unit. Calculated risk premium for MANA-A vault type starts quickly approaching 10% when debt exposure moves from 15m to 20m. Since debt ceiling got utilized at 15m and we suggested additional 2m increase, we proposed to keep 6% rate fixed for time being. The risk model assumes black thursday type of price crash of 50%+ within a day and then simulates auctions outcome based on the on-chain liquidity which you can see on chart below is very poor, actually the lowest among collateral tokens Maker holds (selling $1m of MANA leads to 12% slippage on-chain). It\u2019s true however that off-chain liquidity isn\u2019t as bad and we\u2019d likely see arbitrage between off-chain and on-chain pricing during liquidations. But at the same time liquidations throughput for MANA at Maker is set to be very limited due to questionable on-chain liquidity that keepers mostly rely on. This explains why our model is very conservative at simulating potential losses.  That said, MOMC group is also aware of of competitive rate at Aave and also the fact that oracle costs have dropped significantly. We are holding next meeting in about 3 weeks. If community supports 3% SF, we\u2019ll revise our proposed SF, but ideally Risk would push towards some compromise between 3% and 6% SF, especially now when DC was proposed to be slightly increased.

As you said, liquidity on exchanges is way higher and unless you are trying to sell $1M of MANA in a single tx you can probably do it in smaller chunks and let the market arb it back in a short while without such slippage. Regarding a black thursday-like event, if it serves as a reference, during that day there was no bad debt generated in Aave (and there were over 50M tokens deposited as collateral there), and during the recent LUNA crash, MANA went from above $1.60 to $0.69 according to the OSM (yes I was watching closely ) without issues on the vaults.

Even if debt exposure would decrease to 5-10M dai, I wouldn\u2019t recommend lowering it to 3%. To the contrary, I would recommend increasing the stability fee in case debt weighted CR continues to decline. As of right now, Maker is assuming market risk towards MANA due to its lack of liquidity - this is the least liquid collateral asset within MCD. Some portion of permissionless liquidity is also provided by the same party who is minting MANA backed debt. MANA-A used to be one of the most collateralized vault types; during the end of 2021, beginning of 2022, the debt weighted CR was above 1500%. The CR started to decline more rapidly after March, as it reached 360% at some point. Currently it is a bit higher due to recent price increase across the majority of crypto assets. The debt exposure of the vault type rapidly increased during May and June, from ~4.8M to current 15M dai. This means that drop in debt weighted CR was due to general price decrease of MANA and additional borrowing from mostly existing collateral. This basically means that MANA became from previously highly unlikely to be liquidate and produce bad debt due to low liquidity to now likely to the point where liquidation could occur based on historical drawdowns. MANA experienced a 58% daily drawdown during the 2021 May 19th crypto market crash. ",
