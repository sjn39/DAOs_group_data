                    "content": "MakerDAO Community, As a long-time supporter of the MakerDAO project and a representative of OneStone Delegation Platform, I am writing to express my concerns about the current state of the project. It is with a heavy heart that I share these sentiments, as I believe that MakerDAO is facing an identity crisis that is causing many of its supporters to lose faith in the project. There are several critical issues that require urgent attention. Firstly, it is essential that the project\u2019s leadership becomes more receptive to constructive feedback. While acknowledging and respecting the tremendous efforts of Rune, it is vital that the project embraces feedback that can facilitate growth. An anonymous inbox is not a bad idea. Additionally, the community has raised concerns about the presence of paid actors who seem to be financially motivated to remain in Rune\u2019s good graces (post likes should not determine outcomes). This kind of dynamic can impede new members from joining and hinder the project\u2019s progress. Therefore, MakerDAO must take steps to address this issue promptly. The main issue facing MakerDAO is its inability to differentiate itself from other stablecoins, such as USDC, GUSD, and USDP. Although DAI is a decentralized stablecoin, its collateral ratios do not offer enough protection if one of its collaterals fails, putting the entire project at risk. Moreover, DAI\u2019s objective appears to be unclear, as it shifts from being an equitable access global currency that provides USD exposure via a hard peg to providing loans to support nuclear energy projects and other risky speculative projects that SubDAOs would support with MakerDAO\u2019s capital. At the core of this problem is the protocol\u2019s reliance on USDC. While there is a division in the community on whether to increase or decrease exposure to USDC, the reality is that USDC is an integral part of the crypto world as it is the only direct on/off-ramp solution. DAI cannot track the USD value closely without having some exposure to USDC. However, DAI is heavily backed by USDC, which means that it bears the same regulatory risks of USDC but without the ability to invest directly in real-world investments without incurring costs and having to rely on arrangers and other trusted parties to return capital to the protocol. The protocol must make a clear stance on whether it wants to lean into this partnership or minimize its exposures. There exist other structural problems, such as a lack of sophisticated risk management, a robust investment policy that incorporates counterparty, fx, interest rate and duration risk, understanding of mark to market value of real world collateral, balance sheet management, and asset liability management. While these issues are solvable, it is crucial to address them expeditiously. However, the primary focus should be to define the project\u2019s strategy, given the numerous back-and-forths regarding DAI\u2019s USD peg stance, which has caused confusion within the community. Due to the upcoming endgame changes, the delegation platform that I am part of will come to an end when those changes are introduced, and until then I will continue to vote based on what I believe would be best for MakerDAO. However, if there are opportunities to return to the protocol, I would be happy to provide my advisory services on topics related to balance sheet management, liability duration and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and asset liability management. In conclusion, I urge the MakerDAO team to take these concerns seriously and work towards addressing them. The community believes in the potential of the project and wants to see it succeed. I stand ready to offer my expertise and guidance to help MakerDAO overcome these challenges and achieve its goals. Thank you for your attention, and I wish the protocol the best in its future endeavors as it continues to navigate unprecedented times. Sincerely, Onestone Delegation Platform ",
