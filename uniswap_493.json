It is a more liquid form of gas because it can be bought and stored at times when gas is cheap and released (spent/burnt) when gas is expensive GasToken takes advantage of the \u201cstorage refund\u201d on the Ethereum network. Smart contracts are designed to store data forever. Ethereum pays for freeing up the data saved previously while storing GasTokens. This refund is enough to cover up to a half of the transaction cost. Therefore, while others execute their transactions by paying the full market gas price, those who previously banked GasTokens, burn these tokens back to the smart contract and get a refund that covers up to 50% of their transaction fees.

                    "content": "Being a casual speculator I\u2019ve also regretted taking my ERC-20 coins off the centralised exchange I was using, purely because a trade can cost more than 10% of the value of the amount of tokens I\u2019m wanting to swap. I see major threats to Uniswap from layer 2 platforms like Loopring, for instance, it seems that the Loopring platform is building some momentum since it is bypassing these higher fees and I think it is suffice to say they\u2019ll be able to acquire the bulk of small-time users who\u2019re wanting to use crypto how it\u2019s meant to be used, if exchanges like Uniswap don\u2019t bring a similar solution to high fees out soon.   Decrypt \u2013 9 Feb 21    Loopring Sees 40,000 Daily Transactions as Ethereum Fees Rise - Decrypt Constantly growing transaction fees are driving Ethereum users to alternative second-layer solutions such as Loopring.      I\u2019d be really curious to know what progress is being made by the Uniswap team on layer 2 tech since the Unipig.exchange project demo\u2019d, I\u2019ve seen from other posts that the proverbial cards are being kept close to the chest for fear of them being adopted by competitors like SushiSwap, but something like this seems like the obvious step for most DEXes on Ethereum to persue.
