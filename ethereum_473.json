ETH2 Github Repos  https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs  https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-pm \u2013 equivalent to AllCoreDevs, this is where meetings and calls and notes are handled in issues https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-tests  Afri:  estimated timeline?  Danny:  lot of client teams here working on it  Paul G  Sigma Prime \u2013 building ETH2 client called Lighthouse first mistake \u2013 getting up and giving a timeline for a sw project! (laughter) very difficult to plan March next year (2019) multiple teams working in a decentralized manner  Lane:  what is the biggest thing that could take longer?  Paul G / Sigma Prime  can\u2019t think of an unknown \u2013 if we come across a problem with the spec  Lane:  what is Parity\u2019s perspective  Afri:  we are excited \u2013 have a proof of concept built on top of Parity Substrate we are even more far away than other teams, because we joined later parity is a bit more conservative implementing new specs  Afri:  cross client test net need a new test net that isn\u2019t proof of work  Jaciek / Nimbus Status Client:  ETH2 is not just the beacon chain execution, working out sharding, a whole different world two specs merged \u2013 I see March as a PoC, validate some assumptions Give out to community to start tearing apart  Danny:  targeting first half of next year, is going to pressure us to get the spec in line serialization formats, wire formats \u2013 some things that are outside of the spec  Jaciek:  a push gives a target to work against give rest of community something to play around with  Lane:  in Council of Berlin lots of questions about core, roadmap what is the roadmap? does anyone control it? how is it maintained? everyone up here is core?  Vitalik  public HackMD file recently moved to Github as of Sept 20  LANE: What is the Ethereum roadmap? Danny:  ever evolving as needed any one version can say what it is  Vitalik:  first documents \u2013 Ethereum Whitepaper then around March 2015 Vinay Gupta, blog post \u2013 Ethereum Launch Process Frontier Homestead Metropolis Serenity Switch to PoS in Serenity Implemented 5/8ths of that vision After Homestead delayed by DAO Metropolis split into Byzantine, new things of pre-compliles, then Constantinople, and possibly other small hard forks and then Serenity \u2013 move to Proof of Stake this was something floated as an idea, since the beginning ideas around sharding developed and tacked on over time I feel like there always has been this impression \u2013 keep on upgrading and improving the protocol getting PoS finished scalability through sharding and other improvements before 2017 much less clear, then CasparFFG hybrid PoS, sad to see it go because I wrote it realized it make more sense that PoS and sharding with beacon chain would make more proof of stake where do they live? Between blog posts, EthResearch, end of last year, home for research discussions, that\u2019s where a lot of the protocol discussions happen some point was a spec in HackMD, that was moved to Github, when we\u2019re past editing it every week at this point, proposed changes, will live in issues and PR in the repo replacing withdrawal time period with withdrawal rate max github issue and EthResearch thread most abstractly \u2013 goes back several years EthResearch defacto home for that \u2013 changes to CasperFFG, proof of custody, cross shard transactions Eth2 is fine grained  Afri:  what is the timeline for eWASM?  Vitalik:  soon? eWASM will be the VM for the shard chains  Vitalik:  retire the VM important to reduce complexity  Jamie: What is the currency of ETH2  how is that considered by the community?  Vitalik:  make deposits on beacon chain withdraw to shard ether on PoW chain to shard chains intention to don\u2019t feel like anyone has fully decided  Paul:  same ETH as current chain agree with moving it on to shards  Jaciek  when applications move over affects which eth is eth \u2013 where value in ETH2 comes over that\u2019s up to each application to decide when to move  Paul:  you never have to move majority might  Bryant:  tools, have a solid toolset for EVM eWASM has new opportunities around LLVM not clear to me how we can be ready to go with the tooling ready to go  Vitalik:  eWASM as a backend for Solidity Vyper  Greg:  eWASM and EVM is like an argument community seems to be conflict averse at universities and for profit companies \u2013 technical arguments can become very conflictual and then you go to the bar together professors hiring people so they can have someone to argue with the aversion to conflict causes more conflict from early on we\u2019ve had an EVM to eWASM tool, that you can compile VM to as Bryant says, we have a toolset that is growing the longer it takes to get ETH2, the more EVM code is out there and if people ask me, how do you write high value contracts \u2013 and we have contracts with $Ms of dollars in value I would first write a formal specification, and then write the program in assembly, and then prove that the assembly implements the specifications and leave high level compilation out of it \u2013 trust as many tools as possible can do the same thing with eWASM, once it exists we don\u2019t know how long that will be if we try and deprecate EVM1, we are going to create a lot of complexity for people who are using it to get work done well, we\u2019re writing in Solidity so they have to recompile \u2013 because lots of people hired people, and now their contracts just work \u2013 no desire, no money, to hire somebody to port their contracts we\u2019ve put them in a position  Bryant:  creates a barrier to entry to ETH2 on top of learning sharding, the new beacon chain  Greg:  doesn\u2019t mean eWASM shouldn\u2019t be the base of things can\u2019t just abandon what we have have to keep evolving what we have talking to other development teams \u2013 yeah, we\u2019re working with EVM1, has some problems, wouldn\u2019t be hard to fix  @Ethernian:  account abstraction?  Bryant:  time to restructure data structures \u2013 different asset trees?  Vitalik:  abstract nonces vs abstracting signatures vs. (something) This concept has been discovered but not totally thought through yet.rough y (some text missed)   Danny:  earlier there was the sentiment of not doing work on EVM I think that we do have time to coordinate on forks on the next 2 years that\u2019s Danny\u2019s opinion think that good idea that EVM is functional and improved  Greg:  EIP615 and others implemented on Aleph CPP  Lane:  is there more than one Ethereum roadmap?  Danny:  parallel  Greg:  From the beginning I\u2019ve said there is nothing technically keeping us from making EVM1 run at any speed From what I hear, the problem is that we don\u2019t have the technical competence to do so. But we have a very large community and a lot of money I don\u2019t have a problem with eWASM but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. But if that\u2019s where the group, sobeit  \u2013 missing notes \u2013 Greg Casey  parallel between eWASM and EVM why can\u2019t we just improve EVM? easier to just switch to eWASM because so much tooling available (Bryant: not for smart contract use case) ideally main chain just upgrades and its cheaper gas price for everyone \u2013 but that\u2019s possible in theory EVM was developed for the usecase of smart contracts (solidity, serpent), but not for the use case of computing complex cryptographic functions I disagree with Greg on that EVM is proper place to improve for this use-case. It seems like this is the much harder path than to go with EWASM  Greg  I could see an idea of having parallel compilers, one that is more economical (slower) and one that is much faster. But in the current spec, EWASM needs to be validated on the EVM  (missed some notes) Ethernian (here is the question I had, but failed to ask clearly): \u201cDo you think the governance (especially release workflow) should be part of ETH2 specification? May be as some kind of \u201crelease game\u201d ? IMHO, most security deficits we have, are not in the math or software but in workflow and governance. As an example I would mention a bitcoin bug fixed hiddenly and nobody have ever noticed that the patch doesn\u2019t match the bug description. It means our assumptions about release audits made by community are not realistic and that means huge security risk.\u201d Lane  Please, if any of this is going over anyone\u2019s heads, feel free to stand up and let us know.  Boris  E2specs and ethresear.ch are now the primary forums for discussing compiler research and where decisions are being made What about EIPs?  Danny  In my opinion, we\u2019re a little to early for a formal EIP process (lots of missing notes) I would say that there is no theoretical problems on PoS  Vitalik  There\u2019s a lot of little issues, but that\u2019s all The nice thing about the roadmap is that because it\u2019s in phases, so not everything is dependent on phases, so not everything else The role randomness plays in roadmap: the way the protocol has been designed does not require secure randomness. Attacker can\u2019t roll back even a single block Randomness completion is nice but not necessary  Danny  Randomness comes from RanDAO Contractual method for randomly determining who gets to submit a block Mechanism for vbalidators to participate on beacon chain, which reveals the randomness for the next \u201cround\u201d Can say that RanDAO is biasable. We do have people researching to harden and propose strong randomness  Vitalik  Immature blockchains: one guy makes a block, next guy makes a block and chooses another block to build on, another guy makes a block and chooses a block, etc Problem with PoS is that if you can predict who will be making the blocks ahead of time (e.g. I know in a span of twenty, I\u2019ll make 15)  Marek  Question: Would it make sense to do more evolutionary/iterative approach with lots of small hardforks  Vitalik  That\u2019s kind of it. Start with beacon chain and then other small steps  Danny (missed comments) Lane  We definitely need help with Project Management on roadmap. Open call (even if you have less technical skill)  Ryan  Eth2.0 goal is to be live during WWIII  Casey  Is it okay to compromise on that goal? If the world is falling apart, why do we need this?  Etherian  Does this fall into a blanket question of governance? Should we make governance a part of Eth standard? Actually more formal?  Boris  can you clarify?  Etherian  I feel like we don\u2019t have governance as a standard. Think of last Bitcoin hack, there was no governance to find and discover it. Huge security  Boris  More about hardfork? I\u2019ll redirect, how do you coordinate consensus among clients to determine which forks?  Danny  Right now it\u2019s still pretty early Research is still primarly EF, but we\u2019re seeing more from Parity, Status, Pegasus, etc. It\u2019s really more of a coordination problem I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re moving too fast or two slow.  Vitalik  If all researchers that retire tomorrow, is the research they\u2019ve done satisfactory for Eth2.0? We\u2019re not there yet, some areas where a little more research is valuable. Even on L1 \u2013question from Etherian-- how do we test PoS in situation there is no actual value at stake? We could launch a beacon chain with small intervals (only for the data layer) in real time to get technical information.  Question from audience  How do current ERC20 contracts fit and migrate to 2.0?  Vitalik  If you have contract for simple, short-lived interactions, just copy/paste onto EWASM and phase one out Could be centralized airdrop or script that burns coins on one side and mints them on another side Non-financial dApps can just move really quickly Solidity in many cases will compile to eWASM Could stay on 1.0 chain until it eventually folds into 2.0 chain, in which case it will require some client-side work. Could make light client for 2.0chain that fits into 1.0 chain Ultimately, this research is something we\u2019d be interested in giving research grants for.  ",
