                    "content": "Enough people have contacted me with questions that it felt appropriate to clarify to everyone what I do and don\u2019t think, mostly about whether I plan to vote, and what I think about the over 9000 MKR borrowed by a single address on Aave. First of all, I do plan to vote, but I have some concerns about frontend supply chain security due to recent attacks on the industry, so I am taking a day to check what I need to be sure I am signing the correct thing. I think it is reasonable to think that if a product like defisaver was impacted, then we should have some kind of assurance from maker frontend operators that their frontend delivery mechanism cannot be compromised. We have ethereum, let\u2019s actually use it. Second, the outcome of any particular vote is mostly irrelevant to me. I have moved on to the other projects precisely because I think that MKR-vote represents a failure of the design of an incentive-compatible stablecoin system. I imagined defi more like the internet itself, a sort of public utility that is architecturally impossible to \u201cown\u201d, but is available as a tool for anyone, with market incentives and competition driving the system. MKR voting was a proxy for mechanisms that needed further research before we were willing to lock them down. The same is actually true for price feeds, and I think the solution addresses both of these at once. I think everyone knows my take on voting already and knows why I have been mostly absent. My vote represents what I am hearing about the desire to simply have more time to understand all the implications of these proposals. The current system works, people are asking for more time to scrutinize the proposed changes, and for more time to flesh out the details so there is something substantial to analyze. Some people are also concerned that there is a large amount of borrowed MKR, with over 9000 MKR borrowed in just one address, at the same time as a contentious vote. This doesn\u2019t bother me either, and I will explain why below. The only thing that bothers me is the inconsistency between the desire to implement \u201cstkMKR\u201d with reasoning that it is a way to defend against governance attacks by borrowing MKR, and the relative lack of concern now when there is a large borrow balance on AAVE that, in theory, could be swinging the vote. My position is that there should be no stkMKR, and that if there is voting in a system with immutable core rules it is not automatically malicious to vote with borrowed MKR, any more than using bought MKR. But if you were concerned about that before, shouldn\u2019t you be concerned now? But again, I am not concerned. First of all, the idea that this balance is being used to vote is just one of several possibilities that I think are all perfectly legitimate. This implies the funds were sent to binance for on-chain privacy, but the user might have sent the funds to binance to actually sell them, or both, or even neither, simply as a kind of poker play. If they are selling, it is a form of trading just like any other, and it doesn\u2019t imply that they are \u201cagainst\u201d the project. You might sell MKR even if you support the Maker project if you see better returns elsewhere, then you can obtain more MKR later, and that\u2019s a valid strategy. In these cases, market feedback is obvious. If they were just short selling, and have covered, then it might have been a good trade! In that case they are rewarded with more MKR and proportionally more influence in the system. We can only speculate, and it is their business anyway. Back to voting: I think it\u2019s fine that this user might be borrowing to vote, to the extent voting is present in the system (later, I hope this can look less like voting and more like market participation). The game-theoretic analogy for why I think it is ok to vote with borrowed MKR is the analogy of the peacock.  When a user borrows MKR to vote with them, they are intentionally choosing a less capital-efficient strategy for obtaining MKR. The low liquidity for MKR is a two-sided street, there are many sellers who would have sold them a part of their position at spot, including myself, so this is very much an intentional move. Furthermore, they are broadcasting this move, by a very public position on aave! Even if this position were held on a private exchange, it would still be visible, expressed in the interest rate. The reason a peacock grows a large tail is to show to the \u201cmarket\u201d that it is capable of generating and sustaining a large surplus \u2013 in the case of the peacock, surplus energy and the right adaptations for acquiring food and such. If a peacock can obtain all the resources it needs and evade predators while also carrying a large beautiful tail like an advertisement, it is rewarded by nature with all the best mates in the area. But if a peacock over-extends its resources into \u201cappearances\u201d, without much \u201csubstance\u201d, then that peacock might find itself unable to leap to safety at the right time because of the weight of that tail, and might get eaten by a tiger from the jungle. If the large MKR borrow balance on aave is being used to vote, then what that address wants to say to the market is, \u201cEverybody look! We have so much surplus capital, we need to use just a fraction of one part of our portfolio to achieve our ends. We can easily pay this interest rate, and have backup for this risky position. If the poll is inconclusive, don\u2019t bother with any of those cold keys, they won\u2019t be enough.\u201d If it works, then it actually saves everyone money, because it prevents a costly zero-sum-minus-fees fight from ever starting. I have tried to explain my perspective that MKR with buy/burn is the \u201cfully reduced\u201d form of the risk share. The most efficient way to have exposure to Maker system risk/reward is to hold MKR. Another intuitive way to say this: If you create stkMKR, there will eventually be a derivative token to abstract it into something where all value is represented in the price, like the \u201cve*\u201d trend among coins that use less efficient mechanisms. Another way to view this is that holding MKR directly is the least risky way of having MKR exposure! If you borrow MKR to be able to vote with it, you are intentionally locking up at least that much capital, which multiplies the risk from MKR volatility, and you are also paying an interest rate. stkMKR would make stkMKR the least risky way some of the time, but sometimes not, and also introduces the possibility of MKR holders thinking it is part of the protocol design for them to meddle with the risk/reward feedback of the system\u2019s risk-share. I think it is incidental complexity that improves nothing, and breaks the mechanism in a subtle way. You can always implement \u201cstaking returns\u201d by just selling your MKR proportionally to how much was burned! All that said, it is critical for the surplus auction to actually be running in times of surplus, otherwise the system does not have balanced incentives. Right now, all MKR holders I have spoken to are assuming that the disruption to the incentive structure is a temporary software issue with off-chain components (which I assume have been improved by now so it is a non-issue at this point). They assume that the surplus will continue to offset their risk of holding MKR, meaning it will be flowing to continuous buy/burn auctions. But most are cautious of potential threats to this assumption, because of how many well-intentioned crypto voters have broken their own systems in the recent past. This post is already pretty long, I have covered most of the \u201cwhat I do and don\u2019t think\u201d component, I will follow up soon with the \u201chow and why I plan to vote\u201d part. Once again I tried to start voting yesterday, but was spooked by supply chain attacks and decided to wait a bit. In any case, since this is a \u201cpolling\u201d proposal, I understand the stakes are not high, as there is plenty of time for everyone to reason clearly about all the options before any votes that might actually change the state of the Maker system.

At the moment I don\u2019t see what could go \u2018wrong\u2019 for people who decide to borrow MKR on aave to vote (call them the peakcocks) Suppose somebody even tries to push MKR-price up, to margin call the peakcocks. At any moment the peakcocks can bail out, take the MKR out from the voting contract, repay the debt (adding some minimal fees accumulated in just 24/48h) and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s not as if the peakcocks were shorting MKR or anything risky. Their borrowed MKR is always in their hands. It\u2019s a risk free game. [If not please explain, as it would be interesting.] REMARK: We could make it risky by requiring the voting MKR to be locked in the voting contract for a certain period of time (like even just 1week). This seems a reasonable and simple to implement policy.     nikolai:  My position is that there should be no stkMKR   I\u2019d love if @rune could comment on this because I am sure he has been pushing for some kind of (rewarded) locking period for voting MKR.
