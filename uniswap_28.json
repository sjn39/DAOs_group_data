They will distribute that on several period, so many people believe that the addresses which can claim 400 UNI airdrop will get another UNI in the future which is every year until 2024 if I am not mistaken. So, could the team explain who contributor grants, community initiatives and liquidity mining are? is it included the people who already can claim 400 UNI airdrop before? Elaborate more please. Thanks in advance ",
