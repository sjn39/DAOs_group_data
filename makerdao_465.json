To cap off the year, let\u2019s zoom out and take a look at the macros. How much have these chains grown, and how much DAI has left home for \u201cgreener\u201d pastures?  Circulating Dai and Quarterly Growth by Layer-1   as of December 16, 2021   Avalanche  While it may not show in the quarterly numbers, if we step back just another month, Avalanche\u2019s growth is staggering. Even without the (recent) parabolic boost, AVAX has quickly grown into Dai\u2019s favorite side-chain. On September 2nd, the chain clocked in at just under 284 million Dai split between 550 addresses. Fast forward to mid-December, and AVAX now hosts over 547 million Dai or ~6% of the total supply.  Bridges   Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge Anyswap  Synapse | stablecoins only     Fantom  Fantom saw the largest quarterly growth of the  layer-1s we\u2019ve been tracking with a 330% increase in circulating Dai - climbing from 71.3 million Dai in September, to over 306 million today. The chain now holds ~361 million Dai or 3.3% of the total supply.  Bridges   Anyswap  Synapse | stablecoins only   Note: The chain\u2019s top DEX, SpookySwap, has also integrated with Anyswap to wrap and bridge ERC-20 tokens to Fantom using their UI.   xDAI  The xDAI chain was an early starter but found itself on the wrong side of the DeFi frenzy for the majority of the year. This quarter saw it start to right the ship. September saw circulating Dai on the chain reach a low of 19.7 million, but a realignment of strategy and vision propelled that total back up to 41.8 million. The leap was good for a quarterly increase of 112.4% in circulating Dai.  Bridges   Dai to xDai Bridge OmniBridge Hop Protocol cBridge   Circulating Dai and Quarterly Growth by Layer-2   as of December 16, 2021 Layer-1s certainly have the edge in TVL and user-base, but in terms of raw growth, layer-2s have grown and then some. Here\u2019s the breakdown:   zkSync led the pack with a quarterly increase of over 8,815% in circulating Dai.  Aztec and Arbitrum weren\u2019t far behind with respective increases of 5650% and 4739% in on-chain Dai.  Optimism and Loopring are picking up steam, but their combined increase of 477% in on-chain Dai was lackluster relative to the competition.  With the pace that zero-knowledge\u2019s (zK) moving, this list could look quite a bit different a year from now - but one thing is near certain. As base-layer Ethereum advances towards a layer-2 future, rollup solutions will only continue to grow. As a whole, 64.68 million Dai has bridged to layer-2 solutions, representing 0.7% of Dai\u2019s total supply and a 19,681% quarterly net increase.  Bridges      Platform Bridges Tokens     Arbitrum Ethereum-Arbitrum Bridge ERC-20   Arbitrum Anyswap ERC-20   Arbitrum Synapse Stablecoins   Arbitrum & Optimism Hop Protocol ERC-20   Optimism Optimism Gateway ERC-20   Optimism cBridge ERC-20   Loopring Loopring Wallet ERC-20   zkSync ZkSync Wallet ERC-20      Dai Bridged (relative)  This chart visualizes the relative growth of the tracked chains over time.  1245\u00d7485 74.2 KB  The year saw parabolic growth throughout the DeFi landscape, and nearly every functioning L1, L2, and side-chain has found itself a benefactor. This can be seen in the above overview - but it also helps to illustrate just how fast the sands can shift in the cryptosphere. Secret Network, xDAI, and zk Hopium were Q1\u2019s superstars, but that was quickly put to bed in April, which saw a resurgence in DeFi activity propelled by Polygon and Fantom. Then came Q4 - headlined by massive liquidity mining programs, and a bridge to every L1 under the sun. With Dai already showing up on so many different chains, it\u2019s exciting to think about all the new places it will go in the coming year.  Notes Thank you to any and all readers and contributors for the help in molding this newsletter into what it is today! We\u2019ve made some serious headway in our little treasure hunt, and I\u2019m ecstatic to continue into the new year. That said, if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like to see added to these breakdowns - or any feedback on their future direction - please feel free to leave a message in the comments or DM me, @seth, or @JerryAG. Thanks for reading, and HAPPY HOLIDAYS!  This is for informational purposes only. We do not endorse any of the projects referenced in this update.
