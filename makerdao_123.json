Paragraph Summary This proposal contains the MKR Compensation budget for the Core Unit RWF-001: Real-World Finance. This proposal is based on Alternative MKR Compensation Guidelines by @Aes. It provides an average of 80 MKR per FTE per year over 3 years with a 1 year cliff.  Team MKR Compensation Plan We used Alternative MKR Compensation Guidelines by @Aes, currently a MIP in RFC phase, as it was extensively discussed with plenty of time for comments.  Vesting Details     Property Value     Vesting Period 3 years   Cliff Vest 12 months   Vesting Schedulue After the cliff has expired, the Quarterly MKR amount vests every 3 months and is distributed on July/Oct/Jan/Apr 1st, depending on each individual onboarding   Estimated Max Total team MKR After 1 Year (7 FTE)* 560   Estimated Max Total team MKR After 3 Years (7 FTE)* 1,680    Note that this estimation is based on all 7 FTEs joining the Real-World Finance Core Unit on day 1. There are currently only 4.5 FTEs working for the Real-World Finance Core Unit, some having joined recently. Equality The MKR compensation is planned to be flat between contributors with a difference between the highest and lowest below x2 on a FTE basis (vs x3 in the guidelines). Inclusion of non full-time contributors While the Core Unit is looking to be filled by full-time contributors, we recognized that experimented part-time members are bringing significant value to the Core Unit. Therefore, they will be included pro-rata of their participation. Transferability We anticipate people from the Core Unit to migrate to another Core Unit and/or create their own Core Unit at some point. Any accrued MKR will be transferred to the person at the end of the vesting period.  MKR Vesting Schedule      MKR Total     April 2022 560   July 2022 140   October 2022 140   January 2023 140   April 2023 140   July 2023 140   October 2023 140   January 2024 140   April 2024 140    This covers the total vesting schedule of 3 years for the planned 7 FTEs. On average, the team MKR vesting schedule yields 80 MKR per FTE per year, or 560 MKR in total per year. Excess MKR token will be returned to MakerDAO with the DSPause address or any other address achieving the same purpose.  Payment Implementation MKR compensation is based on Manual Budget Implementation, the Simple one and the same as used for the regular budget, or any other method achieving the same result at the discretion of the Governance Facilitators. Real-World Finance Core Unit may consider alternative payment flows compliant with DssVest if the standardized flow is compatible with the vesting schedule.  Payment: based on predetermined MKR compensation schedule Asset type: MKR, minted or coming from an existing source. Address: 0x9e1585d9ca64243ce43d42f7dd7333190f66ca09  ",
