This isn\u2019t related to any of the issues around postponing the fork or the 1283 EIP (which did follow process), but it is an example of how we should track these sorts of things and actually follow process. It seemed hard to get the attention of EIP editors (no reviews, no comments) on what was a basic administrative clean up (setting status on EIPs that were scheduled to be included).

I have worked hard on getting the two-week process adopted (this was part of getting ERC-721 approved) and I believe it has benefitted the community for the ERCs process. It certainly makes it easier for me to find which EIPs I want to review! At the time this was really a big change and risked much criticism so again I appreciate your kind words. However this process also applies to consensus-changing EIPs and it was not followed this time. I believe the issue is that the attitude of EF is /much/ too centralized. They prefer to push their own software changes on the world by announcing on their own channels, rather than using a mildly community-based process like the EIP two-week review. (EDIT: Maybe \u201cprefer\u201d was too strong there, maybe not everyone knows about EIP-1 changes yet\u2026) ",
