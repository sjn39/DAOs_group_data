                    "content": " Adding Utility Functionality to the MKR Token  Proposal One: Creating new utility functionality for MKR tokens through additional capital buffers in off-chain financing structures; founding a secondary, yield-bearing insurance fund as an additional layer behind the Surplus Buffer (the \u201cSecondary Surplus Buffer\u201d); and implementing pro-MKR incentives for certain auctions in MakerDAO. MakerDAO could design a structure that incentivizes more utility use of the MKR token. The core counter-argument to such utility functionality involves user concerns with using one\u2019s own equity as a backstop to bad debt \u2013 in the event of a rapid downturn, the equity may be worth far less than initially planned. One possible way to mitigate such concerns is for the community to ensure any MKR used this way can only be used as an additional buffer, and more importantly, in a manner that adds real utility use cases to the token. With these points in mind, here are three possible sub-proposals for community discussion. (1) Require MKR as additional on-chain collateral for any RWA-based or structured vaults that involve less transparent off-chain liquidation mechanisms, ideally as a form of first-loss capital. This MKR can also be combined with other external assets like ETH as an on-chain collateral package. For context, @flipflopflapdelegate conducted an informal poll on this subject last year. Similar to MakerDAO\u2019s traditional model, those MKR tokens, which could also be combined with other forms of on-chain collateral, like ETH, would be locked in a vault at a value proportional to the size of the debt ceiling (e.g. 2-5% of total exposure, contingent upon a community vote). Although imperfect, this could further improve the alignment of the borrower and act as an extra margin of safety, especially considering the risk of off-chain legal entanglements versus the on-chain liquidation process. As an example, think of an approved Debt Ceiling and an Effective Debt Ceiling for RWA. After the Debt Ceiling has been approved by the protocol, borrowers would have the ability to activate (part of) it by locking MKR tokens (and potentially ETH) at the approved ratio. Once locked, the assets would not be subject to volatility based on market prices \u2013 it would be set at the price the borrower locked their tokens. As a result, borrowers wouldn\u2019t be able to remove surplus on-chain collateral, or conversely, have to replenish the shortfall caused by market fluctuations. In the case of default, with default timing identified based on the off-chain contractual mechanics, the locked tokens would be seized by the protocol and preserved as a treasury asset for the protocol to dispose, discretionarily or programmatically. They do not have to be immediately sold. Again, this on-chain collateral would be in addition to the normal RWA collateral structure. The increased incentive alignment is arguably a feature, not a bug, when weighed against MakerDAO\u2019s burden of additional capital requirements to borrowers. The additional on-chain collateral provided by borrowers, 2-5% of their approved line of credit, should represent a very small portion of the borrowers\u2019 overall assets, and would further provide the community with an on-chain indication of the borrower\u2019s overall capitalization, ability to provide liquid assets, and continued alignment with MakerDAO. (2) Create a Secondary Surplus Buffer to serve as an additional layer of consumer protection (in line with the Self Insurance Fund proposal) that offers a yield distribution to those who voluntarily stake their MKR. Much like other major DeFi insurance pools, these tokens would be used to help backstop a potential shortfall event, in this case beyond that of the System Surplus Buffer. Here are two possible avenues to distribute value in the Secondary Surplus Buffer. In the simpler scenario, stakers would earn yield on a portion of the funds that flow over to the Secondary Surplus Buffer once the System Surplus Buffer is at capacity. For example, 75% of excess funds could be distributed proportionately to stakers, while 25% would accrue in DAI to the insurance pool. A second scenario involves merging this idea into something adjacent to what @monet-supply recently proposed in the forums for stkMKR. However, in this case, MKR holders who stake their MKR into the staking contract would receive yield in the form of DAI, not repurchased MKR, due to regulatory considerations. While a cash-like insurance pool is more appropriate than one denominated in the native token, the System Surplus Buffer effectively serves in this capacity already. The Secondary Surplus Buffer is an additional insurance line that could offer new utility use cases for the token, with positive implications for consumer protection. The community probably has more ideas for this as well, and we would love to hear them! (3) Incentivize auction participants to stake MKR in collateral auctions, better aligning the interests of auction participants with the overall interests of the system (this sub-proposal is inspired by @kurt_barry\u2019s terrific thoughts and writings on the subject, which led directly to many of the follow-on points below). The main idea would be to offer a discount, applied as a rebate, to the collateral being auctioned for participants that stake their MKR in the auction. Staking would be voluntary and denominated in tiers of DAI given MKR\u2019s live market price at the time of the auction, leaving collateral auctions accessible to DEX aggregators and UI bidders, but offering cheaper prices to those who stake. It may also make sense to keep locking periods limited (1-2 weeks post auction) and require a short (perhaps 2-3 minutes) cooling time for staked MKR so an unstaked frontrunner could not get the same price as a staked participant, even if they add staked MKR in their frontrunning transaction. As an example, if a participant stakes at least $10,000 of MKR, they would receive a .25% discount on the collateral. At $100,000 of MKR, a .50% discount. At $1,000,000 of MKR, a .75% discount. At $10,000,000 of MKR, a 1.0% discount. This implies staked participants would achieve profitability sooner than non-staked participants, all other variables being equal. MakerDAO could also tier the discount chart to minimize the advantage of larger participants. In that case, the discounts could be .30% at $10,000 of MKR, .40% at $100,000 of MKR, .45% at $1,000,000 of MKR, etc. One possible shortcoming to this idea would be encouraging auction participants to borrow MKR for the purpose of staking it. This would have the opposite effect on incentive alignment and make those borrowers effectively short MKR. But this could be mitigated by the higher cost of capital for borrowing compared to staking. We are curious to hear the community\u2019s feedback on possible second and third order effects to this idea, or its likelihood of having a material impact.

If depositors here only earn yield when the traditional surplus buffer is full, I think this buffer will only exist in times where the traditional buffer is full.

If we opted for this, it might be good to combine it with a small reduction to liquidation penalties, overwise it acts as an additional fee for the owner of the collateral, but one that is only applied sometimes, and one that isn\u2019t terribly transparent.

                    "content": "Thank you for posting this very interesting series of proposals. I\u2019m excited for the interesting discussion points these will develop. Here are a few thoughts of mine on top of my head, that I hope can spark some discussion and further clarity - forgive me if I have missed some points  For (1) it seems to me that that the amounts proposed in the proposal are negligible in terms of securing the system (2-5% of loan value) and only acts as another hurdle and complexity that does not do much except try to pump the price of MKR a bit. Won\u2019t borrowers just use their credit line to finance this MKR? It hardly gives them any skin in the game, and it seems like it just means a net lower borrow agreement and exposure to the partner - meaning they are simply able to borrow 2-5% less because they need to finance the required MKR. It also brings in this extra complexity of pricing and exposure of MKR. If MKR drops in value post loan agreement, the backstop shrinks as far as I can tell. Also what happens in a liquidation? In this proposal it is unclear, except that we have some extra MKR at hand for flopping or selling, which in both cases will result in downward price action on MKR. For this reason, I think utilizing an existing onchain collateral type as collateral would make more sense - however to me it seems like it does not really provide more protection, just a more capital inefficient system for the borrower. For the auctions incentives (3) I\u2019m concerned about introducing more hurdles to efficient participation in auctions. One of the issues we tried to address with LIQ 2.0 was to ensure broad participation in auctions from a large and healthy ecosystem of keepers. It\u2019s already really difficult to be competitive in this market as an \u201cindie\u201d keeper. We are already seeing professional teams corner the market by having the most sophisticated strategies and development resources. By introducing these incentives it\u2019s no longer just a matter of investing development resources, or inventing the best strategies, you also need to invest in MKR to be competitive, narrowing the field of participation even more. I fear this will result in a keeper ecosystem similar to the one before black thursday where basically a single keeper was participating in the end, making the Maker Protocol less robust to extreme market conditions. It will also make the already hard to sell integrations of LIQ 2.0 into dex aggregators even harder, as they would also need to invest in MKR to be at a level playing field with other market participants. Happy to hear your thoughts on this  ",

We were trying to approach this with a long term perspective, where perhaps the Secondary Surplus Buffer structure is set ahead of time, but it\u2019s not actually put into functional use until the System Surplus Buffer is full (whether from normal sources or a proposal akin to the recent Growth proposal).

Compared to how e.g. expectations of massive future growth could impact MKR price, that seems like a drop in a bucket.

                    "content": "Thanks @lollike for the thoughtful comments! On (1), there is a bit of a distinction between adding new utility vectors to a token design and seeking to create \u201cdemand sinks,\u201d although the functional outputs of both could certainly overlap. This proposal aims to add utility vectors to MKR\u2019s token design, which from a regulatory perspective, creates new dimensions for the token. As you point out, this results in borrowers basically being able to borrow 2-5% less due to financing the required on-chain collateral. This trade off could be worth it. Here\u2019s why. (1) Much like in traditional lending, it requires the borrower to have liquid, transparent assets they can put down against the loan. This is particularly important when dealing with potentially illiquid, off-chain assets subject to complex legal agreements in event of a default on the loan, as it adds a liquid buffer to the loan. In a worst case scenario, at a minimum, MakerDAO can cover its off-chain liquidation operational costs with these on-chain assets, although it could also cover these costs from other funds (like the Surplus Buffer). How could it do so? For one, MakerDAO doesn\u2019t necessarily have to immediately liquidate the collateral. MakerDAO could simply hold the collateral and wait to sell (if the decision is to sell) until more favorable market conditions. If the collateral types are split, MakerDAO could sell the non-MKR collateral and hold the MKR. In summary, I think there are some deliberate ways to work through this point, and there\u2019s not necessarily an immediate need to sell, as 95% of the collateral is off-chain anyway. (2) It\u2019s an important signal. If a borrower is seeking a $100M line of credit, they should have the capacity to put $5M down against it. The capital efficiency issues, at least in my mind, may be less of a concern than the borrower\u2019s overall financial health and ability to put 2-5% down in liquid assets. (3) Although in an admittedly small way, it aligns interests. Much like how banks require liquid down payments on houses or cars, requiring a liquid down payment, in the form of on-chain collateral, for a loan backed by off-chain assets means the borrower has additional skin in the game that is not subject to complex off-chain arbitration. (4) As you mentioned, the value of MKR, or whatever form of on-chain collateral is used, is subject to volatility and this certainly isn\u2019t ideal. Despite this volatility, the new utility use of the token and the added buffer it provides, however small, could be worth the trade-off of the added complexities to the lending agreement. I would love to hear further thoughts from the community on this point. Going back to the theme of utility functionality and its implications, there is a case to be made that the trade-offs could be worth it in the long-term. Regarding the order of operations for potential borrowers, they would be required to post the requisite on-chain collateral before accessing their line of credit. Now, many borrowers could seek to essentially refinance this on-chain collateral purchase after receiving their loan, but they would need access to funds before getting the line of credit, which would help demonstrate their overall capitalization. On (3), let me think a bit more about the \u201churdles to efficient participation in auctions.\u201d The balance here is the perceived marginal benefit of another utility use case for MKR versus adding another requirement that professional keepers will integrate and may \u201cgate keep\u201d other participants out of the auctions. To be clear though, this was designed as a voluntary incentive\u2013it is not a requirement to participate: \u201cStaking would be voluntary and denominated in tiers of DAI given MKR\u2019s live market price at the time of the auction, leaving collateral auctions accessible to DEX aggregators and UI bidders\u2026\u201d Not sure if this changes the overall calculus but wanted to re-emphasize that point for clarity. Thanks again! ",

                    "content": "Thank you for the comprehensive response. I will have to more deeply digest the point on using MKR as collateral in the protocol. From my own experience of working with major keepers in the Maker Ecosystem, I can tell you it is a cutthroat arms race, even for the professional teams, where often a single or few players corner the market. Thus in practice, if you would not opt in for this incentive you are defacto not competitive and it would be a sunk cost for you to keep developing your Keeper. These incentives will therefore not be voluntary in practice, but a requirement if you actually want to be competitive and be able to win auctions and be profitable - which would be the only reason for actually investing your time and money into building and maintaining a Keeper, except for altruistic reasons which is not a strong case for robustness. Consequently anyone who would not opt in for the discount would immediately be much less competitive and cost efficient (if not completely unable to ever win an auction), and would most likely stop developing or run a Keeper, leading to a less competitive ecosystem. However a competitive keeper ecosystem is desirable for Maker, because it means more efficient liquidations. Therefore I think in this case it is in our best interest to keep the barrier of entry as low as possible for the protocol robustness sake. We want to encourage participation, not discourage it. We want to ensure that the indie devs or startup protocols out there at least have a level playing field to compete with professional Keepers to ensure Vaults are liquidated as close to market price as possible without having to also invest a sizeable sum of MKR upfront. The competition today is already low and I fear this proposal would further discourage participation. ",

                    "content": "    Porter_Smith:  (3) Although in an admittedly small way, it aligns interests. Much like how banks require liquid down payments on houses or cars, requiring a liquid down payment, in the form of on-chain collateral, for a loan backed by off-chain assets means the borrower has additional skin in the game that is not subject to complex off-chain arbitration.   I would love to see more comments and discussion about requiring RWA borrowers to post MKR. I like this idea more and more. In addition to the valuable alignment, increased utility and buy pressure for MKR, an on-chain collateral buffer linked to each RWA deal will help me sleep at night. When SHTF, having a great contract and structure are only as good as your ability to enforce the contract against a non-performing counterparty in court after much time and cost. And then, only to the extent there are any assets left once the court gets to you in the line of creditors. I have a long history with ISDA Master Agreements and the related Credit Support Annex documentation. There\u2019s a concept in those arrangements referred to as an \u201cIndependent Amount\u201d. This is an amount of collateral posted by the weaker credit party that sits untouched (its \u201clocked\u201d up in a sense) and is not considered in the daily calculations of collateral that needs to be transferred to a party against amounts owed. Note that these are derivatives trading agreements where amounts owed between counterparties change on a daily basis. One day Party A may owe Party B. The next day, as the price of a reference asset moves, Party B may owe Party A. The parties will actually transfer collateral back and forth on a daily basis when one party owes the other a net amount over a certain \u201cThreshold\u201d. But what happens if there\u2019s a default at the exact time that the party in-the-money becomes the out-of-the-money party? It\u2019s a game of musical chairs. Remember 2008? The music stopped and no one knew where their chair was. And what\u2019s more, there were a LOT more dancers than chairs. In that case you were stuck with exposure and no collateral UNLESS you had negotiated an \u201cIndependent Amount.\u201d An Independent Amount is a specified amount of collateral posted by one party to the other at the beginning of the trading relationship. That posted collateral remains and stays put no matter how the exposure calculation may vary during the term of the parties\u2019 transactions. This Independent Amount is then available and in the possession of the non-defaulting party as extra protection should the \u201cmaintenance\u201d collateral arrangements fail when there is a default. I was in the middle of this kind of mess in 2008 as Energy Counsel for the commodities trading business at Lehman Brothers. The only contracts we could get signed for the entire 6 months before filing for bankruptcy were amendments to Credit Support Annexes. I saw the train coming a mile away because the entire world wanted more collateral protection to continue trading with Lehman up until the last moments. So fair warning everyone: I\u2019m going to be a party pooper about centralized counterparty risk. It\u2019s Lehman Brothers PTSD.  Enhancing collateralization with something crypto native (even stETH, ETH if not MKR) that we have in our control and possession sits very well with me. ",
