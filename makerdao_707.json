That would be the first collection of the marketplace and would have a growing multi-collateral backing. Half of the royalties will go to the Maker treasury or to fund Maker expansion into RWA and RWF , and the other half will increase the multi-collateral backing of the same collection.  77b2ce46-68b8-403c-a0da-dd1b26f3935c1025\u00d7540 21.2 KB  Multi collateral backing in the Collection Each NFT will have a certain amount of WBTC, ETH, LINK, COMP, FTM, MANA, AAVE, YFI, etc., backing it and safeguarding it in a smart contract, that would make the Nft have a more constant and stable floor value than the art ones, it would benefit both Maker and the Nft owner, Maker would be able to bring capital to its treasury and the owner due to the backing of its Nft. If the Nft owner wants the multi-collateral backing, he can use his Nft as a key to access the support that corresponds to his unit. Still, the Nft will be temporarily blocked in the contract until the multi collateral corresponding to the Nft is placed. This proposal could complement this other  one to make the Maker extension for the Nft more complete. Please leave your opinion or proposals. ",

Now if this was backed by UNISWAP v2 wBTC-DAI, ETH-DAI, LINK-DAI, COMP-DAI, FTM-DAI, MANA-DAI, AAVE-DAI, YFI-DAI maybe it would be more interesting because it would be a NFT that is like a market composit that actually earns return and locks tokens paired with DAI\u2026 As this sits I don\u2019t think it would be very useful and just locks away collateral for no real return.  I also don\u2019t think it would trade that much (or the expense to trade it is going to be far higher than the base value of the token). idk. ",

The theory of multi-collateral backing in the Collection is probably interesting as a core proposal. Perhaps some kind of consensus can be established around other related areas. For example: the utility of NFTs to access special governance votes, which would make their price not speculative, rather it would create a valuable asset for those who want to make important decisions. Just thinking about the opportunities can lead to great things, perhaps it should be impacted with a slightly more massive proposal. Greetings! ",
