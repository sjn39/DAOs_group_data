Paragraph Summary This proposal contains the MKR Compensation budget for the Core Unit SNE-001: Starknet Engineering Core Unit, also called SECU in this subproposal. This proposal is based on Alternative MKR Compensation Guidelines 15 and benchmarked on the Protocol Engineering Core Unit (PE-001) budget. It provides an average of 135 MKR per FTE per year over 3 years with a 1-year cliff. In total, it provides 270 MKR to CU members per year over 3 years with a 1-year cliff. The SECU is financed 50/50 by Maker and Starknet. The other half of the value of the incentive will be provided by Starknet with a mix of USD and Starknet tokens. The total value of the USD and Starknet token provided by Starknet CANNOT exceed the value of the MKR allocation in USD.  Specification  Motivation About SECU role PECU and SECU are working very closely to deliver teleport to make DAI the easiest stablecoin to use cross-domains in DeFi. In parallel, numerous bridge hacks have made us have an even more careful approach to designing and scaling teleport. PECU has dedicated team members focused on L2. We are playing a very similar role to those L2-dedicated PECU members. The difference is that we focus less on L1 contract, but more on translating Maker contracts into Cairo, as well as writing new contracts in Cairo, trust assumptions, ad hoc workflows to improve security for MKR and DAI holders (e.g., escape hatch, circuit breaker), and formal verification. SECU has had challenges in the past year to retain and attract talents due to the lack of incentives, which contrasts with the need for the highest standards in our CU. SECU has taken the approach to not ask for MKR compensation from the start, mindful of the fact that the team needed to prove itself and earn trust from the community before. About deliverables **Phase I deliverables ** has been shipped before we started phase II. You can use the bridge here.  SECU has been working over phase I to strengthen the security of the bridge and recently shipped the monitoring infrastructure and the circuit breaker. We have had 30k + individual deposits on the bridge and we have seeded the first ETHDAI AMM on Starknet. Phase II deliverables were: fast withdrawals, wormhole (now teleport). Fast withdrawal contracts have been audited and are ready to be deployed, and we have so far rewritten more than half of the contracts required for teleport in Cairo, we are still working on tests. The timeline for deploying teleport has been pushed back as organizational as well as technical challenges had been underestimated by PECU and SECU. You will find more details in the post from Derek Layer II Roadmap - History and Future. About MKR compensation Many possible frameworks for MKR Compensation have been put forward in the DAO, providing solid principles for MKR compensation that are incorporated throughout this proposal. Our core unit MKR compensation should be very similar to that of PE-001, given the nature of the work we do at the SECU as described above. Alternative MKR Compensation Guidelines 15 suggest a 1.5 multiplier to calculate the MKR compensation, which we are using. Note that out of this 1.5 multiple, Maker is only paying 0.75, Starknet is paying for the other 0.75. The rationale for having a compensation aligned with PECU is based on the fact that dedicated engineers are doing a very similar job with PECU, but focused on EVM chains. One year ago, we decided to create a separate CU for Starknet because the overhead of diving into trust assumptions, learning Cairo, adapting user processes to Starknet trust assumptions, and formal verification would have been a distraction for PE. Additionally, it allowed Maker to only pay for 50% of the total budget and have Starknet finance the other half.  Core Unit ID SNE-001 (Starknet Engineering Core Unit)  List of Budget Implementations Eligibility Anyone currently working for SECU, who has not given notice at the time of this proposal, is eligible for MKR Compensation. Eligibility Period is from September 27th, 2021 until August 5th, 2022 for this proposal, dating back to the inception of the Core Unit. All the members of the Core Unit who are eligible have joined the Core Unit on September 27th, 2021. Eligible MKR compensation will have a cliff of 12 months, meaning SECU contributors will receive their MKR one year after the end of the eligibility period. Formula For all members of SECU, MKR Compensation will be derived based on the salary earned within the Core Unit during the retroactive eligibility period. We will be using the 1.5 multiplier proposed by Aes in Alternative MKR Compensation Guidelines 15. This number is then divided by 2 to account for the equal budget split between Maker and Starknet. The MKR price used is the 3-month average of $1109 (source: CoinMarketCap). MKR transfer  One-off transfer on September 27, 2022, of MKR 270. Representing the MKR payment for one year of work after the cliff. Paid from the Pause Proxy to 0x6D348f18c88D45243705D4fdEeB6538c6a9191F1 Stream of MKR 540 from the Pause Proxy to 0x6D348f18c88D45243705D4fdEeB6538c6a9191F1, starting on September 28, 2022, ending on September 28, 2024  ",

Please let me know if you have further questions. @Doo_StableLab having those discussions with delegates is on my list for the next two weeks.   Until ~ end of 2022 we will be building the teleport infrastructure to assure Starknet is part of teleport. The teleport infrastructure for EVM rollups is currently being built by dedicated engineers within PE. We are doing a very similar job, except in Cairo.   Until Q3 2023, we will be rebuilding the vault engine on Starknet. The vault engine for EVM rollups is being built by dedicated engineers within PE. We are doing a very similar job, except in Cairo.   After we have shipped teleport and the vault engine on Starknet. We will have to make a decision which we already started discussing with PE, particularly @Derek. There are pros and cons to both options:   option i. SECU runs operations the vault engine on Starknet, which means writing spells and implementing upgrades related to initiatives that are voted by governance. This is basically PE\u2019s operational job, but on Starknet option ii. SECU merges with PE and does what is described in option i You can see SECU as an extension of PE that might merge with PE in the mid-term once the development is done. In terms of what we do now, it is very similar to what dedicated PE engineers are focused on. Of course we can take the short-term view and argue that without SECU the protocol would still operate. But given how fast Aave is moving cross-L2, I am not sure it\u2019s a sound strategic argument. Without SECU we would not be building on Starknet which has been identified and voted as a priority. And once the teleport and vault engine build is finished, we would not be able to run operations, which would defeat the purpose. As a side note, we have an engineer who already decided to leave and we have lost candidates to Aave\u2019s protocol engineering team lately. ",

Only Optimism has just a little more than 1% of DAI at the moment, yet dedicated PE engineers are working on the other EVM bridges with lower TVL. Starknet itself has not scaled its own bridge because they are prudent. We will not go faster than them in scaling for obvious reasons. Given all the bridge hacks happening, I don\u2019t think that TVL in bridges is exactly a good single metric to look at for MKR holders just yet. We spend most of our time thinking about how to get rid of trust assumptions, how users can execute a L1 escape hatch, how we can assure to circuit break the bridge in the event of a hack, and how to minimize impact on MKR holders in case a hack is actually successful. A lot of brilliant teams have dramatically failed at those things listed above and scaled too fast (e.g., Nomad this week). And it is not protecting MKR holders in the mid-term to consider L2 as an area where we can afford to let good talents go and attract average talents. Again, MKR holders are only paying for half of the multiple, hence 0.75, not 1.5. The reason is that Starknet is a young but very promising rollup with much faster withdrawal times and an impressive ecosystem of builders. Yet they are early, which is the reason why the budget is shared 50/50. ",

If StarkNet CU is inseparable from work from PECU, then I suggest the governance should look at resource dedicated to both carefully as adjustments within them might be needed. A:   I\u2019d love to share few additional insights on how we work with PE. PE engineers are looking at trust assumptions for Polygon and Avalanche, but there is no work that has started there. They are focused on Optimism, Arbitrum, and zksync will have its bridge but won\u2019t be included immediately in teleport. There are dedicated engineers focused on L2 work within PE, just like we are. Obviously PE is outputting more work that is non-L2 related and more core to the L1 part of the protocol, but it is a much larger group with a much larger budget so I am not sure the comparison holds so much here. We are doing a similar work to what those dedicated CU members do, except that we are working on a non-EVM chain that requires learning Cairo, working around their roadmap, and collaborating with teams doing formal verification work. We collaborate closely on overall design and chain assessment. Regarding the structuring of the teams, we believe that the current structure is the most cost-efficient for Maker because it is financed 50/50, and it makes a lot of sense to have a separate CU focused on Cairo until we finish building teleport and the vault engine on Starknet. PECU and SECU facilitator (myself) have now discussed internally with three options that could make sense but no recommendation has been made yet: i. Keeping the CUs separate ii. Spinning off a CU for L2s specifically iii. Merging PECU and SECU. Having all the L2 engineers in the same CU would be very helpful for many reasons, but also has many drawbacks. We are actively thinking about this but we would suggest to wait until the END GAME becomes clearer, and understand how MetaDAOs might impact the restructuring of L2 work before changing anything.

A: My point is very much not that DAI won\u2019t be in demand on Starknet, Maker decided to expand on Starknet because delegates and large MKR holders think that it will. My point was more that given where Starknet is today it is hard to have a discussion based on TVL only. I would look at metrics such as: developer community and potential TVL looking at the protocols currently developing on it, as well as market-makers community. My second point was related to security. TVL is worth little if bridges get hacked. Obviously hacks are black swan events so we will never get robust statistics around those. However, we are currently doing a review of all the bridge hacks and are designing a circuit breaker that will leverage this analysis. Stay tuned we will share summaries of analyses and design discussions there. ",

A:  MKR is making strategic decisions to expand and we\u2019re all focused on executing this the best we can. I am simply following the guidelines put forward by the Strategic Finance CU here. The rationale for the multiple 1.5 is that we need top engineers to not compromise the security of the protocol. L2 expansion is a hard task in unchartered technical territory.

What I am against is the ad-hoc system for MKR compensation, which is providing a large portion of people\u2019s salaries.   You are more than welcome to take the torch as it were regarding coming up with a consolidated MKR compensation plan. I doubt there is anyone that has worked  more on this than Juan, Wouter, LFW, and myself, with my contributions being completely unpaid as at that time I authored and contributed to those MKR compensation plans I was a community member. I\u2019d recommend starting with the following threads to read through the history and concerns if you\u2019re serious about spearheading a proposal:  Working Group MKR Comp Guidelines Pre-MIP MKR Comp Guidelines MIP Alternate MKR Comp Pre-MIP Alternate MKR Comp MIP MKR Comp Financial Model Pre-MIP SES MKR Comp Plan      CodeKnight:  As we are seeing, it isn\u2019t even fair to CUs as it rewards those clever enough to sneak clauses by the delegates(like SF).   Given the above and the discussion in SF\u2019s MKR compensation thread, this is disingenuous at best. The 2-month trailing average was specifically asked about by one of the largest delegates and was answered publicly. To add onto those comments, our MKR compensation was specifically structured to retain team members during prolonged bear markets, when resources are needed most. All of our full-time contributors have received equal or more attractive offers from competitors. While compensation isn\u2019t the only reason to stay with a team and organization it is important, especially in a DAO where you\u2019re taking more risk contributing compared to a traditional organization. Let\u2019s walk through an example looking at the 6 month trailing price and 30% discount parameters. If a team\u2019s MKR compensation was priced during a bullish time in the markets, at a $3.8K 6-month trailing price, there is a strong incentive to leave the DAO when you can only reprice down to $2.7K (30% discount), which is currently a 245% premium to spot. Let\u2019s look at some more data from the past 22 months and comparing . During that time using a 6-month trailing average, if a team priced their MKR on February 5th 2021, they could\u2019ve locked in a trailing 6 month average of $720 compared to the spot price of $2,700, nearly a 4x premium. Using a 2 month trailing reduces the premium to 2.6x. On the flip side, if a team priced their MKR on June 16th, 2022, they\u2019d be locking in at a 150% premium to spot ($1,826 vs $733 spot) - who would be willing to lock in a 60% lower bonus? The story isn\u2019t much better for the 2month trailing average, which would allow a team to price their MKR at a 83% premium to spot, locking in a 45% lower bonus. The point I\u2019m making with this data is that there are trade-offs for every parameter in a MKR compensation plan. SF has made the conscious choice to bias our plan towards attracting and retaining contributors during bear markets. ",

Going by this logic supporters of this proposal should be prepared to pay the asked for compensation from their own pocket. With more fiscal discipline in earlier onboardings and budgets we could have avoided some of the painful reductions we are now initiating. I will not be supporting this proposal in its current form. While I\u2019m not opposed to a MKR vest in principle, the following proposal have some shortcomings, in my view. One of them is the total compensation sought in relation to the mandate. Another one is due to the agreed upon mandate explicitly stating that no MKR compensation is proposed for phase I. With phase I being extended for a considerable time beyond the original target date I think showing a deliverable is a prudent step prior to seeking increased compensation. After reviewing the original mandate I present the following agreed upon terms:    MIP40c3-SP28: Modify Core Unit Budget - StarkNet Engineering (sne-001)   MKR vesting No MKR vesting is proposed for phase I. A MKR vesting based on deliverables will be proposed for phase II.

Note that we have had between 150k and 170k DAI in the bridge with a limit of 50 DAI deposit. It tells about the interest, 150k/50 = 30k potential users. We are increasing this limit to seed the first AMM on Starknet, we currently have a poll on that. Also note that the monitoring infrastructure you are referring to as \u201cnot done\u201d was not in the original scope but we decided to add it earlier because we were not comfortable given the context with so many hacks. We also added a circuit breaker and an escape hatch mechanism which were not explicitly in scope but again felt very necessary in context. Monitoring infrastructure is now done and being integrated by techops. Phase II deliverables were: fast withdrawals, wormhole (now teleport) Fast withdrawals are done and we will be deploying in a couple of weeks after PE (August 31). Teleport (formerly wormhole) work has started 6 months ago, however we have had delay for reasons @Derek will detail shortly in a post. Tldr, the bridge hacks made us spend much more time thinking about security and design (monitoring, circuit breakers, how to scale), we originally underestimated the management of third parties and the dependencies between the teams (PECU, SECU, data insights, techops, rollups teams), and we also had to rethink the originally proposed design of teleport to accommodate a more generic flush mechanism.

That\u2019s exactly how all firms in finance work for a reason. More and more common in crypto. It\u2019s less risky from the protocol standpoint, more fair and clear, and assures the teams are focused on getting things done. Also the type of people who are fine trusting a protocol to reward them retroactively is the type of people you want to recruit because their intrinsic motivation is high. @ultraschuppi we are not a short-term CU. I am a little bit confused by your comment.  Rereading my post, I agree I could have made things more clear. Not finding excuses but it was my first post on the forum ever and there was no on-boarding to learn how to post or understand how delegates would (retroactively) interpret a post. Facilitator on-boarding is probably something we could improve as a DAO. But just using good sense. It was implied as a long-term CU that we would ask for MKR incentives. How can we expect to be competitive against average companies if we bear a high regulatory risk, don\u2019t provide benefits, and the community assumes long-term workforce would work without incentives. Again we\u2019re all here because we love Maker, particularly those sticking during the bear market, but it does not feel right to hold as a core assumption that we can attract top talents while asking them to take more risk for a lower pay than elsewhere (i.e., flat pay without MKR).
