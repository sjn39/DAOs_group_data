                    "content": "Is Maker complete? Are we done improving the Protocol? Should we burn the admin keys and let Maker run its course? Hypergrowth Some of us believe that we are just getting started, that Maker is ripe for hypergrowth, precisely what we want to achieve. The MKR we\u2019re asking for is no different than a startup raising Series A. Yes, it will dilute the token holders, but the goal of that dilution is the sought hypergrowth. The Slippery Slope Argument \u201cMinting MKR is a slippery slope.\u201d Governance will (arguably) always have the power to mint more tokens. A Decentralized Maximalist might argue that having the admin key to change the code is the beginning of the slippery slope. The slippery slope argument sounds more like a motion of no-confidence towards Governance. And it\u2019s by no means invalid. But if we do not trust Governance, we should frame it that way. The Social Contract MKR is burnt when things are going well and minted when needed. These needs might vary:  recover bad debt (we\u2019ve seen this in the past) raise funds to grow (we\u2019ve also seen this in the past; that\u2019s why we have investors)  It seems that we have forgotten the second need. The Market Value of Valuable Contributors Every single worker has a market value. Right now, the industry dictates that a given person will earn a given amount that might seem fair or not. For example, there is no shortage of projects that will take any Maker developer without blinking before lunchtime. Should every contributor get MKR tokens? Maybe not. We will need to decide as a Community how much we want to align to the industry and how much we choose to override. Base Salary versus Bonus Most have agreed that the \u201cbase salary\u201d should come from the surplus buffer to provide job security for the Maker contributors; some argue that any \u201cbonus\u201d should not. Usually, a worker will look at their total compensation package and decide if that is competitive or not. You can name each piece of the compensation however you want, but removing certainty to any of those parts will make the deal less attractive. An extreme implementation of that argument could hold that we should only pay minimum wage to our employees. Anything above that is a bonus that the contributor should only get if the Protocol is faring well. Making the total compensation package less certain will make our offers less competitive and hinder our capacity to attract talent. We should be worried about attracting the wrong talent: that is the actual slippery slope. If they are only here for the money, then\u2026 I have also heard that money should not be the primary factor for hiring someone. I think we all agree on that one. However, this should not mean that we need to underpay our contributors \u2014 much less not pay them at all. I don\u2019t want any core contributor to consider an external offer because we are not competitive. How about if instead of minting we\u2026 We need MKR that is readily available to compensate people. Minting seems to be the easiest, direct answer to solve this need. Any other creative solution seems to carry risks of slippage, front-running, or both. What\u2019s more, there might be risks attached to using elements such as the Surplus Buffer for things that are not intended. Things To Agree Should we burn the admin keys? First, we will need to agree on what type of project we are. Is this it? Have we achieved maturity? Do we let the burn bring value to the token holders? Should we consider burning the keys and ensure that Governance cannot change this (the code is the law) ? Do we want (hyper)growth? We need to decide if we want hypergrowth. To raise the required capital (MKR), we will need to mint. As an option, we might want to choose to be a bootstrapped project and only use the money we get from revenues. If that is the case, we need to be clear upfront about it and let contributors decide if they want to stay in a project with this constraint. Do we want an overarching framework? We probably don\u2019t want to have this same discussion every time a Core Unit comes up with some compensation scheme. Ideally, we can agree on something that we can reuse (and review from time to time). Framing a Framework General Framework   Do we align with the industry and compensate with tokens (MKR)?   What is the best way of obtaining these tokens? (reduce slippage, avoid front-running, etc.)   Do we want to include a vesting period, a cliff, and weighting (you get more on your fourth year than in your first)?   How often should we review this framework?   etc.   Specific Framework   Which teams/contributors get MKR tokens?   How much MKR should they get?   etc.   Edge Cases   What happens when a contributor changes Core Units?   etc.   Next Steps Discussion We will have a Community Call on Wednesday, 31st, to discuss these topics. Working Group We will probably need to form a working group to tackle this issue and present a decent framework to the Community and teams. Please write to me if you\u2019re interested.  Bonus: a diagram How much are we minting?  Minting Perspective1478\u00d7764 92.6 KB  If:  100 contributors (will we have that many?) at the suggested 0.1% rate (most will get less) stay for four years (turnover suggests it will be less)  Then we would be minting 10% of the total supply.

You speak in assumptions and hypotheticals while trying to nudge the \u201ccommunity\u201d in a certain direction. To me it sounds like Foundation members looking to \u201cdecentralize\u201d into the DAO have a plan in place to finally get some MKR compensation that the Foundation has been unable to adequately provide.

I was against minting from mostly just a PR perspective, in that I didn\u2019t want people vaguely familiar w/ Maker to look at us and dismiss MKR because we were diverting away from the deflationary value proposition. But at a certain point why should I let an uniformed opinion about MKR dictate the course of action? We should pursue what has the best chance to continue and extend Maker dominance in the crypto-credit space. To that end, it\u2019s pretty illogical to throw up fundamental objections to minting. We\u2019ve seen the MKR token over 4x in value in the last few months, perhaps we should be looking to companies like Tesla who capitalized on market perception by printing a budget. The buy and burn model can still be at the core of what we\u2019re building here, but especially at the true start of the DAO era I\u2019ve come around to the idea of minting. Decades from now I think MKR holders will be much better off because we decided to fund our growth fully up to needs rather than an arbitrary revenue projection.     juan:  We\u2019re growing pretty well already because the Foundation is paying the tab.   This is a pretty huge point that I ignored in my gut reaction to MKR minting. Without minting our \u201cwarchest\u201d is just what has been diverted to the SB, and from a risk perspective we really don\u2019t want to be drawing down that number. We\u2019ve appreciated all this growth because the Foundation had the ability to sell MKR into the market (not that different than minting when you think about it) and that has lead to us hitting nearly 3B DAI and and over 100M in annualized SFs. We should absolutely take caution when making the decision to inflate MKR, but as Juan so eloquently pointed out here, assuming we wouldn\u2019t take caution is the same as saying we don\u2019t have faith in Governance to do the right thing in the future. If that\u2019s the case, as someone looking to take on a serious role w/ GovAlpha, I\u2019d love to hear the concerns and what we can do to strengthen faith in Governance. ",

He said that 100m usd/year (which is what we currently get as a protocol without any MKR minting) is a lot to spend efficiently. I agree. I\u2019d be surprised if we actually need that much to grow effectively.     juan:   raise funds to grow (we\u2019ve also seen this in the past; that\u2019s why we have investors)  It seems that we have forgotten the second need.   I don\u2019t think any MKR was minted to fund growth. Simply, a large portion of the initial 1m MKR was assigned to growth, with a long term strategic decision. Starting with 1m, with say 300k planned to be sold for growth, is not the same as starting with 700k and then eventually minting 300k for growth when needed. The community largely supported the stopping of MKR-burning, to create a buffer of 30 millions. So the community is not trying to stop growth at all. But I suspect this \u2018Hypergrowth\u2019 is mostly a way to just print MKR for Core Unit contributors. I think MakerDAO should fund growth just with the profits it makes: >100m/year.     juan:  Should every contributor get MKR tokens? Maybe not. We will need to decide as a Community how much we want to align to the industry and how much we choose to override.   I think we had enough community discussion with hundreds of posts, following the SC Core Unit budget proposal. At the end, the MKR voters will decide (many MKR do not belong to the people discussing in this forum). So perhaps after 1 month of discussions in the forum, which doesn\u2019t seem to go anywhere,it is perhaps time to ask the MKR holders what they think about MKR minting. @juan thanks for this nice post. I think somebody should try to run a onchain poll to see what is the sentiment of the people that are actually going to decide (MKR whales). ",

There\u2019s a saying that says \u201chalf of my marketing works; the problem is that I do not know which half\u201d. It\u2019s quite hard to remove pieces that are not growth-related.

So if the Foundation dissolves without commenting (maybe they just want to hold for the next 10 years) you are proposing to actually not have this conversation at all? Are you also against a framework for this topic? Or you are suggesting we should also ignore the request by the Smart Contracts team (and potentially the other Core Units coming after that)? We might lose a couple of Core Contributors along the way and send a strong message out there. Is that what we want to do? I\u2019m happy to assess the framework (and this discussion) once we have any new piece of information (including what is the Foundation doing with all its MKR). This discussion doesn\u2019t seem premature to me \u2013 it seems long overdue.  (*) Including this one, of course. ",

                    "content": "Here is what I wrote to @SebVentures in Rocket Chat PM and would essentially be my proposal/opinion for MKR minting: I think the biggest thing is making sure MKR is still deflationary long term and making sure we all agree to this philosophy. So short term it\u2019s ok if we mint a bit for incentives but overall we should ensure that the supply is still going down. I think whoever can come up with a solid proposal that addresses these issues will garner a lot of support. So we have to define what is an acceptable amount of minting based on current and projected revenues vs MKR price appreciation. It\u2019s a bit of guess work but as long as we stay conservative with the minting we should be ok. For instance we can estimate that MKR burn would be at a minimum 1-3% annually and then if we know Core Unit expenses we can get to a rough number of MKR we can accept as minting so that we are still net deflationary. So lets say revenues EoY are 200M, Core Unit expenses are 20M, and price of MKR is 5k. So Revenues are 180M/5K MKR = 36k MKR to be burned. Let\u2019s ignore surplus buffer for this calculation as long term I don\u2019t think it matters in price calculation. So you have ~3.6% deflation and we agree to mint 10% of that or 3600 to be split between Core Units and other incentive programs for the next year. This is obviously just an example of the possibilities. Know that I have no idea how much expenses are going to be and so could be more than 100M. These are just rough guesses for illustrative purposes. Next you\u2019d need to agree to the allocation of these MKR based on Core Unit importance or perhaps during the budget proposal the Core Units know how much is allocated by governance and can then vie for a percentage of the pot knowing that certain Core Units \u201cdeserve\u201d more. Something along those lines. Alternatively, governance agreeing to a yearly inflation of x% for incentives and then Core Units vying for that may be a simpler option. ",

Personally, I would be more comfortable if governance made that determination (how to split annual / quarterly incentives) rather than the Core Units having to sort it out. From what I can tell those options are mutually exclusive though. Either you mint a fixed amount for incentives and have a zero sum game, or you mint an unfixed amount and you have a non-zero sum game. ",

                    "content": "Alright fair enough. So agree to mint 1% of circulating supply per year and whatever surplus we have can get burned during the year. So 10k available for incentives (Core Units, yield farming, voting). Smart contracts asked for 3400 over 4 years? So give them 10% of the 10k? It should be based on individuals not teams though so if a team that is more \u201cimportant\u201d deserves more MKR how do they get a larger percentage? Or should the DAI compensation be based on competitive salaries in the industry and then MKR compensation should just be even across individuals? I guess whenever a new employee is onboarded the facilitator would have to request a new vesting contract for that individual. I\u2019m still thinking higher risk Core Units should get more MKR allocation because they can mess up the protocol more. Some ideas to flesh out more.     LongForWisdom:  Either you mint a fixed amount for incentives and have a zero sum game, or you mint an unfixed amount and you have a non-zero sum game.   I don\u2019t think you want to have an unfixed amount. That\u2019s where you get into slippery slope territory and end up printing 50% of supply just because people are asking for it (and I don\u2019t think current MKR holders would go for that). Having a fixed supply/allocation determined by governance is the only way I see this getting past whales. You can still leave lot\u2019s of room for flexibility as long as the pool is large enough and MKR holders stay competent in setting these parameters. However this starts to get complicated and I know a few people that want to minimize protocol complexity, not increase it. Having some combination of fixed/predetermined inflation based on data, paired with a pre-determined framework for said inflation is what will win (in my opinion). ",

I think the latter option is strictly preferable to us than wasting a bunch of money on slippage due to a misunderstanding of the token\u2019s social contract. If expenses is greater than incomes, the MKR token is inflationary. If incomes are greater than expenses, then it is deflationary. This is how the system has always been designed to work. If personnel costs are some reasonable amount, the token will continue to deflate over time. If personnel costs are significantly more than revenues, then I guess something has gone very wrong. ",

I will mainly summarize what I understood and fill in some holes. One important point is the idea to have a limited budget for workforce expenses. This is probably for the best. This provides a constraint and incentivizes Core Unit to limit their size to the best efficiency. Let\u2019s say Governance decides to allocate $50M to the workforce for the near future (one year). This can be split into 25M DAI and 12k MKR. The DAI part would be the base salary (defined using market price). The MKR part could be allocated using a split where every worker has a weight on it (contributor vs facilitator, core core unit vs non-core core unit, \u2026). This removes the MKR minting issue more or less. Governance has decided to an annual budget and if earnings are not enough, well you end up with a net MKR issuance. You can decide to express everything in DAI as well and said the equity part is $25M to be split no matter the price of MKR. There are pros and cons. It\u2019s not super important. I personally prefer the MKR option as a Core Unit facilitator and as a MKR holder. You get/pay more if MKR increase but that also good for MKR holders. And it decreases the cost/dilution if there is a DeFi winter. The base budget (the first 25M DAI) is a limit for Governance to not spend too much and agree on everything (even if only a gentleman agreement), the second part is a fixed incentive that avoids the complexity of managing MKR issuance. It decreases as the protocol grows and you don\u2019t end up with 1000 employees that want each 0.1% of MKR (hey that\u2019s 100%). Core Units facilitators will have to coordinate to have a good expectation to provide to their contributors. Remains some questions:  Is $50M a good number? I just took 100M of annual revenues and left some room for securing the protocol by growing the Surplus Buffer. 50% for fueling the growth and 50% to secure the growth (assuming we target 0 net MKR issuance). Do you count gas expenses in it? I would say so. Anything that is non directly correlated to growth should be in it. Obviously, you count $3M for gas and it might end up between $1M and $20M at the end of the year, that\u2019s the difference between a budget and the reality (the budgeted target being expressed in gas price).  I think this is fair to everyone. ",

To raise the required capital (MKR), we will need to mint.   Highly interesting. A choice between hypergrowth or not. Could you please provide a link to the specific proposal that will ensure this hypergrowth and how much MKR is needed? At the moment Maker bandwidth is approximately onboarding 2-3 collateral types per month and you are suggesting this will improve to the point of hypergrowth if MKR is handed out as a bonus?     juan:  Should we burn the admin keys? First, we will need to agree on what type of project we are. Is this it? Have we achieved maturity?   So it is hypergrowth or burn the admin keys? I have followed Maker since 2016 and not once have I heard anyone even jokingly implying the admin keys should be burned. In my estimate there is at least  a decade of coding left and given the speed of defi development it is quite possibly Maker will never be finished.     juan:   100 contributors (will we have that many?) at the suggested 0.1% rate (most will get less) stay for four years (turnover suggests it will be less)  Then we would be minting 10% of the total supply.   No we won\u2019t. Because - as you write yourself - turnover suggest most people leave before the 4 year period is over. The new folks coming in will want the same deal - which is why MKR will keep getting printed.     juan:  But if we do not trust Governance, we should frame it that way.   I trust Gov alright - to a certain extent. All people involved should ask themselves why Bitcoin of all projects have such a enormous market cap. The answer, if we take away the name value and history, is that it is nearly inconceivably for any one individual or even any group to mess up the protocol to such an extent that other people cannot make a recovery. No bitcoin core dev or gov group ever prints BTC, that is a central part of the value proposition. I am not suggesting Maker has reached this stage yet, and I am not a anti-print maximalist, but any printing of MKR will need to come hand in hand with countermeasures to hinder future printing for any other reason than to keep the protocol above water. It is very hard to be just a little bit pregnant. I am sorry if I come across as a bit harsh on this topic. EDIT: typos ",

I know, though, that they are not ill-intended.     Planet_X:  bandwidth is approximately onboarding 2-3 collateral types per month and you are suggesting this will improve to the point of hypergrowth if MKR is handed out as a bonus    If we only keep onboarding 2-3 collateral types per month we will grow at a relatively predictable pace. However, we will be limited by the size of the collateral types we onboard.

I think that we\u2019re quite committed to give it our best shot though.      Planet_X:  I have followed Maker since 2016 and not once have I heard anyone even jokingly implying the admin keys should be burned. In my estimate there is at least a decade of coding left   Maybe an hyperbole was not the best idea, but it does convey the argument. I fully agree. I do not think that we should burn anything (except for MKR).     Planet_X:  I trust Gov alright - to a certain extent.   I\u2019m not asking for a carte blanche to print. Right now there is a group that wants to hire the best talent and grow Maker way more (we\u2019re just getting started). There is another group that says that we should cap the expenses to our revenues. Once we decide which group we are in, we can start planning accordingly. But they are very different ways of running a project.     Planet_X:  which is why MKR will keep getting printed.   If we get 100 contributors at 0.1% and they left after 1 year, we would have minted 2.5% (assuming linear vesting). So when the new 100 contributors arrive, you still have 7.5% of the original deal to mint. ",

                    "content": "@juan, I love what you do, and your post is definitely stirring the pot here. If anything, I view this post as a \u201cDevil\u2019s Advocate.\u201d This conversation must be had. A lot has already been said on this topic, so I\u2019ll try to cover some of what I think is worth considering.  First, where I stand:  We NEED to be competitive to retain talent. I am pro-vesting. Compensating devs/contributors w/ vested MKR, A LOT of MKR, is a must.  Crude as it was, @kevinwildenradt and I did propose MIP42.   Minting is not inherently evil. I am vehemently against minting without strict, clearly defined, codified constraints.  What I mean is, minting beyond the point of dilution.   Minting to dilution is a non-starter for me.  I will vote against it.   We need a clearly defined CU standardized framework, even if it means delaying the rollout of CUs. Vesting MKR should be voted on by the DAO for how much each CU receives.  I hope we are adult enough to not battle over scraps of who gets how much and can calmly accept the Maker governance community\u2019s decisions.   MKR for vesting should ideally be set aside and reserved for CU teams ahead of their respective launches, likely open to monthly/quarterly/annual review. From where and how we obtain that MKR is the open debate.  @SebVentures G-Sheet is awesome.   So, I have a few key premises:  People suck. Humans have cognitive biases. MKR governance is composed of people. The printer button\u2019s temptation is too powerful for any mere mortal to resist.  I do not care who you are\u2026 if the printer button is there, you will press it. No one, no matter their willpower or moral alignment, will resist the printer button on an indefinite timeline. We will come up with any and every \"reasonable\" justification to use it. Grow the team, retain talent, fund development, form partnerships\u2026 you name it. I don\u2019t have an issue with minting per se. If, from a technical, market standpoint, it makes more sense to mint rather than use the surplus to acquire MKR and redistribute. So be it. The issue, as I see it, is minting freely to incentivize \u201cpromises\u201d of future growth\u2026 and minting above our means (i.e., minting more than we burn) hoping that the growth incentivized by minting will outpace the dilution effect. This path has already been traveled. We know where it leads. I will argue this point til death. We are all human at the end of the day and are all susceptible to the typical cognitive biases that come with that. We need a system with a proper incentive structure that does not allow for bad (or stupid) actors to be able to make bad decisions. We need to think hard for another way. We must set strict constraints and work within those bounds. If we lose some talent as a result, it will be a tragedy, but I would much rather we retain the talent that is passionate about Maker and understands the power and future of MakerDAO.  We are the industry leader and the role model for the entire space. We must lead by example.  If we choose to go down the path of unrestricted minting for XYZ, we WILL devolve into a mess where everyone will be looking to vote for themselves to receive minted MKR in one way or another. I, myself, will become a proponent of minting. If we are minting\u2026 I WANT IN. You better be printing to me for staking my vote. You better print to me for any and every reason. Fuck those ppl who aren\u2019t participating. Snooze, you lose\u2026 but you better print to ME!  This is NOT who I am at heart, but that\u2019s what this incentive structure will lead me to become.  I am largely with @Planet_X:  I am not suggesting Maker has reached this stage yet, and I am not an anti-print maximalist, but any printing of MKR will need to come hand in hand with countermeasures to hinder future printing for any other reason than to keep the protocol above water. It is very hard to be just a little bit pregnant.   The Big Unanswered Question: The Future of The Foundation Treasury This remains the largest unanswered question, and imo, is perhaps one of the most important factors for this discussion. I fully understand that this is a touchy subject, and for legal reasons, we may not know the answer for a while. As touchy as it may be\u2026 the time has come to touch it. Once the foundation dissolves:  Will the MKR be burned?  Then we can freely mint up to the burn amount, reserve that MKR for the DAO treasury, and ration out MKR as needed for years to come. The minting issue becomes moot.   Will the MKR be transferred to the DAO treasury?  We can reserve that MKR and ration out MKR as needed for years to come. The minting issue becomes moot.   Will the MKR be donated?  No idea what to do in this case.   Will the MKR be disbursed to friends and foundation members?  I\u2019d rate the odds of that at near-zero\u2026 but again, no idea what to do in this case.   Will the MKR be disbursed equally to all MKR holders after some snapshot?  Maybe this puts us back to a minting against revenue scenario.   Will the MKR be disbursed equally to all MKR holders that have locked their MKR in the voting contract after some snapshot?  Maybe this puts us back to a minting against revenue scenario.   Will there be some other plans for that MKR?  We\u2019ll have to see what happens and adapt accordingly.    Depending on how this unfolds, we may have to completely readjust all of our plans for minting and vesting schedules.  TLDR:  Let\u2019s not be irresponsible. Let\u2019s pause and think about whether or how much we really truly need to be minting. I know this is a hard transition. We are all strong, intelligent, and passionate pioneers. We can get by without abusing the printer button. Resist the temptation at all costs. The entire industry is looking up to us. Let\u2019s set the right example. Let\u2019s not repeat the same mistakes that have plagued the traditional world for millennia.   Side Note:  I have no idea what burning the admin keys entails, so I won\u2019t place a strong opinion there. That said, intuitively, it doesn\u2019t seem like the play.

However I am interested in the discussion being based on facts (which can be rather complex) rather than unsourced blanket statements. From an accounting perspective, stock-based compensation is an expense. Yet it is also very useful to companies because it requires no cash \u2013 shares are in fact issued for compensation (according to e.g. corporatefinanceinstitute.com). Whether a company is overall increasing or reducing its outstanding shares count is the outcome of higher-level strategies; whether a company will or will not buy back stock depends on its capital opportunities, its internal evaluation of the current share price, etc. Providing MKR as compensation should be done (or not done) based on rather tricky tradeoffs we have to think through, regarding our image, the market for talent, the market reaction to issuance, etc. Not based on whether it puts us in some imagined \u201chas no cash\u201d bucket or constrained by the fact that we must buy those MKR.

However, the long term trend in Apple\u2019s share repurchases is clear.  Apple shares outstanding for the quarter ending December 31, 2020 were 17.114B, a 3.96% decline year-over-year. Apple 2020 shares outstanding were 17.528B, a 5.74% decline from 2019. Apple 2019 shares outstanding were 18.596B, a 7.02% decline from 2018. Apple 2018 shares outstanding were 20B, a 4.79% decline from 2017.  A company\u2019s decision to buy back shares is completely separate from the stock compensation employees receive and is based on capital allocation. If a company is buying their own shares back, it is because they believe it is providing the highest ROI vs alternatives, namely reinvesting in the base business. If executives and employees are receiving stock compensation, it is because the value they bring to the business exceeds such costs which the market dictates.  Amazon shares outstanding for the quarter ending December 31, 2020 were 0.510B, a 1.19% increase year-over-year. Amazon 2020 shares outstanding were 0.51B, a 1.19% increase from 2019.

I post these to illustrate that investment returns are not dictated by a decision to buy back from or dilute shareholders, but long term free cash flow which is derived from effective capital allocation. I understand that Maker was built and intended to be net deflationary over time. This is great in theory and long-term is an ideal model in my opinion, but only when MakerDAO\u2019s growth has slowed and the expected ROI from the buy-back exceeds all other investment and capital allocation opportunities.

However, the long term trend in Apple\u2019s share repurchases is clear.   Thanks, @Aes, for your well-researched answer. I was not trying to imply that AAPL is issuing shares long-term. I was just showing a cash-rich company that, in fact, issues shares. Just a quick counter example. I think @SebVentures was much more eloquent than me, and also pointed out this:     Aes:  A company\u2019s decision to buy back shares is completely separate from the stock compensation employees receive and is based on capital allocation.   Finally, I really like how you framed this:     Aes:  I post these to illustrate that investment returns are not dictated by a decision to buy back from or dilute shareholders, but long term free cash flow which is derived from effective capital allocation. I understand that Maker was built and intended to be net deflationary over time.

We would have to model out annual expenses and worst case scenarios to determine how much of a treasury to carry, but in my opinion this is an easy win to provide stability to CU\u2019s and ensure MKR doesn\u2019t get minted at low prices/unfavorable market conditions.

MKR governance is composed of people. The printer button\u2019s temptation is too powerful for any mere mortal to resist.    Only two of these are correct.  People suck - No they don\u2019t, on average humans cooperate more often than they defect. If this wasn\u2019t true, civilisation wouldn\u2019t exist. Humans have cognitive biases - Yes. MKR governance is composed of people. - Yes. The printer button\u2019s temptation is too powerful for any mere mortal to resist. - Eh, I disagree, but no one mortal has the ability to push it, so it\u2019s more or less beside the point.      aburban90:  No one, no matter their willpower or moral alignment, will resist the printer button on an indefinite timeline.   No one mortal has the ability to push it. What matters is whether multiple mortals can convince each other that it is a good idea.     aburban90:  and minting above our means (i.e., minting more than we burn) hoping that the growth incentivized by minting will outpace the dilution effect. This path has already been traveled. We know where it leads.   This choice is always a gamble. It can end well, it can end badly. It depends on the usage of the funds, but it isn\u2019t inherently a bad choice, it is a risky choice. No one knows where it leads in any individual instance until it leads there.     aburban90:  We must set strict constraints and work within those bounds.   We cannot set hard-coded constraints. Governance cannot bind its own future actions in this way from a technical standpoint - not in a way that allows the protocol to still operate with MKR as the backstop to the system.     aburban90:  If we choose to go down the path of unrestricted minting for XYZ, we WILL devolve into a mess where everyone will be looking to vote for themselves to receive minted MKR in one way or another.   This is a slippery slope argument that isn\u2019t justified. Why is it unreasonable to say that governance might vote in favour of minting for Core Unit alignment and incentives, but would not vote in favour of minting for individuals? Why is it certain that governance cannot use minting judiciously, especially when it already does so? We\u2019re debating where the line is, not whether or not the line exists. We know there is a line, because we currently mint MKR in order to recapitalize DAI and prevent the death of the protocol. Ultimately there are different ways to die. We might die fast or we might die slow. Minting MKR to recapitalize the system is an example of using MKR mint to prevent dying fast. Minting MKR to pay salaries in DAI (in the absence of other funds) is another example of using MKR mint to prevent dying fast. Dying slow is much harder to see coming, and much harder to reason about, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t a threat. Some tools are dangerous. Often the most useful tools are the most dangerous. Arguing that the tool is so dangerous that we cannot touch it prevents both positive and negative outcomes of its use. ",

Reserved shares are often referred to as the \u201cunallocated option pool\u201d or the \u201cpool.\u201d The unallocated option pool is not considered issued and outstanding.
