In the first week 0.25% gathered 72K MKR backing it (99.5% of votes) while in the second week there was a split between 0% and 0.25% with 0.25% narrowly winning. In both cases nearly 100% of the vote went to the 0% and 0.25% options which leads me to believe MKR holders want to keep the DSR close to the MCD SF on an ongoing basis. In order to reduce the effort required for engaged voters, I propose we reduce the frequency of the DSR Spread governance poll. I\u2019ve listed some options below:     Keep the DSR Spread poll frequency at 1 per week One DSR Spread poll per 2 weeks One DSR Spread poll per 3 weeks One DSR Spread poll per 1 month One DSR Spread poll per 2 months One DSR Spread poll per 3 months Abstain (I want to see results) Abstain (I have no opinion) Abstain (I don\u2019t feel I am knowledgable on the subject) Abstain (I disagree with the poll options) Abstain (I have a different objection)     0 voters     This is a multiple choice poll, vote for  everything  you are willing to vote for in an on-chain vote.

                    "content": "There is one thing that could happen with a fixed % of the SF going to the DSR. As @SamM commented in another discussion we had regarding this coupling of the DSR to the SF via the DSR-SPREAD he has a real concern about the DSR rate going above the SF rate as this would cause people to max out the debt limit. One could easily see a situation where using a fixed % of the SF going to the DSR to lead to an effective DSR rate that is higher than the GSF.   (I looked at these scenarios and think they are managable if the rates are set to a utilization curve both on the borrow and supply sides.) I have some other issues regarding system control variables being grouped that can lead to similar unexpected operational hazards.   Example is using the DSR-SPREAD.    Lets say the DSR-SPREAD is 4% and the SF is 8%.    Dropping the SF to anything below 4% would REQUIRE the DSR-SPREAD to change otherwise the DSR rate would come up negative in such a governance vote. Which leads to a suggestion for governance no matter how these are polled for.  List governance changes and then the actual operational changes they are going to exhibit in the governance poll. Example SF 10%, DSR-SPREAD 2% means SF 10% and DSR 8%.   In the case  I give above where the SF is 8% and the DSR-SPREAD is 4% that if in the list of polling options for SF below 4% and DSR-SPREAD 4% that this would lead to a negative DSR rate and hence are invalid choices. It is exactly these kinds of details that people have to keep in mind when coupling important system variables, as ignoring that the DSR will change when the SF changes, may lead to unintended and unexpected system or behavioral consequences.  I am considering making a seperate post on this. My point here is that even with SF at 8% and DSR at 4% there could be a very real difference between lowing the SF from 8-4% that is vastly different than lowering the DSR from 4%-0% at the same time.   Contrast this same situation with the SF at 12%, DSR-Spread at 4% (SF=12, DSR=8) and lowering the SF to 8% (SF=8, DSR=4).   This 4% SF drop acts very differently as one lowers the DSR to 0 the other by 50% to 4%. ",

Due to \u201cOne DSR Spread poll per 2 weeks\u201d coming in with 50% of the vote I had to make a choice between 2 options:  Run a governance poll with the normal Yes/No question. Run a governance poll with 3 options of 2 weeks, 1 month and status quo.  I opted for option 1 as option 2 runs the risk of a minority status quo vote incorrectly taking the win. This would happen in the case where the majority wants a DSR Spread reduction, but the Yes vote gets split such that status quo wins out. Ideally, I wanted to run this as a ranked choice poll to solve the problem of the vote split, but we do not have support for that (yet). I will be making a new thread soon to gather support for adding ranked choice to the governance portal in cases such as this where it is a clear win. Here is a description of the vote for @rich.brown to add to the voting portal:  Title: Should we reduce the frequency of the DSR Spread governance poll to once per month?

Who am I to make this unilateral decision? I talked it over with @LongForWisdom and he gave me the view that since the poll is multiple choice it is not so much this option vs that option, but more the options that the majority are most okay with. Personally I don\u2019t really like any of these decisions and would prefer ranked voting with 3 choices. I would say that if people don\u2019t like my unilateral decision on this then by all means vote no. I don\u2019t think this is a particularly contentious vote. If 1 / month is too infrequent we can always raise it again. I would like to make ranked choice available in the future to solve this type of problem. This is definitely not going to be the last poll with no clear winner. EDIT: Maybe a temporary alternative can be to run 2 polls? Status Quo vs DSR Spread Frequency Reduction and the second poll being 2 weeks vs 1 month. ",

Given that one is slightly ahead, it makes sense to me to favor that one (even if the margin is small) I presented a couple of options for this:  One poll on-chain with both consensus options and the status quo. One poll on-chain with the highest consensus option vs the status quo. Have a second forum poll which was single choice between 2 weeks vs. 1 month to determine which the community favors.  Sams\u2019s suggestion to have two on-chain polls is a fourth option that I didn\u2019t consider. In my view Option 2 is still best here. The way to read the outcome of this poll is that over half of the community are happy to move to either a 2 week or 1 month cadence for the DSR poll. Since slightly more of the community are happy with a 1 month cadence, this is the option that is most likely to pass in an on-chain vote, and is therefore the option that should move on-chain. Putting both on-chain would set a precedent that I am slightly unsure about. What is the rule we would be following:  All options with greater than 50% go on-chain in some form? Options go on-chain if they are either win, or are \u2018close to the winner\u2019?  Would we still be advocating for both to go on-chain if one option had 70% and the other 50%? Probably not, imo, we would go for 70%. Which means rule 1 is a bit sketchy.  Rule 2 also seems sketchy for what I hope are obvious reasons. In this situation it may have been wiser to extend the poll for some time and attempt to bring a higher level of consensus to one of the >50% options. Obviously this has the downside of taking longer and asking for additional engagement though. ",

This brings into question where the threshold is determined to be and who gets to decide that. The one thing I continue to come back to is the fact that these votes are such a small subset of the actual voters that I worry about how that translates to on-chain actions. By this I mean I\u2019m not sure the forum votes will always be representative of what MKR voters ultimately want/decide. By keeping the most options open we can give MKR voters the greatest breadth of options while at the same time culling the options that are the most unpopular. I\u2019m not sure what the golden rule on all this should be but I\u2019m sure these conversations will continue evolving and as it stands right now it seems to be somewhat up to the poll creators discretion.

In my view the forum poll consensus is a very rough mechanism to see what people like. There is no Sybil protection, and I don\u2019t think we will be protected by good will forever. I think trying to come up with some rigid criteria that specifies what should and shouldn\u2019t go on chain is not particularly helpful.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 24 at 5 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, February 28, at 5 PM UTC.  ## Review  This proposal was discussed in the [forums](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-reduce-the-frequency-of-the-dsr-spread-governance-poll/1207).

This seems like a reasonable precedent to set: If there are multiple options with a majority greater than or equal to 50%, they should be put on-chain consecutively, ordered by size of majority (highest to lowest) until one one of the on-chain polls passes. We could think about doing these simultaneously in the future, but for the time being, the above precedent seems reasonable. If anyone has any comments on this, please feel free to discuss. ",
