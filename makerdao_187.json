                    "content": " General Updates  Institutional Vaults. In a coordinated effort between different Core Units, we are close to the launch of the Nexo IV. It has been an exciting process that allowed us to work together with potential IV users and the Maker Community. These are our learnings of that process:  Governance reward tokens are very attractive for borrowers, not just because they directly reduce fees but also because the rewards are available capital for them. Although we can\u2019t compete with that (for now at least), we offer increasing capital efficiency by predictable rates. The nature of the protocol (it\u2019s not a pool, and everyone mints new Dai using their assets) is a huge difference from the other lending pools in the market. And an important advantage, because it\u2019s easy to trace the origin of funds, and also the limit of Dai liquidity depends on the collaterals and not on the size of the pools. As more TradFi companies are interested in DeFi, new companies will want to try out the protocol, and we need more content to explain to these risk and compliance teams (not crypto teams) how Maker works. We have to check all the integration points these institutions use to access the protocol are working as expected. If not, they won\u2019t be interested in using the protocol. As we mentioned before, there are some legal challenges with these TradFi companies. We are working on it, and we expect to give you updates on this matter soon. PSM as an on-off board solution for DAI is super powerful We have to keep improving IV terms and the process.  Thanks to everyone who contributed to this process!

                    "content": " General Updates  Institutional Vaults IV has been helping us to initiate conversations with companies with large crypto treasuries to explain to them what\u2019s happening with Maker. It\u2019s easy for them to not pay that much attention, and to get distracted by the rewards other protocols offer, and not be aware of the lowest stability fees and opportunities Maker has. One to one communication with our users has been an interesting process that allowed us to:   The objective with Nexo\u2019s IV is to mint up to 1.5B DAI from ETH and wBTC, increasing the Dai backed by decentralized tokens. When we started conversations with them, Nexo had a 200m DAI position, and by today they have a 1.3B DAI position.   Celcius increased their position from a 38m DAI position to a 225m DAI position.   It is helping us to understand the challenges institutions have when interacting with Maker:     We discovered that Fireblocks for institutions was not working well with Oasis. Now we are working with the FB team and PECU to solve that problem.   We are having conversations with other institutional custodians so they can integrate maker vaults.   Although the Polygon -Matic- vault is not an IV, we knew the primary user for the vault was going to be the Polygon team. They have been having issues with the DC-IAM because of the efforts to coordinate their multi-sig signers to approve each transaction and then wait for the DC to increase. We also had a similar situation with the USDP PSM, in this case, the user didn\u2019t understand how the DC-IAM worked.   We have been educating the compliance and legal team of those institutions on how is Maker different from a lending pool and the implications of being a DAO.    A strong Maker ecosystem Our strategy is to create long-term relationships with our partners. Because of that, we proposed to the community to add new stablecoins to the PSM after discussing how both teams (Maker and the stablecoin) could find benefits from that integration.
