                    "content": " Introducing v2 of the Steward Council & future plans  tl;dr This update seeks to inform the community about the results of a Steward Council v1 retroactive assessment, outline key priority areas for v2 of the Steward Council, and to announce the members of the Steward Council for the next 180 days. For background, you can explore the initial proposal introducing the Steward Council here, as well as the The Steward Council - Formation & Mandate  here. This update is split into the following sections:  Steward Council v1 Retroactive Announcing members of the v2 Stewards Council   Steward Council v1 Retroactive results The Steward Council was authorized via the The Steward Council Election & Mandate snapshot vote on March 11, 2022 for 180 days. As the period closes on September 7, 2022, and to prepare for the next session, a retro was conducted to capture lessons learned and identify areas of improvement. The results are captured in this slide deck, but can be summarized in terms of what was done well, and what work still needs to be completed. Data was collected via one-on-one interviews, a qualitative survey, and a 1 hour review with the Stewards Council. The data collected, the input from the surveys, as well as a recording of the working group are all captured in the slide deck. What worked well:  We found a way to judiciously get the right people on the council We built a respectful and professional group to debate difficult topics We delivered a container and cadence for getting to a workable budget The team standardized the budget building process making a big difference We were able to identify the most important concerns  One of the key outputs from the retro was to identify what work still needed to be done, and what (if any) adjustments still need to be made. Through the discussions and a quick voting mechanism - we identified the list below: The work to be completed:  Continue refining/simplifying the budgeting process Clarify and optimize how members roll in and out of the Stewards council Migrate topics to \u201cboard level\u201d strategic discussions vs. tactical recommendations Update and refine the mandate of the Steward council, incl remuneration of its members Revise the steward health cards & Steward Council selection algorithm  Additionally, it should be noted that DAO Operation have identified the following related OKRs which will be delivered by the Governance team during Season 15:  KR1: Create a clearly understood onboarding and incentivization process. KR2: Launch a Governance Documentation Hub for new and existing stewards. KR3: 80% of stewards and workstream leads view steward meeting structure, pacing and content favorably. KR4: 80% of top stewards vote on 100% of formal S15 proposals.   Announcing members of the v2 Stewards Council Recall this council looks to elevate the participation of the most engaged stewards as exemplified by the engagement scorecards and looking at stewards with a rating above 8/10. There have been no changes in the Steward Council selection methodology for now. For background, the current methodology is documented here and revised here. In future, we do plan to continue improving the steward health cards including proposals related to the Steward Council selection process, but no changes were made in this selection. The current lineup of Stewards with scores of 8/10 or over during the past 180 days is as follows:  DisruptionJoe kyle Fishbiscuit @bobjiang @lefterisjp @Pop @krrisis @linda @Jodi_GitcoinDAO @Sirlupinwatson @David_Dyor @tjayrush @ZER8  This second Steward Council will be active until March 06, 2023 following the 180 day period as laid out in this original post. This Council will take us through the end of Season 16, and comfortably into Season 17 before transition. If there are any adjustments to the current format or mandate, those changes will be brought to a community vote. Finally, we would like to express our appreciation and gratitude to all the Stewards for their contributions to our first Council - both those who will remain on the Council, and those who are departing. You developed a professional working group that has made a significant contribution to the success of Gitcoin, and we thank you. We are looking forward to your comments. If you are interested in becoming a Steward and potentially joining the next Stewards council, you can apply here. ",

The selection of the Seward Council is an algorithm - a basic calculation of a persons average governance & Gitcoin participation over the past 6 months. the calculation is: V0.7 + F_t1.1 + F_t_p1.5 + F_p0.7 + F_p_p*1 + W Where: V = Vote participation on Snapshot (only proposals with >0.5M GTC are counted) F_t = Forum Topics initiated (excluding the \u201cProposal Discussion\u201d category) F_t_p = Forum Topics initiated in the \u201cProposal Discussion\u201d category F_p = Forum posts (excluding the \u201cProposal Discussion\u201d category) F_p_p = Forum posts in the \u201cProposal Discussion\u201d category W = Workstream involvement. Lead role adds 5p and contributor adds 3p to health. This new 180 day look back view can be seen in here - and this 180 day look back view will be added to the standard daostewards.xyz site shortly.

One of the improvement areas we identified in the Retro was how Stewards move on, and off of the Council.  Given anyone can stop participation at any point, we would do well to build an offboarding process, triggers for that process, and what we should do if participation were to fall below a specific level.

                    "content": "Hey all! Thanks for putting this together, I think it\u2019s a really great starting point. One thing I noticed that the current council only reflects a couple of workstreams (mainly FDD and DAO Ops) and misses quite a few highly active stewards. As @kyle noted some folks are also no longer working for the DAO although they may have been when the snapshot was taken. Especially given that we\u2019re talking about this council being in place for a relatively long period (180 days) I\u2019d like to propose an amended selection process, based on the success we\u2019ve seen in CSDO and other governance bodies. In fact, we could view \u201cSC\u201d as principally guiding strategic decisions while \u201cCS\u201d guides tactical ones. Take this as just one option as we continue to iterate towards the best possible stewards council. Step 1: Workstream Nomination. Each workstream nominates (via any process they see fit, one lead for each meeting (monthly). They are required to have prepared a list of key strategy questions (e.g. fraud might ask \u2018should we have an open data service that helps us streamline Sybil data analysis\u2019; PGF might ask \u2018what kinds of rounds should the program run that it isn\u2019t thinking about and why\u2019; GPC might ask \u2018how do we ensure we\u2019re building best with the community\u2019). Workstreams risk slashing if they don\u2019t come through with these questions consistently. Step 2a Steward Nomination, Each workstream nominates at most 3 stewards to go into a pool. Each steward must be a non-active workstream member (i.e. an \u201cindependent\u201d member). This allows us to bring in folks that can provide strong external guidance and relevant domain expertise that might not be present internally. We can also require that selected stewards meet some threshold of activity or delegation. Step 2b: Steward Nomination. Chosen stewards go into a QV, and workstreams nominate 3 members each to vote. We can even dogfood our own quadratic voting site for this. Step 3: Ratification. We elect that council in a forum post + snapshot vote as usual. Crucially, if at any time someone needs to step down we can simply use the previous vote rankings to determine who might take their place. IMO this wouldn\u2019t take very long to organize and might yield better results than relying mainly on the health cards. For context, I originally designed the health cards as a way to track total steward engagement, but didn\u2019t necessarily intend for it to be used in this kind of election process when I first conceived of it (though I think it\u2019s a good input). Would love any thoughts and feedback on this approach. ",

As I surveyed existing steward council members, it became clear that the objectives of SC need deeper clarification.     ceresstation:  In fact, we could view \u201cSC\u201d as principally guiding strategic decisions while \u201cCS\u201d guides tactical ones.   The mechanism for deciding who is on the council is important, but if we are not clear on what the council does, the what will be invented by the who.   We will get a result, but not sure if it will be the right result. Most all the feedback I saw agrees with your assessment that we need to move the SC to a strategic posture, and I think we can afford to be a bit descriptive here.  I sent a draft proposal over to @krrisis on a proposal that addresses 1) what the council should, and should not do 2) council renumeration and 3) how we decide who is on the council - which is a copy past of your proposal above.

We will get a result, but not sure if it will be the right result.   As some people may know, I\u2019m quite passionate about Gitcoin DAO and what it could grow into. IMHO(as a person that worked and joined over 10 daos, all with over 1 m$ in funding and with more than 100 members each) I can subjectivelly say that we are one of \u201cthe flagship DAOs\u201d in the space. We are not perfect and kinda face some of the issues that all DAOs face, BUT what could differentiate us(on a DAO level) could be the solutions that we implement to overcome those barriers. Constructive creativity bares a huge role here. I also think that conflict management should be included in the convo. I sometimes feel that people run away from conflict, but conflict should be discussed in a safe space because this is not a zero sum game, but a positive sum one=> meaning that both parties could end up winning if the \u201cconflict\u201d is managed properly. What can I say\u2026It\u2019s just incredibly exciting to see what the SC will grow into  and how it could forever shape the quadratic lands ",

This is such a great point - and I see two perspectives - with infinite options in-between   Decentralized maxi role: put this up for vote and let voters decide.  Downside of this is that you can inadvertently lop side the Council.  I have seen this happen in a DAO and the result was some months later the non-represented workstreams were voted out of existence.   Inclusive maxi role: Each workstream has an equal representation on the council.  Downside of this is less governance-engaged workstreams takes up space that could be utilized by more engaged strategic thinkers - the larger the council, the greater the issue.   The middle path might be:  Encourage more steward participation from under represented workstreams Reserve limited percentage of seats for each workstream Encourage the right mindset: council members must think \u201cwhat is best for the DAO\u201d and not \u201cwhat is best for my workstream\u201d  The current version we are working includes a variation of #2, and specific wording around #3.  For number 1, I have reached out to an existing workstream that is underrepresented asked to join one of their calls (after GR15) to talk about the copious benefits of becoming a steward (fame, fortune, celebrity, etc. etc. etc.) does this approach resonate? Or are there other ideas we should consider? ",

If anyone needs it, here is a primer on metagovernance which I am a wee bit partial to. Although I believe there are fundamental gaps in the way web3 approaches metagovernance, I can see how it does not have (or has less of) the agency problem delegation has.  For clarity - I am referring to token-owned metagovernance, not just delegated metagovernance - which to me is just delegation to an org vs. an individual.

                    "content": " Preface In May of 2021 Gitcoin launched GTC, the native governance token for Gitcoin. Along with the creation of GTC, the governance of Gitcoin was handed over to the community via a group of individuals known as Stewards. Stewards are trusted community leaders with delegated (including self-delegated) voting power to make decisions on behalf of the community. To support a move towards more active and engaged governance participation, and recognizing governance took a significant amount of time, the Steward Council was created in March of 2022 and it consisted of the most active and engaged stewards as illustrated by the steward health cards found at https://www.daostewards.xyz/. Background on those efforts can be found here:  Introducing the Steward Council The Steward Council - Formation & Mandate Introducing v2 of the Steward Council & future plans   Proposal To continue a history of ongoing Governance evolution, this proposal seeks to build on what we have learned to date by implementing a number of course corrections. This proposal is split into the following sections:  Update objectives and role of the Steward Council Steward council remuneration Change the selection process for steward council members   1. Update objectives and role of the Steward Council The original objective of the steward council was to \u201cenable engagement through simple, non overly taxing yet highly valuable engagement flows using high context individuals\u201d. Specifically, the council was tasked with:  Keeping a \u2018docket\u2019 of ongoing proposals / their current status Ensuring proposals follow template(s) / adjustments to template Coming to an initial y/n answer on the proposal itself Bi-weekly sync calls for better alignment & broader DAO strategy discussion  During the Steward Council v1 retrospective, we received feedback that Gitcoin needed an externally connected strategic body and the original intent was for the Steward Council to become that body. As we adjust the focus on the Steward Council, we are looking to improve our market sensing ability and to develop deeper linkages to external protocols, DAOs and organizations who are solving similar issues. To make this happen, we propose the Steward Council pivot to an externally connected and strategically focused team. For reference, here is an illustration of of the current state and the future state: What changes: The work  image997\u00d7330 17.1 KB  What changes: The team To facilitate a move to an externally-aware advisory body, this proposal changes the team composition to 6 Gitcoin core team delegates and 10 external stewards. This move will bring external ideas into Gitcoin as well as help Gitcoin better sense market shifts. External stewards should be web3/DAO thought leaders and may include former or part-time Gitcoin contributors. Internal Gitcoin contributors will include 1 representative from each DAO workstream and one from the Gitcoin Foundation. The selection process of both stewards and Gitcoin representatives is explained in more detail in Part 3. Potential Outcomes for the Steward Council:  Provide input on organizational changes and proposals Recommended/provide input on significant partnership agreements/discussions Review and comment on strategy alignments related to Grants Protocol & Passport Protocol Improve proposals and updates to Gitcoin processes by providing input & suggestions Do deep dive reviews of seasonal budgets (aligning to one or two workstreams) Give expert input on CSDO/workstream issues & opportunities Identification of cross workstream overlaps  Concrete proposal for council (how might we achieve the outcomes above):  Steward council meets fortnightly, standing agenda topics to include:  Review/prereview of new proposals & provide input Review CSDO decisions/discussions & identify action items Review CSDO issues an participate in for async feedback & follow-up calls Workstream feedback sessions (on demand via workstream) Once a quarter CSDO representatives deep dive into budget proposals   Requirements for council members  Attend monthly Steward Sync calls (min. 2/3 per season) Attend fortnightly Steward Council calls (min. 4/6 per season) Attend & participate in ad-hoc meetings 2x30\u2019/min per month Arrive with pre-reading complete (when sent >24 hrs in advance) Give (substantial) feedback to min. 2 workstream budget proposals/quarter Provide input on relevant forum discussions Gitcoin delegates are expected to bring ad hoc topics for discussion    Meeting cadence & sample agenda: Steward Council members are expected to participate in the monthly Steward Sync meetings and Steward Council calls. Below are sample agendas to illustrate the differences between two meetings. Standing calls  image989\u00d7222 20.1 KB  Ad-hoc / on demand meetings: CSDO or Workstreams may request specific time with individual or small groups of Council members to work through relevant topics. Examples may include input on budgeting processes, compensation, strategic planning, or specific workstream topics like sybil strategies, marketing plans, or developer relations. Steward Council members are requested to join at least two 30 min sessions per month. Sample ad-hoc meetings and topics  FDD Sybil meeting: Review the most recent sybil attack for lessons learned MMM meeting: Request input on new Grants Protocol marketing campaign CSDO Budgeting: Discuss pros/cons for 3 vs. 6 month budget cycles DAOOps Community: Ideas to encourage community engagement Gitcoin Product Collective: Pre-test the release of the Round Manager module   2. Steward council remuneration: We expect the Steward Council will require time spent remaining externally connected while providing internal guidance and breadth. As such these roles will be rewarded with reputation (health cards), influence (GTC delegation) and compensation (GTC rewards). Reputation Being an elected & active Steward Council member will be one of the things that boost your score for the health cards considerably. The extra points for these will be added manually to the steward health card score on a monthly basis. Influence As many large GTC token holders allocate GTC delegation via Steward Health Cards scores, which are found at https://www.daostewards.xyz. The consistently higher a delegate score, the greater the possibility for GTC delegation. Compensation GTC compensation will vary depending on the current relationship to Gitcoin :  Existing full time Gitcoin contributors will receive a $200 stipend per month Existing part time Gitcoin contributors will receive a $400 stipend per month Non Gitcoin contributors will receive a $750 stipend per month  All payments will be in GTC, and will follow the existing monthly compensation process, to be initiated by the council member. This means the USD amounts will be the GTC amount at spot price, at the end of the preceding month. Alternatively, council members can choose to donate their proceeds to Gitcoin Grants. Additionally all Stewards (not only the Council) will also be compensated for any voting, which requires gas, these compensations will happen once every season and will count only for transactions linked to the eth address linked to the Steward\u2019s delegation address.  3. Updates to the selection process for steward council members The move to an externally connected strategic posture requires a special kind of person. Candidates must be able to understand Gitcoin\u2019s challenges & opportunities while being able to provide solutions and suggestions to those situations that fit with the strategic direction of Gitcoin. Characteristics of ideal candidates:  A passion for public goods or funding mechanisms to fund shared needs Recognized mastery in a specific DAO domain  ex: Product & business development, operations, marketing, governance   Demonstrated ability to think and influence strategically Experience in organizational or product development Exceptional communication skills  As such, we need to move past an algorithmic selection process (steward health cards) and use a more targeted approach to find the right candidates. Below is a proposal on the process Step 1: Workstream steward nomination: Each workstream and the Gitcoin Foundation will nominate one representative per season. These nominees (one from each workgroup) will represent the workstream on the council and will be tasked with bringing workstream issues & ideas to both the standing fortnightly calls and ad hoc meetings. The representative will also be tasked with bringing back relevant information to the workstreams from the Steward Council. Each workstream can use their own methodology for choosing a representative. The nominations from the workstreams are final and there is no confirmatory step. If a workstream representative cannot attend any call they must ensure they have a replacement to represent the workstream. Step 2: External steward nomination: In addition to nominating a representative, each workstream will nominate 3 stewards that will be entered into an electoral pool. Each nomination must be a Steward who is not active in our DAO or a non-full time workstream member or (i.e. an \u201cindependent\u201d member). Workstreams may nominate part-time Gitcoin contributors who are active externally or have relevant external experience & exposure. This allows Gitcoin to bring in external guidance and relevant domain expertise that might not be leveraged internally. The Steward Health Cards are used as a strong guiding metric, and workstreams are strongly encouraged to select Stewards with a +7 score. The Stewards need to confirm (before the election) that they will be able to meet the requirements of the Steward Council participation. The initial nominees will be reviewed by CSDO, who will identify nomination overlaps and reallocation nomination slots back to work streams if needed. Those who are interested in being nominated for the Steward Council should flag their interest on this post by including a link to their steward post which can be found here. For more information and questions on this process, please reach out to shawn16400#5507 on discord. An official call for nominees will follow once this proposal has been passed officially. Step 3: Steward elections: The fifteen nominees (5 workstreams x 3 candidates) will be entered into a quadratic voting pool for a steward vote using https://quadraticvote.co/ tool. Existing stewards will vote on nominees using the nominee linked bios found here. Each steward will receive 10 \u201cvotes\u201d, which can be used to vote for up to 10 candidates using the standard quadratic voting methodology. Individual voting links will be distributed via email to voters, and it is the responsibility of the voter to pass along their preferred email address. The top 10 of this ranking will be invited to join the Steward council, and the outcome of this Quadratic vote will be considered final. There will be no additional snapshot or Tally vote to ratify the selection of the 10 + 6 steward council members. Term length and limits Following the initial creation of The Steward Council - Formation & Mandate, the election term for external stewards will be from the time the proposal passes for a period of 180 days. Each successive term will be for the same duration and subsequent elections will be held prior to the close of each term to avoid gaps in coverage. Participation on the council is limited for external stewards to three successive terms. After a gap of one term, external stewards are eligible to begin a new-three term cycle. This constraint also applies to elected part-time Gitcoin contributors.  There are no term limits for internal workstream or Foundation representatives - however it is recommended the workstreams build capability for this work within their organizations. For questions, comments, or concerns on any of the above, please comment below. ",

I always appreciate your input given your breadth of experience.     epowell101:  I strongly agree that a more outward focus is important.

I wish there was some way to: a) make it much simpler and more clear to understand   Yeesh.   Yeah, first time I tried to understand it conceptually, I re-wrote it as a much simpler single-electoral format.  When I took a second look a the concept, I understood the mechanism was built to:  get adequate internal representation - elected by the DAO bring in external ideas - elected by the stewards  To do that we needed two separate selection processes to ensure we had the right level of representation.  Which makes it all a bit more complex.  How about this - i can do a quick 30min info session later this week to walk through the concept and in parallel, I will think about how to make it easier to understand.  Does that look like help?     epowell101:  b) less \u201cpolitical\u201d in the sense of requiring campaigning and so on   I know what you mean and it\u2019s one of the reasons I really appreciate the visibility provided by the Steward Health Cards and why we encourage using the tool when considering candidates:   The Steward Health Cards are used as a strong guiding metric, and workstreams are strongly encouraged to select Stewards with a +7 score.   Specifically to your point regarding campaigning, in an ideal situation we could build a \u201cmastery across DAOs\u201d metric into the steward health cards to get us closer to codifying the council selection process while still delivering a \u201cexternally connected strategic body\u201d.

This is a strong recommendation, but it is just a recommendation.  Workstreams have the autonomy to nominate anyone they choose.

Following the initial creation of The Steward Council - Formation & Mandate, the election terms will be from the time the proposal passes for a period of 180 days. Subsequent elections will be held prior to the close of each term to avoid a gap in council coverage. Adjusted text: Term length and limits Following the initial creation of The Steward Council - Formation & Mandate, the election term for external stewards will be from the time the proposal passes for a period of 180 days. Each successive term will be for the same duration and subsequent elections will be held prior to the close of each term to avoid gaps in coverage. Participation on the council is limited for external stewards to three successive terms. After a gap of one term, external stewards are eligible to begin a new-three term cycle. This constraint also applies to elected part-time Gitcoin contributors. There are no term limits for internal workstream or Foundation representatives - however it is recommended the workstreams build capability for this work within their organizations. ",

I do think we can probably streamline comms around how the council is managed at some point + agree with @lefterisjp that the cards in their current form likely need some revision. One other thing I think could be considered is revising compensation for external contributors. Folks already in the DAO have a lot of opportunities / reasons to be on the council. Folks who are external likely have more on their plates and often (in the case of Gitcoin) find it very difficult to make time to participate with everything else going on. With that in mind I\u2019d recommend we increase the minimum threshold compensation there as a show of good faith. ",

One difficulty was trying to estimate the amount of time required to make a consequential impact, especially as we are introducing the workstream ad hoc collaboration meetings.  How about this, given we (presumably) will have a framework for compensation, I can take a follow up survey at the end of 60 days to see if an adjustment is needed.  Sound about right? ",

These actions steps were identified from voter survey and a review of those results. We welcome any additional feedback you might have, but at this point we consider the election process closed for this round. Thanks to everyone who helped build this process and those who participated in the election process. Here is the list of items we will work in order to improve our voting processes  Voting mechanisms:  Continue pushing for QV+Snapshot proposal (link) Investigate how QV dilutes the steward impact Continue voting experiments Get community input on: token weighted voting vs. egalitarian vote Work with snapshot to improve show how vote choices map to votes cast   Communications:  Spend more time on external communications Write a blogpost about becoming a steward and include a \u201chow to\u201d Do better at commercializing the value of becoming a steward Continue building out the steward engagement strategy   Nominations:  Get community input: Is there another path (other than workstreams) for nominees? We should host / offer up candidate AMAs Decide on a position: should candidates abstain from voting?    Assets developed and can be reapplied Steward Council Election process : (link) Post election survey guide (link) Post mortem document (link) Setting up quadratic voting in Snapshot (draft) the full post mortem slide deck can be found here  (link) ",
