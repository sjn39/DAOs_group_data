A few weeks ago relatively DAI reached almost $1B of DAI in that network, perhaps low due to current market conditions. I understand that AVAX is in the DAI strategies in various L2 or Sidechains, it would be interesting to apply the strategy that I mentioned in various discussions or posts in the forum of various sidechains using your collateral token and use that DAI for the development of the same, a la Matic, and possibly a la GNOSIS.

MakerDAO: Long-term Growth Strategy for the Future of DeFi   4. Drive Native Retail Adoption in a Multi-Chain Universe As DAI (should be our North Star ), we need to find retail users again. To give DAI stable end-user demand, Maker needs to go to where the users are, and the users are drifting to Layer 2s and multi-chain. A robust infrastructure is necessary to reach all of these players and Maker is on the way to positioning itself at the center of an ecosystem with Maker MCD, DAI and Maker Teleport at the core.    I think this is crucial, the experience in Avalanche (and I assume it must be replicated in other networks) indicates that when users are offered a native stablecoins, their use grows in detriment of bridged strablecoins.

That\u2019s been the case since March.   twitter.com    Emin G\u00fcn Sirer\ud83d\udd3a @el33th4xor  It's a good idea to replace bridged assets (e.g. USDT.e and USDC.e) with native ones (e.g. USDT and USDC) on #Avalanche. twitter.com/bit_gossip/sta\u2026   Squanch\ud83d\udd3a @bit_gossip  .\u2066\u2066@FTX_Official\u2069 just enabled USDC (wen USDT?) deposit and withdrawals for Avalanche C chain.

I\u2019m asking cuz I know in Maker we are thinking first on L2s so we can relay on the Ethereum safety. But for example Avalanche, Polygon and even the BNB Smart Chain are the networks that most of the retail users adopt cuz of marketing and other features. Isn\u2019t important for us to have a strong presence there? And if so, a wrapped presence is enough? Thanks! ",

Unless Maker decides to have vaults on chains other than Ethereum, like like Qi DAO or even Abracadabra. I\u2019ve always thought having vaults on L2s and L1s like Avalanche would be a great move for Maker. In fact for a long time I had assumed Maker\u2019s multi chain strategy would involve implementing vaults on different chains. To me just implementing a cannonical bridge as Maker\u2019s whole multi-chain strategy is a wasted opportunity. Having vaults on different chains + the bridge would be a huge step forward imo, since it would allow to widen the spectrum of collaterals (ie AVAX and other assets on Avalanche), as well as having the possibility to connect Maker with other DeFi ecosystems and move DAI more securely from one chain to another.
