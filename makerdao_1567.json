                    "content": " Problem: Currently, there is no incentive for small MKR holders to actively participate in governance voting.  There are no rewards to encourage MKR holders to either actively vote or delegate so their tokens become active in voting.  In reality, if a smallholder is to participate it costs them money via gas fees to vote.  Campaign Solution: The events team has decided to create a voting incentive campaign by means of using tickets to DAIvinity events as a reward mechanism.  Demand for DAIvinity tickets has been extremely high for the last few events and this trend is expected to continue.  By leveraging this demand, we believe we can attract small MKR holders to engage in governance voting by offering a ticket to a DAIvinity event as a reward for this participation.  How are tickets currently allocated? Over the past few events, tickets have been distributed about 25% via public twitter release, 60% via CU members and 15% by direct requests.  CU members generally distribute to business partners, VCs, media or other ETH protocols.  The direct request are generally protocols, VCs & Delegates. The portion of tickets we release via Twitter is what we will use to give priority access to active voting MKR holders.  The Twitter-distributed tickets are quite hard to get and often get consumed in a matter of minutes during public releases.  Desired Outcomes: The goal of this campaign is to address the problem of voting incentives and attract existing and new MKR holders to vote; Here is a general list of outcomes;  Increase of <50 MKR holder participation Promotion for people to procure MKR and start participation in governance voting Increase social media chatter regarding MKR voting Draw social media attention to Maker in general Have greater representation of MKR holders at DAIvinity events.   Parameters: The campaign\u2019s goal is to target small MKR holders and encourage them to vote in governance.  Larger MKR holders are generally known and are already able to access tickets via contacting our team.  We have set the following eligibility parameters so that the proper group is targeted.  Maximum MKR per vote participation:  50 MKR We have selected this threshold as this is what we are considering a small MRK holder for the sake of this campaign.  Minimum # of unique voting polls:   TBD This number has been derived by backtesting to ensure there is a good balance of poll participation and ticket availability.  Maximum Tickets Allocated: 100 Tickets 100 of our tickets will be allocated to anyone who qualifies to receive a ticket.  In the case of more qualifying voters than tickets then a ranked list will be created with the following ranking criteria: 1st: Number of polls voted 2nd: Time final vote cast from the start of the poll.  Ineligible Addresses; Recognized Delegates (& Delegators):  Delegates can already get tickets and are expected to hold high governance participation.  Delegators of recognized delegates are also ineligible as the campains goal is active voter participation, people who delegate are passive. Address with >50 MKR voting:  Per above does not qualify a small MKR holder for this campaign. Shadow Delegates:  Delegator addresses of shadow delegates are also disqualified  Implementation: This voter incentive campaign will run from Aug 17 to Oct 1.  On Oct 2 the voter data will be analyzed and ranked per the above parameters. Tickets will be distributed by contacting eligible ETH addresses on Oct 2 via etherscan messaging.  Tickets must be claimed by Oct 7th or they will be forfeited.  Campaign Pro & Cons  Pros  Direct incentives for small MKR holders to vote Encourage new voters and holders (People may buy MKR to participate) Growth of governance voter participation Ideally see a growth of active users on the MKR forum   Cons;  Voters could be voting just for rewards without considering actually what the vote is about This could cause some un-delegation as people whom delegate don\u2019t qualify   Some notes about the cons: While the campaign does present the issue of voters not actually reading or caring about their vote this downside would be a no different result with any other type of incentive.  The MKR that could be voting blind is not expected to change the overall direction of the vote as eligibility above limits the voting MKR.   We expect a range of MKR influx to be not more than 1000 MKR based on our best guess. The un-delegation issue is also limited to anyone holding 50 MKR due to eligibility.  Not enough to change any delegated compensation or weight to an impactful extent.  Campaign Schedule Aug 10-17: Forum RFC period,  any feedback or suggestions welcome Aug 17:  Contest Announcement via Twitter Aug 17-Oct 1: Voter data collection Oct 2: Tickets sent through etherscan to qualifying addresses ",

I am glad to see this push to incentive lower-stakes voters, driving participation and a feeling of ownership among these small token-holders. At a glance, it seems like users are paying for the tickets. An easy assumption could be: tickets = votes cast * average gas cost per vote. Don\u2019t have the numbers now but feels like it would float around ~$200? Is this a fair value for the tickets? It seems to ignore the cost of travel, lodging, etc which is required to attend most DAIvinity events - what do you do if you earn the tickets but can\u2019t travel?

An easy assumption could be: tickets = votes cast * average gas cost per vote. Don\u2019t have the numbers now but feels like it would float around ~$200?   This comment isn\u2019t clear to me.  I guess you can assume the cost to someone is the gas fee to vote but I don\u2019t think will cost $200 of gas to vote.  From what I can tell it cost a smallholder ~$0.2 to $0.5 worth of eth to vote currently.  I\u2019m not the best at interpreting on-chain data\u2026  We still need to set the minimum vote # participation for this but my guess it will be around 4 or 5 votes to qualify.  So a couple of dollars of gas to qualify.     fig:  It seems to ignore the cost of travel, lodging, etc which is required to attend most DAIvinity events - what do you do if you earn the tickets but can\u2019t travel?   Correct it does not take into account the travel.  So yes this can be viewed as limiting just to people who are already planning on attending the conference.

Passive participation for small holders makes a lot more sense than active participation though, due to the gas costs of voting. We should encourage passive participation through delegation as much as we can. Most active participation that this campaign would cause would likely be short-lived due to the gas and time costs of actively voting. Just doesn\u2019t make sense for smaller holders.
