Paragraph Summary The original budget for SAS-001 is expiring 30-Nov-2022. This subproposal creates a new budget stream for the Core Unit to continue operations through 30-Nov-2023. Changes & modifications from the original MIP40c3-SP43 budget subproposal:  SAS-001 Annual Budget Cap reduced from 1,130,392.56 DAI to 1,040,100.00 DAI (New Base) or 946,950.00 DAI (New Bear).  2023 Budget Breakdown. Updated Transaction. Updated Smart Contract Implementation.   Addition of new sections to meet the MIP4c2-SP19 amendment:  Roadmap and Objective. Summarising Value to MKR Holders. Contingency Planning - Scenarios . Return Excess Funds. Unwinding and Defunding. Proposal Parameters.   Minor grammatical and formatting updates to the Budget Implementation.   Specification  Motivation Based on the nature of the work done by the Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit (SAS), the budget reflects the needs of the team to ensure continuity of the work described in our MIP39. This is summarized in, but not limited to:  Provide intuitive UIs and well-maintained APIs for interaction with the auction mechanism (to increase accessibility and adoption). Help ensure that there is always sufficient auction participation, even in extreme circumstances such as:  Protocol upgrades (e.g., new collateral types). Inefficient market conditions.     Core Unit ID SAS-001  Budget Implementation  Modifications from the Original MIP40: MIP40c3-SP43  Included budget transparency graphic & link. Minor grammatical and formatting updates.    1239\u00d7680 63.5 KB  SES Auditor Framework Details The budget implementation will follow standard best practices as recommended by the SES Core Unit. The setup of this framework uses an Auditor wallet and an Operational Wallet, which will be topped up on a monthly basis with a 3-month runway. The budget cap will be streamed from the protocol to the Auditor Wallet to reduce the overhead for Maker governance.  Multisig Wallets The following multisigs are involved:   The Auditor Wallet \u2013 A nested, 2-out-of-2 Auditor multi-sig, composed of 1-out-of-2 role based multi-sigs as signers. The Auditor Wallet will have two roles defined for its signers: Auditors and Accountants. The Accountant Role Multi-sig will have two signers\u2014both SES permanent team contributors. The Auditor Role Multisig will also have two signers, also both SES permanent team contributors. SES will conduct the monthly auditing process as described in the Monthly Top-up Cycle below, increasing transparency of the auditing process for the community. The Maker Protocol (MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB) will be listed as a beneficiary on the Auditor Wallet. This allows the protocol to withdraw up to 1B DAI from the Auditor Multisig wallet, ensuring control over these funds and acting as a backup. This multisig will hold funds up to the Quarterly Budget Cap in DAI and receive the DssVest stream. All funds pass through this wallet before any are sent to the Operational Wallet.   The Operational Wallet \u2013 This is a 2-out-of-3 multisig controlled by SAS-001.    Monthly Budget Statement Within the first five days of each month, SAS-001 will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditor Wallet with the following sections:   Previous Month Actuals \u2013 The actual expenses (DAI and MKR) of the month that just ended.  Budget Forecast - A forecast of the Dai amount required to maintain a 3-month operational runway for the team based on the latest available information.  MKR Vesting Overview - A schedule of the expected MKR vesting amounts for the current team configuration, grouped by the pay-out month.  Transactions  The required DAI amount from the Auditor Wallet sent to the Operational Wallet to replenish the 3-month runway as indicated in the Budget Forecast section. Any excess DAI amount above the 3-month forecast in the Operational Wallet that will be returned to the Auditor Wallet.    The Monthly Budget Statements can be found in this GitHub repository.  Monthly Top-up Cycle   Monthly Budget Statement Submission \u2013 Within the first five days of the month, SAS-001 submits the Monthly Budget Statement to the Auditor Wallet signers. This report is also available for the rest of the community to review.  Transaction Requests Submission \u2013 In parallel, SAS-001 submits the necessary transaction requests for the Auditor Wallet signers to sign:  DAI Top-up Transaction \u2013 One DAI transaction for the Operational Wallet that adds enough funds to the Operational Wallet to replenish the forecast 3-month runway. Only applies if the Operational Wallet balance is below this forecast.    Returning Excess Funds \u2013 SAS-001 creates and signs any transactions for excess funds that should be returned to the Auditor Wallet:  Excess DAI Transactions \u2013 DAI transactions for Operational Wallets that have a balance above the 3-Month Budget Forecast will be returned to the Auditor Wallet.    DssVest Pull - The Auditor Wallet signers will pull available funds from the SAS-001 DssVest contract, replenishing the available funds in the Auditor Wallet.  Auditors\u2019 Review \u2013 The Auditor Wallet signers review the Monthly Budget Statement. First, Accountant Role signers will review the initial report submitted by SAS-001 to ensure data accuracy and report completeness. A consistent audit checklist will be followed. The Auditor Role will then receive the Accountant\u2019s report generated from the checklist, and verify the Accountant\u2019s findings.  A summary of each audit cycle\u2019s report will be made available to the Maker Community at the conclusion of the audit cycle on the SAS-001\u2019s transparency reporting repository on GitHub.    Transaction Approvals \u2013 Upon acceptance of the Monthly Budget Statement audit, an Accountant Role signer and an Auditor Role signer will sign the requested transactions, sending the DAI top-up amounts to the Operational Wallet.  Auditor Wallet Returns \u2013 The Auditor Wallet signers will return any amount of DAI above 2x the Monthly Budget Cap. The Auditor Wallet, using the DssBlow contract described here, will return the excess DAI directly to the surplus buffer.  The Auditor Wallet will then hold up to 2x the Monthly Budget Cap at the start of the month, allowing DssVest to stream DAI up to the Quarterly Budget Cap over the course of the month.

New Base Initial Seed Transfer 433,375 DAI will be transferred to 0xb1f950a51516a697E103aaa69E152d839182f6Fe address on Date 2022-12-02.   New Bear Initial Seed Transfer 394,562.50 DAI will be transferred to 0xb1f950a51516a697E103aaa69E152d839182f6Fe address on Date 2022-12-02.   This seeds the Operational Wallet to 3x the Month Budget Cap. This also initially funds the Auditor Wallet to 2x the Monthly Budget Cap. The top-up transfer funds the Operational Wallet. This also then positions DssVest to begin streaming funds up to the Quarterly Budget Cap each month in the Auditor Wallet.  Smart Contract Implementation This budget implementation uses the DssVest. One of the two following budget streams is approved based on the rank-choice voting outcome of this subproposal\u2019s Ratification Poll.   New Base Budget Stream A total of 1,040,100 DAI will be streamed to 0xb1f950a51516a697E103aaa69E152d839182f6Fe starting 2022-12-01 and ending 2023-11-30.   New Bear Budget Stream A total of 946,950 DAI will be streamed to 0xb1f950a51516a697E103aaa69E152d839182f6Fe starting 2022-12-01 and ending 2023-11-30.    Budget Breakdown This budget proposal is optimized for reducing our existing budget based on actual needs, without impairing execution of our mandate.  Budget Details This section describes the Expense Categories that comprise the budget and how their monthly amount was determined. We have slightly updated the budget categories compared to last year\u2019s budget MIP to stay in accordance with MIP40 budget category updates. Compensation and Benefits: This category covers the monthly salaries of the 3.5 FTE in the team on a contractor basis. We\u2019ve stayed in the same team for the past 16 months and intend to continue our work in a similar manner. Even though the knowledge and market value of the team members might have increased since last year, we agreed in the team to not increase the individual salaries due to bear market conditions. For this category, we offer the MKR holders two options: Staying in the same team (New Bear option) or extending the team (New Base option) by 0.5 FTE to strengthen the smart contract development capabilities of the Core Unit. Travel and Entertainment: Stays the same as last year to be able to finance a few offsites and conferences. Software Development Expense: Stays the same as last year (formerly called Engineering contractors). We\u2019ve made good experience with outsourcing simpler development tasks to trusted contractors so that our Senior Core Team can focus on harder topics. Software Expense: Stays the same as last year and includes SaaS and Infrastructure costs. Gas Expense: 50% decrease to last year based on past experience. Admin Expense: New category, pooling together Office Space and Other Contractor Services from last year. We were able to reduce these expenses by 76% mainly due to removing payment processor fees a few months ago. Professional Services: Stays the same as last year, mainly accounting work and legal consultations. Contingency Buffer: Similar to other Core Units, we significantly reduce the buffer. After operating for a year with the current budget, we have a better understanding of which costs and risks can occur. Any changes to these amounts will be reported in the transparency report and reviewed by our budget auditors.

Increasing Value to Maker Token holders Liquidations and auctions are important security mechanisms to keep the Maker Protocol free of debt. A healthy auction ecosystem helps to operate the protocol sustainably and therefore increases trust. Besides, a healthy auction ecosystem helps with better outcomes for vault owners in cases of liquidations, which can increase user satisfaction. These factors are the motivation for keeping a dedicated Auction Services Team. In the past 16 months we\u2019ve shown that we constantly and independently execute on our roadmap and keep shipping in bi-weekly sprints. Some of the delivered value includes:  An added layer of security via a highly accessible Unified Auctions UI that increases auction participation and is always up-to-date with the latest state of the protocol (e.g., support of new collaterals; in the future auction settlement on L2). A fallback solution via a keeper implementation that prevents auctions in which there is no participation and functions as a means to test contracts during the collateral onboarding process. Decentralization of protocol interaction by providing the products (i.e., UI, keeper) in a way so that everyone can spin them up and run on their own.  While we\u2019ve executed on most initial roadmap items, our mandate requires continued work and further work items to maximize the value for Maker Token holders. See the Roadmap section below. Lastly, we want to point out that we see ourselves as a small, efficient and loyal software development team. We stayed in the same team composition for the past 16 months and gained a lot of specific, technical knowledge about the protocol. While our mandate might evolve, we believe that the engineering value we can deliver to the Maker protocol will keep compounding over time.  Roadmap and Objectives We\u2019ve fulfilled the vast majority of initial roadmap items and discovered new ones along the way.  We are still collecting and prioritizing longer term roadmap items also based on the overall direction of the DAO. Here\u2019s a glimpse of what is on the roadmap right now.  1. Maintain and Extend Existing Products Based on Protocol Development  Operating, maintaining and improving the existing product suite (UI, Keeper, Twitter Bot). Collateral onboarding (latest rETH). Simulations to test liquidation-relevant smart contracts like the exchange callees even before the onboarding spell is deployed to mainnet. But also allow simulating mass liquidation events to ensure the robustness of the overall auction infrastructure. At some point next year, the developed products will be extended to support auctions and liquidations on L2s. We believe the importance of accessible auctions will grow in a more fragmented, multichain world.   2. Improve Collateral Auction Outcomes As a reminder, the better the price of an auction, the better for vault owners. There are at least two known features that should further improve the outcomes:  Enable the pooling of liquidity from multiple sources for flash loan execution of auctions via a dedicated 1inch based exchange callee contract. This contract will be developed by us to save bandwidth of Protocol Engineering (PE-001). Alongside we want to introduce support for multiple callee contracts to always have a fallback solution for execution in place (e.g., if 1inch service fails, Uniswap V3 callee can still be used). Partial execution of large auctions via flash loans. We\u2019ve seen in the past that large auctions are harder to settle, so this feature will help with improving outcomes and democratize partial participation in larger auctions.   3. Censorship-resistant Vault Management UI  In the past months, we\u2019ve extended the Unified Auctions UI with the feature to liquidate underwater vaults. Therefore, the products cover already an earlier step in the \u201clifecycle of an auction\u201d. The next step in this vertical integration is vault management. In light of the current regulatory pressure, we believe it is valuable to access all core Maker functionalities through permissionless/decentralized interfaces. As a reminder, everyone with basic programming knowledge can spin up an instance of the Unified Auctions UI. So it seems obvious to include vault management into this resilient UI. From a technical perspective, there are a lot of synergies, too. On top of that, we are exploring IPFS hosting.   Contingency Planning - Scenarios In case of unforeseen events that might lead to funding issues, we could decide to execute on the following temporary measures:  Scale down our SaaS subscriptions. Halt majority of contracting work. Reduce spendings on office and events.   Unwinding and Defunding Within one month of the ratification of the offboarding proposal, the Facilitator will submit a proposal to the community documenting the plan for the wind-down of SAS-001. This plan will include line items of the necessary tasks to complete unwinding, a projected timeline, as well as a cost estimate for completion of the wind-down proposal. After the completion of the shutdown, any remaining budget will be returned to the DAO with the following exceptions:  Any outstanding payments that are owed to external parties and contributors but have not yet been paid. If SAS-001 and/or its management are involved in active litigation and need to retain a subset of the budget to resolve legal disputes.  SAS-001 contributor MKR vesting will be accelerated to the nearest 6-month vest on completion of the wind-down. This means a contributor vesting 10 MKR annually would vest 5 MKR at completion of the wind-down. The above clause overrides the 12-month cliff.  Return of Excess Funds As defined in the Budget Implementation section above, SAS-001 follows the SES Auditor Framework. Excess funds above the 3-month forecast will be returned on a monthly basis, meeting the requirements of MIP4c2-SP14.

Having started my review, I have a few initial questions.     danik:  Contingency Buffer: Similar to other Core Units, we significantly reduce the buffer. After operating for a year with the current budget, we have a better understanding of which costs and risks can occur.   Could you elaborate on what happened to the previous contingency buffer? Did it get spent or are you still in possession of it?     danik:  An added layer of security via a highly accessible Unified Auctions UI that increases auction participation and is always up-to-date with the latest state of the protocol (e.g. support of new collaterals; in the future auction settlement on L2)   Can you provide any data on the increase of auction participation? Furthermore, can you give any breakdown of what portion of auctions had the winning bid come from the UI as opposed to being from a bot?     danik:  Decentralization of protocol interaction by providing the products (i.e. UI, keeper) in a way so that everyone can spin them up and run on their own   Can you provide an overview of the number of new versus old actors following the implementation of these changes?     danik:  Return of Excess Funds As defined in the Budget Implementation section above, SAS-001 follows the SES Auditor Framework. Excess funds above the 3 month forecast will be returned on a monthly basis, meeting the requirements of MIP4c2-SP14.   As far as I am able to tell this core unit has not returned any funds since inception. Could you provide a little more colour why this has not occured? Moving on While reviewing the past have some benefits the real value lies in the future so going forward there are some other things I hope could be expanded on: Can you expand on risk considerations with introducing flash loans into the auction process? The last question for now. Considering the proposed changes to MakerDAO, have you given any thought about starting or joining a Creator Cluster like Crimson? ",

Let me structure my reply by categories:  Budget     JustinCase:  Could you elaborate on what happened to the previous contingency buffer? Did it get spent or are you still in possession of it?       JustinCase:  As far as I am able to tell this core unit has not returned any funds since inception. Could you provide a little more colour why this has not occured?   We did not spend any of the contingency buffer budget. At the beginning of every month, our operational wallet receives a top-up from the SES-controlled auditor wallet. The top-up is based on the funds that were spent in the previous month. Therefore, there has never been excess budget in the operational wallet. The auditor assured me that there is also no excess budget in the auditor wallet right now, just the usual 2 months runway.  Product  Users     JustinCase:  Can you provide any data on the increase of auction participation? Furthermore, can you give any breakdown of what portion of auctions had the winning bid come from the UI as opposed to being from a bot?       JustinCase:  Can you provide an overview of the number of new versus old actors following the implementation of these changes?   During the last big stress test in May, we collected some data, which you can find here. The general pattern we observe is that ETH auctions settle via competitive bots and more exotic collateral types settle via SAS tools. The likely reason is that the required integration overhead for these profit-oriented bots is not worth it. Based on this pattern, we assume that future non-L1 auctions are also likely to settle primarily through SAS tools. Nevertheless, our main focus is to be an always working backstop solution no matter which collateral type or amount is auctioned. During the few stress tests that we encountered so far, we achieved this goal. Still, giving more liquidity options and partial bidding are the next features to become an even more robust backstop solution to be prepared for all kinds of black swan events.  Flash Loans     JustinCase:  Can you expand on risk considerations with introducing flash loans into the auction process?   Let me clarify the background first: On a protocol level, Flash Lending capability exists since the introduction of Liquidation 2.0 module as you can read here. You can also refer to this as an atomic swap. At the end of last year, SAS used the existing module to enable capital-free participation in auctions via UI and Keeper. There is no new risk with making Flash Lending more accessible, as all tools still support the alternative, Participation with Dai, flow. The risk with the current Flash Lending functionality is that it depends on Uniswap V3 pools for liquidity. Bidders do not always receive the best possible price, some auctions take longer to settle than they should and for large auctions there might be not enough liquidity in the pool. Therefore, it makes sense to extend the liquidity options by adding an additional option e.g. to 1inch. This was a long term wish from PE, but they lack time to implement this. Therefore, SAS took this over and is building it end-to-end (including smart-contract work).  Organization     JustinCase:  The last question for now. Considering the proposed changes to MakerDAO, have you given any thought about starting or joining a Creator Cluster like Crimson ?   Yes, we are thinking about it. Let me share my current stance, even though it can evolve depending on the overall DAO-wide developments of the next months: Our current responsibility is to provide security to the core protocol through accessible and always up-to-date tools. This work supports decentralization and ensures there is always a working backstop solution. Therefore, the top priority is to ensure business continuity on the backstop-solution-related work, which should stay part of the core protocol. Additionally, we are exploring how in the future, some less security-sensitive work can become a profit center by itself. Some domains that were discussed with other CUs so far include:  Develop a competitive keeper to participate in auctions ourselves Expand into a resiliency-focused Vault Management UI that generates fees Providing development services to other MetaDAOs (onboard new collateral into auction-related tools, more general but still Maker-specific UI, API and Smart Contract development)  ",
