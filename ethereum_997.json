I also want to allow developers to become the \u201cdefault delegate\u201d for their specific democracies, in order to allow early development to happen without bothering token holders, but meanwhile keeping the veto capabilities of token holders, therefore keeping an equilibrium in trust required.

Topics cannot be merged, splited, and duplicates are meaningless, or this dont apply here.

If thats not needed after a time, its up to the DAO rules to specify the life cycle. The goal of this EIP is not to define how DAOs or voting works, but how they can use a common trust network, and how this trust network relates to sub topics (the specific topics for a DAO). It relates to voting, but does not define it, only specifies how Influence can flow between accounts using this Trust Network defined in the EIP itself. For example, a sub topic could even be an upgradable contract, and the subtopic can be controlled by a democracy, which then could vote to change the behavior of voting. The democracy itself can be upgradable.  The democracy would need a subtopic if it spawns a subdemocracy (for controlling a subproject), but all is defined up to the democracy rules. I am writing a democracy contract, which uses this trust network, but I dont think worth specifing it, as its not a \u201cinteroperability\u201d issue, I mean, the democracy and its delegation topics are part of the same project, which will have its own documentation. There are other parts, like Voting, which can be EIPed, but would be a different EIP, and there is also EIP about it which we can use instead. ",

This is up to the Democracy implentation. There are many ways of solving that. One way would be using something like a block explorer, or something like a message notification.     Ethernian:  How to keep the user attention spent on \u201cright\u201d things and prevent spamming?   This is also again about how the implementation is defined. I dont think a DAO would allow anyone to create a topic and start voting on it, probably to create a new subtopic it would need to be approved by the democracy as a proposal, then it would be included. But of course, is impossible to prevent someone from making a subtopic outside of the democracy, however it wont be recognized by the main democracy, it could be a sub democracy that is not connected to the main democracy, and is a different app. To prevent spam, is also a rule of the proposal manager, for example, it could request a stake payment of the voting token to send a proposal, which is refunded after approval, or burned if rejected. The stake payment could be optional, and the higher value, the more visibility it have for the community.     Ethernian:  Delegating of voting power is more a technical question and looks secondary to me.   The goal of the EIP is provide a common trust network, this means that you can trust the same address for every DAO. Thinking better about multiple inheritance, it can be useful for having delegation on topic types, not only on specific topics, and Ill think better on how to implement that. ",

Sorry for that. let me provide here one quotation from  PGP User\u2019s Guide, Volume I: Essential Topics by Philip Zimmermann (yes I am old\u2026 too old  )  Trust is not necessarily transferable; I have a friend who I trust not to lie. He\u2019s a gullible person who trusts the President not to lie. That doesn\u2019t mean I trust the President not to lie. This is just common sense. If I trust Alice\u2019s signature on a key, and Alice trusts Charlie\u2019s signature on a key, that does not imply that I have to trust Charlie\u2019s signature on a key.  Liquid Democracy, as I know it, is assuming the trust is objective and transferable for much more complex topics than just signature management. Here I have my doubts.

Also, you don\u2019t have to watch it, just listen, like a podcast, but the presentation is like 25 minutes, the remaining is Q/A, which is also interesting. What are your doubts? That someone cannot trust other in a very specific topic? If you address the problem clearly I can explain how you can solve it under Liquid Democracy. I am aware of the weaknesses of Delegation, and under my version of Liquid Democracy (called \u00b5Topic Democracy) I am implementing counter measures to assert that Delegation is reversible even after approval. I didnt wanted to enter in details here because I think is out of scope, but I am happy to discuss it if you willing, as it might be important for the design of this EIP. First of all, we need to address Why liquid democracy? There are many constraints that cause low vote engagement, such as low understanding of issues, not enough time to take care of decisions, cost associated with voting. The strongest point is voting complexity, not everyone is aware about everything at everytime. The liquid democracy would solve that by using the influence flow of specializable delegation chains, that builds a trust network. Delegates with many voting power can more easily reach absolute quorums (50%+1) or even qualified quorums (90%) then many individuals by their own. What are the weakness of delegation? The weakness that delegation brings is the reintroduction of trust, as you mentioned, trusting is something we don\u2019t like here in blockchain world. Centralization of power is another problem that is brought by delegation, we can have too few individuals with all power. Maybe you can contribute to this list aswell? What are your doubts? How my version of Liquid Democracy Works? \u00b5Topic Democracy aims to solve the weakness of trust by requiring a veto period before execution. The Veto Period uses a different delegation topic (veto delegation) and require a very low quorum to a proposal be vetoed. A veto can only be suggested for something that was previously approved, and takes the same duration of the voting period. However, before approval, during the voting period, anyone that delegated can overwrite the vote and undelegate, because it uses the voting end block to read delegation and token balances. The centralization of power is aimed to be solved by allowing the micro topics to be very specific, so instead of centralizing the influence, it is redistributed through the delegation chains. There is need of information tooling to visualize how your influence is being used by the delegates. \u00b5Topic Democracy incentives direct voting by externalizing the gas cost to the proponent, signed votes can be included in a merkle tree, which can be counted in a tabulation period, paid by the proponent (or volunteers). Is possible to also operate on a total offchain tabulation, where you specify an proof-of-stake system (or authority with large stake to determine the voting result), which is calculated offchain, and included by this address, and can be contested by anyone simply by paying the gas cost of tabulation, similar to plasma contract security.

My problem: The trust about a very specific topic can\u2019t be delegated or combined with trust of another topic. The trust about general topic can be delegated, but leads to wrong conclusions, I believe. It becomes more clear if you take precise examples instead of abstractions. Example:  Alice trusts Bob to manage HER funds. Bob claims to have delegated trust for the topic \u201cmanaging Alice\u2019s funds\u201d. Peter trusts Queen to manage HIS funds. Queen claims to have delegated trust for the topic \u201cmanaging Peters\u2019s funds\u201d. Cecile starts voting weighted by trust with Bob and Queen taking part.  How Cecil should compare trust \u201cnumbers\u201d? Ignoring the fact topics are different? Normalizing topics to make them comparable like \u201cmanaging someone\u2019s funds\u201d? unclear. ",

I dont think this is useful for delegating trust for managing funds of an individual, but from a public reserve yes, not that is impossible, but its impractical, this is not created to become a trust entitlement over private funds, this is created to gather opinion (as carbon vote) and for governance of DApps.  How Cecil should compare trust \u201cnumbers\u201d? Ignoring the fact topics are different?  This can be easily done by a UI, its a matter of selecting the topic and visualizing your influence and your delegation, or visualizing from anyone (its transparent delegation), its a matter of rendering useful data (information) to user. From a code perspective, the topics have no relation, or if have, they might have a common ancestor, I don\u2019t see any issue with that, this is the intended design. ",
