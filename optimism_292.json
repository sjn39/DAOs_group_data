This proposal may fall under the remit of various DeFi committees. Project description : Sonne Finance is an EVM compatible lending/borrowing protocol that launched on Optimism. Sonne Finance provides peer-to-peer lending solutions that are fully decentralized, transparent and non-custodial. Similar to (and based from) existing lending platforms, users will be able to lend any supported assets on our platform, and use their capital to borrow supported assets. Sonne aims to be the prime lending platform on Optimism by offering highest competitive incentives for money markets, having the deepest liquidity and being native to Optimism. Sonne innovates on revenue sharing and tokenomics, where stakers of the protocol gets 2 different type of revenues (VELO and SONNE or USDC), as well as being able to choose the reward asset between SONNE and USDC.

Our lead developer (gathon) was also the lead developer of one of the biggest NFT marketplaces in Binance smart chain. Amaterasu is working with me for 2 years, and she is working on lending protocols in particular for 10 months now. Our community managers are from AdminGuru team, which provides professional community management services for protocols. We are also friends in real life. Our designers are awarded designers for UI/UX in Turkey. We worked with them for 4 years now (not just for Sonne Finance) and also life-long friends. Currently, I (atakan-IntroToDeFi) am the only one who is doxxed in our team to public, but all the team members are doxxed to me. Relevant usage metrics :  Total Supply: $43M (Achieved in 11 days.) Total Borrow: $30M TVL : $13M Total staked: 3.8M $SONNE (Sonne Finance \u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\udd34)  Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): https://aave.com/ Is this project be open sourced? Yes Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 28 Sep 2022 Ecosystem Value Proposition: Lending/borrowing protocols are the basis of DeFi, and currently there is no native lending protocol besides Sonne Finance. Being native to Optimism gives us the power of using our tokens to incentivize lending and borrowing heavily. In the past, TVL migrations happened from chain to chain when there are single sided good yields without impermanent loss. It is unlikely that people migrating for 3% yield on USDC, but we already proved that good incentives can change this sentiment. We are planning to be the reason why people migrate and use Optimism, as once they try, they will stick to the fast and cheap transactions. To add to this, competition is always healthy for customers. Right now, AAVE is non-contested liquidity market. Sonne looks to be the prime liquidity market on Optimism with unique tokenomics, and force other competitors to innovate on Optimism. For example, AAVE has no drive to innovate on Optimism, but when there is competition, they will have to innovate or fall back. We have no plans to go multichain. Sonne has one aim. Being the best liquidity market of Optimism and focus only on Optimism ecosystem. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No. Number of OP tokens requested: 250,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No How much will your project match in co-incentives? We are already incentivizing users to use Optimism and Sonne with 60% of our tokens, which equals to 1000% of requested OP tokens at current prices. Proposal for token distribution: How will the OP tokens be distributed?  95% will be allocated to lending/borrowing and staking rewards in order to boost activity. Here\u2019s how 95% will be allocated respectfully:  40% will be allocated to supplying incentives. The pool weights of distribution speeds will be the same with $SONNE reward distribution speeds. 40% will be allocated to borrowing incentives. The pool weights of distribution speeds will be the same with $SONNE reward distribution speeds. 10% will be allocated to bribing USDC/SONNE pool on Velodrome Finance. 10% will be allocated to sSONNE and uSONNE staking reward pools.   5% will be allocated to boost development activity of Sonne Finance. (Article writings, twitter threads, dune analytics creations and UI design improvements.)  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? It will be distributed linearly for 6 months. Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism.  $100M Total Market Size in the first month (Already $43M) $300M Total Market Size in 3 months $500M Total Market Size in 6 months  One of the main reasons of this proposal is to have trust of Optimism governance, and assure users that Sonne is here to grow both Optimism\u2019s and its own TVL and activity. Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? Sonne is looking to incentivize the activity and providing liquidity at least for 3 years (even after the OP incentives end). Liquidity markets are great for single sided yields without impermanent loss, and enables other protocols to boost their activities (such as auto-compounders, or DeFi vaults). We believe that Optimism Mainnet will continue to be the top layer-2 and more opportunities will be created on Optimism in the future as well. Once users get used to a chain and love the community, they hardly move to another chain. We are also trying to be as fast and helpful as possible in our community channels to acquire that love and trust, both for the good sake of Sonne and Optimism. Last but not least, liquidity markets are one of the only protocols providing real yields for suppliers. We can see that with AAVE and Compound on Ethereum are very low on incentives, but they have more than $9B TVL combined on Ethereum Mainnet. We believe that we\u2019ll reach $1B to $2B level on Optimism within 2 years.

A much more safe metric is TVL which Sonne currently has 12.5M, still an impeccable growth over 13 days. Already 13th place on Optimism TVL. As such the milestones/KPI should be targeting TVL targets instead of Total Market Size. Currently the ask+timeline would mean around 10k OP distributed per week. Regarding the timeline I would reduce to 3 to 6 months. Consequently the ask should also be reduced in kind. Remember you can always re apply at a later date once we have confirmation of how the incentives panned out. As I shared on the discord, I am very happy with how the protocol managed the community questions in regards to the admin function administration, a multisig is a much safer option. ",

For example if there are $100M supply and $5M borrow, TVL would be $95M. Comparing this to $43M supply and $33M borrow, TVL would be 1/9 of the size of the previous example, but the second protocol is making 9-10 times more than the first one in protocol revenues, and i would make arguments that second one is healthier. There is not a single metric that is perfect for liquidity markets, but we had to choose one as a KPI. So we chose Total Market Size. We can choose TVL too, as we would have to adjust the targets. For the second part of the suggestion, yeah it makes sense. We edited our proposal to 250k OP for 6 months, and if it succeeds, we can make another proposal.

Here\u2019s a few notes to help you improve your proposal:     SonneFinance:  Is this project be open sourced? Yes    I have tried looking up your source code, but found your github repo empty. Can you please include links to your code?      SonneFinance:  95% will be allocated to lending/borrowing and staking rewards in order to boost activity. (40% - 40% - 10% - 10% to Lending \u2013 Borrowing \u2013 Staking \u2013 Velodrome Bribes)      Clarify how the allocation for borrowing and lending are distributed to each pool. Are they all split equality between all your pools? Clarify which token will be incentives with 10% of the grant received Clarify which pool will you incentive bribing on Velodrome    If there\u2019s other team members in your team, list them in your proposal   Your value proposition is strong, considering both your speed at your launch and your ability to understand the ecosystem broadly. I think the main concern that you might receive from delegates and the committee is the long term commitment to Soone, given that you have just launched a few weeks ago. My feedback is to you is to prove them that you are in it for the long haul.  Your partnership with velodrome is a great start. Continue building relationships as time goes by Show your source code on your github or add the relevant missing links What\u2019s next for Soone? How will it be bring innovative lending market product? How will it achieve its goal of $1B to $2B level TVL within 2 years on Optimism? Consider writing a few words about this in your proposal  ",

The draft will be edited by the time! They will be aligned with the current weight of the pools for SONNE distribution speeds. The future holds if there will be new collaterals/assets in the protocol, but the $OPs will be rewarded based on their weights for speeds at the time. For example right now, stablecoins have each 3/16 weight and wETH and OP have 2/16 weight respectfully. ( If 3 $SONNE is going to sUSD reward pool, 2 $SONNE is going to wETH reward pool, so if 3 $OP is going to sUSD supply incentive pool, 2 $OP will go to wETH supply incentive pool). SONNE/USDC pool on Velodrome will be incentivized with 10%. Updating the draft. Updating the other team members as well. Our long-term goal is to align not just accepting tokens like ETH/OP but liquid financial NFTs to be accepted in our lending protocol. For example, when veVELO is liquid enough (probably not happening in short term), we will consider listing it as a collateralizable asset. This will also enable us to accept real world assets (like real estate) in the very long term. We are already brainstorming and in touch with Turkish real estate exchange but this will take a very long time as well. We think and believe that in order for blockchains and DeFi to achieve its full potential, it needs to start gaining traction in areas where it hasn\u2019t already touched. We are here not just to provide on-chain solutions, but experiment on off-chain ramp. But for now, we are sticking to the safest approach possible. For Sonne to achieve $1B to $2B level, Optimism ecosystem needs to gain traction as well. Vampiring AAVE will not be enough for us. We believe that incentives are running the market for now, and Optimism grants are doing a great work onboarding new builders, but the ecosystem in general lacks incentives for onboarding new users. With the unique staking model of ours, we are able to offer good incentives while holding the price of the token (it\u2019s traded more than the LGE price), and 20% yield on stablecoins like USDC is just hard to deny. We already partnered up with Reaper Farm, and will be partnering up with Beefy which enables huge crowd action towards Optimism ecosystem, and Sonne. Thanks for the suggestions again, editing the draft, and will appreciate the future feedbacks as well! If there are still questions on your mind, or if our answers didn\u2019t satisfy, we\u2019ll try to answer them again! ",

The value-add of Sonne & the proposal to Optimism is not yet clear to us though. Value-add     SonneFinance:  Similar to (and based from) existing lending platforms, users will be able to lend any supported assets on our platform, and use their capital to borrow supported assets.       SonneFinance:  Sonne innovates on revenue sharing and tokenomics, where stakers of the protocol gets 2 different type of revenues (VELO and SONNE or USDC), as well as being able to choose the reward asset between SONNE and USDC.   As mentioned, Sonne seems to optimize tokenomics but on the product side you seem to not add value or fill an unexplored niche in the current lending ecosystem on Optimism considering that  Aave, Hundred Finance, Iron Bank, Granary etc. offer already the same or more lending markets with deep enough liquidity for anyone to borrow Stablecoins such as Angle & yield farming/leverage platforms such as Homora & especially Tarot also offer lending for important tokens and in the case of Tarot for more \u201cexotic\u201d tokens/pairs.  Incentives     SonneFinance:  Lending/borrowing protocols are the basis of DeFi, and currently there is no native lending protocol besides Sonne Finance. Being native to Optimism gives us the power of using our tokens to incentivize lending and borrowing heavily.   In our opinion, for liquidity incentives, Optimism should ask for co-incentives. As an Optimism project, and based on your existing distribution schedule, you are dedicating a large amount of your supply. However, the marketcap is $500K which means it may not last long & we cannot really count on these co-incentives. The stated KPIs are ambitious, we see utilization is high, and you\u2019re on a good way to reach your first goal. However, we should ask whether this recursive farming is a good KPI to optimize for and IF we should further incentivize TVL growth with Op tokens? Roadmap of Sonne (might help us understand future value-add)     SonneFinance:  We\u2019ll open the github repo by the time this proposal is up for voting.       SonneFinance:  Our long-term goal is to align not just accepting tokens like ETH/OP but liquid financial NFTs to be accepted in our lending protocol. For example, when veVELO is liquid enough (probably not happening in short term), we will consider listing it as a collateralizable asset.   At this point, it looks hard to support this proposal in its current shape. Maybe some more insights on your near-term roadmap could help us better understand the value-add to Optimism. We see value in an Optimism-native lending product but further advances to the product etc. would likely be a key factor. ",

                    "content": "Hello @ScaleWeb3 and thanks for your appraisal, thoughts and criticism! We believe that it would be unfair to seperate tokenomics from the project, as it\u2019s one of the main reasons for this traction of Sonne Finance. Our ability to create demand for SONNE token, and SONNE staking is what enables us to grow while not destroying the token price. (LGE price was $0.04) Also with the current rate of utilization and total borrows, $250k/yr buying pressure for SONNE is there. (Not considering the VELO reward distribution.) We agree that we haven\u2019t launched an unexplored niche yet, but even now, SONNE is the best liquidity market for OP token. In just 3 weeks, we filled the gap of utilizing OP better than other examples in your message. And as we stated above, competition is healthier for both users and Optimism ecosystem rather than monopoly. Hundred Finance, Iron Bank, Granary etc. is here for longer than us, but had hard time to gather liquidity. This is the power of being native. Also, because we are native to Optimism, we can act fast and do updates faster than our competitors. This may not be an example for filling a gap, but for example, we integrated our pool on Velodrome in our website for ease of users on Optimism: https://sonne.finance/swap Also, wanted to add that Sonne is the only project among those that considering Optimism\u2019s unstable blocks per year in order to calculate the true APR (both supply/borrow and reward APR) for users. Tarot and Homora has isolated pools for leverage farming, so it\u2019s less dangerous for them to have \u201cexotic\u201d liquidity markets. Sonne adding those pairs would danger not just Sonne holders but whole liquidity suppliers. We\u2019ll add those tokens when they have good liquidity on Optimism. Sonne being native and being able to incentivize the activity on Optimism is another value proposition that is supported with the TVL growth on Sonne and Optimism since the day we launched. This short-term success already made an example for other teams to launch on Optimism. We are already in touch with two protocols (to be launched on Optimism as native protocols) to pass the knowledge and experience we had and are having. For co-incentives part; our liquidity from LGE was locked in Velodrome Finance for 6 months and this locked liquidity makes 71% of SONNE/USDC pool and has $125k USDC in the pool. Even everything goes bad, even without considering protocol revenue buying SONNE back, and even without considering VELO distribution incentives for SONNE stakers, our co-incentives will be equal to 75% of asked OP. Based on current trend, the co-incentives will be 819% of asked OP. TVL is one of the biggest marketing tool for DeFi ecosystem and growth of Optimism. Just to give an example to this, a user opening the DefiLlama to see what\u2019s happening in Defi in general, he/she will see this:  image1346\u00d767 9.86 KB  Being in the first eight or not in TVL is a huge difference there for appearance. And it\u2019s just one example. Also, more TVL equals better liquidity and more usage. Although it\u2019s overrated in general, we believe that TVL growth\u2019s importance should not be underrated either. Proposal\u2019s first edit was asking 500k OP for 1 year, and we edited that for 6 months and half the OP asked. Near-term roadmap looks like this:  We are in touch with QiDAO, and will discuss about how MAI can be utilized in Sonne Finance. We are in touch with DLC.Link, and will enable native BTC lending/borrowing on Optimism in 4-5 months. We are in touch with Synthetix to discuss how SNX can be utilized in Sonne Finance to help Synthetix\u2019s grow more on Optimism.  We are in touch with two of the biggest banks in Turkey and Turkish Real Estate Exchange for having collateralized NFT-based loans (for real estate) on-chain, but that doesn\u2019t look like to happen in near term. We are well-equipped for integrating financial NFTs (like veVELO) as collateral, but on-hold for a better environment to launch that. Thanks for the reply and thoughts, and will appreciate future feedbacks as well! If our answers didn\u2019t satisfy, we\u2019ll try to answer them again! ",

NFTs (or a better tech in the future) will represent most of real world assets, and people will be able to take loans against them. We are working and will continue to work towards this goal. Right now we are in education phase, as we first need to educate and convince those institutions to make this happen, and it\u2019s a very slow process. But if traditional banks accept real estate as collateral, why shouldn\u2019t we? If you were asking about financial NFTs, the NFTs need to be liquid in platforms like Quix. Let\u2019s say, volume of veVELO or Uniswap v3 LP positions grow a lot on NFT markets. The liquidation can be done with auctions or anyone can pay the borrowing amount to take the position. It has been done with normal NFTs (like BAYC etc.), but it was not a great idea to do so with those assets at that time, as it was endangering suppliers. The UI and UX should improve for the financial position sales. If NFT markets can achieve that, and if people start to trade those positions, and if the volume is good enough for us to integrate, there is no reason why those shouldn\u2019t be collateral. Though, the c-ratios will be very low at first in order to protect our suppliers. It will be a hard task to decide for c-ratios, interest rates etc. for every position for Uniswap v3, but it\u2019s not undoable. NFTs like veVELO won\u2019t be that hard though, so we\u2019ll probably add those first. (the NFTs that represent staking) ",

I had a vision for a long time for liquidity markets, and she was a very good full-stack developer according to our CTO at the time, so I offered her to study solidity/web3 development (specifically liquidity markets) instead of looking for a new job around 10 months ago. She took the offer, killed it and here we are working together to make Sonne shine. Hunger for success and hype of Ameterasu combined with the experience of Gathon made a great combination of a core dev team. ",

The git repo update does seem a bit important however. From what i\u2019ve gathered from the Sonne docs, the team token allotment has a 2 year linear vest with a 3 month cliff. This seems to show commitment to the project and OP eco. Allowing the community to run diff checks on the source and confirm the vesting contract(s) could be helpful in garnishing support. Hopefully the update indeed does take place soon and might be something that attracts a second delegate to put this to vote. A further note is that the current market size and TVL seems to be about 50% more than what is stated in the proposal. considering this, and the term asks in other proposals, I feel like 250k tokens over six months is more than reasonable. I could be crazy here, but even twice that amount is something I would not oppose although i\u2019m mostly a nobody in opinion weight. Six months imo is a very long time in the defi chrono bubble.

As an Optimism project, and based on your existing distribution schedule, you are dedicating a large amount of your supply. However, the marketcap is $500K which means it may not last long & we cannot really count on these co-incentives.   market cap is over 1 million. does that mean this figure has doubled to 2000% now?     SonneFinance:  How much will your project match in co-incentives? We are already incentivizing users to use Optimism and Sonne with 60% of our tokens, which equals to 1000% of requested OP tokens at current prices.   I feel like anyone that would have sold from that first big spike after the LGE, would have sold already. The sonne discord looks active and the recent PA seems to be organic in nature. Can never tell of course but i feel like all things considered with sonne on velo and tarot and the native staking apr on the sonne platform\u2026this trend in price appreciation could continue or at the very least hold current market cap.
