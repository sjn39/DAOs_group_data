                    "content": "Hi all, Excited to announce that Uniswap v3 is now live on Celo! Thanks to everyone in the Uniswap community for the support and approval of this deployment. Also, thank you to Uniswap Labs for all their help in the deployment. The Uniswap Labs team was instrumental in the entire process, from reviewing repos to providing technical support to cLabs. As part of our ReFi vision, the Celo Foundation and the Climate Collective have seeded liquidity for several pairs into Uniswap v3. Learn more in our Medium post here. We view ReFi beyond nature-backed assets to include local currencies, community-based finance, and universal basic income (currently working on a Medium piece on this topic which I hope to publish soon). Two leading ReFi projects on Celo, ReSource and impactMarket, also seeded some initial liquidity to support the launch of Uniswap v3 on Celo. The Celo Foundation and the Climate Collective are now in the process of supporting additional ReFi launches later this month and next month. There\u2019s a few items for next steps:  We\u2019re working through some minor bugs (Uniswap interface and wallet integrations). Hope to have these resolved soon LP management tools are launching soon on Celo to make it easier for users to serve as LPs as well as access future liquidity incentive campaigns. Cargo Protocol and Gamma Strategies are both expected to launch later this month. Once these protocols are ready, the Celo Foundation can begin liquidity incentives. The market is significantly different from when Blockchain at Michigan and the Celo Foundation put forward the original Uniswap x Celo proposal, and so we\u2019d love to discuss with the Uniswap community how you\u2019re seeing effective liquidity incentive campaigns that support new token launches. We\u2019ve started discussing some of this with Blockchain at Michigan. We may also look to extend the overall length of liquidity incentives in order to promote healthy adoption of new ReFi launches rather than quick hold and dump scenarios. We\u2019re in the process of discussing a multisig for a portion of the liquidity incentives and the climate impact assessment. More to come on this soon.  Lastly, we hope to support future Uniswap cross-chain deployments. I\u2019ve reached out to several folks in the Uniswap community to discuss this. In the meantime please do reach out if you have any questions. I can be reached on this forum or on Twitter at @pumpernikhil. Thank you! Nikhil Raghuveera Celo Foundation ",
