                    "content": " Wednesday 18th May Executive: DssCure Technical Enhancement Maker\u2019s multichain initiative, now known as Maker Teleport, will be bringing canonical DAI capability onto layer two domains. As part of this development, it is necessary to introduce a new module called DssCure and update the existing End module in order to be able to interact with it.  Summary DssCure is a technical module that will calculate how much debt exists across layer2 domains and therefore how much collateral is available for redemption through the End in the event of emergency shutdown. It does this by discounting certain existing but unused pre-minted debt from the Vat to ensure correct calculation. This function is necessary when DAI is pre-minted on the TeleportJoin for L2 lending - and is therefore not to be considered in circulation at the time of shutdown. Similarly, this capability is also necessary for the slow path (7 days) to be able to discount the amount of DAI withdrawn but not yet settled.  Motivation If emergency shutdown were to occur, the End module would calculate the amount of collateral to be provided to DAI holders for each unit of DAI that they hold. This value is calculated in the End.flow(ilk) function based on the End.debt() value which is set at thaw() execution. The motivation for including the Cure module is to sit between the End and the Vat to account for the value of DAI out of circulation, thereby ensuring a fair distribution to DAI holders.  Detail The Cure module includes the capability to add or remove DAI sources from circulation. For L2 \u2192 L1 Teleport this will include the TeleportJoin. Future L2-to-L2 capabilities will require additional modules to be considered in a later deployment. In the future, these sources will determine how much DAI needs to be subtracted from the final End.debt() amount, and will be added by Governance. If emergency shutdown were to occur, it will be possible to permissionlessly load() the current cure() values from the different sources to get a final value that the module will provide to the End by using the tell() function. The tell() function will revert until all the sources are loaded or until the wait time has passed. As part of this enhancement, the ESM will also be updated with permissions for the new End. ",

                    "content": " Wednesday 18th May Executive: Flash Mint Module Technical Enhancement  Enhanced Flash Mint Module As per the Flash Loan Debt Manipulation During ES Vulnerability Postmortem described earlier this year, we are taking this opportunity to deploy a new flash mint module to permanently resolve the issue.  Background & Summary The flash mint module - DssFlash, allows users to flash loan newly-minted DAI to be paid back at the end of a transaction. During a flash loan, the outstanding debt of the system is correspondingly increased. At a particular step of the Emergency Shutdown process called End.thaw(), this debt value is read and cached. Therefore, during the shutdown process, a malicious actor could have taken a flash loan (up to the maximum allowed size) via DssFlash and called this function in the same transaction, causing an erroneously high debt value to be recorded. This would have reduced the amount of collateral disbursed per-DAI compared to the \u201ccorrect\u201d value. Since this devalues post-shutdown DAI, the attacker could profit by shorting DAI prior to executing the attack.  Short-Term Resolution Already Implemented The attack has already been mitigated by deploying a permissionless keeper that allows DssFlash to be disabled after emergency shutdown. Because End.thaw() cannot be called for a period of time (currently 3 days) after shutdown is initiated, there is no real risk that a bad actor can trigger the exploit prior to disabling flash mints. This mitigation was chosen because it allowed the address of the deployed DssFlash contract, as well as the maximum loan size, to initially remain unchanged. This minimizes the impact to integrators using the flash mint module.  Permanent Resolution Proposed As Part This Executive Protocol Engineering is proposing to deploy a new flash mint module that prevents manipulation of Vat.debt before calling End.thaw() by checking vat.live in the event that Emergency Shutdown has been triggered. This is a simple but necessary addition and will not require the above short-term keeper (which serves to mitigate the risk on the existing module). This new module is also removing the fee parameter which has always been set to zero.  Implications & Ongoing Operation  Due to integrations and keepers that are using the existing flash mint module, Protocol Engineering has decided not to immediately deprecate the existing module. For the near-term, the legacy module and the new module will continue to run in parallel. As a result, the DAI limits for both modules will be reduced from the current 500 million DAI to 250 million DAI each. It will be possible for users to use both modules, hence the reduction in the threshold, effectively allowing the overall flash loan amount to remain as it is today. As usage migrates to the new module, the old module will be sunset and the DAI limit on the new module will be appropriately increased. Usage will be tracked and a timeline will be presented accordingly. Upon deployment, both modules will be available in the chainlog, as:  MCD_FLASH_LEGACY MCD_FLASH    ",
