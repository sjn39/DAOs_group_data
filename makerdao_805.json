Welcome to another Focus On call. This is episode #6. We have the pleasure of receiving the Data Insights CU. Tadeo, Piotr, Tomek, and Leo will be explaining what they do, how they provide value to the community and other CUs, and potentially discussing some of the updates to the budget. For those who do not know me, my name is Juan, the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling CU facilitator at MakerDAO. If anyone has any questions, please intervene politely. We will have much time in the end, but if there is something you would like to say and it is relevant, you can potentially interject. I do not think that the Data Insights CU guys will mind too much. For other episodes of FO, please check the forum.

Is it going to your website to see what datasets you have or what you would recommend? 19:49 - Juan: Is this data open to the community outside of MakerDAO, or do you need some code or password to access it and give it to any CU that requests that? 21:57 - Juan: On the cost side, you also have to run an archive note to access the blockchain. How do you manage those costs and ensure that they are transferred properly? 22:59 - Frank Cruz: I noticed that you have been posting on the forum about the possibility of working with the RWF team on doing some reporting, perhaps a data dashboard. Can anybody go on this dashboard and get an analysis monthly about how much RWA originators are lending, how much they are collecting, how many of the loans are in default, maybe they are 30 days late, 60 days late, etc.? Is that how you envision this dashboard? 25:30 - Frank Cruz: With all this data you are putting out there, like the MCD Voter Tracker, is there any way we can monetize this for the benefit of MKR token holders or MakerDAO soon? 26:23 - Frank Cruz: What is your thought process regarding capturing some API datasets from L2s like StarkNet shortly? 29:16 - Juan: I had a quick question regarding one of the graphics where the vaults were open, and I saw that one was MakerDAO. Was that Oasis, or what does MakerDAO mean in that context? 29:54 - Juan: Tadeo mentioned that you will be trying to digitize the data coming from RWA and that that might include a lot of pdfs. How are you planning on doing this? Is it either hiring some solution to scan for documents or is it more like outsourcing everything to some third-world country? 31:35 - Juan: Regarding the budget, there were many concerns raised by the community members. Do you want to address those or comment on them? 32:33 - Juan: One of the comments was about potentially posting a budget to keep operations running and doing this separately. Is that something that you are considering? 33:52 - Juan: How would things look if this budget gets voted down and things stay as they were voted four months ago. What would that look like for MakerDAO? 35:35 - Many of the new mandates involve RWA and L2, where Maker is still not very present. Would you consider as a team waiting for this budget until Maker is there, or is it something that you want to start before for any given reason? 36:49 - PaperImperium: Would separate increases for L2 and RWA be brought forward to separate them if this gets voted down? 38:09 - Kianga Daverington: Do you have data on the visibility of your different websites, and who is using the information? 42:34 - Juan : What is the best way of reaching you?  Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 43:16  Thank you to everyone for joining. It was great having you. Let us keep the discussions going at forum.makerdao.com.
