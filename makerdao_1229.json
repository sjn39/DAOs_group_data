                    "content": "Unified Auctions UI Release v1.4.0 - June 10th 2022 Version: v1.4.0 Name: Concept Art Gallery  v1.4.0 in a nutshell Another 2 weeks has passed already, and we are happy to announce release v.1.4.0 of the Unified Auctions UI. This sprint we pushed forward the concept for the implementation of the flap auction in order to start implementing with the start of the new sprint next week Monday. Additionally, we introduced automated end-to-end testing flows for the UI and improved error handling in order to improve the UX in case of failed transactions. This sprint focuses in particular on the concept for implementing flap auctions. So, what name could fit better than Concept Art Gallery? Exactly none!  A closer look at changes  End-to-end tests We always want to ship high-quality code and ensure robustness with sophisticated tests. This is why we have introduced testing scenarios to automatically check for functionality of the core flow of the UI. On a high level during our end-to-end test we install metamask, spawn a hardhat simulation and execute relevant transactions. In the current testing flow, we first interact with an active auction via flash lending and afterwards with the received Dai bid on another auction. This way we ensure to automatically test the two core flows of collateral auction participation including the required authorization steps. Cypress is the tool of our choice for the implementation of the tests. The last outstanding piece that is currently tackled is the integration of these tests into our CI pipeline. Of course, we will adjust our testing flows for each new feature that will be released to the Unified Auctions UI in the future.  Improved error handling  Error_message_parsed1758\u00d7392 420 KB  Not knowing what is going on while interaction with an application is the worst feeling you can have as a user. Right from the beginning, we wanted to prevent this situation with toast notification that inform a user on the current state of the transaction or provide an error in case something went wrong. Unfortunately, we experienced quite some situation where we only displayed \u201cUnknown error\u201d messages. This is not the level of guidance and user feedback that we are striving for. The problem was that error messages from the RPC come in unstructured form (text + json in one variable). Hence, we have improved our error parser and now display more speaking error messages to the user. (See the red error message for the user in the screenshot above, with its corresponding error message from RPC in black)  Flap auction implementation concept  Surplus_Auction_Mock1920\u00d71603 156 KB  When tackling a larger new feature, the process we are following always starts with a proper conceptualization. So, we did in the last sprint for the flap auctions and ended up with a first Mockup for the UI and an overall implementation plan. Feel free to have a glimpse on the Mock (note: can still be subject to change) here. Since the discussion on flap auctions in general is ongoing, we are aiming for a lean and flexible but still robust implementation. For example, this is achieved by re-using a lot of the existing components that have been implemented for the flip auctions already. ",
