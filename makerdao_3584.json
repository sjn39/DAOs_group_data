                    "content": "If my favorite Thought Leader could write the Maker Community a letter: \u201cTo win in business you need to do more than to play the game well. You need the edge. So how do you get the edge? You remain on constant alert. You continuously learn from your experiences as well as others, so you can make your business win no matter how fluid the situation gets. The edge is about shaping things by taking the initiative rather than being a reactor. And it\u2019s about keeping your offense on the field as much as you can while forcing your competition to play defense, always. When you have the edge you realize that the business you\u2019re in, is not just about you and your team and the rules and how they are defined today. It\u2019s about the competition around you and your determination to win. In our conversation, Marc Cuban describes this as kicking your own ass. So how do you kick your own ass to sharpen your edge? There are many ways but 3 stand out in particular. The first is Will. Will power involves two things. The first is the willingness to prepare. And the second is the grit to see things thru. Marc Cuban said that legendary Indiana basketball Coach Bobby Knight once told him, \u201clots of people have the desire to win, maybe even the will to win. But very few people have the will to prepare to win.\u201d You can\u2019t just will your way to victory without having a plan that plays to your strength and your competitors weaknesses. Having the will to prepare to win means having clear goals. It also means getting real about identifying obstacles and problems that stand in your way. Which leads to the second key part of the edge. Focus. In any startup or any business, there\u2019s a battle being fought that above all battles, is the one you must win. The one that maters more that all the others. As the leader you must make sure you know which battle this is and that you focus on winning it above all other things. As a leader you should only be focus on how to fight this one battle that comes to your Core Units. If there\u2019s other battles that matter too, delegate. And Even then, Mark Cuban said to have a single leader for every battle. Someone who can bring the same level of maniacal focus and intensity. Which brings me to the third part of the Edge, constant competitor awareness. In our discussion Mark emphasized that you always want to think how a giant competitor can put you out of business. If your as a reader of this post and are leading a Core Unit right now and you don\u2019t have an answer to this question, you\u2019re subjecting your Core Unit to unacceptable risk. It\u2019s easy in the early days to think that our product (DAI) is great before we have competition gunning for us. But we shall always ask, \u201chow can a company enter our Market and crush us?\u201d \u2014Mike Maples, Jr. ",
