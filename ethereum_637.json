(1) Which means that before then, the EIP must be in Draft, brought up at a CoreDevs agenda, and acknowledged to be Accepted if non-controversial? Or (2), the EIP must be in Draft, and a PR against 1679 to propose it for inclusion? PR remains open until such time implementations of two major clients are completed, EIP itself could be Draft or Accepted. If so, I would suggest \u2013 if there is need / interest in meeting in person \u2013 that a meeting happen no later than April 17th, 2019, one month before the proposal deadline.

In practice, I think Last Call / Accepted and proposal / acceptance into the Hardfork meta have some wiggle room to happen in parallel. @5chdn\u2019s wording in the roadmap was more about signaling that teams were going to try to get EIP XXXX into the hardfork, and propose it to the client teams. I think Paris is unlikely to be anything other than an ad-hoc meeting \u2013 hence trying to determine when the next scheduled meeting should be. BUT \u2013 I think it would be super helpful to have an EIP process discussion. We can have that during Council of Prague / EthMagicians (added to Rings HackMD).

You write a proposal, request a two-week review and then emerge from the review unscathed. This is all spelled out here EIP-1: EIP Purpose and Guidelines   There is a lot of confusion around this because Core protocol changes are EIPs, and contract standards and RPC apis and so forth are also EIPs (\u201cnot core EIPs\u201d). When this change to EIP-1 was made last year, I thought it was a typo that was overlooked by some EIP editors:      Accepted (Core EIPs only) \u2013 A successful Last Call without material changes or unaddressed technical complaints will become Accepted.   Final (Not core EIPs) \u2013 A successful Last Call without material changes or unaddressed technical complaints will become Final.    The process as described there conflicts with the definitions of the terms stated on the README, and with the actual process of getting EIPs adopted. Here\u2019s the terms on the README (full disclosure: I wrote these):     Draft  - an EIP that is open for consideration.  Accepted  - an EIP that is planned for immediate adoption, i.e. expected to be included in the next hard fork (for Core/Consensus layer EIPs).    So there are two definitions of Accepted for Core EIPs now:   The one stated in EIP-1. Accepted only means the Core EIP went through a two week \u201clast call\u201d phase before its status was upgraded to Accepted.   The one stated in the readme. Core EIPs are updated from Draft to Accepted after AllCoreDevs reach provisional agreement (by rough consensus) to schedule it for adoption in the next fork.   Also in EIP-1:   Accepted (Core EIPs only) \u2013 This EIP is in the hands of the Ethereum client developers. Their process for deciding whether to encode it into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the EIP process.   From what I recall of the discussion around that update to EIP-1, that change was made because some people wanted to make the EIP process explicit and formal (there was even an earlier version of EIP-1 that was mistakenly merged, which stated that EIPs are accepted after a \u201cvote\u201d). But since the AllCoreDevs process is informal and resistant to structure, they hoped that AllCoreDevs would define/document their own process, separately from the EIP process. (at least that\u2019s how I remember it. Maybe others had a different rationale for wanting to consider AllCoreDevs as a separate process which shouldn\u2019t be documented in EIP-1). That never really happened, I guess because it would require AllCoreDevs to start using a new term to mean \u201crough consensus was reached on AllCoreDevs\u201d (currently they use Accepted to mean this). It was also confusing because the original point of EIPs was for core devs to document changes to the core protocol (hence the whole category of \u201cCore\u201d EIPs). Later, contract devs began to use EIPs to document contract standards. Then a change to EIP-1 is made stating that the process around Core EIPs isn\u2019t an EIP process, and so EIP-1 isn\u2019t the right place to document how Core EIPs progress from Draft to adoption on the mainnet. So I don\u2019t know, either someone needs to tell the Core Devs that they should stop using EIPs to schedule core protocol changes and that they need their own separate process (in alignment with the current version of EIP-1; and the EIPs readme should be updated so that it is consistent with EIP-1.). Or EIP-1 should attempt to describe the AllCoreDevs process around Core EIPs, using the same terminology that core devs use. I\u2019d prefer the latter, which is to write a descriptive document, i.e. describe the group\u2019s current behavior. The former requires forcing a group to change their current behavior (writing a document that prescribes new behavior), which is unlikely to be successful. ",

And subsequently I am responsible for the inconsistency and all confusion. Sorry! Here\u2019s how it happened and where I think we can go. I was very involved when getting ERC-721 through. And I promised everybody that I would do whatever necessary to get it done, even if that means fixing EIPs and Solidity and 165 and anything we depended on. I quickly learned these facts about the EIP process.  EIP editors do not want to adjudicate EIPs \u2013 see @pirapira and many other discussion on EIP-1 PRs. Core Devs do not have the bandwidth to handle the amount of innovation coming through EIPs \u2013 see 721 review rejected from Core Dev project meetings. Drafts could suddenly become final based on editor whims. EIP editors do not care about forking block numbers  This next one is a logical conclusion of the above:  The EIP process applies to Ethereum Classic, POA and other networks just as well as mainnet.  I implemented (this might be contentious) these changes:   Everything goes through a two week review process (idea stolen wholesale from Swift Evolution process) The two week review is attached to an RSS feed Encourage people to see the RSS feed  I hope I can have your support to update the README to match this process. This would mean:  Update README Let AllCoreDevs use any language they want. But they should publish their own page (outside of EIPs) to mention Accepted EIPs which are under development. (Idea stolen from Swift Evolution process). Invite other core dev teams to emerge and implement whatever they want.   I could not achieve consensus to implement the following changes. But I\u2019ll proceed and try again if somebody with commit access gives me the green light (plus a little coaching) and/or if my PR on EIP-1 is accepted:  Mandate discussion for all last reviews to occur on a specific, canonical place which is archived. (Idea stolen wholesale from Swift Evolution.) (That place would be here, Ethereum Magicians.) Rename Core EIPs -> EIPS, ERCs to ERCs. Remove categories. Note that state changes would not count as EIPs ore ERCs. And then SAY NOTHING FURTHER ON THAT TOPIC. (This closes two specific EIPs as out of scope.) Make a separate page to track EIP deployments on various networks (deployment block numbers). Close GitHub Issues and direct a canonical place for discussions. (That place would be here, Ethereum Magicians.)   I will run out of steam and stop pushing this agenda. So if I\u2019m bothering people, just wait and I\u2019ll go away. But if people want me to be involved I\u2019ll need a little validation at some point and resources. ",

Yep, totally agree: describe the behaviour and tweak it over time \u2013 so there is a bit of push and pull. So, ideally for Core EIPs: Draft -> Last Call --> Accepted -> Final Where Accepted means \u201cthere are no technical issues and this will make it into some hardfork\u201d. And inclusion in a hardfork is by adding an Accepted EIP to the Hardfork Meta EIP. And that bar - of making it into a Hardfork \u2013 needs some outside the EIP work, like implementation in at least two major clients. Is that about right? Personally, I\u2019d also like to see changes to the Jello Paper / Yellow Paper made (or at least active PRs) before acceptance into a Hardfork Meta. This does mean that we will continue to have lots and lots of Drafts. It means that Last Call becomes a point of forcing the issue of really reviewing if there are issues with a Core EIP. ",

In practice, this is the year where many other networks are going to have to make some choices around following main-net. None of the other networks currently use anything other than the Jello Paper / Yellow Paper and related other Ethereum specs (devp2p, JSON-RPC, etc. etc.) as reference documents.     fulldecent:  Accepted EIPs which are under development. (Idea stolen from Swift Evolution process).   This is the Hardfork Meta EIP \u2013 so it is within the EIP process but essentially informational. For Constantinople, there was a \u201ctracking\u201d Github page to track process of various clients. I like the Hardfork Meta \u2013 means one less system to track. I don\u2019t think kicking CoreDevs out of the EIP process for some meta system makes any sense whatsoever. ",

Also, you keep saying \u201cEF Core Devs\u201d \u2013 which is not actually a thing. Pegasys and Parity (as examples) aren\u2019t part of the EF. Ethereum main-net Core Devs might be a better label \u2013 aka chain ID 1, network ID 1 (plus various test nets whose purpose is to test releases before main-net). And as I pointed out earlier, Ethereum Classic does not follow / acknowledge the EIP process, they have an ECIP process of their own, which is different. In any case \u2013 as @cdetrio said, aligning README and EIP-1 and actual process to date is a good thing. I\u2019ll put this on my backlog to roll a PR. And, would be great to discuss live in Paris.

Last year all the in-person meetings were semi-private, invite only, and organized relatively last minute.

The idea is to have more opportunities to discuss, even in smaller region-specific groups. That said, final decisions should not be made at these meetings, rather they\u2019re places for folks to get together and discuss ideas in a high-bandwidth, high-focus way. In person meetings will happen on or off the books, and the more transparent, open, frequent, and   they are the better IMO. I would love to see this whole process made more remote friendly. Live streaming portions of Stanford was a step in the right direction, but it would be good to find a way to dial folks in (hard, but we\u2019re a community that prides itself on solving hard problems!)
