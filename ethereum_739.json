                    "content": "Hi everyone, To better manage the security risks in the Ethereum Change Management Process we propose a change to the EIP minimum requirements to include a mandatory \u201cSecurity Considerations\u201d section for the documentation of security relevant information directly with the EIP. This proposal is adapted from the IETF\u2019s Request for Comments (RFC) system (RFC 7322 - Section 4.8.5) where this is mandatory already. The Meta EIP is currently in Draft status. We would love to get you involved making this a community effort and being excellent in integrating security into one of our most important processes. To kick off a discussion please have a look at the Draft Meta EIP - \u201cSecurity Considerations\u201d and provide feedback to help shape the specification in a way that introduces minimal overhead while having the most positive effect on change management security.  Where to begin?  Review the Draft Meta EIP - \u201cSecurity Considerations\u201d  the complete list of changes \u2192 diff    Add something to the general discussion? \u2192 Post it right here  Note that some discussion points are marked DISCUSS or TODO in the draft   Want to propose concrete changes? \u2192 File a PR on github   To keep EIPs clear and simple we propose a two-step approach first introducing the mandatory section (this Meta EIP) and then providing tailored guidance with an informational EIP following the RFCs approach. looking forward to a fruitful discussion  cheers, tin   EIP Excerpt  Simple Summary This document describes an improvement to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) system as defined in EIP-1, so that all EIPs MUST include a \u201cSecurity Considerations\u201d section. Requirements include discussion of security considerations in the design, indicating which aspects of the protocol may be affected (networking, virtual machine, etc.), listing risks and how they have been mitigated. This proposal is adapted from the IETF\u2019s Request for Comments (RFC) system (RFC 7322 - Section 4.8.5).  Benefits:  visibility and easy access to security relevant design decisions/implications/information documented, summarised and linked with the proposal allows to shift focus and efforts following a security triage of proposed changes surfaces risks, outline their treatment or reasoning behind accepting risks provides input to reviewers and potential follow-up activities (e.g. security assessments) encourages authors to explicitly consider security in the design and outline their reasoning fosters an open and informed security discussion allows to give security related guidance, information on potential pitfalls to implementers (e.g. when a change can likely introduce a vulnerability)   Abstract The EIP system defines a minimum set of information and criteria to be included in a proposal. Security discussions take place but important considerations are not always documented with the EIP. Furthermore, security-related information and design decisions might blend into technical documentation, lacking visibility and not being easily available for the security community posing a greater threat for changing security aspects to not be considered in later phases of the EIP (e.g. implementation phase).

Having security information ready and conserved where change is happening also provides input to security relevant EIP process or follow-up activities  and reserving time for a security review of critical changes is important. @souptacular - Sounds good! We\u2019ve compiled this EIP under the assumption that \u2026  changes to the process require an EIP to be accepted and change should ideally be accompanied with more information outlining the motivation behind and giving some initial guidance as well.  As part of this we have already proposed changes to EIP-1 and we are very happy to either create a PR to kick off a series of general changes to EIP-1 (w/o an EIP) or ideally referenced to this EIP (basically the diff we\u2019ve posted already). guidance welcome! @dguido - Happy to have you and others not limited to the security community on board! As initially mentioned we are proposing a two-step approach following RFCs introduction:  (short term: meta EIP) implementing the \u201cSecurity Considerations\u201d into EIP-1 with initial guidance on what should be considered, intentionally keeping it relaxed. (mid term: info EIP) provide guidance on how to write \u201cSecurity Considerations\u201d text for EIPs tailored to the ethereum ecosystem, defining relevant terminology, outlining \u201cthe ethereum threat model\u201d inspired by \u201cthe internet threat model\u201d, common security pitfalls relevant for EIPs, important information that should be included that can be used for follow-up processes and providing example text for writing good \u201cSecurity Considerations\u201d. I strongly believe that it is important to provide information in a digestible way causing as little friction as possible as the main process is still proposing change and not causing an overkill by having everyone doing security assessments  while making sure information is readily available.  For the 2nd part we definitely need input from the security community and EIP authors and tailoring this to useful guidance for EIP authors will likely take some time. I\u2019d be happy to form a working group or whatever needed to kick that off  ad this EIP: Since I am quite new to the EIP process I\u2019d love to get some guidance on how to move this process forward as I believe the earlier we get this into the process the better it is for the ecosystem. cheers, tin ",

I\u2019m trying to point at a security concern that I think gets under-appreciated. Some of the things people propose, if they succeed, would destroy the chain by polluting the commons.
