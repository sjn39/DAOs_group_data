Reason Details Since 24k MKR voted for Approve reduced budget - BearMarket, we request 6,600(6 months)(1.1 contingency) = 43,560 DAI.  Surplus Analysis As of 02 Dec 2022, our auditor wallet contained 740,396 DAI and 0.32 ETH. Assuming that our auditor returns the balance to the protocol then the proposed transfer can be taken from the current surplus.  DAI Transfer Ceiling Analysis The proposed transfer is well below the DAI Transfer Ceiling (250,000 DAI).  Targets Recipient is the Immunefi Security CU Auditor Multi-sig Wallet. Recipient Address: 0xd1F2eEf8576736C1EbA36920B957cd2aF07280F4 Amount To Transfer: 43560 DAI   Relevant Information:  Immunefi Security CU Update for November  ",

So far, all MIP14 requests combined do not exceed the MIP14c4: Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling, which is currently set to 250,000 DAI. Therefore, this proposal is eligible. The last IS-001\u2019s budget proposal was not approved by Governance. This request asks 43,560 DAI to fund IS-001\u2019s continuity work for six months until May 2023. As per MIP14c2, this subproposal is eligible to enter the Monthly Governance Cycle, after having fulfilled its four-week Feedback Period and its one-week Frozen Period. If this subproposal is ratified, 43,560 DAI will be transferred to the specified MIP47-compliant multisig wallet through the earliest executive vote. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  Disclaimer: These summaries are intended to be a guide and not a source of truth. You remain responsible for any actions you take on the grounds of this information. Please note the date when the summary was last updated to judge accuracy. Updated 2022-12-26 ",
