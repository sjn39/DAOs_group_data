Defi Smart Accounts are permissionless and non-custodial. Users will be able to set up refinance automation functionality in case of liquidation for ETH-A vaults into Aave, ETH-B or Compound. One of the Instadapp Gelato Automation smart contracts - ConditionMakerVaultUnsafe.sol (Edit: as @gitpusha mentioned in the comments - ConditionMakerVaultUnsafeOSM) - requires access to the Maker Oracle feed so that it may acquire and verify price data. This oracle will be used to facilitate automation on behalf of DSA users. The process of refinancing will be prioritized as follows (in case of ETH-A liquidation):-  Aave, but if no DAI liquidity then ETH-B vault, but if ceiling reached then Compound   Automation without oracle data: User selects a ratio at which they would want their ETH-A vaults to refinance. Automation with oracle data: ETH-A will only get refinanced if the ETH-A vault is about to get liquidated.   Oracle Name ETH/USD The contract to be whitelisted does neither return nor store the ETH/USD price. It reads and processes the price in-memory. Based on that in-place data processing it will only return either the string \u201cOK\u201d, if the inputted maker vault is about to get liquidated, or \u201cNOT OK\u201d, if the inputted maker vault is still safe. If the contract returns \u201cOK\u201d, the Gelato bots will automatically refinance the debt position. Therefore, no other contract can access the raw price data from the Maker Oracle via ConditionMakerVaultUnsafe. The oracle data is inherently permission only to the latter and thus we are confident that it meets all the requirements for whitelisting.  Customer(s) Instadapp \u2013 [email\u00a0protected] Gelato \u2013 [email\u00a0protected]  Whitelist ConditionMakerVaultUnsafe.sol \u2013 0x3b50336E3E1E618FE74DF351966ebaD2B12cD24a  Requirements For each customer address to be whitelisted: \u00b7 Is the contract source code verified on etherscan? Yes \u00b7 Is the Oracle data used in a permission manner that would prevent parasitic behaviour? Yes \u00b7 Is Oracle data written to storage? No \u00b7 If Oracle data is stored, is it stored in a private variable? n/a \u00b7 If Oracle data is stored, is the value accessible on-chain exclusively by the protocol? n/a  Fee In accordance with the Responsible Oracle Migration Proposal, fees are waived for the first year and determined by MKR Governance after that.

The use case we are targeting right now does not involve \u201cunwinding the position\u201d i.e. self-liquidation, it involves the refinancing to another protocol with lower collateral requirements. Let\u2019s say ETH price drops rapidly, leading to your ETH-A Vault becoming subject to liquidation in an hour and even if you refinance to ETH-B, given the current transaction fees  you would have to pay (which are usually very high when ETH price crashes and which you as the user have to pay for), your resulting refinanced position on ETH-B could still be in danger of being liquidated, because the price simply dropped very rapidly. Maybe not in next period, but latest in the price update period that follows if ETH continuous to drop. As we don\u2019t unwind the position, users will still get liquidated in ETH-B in that case. This scenario is what we want to avoid. Given these circumstances, the best option for the User is be refinanced to the where the lowest colla requirements are at that time to avoid being liquidated and needing to self liquidate in the first place. If we don\u2019t do that, users might end up being refinanced to ETH-B where they would still get liquidated + they had to pay a large transaction fee for the refinance, which would be very suboptimal. That is why we prioritise the destination of the refinance to the protocol which makes most sense given the changing market conditions at that time. In practice what will happen, some of the ETH-A vaults will be refinanced to Aave, some to ETH-B and some to Compound in times of price distress, all based on the available liquidity and what would the best option for the end-user at that time.  In the meantime I\u2019ve reviewed the contract and noticed the function used to query the Oracle price is publicly accessible  Yes they are, but as Samyak mentioned, the only thing that \u201cleeches\u201d could do is to know whether a certain Vault will be subject to liquidation in the next period or not. It is impractical to defer the price from that statement imo. If you still would like us to restrict knowing that only our use case can use the Condition contract, we could implement a simple require() in the view call, restricting it only to our system. Let me know whether you require that. Thanks! ",

Reason: in the current version this is a one-time automated refinancing only without any added automated liquidation protection via further consecutive debt refinancing or self-liquidation mechanisms thereafter. Therefore the destination of the refinancing should stay \u201csafe\u201d the longest under price crashes i.e. have the lowest collateral requirement.
