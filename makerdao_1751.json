This post is for anyone that might have missed the announcement, or otherwise doesn\u2019t follow the G&R calls  @Protocol-Engineering has expressed a desire to limit executives to every other week when possible to help manage dev bandwidth and keep costs associated with executive spells down. While we may not always be able to accommodate this wish (and will seek to amend our MIPs if this becomes formal practice) when appropriate we will opt for taking a week off of executives. As always, please feel free to use this thread to voice any questions, comments, or concerns. ",
