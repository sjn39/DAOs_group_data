This post is meant to be a knowledge transfer and represents my limited vantage point.  Please treat it as just a data point + part of the knowledge transfer.  Definitions   Socialware - Mechanisms that create assurances through human relationships, incurring a high social coordination cost.  Trustware - Mechanisms that create assurances through technology, incurring a low social coordination cost.  Hyperstructure - crypto protocols that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermediaries  Credit for these definitions: Orca: socialware to trustware , Zora: Hyperstructures.  TLDR Gitcoin started as socialware (high social coordination cost) + more trustware (low social coordination cost) has evolved over time. Once Trustware runs all of the core operations of Gitcoin\u2019s products, then Gitcoin is a hyperstructure (a crypto protocol that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermediaries). The four phases of this evolution of trust @ Gitcoin are:  Socialware Modular socialware Trustware at the center with socialware at the edges (hyperstructure phase) Growth via network effects  As Gitcoin Progressively decentralizes over time, I believe it\u2019ll move from centralization to a decentralized and modular set of protocol-based codebases.  The evolution of socialware => trustware of GitcoinDAO  Trustware1920\u00d71200 147 KB   The Gitcoin Hyperstructure As noted above, Hyperstructures are crypto protocols that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermediaries. Once Gitcoin Grants is run primarily on trustware, I believe that it has fully become a Hyperstructure. Here is a more-artistic (and less technical) visualization of the Gitcoin Hyperstructure by IamJvck, created via this design bounty.  180141183-620ba87c-8c8e-40db-88a0-ea797280ef5b1920\u00d71920 220 KB  ",

I think all DAOs need to be moving in this direction constantly to take advantage of the technology platform they\u2019re built on to allow the organization to scale without compromising values/mission. Big opportunity for GitcoinDAO to be a leader in showing the DAO space in general the way to the next level! ",

Given data science model drift, you may want iterative socialware where humans keep tuning the models and deploying them to trustware.

I think our focus on the next few months are clarifying, but is it time we think about the DAO post stabilization?  What are the necessary components,  what is the protocol governance structure, and what forms do the remaining supporting structures look like in order to deliver the hyperstructure?   The importance of the network in the realization of the hyperstructure.  This feels topical because I think we just defunded the \u201cengage the community\u201d surface.  I think for the network effect to happen we can deliberately leverage a community of hard core fanatics, or buy eyeballs.   Q1: Is someone working on these things already?

Gitcoin chose the path of salaries, but that was at the expense of decentralization and the potential to be a hyperstructure.

Q3: who do you think should take the lead for driving these conversations (org structure post stabilization, community engagement)   I raised this in a different yet similar context: S17 Musing - Gitcoin's \"Most important Thing\" - #4 by tigress \u2026 with a little bit of a twist: less from the perspective of Community Engagement and more based on the craft of Token Engineering.   As a protocol DAO with an impact arm, shouldn\u2019t we look more at how the relationships between the 3 most important things outlined above are intended to develop: Which incentives (utility) drive which behaviours and how the protocols interact in order to enable a thriving ecosystem?  And interestingly, Shawn, your own personal reflection on refactoring Gitcoin makes me aware of what is stopping me from empowering myself, initiating and wanting to co-own this work and moving forward with accountability to make it happen: I fear that this work \u201ctowards a hyperstructure\u201d  does not matter / is not valued fear this work is not inline with other ideas somewhere else fear my work is going to be torpedoed at the 11th hour by some last moment dismissal  From my empowered stance I can overcome #1 and #2 but the number 3 has continuously worsened throughout the past year(!) and is not under my control. Contributing factors are:  Wild-wild west (combative) style of managing expressed as e.g. hostile commenting on this forum Changes in GTC delegations and therefore continuously discontinuous top-level leadership direction and alignment Lack of meaningful feedback and inspection and adaption on the whole-system level  I highly encourage the reader to dig into this underlying, very human \u201cwild wild west\u201d drama and the very natural feelings of unworthiness, blaming and trying to compensate and protect (in times of scarcity). And to even further explore the concept of psychological safety at work.    conscious.is    The Drama Triangle | Conscious Leadership Group Learn the about the roles that keep you stuck in the drama triangle and have you repeating issues in your life. Also learn about the roles that support you in living in presence where you can permanently solve your life's challenges.
