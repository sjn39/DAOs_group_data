                    "content": "Hey all! Key stakeholders use the weekly Cross Stream DAO Operations (CSDO) calls to voice their opinions in the decision-making processes used to steer the DAO toward its purpose & essential intents. These calls aim to maximize workstream buy-in and minimize unproductive time spent on executing ideas without key stakeholder approval. Each month, I will be compiling a summary of the decisions made in these calls and adding them to this post to improve transparency into how the DAO is collectively deciding to move toward our goals. You can find the CSDO meeting notes, current projects, and all decisions proposed during these calls in the CSDO Notion Page.   DECISIONS SUMMARY FOR JUNE 2022  1.  Delay S15 Start by One Month (to August) Meeting Notes: CSDO (Cross Stream DAO Ops) #37 Outcome: Passed   Outcome Summary This proposal passed. The S15 dates will remain the same, and the budget proposal timelines will be delayed by one month. Workstreams will use their reserves to bridge the gap. The next budgets proposed will be for 6 months, with a 3 month check-in.  2. Standardize a Set Norm Across the DAO (Suggest - Agreement to lessen volitility risk for workstreams when posting budget requests) Meeting Notes: CSDO (Cross Stream DAO Ops) #38 Outcome: Passed   Outcome Summary This proposal passed, and a set standard will be set to accommodate the effects of volatility on the funds received by workstreams. The standard will be to use the 20 day moving average of $GTC. The GTC total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally. The vote will be to send $xxx,xxx in GTC at either the current price or the 20 day moving average (whichever is lower).   DECISIONS SUMMARY FOR MAY 2022  1.  Hire a Scribe to attend CSDO calls Meeting Notes: CSDO (Cross Stream DAO Ops) #30 Outcome: Passed   Outcome Summary The proposal passed and Kyle Jensen was hired as the dedicated Scribe.  2. Delay Move to Snapshot by One Week Meeting Notes: CSDO (Cross Stream DAO Ops) #30 Outcome: Passed   Outcome Summary The proposal passed, and the process for moving budget proposals to Snapshot will be delayed until next week to allow stewards more time to meaningfully dive into budget requests. This also delays the execution of transfers into workstream multisigs by ~a week.  3.
