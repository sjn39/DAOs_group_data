                    "content": "Following a comment by @PaperImperium and @alexis in several other threads as well as the ridiculous rate at which the PSM is filling up, here\u2019s an idea to start removing USDC from the PSM. I have to admit this is kind of vague at the moment because I don\u2019t yet understand fully how our RWA vaults work but hopefully the @Real-World-Finance guys can comment about what obstacles stop us from this. The goal would be to have a USD bank account serve as a Real World Asset with stability fees slightly set to be slightly lower than prevailing interest rates. I don\u2019t know how hard this is to achieve but if our RWA framework is able to handle this, the account owner is then able to deposit a small amount of seed USD, generate DAI, sell it on the open market for profit and receive USD, put that USD back into the account and repeat the process as long as DAI trades above $1. I\u2019m sure we\u2019d have lots of people who want to take advantage of such an arbitrage opportunity with zero risk. While this idea is still at a very early stage, the idea of replacing an additional PSM middleman entity (Circle for USDC, Binance for BUSD, etc.) is quite appealing to me. We would end up holding large amounts of USD in a bank account (or mutliple accounts) instead of stablecoins in PSMs but risk wise, most people might find this more palatable. The fact that the stability fees are nonzero also means more revenue than the one time fees we get from the PSM. And lastly, we lost the bad PR of being a \u201cUSDC wrapper\u201d. ",

So high complexity, low reward, and not enough smart contract work (we are a blockchain protocol after all).

I agree that they they keep all the reward currently, but as there is none those days, it doesn\u2019t really matter. This is why I tend more to diversify our counterparty exposure to stablecoin issuers and to dig a bit deeper what they are doing with the cash.

Licenses/regulation shouldn\u2019t kick in for just holding cash in interest-bearing accounts. But anything beyond that gets into the Investment Act of 1940\u2019s extra regulations. Can\u2019t recall, but that may be pushed back if you only hold federally backed securities. But yeah. Embezzlement risk is 100% the hardest thing to nail down. DAO gives 1% of the USDC to a CU. CU decides they\u2019re good and head to the Bahamas to live happily ever after. DAO isn\u2019t an entity so what\u2019s the recourse? I suspect there\u2019s a solution, but we\u2019re not there yet. Note that this problem is exactly why 6s has such a ridiculously complex proposed structure with about a dozen entities all told. ",

The structure there to ensure that we retain control of the collateral bonds seems to be the thing that we aren\u2019t able to apply to a plane Jane bank account?   Investing strategy is different from structure. There\u2019s lots of ways to deploy even 10% of what\u2019s in the PSM fairly quickly. The issue is who gets to sit on a pile of real world cash and be trusted not to end up on a private island in a hot tub surrounded by a bevy of beautiful men/women. Same problem if we custody the funds with an institution, as the DAO cannot sign a contract itself. That all likely involves a trust structure or some other entity that has ways to be forced to take instruction from the DAO. Remember, the DAO won\u2019t have any ownership rights. What would make this all a lot easier is if the Fed or Treasury or someone whom we already are critically exposed to if they fail would simply offer tokenized versions of their securities. Someday that\u2019s likely to come. Until then? We keep scratching our heads and trying to figure it out. ",

The DAO needs to make sure they are well capitalized and will \u201cbe around\u201d. The net margin is tough. While UST (or similar and set aside the tax implications for a moment) represent great collateral (if not ideal), the challenge is having a structure that has the custody and having a party that will run it with minimal margin. On the opposite side, if we have LendCOs that have excessively high-net margins, this points to the LendCO taking way more risk than the DAO should probably embrace (unless it is also pricing for that risk). A gross example would be sub-prime used car lending (great margin but material default rates). Finding the sweet spot in the middle is name of the game. ",
