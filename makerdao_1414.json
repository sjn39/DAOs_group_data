                    "content": " Introduction Welcome to the fifth edition of the Off-Chain Proposal Bounties Round-Up. This summary aims to introduce the successful governance authors and initiatives during the month of October. It also serves as an overview where members of the Maker Community can follow up on the new governance proposals submitted throughout the month. The Off-Chain Proposal Bounties Initiative aims to incentivize concrete and outcome-producing governance proposals by distributing a monthly pool of rewards among the authors of all Signal Requests, MIPs, and Subproposals favorably voted by Maker Governance. In this way, GovAlpha continues to search for alternative mechanisms to strengthen our governance process through the direct incentive of concrete governance actions, encouraging community members to trigger governance processes with tangible results.  Announcements Starting this month, GovAlpha will only reward the authoring of new Signal Requests that comply with the recently ratified MIP4c2-SP27: MIP Amendment Subproposal, which states that to protect the integrity of existing MIPs, Signals are only allowed if they are explicitly triggered and required by an existing MIP. This component explicitly prohibits the possibility of community-triggered Signals on any topic. It also explicitly states that the only way to make arbitrary changes to Maker Governance is through the full MIP process or Governance Mandates from Mandated Actors. However, we will maintain bounties for all existing pre MIP4c2-SP27: MIP Amendment Subproposal ratification Signals that have been positively voted by the community. If there is anything else you would like to see added, please send me a message or leave a comment below.  The Bounty The bounty consists of a pool of 6,000 DAI per month to be distributed among all successful MakerDAO governance proposals.  Eligible Proposal Types Proposals eligible for rewards are:  Successful MIP proposals Successful MIP Subproposals Successful Signal Requests  A proposal is considered successful if its on-chain vote meets the success criteria defined in the accompanying on-chain poll text.  Rewards The maximum reward for each type of successful proposal is denoted below.  MIP - 2,000 DAI Subproposal - 1,000 DAI Signal - 500 DAI  The reward pool for a given month is split between proposals according to the following weights.  MIP = 1 Subproposal = 1/2 Signal = \u00bc   Exclusions Proposals concerning collateral onboarding are not eligible for off-chain proposal bounties. Proposals requesting funds from the Maker Protocol are not eligible for off-chain proposal bounties. Core Unit members are not eligible to receive off-chain proposal bounties. This includes Core Unit Facilitators.  Eligible Successful Proposals in October This month we have two different eligible successful proposals. On this occasion, two new sub-proposals within the MIP41: Facilitator Framework challenge and transform different aspects of the DAO\u2019s interaction with its decentralized workforce. @Codeknight proposed MIP4c2-SP26: Facilitator Offboarding Process (MIP41c5) adjustments with the objective of streamlining the exit process for Facilitators offboarded by governance. After a month of RFC discussion, the proposal entered the October Governance Cycle and was approved with 58.39% positive votes backed by 46,107 MKR. On the other hand, @ultraschuppi was the author of the subproposal MIP41c5-SP12: Facilitator Offboarding (RWF-001). In order to ensure that the protocol meets its obligations to external stakeholders, it proposed that the RWF-001 Facilitator be relieved of his duties as a mandated actor and head of the RWF-001 Core Unit. The proposal entered the October Governance Cycle and was approved with 96.07% positive votes backed by 75,891 MKR Both subproposals have been rewarded with a bounty of 1000 DAI each. Finally, Rune has elected to waive the bounty for the Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set and Core Unit offboarding proposals.

October Stats  Polls & Executives In October, twenty-one Governance Polls and four Executive Votes were published to the voting portal.

This summary aims to introduce the successful governance authors and initiatives during the month of July. It also serves as an overview where members of the Maker Community can follow up on the new governance proposals submitted throughout the month. The Off-Chain Proposal Bounties Initiative aims to incentivize concrete and outcome-producing governance proposals by distributing a monthly pool of rewards among the authors of all Signal Requests, MIPs, and Subproposals favorably voted by Maker Governance. In this way, GovAlpha continues to search for alternative mechanisms to strengthen our governance process through the direct incentive of concrete governance actions, encouraging community members to trigger governance processes with tangible results. If there is anything else you would like to see added, please send me a message or leave a comment below.  The Bounty The bounty consists of a pool of 6,000 DAI per month to be distributed among all successful MakerDAO governance proposals.  Eligible Proposal Types Proposals eligible for rewards are:  Successful MIP proposals Successful MIP Subproposals Successful Signal Requests  A proposal is considered successful if its on-chain vote meets the success criteria defined in the accompanying on-chain poll text.  Rewards The maximum reward for each type of successful proposal is denoted below.  MIP - 2,000 DAI Subproposal - 1,000 DAI Signal - 500 DAI  The reward pool for a given month is split between proposals according to the following weights.  MIP = 1 Subproposal = 1/2 Signal = \u00bc   Exclusions Proposals concerning collateral onboarding are not eligible for off-chain proposal bounties. Proposals requesting funds from the Maker Protocol are not eligible for off-chain proposal bounties. Core Unit members are not eligible to receive off-chain proposal bounties. This includes Core Unit Facilitators.  Eligible Successful Proposals in July This month we had no eligible successful proposals.  July Stats  Polls & Executives In July, seven Governance Polls and three Executive Votes were published to the voting portal.   Governance Proposals Four Signal Requests were put to a vote whereas only one Subproposals have passed the formal submission window and have entered the Governance Cycle as a ratification poll.   July Successful Governance Proposals The following proposals were favorably voted during last month. None of these proposals were eligible as they were either made by a CU member, or regard requesting funds from the Maker Protocol, both of which are exclusion criteria.  Signals     Type Proposal Author     Signal Request  [SIGNAL REQUEST] [BEAR] Building Financial Resilience & DAO Targets @adcv     MIPs & Subproposals     Type Proposal Author     Subproposal MIP41c4-SP37: Governance Facilitator Onboarding (GOV-001) @Patrick_J     July Eligible Governance Proposals This month, two eligible Signals were put to the vote. One of them was unsuccessful, although the other is still in the running. We will follow its performance and see how this proposal evolves within the August Governance Cycle.  If you want to track the course of eligible proposals, you can do so through the Proposal Bounties Tracker. ",
