                    "content": "Hello UNIswapers! TLDR: How can the fee switch change the value proposition of $UNI? The rationale of owning ETH as an investment is that Ethereum is a clear market leader in the cryptocurrency space. The Ethereum network proves its value in strong development activity, smart contract functionality, and tangible fee generation (e.g., PoW mining, and fee burning). However, over the history of Ethereum (~9 years), none of the platform accrued compoundable value to ETH token holders.  In the summer of 2022, the Ethereum network is switching to a Proof-of-Stake consensus, securing its own network while rewarding stakers in the process. Why can\u2019t Uniswap do something as great? The fee switch mechanism developed within Uniswap\u2019s V2 & V3 contracts presents the opportunity to add compoundable value to UNI holders similar to how Ethereum plans to accrue compoundable value for staked ETH holders. Let\u2019s finally get something done. From endless twitter posts, discord rants, posts scattered throughout the governance forums, and month\u2019s long silence on the topic of the fee switch. Over the last 2 years, the Uniswap governance has been in indecision to \u201ctoggle\u201d the fee switch mechanism - stalled by inaction to help benefit $UNI holders who believe in the value of the Uniswap protocol. Through this proposal, we plan to create a responsible entity on changing the paradigm of $UNI being represented as purely a redundant \u201cgovernance-based\u201d token. By diverting a portion of swap fees from liquidity providers to $UNI holders, we shift the paradigm of holding a token to one where voting actually matters since $UNI can be used as a staking token for revenue generation and voters in tandem. Background on action. In a non-exhaustive list of actions, we propose to allocate the \u201cUltrasound UNI Fund\u201d with 0.3 \u2013 1 M $UNI with the directive to transform $UNI and establish: I.\tValue to UNI holders and prospective UNI investors: Ensuring the prosperity of $UNI holders by establishing the fraction of swap fees to be diverted from Uniswap\u2019s V3 contract from the Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism network to staked $UNI holders. This includes determining if the 5-basis point fee switch on Uniswap V2 should be enabled. II.\tDominance over competing DeX AMMs: Growing Uniswap\u2019s market share and being the best place to trade across many pairs is important. The fund aims to finance research on the optimal application of the fee switch mechanism by collaborating with knowledgeable professionals to carefully balance the impact to Liquidity Providers on a DeX competitiveness-based perspective. III.\tConservativeness to Uniswap LPs: Activating the fee switch on certain pools may disincentivize LPs from trading on Uniswap. The fund aims to establish an organization to communicate with Uniswap LPs on either activating the fee switch on a per-pool basis; or activating the fee switch on a protocol wide basis. IV.\tDefense against legal pressures: The fee switch may expose angles of undefined regulatory risk. The fund aims to consult with knowledgeable legal professionals on threats that may expose the Uniswap protocol to overarching agencies. V.\tActioning the Uniswap community: Incentivizing, proposing, creating, and following through the necessary governance processes to toggle the fee switch requires governance approval. The fund aims to commission research to investigate the scale of economic impact to $UNI holders and to maximize the potential earnings through the fee switch mechanism. Concluding Thoughts. We believe that activating the fee switch mechanism will add indisputable value to $UNI token holders and bring in a new perspective to future UNI investors. The change presents few, but meritable risk-factors to justify the creation of a fee-switch fund to manage the execution of this proposal. The suggested fund proposal size of 0.3 \u2013 1 M $UNI is purely speculation based on the expenses required to perform initial research, manage future governance changes, execute essential governance proposals, onboard DeX on-chain analysts, consultation fees, and collaborate with the community at large. A breakdown and distribution of the fees to fund the fee switch toggle are to be detailed in a consensus check. The snapshot voting poll will be live for 8 days, from Sunday, February 13 to Monday, February 21 (1:00PM). If the poll passes, a breakdown and distribution of the fees to fund the fee switch toggle are to be detailed in the consensus check phase. A link to the snapshot proposal: Snapshot ",

However, as we progressed with investigating the high-level complexities of enabling the fee switch, we came to the conclusion that UGP would not be the ideal place to start. In the effort of transparency, we wanted to start off with the community to judge on the formation of a fund on spearheading action toward enabling the fee switch. We also wanted to encourage public discourse on optimally applying the fee switch, and gather valuable insights on potential issues that may arise externally from interacting with Uniswap protocol\u2019s smart contracts. Finally, the UGP also has a loose association with Uniswap Labs, and as such, we believe that a governance submission is the only path forward. Please note the following text: \u201cUNI holders are responsible for ensuring that governance decisions are made in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. To help facilitate this, the fee switch has been initialized to a contract UNI holders can use to vote on tokens for which they will collect fees. The community is encouraged to consult knowledgeable legal and regulatory professionals before implementing any specific proposal.\u201d ref ",

By allocating the proposed funds, we want to achieve a level of rigor in covering all fronts of making the fee switch enablement a success to UNI holders. We appreciate any scrutinization toward the purposeful application of funds. If we reach a consensus check, further details on the proposed distribution will be made based on eliminating risk factors that enabling the fee switch may introduce. As a long-time Uniswap governance member and investor, I share the same frustration in recent developments regarding the controversy surrounding the unannounced sale of ~ $10M worth of UNI. We want to ensure that these funds are vested and used appropriately, or returned to the treasury in good faith. We also anticipate that with the objective of maximizing staked UNI APY that the public good of this proposal is a negligible cost to UNI holders. Regarding your question on the topic of team composition, we plan to onboard members as see fit and based on elements that require addressing before pushing a proposal on toggling the fee switch. We expect that USL is capable of creating the necessary contracts and UX/UI extensions to the app.uniswap.org website, however, the creation of a separate UI/UX entity can be funded through this proposal if required.

I believe that goal is more important than making the UNI token an income generating token to simply increase our profits. Turning the fee switch would make uniswap less competitive because of reduced LP profits (less TVL and more slippage). The question is, can the fees generated by the fee switch be directed towards the improvement of the Uniswap DEX in a way that would compensate for reduced LP profits? Simply directing the fee to UNI holders would initially make UNI more valuable, but with the drop in trading volume in Uniswap, the UNI value might drop too. Forcing LPs to buy UNI to get trading fees that they are not getting anymore doesn\u2019t seem logical to me because they could simply hold the assets and then buy UNI instead of LPing, especially if their fee income no longer covers impermanent loss. Your proposal already assumes that turning the fee switch is good for the protocol, but I think its more responsible to use part of that 0.3-1 million UNI to first conduct research to see if thats even the case. I\u2019m really interested in finding out whether turning the fee switch will be good for the protocol and I understand that currently the UNI token doesn\u2019t have many uses. Maybe trying to find new uses cases for it would be an alternative to turning the fee switch. If your research shows evidence that turning the fee switch will be good for the protocol then I would support it. ",

It would be reckless to blindly apply the fee switch throughout the V3 protocol without an economically justified basis of the fraction of swap fees collected from LPs.  It isn\u2019t entirely clear whether applying the fee switch is inherently \u201cgood\u201d for the protocol, and for that reason, the organization plans to fund such analysis to demonstrate the optimal fraction of swap fees collected as one part of a multi-action initiative. As you may already note, the fee switch can be applied on a per pool basis on V3, also, the fraction of swap fees collected can be adjusted based on a range set within Uniswap\u2019s V3 limit to ensure LPs are negligibly affected. Overall, we want to ensure a healthy balance between swap fees collected to avoid driving away liquidity on Uniswap. ",

The word \u201cwe\u201d is used, but I have no clarity on who is proposing, who is on the team and if they have the capability to follow through to the outline. I also find it problematic that the cost is very high (10 million USD) and the deliverables are unclear. You also are defaulting to Uniswap Labs building out UI/UX around the fee switch. If legal issues are a concern then this would not be possible. I would find more confidence if you had a team capable of executing considering the money being asked. My hope is the community can find a more direct and actionable route to the fee switch. For example a proposal that analyzes a pair that would be suitable for a V3 fee switch and does an individual proposal for that pair, which sets a framework for future fee switches. Similar to how the .01% basis fee pair was initialized. This proposal is too bureaucratic in nature and unclear to it\u2019s research expertise. Value for UNI is a must, but let\u2019s do it in a more streamlined way. ",

For all its worth, having received a grant should imply a better informed opinion. I am simply calling these programes what they are - a soft rug. They are inherently taking money out of the holder\u00b4s pocket and redistributing them elsewhere. This does not mean they have to be wound up, but Im not going to sit here and scream that they provide extreme value for the token holder when its simply not the case. UNI token is a wealth redistribution mechanism a.k.a a soft rug. It has no inherent value without the fee switch. The Harvard students havent logged in over 6 months. In one of their posts, they stated they would not dump the UNI day one \u201cbecause it would be problematic\u201d. Bam, day one. Half is gone. If you do not want to call that a soft rug, then I do not know what else you want to call it. Another example is the UGP sponsorship of Team Secret, what value do the token holders get by giving an esports team 250 000 USD in UNI?? How does it improve the value proposition of the Uniswap ecosystem or the value of the token besides B level marketing? Are we really saying that using 250k to pay for an AD is a good use of funds? Wouldnt it be better to allocate the 250k to other projects that are actually BUILDING stuff? I see it as imperative the UNI token holders have their own association sponsored by the UNI treasury to finally accrue value for the UNI holders. Its high time. If this is not done, the UNI token will remain a laughing stock. Im not one of those people that will bullshit you and tell you everything is all right and dandy if thats what you are looking for.

One other comment, just because Uniswap isn\u2019t actively paying out revenue to token holders doesn\u2019t mean that token holders aren\u2019t accruing value. UNI dex market share has been rising steadily, and many more users consider Uniswap to be synonymous with Ethereum DEX trading (brand value). We\u2019re also winning the war of attrition with other dex projects like Sushi, who are forced to pay out unsustainable incentives to maintain TVL just to remain competitive. Among all major dex protocols, Uniswap has by far the best profitability (including both revenues and cost of token incentives). ",

I\u2019d love to see how we can work together on funding a smaller research initiative on the topic of the fee switch. Please check your DMs! I am also drafting another temperature check to address your points noted. Though I do have a little trouble with your definition of token holders accruing \u201cvalue\u201d. It seems to me this is somewhat an inaccurate statement since the price of $UNI has fallen from one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies in market capitalization at its peak (excluding stablecoins), and is now down to the bottom 30. It\u2019s almost as if the bullish on-chain analytics of the Uniswap protocol appears to be inversely proportional with the collapsing price of $UNI. The fund aims to solve simple altruistic questions:  How much longer will this trend continue? Is there any rationale for investors or any large external VC funds, investors, or hedge funds to purchase $UNI based on this strong correlation? Can the community rapidly call for a singular entity to officiate innovative methods to help reverse this trend?  The fund also aims to maintain the value of $UNI and the level of participation in Uniswap governance:  If the price of $UNI continues to collapse, what risks are created to Uniswap\u2019s governance, Uniswap\u2019s protocol attractiveness, the reputation of Uniswap\u2019s brand value, and reputation to large token holders participation (i.e., VC funds alike a16z, Uniswap Labs, etc.)?

                    "content": "My name is Derek and I\u2019m an intern at Variant, a crypto-native token fund investing in the ownership economy. The fund is one of Uniswap\u2019s earliest investors. Variant Fund believes that flipping the Uniswap fee switch should be further researched, but in the short run, scale and user acquisition should be prioritized over protocol revenue. We support researching the Uniswap fee switch for the following reasons:  Even with the switch turned on, our hypothesis is that Uniswap could still offer the most competitive unincentived yields among leading DEXs. The additional protocol fees could be invested in ecosystem growth, treasury diversification, and other initiatives without placing selling pressure on the UNI token.  As the DEX space becomes increasingly competitive, protocol revenue could help Uniswap defend its leading position. Nevertheless, we believe there should be a more detailed use of funds before a grant of up to 1m UNI (~$10m) as stated in the Snapshot proposal is issued; a more suitable path might be requesting funds through the Uniswap Grants Program for this initial exploration. After a comprehensive use of funds is released, we support researching possible scenario models and timelines to switch on fees in the long run. We feel various conditions and assumptions should be further researched in order to move forward with the fee switch. These include the following, among others:   Low Impact on LPs - While Uniswap offers extremely competitive yields from trading volume alone, fee increases on other protocols could be used as benchmarks for sensitivity analysis to determine the switch\u2019s potential impact; we believe that fees should be switched on if most liquidity is expected to remain on the platform.  Market Leadership - Fees should not be switched on until Uniswap has a firm position as the leading DEX. Its network effects must create sufficient defensibility so it doesn\u2019t lose volume to other DEXs. (The switch would have no direct effects on the demand-side of the marketplace; this condition is mostly looking into indirect effects such as the possibility of weaker liquidity, fewer token options, etc).  Transparency - Although discussions around the fee switch have increased recently, we feel that the event should be made clear to LPs with forward guidance so there is not an emotional, short-term reaction that could impact liquidity.  We are supporters of a long-term approach to switching on fees for the two reasons stated above: Uniswap\u2019s competitive yields and additional growth capital. First, many in the community have expressed concerns that the fee switch could lead LPs to shift to other platforms. We believe that these concerns are over exaggerated and Uniswap will still offer one of the most competitive yield opportunities for LPs. Trading Volume / TVL is a ratio that represents yield potential; it is proportional to trading fees collected per every dollar of LP capital. Uniswap\u2019s Vol / TVL is tracking at ~3x Sushiswap\u2019s, ~5x Bancor\u2019s, and ~9x Balancer\u2019s; even with some IL, Uniswap clearly offers the most competitive passive, organic yields. These metrics largely come from Uniswap controlling ~75% of the DEX market. Uniswap can maintain this position through strong network effects; it is commonly the first dApp for new crypto users, which drives volume growth and new token listings, further attracting LPs. Importantly, even with the fee switch turned on and the parameter set to its maximum value (25% of total revenue), Uniswap will still offer the most competitive unincentivized yields: Average APR with Max Fee Switch: 1. Uniswap = 13.1% 2. Sushiswap = 7.5% 3. Bancor = 2.4% 4. Balancer* = 2.2% 5. Curve = 1.3% Notes: Average APR calculated by dividing annualized supply-side revenue by TVL (Source: Token Terminal) *Balancer is currently facing a vote to increase its protocol fees Second, new protocol fees could be used to ensure Uniswap maintains its position as a market leader. Below are example use cases for additional funds allocated to the treasury:   Community development - Additional reserves could be used to hire community managers and bolster the value of Uniswap\u2019s network through events, marketing, and Discord management.  Business Development - Many parts of the crypto industry are gradually being moved on-chain; additionally, adoption of DeFi is still relatively low (~4m / 75m Ethereum wallets). Protocol revenue could be used to pursue additional partnerships and possible integrations with off-chain applications without being forced to spend UNI tokens.  Treasury diversification - Uniswap has the largest treasury of any DAO; however, the protocol notably lacks any kind of treasury diversification as all reserves are held in UNI tokens. Additional revenue could be used to invest in stablecoins and blue chips without having to sell UNI and place downward pressure on the token\u2019s price.  Importantly, these uses of funds aim to generate additional volume for the protocol and support the UNI token; in other words, LPs could see their yields actually increase from additional top-line revenue. In the long-run, revenue could be redistributed to token holders as well, but the more pressing need for funds is protocol development. These initiatives could be funded through the Uniswap treasury in the short run, but continuously funding them with UNI would place selling pressure on the token; we believe initiatives like these should be explored further. The DEX space is becoming increasingly competitive; not only are peer AMMs launching additional features and upgrades, but alternative DEX models - notably orderbook-based - are also emerging quickly as alternatives to Uniswap. Protocol revenue should thus be considered a necessity to ensure Uniswap\u2019s long-term success, and we firmly believe more research is required. ",

As long as any person\u2019s opinion reaches a certain amount of support, it can be handed over to a professional team to promote the governance progress;   Increase the approval rate from the current 50% approval rate to more than 66% support rate.
