Core Unit Introduction  Maker Academy will strive to be the go-to source of education regarding MakerDAO. Learners of MakerDAO will no longer be presented with a conflicting, fragmented, and unorganized body of information. Maker Academy will become an essential part of onboarding by leveraging its future, active community of MakerDAO learners to create a pool of potential hires. We will also specialize in making onboarding content for each core unit. Maker Academy plans to both produce educational content and facilitate the production of it. We will guide creators in making exceptionally clear and concise content, accomplished by following the highest standards of communication and pedagogy. Maker Academy will encourage knowledge sharing amongst the core units in order to aggregate their documentation, new discoveries, and other relevant information in one easy to find place.   Facilitator Introduction  My name is Colby Anderson. I have a strong background in pedagogy/education, previous experience in project management, and an in-depth technical knowledge of computer science and finance that gives me the ability to create and curate the highest quality educational material about blockchains/DeFi. 4 years studying pedagogy/epistemology, 3 years studying computer science and blockchains, 2 years studying finance/DeFi, 2 years in project management, 0.5 years with MakerDAO Discord: colbyanderson#8887   What\u2019s Next?  Our first goal is to create the Maker Academy website that will host all of our educational material. We plan to already have a few pieces of content when we release our MVP. We will have a more official introduction of our core unit after the release of the MVP. If the MVP generates a positive response, we plan to move forward with our MIP submissions.   Call to Action  We need more contributors to accomplish our goals. We need a front end developer and a content producer. If you know of anyone, please contact me on discord. If you have any ideas regarding Maker Academy\u2026directions we could pursue, adding to our vision, suggesting more problems we can solve, best ways to produce content, basically any idea\u2026please comment on this post or reach out to me in discord! If you or someone you know is developing any educational material regarding MakerDAO or if you need material developed, please reach out to me in discord!

Determining success factors in education can be tricky. I\u2019ve looked at your proposed success metrics. \" Success of the platform will be measured through analytics. Specifically, the number of learners, the number of experts, the amount of content consumed, and the amount of content produced.\" I think \u201c\u2026the amount of content consumed, and the amount of content produced\u2026\u201d puts a bit too much weight on quantity rather than the objective of having the courses. To put in other terms, these metrics incentivises many low effort courses rather than fewer higher quality courses. The main goal is to educate. The traditional form of measuring success is through passed qualifications. An alternative would be to measure the percentage of completed courses measured against the numbers of contributors who should have them. Such a metric might also reveal content that is less used and in need of replacement. Of course such a metric is not mutually exclusive with the ones proposed so there might be room for both. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the reply! My vision for Maker Academy\u2019s platform is much different than the Maker Operation Manual. Note, I am making the distinction between Maker Academy and Maker Academy\u2019s platform. I see Maker Academy having a bigger role than just it\u2019s educational website. In the future, we have many more plans, such as podcasts, working with other affiliated organizations in an educational capacity, and even making a documentary.   Pedagogical approach. I think documentation and manuals are for those who already understand the principles behind the documentation/manuals (in most cases). For example, if I\u2019m going to read documentation of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, it will do me little good if I don\u2019t already know a) how to code b) cryptography c) distributed systems d) basic computer science. However, trying to learn principles and concepts can be quite hard when reading documentation/manuals; they have no pedagogical standards\u2026or extremely low ones at that. Maker Academy will produce content that will have pedagogical standards to address this gap in learning within the MakerDAO ecosystem. It will be similar to Khan Academy in that way.    Organization. I think the hierarchical structure of the Manual (how it separates topics and subtopics), or lack of hierarchical structure, is quite bad. However, the creators of this hierarchical structure may have been limited by the site\u2019s UI. Imagine if content could be sorted by field i.e. Finance, Law, Business, etc., and further separated by subfield (for finance) i.e. Securities, Markets, Accounting, etc. Or they could filter content by each core unit\u2019s domain. As illustrated, there are many ways to provide a structure to MakerDAO\u2019s educational content, none of which the Manual does well (in my opinion).   User Friendliness. Personally, I would say most newcomers to MakerDAO would not know where to begin studying, let alone study what they specifically want to learn. Although there is some content on the site, most material simply links to other sites. It can be quite confusing to navigate.   Breadth. Although the Manual goes over many topics, Maker Academy plans to give in-depth education on all topics in MakerDAO, covering all the work from each core unit.   Decentralized. We plan to have an extremely user-friendly option for the community to create their own content as well. This content will then be reviewed and revised by Maker Academy before officially being posted to our site.   Specialization. We plan to design content for specific audiences. For example, some of our content will be meant for \u201cnewbies\u201d, others meant for new-hires, others meant for researches, etc.   Much More. I have a very clear version of the Maker Academy\u2019s platform. I see it extremely different than the Maker Operational Manual. I imagine the platform as a combination of Khan Academy, YouTube, and Binance Academy. The differences I listed in this reply are only just what came to me first; there are many more.   Ultimately, there needs to be a team behind education in the DAO; a group of people who can continuously address the educational needs of the community. Let me know if you have any other questions!

Measuring success in education is always tricky, especially when you know most people won\u2019t voluntarily take tests or do projects (something we plan to incentive through our future certification program and contribution projects program). \u201c\u2026the amount of content consumed, and the amount of content produced \u2026\u201d I agree that the amount of content produced measures quantity, not quality. However, amount of content consumed on a grand scale does reflect how much traffic we attract (and continue to attract). Also, how much a particular piece of content is consumed can be a slight indicator into quality, when compared among other pieces of content. \u201cAn alternative would be to measure the percentage of completed courses measured against the numbers of contributors who should have them\u201d I\u2019m not quite clear on what you mean. I\u2019m assuming you to mean identifying the education needs of specific users of our platform, mapping these needs to courses, and then determining whether they have completed these courses. If this is the case, it will be hard to identify the education needs of all users in an automatic way. We plan to do a version of this in the future by having users be attributed certain roles (Ex: Growth Core Unit Team Member) and by having users fill out questionnaires and optional placement tests. But all in all, many kinds of metrics will be readily available, as explained below. A Note on Success Metrics   Analytics Engine. As mentioned, success can be hard to measure and predict. Maker Academy\u2019s platform plans to keep track of and store all kinds of different metrics. Some of these metrics may not be used in any kind of success measurement, but they could be in the future.   Certification Program. In the future, Maker Academy plans to offer multiple kinds of certifications. The goal would be that these certifications would be necessary to obtain during the onboarding process or before. If Maker Academy gets enough name recognition on its own, they might be popular certifications in it of themselves. These certifications would involve tests and other requirements. Besides the benefit of \u201cvetting\u201d people\u2019s knowledge, this program gives a side benefit of incentivizing users to take tests, which could be another metric of how well our educational material is.   Contribution Projects. Contribution projects would be any kind of work that would help MakerDAO. Work could be anything from researching a specific topic, to adding analytics software for Maker protocol, etc. Essentially, the work would be anything a core unit would want to allocate to someone else. It is undecided what kind of incentives would be in place for these projects. It may end up being some DAI incentive or maybe they are a requirement to certain certifications. Either way, these projects would be another way of measuring success of our educational material.   ",

I think the academy\u2019s vision is quite significant and important, but I think the focus on yet another website (platform) instead of exploring unification might be jumping the gun. I left a lot of comments on your docs, forgive me.   If the academy slightly adjusted its vision to focus on liaising the cohesive presence we have into one whole that would be the highest value short term.  Then the academy\u2019s platform can emerge more organically around the needs the DAO has and where it meets it\u2019s learners. So the biggest callout I have, and it\u2019s not just the academy it\u2019s all of Maker, is best summarized on XKCD. I think focusing on \u201ceveryone makes their own explainer\u201d is starting to do two harmful things (unintentionally)  many teams feel like they can describe Maker better than anyone else  all these sites fracture our SEO presence.  I won\u2019t bore anyone with the details but SEO is one of three levers any tech platform has to grow (organic, referral, and SEO). We keep spinning up websites yet never asking, why? Or talking to users to actually achieve the goals we set out for. In addition, by coordinating a regular meeting cadence with the extended Maker community then sourcing and guiding people through your learning paths, we might end up with a faster-growing presence than we know what to do with (with iterations along the way of course, as per SES continuous learning model) . I guess I\u2019m saying dream bigger, don\u2019t limit the vision to one site, unite them all into a cohesive audience-based approach. Then cultivate the uninitiated as best you can, if it needs another site sure, but my guess is we need more cohesion.

                    "content": "Thank you for giving such an in-depth reply. I really appreciate your advice. And, thank you for taking the time to comment on the MSV!     twblack88:  focus on yet another website (platform) instead of exploring unification   I do not see a dichotomy between focusing on a website and focusing on unification. I see creating the website as a means to unification. For example, the Maker Operation Manual was an attempt to unify educational material through a website.     twblack88:  If the academy slightly adjusted its vision to focus on liaising the cohesive presence we have into one whole that would be the highest value short term.   I think we have a disagreement of classification here and not principles. What, you consider vision, I consider strategy. The essence of the Academy\u2019s vision is to be the go-to source of education for MakerDAO. The essence of the Academy\u2019s strategy is to utilize experts (such as other core units and outside parties) to create content that the Academy revises. This means that our strategy would involve reaching out to other core units and developing material with them, in addition to revising old material, in order to have it all in one place. In my understanding, this description of strategy is synonymous with \u201cliaising the cohesive presence we have into one whole\u201d, but let me know if you disagree.     twblack88:  many teams feel like they can describe Maker better than anyone else   The Academy will not be the sole creator of content. The Academy plans to utilize the expertise of other teams to develop content in their own specific areas. Ultimately, the Academy does not plan on describing Maker better than everyone else on our own, we plan to leverage the entire community to help do this.     twblack88:  all these sites fracture our SEO presence.   I completely agree. To have better SEO, one site needs to stand out. No current MakerDAO educational site has a whole team behind it, constantly improving and maintaining it\u2026especially to the standards that the Academy wants. In other words, the Academy plans to be that one site to increase SEO.     twblack88:  by coordinating a regular meeting cadence with the extended Maker community then sourcing and guiding people through your learning paths, we might end up with a faster-growing presence than we know what to do with   I am not quite sure if I am understanding you correctly here. Our site would be able to handle as many learners as possible. And, if they all end up taking learning paths specialized towards getting a job in MakerDAO, that just means a better candidate pool.     twblack88:  I guess I\u2019m saying dream bigger, don\u2019t limit the vision to one site, unite them all into a cohesive audience-based approach.   Our dreams for the Academy are very big. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t make much sense to include long-term ideas that won\u2019t even be worked on for just yet. So in our MSV (the strategy section), we just focused on onboarding and our site. In the long-term, we plan to make a large-scale documentary, have a podcast, and many other things.     twblack88:  Also have thoughts on this that might be helpful, either from on-chain certificates via attestation to NFTs.   This is a great idea!!! \u201clots of opportunities to work cross functionally, especially with gov comms internally liaising.\u201d Also, this is a comment you made in our MSV doc. Just wanted to mention that we are doing this. There will be a GovComms internal coordination meeting on the education/onboarding initiative where SES, Talent, and Academy (maybe a few others, I forget) are meeting. ",

I have a suggestion here for incentivizing learners and beginner audiences. I recommend allocating some budget towards collaborating with projects such as rabbithole.gg or layer3.xyz. These are up-and-coming gamified education protocols in the Web3 space used by similar DAOs such as Aave and Compound. These align directly with this objective because we can reward new users with some DAI to use the Maker protocol or complete the Maker Academy. The gamified nature should also make it relatively simple to track participation and success. Another benefit is increased awareness. For example, Rabbithole has a podcast that we could use for cross-marketing through mutual appearances if we were to have our podcast as you outlined in the Google Doc. I believe that easy and rewarding educational journeys with highly-visible partners such as these can be a massive win for Maker. ",
