I would have posted this on Updates but dont have permission there.  And regulatory risk is certainly risk. SEC\u2019s Gensler Doesn\u2019t See Cryptocurrencies Lasting Long Regulator says history of \u2018wildcat banking\u2019 in U.S. shows limited viability for private forms of money SEC Chair Gary Gensler likened the thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence to the so-called wildcat banking era that took hold in the U.S. from 1837 until 1863. By Paul Kiernan Updated Sept. 21, 2021 4:20 pm ET WASHINGTON\u2014Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said Tuesday he doesn\u2019t see much long-term viability for cryptocurrencies, underscoring the importance of protecting investors in the market and bringing it under regulatory oversight. Mr. Gensler likened the thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence to the so-called wildcat banking era that took hold in the U.S. from 1837 until 1863 in the absence of federal bank regulation. Before President Abraham Lincoln created the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, banks issued their own currencies, which they sometimes refused to redeem for their purported value in gold or silver. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s long-term viability for five or six thousand private forms of money,\u201d Mr. Gensler said in a virtual event hosted by the Washington Post. \u201cSo in the meantime I think it\u2019s worthwhile to have an investor-protection regime placed around this.\u201d Mr. Gensler, who took office in April, previously taught a class on cryptocurrency at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, raising hopes among some industry participants that he would be a friendly regulator. Instead, he has repeatedly likened the crypto market to the Wild West and urged crypto trading and lending platforms to register with the SEC, saying they are likely offering unregistered securities in violation of federal law. A pre-markets primer packed with news, trends and ideas. Plus, up-to-the-minute market data. On Tuesday he took aim at stablecoins, a fast-growing segment of the crypto market that has attracted increased scrutiny from regulators in recent months. These tokens\u2014including Tether, USD Coin and Binance USD\u2014are pegged at a one-to-one ratio to the dollar and say they are backed by high-quality assets. They are used primarily to trade other cryptocurrencies. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of casinos here in the Wild West, and the poker chip is these stablecoins at the casino gaming tables,\u201d Mr. Gensler said. He said stablecoins often have aspects of both SEC-regulated investment contracts and banking products but that federal bank regulators don\u2019t have all the authorities they need to supervise them. In separate remarks Tuesday, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu said Tuesday the crypto industry is on a path that resembles that of credit derivatives ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. He expressed doubt that cryptocurrency is achieving its goal of promoting financial inclusion and criticized crypto instruments that promise steady yields to investors for failing to explain how those returns are generated. \u201cI have seen one fool\u2019s gold rush from up close in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d Mr. Hsu said in remarks to the Blockchain Association, a crypto lobbying group. \u201cIt feels like we may be on the cusp of another with cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance.\u201d ",

At this point, I\u2019m pretty hesitant to draw attention to ourselves without someone else in the room. I did ask Warren\u2019s office if they would be open to facilitating a discussion (aka tell SEC to talk to us), and they were not interested. The SEC\u2019s inability to make sweeping changes makes me thing for now it is best to cool our heels until we have a plan. Not a lawyer, but as we offer no yield-bearing products (except DSR, which is for the most part mothballed) and do not hold deposits of consumers, I do think we are likely to be very far back on their list of actors they want to look at. I am also not especially worried about DAI, but very worried about MKR in their eyes, and am really eager to not issue new MKR.     Eumenes:  By Paul Kiernan   I just realized I know this person. Went to college with him and worked at a newspaper together. Small world. Will reach out.     Planet_X:  There are numerous references by Gensler to words as casinos, wild west, poker, and private currencies all intended to be associated with gaming, randomness, and periods of US history with far fewer rules compared to the present age.   Our biggest critics use this a lot, and it is quite honestly a fair characterization of many corners of crypto. This is where Maker is unique amongst crypto, in that with enough time, our RWA program can provide a strong rebuke to this. We shouldn\u2019t just accept any deal that comes to us, but especially easy-to-relate things like a solar farm or 6S financing commercial real estate are very tangible examples of crypto finance being used for \u201creal\u201d purposes. Whenever any of us talk to people outside ",
