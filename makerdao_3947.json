                    "content": "Hey MakerDAO Community! My name is Michael Mtenga. I am a core contributor at Index Coop. This post serves to formally introduce myself to the Maker DAO community. I have volunteered to be the protocol ambassador for Maker DAO. What that means is I will provide updates to Index Coop regarding matters relating to Maker DAO and the Maker protocol. Index Coop is a DAO with the vision of making DeFi more accessible. We realize this vision through our products like the DeFi Pulse Index (DPI), Metaverse Index (MVI) and Flexible leverage Indexes (ETH2xFLI & BTC2xFLI). In addition to this, we have many more products in the pipeline that we believe will showcase the value propositions of Decentralized Finance. As of this post, we have 6 338 MKR in the DPI contract and part of our mission of Index Coop is to actively participate in the governance of the protocol included in our Index tokens. This is the level of involvement you can expect from me:  Attending community related calls for updates Activily interacting with forum posts related to Index Coop products  Here is a brief list of goals I would like to achieve as protocol ambassador:  Enable MKR tokens held in the DPI contract to participate in Maker DAO governance Assist with the on-boarding of DPI and future Index Coop products as collateral on Maker.  Additionally, I will explore opportunities to actively contribute to the community. That will be based on whether I can add value sustainably without compromising my level of involvement at Index Coop. Personally, I am a huge supporter of Maker. The work the protocol has done in the eco-system has really contributed to the growth of DeFi and if it wasn\u2019t for Maker Protocol a lot of the protocols in the eco-system wouldn\u2019t be where they are today. Looking forward to seeing more innovations from the community. If there are any questions please feel free to ask in the comments. I am also available on discord: Mringz | Index#7743. If there is any core contributor who would like to set up a call to help me get more accustomed with the community, I would really appreciate it. ",
