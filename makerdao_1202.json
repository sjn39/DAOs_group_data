                    "content": " Missed Proposal Post-Mortem This post is to document a mistake from GovAlpha for transparency as well as address methods for preventing a similar error in the future.  Executive Summary  A clerical error led to this proposal being archived and marked as accepted on the forum, despite it never going up for a vote. The error was a result of the new proposal having the same title as a MIP that had passed governance right before the new proposal was posted. The error was uncovered when @hexonaut pinged @prose11 to ask when the funding stream for Keep3r would be set up. To rectify the situation, MIP63c4-SP4 will be included with next week\u2019s ratification polls. GovAlpha believes the resulting 3 weeks before the end of the vote on the matter should give time for the community to review and engage with the proposal, while not adding even more downtime before it is processed. These decisions ultimately result in the proposal going up for vote one month later than it otherwise should have, with far less visibility during the RFC period due to being removed from the RFC category and subsequent announcements about proposals in RFC.   What happened? The origin of the error is MIP63c4-SP4: Onboard/Amend Keeper Network - Keep3r Network being archived and marked accepted on the Maker Forum (April 4, 2022). This follows MIP63c4-SP2: Onboard/Amend Keeper Network - Keep3r Network being approved by MKR holders on March 28, 2022. The approved proposal was to set up Keep3r as a Keeper Network, noting that a funding request would occur at a later date, MIP63c4-SP4: Onboard/Amend Keeper Network - Keep3r Network was posted on March 30, 2022, to request that funding. Because the post was archived so quickly after being made, it was not included on any checklists for proposals in RFC. Additionally, a PR to the MIPs repo was never made, as this is often handled by GovAlpha after a proposal is posted to the forum. Two subsequent comments toward the end of April on the thread went unnoticed by GovAlpha. The scope of the error did not become apparent until June 6, 2022, when @hexonaut inquired about the state of the funding stream, on behalf of the Keep3r Network. At which point the origin of the oversight was quickly deduced and a plan for rectifying the situation formed.  Why did this error occur? When analyzing any significant error, I believe Dr. Reason\u2019s Swiss Cheese Model (otherwise known as cumulative act effect) to be critical in understanding what went wrong. Rarely are serious incidents caused by a single point of failure, and it\u2019s important to realize that in this case the archiving of the subproposal was just the first \u201chole\u201d in a string of missed opportunities for correction. GovAlpha takes full responsibility for this error and the undeserved delay in getting this proposal before Governance. The following contributing factors were ultimately up to GovAlpha to rectify if we want to foster an open, decentralized governance process.  Contributing factors  Duplication of the title of the subproposal. Not having the luxury of an active contributor being the proposal author. Incomplete checklist for processing ratification poll results. Amount of threads/comments being posted to the Maker Forum. Expanding internal GovAlpha responsibilities without subsequent increases in the labor pool.   Causation Analysis While the reason for the initial error was very apparent only a few minutes after looking into this issue, why the issue was not caught before today was a bit more puzzling. There were several moments where the mistake could have been realized and acted upon, but the contributing factors listed above all compounded the mistake. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say the first error occurred the day MIP63c4-SP4 was posted. When new items are added to the MIPs category, GovAlpha should first look for any duplication of titles so they can be amended. Not only will this step prevent future errors by GovAlpha, but it will also apply additional clarity to the Maker community when considering and debating new proposals. The next cumulative miss came with the lack of a specified checklist for processing proposals after a vote. In the past, this was a single item on a larger checklist for a MIP cycle due to the small number of proposals that need to be processed month to month. However, this is exactly where a checklist shines most - when reviewing small, repeated actions that are simple to verify but potentially disastrous when missed. The next mistake from GovAlpha was our tacit assumption that most MIP authors are active members of the community. We have made errors of omission in the past, and they are pretty immediately recognized by their stakeholders who are upset at the perceived snub of not being included. However, there is no requirement that MIP authors visit the forum daily, or attend the weekly G&R calls where MIPs in RFC are read off to the community. We now realize that because anyone can make a proposal (and we encourage any interested party to do so!) we cannot lean on the community\u2019s involvement to back up our maintenance. Finally, this omission was not captured by our Govenance Tracker because it is manually updated based on proposals in specific forum categories. This left us vulnerable to miscategorized (or in this case, misallocated) posts not being picked up during our periodic updates. With so much forum activity, this \u201cshortcut\u201d was relied on as there are plenty of moderators to move posts to their correct category. Yet we had no protection for a permissioned member inadvertently moving a post to the wrong category.  What now? MIP63c4-SP4 will be added to the ratification polls going up for a vote one week from today (on June 13, 2022). With 3 weeks until voting will conclude, this should still give the Maker Community plenty of time to come to an informed decision on the proposal. Likewise, though this proposal was delayed one month past when it should have been voted on, including the proposal immediately should limit the impact of the delay. We have already tagged the Recognized Delegates in the original thread and used an @community tag in our discord to draw attention to the post. On GovAlpha\u2019s end, we will be adding checklists for processing out MIPs, mainly concerning the posting of new threads in the MIPs category and processing the results of ratification polls. Likewise, we will be looking into automation options for capturing new threads in our MIPs tracker, to give one more spot where potential oversights can be noticed.  Call for feedback This Post-Mortem was produced today to catalog our mistakes and prevent them from happening in the future. It is inevitable mistakes will be made, but by producing reports like this we can seek to limit their effect and catch them sooner. We request feedback on both this analysis and how we handled this situation. If you have solutions that can help GovAlpha avoid mistakes in the future don\u2019t be afraid to reach out. ",
