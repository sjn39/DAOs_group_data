What would be the best approach to deal with the generation and storage of this measure? Who are the users of a supply measurement? Are there different kinds of supply which would be useful or relevant?   A response by J\u039eFF to \u201cCrypto\u2019s Weirdest Cognitive Dissonance\u201d on Twitter https://twitter.com/jeffehh/status/1294289745292546049:  It\u2019s not as dry cut as it may seem. BTC for example allow for a simple algorithm to calculate the current amount of coins. For ethereum it\u2019s slightly different because it allows for ether to be burned (as in it doesn\u2019t exists anymore). Without iterating over all of the accounts in the trie you\u2019ll never have a definitive answer. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible, but it would take an insane amount of time. The other solution is to create a separate log that records changes to the total supply (I.e. block rewards, suicide calls + pre-minted coins). Bear in mind that this will only ever be possible when running a full node (I.e. start execution from genesis) and I have no idea what kind of overhead this may cause plus it\u2019s slightly tricky because you\u2019d need to record only SUICIDE ADDRESS and SUICIDE <the address of the to be suicided contract>. Also I wouldn\u2019t want to mess with the VM unless absolutely necessary and certainly not, imo, for a nice gimmick.  ",
