Join us on March 4th in Paris, one day before EthCC. This new gathering coincides with the one-year anniversary from the first gathering which happened during last year\u2019s EthCC.  Registration Registration is now open. The capacity is 200 attendees, so if you are coming, please reserve your spot in time. Early registering also helps us prepare for the event in a more detailed and paced way, please help us achieve a great edition. As discussed here, there is a 30\u20ac participation charge, covering the cost of each participant\u2019s meals. We have set up the payments in ETH (currently each ticket is manually issued by volunteers after the payment goes through, so please allow some time for us to work ). In case this price is too high for you, let us know and we will find a way to subsidize your attendance. For subsidies, just fill in your details in registration form and instead of making the transaction, send us an email to: councilofparis2019 (at) ethereumevents.global  Sponsors The Council is organized with the invaluable local help from Asseth and @jdetychey, who are managing the venue and catering, while video streaming/recording will be covered, once again, by Fluence team. Shoutout also to Ethereum Community Fund, whose ongoing grant helps us continue sustainably. We are constantly looking for more sponsors, so if you are interested in helping, fill in your details here or send a PM to @ethernian.  Agenda The Magicians council format is something that we have been working on for a long time, and we hope you can familiarize with the open discussion format beforehand. The final schedule is not set, we look forward for your input. You can do that:  in this forum or in the registration page.  For any questions, you can PM @mariapaulafn or open a separate topic (as with anything here). An official agenda will be released before the event.  Volunteers We conduct weekly volunteer calls \u2013 if you want to get involved please leave a comment below or PM me and we\u2019ll make sure you get a call invite.
