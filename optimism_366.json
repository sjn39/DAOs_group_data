One voting badge will be given to 10 Token House delegates. The post below outlines what this means for Token House delegates. From December 8th - December 14th:  Each delegate with greater than >0.5% voting power may nominate 2 Token House delegates to be badgeholders for rPGF 2. Each of the 10 elected Token House delegates will be able to distribute an additional badge to an individual of their choosing If you have >0.5% votable supply and would like to nominate a delegate, please complete the template below and post to this forum thread by December 14th at 7pm GMT There is no voting power requirement for nominees, but nominees must have posted a delegate commitment by 12/5/2022. Delegates may not nominate themselves Please note that holding a voting badge for one round does not guarantee voting rights in subsequent rounds; Citizenship criteria are subject to change going forward If an elected Token House delegate is or becomes ineligible to receive a badge (ie. if they will receive a badge based on other criteria or become a member of the Optimism team), the elected badgeholder will select a replacement to receive their badge instead.  From December 15th - December 21st:  The Token House will vote to select 10 badgeholders from the full list of nominees. This vote will occur via approval voting on Snapshot. Voting is set up such that you can place a vote for any number of nominees. The 10 nominees with the most votes will receive voting badges for rPGF2. This is approval voting, not ranked choice, meaning each selected choice will receive equal voting power.  From January 3rd - Jan 17th:  Anyone can nominate a project or person for funding in rPGF 2, following the process outlined here   From January 31st - February 10th:  Token House delegate badgeholders will vote on which projects receive rPGF in round 2   Token House Badgeholder Nomination Template  Nominating delegate: Link to delegate commitment: Link to verify delegation of >0.5% of the votable supply: Name of delegate you\u2019d like to nominate: Link to nominee\u2019s delegate commitment: Why do you believe this delegate should receive an rPGF 2 voting badge?
