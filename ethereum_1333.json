Either the bomb can be readjusted at that time, or removed all together.      This file has been truncated. show original      The delay is 500,000 extra blocks from the previous delay. The adjustment is less than would be expected because the difficulty is so much higher today than previous adjustments.  image2774\u00d71212 176 KB  There is a script in there as well to play around with cr: @vbuterin It will be helpful to re-run the numbers from time to time as the difficulty changes to make sure we are on target. A severe drop In difficulty could lead to increased block times seemingly out of nowhere. ",

As per your comment on Github we would start to see the bomb go off in November:  Reference block 12382958 (May-06-2021 08:38:33 PM +UTC) Nov - 5 months - 1.9% + .2 seconds Dec - 6 months - 7.6% + 1 second Jan - 7 months - 30% + 4 seconds Feb - 8 months - 121% + 16 seconds March - 9 months - 487% + 64 seconds  I personally would feel more confident if that first delay started in December vs. November. Roughly, it seems there are ~200 000 blocks in a month (2.628e+6 secs ./ ~13 sec = 202153 ~= 200000). Would this change be as simple as swapping 9,500,000 for 9,700,000 ? ",
