Request for an updated Burn-Rate Estimate for the rest of 2022 based on the many budget requests that have been posted in the last 48 hours. Can you please provide a rough analysis based on 100% of the budgets request getting approved, 75%, 50% \u2014 is that possible? If not, no worries\u2014totally understand that you have other tasks to tackle. I guess gauging oracles cost might also not help in providing the net-burn-rate\u2026 ",
