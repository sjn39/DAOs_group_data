                    "content": "GovAlpha is submitting this Signal Request to determine support for increasing the minimum threshold to trigger an emergency shutdown via the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) from 100,000 MKR to 150,000 MKR. GovAlpha recommends that Maker Governance raises the ESM minimum threshold to reduce the threat to the Maker Protocol of a hostile emergency shutdown. The current state of the ESM can be seen on the voting portal here. Currently, 0.00042 MKR have been deposited to the ESM. The current minimum threshold is 100,000 MKR as a result of this Signal Request, this Governance Poll, and this Executive Vote. It is prudent to consider the optimal amount of MKR required to trigger emergency shutdown. Maker Governance must strike a balance between making it prohibitively expensive for a malicious actor to buy or borrow sufficient MKR and leaving the minimum threshold low enough that Maker Governance can achieve a beneficial emergency shutdown if required. Given the recent fall in the price of the MKR token it has become more affordable to perform an emergency shutdown. Examples of situations where emergency shutdown may be performed and considered beneficial include, but are not limited to:  Discovery of a critical bug in the Maker Protocol. Prevention of a malicious governance attack threatening the ongoing viability of the Maker Protocol.  It is worth noting that delegate contracts cannot interact with the ESM. Delegates cannot deposit MKR they have been delegated into the ESM.  Pros  Increases the economic cost of performing a hostile emergency shutdown of the Maker Protocol. Provides greater certainty for DAO contributors, DAI users, and vault owners.   Cons  Makes it more challenging to perform a beneficial emergency shutdown of the Maker Protocol.   Question    Do you support raising the ESM minimum threshold 150,000 MKR?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This signal request will run for two weeks until 2022-05-16T00:00:00Z. An on-chain poll will follow if the result is a \u201cYes\u201d vote. We intend to collaborate with the Data Insights Core Unit to produce a data-driven recommended minimum threshold. Still, we felt it necessary to gauge community sentiment in the short term given recent price action. Once this is in place, a further Signal Request may follow. ",

Activating emergency shutdown is one of the explicit functions of the MKR token, along with voting in governance and being used to recapitalise the system in the event of bad debt. If we signalled for a specific DAI amount - e.g. 200 million DAI worth of MKR (roughly what 150k MKR is worth atm) - we would need to alter the parameter in the ESM contract as the price of MKR rises and falls. This would likely require more governance overhead in the way of polls etc. Personally, I would be uncomfortable allowing a CU to insert this type of change into an exec without a poll prior. This could be automated with an IAM - but that would require us to have an MKR-DAI oracle feed running, which I don\u2019t believe we have at present. An IAM would also (probably) require a new module design which would be a fairly low engineering priority at this time, given all the other items PE have to work on. ",

If I understand you correctly, what you suggest is to still use MKR tokens as the trigger, but dynamically change the amount of MKR you would need based on its Dai price? In that case you would need a Dai/MKR Oracle, and that would introduce an additional (and probably larger) risk, which is that you could attack the Oracles to call ES. ",

This is a timely point - at the current price ($1,140) in theory it would cost only ~$113m for a malicious actor to launch a devastating attack on Maker. Of course there are liquidity issues with purchasing (or borrowing) that much MKR but I don\u2019t think those issues would stop a sufficiently determined attacker. Some actors in crypto have deep, deep pockets. Increasing the ESM to 150m makes sense in this context, with lower MKR prices possibly (probably) on their way. ",

For example, purchasing $60M worth of MKR incurs almost 90% in slippage across DEXes. The other thing to keep in mind is how devastating such an attack would actually be to the protocol. It would be a pain for users but vault owners could still withdraw their collateral without any issues. DAI would go off peg but depending on market movements after the shutdown and what assets back it, it could go either up or down relative to USD. The Maker protocol could then be restarted and the attacker would have burned over 15% of MKR supply by doing this. Not the best outcome but might not be the worst outcome either! ",

I guess one use of the ESM is if we know the protocol is going to collapse, and we want to try to save DAI Holders as much as possible. Like if we took on $1B of bad debt, we might want to trigger it before the bank run fully sets in. I\u2019m less and less convinced it\u2019s effective from an emergency response PoV though. There\u2019s also the minority threat to help keep governance in a mood to compromise. If 10% (15% if this passes) of governance want to shut it down, they can, so the other 90% of governance can\u2019t just ignore their concerns. ",

For example, purchasing $60M worth of MKR incurs almost 90% in slippage  across DEXes. The other thing to keep in mind is how devastating such an attack would actually be to the protocol. It would be a pain for users but vault owners could still withdraw their collateral without any issues. DAI would go off peg but depending on market movements after the shutdown and what assets back it, it could go either up or down relative to USD. The Maker protocol could then be restarted and the attacker would have burned over 15% of MKR supply by doing this. Not the best outcome but might not be the worst outcome either!   Good points - the silver lining I guess of low liquidity on MKR! In addition, helpful governance proposals like the one below have been passed, reducing the borrowing limit on MKR and forcing would-be attackers to the illiquid markets if they want to get enough voting power.    compound.finance    Compound Compound is an algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol built for developers, to unlock a universe of open financial applications.

I agree analysis and data would be useful. As noted in the OP, we are partnering with DIN-001 to produce a data-driven recommended minimum threshold in due course. @AstronautThis is leading this from the GovAlpha side.     MakerMan:  What is too long 6hrs, or 48hrs.   So, from my perspective, the time to enact ES would need to be less than the GSM Pause Delay as one of the main situations we would use ES would be when a malicious proposal gains control of the hat and we aren\u2019t able to get it back and cancel that proposal before it executes. In this scenario, if hat > ESM minimum threshold then the defence would be to trigger the ESM to protect the protocol. At this point, I am inclined to agree with @TheExistence in his conclusions on this post that we should consider increasing the GSM Pause Delay to bring it more in line Aave and provide more protection to the Maker Protocol to reduce the risk of an ES being required.     MakerMan:  Where is the discussion about whether at this point other approaches could be taken to halt Maker, vs. ES the system. (i.e. is the ES outdated).   This is also discussion that could be had, but represents a massive change to the Maker Protocol. As noted in the OP and in @LongForWisdom\u2019s post above there are valid reasons for ES to exist and while it does, we need to keep an eye on relevant parameters.     MakerMan:  How about a different model where say a combination of delegates, CUs and others all sign to be able to enact a ES.   I don\u2019t think delegates or CUs should have the ability to trigger ES. Imagine the legal fallout for a delegate or for CUs that burned other people\u2019s MKR to trigger an ES, this is an incredibly risky path to take. Unless you mean a completely new system that wouldn\u2019t require burning MKR?     MakerMan:  Where is even the remotest ES firedrill test with MKR and IOU holders signing a message to signal they would be willing to act to measure this.   A firedrill is a good idea. Perhaps this is something @psychonaut and IS could help with in due course. Although whether it is truly possible to simulate an ES scenario remains to be seen, so results may be of limited value. I think you\u2019ve made a number of good points here though. This could be a good idea for an issue discussion call to discuss in more detail @gov-comms-core-unit.     ACREinvest:  Is there a current specific threat this particular poll is designed to address?   No, this wasn\u2019t aimed at a specific threat.

Perhaps it is useful for an intermediate update here on this initiative. The main focus of DIN-001 and GovAlpha now is asking how high the ESM threshold should be to prevent it from being used by external actors when there is nothing wrong with the protocol. Specifically, how profitable would it be for an attacker to execute variants of the following attack:     flipflopflapdelegate:  what\u2019s stopping someone from burning 100,000 MKR, while shorting MKR on a CEX, and shorting both stETH and ETH? Oh and DAI   When someone does this, the attacker incurs the cost of burning the MKR. Based on total MKR available to borrow across DeFi and CEXes, the maximum profit that can be made by shorting is limited - the attacker runs out of liquidity. Our goal currently is to ensure that the cost of triggering the ESM significantly exceeds the potential profits that can be made by shorting MKR. There are more nuanced variants of the same attack but broadly, this is what we need to protect against. We expect to have a dashboard with available MKR to borrow, MKR price and other market dependent factors which then lets us set a safe ESM threshold. Shorting DAI/ETH in such a situation is not necessarily profitable. Vault owners will not lose any of their collateral and DAI will remain backed by all the collateral we hold. While triggering the ESM inconveniences DAI holders and users, it is not comparable to the effect of UST losing its peg rapidly and causing chaos across DeFi and crypto. The ESM is specifically designed to allow it to be triggered without causing that sort of chaos. Lastly, even our assumption of the MKR token\u2019s price collapsing when the ESM is triggered is very generous to an attacker. In reality, even shorting MKR might not pay off - the attacker is burning 10-15% of MKR supply in one go and triggering the ESM does not mean the end of the Maker protocol - it can be restarted almost immediately! So while this is an important issue to consider, I personally disagree that it is time-critical enough that it needs to be expedited instead of following the usual governance timeline. This is more a move made out of an overabundance of caution, as described by Long. The second part to setting the ESM threshold is understanding when the ESM should be legitimately triggered and if the ESM process incentivizes people to do so during those times. This is a much harder question to answer and many of the @MakerMan\u2019s points below are important questions     MakerMan:   How long would it take to muster 150K to shutdown the system (delegates can\u2019t do this)? What is too long 6hrs, or 48hrs. Where is even the remotest ES firedrill test with MKR and IOU holders signing a message to signal they would be willing to act to measure this. Where is the discussion about whether at this point other approaches could be taken to halt Maker, vs. ES the system. (i.e. is the ES outdated). How about a different model where say a combination of delegates, CUs and others all sign to be able to enact a ES.  Put simply I see the ES as an attack vector.   My main additions to this would be   It is not yet clear exactly what specific circumstances would be classified as a legitimate use of the ESM. A critical protocol bug and malicious governance are the two oft used examples but both of those are not precise enough. If we do not know when the ESM should be triggered, then it is unlikely that we would be able to convince MKR holders to do so.   Financial incentives when such a situation occurs are also unclear. If MKR holders were made aware of a critical bug, it is likely to be more profitable for them to simply sell their MKR and rebuy later than to deposit their MKR into the ESM. While fire drills help, they do not capture this aspect of a real emergency where financial incentives are very different.       LongForWisdom:  There\u2019s also the minority threat to help keep governance in a mood to compromise. If 10% (15% if this passes) of governance want to shut it down, they can, so the other 90% of governance can\u2019t just ignore their concerns.    I see your point about this but in such a situation, is it realistic to expect the 10% to organize and deposit their MKR into the ESM before the majority simply raises the ESM threshold or disables the ESM altogether? The current GSM Pause Delay is 48 hours and this is not compatible with this scenario. I\u2019m not even sure a week or more would be enough. I think it\u2019s more likely that such a minority would simply sell off their MKR holdings and move on to other things, if this were to happen.  In summary, for this part, I think we do need a lot more thought before we can say something concrete. Raising the ESM to a number that might be \u201ctoo high\u201d is equivalent to disabling the ESM for all practical purposes. I agree completely with the following assessment     LongForWisdom:  The severity of it being too high is quite low, the severity of it being too low is much, much higher.

I don\u2019t see among us who exactly would be throwing the 100k or 150k MKR in there without at least a discussion first, at which point, it may as well be a vote. If someone could somehow single-handed accumulate that much MKR, but none of us would do it ourselves, it\u2019s just an attack vector. Not a low. hanging fruit one, though. I\u2019d wager we can set the parameter almost arbitrarily.y. I vote for 125,000. ",

It is simpler is to see how much MKR exists on DEXes, CEXes and lending platforms. To first order (i.e. before holders resupply such platforms after they are drained), this is the maximum amount of MKR that can be borrowed by any attacker. We also have a data set with wallets that own large amounts of MKR. That tells you how many whales need to collude before the ESM can be triggered. One can also consider attacks which are a combination of the above two. With some generous safety factors, this is enough to establish a sufficiently high ESM threshold. Right now, DIN-001 is working on some final touches to the dataset and we will also need to run this by the Risk CU but as soon as that\u2019s done, we will be publishing them! ",
