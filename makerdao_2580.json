                    "content": "A topic that always fell a bit short in the Maker Governance and Risk call was onboarding new collateral. By the very nature the GNR call was always more focused on shorter term or more immediate topics such as the state the peg and discussing risk parameters. At the same time there are now a few dozen new collateral applications. I have hosted a few calls in the past to discuss new collateral types (some of the ones we\u2019ve been proposing as Centrifuge) but also just opening it up to whoever else was interested in engaging in a more interactive dialog with the community. After a longer break (previous calls can be found here: Collateral Onboarding Call (MIPs #6-12): Discussion and Review of Collateral Onboarding Process) we want to re-introduce these calls and make them a bit more formal. To start out with, I\u2019m offering to moderate these calls as a community member to create a place for these discussions to happen. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll iterate over the exact format but for now here\u2019s what it will look like. Every two weeks on Wednesday at 17:00 UTC // 19:00 CET // 10am PST we\u2019ll host a one hour zoom call open for anyone to join. The first one will be this Wednesday the 12th. We\u2019ll post a forum thread with the invite, agenda and after the call the recording and a summary on the forum. As for the format, we\u2019re going to try to stick to the following for now, but open to feedback and iterations. We\u2019ll try to have 2 projects/collateral types present on their collateral overall or a particular topic with a 10min presentation and then following that with 20min of discussion and Q&A. We\u2019ll use this forum thread to coordinate setting the agenda and proposing members to present on the call. If you would like to present in the call, please indicate so with a short proposal in the following thread: Collateral Calls - Calling all Projects! ",
