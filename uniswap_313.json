As that is what it was promoted as - An ecosystem allowing those who jumped onto the opportunity with knowing the risks involved, Surely even considering the congestion on Uniswap - Of course people will be using alternatives ( while still using UNISWAP anyway ) I get the financial implications but  on the same side - Adoption is needed in this industry, Excluding a massive market because they used 1inch / Mooniswap to get the swap done quicker cant be neglected. The Funds will promote all the DEX\u2019S anyway as most would be silly to sell their acquired rewards - Increasing the HOLD potential for the DEFI / DEX market. This is a no brainier in terms of customer support - However the financial side of things will be better as well because then the ETH FEES will undoubtedly be forgiven and only increase the use case for the the entire industry.
