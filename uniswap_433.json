This delay could become a major point of voter suppression, as most users will likely delegate because of the current proposal being voted on. We have seen major voter apathy in other projects like Maker and Compound. Most UNI holders will not be proactive and delegate their vote just to be ready in case something they actually care about pops up. They\u2019ll look to delegate and vote immediately when a triggering issue arises. I would like to see a modification to the governance contract to allow UNI holders to delegate and immediately vote, rather than being delayed until the next proposal. Before we run a poll, I thought it would make sense to understand the tech implications of how this could be accomplished and if there are any trade-offs that I\u2019m not thinking of. Please share thoughts on how the above could be accomplished with code, and what side-effects it may cause. ",

To preserve voter autonomy, we need to be able to delegate and undelegate if multiple issues are up for a vote at any given time. If multiple issues can not be put up for a vote simultaneously, we should be considering the risks of miring ourselves into a somewhat plodding governance structure. There\u2019s a happy medium in here somewhere, I\u2019m just throwing out some knock-on effects of both sides of this. I very much appreciate an eye towards mitigating governance attacks by unfaithful actors\u2013however we move forward with this, that should be at the forefront. ",

Delegates have the ability to move a proposal to a formal vote. The community can recommend proposals, but it\u2019s no longer an autonomous function. Just make the trigger multi-sig. Here\u2019s the trade-off. Pros -No single person can shove a deleterious proposal through on volume of UNI alone Cons -No longer a decentralized function either.- Prone to internal politics, and can easily be utilized to stall efforts to progress the platform   Do none of the above, but let\u2019s continue with the idea of an \u2018approved delegate\u2019. Here is the post-hoc solution. If an attack is imminent, then give them a multi-sig ability to \u2018cancel\u2019 a vote. Pros -No single person can pull off an attack Cons -not decentralized when you give a small group \u2018veto\u2019 power -may also expose a critical weakness of multi-sig, because it assumes all delegates are paying attention and \u2018able\u2019 to vote   Extend the power of a governor. This \u2018governor\u2019 address (presumably uniswap employee) already has the override power to \u2018cancel\u2019 a vote. A classic fail-safe mechanism that is built into the code, unless i\u2019m reading it incorrectly. There should be an \u2018appeal\u2019 process that allows us to ask the Governor to \u2018cancel\u2019 a vote. Pros -Nothing in the code needs changing -No single bad agent can get away with an attack Cons -can be misused in a trustless system   this is a matter for a different post altogether, but we are at the stage where the foundational assumptions behind \u2018decentralized social groups\u2019 should be challenged.  there is no historical precedence for this social entity working effectively. social anthropology says \u2018no\u2019 - do not try to equate this to hunter/gatherers - different scale - different problem behavioural economics says \u2018no\u2019 - human social progress is not a formative, rational, or ethical system - it is darwinian - it doesn\u2019t give a gnats\u2019 ass about which form of social organization we take. besides, modern capitalism is on the verge of collapse. there are many reasons for this, but my favourite is the critical assumption that Adam Smith got wrong in \u2018wealth of nations\u2019. he assumed, incorrectly, that given an economic choice, every human being would make a choice that improved the state of the social group. kahneman eloquently dismantled that argument on his way towards getting a nobel prize.  so, maybe a \u2018hybrid\u2019 model that mixes decentralized with centralized structures. the purists will cry foul because they prefer to see the universe as a convenient, non-quantum, arrangement of 1s and 0s. fair enough, the clockmakers among us may be right in the end, but i have my doubts. the point of innovation is to \u2018temporarily suspend your disbelief\u2019, because it\u2019s the only way to trigger the novelty center of the brain. if we remain stuck in our beliefs, and hold them as sacrosanct pillars, we may as well let go of any claim to critical thought. otherwise, a purist approach to decentralization will succeed, or not, on the assumption that humans can align on matters of mutual benefit. find precedence and i may be convinced. this is why satoshi was brilliant - he turned it into an economic challenge, and deferred the question of \u2018trust\u2019 to one of economic viability. here\u2019s the irony. in order for a truly \u2018decentralized\u2019 system to work, we would have to abandon selfish needs and privilege the group over the self. in that system we no longer rely on PoW or PoS to achieve consensus on anything.  i fear we are mixing decentralized wealth, identity, ownership of data (SELF) with decentralized governance (SOCIAL). the fact that it works so well with one, does not automagically confer the same outcome for the other.

It provides the necessary safety check for the system and allows for voter mobilization. It also, albeit not perfectly, allows the UNI/ETH LP tokens to participate in the governance matters if they\u2019re perceived as critical. I also support the concern that 48 hours might not be enough - but it shouldn\u2019t be more than a week. I don\u2019t think that the preparation period should be shorter than the voting period. If anything, it takes more time to review, audit, and discuss than to vote. I could see a 6-day preparation - 4-day voting sequence working fine, as an example. ",
