Also, it would be really good to know the carbon footprint of a typical Layer 2 transaction when on the consensus layer. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of information on this either. The Layer 2 we are looking at is Arbitrum but happy to take some generic average values for a typical Layer 2 transaction if anyone can point me in the right direction. Many thanks ",

                    "content": "This is completely theoretical, but my logic is as follows:  Everyone who validates blocks wants to make a profit To make a profit, the energy cost of validating blocks must be less than the expected reward of validating those blocks. According to Carbon Footprint Factsheet | Center for Sustainable Systems, each kWh generated in the U.S. results in an average of 0.889 pounds of CO2e. According to Annual Electricity Price Comparison by State, Louisiana has the lowest energy cost, of 7.51 cents per kWh. Fast gas fees on arbitium are about 2.71 cents per 20k gas right now. Therefore, 20k gas, from this analysis, releases a maximum of 0.32079760319 pounds of CO2e.  There\u2019s almost certainly some problems with this analysis, but this is my rough estimate. Here are more figures for other chains (for 20k gas): PoW Ethereum: 22.4913448735 pounds of CO2e Binance Chain: 0.48599334699 pounds Polygon Chain: 0.01873114713 pounds Gnosis Chain: 0.00098682669 pounds EDIT: The lowest energy prices are found in Libya, at 0.7 cents per kWh (source: Worldwide electricity pricing \u2013 energy cost per KWh in 230 countries | Cable.co.uk), with 0.55 pounds of CO2e per kWh (source: Libya: CO2 Country Profile - Our World in Data). This gives these updated stats per 20k gas: Arbitium: 2.12928571425 pounds (2236 visa transactions per transfer) PoW Ethereum: 149.285714286 pounds (156750 visa transactions per transfer) Binance Chain: 3.22576814999 pounds (3387 visa transactions per transfer) Polygon Chain: 0.12432749995 pounds (131 visa transactions per transfer) Gnosis Chain: 0.00655003638 pounds (7 visa transactions per transfer) ",

                    "content": "Thanks @Pandapip1 The rough numbers are a good starting point. To be fair, I don\u2019t fully understand Arbitrum but I\u2019ve been tasked to do the numbers. Do you know how many transactions on Arbitrum when rolled up would equate to 20k gas if we assume say an average of $10 per transaction (smart contract NFT type transactions)? Or, can you point me in the direction of a formula? I guess this depends on how many transactions are rolled up into the single transaction that is then sent to the mainnet. Don\u2019t suppose you know anything about this? My understanding is that Arbitrum can scale transactions such that we can choose how many times a day for example the rolled up transactions are written back to the mainnet. Assuming we can do this, it allows us to control the number of transactions per day, and therefore, predict our CO2 emissions (roughly). Also, if we wanted to calculate the energy usage / carbon footprint to execute a mint of an NFT based on the number of computational calculations on Arbitrum Layer 2, I assume we need to know the following:  Number of transactions required to execute a mint inside Arbitrum Number of transactions that can be rolled up on Arbitrum that have to be written back to the mainnet.  Sorry for asking so many questions. ",

I guess this depends on how many transactions are rolled up into the single transaction that is then sent to the mainnet. Don\u2019t suppose you know anything about this?
