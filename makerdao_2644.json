I\u2019m not sure how much work (if any) the Foundation has put into this but thought the community should start discussing this so we can start doing things faster. Of course, a lot of this progress hinges on MakerDAO having revenues to pay people but starting the discussion early would give us more time to get it right once we do. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the matter and hopefully we can get a working group going eventually to put these discussions into concrete action. ",

TL;DR it would separate the domain roles into facilitator and contributor. Facilitators would have ultimate responsibility, but they would be able to delegate to contributors more explicitly. This is largely a formalisation of what is happening already, but it would provide a more onboarding-friendly framework. It also defines the structure for a \u2018domain definition\u2019 MIP, which would allow us to create new domains (such as operations, communications, treasury, etc) in a consistent way. Here\u2019s a HackMD version if anyone wants to leave inline feedback. ",
