                    "content": "Hi Everyone, As someone who regularly stares at MakerDAO vault parameters and frequently sees debt ceilings getting maxed, I wanted to learn how to use the DC IAM functions in order to automatically adjust the debt ceilings when possible. @hexonaut was kind enough to educate me on the process and thought it prudent to share what I learned. So if you see a vault type maxed out (or too low) follow this guide in order to raise it further. Step 1 - Determine the hex code Every vault type has a hexadecimal string associated with its name. We can determine what this is based on the name of the vault and then converting it into hex code. Example Let\u2019s use ETH-A as an example. Head over to ASCII to Hex | Text to Hex Code Converter and input \u201cETH-A\u201d into the blank field  Screen Shot 2021-02-11 at 7.12.32 PM679\u00d7714 28.4 KB  To determine the code needed to enter into the IAM contract we add 0x in front to get 0x4554482d41. Lastly we need to ensure the code is 66 characters long so we need to add 54 zeroes for a final input of 0x4554482d41000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 We can repeat this step for any other vault name to get the code associated with that vault type. Step 2 - Input code into the IAM contract The contract can be found here - https://etherscan.io/address/0xc7bdd1f2b16447dcf3de045c4a039a60ec2f0ba3#writeContract Connect to Web3 then head down to \u201c2. exec\u201d. Under \u201c_ilk (bytes32)\u201d is where you will enter the hex code for the vault you wish to adjust. Enter the corresponding code here and hit write!  Screen Shot 2021-02-11 at 7.25.57 PM1248\u00d7382 21.7 KB  Send the transaction and you\u2019ve just adjusted the debt ceiling! Make sure that the ttl (12 hours as of now) has passed or the transaction will fail.  Bonus - Checking the last time the IAM was executed  In order to find out whether it has been more than 12 hours since the IAM was executed so you don\u2019t waste gas, you can do the following. In the etherscan contract go to the \u201cevents\u201d tab and you will see a list of all transactions by date. Look for the latest transaction that includes the hex code (under \u201c[topic1]\u201d) of the Vault you would like to check and the corresponding date (far left). If its been more than 12 hours you\u2019re good!  Screen Shot 2021-02-12 at 8.27.58 AM971\u00d7623 82.9 KB  Thanks for participating in keeping the Maker system healthy!
