I was really excited when I found out that DappCon was planned for July 19. Our organizing teams should make sure that participants in the Council can continue their work through to Dappcon, perhaps via shoulder events. Perhaps at DappCon we can as a group report on what we accomplished. I expect lot of the work will center in contract-related standards. I will contact you and the organizers with more specifics as I am working with @boris and @Danibelle to firm up the agenda for our event. ",

If the lightning talk includes \u201cthis is the EIPs or technical solutions or stuff we need help with\u201d, that would be best. Meetings like this are not conferences for top do@jpitts and I are going to wrangle this into a schedule / agenda tomorrow morning, assume yes, we\u2019ll give people time to meet together and present.

(we started OST in sep17; before in 2016 I was the lead dev of eris-db and worked on Tendermint; and I started out in 2014 by rewriting MaidSafe as lead dev) We\u2019ve been building OpenST (as layer-2) to scale Ethereum (scaling bits per second, users and developers for Ethereum). We ve built a layer-2 compatible open-source block explorer (https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/openst-view hosted on view.ost.com) to make it accesible easily. (in talks on how we can contribute this to ongoing question for OSS block explorers) I would love to do a lightning talk on either Jason Teutsch Verifiers Dilemma and how it is the basis to the scaling proposal (scaling bits per second) for Ethereum, and focus on the hypothesis around the reward structure for validators. Alternatively happy to contribute our thinking and work on wallet UX and how to get tokens securely in the hands millions of new users. and always open to suggestions from all Ben- ",

Are there specific EIPs for either one, or EIPs in general that the Simple Token team care about / have been working on? No worries if there aren\u2019t, working groups are \u201cin scope\u201d for EthMagicians, just that one purpose of EIPs is to drive towards referenceable standards and interop. ",
