As we have a working delegate system now, this situation has improved a lot \u2014 both participation in on-chain polls as well as passing executives is not an issue anymore. This amendment removes the December exception so we can continue to govern the protocol without a break. As the December exception has been the only one so far, this amendment will also remove the containing component as well. If we ever need to make an amendment reintroducing an exception, the component can be reintroduced again.  Amended MIPs and Components Remove MIP51c4: Calendar Exceptions.

While the original pause may no longer be necessary, it is still valuable giving breaks and allow folks to breathe.   Thanks for your comments @fig - a couple from me to counter them: Maker is part of an unstoppable machine. I does not know about closing hours, bank holidays or \u201cmonths were a lot of people try to enjoy their time-off\u201d. We create redundancy by having multiple people in a team, so people can take time off - and we can probably all agree that it is fine that CoreUnits decide to e.g. not create any spells during a certain timeframe unless hell brakes loose. Same is true for delegates, as more and more teams on the Recognized Delegates appear, that can organize themselves on covering those timeframes despite most of their members taking vacations. We already have pretty long-cycled times on most adjustments that go through the MIP cycle, most of the stuff should actually be addressed and sorted out during the RFC period. The issues that are to be decided are quite the opposite of rushed or having a short noticed period. The main reason why we started with the December-exception was because we had issues with getting MKR holders to vote on polls or pass executives. This is no longer the case - we have a pretty good turnout on polls and our ability to pass executives is good enough. Speaking as a Recognized Delegate: I feel that the bar we have for participation in the governance system is already pretty low - and I am even running solo. Imagine Budget proposals that get downvoted shortly before December and that cannot go into a rerun before January. The calendar exception creates an artificial bureaucratic constraint that we can get rid off. ",
