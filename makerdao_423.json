Paragraph Summary The TechOps Core Unit will handle system administration and technical support needs of Maker Protocol and its Core Units. TECH-001 will strive to improve communication and collaboration between the developers, end users, and other stakeholders by applying DevOps principles to software delivery and first-class technical support.  Specification  Motivation TECH-001 is looking forward to passionately support secure, reliable and transparent infrastructure in order to improve MakerDAO\u2019s collaboration, agility, and resilience. Stakeholders in the Maker Ecosystem such as the Maker Community, the Maker Governance, other CUs, and users of the Maker Protocol (DAI holders) know that they can rely on an experienced team to set up and securely maintain their infrastructure.  Core Unit ID TECH-001  Core Unit Name TechOps  Core Unit Team The essential factor of TechOps services is 24/7/365 support. This requires proper coverage across all time zones. The Core Unit team already has a total time zone coverage with Engineers in the Americas (1 Engineer), Europe (2) and APAC (1). We plan to hire another 3 Engineers in the near future to improve time zone coverage, namely in the Americas, Europe and APAC. Another important factor of TechOps services is cost effectiveness. Combining these two factors together (the 24/7/365 support and cost effectiveness), the team will also provide services for other Core Units and commercial entities (subject of separate arrangements), and settle the accounts based on FTE (Full Time Equivalent) allocation. The structure below presents the current team structure built around the mission of providing technical support services to the MakerDAO Ecosystem.     Role People FTE     Facilitator/DevOps Engineer 2 1.6   DevOps Engineer 2 1.6   Project Manager 0 0.0   Operations Consultant 1 0.2   TOTAL 6 3.4    The structure below presents a prospective team structure with planned additional hires.

The main objective is to relieve the Facilitators to focus more on engineering tasks and communications with the community.  Core Unit Mandate  Mission To provide technical support services to MakerDAO stakeholders and liaison with external service providers while ensuring the effectiveness, reliability and security of the MakerDAO infrastructure layer.  Vision TECH-001 is a team of passionate professionals with quality-first attitude, extensive experience in the Maker Ecosystem and a heavy interest in the always developing Web3 space. The infrastructure we deliver is reinforced by:   Reliability - Secure and reliable operations, resulting in high service availability, robust monitoring, and regular safe deployments  Support - 24/7 detection and incident response with high level of redundancy between critical components and team members  Transparency - Accessibility and transparency to other CUs and the broader MakerDAO community. Stakeholders will be kept informed regularly about the state of the infrastructure, its cost structure and the tradeoffs involved  TECH-001 closely collaborates with the stakeholders of the Maker Ecosystem facilitating:   Education - TECH-001 properly educates stakeholders about operational security best practices and regularly reviews them for improvements  Point of contact - TECH-001 facilitates incident response and acts as a first line of support for external security researchers and Maker Ecosystem participants  Integration - New participants in the Maker Ecosystem and third-party integrators can access and reuse infrastructure scripts and recipes from the service catalogue created and maintained by TECH-001   Strategy By following the rapid continuous improvement and innovation cycle between TechOps and other Core Units, we strive to improve communication and collaboration between the developers, end users, and other stakeholders (that is, all participants in the MakerDAO Ecosystem, not just technical Core Units) by applying DevOps and SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) principles.  DevOps868\u00d7407 36.8 KB  Source: atlassian.com  Plan  Establish clear priorities: Ensure that urgent or time sensitive work is prioritised appropriately Conduct peer code reviews: A minimum of two other engineers looking at every code change Limit WIP (Work in Progress): Minimise context switching and improve quality of work Knowledge sharing sessions: Analyse our performance and update the process as necessary   Provision Infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code  Easy to understand and share with others Simple and fast to change, upgrade, and scale Fast feedback from problems   Service Building & Continuous Delivery We work closely with the developers (and other Core Units) to provide them with service delivery pipelines for their service\u2019s code repositories. This allows them to get their work done in smaller batches and automatically deploy new changes, leading to higher quality software and faster feedback from tests and the user.  Monitoring Applications, Protocol & Infrastructure Providing monitoring components such as:  Performance monitoring Insight into system components Metrics, Logs and Dashboards Alerting infrastructure   Continuous Feedback & Transparency  From the Stakeholders: Regular meetings for a chance to hear from the stakeholders with any feedback Metrics and Logs: Monitoring systems setup to gather a constant stream of data to improve our positioning for a more reliable infrastructure   Read the full version of our Mission, Vision and Strategy   Products and Services The main areas of responsibilities are:  Hosting and supporting Critical Maker Components in collaboration with other CUs General System Administration DevOps Services to deliver services reliably Research and Development to future proof the infrastructure we manage  Note: Due to the limited number of FTE resources and costly cloud infrastructure (see Budget MIP), it is up to TECH-001 to triage incoming requests and, in some cases, to declare work as out of scope and infrastructure not critical. Basically TECH-001 will not use DAO funds lightly to support non-critical infrastructure.  Critical Maker Components The TechOps Core Unit will maintain a registry of critical Maker infrastructure and support the activities that it will offer. The team will work with the relevant stakeholders (for example, the Immunefi Security Core Unit, IS-001) to keep this list up-to-date and ensure that it evolves with the changing needs of the MakerDAO Ecosystem and the protocol. The initial list is included below:  Collaboration with other Core Units   Protocol Engineering (PE-001) - Ethereum nodes provisioning, administration and monitoring   Oracle (ORA-001)  Administration, Monitoring and new Collateral onboarding Addition of each new collateral type touches various systems that need to be reconfigured to accept said collateral. Systems such as Oracle Feeds and Relayers, monitoring, dashboards, keepers, changelog and spell whitelisting.  Note: A different MIP will be put forward to the community to transfer the ownership of the current Oracle Feed and Relayers from the Maker Foundation to TECH-001.   Development & UX (DUX-001) - GovPollDB hosting & maintenance   GovAlpha (GOV-001) - Monitoring spells and voting     Immunefi Security (IS-001) - Runbooks for incident response and emergency procedures  VulcanizeDB - Maintenance, hosting, and new collateral support  SAI API - Legacy support    Critical Maker protocol components such as:   Flap auctions   Forum*   Website*   Blog*   Discord administration   Various keepers - open source services to facilitate Maker smart contracts operations  Chief Keeper Cage Keeper  D3M Keeper**  Autoline Keeper** ETH Filler Poker Keeper Drip Keeper  * Note: TECH-001 will only take responsibility for the infrastructure hosting exclusively as Platform Manager, and will not be responsible for the content hosted on these platforms. The team will work with the community and follow the procedures laid out in MIP60 to establish Content Managers for the respective platforms. At the very minimum the contact details of the Content Manager need to be publicly available on the platform. Platforms without a designated Content Manager will be taken offline after a notice period of 70 days. ** Note: Gas costs are not included in our MIP40c3-SP28 budget proposal. TECH-001 will work with the relevant stakeholders and MakerDAO governance to organise the provisioning of ETH to cover these costs. TECH-001 will at any time be managing these funds in service of the MakerDAO community and will at no time take ownership of the assets that are involved in the process. The Maker Protocol will be added as beneficiary in the multisigs that are part of this setup wherever practically feasible.   Infrastructure Monitoring & Alerts: Dashboards, response to alerts and Reports Note: TECH-001 is not responsible for any actions taken from looking at the metrics presented through the dashboards hosted by TECH-001. All the data is public and available to be consumed by everyone.   Development & QA   Infrastructure design, CI/CD pipelines and staging environments   Technical Support: Support CUs we work with, to set up accounts, helping with infrastructure setup and configuration, security best practices education, and so on. 24/7 follow-the-sun support, assessment and remediation   Tools administration and development: 3rd party services administration and management, such as:  Development of Discord bots and integration with other services Grafana dashboards development, which are then made available to others PagerDuty alarms development and integration with other services Development of various keeper services (those listed above and others per community needs) Maintenance of projects used by the keepers (pymaker, pygasprice-client)     General System Administration  Infrastructure hosting for the CUs that we work with Documentation of critical components Cloud providers management  Multiple cloud providers to prevent lock-in, add pricing options and introduce fault tolerance. Automated with Infrastructure as Code.   Network & Security  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Firewall management   Load balancing  Dynamic upstreams and SSL certificates automation   Testing (services and infrastructure) Database administration Secrets and service credentials management Backups & Restore  Database Stateful services filesystem Regular automated restore tests     DevOps Services  Infrastructure as Code Automation  Cloud Environment provisioning Cost management & Optimisations   Source control and artefacts management  GitHub and Docker repositories   CI/CD - Setting up automated delivery and testing pipelines to deploy Maker services to various environments with confidence  Github Actions and other CI systems   Monitoring, Metrics & Alerts  Various server metrics Service availability and performance monitoring   Log Aggregation  Centralised log data storage for easy developer access, analysis and optional alerting   Knowledge Sharing and Training  Expected to be continuously learning Provide environment for safe experimentation Regular knowledge sharing presentations within the team and to outside stakeholders     Roadmap and R&D/POC  Ongoing improvements of the cloud infrastructure redundancy by further diversifying availability zones, regions, and service providers Explore new decentralised infrastructure architectures introduced by Web3, e.g., IPFS Eth2 nodes administration Container orchestration on Kubernetes Chaos Engineering implementation for testing the redundancy of components Mapping and establishing Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Made popular by Google, SLOs are a tool to help determine what engineering work to prioritise, therefore increasing reliability of services   Related Documents  MIP40c3-SP28: TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget MIP41c4-SP28: TechOps Core Unit - Facilitator Onboarding - Simon MIP41c4-SP28: TechOps Core Unit - Facilitator Onboarding - Dumitru  ",

                    "content": "Hi @flipflopflapdelegate , Thank you for your questions and input. We already started working with the Forta team and Nethermind which wrote code for a couple of agents that we suggested and tested in the first phase. Forta agents are designed to watch on-chain events (that is they are exercised and evaluate transactions on each block mined) so they\u2019re not quite suitable for off chain monitoring like API integrations - but we can check with the Forta team if that\u2019s something that they considered. As part of the Proof Of Concept we suggested and tested agents for monitoring:   Oracles Security Module (checking that price update happens at the top of each hour, price deviation between current and queued price does not exceed a certain threshold, notify on rely / deny events)   Emergency Shutdown Module (events like MKR deposited in ESM contract or ESM triggered event)   Governance Module (monitor events like new hat lifted and making sure it\u2019s a valid one, checking the MKR on hat does not fall behind a certain threshold, )   Looking further we\u2019d like to accommodate other agents like watching big movements of MKR tokens (that could signal potential governance attacks), MKR liquidity on DEXes, etc. As part of the TOCU mission we\u2019re going to elaborate and propose a list of agents to the community that we can start with and improve, then we\u2019ll supervise the entire cycle from development, testing and publishing agents to running them. To note that most of the above is already covered by existing monitoring setup (that was built in the last years since MCD launch) - by deploying Forta agents we\u2019re looking to complement this setup and to improve the protocol\u2019s resiliency in a decentralized way. As stated in the proposal, TechOps is using infrastructure as a code approach, where most of the configuration and setup that we do is done through code updates. This code is currently in the private repositories, but we have plans to make it public and available to everybody. We haven\u2019t made any steps towards AI or ML yet mostly due to being busy with multiple projects and tasks. We were thinking about that, but at the moment I would not make any promises. We do use an automation approach, where most of the tasks and jobs run without human interaction. Some tasks have been automated from being done manually before to being automatically done through programmatic code. However, frankly speaking, doing many updates whenever there is a change in the system, still has to be done manually. We recognise that this is an unavoidable part of work and takes our time away from more important tasks.We have plans to improve some of these processes, e.g. take new contracts on-chain, use auto-updates in routine tasks, etc. You are right that we proposed two facilitators - myself (Dumitru) and Simon. That is done due to the \u201calways on\u201d nature of the team. Almost all our work is based on 24/7/365 monitoring, monitoring infrastructure, creating environments, deploying code, and improving CI/CD processes. Everything has to be done without interruptions. The rest of the team is also created (and planned to expand) in a similar way - to cover all the time zones, day and night. We believe that having two facilitators (in EU and APAC regions) right from the Core Unit start will consolidate the team\u2019s global presence, solve the \u2018team being disconnected\u2019 problem, as well as make the team constantly listening and reporting to the community. Let me know if you have any questions to the above. I would be very happy to answer. ",

Essentially they argued how it would not be scalable to per say have every core unit directly interface with Protocol Engineering. Obviously collaboration will occur if both core units are aligned however one core unit can\u2019t assume another core unit is required to collaborate. ",

While TechOps hasn\u2019t craved a lot of attention it should be clear that the Maker Protocol is set for failure sooner or later without a reliable and efficient Techops support. I have worked with most of the team behind this proposal in Maker Foundation. They have consistently delivered above expectation without drawing a lot of attention. They have pulled through with a Can-Do spirit and have never scoffed at the work they were asked to perform.

Because of that, we will revise the plan of looking for the new team members in the new year from the original 3 to 4:  3 DevOps Engineers 1 Project Manager  Therefore the number of current FTEs and the MKR vesting table were updated accordingly to reflect the above. Second, during the TOCU Pod Session call we\u2019ve received some valuable feedback from the Community. One of the things that was mentioned is a public roadmap. Since we are not a product team and most of our work is related to supporting the protocol\u2019s health, it makes it challenging to predict the services that we\u2019ll be offering down the road. However, we decided to come up with a list of things that are mainly POC and R&D focused that we plan to achieve in the next year after TOCU is planned to start operating. We should be finalising a version presented together with the official MIP sometime in January 2022. We will also have to chose a platform where we have the roadmap published for best consumption. Right now we\u2019re choosing between Notion, Canny and a couple of others. As always, keep the questions coming and happy holidays! ",
