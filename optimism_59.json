To tackle this situation and further govern new proposals properly, we should now focus on forming a sphere as per area of interest, and each sphere should be given a budget per quarter to spend from governance fund\u2026 For example: To govern NFT ecosystem, we should focus on building \u2018NFT Sphere\u2019 with 4-5 leads voted by members of DAO, leads are subject to votes every quarter\u2026(leads may change as per results of every quarter) And all the other participating members in an respective sphere should be given a role of contributor. Same goes with other area of interest. This approach not only help to govern ecosystem properly but also helps to take decision faster and efficiently and will help ecosystem to have some amazing products/protocol flowing in with time\u2026 Thank you Piyush ",
