Nadia led the talk, \u201cGrowing as a DAO - MakerDAO Lessons Learned\u201d at the conference. We also arranged a partners dinner where we discussed our current partnerships and plans with people from Binance, Nexo, Crypto.com, Gnosis, SocGen, and Centrifuge, among others.   Collaboration with BanklessDAO   We have once again partnered with the amazing BanklessDAO  to educate the DeFi community on our Multichain Strategy 1 and what it means for their DAI. This was an in-depth technical piece explaining the difference between Canonical and Wrapped DAI, and was also featured in the Bankless Weekly Newsletter. Click here for the article.   Integration of Dai on hashport  With this integration, Dai becomes one of the first stablecoins on hashport. Dai also becomes the first multi-collateralized stablecoin available on Hedera. Hedera is the most used enterprise-grade public network and its DeFi ecosystem keeps growing. That\u2019s why Dai is a fundamental piece of Hedera. You can refer to the blog post and tweet announcement by hashport or our tweet thread for more information.    Fiscal Year Budget Closure  Starting last year, we switched from posting our PnL in the forum to sharing it with @strat-fin-core-unit  and having a public spreadsheet with all the information. With our FY22 budget approved, we have closed FY21 and returned* the unused funds to the protocol. Here is a summary of the FY22 Budget closure:  Monthly costs breakdown  image1384\u00d7690 87.5 KB   Summary FY21 Current number of FTE: 9.25 Approved DAI budget:                   3.524.785,00 DAI Actual until the end of June:         2.936.581,66 DAI Buffer (approved on latest MIP):     350.000,00 DAI Total Actual:                                     3.286.581,66 DAI To return:                                            238.203,34 DAI Approved max MKR year 1:                    803,18 MKR MKR year 1 according to current FTE:   740,00 MKR To return:                                                     63,18 MKR *Based on our conversation with @prose11, we decided to vest from the Growth Stream just the needed amount and left there the unused funds. That means we won\u2019t use anymore the MKR stream #2 and the DAI stream #14.  General updates   Business development We closed four integrations in July.

With this proposal, we want to incentivize Dai usage on Optimism by rewarding Optimism Dai users who have been legitimately involved in the Optimism ecosystem. Inspired by the mechanism Optimism used with the OP token launch, we planned a schedule to reward users who got to perform certain tasks to receive OP incentives. \u201cThe Interstellar Dai Journey\u201d consist of a series of stages that will take Dai holders to the Optimism Universe, rewarding them for their Dai usage. You can find the proposal here.  Maker Teleport Grant   After Maker Teleport\u2019s official announcement, we activated a 10,000 DAI grant for any builder who integrates Maker Teleport with a functional user interface. Do you know someone who might be interested? send them this link with all the details of the grant.  New Collaterals: rETH and GNO   We welcome two new collaterals in Maker. Although their liquidity and therefore their DC is less than what we usually demand, these two collaterals are highly important for Maker:  rETH: by onboarding it, Maker is proclaming its support for the decentralized success of the Ethereum network. As a step towards that outcome, the diversification of Ethereum node operators is crucial and growing accessibility for staking is needed. GNO: As you might know, Gnosis Chain uses DAI to pay for gas fees, tightening the ties that unite both projects. GnosisDAO is also one of the main vault users using  stETH collateral, and with the onboarding, they committed to maintain no less than 75% of stablecoin borrowing activities with Maker.

Click here for more information.   Hack Money 2022  We sponsored the Hack Money Hackathon from May 6th to 27th and gave the participants the MakerDAO wishlist, a set of ideas that the DAO wants to be converted into solutions. During the Hackathon, Mori and Luis presented \u201cHow MakerDAO keeps building on DAI\u201d to explain to developers how to build on top of Maker and during that month, they helped the groups of devs to build their ideas. The winners for this Hack Money edition are:   Maker Teleport UI \u2013 Teleporter by Roshan Palakkal --: The Teleporter is a Maker Teleport UI, allowing the Maker Teleport to be used by anyone with a simple UI and smooth UX, being then the first UI to integrate the Maker Teleport.

                    "content": " Growth Monthly Update, September 2022  Highlights of the month     PSM Yield Offering   Since the PSM creation, our community has been thinking about how to optimize Maker\u2019s PCV, and we have been looking for alternatives. We joined forces with SFCU to create a revenue share strategy using Maker\u2019s assets and started conversations with various stablecoin players in the ecosystem. After months of negotiations, we received the Coinbase USDC Institutional rewards proposal (MIP81) and the Gemini Marketing Initiative in September. As we thought, these posts inspired others to present similar proposals in the forum: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP86) and OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87). Although we can\u2019t reveal the names, we have been talking with others and expect new proposals in the following weeks.  Binance Card   Increasing DAI demand is highly related to helping with DAI adoption, which is why we think it is important to maintain a closer relationship with the companies taking the lead on this mission. Over the last years, Binance has developed solutions for people to adopt crypto by reducing the complexity of how we buy, sell, save, invest and spend it, converting themselves into a crypto bank widely used in emergent markets. We are working with Binance to be part of their adoption strategy, and in the following weeks, we will launch a campaign focus on Latam, starting in Argentina, to increase DAI adoption through the Binance Card.  Devcon and Growth\u2019s offsite   The Growth team went to Colombia for Devcon and our offsite. During Devcon, the team spoke with old partners and newer projects interested in doing something with us in helping Maker to increase Dai supply and demand. The offsite was an opportunity to review the last two quarters, align on our strategic objectives and prepare our execution plan for Q4-22 and Q1-23. Here are some highlights from the Growth team about it:  Jenn: Projects like \u201cDefience\u201d, a new crypto payments tool that allows payment to DAO contributors or service providers in any fiat- crypto and vice versa in scheduled batches (ie. pay every week, 2 weeks etc). Or \u201cDebt Dao\u201d, a new protocol that helps facilitate loans to DAOs who use their revenue/treasury as collateral for stablecoin loans, all onchain. A large theme across Devcon was on L2s and particularly ZK rollups. There is interest from different ZK and Optimistic roll-up teams like Scroll and Metis to have the native DAI bridge integrated and of course MCD deployed as an application following on from Optimism, Arbitrum and Starknet. Rajiv: Devcon was all about making connections and forging relationships and bonds - this is true both internally and externally. Within the Growth team, 3 days together at our team offsite allowed us to align on our strategic objectives whilst having a lot of fun ! But also prior to that just the fact of being together gave us the opportunity to collaborate for a Bloomberg article looking to cover the MakerDAO ecosystem. Meeting and collaborating with other teams within the DAO and sharing ideas is also invaluable, The Maker team dinner and DAIvinity event provided opportunity to do just that. These events also give the opportunity to forge stronger bonds with partners and sitting down with the likes of Gnosis and RocketPool teams allowed us to align on go-to-market plans for their upcoming collateral additions, and finally its always great to meet new projects and understand how they are seeing the market. Tobal: Devcon\u2019s biggest opportunity was meeting many contributors and members of the MakerDAO community. It was amazing to be present at the moment when a big community that seems to be always spread all over the world finally comes together to share the same purpose with the same vibe we\u2019ve been feeling, but this time in real life. I want to thank you all for making that moment really special, and, on top of that, for all your contributions during Devcon\u2019s talks and workshops. Luis: at DevCon had the pleasure to finally meet my team and all the other Maker folks. I believe since we spend so much time behind a screen these reunions give you the energy to move forward and continue doing what you like, in my case I\u2019ve been 4 years around Maker and its community and it\u2019s amazing to know that all of them are incredible persons in real life. DevCon gave a huge space for learning and to let the world know that Latam exists and loves crypto. I can\u2019t wait for the next one and see how people will look at Maker with the new paradigm of the MetaDAOs. (btw, huge shout out to Luigi, the mind behind Maker billboards in Bogota during Devcon)    twitter.com    Maker @MakerDAO  El Dorado, Bogot\u00e1 airport, welcomed all #DevconVI participants by reminding us what we are and why we were there \u2014 A decentralized community being reunited to celebrate our achievements and look forward to the future of Ethereum. \u2708\ufe0f https://t.co/MHUe6xY9KK    5:35 PM - 19 Oct 2022           7              Transparency Dashboard  Check our Notion to find all you want to know about the Growth CU.

                    "content": "    MakerGrowth:   Binance Card   Increasing DAI demand is highly related to helping with DAI adoption, which is why we think it is important to maintain a closer relationship with the companies taking the lead on this mission. Over the last years, Binance has developed solutions for people to adopt crypto by reducing the complexity of how we buy, sell, save, invest and spend it, converting themselves into a crypto bank widely used in emergent markets. We are working with Binance to be part of their adoption strategy, and in the following weeks, we will launch a campaign focus on Latam, starting in Argentina , to increase DAI adoption through the Binance Card.   I love this news, now, since Binance is our shield from regional regulations, what are the possibilities of being able to use Binance as an intermediary to allow loans according to international interest rates or a little more. And for these loans to be paid, they must be verified Binance users who have handled \u201cx\u201d amount of BUSD, DAI or USDT over time and the loan will of course be given in DAI and will have to be paid in DAI. The volume of entrepreneurship in LATAM has increased and the number of people requesting loans in dollars is increasing, and nothing better than being a lender to verified users of Binance and that Binance is the custodian of resolving those loans. With this, greater organic volume and greater knowledge of \u201cDAI helps citizens\u201d ",
