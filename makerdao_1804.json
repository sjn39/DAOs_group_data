MKR token is here to heal system debt, vaults that got liquidated above the liquidation threshold did not cause system debt and should not be covered by MKR token holders. At least that was my understanding when coming on board (read: purchased MKR). Where would it stop then? Will MKR holders then become insurance providers for all sorts of Maker related incidents? Why is no one, I repeat, not one person, arguing that, if the community decides for some kind of compensation scenario, that the Maker Foundation pays that?

See below for details:   gist.github.com   https://gist.github.com/OperationNine/cdae6635f14e89b16ae0632366d48770 Vault 2288 damage report as a result of 0 bid exploit.md Firstly - thank you for acknowleding my post.  Here is the link to my CDP Vault 2288:  https://defiexplore.com/cdp/2288  After seeing the 0 bid liquidations I realised I had to exit my CDP as the system was under failure.  The long story short is this. The events of the 0 bid liquidations caused me to have to ACT fast in order to avoid being liquidated to 0. I was even told in MakerDAO chat on the day as it was happening. \"Do not get liquidated.\"   This file has been truncated. show original        Again I say this because if say Vault#XXXX gets back what they should have under a set of liquidation parameters - Example: Work out the ETH-USD price that is used to compensate vaults in a certain time period. eg)  100 USD for 1 ETH + 13 % penalty 90 USD for 1 ETH + 13% penalty 80 \u2026 etc  Then those same liquidation parameters should be in fairness applied to those also effected so that everyone gets the same level of outcome.

You were able to learn how to run a keeper in order to liquidate your own vault at a favourable rate. The fact that you didn\u2019t is your mistake, not ours.   Maker was not expecting users to run keeper bots, no where on any page is it explained when taking out a cdp. If you were expecting why its it mentioned on Oasis when taking out a cdp?     psychonaut:  You were liquidated, and directly caused the Maker Protocol to lose money because you failed to keep a safe-enough collateralization ratio. This is intrinsically negative (hence why there is a liquidation penalty). When you opened a Vault you \u2018agreed\u2019 to keep it collateralized. You broke that agreement, so why should we compensate you?   My ratio was always in green or orange. I did agree to keep it collateralised and maker agreed to take my eth plus 13% to pay back my loan not all my eth.     psychonaut:  It\u2019s your responsibility to understand the tools you use, the fact that you did not understand that 13% was the penalty after liquidation (which can return less than 150%) is your mistake, not ours.   No one is complaining about the 13%.    Compensating vault holders that liquidated at 0 bid?!   In the case of high network utilisation, users just need to set a higher gas price to get transactions through promptly, the responsibility for knowing how to use ethereum during times of high network congestion is also on you.   No one is complaining about this.    Compensating vault holders that liquidated at 0 bid?!   By compensating Vault users now, we set a precedent where we will compensate vault users in the future, this could undermine the game theoretical mechanisms underpinning the protocol.   Yes, it will force Maker not to make such mistakes in the future and take some responsibility in the way you market your products going forward. Again, as i said before the question should be how to compensate not if. Non of these points are valid or fair. ",

The keeper bot code is open-source, as is the contract code. You were able to learn how to run a keeper in order to liquidate your own vault at a favourable rate. The fact that you didn\u2019t is your mistake, not ours. You were liquidated, and directly caused the Maker Protocol to lose money because you failed to keep a safe-enough collateralization ratio. This is intrinsically negative (hence why there is a liquidation penalty). When you opened a Vault you \u2018agreed\u2019 to keep it collateralized. You broke that agreement, so why should we compensate you? It\u2019s your responsibility to understand the tools you use, the fact that you did not understand that 13% was the penalty after liquidation (which can return less than 150%) is your mistake, not ours. In the case of high network utilisation, users just need to set a higher gas price to get transactions through promptly, the responsibility for knowing how to use ethereum during times of high network congestion is also on you. By compensating Vault users now, we set a precedent where we will compensate vault users in the future, this could undermine the game theoretical mechanisms underpinning the protocol.    My number one piece of feedback is that the overall tone is a bit combative. It might be better to use language with a little less implied bias. Most important thing I would suggest would be to avoid us vs them language wherever possible. Just looking at this point:     psychonaut:  You were liquidated, and directly caused the Maker Protocol to lose money because you failed to keep a safe-enough collateralization ratio. This is intrinsically negative (hence why there is a liquidation penalty). When you opened a Vault you \u2018agreed\u2019 to keep it collateralized. You broke that agreement, so why should we compensate you?   I think you could probably reword that as something to the effect of: \u201cVaults were liquidated because they failed to meet the collateralization requirements of the protocol. By opening a vault users implicitly agreed to maintain an adequate collateralization ratio.\u201d I think that gets the point across without all the finger pointing. There are several points in the \u201carguments against\u201d section about not adequately understanding the risk of the system. Not sure they need to be called out separately. See:     psychonaut:  It\u2019s your responsibility to understand the tools you use, the fact that you did not understand that 13% was the penalty after liquidation (which can return less than 150%) is your mistake, not ours.       psychonaut:  This is crypto, all the information as to how the liquidations took place is available on-chain in the form of smart-contract code, due to this, you had the opportunity to be fully informed as to how it works, the fact that you were not is your mistake, not ours.       psychonaut:  In the case of high network utilisation, users just need to set a higher gas price to get transactions through promptly, the responsibility for knowing how to use ethereum during times of high network congestion is also on you.   I think all of those arguments ultimately distill down to vault users are expected to understand the ethereum ecosystem. You could probably say something like: \u201cVault users are expected to understand the ethereum ecosystem and accept the liabilities associated with using that system. All contract code is open sourced and available to be audited. As such, by using the protocol it is understood that the users are adequately informed and accept the risk of their actions.\u201d Also:     psychonaut:  The estimate shall be backed up by a written report and Monte Carlo simulation.   For this idk that we need to be that explicit. If and when analysis is done we can figure out some way to ratify it\u2019s findings ",

Do I understand correctly?   Primo\u017e\u2019s numbers assume keepers paying near oracle prices which is unreasonable during market crash (he was not calculating compensation numbers, just profits/loses by ecosystem actors AFTER the event) At one point price went from 170$ to 140$ in less than an hour.  Rational keepers would bid very conservatively in such environment. They would need to sell eth very quickly (pay high gas fees, find best market etc\u2026). All this would need to be coded in advance (detection of market crash, strategy during market crash, etc\u2026). It\u2019s the nature of eth collateral not having some \u2018fundamental value\u2019 that complicates things for keepers. If i would code my keeper, i would immediately shutdown (or go to special mode) in such conditions, send notifications (possibly to wake me up).  It is huge risk/reward situation for keepers. ",

You guys should not be complaining at people that are working to get this issue resolved.     Sandhaai:  If this is about fairness & governance in the interest of Maker surely we can\u2019t have the guy drafting the poll be someone that says \u201c\u2026it\u2019s not our fault if people are dumb\u201d?!   And for the record, I was the one who originally wrote those arguments against compensation acting as devils advocate because people were claiming that there were no arguments against compensation. Since then, my position has actually evolved somewhat in that I feel we should compensate zero-bids up to the best-guess of what those auctions would have reached if keepers had had the liquidity they had for some of the other auctions. Given that most of the other auctions also closed at maybe 70% of the collateral value, that doesn\u2019t actually amount to much. Something that I think is essential to recognise is that Maker Governance is not responsible for creating UI or enforcing which UI\u2019s can be used to interact with the protocol, and as such, we are not responsible for what any given UI does or does not say about liquidations. This whole \u2018I expected 13% thing\u2019 isn\u2019t on governance, it\u2019s on the makers of those UIs (if it\u2019s on anyone, which arguably it isn\u2019t.) ",

Poll 1: Should we compensate Vault Holders to any degree (the specifics of which to be determined later)? Yes No Poll 2: Should any compensation be denominated in Dai or the collateral asset that was liquidated? Dai Collateral Asset in question Then, later, we can create a third poll to determine the amount to be compensated, and which assumptions we are using to generate that amount.

                    "content": "    LongForWisdom:  You guys should not be complaining at people that are working to get this issue resolved   Point taken. Apologies @psychonaut  for my tone - I\u2019m probably too invested in this issue to be objective. I will try to limit my contribution to where I think I can add value and that is as an average (crypto-capable) user.     psychonaut:  I\u2019ve done leveraged trading before and lost a lot of money. I\u2019ve been in your shoes.   I appreciate that, and yes these shoes suck, but the issue at hand is not about the effect of leveraged trading. I think all concerned respect the risks taken and losses suffered due to leveraging.     psychonaut:  I think the case for compensation is already strong enough. What specific points do you have in mind?   For me, and from what I read on the other discussions, it misses out on the core question: Who are your users? Who do you want them to be? Two options > A: Users are very technically capable understanding the mechanics of Ethereum/auditing code and such. Well then you really need to limit your activities to a very small group of users and state clearly on all communication that this is a specialist product for coders. As a user I can honestly say I really did not get this impression from interacting with the ecosystem. B: The aim is mass adoption. Users are crypto-savvy probably, but you don\u2019t expect them to be able to audit code. In this scenario you \u201cas Maker\u201d need to take on a lot of the non-obvious risk that\u2019s in the system and compensate users for those. You can\u2019t take the luxury of hiding behind the small print and open-source code. If you want the benefit of mass-adoption (Maker price going up etc) you need to also take on the down-side of this option. You can\u2019t have both. You can\u2019t be ethical, give your users a fair shake and have the benefits of both - then you\u2019re just another ICO-type project if you get what I mean. These new systems need a degree of ethics to succeed. The thousands of ICO projects of 2017 can also say \u201cyou should have known the risks\u201d and they\u2019re right - if you invested in them you were an idiot and deserve to be burnt, but isn\u2019t what you\u2019re trying to do different from that? Do you want to tell your users that if they get burnt by your platform they\u2019re stupid and they should have known the risks? There\u2019s something wrong about not protecting users and hiding behind technicalities or a collective. If I were in your shoes I\u2019d want to avoid that perception.You want to be decentralised, but be in the pioneering boat with your users because they are taking enough platform risk anyway and if this thing works out you both will do well.

I.e. where will the Dai/ETH/BAT come from? Who will custody it?    \u201cTo analyze the data, approx 2000 DAI (a week of analyst time) shall be requisioned.\u201d  How was this number arrived at? Where will these funds come from?    \u201cVault holder compensation will be paid for with additional flop auctions. Once money is available, the assets will be put into a contract that vault holders can withdraw from.\u201d  Where is this contract coming from? Who will own it? Will it be audited?    \u201cTo withdraw, vault holders will need to browse to a web page\u2026\u201d  Who will make and host this page?    \u201c\u2026where they agree to indemnify Maker and affiliates against any potential legal claims for their loss.\u201d  What team has validated the legalities of an indemnity clause? For what jurisdictions could it be valid?    \u201cThe assets will be available for vault holders to claim for 30 days.\u201d  Why 30 days?    There is a significant amount of mildly hand-wavy solutions baked into in this poll which will require numerous stakeholders to align on; both inside and outside the Foundation. I\u2019m not convinced that it\u2019s possible to guess at the actual on-chain implementation right now\u2026 Ultimately isn\u2019t this poll only intended to determine if the intention to compensate is shared?

This could negatively impact reputation and future mass adoption.\u201d I\u2019ll leave it to you to edit that statement if needed and consider the spirit of the argument as a whole in the poll since I\u2019m not that confident in my wording. Just fyi this passage in N. Taleb\u2019s book \u201cSkin in the game\u201d summarizes the principle involved better than I can: \"Second, it is about the distortions of symmetry and reciprocity in life: If you have the rewards, you must also get some of the risks, not let others pay the price of your mistakes. If you inflict risk on others, and they are harmed, you need to pay some price for it. Just as you should treat others in the way you\u2019d like to be treated,  you  would  like  to  share  the  responsibility  for  events without unfairness and inequity. If you give an opinion, and someone follows it, you are morally obligated to be, yourself, exposed to its consequences.

Typically, you will receive back about 24% of the ETH you have deposited in case of liquidation.  However, in some cases, you may receive zero ETH back depending on market conditions at the time of the auction\u201d. Does this need to be covered in another poll (i.e. Should stronger warnings about the risks of collateral loss be placed on Oasis?) Or can we include this here as one of the action items.  Thanks ",

I understand that Oasis is now a separate \u201ccompany\u201d under Maker Ecosystem Growth Holdings, but it is also the go-to place recommended by the Maker community (and has roots in Oasis Dex, which was created by the foundation). I would venture to guess that the vast majority of people casually using the Maker system did not know about these details. To most people, it looks like there\u2019s just one Maker, and Oasis is part of its suite of products. Perhaps not using the name Oasis after the switch would have alerted more people to the fact that it\u2019s no longer the \u201cresponsibility\u201d of Maker. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the community (i.e. MKR holders) has at least some degree of responsibility here. And just a disclaimer, I might be wrong here since I haven\u2019t had time to follow every little business decision the Maker foundation has decided to enact. ",

To most people, it looks like there\u2019s just one Maker\u2026   I completely agree, and I know how it looks. Unfortunately that doesn\u2019t change the fact that \u2018Maker\u2019 is made up of lots of parts. The Maker Foundation, MakerDAO (which doesn\u2019t have a good definition), MKR Token Holders, etc. I am not arguing that Oasis is not the responsibility of the Maker Foundation (regardless of whatever the company structure looks like for that.) I am arguing that Oasis and other UIs aren\u2019t the responsibility of MKR Token Holders (who are the people who will be paying for the compensation). There was never a vote to create the Oasis UI, MKR Token Holders have no input into its operation, we don\u2019t fund it. The same is true of the DefiSaver UI which shows the same 13% liquidation penalty. At best we can vote to say \u2018Oasis (or UI\u2019s generally) should do this\u2019 and hope that they do what we asked them to. So I would disagree strongly that MKR Holders have responsibility for Oasis or any other UI. What MKR Token Holders do have responsibility for is the auction parameter settings that were active during Black Thursday which turned out to be inadequate, and there is an argument that this was predictable beforehand to some extent. If we do end up compensating Vault Holders, my hope is that it will be made clear why (though I know people have different opinions, and therefore in all likelihood this will remain muddy). As to the Maker Community recommending certain UI\u2019s there is perhaps some level of responsibility there, but it\u2019s probably not correct to equate the community directly to MKR Token Holders.

In an ideal world I think many people would agree that the Maker Foundation should just fork over the money to compensate vault holders. MKR token holders however need a way to exert pressure upon the Maker Foundation because the decisions they are making have serious effects on the public\u2019s trust of the system which in turn can be detrimental to MKR token holders. However, there is currently no way for MKR token holders to force the foundation to do anything and I think this is where there is a potential issue of moral hazard. I\u2019m not saying that MKR tokens should be able to force the Foundation to fork over money, but there\u2019s certainly a mismatch of consequence and power here. And to bring the point home, regardless of who\u2019s fault it is, if people think the system feels \u201cunfair\u201d then it\u2019s going to be detrimental to MKR token holders AND the Maker Foundation in the long run. I say this as a significant holder of MKR and someone who also lost their vault. ",

Arguments for compensation in DAI (the DAI value of the residual collateral at the time of liquidation):  Not sure why the option to compensate \u201cthe DAI value of the residual collateral at the time of liquidation\u201d has ever popped. What the compensation is about? If it\u2019s about returning the lost collateral assets then this option is unfair. Why to use the collateral-to-DAI price at the time of liquidation? Why not use a price an asset was bought at or a price at the time when it was put to vault? Equally unreasonable any arbitrary time point is just meaningless without a time machine so anyone can buy back their collateral. Sure there\u2019s a technical challenge to give a fair price to collateral assets at the time flop auctions will take place but that\u2019s a minor thing as it can be largely mitigated by setting a price point the day/hour before auctions start. If the spirit of compensation is more like a moral compensation then this approach is ok. However it\u2019s unreasonable to speak of any additional haircut to payouts in this context. And also there\u2019s another drawback as this desincentivize Maker holders to resolve this issue ASAP (the longer it takes the better is MKR/DAI ratio). My proposal is to have two DAI options in the poll:  moral compensation with DAI proportional to lost collateral (ratio to be decided in a subsequent poll) compensation of lost collateral with DAI (due to its technical simplicity, haircut to be decided in a subsequent poll)  With this options I think it\u2019s not necessary anymore to include an option to compensate vault holders with a liquidated asset.

In summary: I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea to add this to the portal without some review of the signalling guidelines, seeing some more evidence that there\u2019s been adequate discussion with the relevant stakeholders, and having clear signs that community consensus has been reached on the content of the poll. I\u2019m going to run through a pile of stuff, please forgive the point form. Procedural Concerns   This thread is getting extremely unwieldy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very likely people are going to be able to come into this cold and understand what is going on here. Section 3 of the Guidelines addresses this issue: \u201cThe topic should seek to gather signals for only a single issue. If you want multiple signals, make multiple topics.\u201d This is particularly important because the ecosystem needs a clear audit trail, a historical record, of the decision making that went into a change to the system. Especially in light of the tremendous amount of crypto press interest generated from the last compensation poll    Can we have a lock-down, or code freeze period here? The process in the other signal threads has generally been at least a few days beginning after the forum poll has ended; the proposer summarises the discussion and then it sits long enough for people to have enough time to find the proposal (people are busy) and express last-minute contention.   This proposal has also been altered in other venues after the debate here slowed down. If the content of the poll changes after the debate winds down it\u2019s hard to assert that the community has actually agreed on a specific course of action.   Do we need the summaries of the arguments in the body of the poll? Is it possible to do that in a way that accurately reflects everyone\u2019s thinking?   If not, doesn\u2019t this addition imply that someone is editorialising? Can a few users encapsulate the arguments from all the people in the thread, and the ecosystem, without unintentionally introducing bias?   Can\u2019t voters be referred back to the thread for summary review and leave the polling to clear decision making processes?     Consensus Concerns   The convention around all previous polls from the community has required an in-forum poll to gauge sentiment, this new poll does not have one. As per the guidelines: \"Polling Results should be made visible after a vote has been cast. \u2018Show who voted\u2019 should be enabled.\"   Can we keep the conversation in the forums so the less technical can remain engaged? I had no idea there are debates and edits going on in GitHub. Some of them are fairly significant, and recent, developments.   Planning and Feasibility Concerns I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m following the chain of events are here. The first poll was to determine if there is an appetite for compensation. Why is the second step to determine the denomination? Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to get the community aligned on a plan, map it out into a roadmap, then figure out which parts need to be put into the polling system? This feels a bit like it\u2019s being invented week to week. I\u2019m not sure there will be any resolution to this issue without a plan that involves the stakeholders and some discovery about who will do what, when. In the absence of, or until one arises, I would really like to avoid any mention of specific mechanics. This poll is still getting deeply into the territory of making assumptions about feasibility. There are an unbelievable amount of complexities hidden in these guesses at solutions. The community may find out that some of those implementations are not possible. What happens when voters get upset that what they signalled for isn\u2019t the same things as what actually happened? For example, in this poll it\u2019s not clear who is going to custody these funds or how the transactions will take place. Also: \u201cTo provide compensation, Maker would have to purchase this ETH at the current market rate\u201d. Depending on how this is read it can have very different implications. Who is Maker in this context? Summary In light of this lack of established norms I\u2019m going to recommend the community and the proposers address the missing process and consensus issues here before I add this to the portal. I am, as always, very reluctant to exercise any of the IGF mandate\u2019s powers but this is an extremely sensitive issue with a wide number of stakeholders, lots of moving parts, and countless possible implementation plans. And, as the community seems to have signalled their intention to move ahead with compensation, I don\u2019t believe a further review of this proposal will materially delay any eventual outcomes. Community, let me know your thoughts. ",
