The amount of stEth purchased is dependent on the size of the surplus buffer, yet nowhere in MIPs is the value of the surplus buffer actually defined or are any CU empowered to define it. Existing documentation takes for granted that MakerDAO is holding liquid on-chain assets. With investments into treasuries and bonds, assets whose values can vary based on market conditions, this calculation is not as simple as it has historically been. For MIP84, it will be important that we have a clear method for defining the number. The protocol will need a way to mark bonds to market value(possibly a CU empowered to do so) and factor this into buffer calculations. ",

                    "content": "The value of the Surplus Buffer is actually quite defined, it\u2019s on-chain for all to see. The question is more to know if this value is a fair representation of reality? Answer is yes and no. No, it\u2019s not accurate. We have USDC-A that stayed wrong for months now. 6S vault is accruing fictious interest. It also doesn\u2019t count the DAI in the core unit wallets or the assets in the DSPauseProxy. On the reverse, on could argue that vested DAI in the DSSVest for CU shouldn\u2019t be considered in regard of the surplus buffer. Overall, I would say that it\u2019s still a good enough representation. Getting a more precise number, whatever that means, wouldn\u2019t change the whole picture. As discussed already, IMO, the SB is too small compared to the amount of risk MakerDAO seems willing to take. Moreover, provider a SB calculation off-chain is unlikely to simplify things as it would create to sources of truth. SF is nevertheless working on this path as well for instance with the MIP65 Tracker. Providing better technical solution is the path, but will not be fixed in a year. The PSM with oracle discussed in the case of Backed finance is one step in this direction. For RWA, the easiest fix is to repay what we considered fake debt from RWA vault by sucking from the SB. This should be done if we see a big discrepancy on RWAs like MIP65. So far it\u2019s $700k max (as the dashboard don\u2019t track the expense account). Should it be more than $5M we could do something. The problem will also be more located in the ETH hold by the POVE structure. I proposed an easy to fix this one, but there was no community support.
