We know that Terra recently acquired 200 million worth of its AVAX token. But as we pointed out in their Bridge Contract https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f?a=0xe78388b4ce79068e89bf8aa7f218ef6b9ab0e9d0 https://etherscan.io/address/0xe78388b4ce79068e89bf8aa7f218ef6b9ab0e9d0 they have more than 800 Million DAI. It would be interesting to see an approach, to allow it to be a type of collateral, indirectly they are betting on the lower risk for the growth of these EVMs. In the case of Matic and possibly GNO (formerly xDAI), if all goes well, I would like to see Maker take on this type of guarantee for large EVMs such as Fantom, Avax, Matic, GNO, Osmosis, Harmony or KLAY. Obviously, following the parameters that need to be followed to achieve this. ",
