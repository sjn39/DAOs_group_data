Yes Optimism native?: The protocol is deployed on Optimism. Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: The protocol deployed on Optimism around Jan of 2023. Ecosystem Value Proposition:  What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?  Optimism Mint solves Scalability: It makes it easy and cheap to deploy NFTs contract removing the middleman thats making NFTs Minting on Optimism Decentralized.
