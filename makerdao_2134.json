Paragraph Summary The Amendment and Removal Process-MIP outlines the process for arbitrary changes to MIPs, and removal of MIPs. It is empowered to make the changes that are required for the Maker Constitution to be properly integrated into Maker Governance.  Component Summary MIP102c1: Purpose Description Suggests the purpose of the amendment and removal processes and possible reasons for using each process. MIP102c2: Amendment Process for MIPs A process component which defines a method and template for the amendment of an accepted MIP.

This MIP provides the necessary rules to enable arbitrary changes to existing MIPs in order to make them compatible with the Maker Constitution.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP102c1: Purpose Description  Amendments MIP Amendments that preserve the MIP number can be performed to modify any aspect of an existing MIP, including MIP0. There are no restrictions on how an existing MIP can be amended. Multiple amendments to multiple MIPs are allowed to be submitted as a single subproposal.  Removals MIP102 also enables the removal of one or multiple MIPs that are inactive as a part of the Endgame transition. Multiple MIPs may be removed in a single MIP Removal subproposal.  MIP102c2: Amendment Process for MIPs MIP102c2 is a Process MIP component that regulates the amendment of one or multiple Accepted MIPs. MIP102c2 subproposals have the following parameters:   Default Feedback Period: 1 month  Frozen Period: 1 week  Governance Cycle: Monthly  Other Requirements: None.  All MIP102c2 subproposals must use the template located at MIP102c2-Subproposal-Template.md.  MIP102c3: MIP Removal Process MIP102c3 is a Process MIP component that allows the removal of one or multiple Accepted MIPs. MIP102c3 subproposals have the following parameters:   Default Feedback Period: 1 month  Frozen Period: 1 week  Governance Cycle: Monthly  Other Requirements: None.

I can see a world in which we want to focus on one specific scope intensely for a month, as an example. In this situation allowing amendments each week might be worthwhile. Additionally, we were planning on potentially using the weekly amendment process for the DLO MIPs, as it would have allowed us to make some changes before they were used, but still allow them to be voted on in the February cycle. In the end, they were delayed until March which made the above unnecessary. All that said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s critical to keep the weekly-amendment ability, so not a hill I\u2019m going to die on. ",
