Would be happy with black or red or green for the wallet ring. ",

People can set preferences and \u201cwatch\u201d a category in their email preferences but that\u2019s not really the same thing as being a member. There IS a groups ability, too, but that would mean Ring Makers have to actively manage group membership. We may want to do that to show Wallet Ring members, AND you can @-mention groups which notifies all the users. This probably needs a tracking Github issue if we want to go this direction. Yes, colours are possible. ",
