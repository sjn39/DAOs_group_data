I think the protocol might figure out how many DAI transfer txs are there in total, so to then figure out what percentage of the fees it can pay for each user. That the tx fees be cheaper for sending DAI than sending other tokens, would increase DAI popularity in my opinion. ",

It\u2019s a project to follow, I think.
