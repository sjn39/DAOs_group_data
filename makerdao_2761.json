                    "content": "Working on real world asset you quickly find yourself with legal contracts and KYC. Currently, MakerDAO and most DAO are dodging the issue. We have ways to continue to dodge it with RWA (by using Maker representatives for instance). We don\u2019t have a legal team yet, but that shouldn\u2019t stop us from thinking. In my understanding a DAO is a general partnership where MIPs and MKR tokens are the agreement and this forum a proof of existence. Each country has its own legal framework and \u201cis a DAO a legal entity?\u201d remains unknown. In any case, a general partnership has unlimited liabilities, so you don\u2019t want to have any responsibility or liability at MakerDAO level. While launching a smart contract protocol can be said to be non legally binding, it\u2019s still a gray area). Not having legal contract make it uneasy to exercice collateral rights on RWA liquidation (as the collateral is not in the vault). Currently, the solution is to use a Maker Representative which is more a bandaid than a good solution and/or a Foundation. A better solution might be to have a limited liability subsidiary to manage real world stuff. What are your opinions on those subjects? Do you have links to documentation (previous court cases with a DAO, other DAO having real world business, \u2026)? Resources:  https://daotalk.org/t/resource-list-dao-legal/533  ",

                    "content": "I pushed some extra hours researching this subject. The field is still early.  TheDAO did incorporate a LLC in Switzerland to conduct business. TheDAO crashed soon after so not much to be learnt here. OpenLaw provide services to set a DAO as a LLC. But it\u2019s not very relevant here as you need accredited investors and probably KYC.  dOrg did something similar to have a limited liability DAO. I left the security issue out because there is no solution for that. Jurisprudence shows that it\u2019s not that costly (EOS owners had to pay $24M for a 4B issuance). Taxation will probably be a concern as well. In some/most jurisdictions you might have to declare DAI earned in the surplus buffer as taxable income. No one want to do that I guess.   The why of a legal structure ?   Protect MKR holders and workers. Both from early taxation and legal liability. Black Thursday shows that the lack of a limited liability entity move any issue to MKR holders. The Maker Foundation is shielding other MKR holder for now (too big and too easy to attack). In the future, I guess mandated actors will be the first line. They will have a hard time to prove that they were just contractors without any form of contract.   Enforce our rights. If we lend 1M DAI to anyone without collateral control, he can walk away without much fear. We argue that we are, in fact, a general partnership and send someone to represent Maker (not to be confused with the Maker Representative) as a partner. But this very person will therefore be the target of the point 1.    The Maker Representative, coinvestors and trusts There is 3 ways currently to solve this issue and enforce our rights without acting too much like a legal entity.   The Maker Representative: Thanks to @mrabino1 the idea is to have someone outside of Maker to defend Maker interests using it\u2019s own legal stature. My thinking makes me feel that the representative shouldn\u2019t own any MKR token and don\u2019t be participating in governance or he would be an easy target.   The coinvestor: Quite similar to the Maker Representative, the coinvestors is just some that will defend its own interests that will help us as well. For instance, if Circle start stopping USDC conversion, we might expect people to sue them over breach of contract. That will help us as well.   The trust: We might set up a trust with rules that go in our benefits even without having any link with it. Think of the DAI Foundation.   Those options are great to get thing rolling, but they don\u2019t make me feel comfortable. Moreover, they don\u2019t protect MKR holders and workers from litigation. I\u2019m not talking about something hypothetical here. It happened and will happen again.     iammeeoh:  Uneasy or impossible?   I would say uneasy (but okay) at start, impossible at scale. But I start the discussion to have more feedback and ideas. I touched the subject on the [Discussion] MakerDAO in 5 years thread. If we want Maker to be independent and powerful in 5 years (something with a 10-100B market cap), this has to be solved or this will blow up in one way or another. ",

                    "content": "In my eyes, a Trust managed by a regulated well established Trustee is the best angle for scale. Structured Asset Backed transactions have been using Trusts for decades. Nothing new here. The novel approach here is to both grant MakerDAO governance levers to control the LendCo <-> Trust agreement (the credit agreement) and when to liquidate the vault. That said, the community needs to have oversight over the LendCo activities. It really shouldnt just be one Maker Representative. The community should advocate for many.     SebVentures:  My thinking makes me feel that the representative shouldn\u2019t own any MKR token and don\u2019t be participating in governance or he would be an easy target.   For this, it doesnt matter if that one Maker Rep has 1 MKR or 100. I dont really understand how anyone would be a \u201ctarget\u201d (or what that means). MKR Governance always retains the right to add new Maker Reps or just remove or replace them. So, in the scenario that an individual is compromised (e.g. kidnapped or bribed or deemed \u201cdirty\u201d, (s)he / they can be replaced with one vote).     SebVentures:  Those options are great to get thing rolling, but they don\u2019t make me feel comfortable. Moreover, they don\u2019t protect MKR holders and workers from litigation. I\u2019m not talking about something hypothetical here. It happened  and will happen again.   As for attempting to remove all aspects of litigation, not going to happen. The real world is a litigious animal. The question is not how to avoid litigation, it is how can attack vectors be minimized and positioning the structure and the parties to win. There is no way to be immune to litigation and live in a civilized world. For real world asset transactions where capital is deployed from MKR, this is no different. The best protection from any litigation is long standing jurisprudence and an efficient Court of Law while being compliant with Law. For a Trust with a regulated Trust Company (Trustee) as a fiduciary, a Trust Company will only serve in that capacity after they get an enforceability opinion for the Trust Agreement and all operative documents. Their entire business model derives from being compliant with the Law. Further, they have a fiduciary obligation to protect the Trust. They will retain external counsel if the Trust is drawn into litigation. With regard to the Maker Rep, as outlined above, it is an administrative role with the primary responsibility of being a proxy of confidential information to the public. This is a trusted role but one that the Maker Rep can easily resign or be replaced. Even if this partied was drawn into litigation, this should be an indemnified role. The objective of this role is to tell the truth and be honest in his / her assessment of {insert whatever he / she is looking at}. The only true risk this role has is when the party is dishonest and damage is caused. ",

Quite possible. This is also true for both of us just having our names on this forum or participating in Maker Governance itself. No one can stop litigation in a civilized society. No doubt it can be make life annoying. Having retained counsel to fight litigation, I can say it is no fun. For certain any party that gets pulled into litigation will also file counterclaims. Therein lies the Maker Reps true defense. He / she is just a proxy to share information and not MakerDAO. The counterclaims that would be filed to sue a rep would / should exceed that of the original claim. Frivolous litigation is well\u2026 Annoying to say the least. Is there a way to structure thing to completely remove this? Put simply. No.     SebVentures:  If MakerDAO is seen as a general partnership, any partner can have unlimited liabilities on any action by MakerDAO.   While I am not an attorney, being a part of general partnership (if that is what a DAO is ultimately deemed which is questionable) might make an individual responsible for his / her part of the liabilities, but not all of them.

I think what\u2019s ultimately needed is some kind of joint venture among all/many of the DeFi active governance protocols to fund an entity that provides governance execution (and a measure of industry self-regulation) as a service. That entity could, in effect, be paid to take on a lot of the risks that DAO members would otherwise face as general partners. It could obtain insurance, or use self-insurance, to fund recoveries. Responsibility/liability is inevitable and this seems like the best way to get ahead of it.

You can imagine the smaller the MKR holders, the less interesting the return per claim. This is the difference between \u201cThe Law\u201d and \u201cThe business of the Law\u201d.   No, it\u2019s the exact opposite. A general partnership imposes unlimited joint and several liability\u2013that\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s so much worse than having a gov\u2019t-sanctioned entity (which provides limited liability).

You can sue JP Morgan Chase as you want, the JP Morgan Chase shareholder will not really care. They have limited liability so in the worse case they lose their investment. They don\u2019t go bankrupt or in jail. On the other side, if you suggest an emergency signal request and vote the executive that lead to breaching a somewhat non formalized contract with a borrower, this borrower might want to sue you. Would that lead to something? I\u2019m not a lawyer and I hope not, but you would prefer to be a JP Morgan shareholder at this point. One may argue that we are more like a private bank. I\u2019m quite sure the Medici were quite decentralized due to the lack of communication technology of their era. The limited liability is one of the most powerful innovation in the world. ",
