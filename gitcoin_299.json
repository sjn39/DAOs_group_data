Vibes is one of the reasons many of us stick around between grant rounds and stay active on the social platforms. Two areas this can benefit the space is using Public Goods as a tool for onboarding when traditional routes aren\u2019t feasible - see #ImpactOnboarding and empowering the buidlers in LatAm to buidl OSS, Eth Infra and DeSci. Gitcoin can benefit from this by accelerating the use of Gitcoin passport and onboarding communities listed below to Grants Protocol. Industry Analysis Communities:   EthLatAm (Now Eth KIPU) - Community leaders (myself included) coordinating to promote ETH education, infra, and Public Goods throughout the region.

We have many non English speaking budliers and public goodoooors in LatAm who are unable to break into the industry. I\u2019m hoping \u201cGitcoin fixes this\u201d. I\u2019m seeking feedback from other community members, especially spanish speakers. Do you participate in any other communities in multiple languages? How can this be copy pasta\u2019d in other regions - like India, or Arabic speaking countries? Should we send it? ",

Most of the news my family and friends find about crypto are related to trading, frauds, or influencers talking non-sense. We need value-aligned media that spreads the Gitcoin message into Portu\u00f1ol! -that\u2019s the Portuguese and Spanish convo that any Latino is able to understand no matter if they only speak one of both languages. And that my frens, AI can\u2019t do, at least not yet. If there\u2019s budget or support from Gitcoin to a Portu\u00f1ol working group that translates all media to this mixed language it will help bring many people onboard, spreading the values of the gift economy, and of solarpunk / lunarpunk ways of living.
