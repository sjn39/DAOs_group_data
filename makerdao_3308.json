                    "content": " Overview In the executive passed on January 25, the USDC-PSM was configured for slowly lerping to 500 MM over 12 weeks (~1/3 of it passed by now). A good portion of the DAI-from-USDC has been sucked up by it, about 130 MM DAI has been generated from it already  While the PSM has already generated >100k DAI in fees since it got deployed, we do not make any fees by the USDC-A vaults as we have the stability fee at 0%. I think it is about time to make the next step.  Increase PSM-DC and set Debt Ceiling for USDC-A/B to 0 I want to propose that - as we now know that the PSM got adopted (e.g. 1inch has it) - we should  set the DC for USDC-A and USDC-B to 0 stop the lerp to 500M and instead set a new debt ceiling for PSM-USDC  I am aware that there was already a Signal about setting the DC to 0 and there is already a onchain-poll following that - but I have doubts that it passes (and even if it does, it does not conflict with this Signal). If we follow this proposal, we can later think about PSM flip all the existing USDC-vaults to the PSM - but this is future talk and not subject of this Signal Request. Pros:  we generate some fees again  Cons:  USDC-arbitrageurs are forced to use the PSM and cannot mint free DAI   Support for this idea? Please signal if you like this idea or not     Yes - good idea, let\u2019s do it No - bad idea or bad timing Abstain     0 voters      How high should we set the new DC for PSM-USDC? I added some options higher than the current state. Right now we have ~450MM DAI-from-USDC, with a DC of ~750MM - might be a good moment to adjust to the current situation  Please vote for all options you would support in an onchain poll     2000 MM (+1500 MM) 1500 MM (+1000 MM) 1000 MM (+500 MM) 750 MM  (+250 MM) 500 MM (current setting after final lerp) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Poll will run until 2021-03-04T14:00:00Z; its outcome will  result in a on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary.

It doesn\u2019t increase risks dramatically more since 500m is already a number that could break Maker if something goes terribly wrong with USDC. Considering USDC-A vaults get migrated to PSM-USDC-A (336m) and current utilization of PSM at 182m we might want a higher debt ceiling than 500m. Also, we may want a 20% of DAI debt to be available in mints from stablecoins in DAI liquidity crunch events. This tells me 1bn is a more reasonable number for PSM-USDC-A currently. ",

Please correct me if I am wrong:  The USDC in the PSM is property of MakerDAO. The USDC in a USDC-Vault is property of the user.  So, sure, a regulator could target both types, but they\u2019d have to target two different entities. If MakerDAO was to become \u201cundesired\u201d to the US regulators, for example, it would just take a \u201cPSM blacklist push-button\u201d to kill us. So I think it is of paramount importance to shift this risk somewhere else (like Uniswap). ",

                    "content": "Hi there, the urgency exec containing  setting PSM-USDC DC to 1B setting USDC-A DC to 0  will get executed tomorrow at 15:16 UTC. The only missing part of this Signal Request was to set the DC for USDC-B to 0 too. I have to admit I am not really convinced that this is a necessary step so I refrain from putting this to an onchain poll: USDC-B has a really high SF and a decent LR and we have  almost no utilization on it, so we are not missing out on any fees and are not putting us into any heavy risk for keeping it. USDC-B was initially meant as a last resort for keepers in case DAI-liquidity is totally down. I am quite sure it is not configured in a really appealing way, but setting DC to 0 is certainly not improving it. cheers, tim ",
