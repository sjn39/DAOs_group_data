                    "content": "This is the continuation of the TUSD offboarding process, which started in December 2020, when the community decided to lower the debt ceiling of TUSD-A to 0 which was followed with a recent signal request and an on-chain vote where the community decided to finalize the offboarding via liquidations. Currently there are 31 vaults remaining with aggregated 26.670m dai minted, collateralized by 26.516 TUSD, which means approximately 154k DAI in surplus buffer will be written off. Majority of positions are liquidatable at current time, (LR is at 101%), only two small dust positions are above, the increased LR will make sure everything is liquidatable. We are proposing the following parameter changes to TUSD-A which will safely liquidate current open positions which also considers users experience and protocol loss.  Enable liquidations Use Abacus/LinearDecrease \u2013 tau [seconds]  Set liquidation penalty to 0 Set liquidation ratio to 150% Set buf to 1 Set ilk.hole to 5m Set tau to 21,600,000 second (est. 10bps drop per 6 hours = 250 days till 0) Set tail to 432,000 second (5 days, implies minimum price of 0.98)  cusp not relevant, stays the same (tail will stop the auction) Set chip to 0 (no need to be fast) Set tip to 500 (bit higher value so that we guarantee kicking all vaults)  In the worst case scenario, where we reach the highest price discount allowed by the auction (tail), we create 530.3k DAI bad debt which in addition to the dai accrued in surplus buffer which will be written off. Additionally we will incur some costs related to tip, which amount to 15.5k DAI in total. Final worst case scenario thus amounts to 699.8k DAI which would be deducted from the surplus buffer. However, we expect the auctions to be settled before the maximum 2% discount is reached, especially for larger vaults, which means the loss from this offboarding event will be much lower. ",
