This threshold will increase to 2B USDP in 2024. The USDP PSM currently has $436M in USDP and a Maximum Debt Ceiling (MDC) of 450M which wouldn\u2019t provide any marketing incentive to MakerDAO. This poll provides the opportunity to the MakerDAO community to comment on the proposed partnership and parameters on the USDP PSM, by adding friction to any outflow of USDP (by setting the tout parameter to 20bps) and could increase the protocol\u2019s exposure to USDP by setting the MDC at 1,500M DAI. Paxos will be attending the community G&R call this upcoming week on Thursday, February 9th, and providing an overview of the proposed partnership and participate in Q&A. I would highly encourage the community to review the partnership post, linked above, and come prepared with questions for the Paxos team.  Proposed parameters changes for PSM-USDP-A: tin from 20bps to 0bps tout from 0bps to 20bps line from 450M to 1500M Those parameters could be altered if deemed too risky by a Risk Facilitator. Pros  Would generate up to 29.25M additional revenues Would diversify our fiat-backed stablecoin exposure (less USDC more USDP)  Cons  Will reduce intrablock liquidity reserves (20bps added friction) USDP is less liquid on-chain than USDC     Should MakerDAO change the PSM-USDP-A parameters as described above?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     ",
