You can check past updates here:  July June May   Highlights of the month  HVB Bank Video In August we released an AMAZING video about the HVB Bank integration, being as we know the first commercial loan participation between an U.S. Regulated Financial Institution and a Decentralized Digital Currency. This integration involves a 100 million DAI participation facility to support HVB growth, a Bank founded back in 1871,this application proposed a legal structure wherein Huntingdon Valley Bank enters into a Master Purchase Agreement with a trust for the benefit of MakerDAO. For further information will leave you the direct link to the Twitter announcement + video: HVB Video.   Pre-Merge comms As the merge was approaching people started to wonder about all the risks that the merge implies. With the help of the MakerDAO Twitter account we began a series of tweets to inform our community and people on Crypto Twitter how probably the merge would affect Maker Vaults and Dai users. Our first thread focused on the potential fork risks that could impact Maker, such as: Futures Backwardation & Negative Funding, stETH Discount and External Asset Fork Choice. Then in a second thread we did a little recap of the Risk Core Unit publication named \u201cMerge Risks and Market Impacts.\" The threads continued all over until September when we delivered our official communication towards The Merge and what should do Maker Vaults and Dai users in this event. We hope all our efforts helped everyone to make a good decision as The Merge was successful and all the Ethereum Community, including us, were really happy with this milestone.   Top 3 tweets with partners  Origin USD + DAI Now going with some BD + marketing actions, we share with our Audience the work being done with Origin Protocol and their stable OUSD, within the tweet we communicate how through its yield-capturing power, Origin is now backing 28 million OUSD with DAI \u2014 +58% of all its circulating supply. For further information here is the tweet.
