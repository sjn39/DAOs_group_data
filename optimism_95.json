                    "content": "Project Name : WardenSwap Author Name: Panas Number of OP tokens requested: 300,000 L2 Recipient Address: 0xc146a672c85b408a9a7bc00f74ad567b7684134c  Overview of WardenSwap: WardenSwap is the real-time best rate DEXes aggregator using AI Power to deliver the very best swap rates and lowest gas price from all markets in one place on wardenswap.finance. WardenSwap is proposing the idea of a sustainable ecosystem alongside the pillar of creating a strong community. WardenSwap launched MetaWarden, a NFT project which is aimed to boost the circular economy and community around the WardenSwap ecosystem. Furthermore, with 3 types of SDK for dApp developers to operate WardenSwap elsewhere. WardenSwap is live on Optimism, building on top of the concept of Data optimization method to pull out smaller data stored on Ethereum which causes lower gas cost by introducing compression techniques to make the Calldata smaller using \u201cAddress Table\u201d and \u201cData Serialization\u201d. ( WardenSwap 2.0 on Optimism)  Relevant Usage Metrics  Here are our metrics, all number is on the time of writing (17 June) Transaction Total Transaction: 1,113,100 tx Total Optimism Transaction: 11,097 tx (Since 19 April, 60 days) Volume Total trading volume: $4,276,184,771 (All Chains) Total Optimism volume: $3,392,877 (Since 19 April, 60 days) Unique address Total unique address: 70,119 addresses Unique address on Optimism: 2,293 addresses  Optimism alignment  WardenSwap hopes to encourage growth within the Optimism ecosystem by using subsidies, we hope to support the integrations and developments within L2. In addition, we want to sustainably boost Optimism and run with a good level of liquidity in order to migrate more of our activities to Optimism in the future.   WardenSwap will automatically locate the best swap rates and best gas across multiple pools for swappers on the Optimism network, providing them the best pricing. With the WardenSwap 2.0 Bloodstone upgrade, our splitting feature can split the trading volume to be as small as 1% in trading size in order to get a better price (the previous minimum trading size was 10%). This means the more it splits, the better price users will get   WardenSwap allows for community integrations by providing SDK which can freely integrate with WardenSwap by using our open-source (See gitbook for more information). 3 types of SDK we provided effortless and friendly to our community    Library For developers Customizable UI Kits that we ensure it is easy to implement Referral link program for both dApp and users These 3 SDK construct as another monetization strategy to earn the profit sharing from trading fees.   WardenSwap is supporting the Optimism ecosystem including NFT collection and product. We propose the use case of NFT on Optimism through a discount of trading fee. It is now shown that 40% of users on the Optimism chain in WardenSwap owned Optipunk.  To summarize: WardenSwap aims to build a community by providing both of the best trading experience for users on Optimism and adopt the ecosystem of Optimism at the same time.  Proposal for token distribution  How will the OP tokens be distributed? Currently, the following distribution will be proposed:  Builders (25%)   On top of WardenSwap, we have shown what can be done with our SDK tool for dApp developers, WardenSwap will create a thriving Optimism ecology and encourage the builders who successfully integrate WardenSwap in the Optimism ecosystem, with all support and a bonus plan depending on the metrics. Further by the Grants Program or Hackathon, WardenSwap aims to back up dApp developers to fund the project, selecting by community which is Optimism related. These are examples of our vision to dedicate ourselves for public goods that benefit the entire community and align with the Optimism ideal.  Traders (20%)   $OP will be incentive directly to the users of WardenSwap on Optimism as an opportunity to early adopter, active users, along with new users to increase the activity of trading in WardenSwap on Optimism. However, we believe that experience that traders will get from Optimism is absolutely valuable, and it will attract more activity on its own.  Referral Program (10%)   WardenSwap will also distribute $OP to referral programs users which benefit referrers who use referral link programs on Optimism through WardenSwap to spread the power of Optimism.  Marketing: Ecosystem & Optimism Representing (35%)   $OP will be used as a part of marketing campaigns targeted on Optimism, including the events for the WardenSwap community that make impact on Optimism, the competition which can take in many forms for different contributors such as researchers, and content creators. Also incentive to influencers that help the WardenSwap community on Optimism to create marketing programs and promotion.  Development & Maintenance (10%)   $OP will be dedicated to cover the development and maintenance cost of Optimism related project  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?  More users will be enticed to join WardenSwap as a result of these distributions, giving the protocol more usage. In combination with the developer subsidies it would strongly encourage developers to switch to Optimism.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?  We build things that last long WardenSwap knows that incentive programs will never last long, but we have absolute trust in smart contracts that are built on Optimism will be long lasting.WardenSwap always carry on our mission to deliver the best swap rates and best gas across multiple pools, which will stay to benefit WardenSwap users on Optimism to brings about a better outcome (Yes, save users\u2019 money).  How much will your project match in co-incentives? We are currently unable to co-incentivize, but we may work on it in as a campaign that is related to Optimism, also we do believe in the future of Optimism that there is a lot of opportunity, WardenSwap will move along forward to work with other Optimism\u2019s partners which help Optimism to strengthen their community.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? According to WardenSwap\u2019s plan, the $OP tokens will be distributed within a 1 year period. ",

Proposal to stop Phase 0 Projects to submit new proposal in Phase 1 \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       There were 20+ projects in Phase 0, some of them has a good plan to distribute the token while other does not. Here is an excellent summary by @MinimalGravitas .  Phase 0 officially concluded yesterday and soon OP will distribute 36M token between Phase 0 projects. Announcement  With this proposal, I want to share my idea and seeking your feedback on whether to allow Phase 0 projects to submit another funding proposal in phase 1 or not .  In my opinion, as long as previous funds are not exhauste\u2026         Accountability of Phase 0/1 Funds given to projects \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       That is a good question, and this is what I was thinking.  For integration fund, one example will be Infinity Wallet proposal where 80% is going for dev and integration - Let\u2019s say project A is giving some incentive to project B for their integration, in this case I think it would not be a problem to share their address as both are public application.  For marketing and content creation (for example 80% Marketing proposal of Kromatika Proposal): - This depends on content creator(s), if they are \u2026     ",

                    "content": "Ultimately, it is a subjective assessment based on some quantitative data, qualitative insights from parties we know & our own previous experiences. We haven\u2019t fully quantified this assessment. On one side, we look at key KPIs for different categories in DeFi (DEX/Aggregators: Volume routed, Total Volume, Revenues, Users - partially filtered) and we do ofc look at Dashboards (Dune, Tokenterminal, etc.) like this DEX aggregator comparison. Soon, we\u2019ll also share more and more of the key KPIs per category on DeFi-Reporting.com and other websites. On the other side, we have done research for years, engaged in ecosystem building and I\u2019d call us crypto powerusers, who are active in DeFi communities and continue to follow developments. Hence, we are confident in assessing which projects add value to the stack or to ecosystems & and which are not. As it all started on Ethereum and we\u2019ve been most active there, there is a slight bias towards projects that have been live there and had significant amounts of users/community (verifiable by us; facilitated by tools that support Ethereum first). If we have a blind eye, please let us know. (For example, we\u2019ve seen Wardenswap with small market share on dashboards but haven\u2019t used it ourselves. Hope to provide first feedback ahead of voting in the upcoming Phases which would also give you time to pitch in.) RE: DEX AGGREGATORS   Cutting-edge protocols are still in 95% cases launched on Ethereum as you get composability with other cutting-edge projects and benefit from the biggest DeFi liquidity, swap volume etc\u2026 (If you got a DEX aggregator that is competitive on l1 Ethereum, it is likely also competitive on Eth l2 or chain x.)   DEX Aggregators will grow their market share vs DEXs in low-transaction-cost environments over the next years, and with further adoption and abstraction of the DeFi space   In this great Dashboard you can see the DEX and DEX Aggregator landscape on Optimism. This gives a good overview which DEXs and aggregators are most efficient (or have short-term very well-designed incentives): Uniswap & 1inch dominate without incentives.   Feel free to send a message if you want to continue the discussion - as we don\u2019t want to spam this thread. ",
