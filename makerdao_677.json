                    "content": "Hey all, Based on Derek\u2019s post and the supportive outcome of the Introduce Rate Limiter into Flapper poll we are proposing a key parameter for Rate Limiter called lid which is the total value of DAI allowed to be sent out to surplus auction at once. The Rate Limiter enables a more competitive bidding process between keepers and therefore protects Maker from low bids. We have analyzed historical bids of FLAP auctions in order to gain knowledge of how competitive the surplus auction keeper ecosystem is. Put simply, the higher the number of keepers who regularly participate in surplus auctions we observe and the more competitively they bid, the higher the surplus auctions\u2019 throughput we can enable. We analyzed FLAPs dataset from May 2021 and we specifically focused on TEND actions, which are the bids made by keepers:  64 unique keepers have participated in 1,541 surplus auctions and 2,533 TEND bids were made in this time frame Top 6 keeper addresses below represent three quarters of MKR related bids Median discount of all TENDs (incl. those not winning) to market prices was -17.02% (and -3.10% if we exclude price crash events such as in January) Out of 6 most active keepers, only 2 were actually consistently bidding in the last 6 months (green and blue keeper on the chart below) Yellow keeper bids very infrequently and turquoise keeper bid only in recent Flappy Friday event Red and Orange keeper both posted zero bids in the recent Flappy Friday event, while Orange keeper already posted many zero bids in May 2021 Red keeper\u2019s address who triggered zero bids on Flappy Friday is associated with Blue keeper who normally bids very competitive   Chart1600\u00d7786 193 KB  Since the analysis above includes volatile events when we naturally see high participation, we wanted to also see how competitive the bidding process is when we had a lower amount of surplus auctions kicked within a day - similarly as it will occur by introducing rate limiter. The dataset below includes 580 surplus auctions kicked off in the last 3 months and excludes days where we had many more auctions kicked at once due to large liquidation penalty income (days in December 2021 and January 2022). The keepers colored in the chart below are the same keepers that we analyzed above (exception is the turquoise one who bid only on Flappy Friday).  We can observe that the bidding process is much less competitive when we have only a few auctions kicked off per day There are essentially only 2 keepers that consistently bid (green and blue) Yellow keeper hasn\u2019t made a bid between November and until recently in January (excluded in the dataset below as mentioned). Orange keeper bids infrequently and posted few 0 bids in the past as he did on Flappy Friday (-100% can\u2019t be seen on chart below) Red keeper was also bidding infrequently, although he never posted 0 bids as he did on Flappy Friday where he triggered 343 auctions with 0 bid.   Chart1404\u00d7742 127 KB  Takeaway:  2 consistent keepers behaving in a fair competitive way, while one of them is associated with 0-bidder address 2 keepers behaving maliciously posting 0 bids when possible 2 keepers bidding infrequently Potentially another 30-40 very infrequent keepers that could join surplus auctions (estimate from Flappy Friday event)  This takeaway makes us propose a very conservative lid parameter of 150.000 DAI, which means we\u2019d be able to settle a maximum of 5 surplus auctions every 30 minutes or 7.2m DAI per day. The two largest and most consistent keepers currently hold about $1.3m of liquid crypto assets in their wallets. One of them has 150 MKR which is usually \u201crecycled\u201d in surplus auctions. This makes us believe a 150.000 DAI limit on surplus auctions throughput should be conservative enough. A short note on current Surplus Auction implementation with Rate Limiter: The new Rate Limited Flapper implementation will help protect Maker against low bids. However, we believe that an additional configuration may be needed that also limits the amount of surplus auctions in a specific time period. An implementation that allows Maker governance to set the upper limit of the amount of surplus auctions in a specific period, rather than the existing approach of consecutive cycles, would be preferred.

IMHO even a lid  of 30k DAI would be okay - effectively enforcing 1 parallel flap - this would still result in a max-burn of 1.44m a DAI (which sounds like a lot). As this proposal is up for a couple of days already and I totally missed it (thanks EthDenver), I will support the onchain proposal but will start a Signal next week asking to decrease the lid. ",

An implementation that allows Maker governance to set the upper limit of the amount of surplus auctions in a specific period, rather than the existing approach of consecutive cycles, would be preferred.   If this gets developed, it would be nice to also add in a configuration for minimum amount of surplus auctions in a specific time period (when surplus buffer is above a configurable level). This would enable governance to satisfy a desire to continue burning MKR at a low, consistent level. For example, it could be configured to allow at least one flap auction (30k Dai) per 24 hours if the surplus buffer is above 50mil. ",
