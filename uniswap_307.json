I\u2019m afraid the technology might not be mature enough, at the very least it is quite hard to estimate what the risks are.   A totally fair assessment! In the meantime the Ren team are pushing ahead delivering more integrations with other chains and making it more secure, and decentralizing the network further. More chain support also means more assets can be listed on Uniswap (Polkadot assets, Binance Smart chain assets, Cosmos assets, Filecoin, Dogecoin etc.).     Darkhane:  Humm, I\u2019d rather wait until tBTC arrives. As far as I understand, It\u2019s backed by BTCs and ETHs stored on much more than one adress   RenVM has been live for 5 months now and has not had a single hack or user losing funds, and is progressively getting more decentralized. The point of the centralization has been to make sure that nothing bad would happen if something broke in the system, which has not happened. And as the system continually proves to be secure and robust, the number of active validators in the system will expand and the network will take on a sharded structure where not only are the backing assets custodied by different validator groups, but also the validator groups will be churned daily forming new groups controlling new addresses that custody the assets.

I personally agree that it would be really cool but there are other \u201cbig name\u201d pairs that would draw holders of other tokens to decide to pool their tokens. The whole goal of deciding on new pools eligible for rewards is to increase the overall liquidity, so adding a pool like LINK/ETH would be more beneficial due to the number of Link holders. (Chainlink\u2019s higher market cap would lead to a larger liquidity pool than what SNX/ETH could provide) I also think UNI/ETH would be a natural selection to be added perhaps before SNX/ETH gets added. SNX could come at a much later time. Thoughts? ",

There is no real outlined motivation nor goal that is stated for this proposal, I\u2019d like to see more explanation around why this would be good for Uniswap. I believe every proposal for Uniswap should have clearly defined outcomes that are positive sum and beneficial for Uniswap both as a community and as a protocol.   The current pairs right now such as ETH/DAI, ETH/USDC, ETHWBTC etc. are staple liquidity pools for DeFi as a whole itself. Better liquidity here both creates a more stable ecosystem as well as establishes greater defensibililty against other competing AMMs DEXs out there in terms of liquidity. I argue that $YFI as great of a project as it is would not fit this bucket (not used as collateral, like other assets mentioned here, but instead is a governance token).   Favouring non-staple DeFi assets without a objective reason, potentially threatens the neutrality of Uniswap as a fairly governed public good. This is not to say that this proposal would immediately damage the credibility of Uniswap itself but I do believe it is a slippery slope to a myriad of problems. While I do believe that political political neutrality doesn\u2019t really exist, non-objective decision making is a weakness and would eventually be exploited by bad actors. Rationality is our best strength as a crowd.   As much as I want this proposal to pass to pump my $YFI bags, I think that for those reasons above, I am pass on this one. ",

Just to expand a little bit on it, I think Uniswap should be targeting rewards primarily at \u201cbridge asset pairs\u201d. eg. Compare USDC token liquidity:    uniswap.info    Uniswap Info      to YFI liquidity:    uniswap.info    Uniswap Info      The only pair with real volume for YFI is the YFI/ETH pair. USDC has several additional pairs with substantial volume and liquidity, and in some cases trades will be routed through USDC even if it\u2019s not the asset being sold or bought directly - acting as a bridge like ETH.

This keeps a certain amount of liquidity there to make trading those pools viable.

Perhaps, the weight of a Single-Asset addition of $UNI outweighs the binary additions to pools. In response to @ETHisFunny: Token buy-back would be profound by batching automated liquidity sweeps via a $UNI wallet designed to HODL/capture % of circulating supply from (x) amount of transactions at (x) rate of time intervals. These liquidity sweeps can also delegate a % of the sweep to supply payouts to $UNI holders as an incentive; therefore pulling supply off the market as transactions take place and redistributing to HODLing patrons; thus increasing incentive. Perhaps, xDai or 1inch CHI can help with gas fees; in terms of frequent transactions. Thoughts\u2026 ",

This is probably something that was already planned in V3, but yeah part of every transaction fee say 1% could be swept into a wallet or maybe instead a wallet could be created in tandem with a pool that owns a flat proportion of the total pool. When the fees collected reach a threshold any user could \u201charvest\u201d it. It would then be banked in a fund which could be used to buy UNI from the UNI-ETH Pool. Users who then staked UNI could claim their portion of the buyback, proportional to the amount they staked. I\u2019ve done some coding over the years but I\u2019m not very good, so don\u2019t expect a written up contract out of me. Just an idea that could help the tokenomics and incentivize protocol use.

                    "content": "We shouldn\u2019t add UNI/ETH pair as part of liquidity mining pool. Before explaining my position, I would like to disclose that I do in fact own a significant amount of UNI tokens. TL;DR: UNI/ETH pool is a short term increase in UNI demand to pump the price and has little long term benefit for Uniswap and UNI holders. Instead, we should use the Liquidity Mining rewards to steal markets from competitors like Curve and centralized exchanges. Full reply: First of all, it is clear that the main rational behind adding UNI/ETH as a reward pool is to increase the demand for UNI and hence increase its price. This is defi farming 101 and the reason why the Pool 2 is usually given a 5-10x reward boost. However, the goal of UNI distribution program should be two folds:  Distribute governance tokens to participants that care about Uniswap and will ensure its success Incentivize liquidity where it\u2019s most needed  1 was fairly well achieved by the ad-hoc distribution and by the fact that liquidity mining will only be small % of UNI distributed. To achieve 1, it\u2019s important that liquidity mining is only a small portion of how UNI tokens are distributed. Lets not lie to ourselves; liquidity miners, myself included, just want to farm for the sake of being able to buy our favorite assets. We are liquidity locusts swarming from one farm to the other until nothing remains. That being said, liquidity mining is a powerful tool and we can wield it for the long term good of Uniswap. If we are to use financial incentives for the good of Uniswap, then lets not use it to create a demand pressure that will quickly dissipate once the rewards halt, achieving nothing but only short term price jubilation. In my opinion, a better use of liquidity mining could be use to steal markets from competitors. For instance, we could pick currencies that are most traded on Binance or Coinbase to try to bring back these tokens trader back to Uniswap. Alternatively, we could encourage stablecoin/stablecoin pairs to make Uniswap competitive with Curve and Swerve. Lets think long term. ",

Realistically UNI currently has a $500m+ market cap with ~$50m in uniswap liquidity, as well as centralised exchanges, etc - Don\u2019t see the reason to distribute more UNI tokens to ETH:UNI LP\u2019s. I wouldn\u2019t want to deposit my LP tokens into the pool anyway - holding, participating in governance & eventually collecting protocol fees with my UNI tokens is significantly more interesting than getting IL rekt from being an LP.

Your comment does make a lot of sense, but I think adding UNI/ETH could help the whole liquidity mining program if done in a smart way. Of course, not all of the mined UNI reward should go to UNI/ETH, only a small percentage like 10%. We would still have 90% of the reward to allocate to strategic pairs. And if adding UNI/ETH cause the price of UNI to pump, now the 90% of the reward would be worth more than 100% of it with UNI at a lower price. Adding a mining reward to strategic pairs should still be the main focus of the liquidity mining program, but 9 UNI worth 7$ are a bigger incentive then 10 UNI worth 5$. ",

In my opinion UNI/ETH pool is the only \u2018speculative asset\u2019 pool that makes sense to add for additional UNI distribution.  Let\u2019s take a look at it from UNI token holder\u2019s point of view.  At this point in time if you want to maximize the amount of UNI tokens you own over the next 4 years of the token distribution, it is not quite obvious whether or not you should add your UNI tokens to UNI/ETH liquidity pool or just hold them. Because there is a real risk that if over the next 4 years UNI price rises over ETH significantly and stays that way, that because of impermanent loss problem you\u2019ll have less UNI than a person who did nothing with them, i.e. who didn\u2019t provide value for the network in terms of adding liquidity. So distributing some additional UNI towards UNI/ETH liquidity providers would eliminate that problem and make the decision easy for long term UNI holder.  On the other hand, it would complicate the decision for liquidity providers of other current pairs.  For example, if you\u2019re providing liquidity on ETH/USDT \u2018for money\u2019, at this point it\u2019s quite obvious for you to sell the crops for your yield farm for a coin that has store of value capacity. Like, a YFI vault pool would make a perfect job for you at executing whatever APY there is to be farmed by just mining and selling the UNI tokens. If we were to introduce UNI/ETH rewards, these calculations become much less obvious, which in turn removes a decent bit of selling pressure from UNI token . So both points feed into supporting long term holders of UNI token . And getting them to own bigger % of overall supply, which is fundamentally a good thing for the network development. ",

Given that liquidity provision is the main proposition Uniswap offers don\u2019t you think that: UNI token that provides liquidity in UNI-ETH pair is more valuable to the ecosystem then the UNI token that drains that liquidity by being staked ? My position is that UNI/ETH Pool tokens provide more value to the ecosystem then UNI tokens alone. This means two things for me:  UNI/ETH Pool tokens should have some sort of UNI loss insurance compared to simple holding of UNI tokens. This could be granted by a moderate amount of extra distribution of UNI tokens towards UNI/ETH pool UNI/ETH Pool tokens should be granted  proportional voting rights to the amount of UNI locked in liquidity pair proportional amount of fees that are given to UNI holders    By no means do I argue with the point that fees distributed towards UNI token holders would bring the value to the token, I think it\u2019s the most obvious thing to do.

But I do not think that it is all about volume only: it is also about liquidity and it is also about governance. From the governance standpoint it\u2019s quite important that as many UNI tokens as possible either stay in people\u2019s wallets or are locked in Uniswap contracts. I think it is beneficial to encourage participation in UNI governance, and one just feeds into the other in the proposition I made. I\u2019m sure there are alternative ways to solve for the same things. Incentivization of UNI pairs + granting UNI LPs voting rights:  makes it obvious that it is more fruitful to keep your UNI on Uniswap than on any other exchange  allows UNI maximalists to participate in the distribution event in a safe way . People who only want to own UNI and ETH in this topic\u2019s case. I definitely do think that this group of actors both deserves to receive the distribution rewards and is likely to contribute to the protocol development.  It makes UNI produce value within the protocol instead of just sitting on the sidelines.  It is logical that when you get a mining rig in a mining factory \u2013 you mine. So it seems logical to me that the main token of a decentralized liquidity platform is super liquid, and it doesn\u2019t compromise its governance. In a good, fair system where incentives align evenly different groups of actors tend to mix with each other. It shouldn\u2019t be a choice for you to get rewards because you vote or because you mine liquidity with your token, you should be able to do both as both provide value for the network. If I were to propose the amount of additional UNI distributed to a pool, it would intend to create quite a moderate increase in the APY. I think that it would sound more or less fair if the APY for UNI pair would be on par with other pairs. Also I do think that it is irresponsible to bring tokens that have weak store of value properties to Uniswap liquidity mining programme. So I would like to bring at least some of those properties to UNI, and the best way to do that is through fees distribution. I do consider that just generally adding more UNI pairs would be beneficial for the token, not just UNI/ETH, but also UNI/USD and UNI/BTC. Let all the maximalists in  But even beyond that, having more traded UNI pairs would very likely be beneficial. UNI could become the reserve currency of Uniswap, why not? If we were to manage UNI as an exchange token, exchanges do tend to list a ton of pairs for their tokens. Maybe it is not neccessary, the key question is: is it valueable enough that we wish to spend treasury funds to incentivise it? I think at least incentivizing UNI/ETH and UNI/USD would be valuable, but maybe 1 type of dollar is enough. But at the same time it is crucial that we don\u2019t grant these pairs crazy APYs, as it would ruin everything very fast. ",

If we don\u2019t do this bots will continue to farm and dump using market orders, making the UNI market more chaotic than it needs to be. #3 Instead of farmer bots instantly dumping all of their UNI (sometimes not even on our exchange!), they might direct a portion of it back into the UNI/ETH pool.

                    "content": "Moving this year since Marco yelled at me  Hey Everyone, I wanted to share some thoughts on the two main proposals being discussed within this governance channel, and why I think we should be championing a UNI/ETH farming pool before any retroactive airdrop that @nadav_dharma and the rest of the Dharma team have been proposing. This proposal is in no way questioning the merits of the retroactive airdrop. As an analyst working in this space I have my own opinions on it, but it will ultimately come down to governance to decide what to do. That is what is nice about governance tokens, my opinion doesn\u2019t matter. To discuss why I think a UNI/ETH rewards pool should come before any retroactive airdrop, I want to take a high level look at what has worked over the past few months in during the yield craze. To me the what has surprised me the most has not been the amount of capital going into farming (You can see growth in TVL here: https://defipulse.com/) but the speed at which this capital has been rotating to different assets. There is no other asset class where billions of dollars can rotate investments in a few clicks at 3am on a Sunday night  But to me this makes it clear that these new assets have no investible moat. That has lead me to ask what does have a moat, and what else is benefiting from this trend when looking at how to invest. To me this is pretty clear, it is the underlying assets that are used to earn yield in almost all new farming projects. This is your YFI\u2019s, SNX\u2019s, LEND\u2019s, and LINK\u2019s. These have all been assets used to farm in multiple farming projects from YAM to Kimchi, and all saw increases in price because of it. I see this because of two reasons. The first being it locks up a significant percentage of the circulating supply causing a liquidity crisis on the buyside. With high yields, more people look to buy the underlying asset to capture that yield, causing a recursive feedback loop to the upside. The second and more important is that it gives an additional use case to a governance token. The token is  making people money rather than just a say in governance  I discussed this more in another thread about whether the fee switch should be a dividend or a token burn.(Message 47, [POLL] How Would We Structure a Fee Reward? ) Alittle different, but apply the same line of thinking here. Turning towards a UNI/ETH pool. By having UNI as an underlying asset to earn more UNI we would accomplish both of the two things outlined above. We would lock up a significant chunk of UNI and holders of UNI would make money/earn yield rather than just a say in governance, and ultimately help end the sell pressure that UNI has been seeing. It would also begin pulling UNI off of centralized exchanges, which I think is everyone\u2019s goal. This should be done before any vote on either retroactive airdrop proposal because it will provide a way for the new UNI holders to make more money instead of just seeing 400 UNI offers across all exchanges. I believe a UNI/ETH rewards pool will have a significant impact on slowing down any dilution in the form of retroactive airdrops as well as begin building a price floor for UNI overall, and would love to see this proposal up for a vote and active before any retroactive airdrop proposals. I am happy to answer any questions or concerns to what I have outlined above. Long UNI. ",

                    "content": "God a lot of posts here. I have some issues with governance tokens in Liquidity pools. Pros:  Pairing a governance token that has value with another token (I would prefer this be to a stablecoin like DAI, USDC etc.) in effect the UNI UNI-DAI or UNI-USDC token has sqrt less volatility than the UNI token alone.   The positive of a large number of people holding these is if a significant portion of the outstanding does this - it can provide a price support - and acts as a measure of confidence in the project.   For UNI holders holding UNI in these pairs is a way to dampen price volatility as the UNI UNI-stablecoin volatility goes by sqrt of price moves.  Particularly relative to the stablecoin price.  Cons  Incentivizing these basically drains liquidity that would be used for governance.  I have a 3rd suggestion btw.   How about rewarding people who provide liquidity in the common pools that also not just hold UNI in their wallets but have also participated in governance with it?   This seems a more sensible way to additionally reward people who hold UNI.  Give them a LP reward that includes a bonus based on the UNI in the LP providers wallet participating in governance decisions.   Weight it as a UNI held at time of a vote (i.e. what they could vote) over all the times a vote happened to create a 0-1 weight of that UNI participating in governance and give them their governance participation weight * the UNI LP provider participation amount.   This way you have to be a LP provider into a uniswap farming fund that gives UNI rewards AND be active in governance to receive any of the extra UNI returns based on your wallets governance participation. Based on the above I want to abstain.   IF we could have UNI UNI-pairs included in governance AND  earn a UNI return I would be all for adding all UNI UNI-tokenpairs into governance with UNI rewards generally as well as a bonus for people who used the UNI in the UNI UNI-tokenpairs and any other UNI in governance as I describe in the suggestion above.

I just want everyone to be aware of the issues that come along with incentivizing locking up a governance token without taking necessary steps beforehand. We experienced this at YAM and I would like to pass my learnings onto this community. There has already been an issue with getting enough delegation power to pass proposals. If this is implemented, it will almost certainly lock governance if the system stays as it is and a UNI/ETH pool is added. This is because of how the Compound-esc governance system works. Any UNI in the incentivizer will have 0 voting power. There would need to be additional work done to add voting power to the incentivizer staking contract as well as the Governor contract to prevent total lockup of the voting system. Again to really nail the idea home: \u201cjust adding a UNI/ETH pool isn\u2019t hard\u201d is wrong and actually requires major changes to incentivizer contract and the governor. I\u2019m not sure who would implement this as I doubt it is a priority for the team ",

Already, there are notable incentives for pooling UNI:ETH because you get the normal liquidity provider fees.  Adding more incentive beyond that makes the incentive misalignment problem even worse. The core of the problem is that the way voting and delegation is currently implement means that you have to choose to either participate in governance or participate in liquidity pooling.  You cannot, currently, both participate in liquidity pooling and participate in governance. If we first address the problem of being unable to vote while also pooling, then this proposal becomes slightly more reasonable.  However, as it stands I think anything that incentivizes doing something with UNI other than holding it in a wallet is a bad idea. ",

I do agree that enabling LP to vote is useful. But it can be implemented later. The $UNI is a governance token, but it is first and foremost a token, ie a value capture mechanism. It\u2019s a flaw in the token model not to have a sink or value capture. I\u2019m happy to discuss this point on Discord, but I have been making that point for weeks now, I\u2019m surprised we\u2019re still going back and forth on this point.

Eg. increased ETH/USDC depth improves the trading experience for many additional assets beyond USDC and ETH by virtue of users being able to trade USDC <> other assets with more liquidity. USDC is also directly paired with many assets on UniV2, so it may improve generalized liquidity for ETH as well. I\u2019d argue the same applies for DAI, USDT, and WBTC, but isn\u2019t applicable to SNX. The only people who benefit directly from incentivizing SNX liquidity depth are SNX holders. I\u2019d be much more interested in an sUSD/ETH pool for incentives, as this could serve as bridge liquidity between Uniswap and the Synthetix Exchange. PS.
