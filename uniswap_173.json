            "body": "## **Summary**\n\n* Nomic Labs, the team behind Hardhat, has become the Nomic Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum. Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world.\n* The Nomic Foundation\u2019s work will be focused on Ethereum\u2019s developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereum\u2019s public goods support structures.\n* [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams.\n* The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereum\u2019s dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components.\n* Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures.\n* **We\u2019re proposing to Uniswap Governance to make a contribution of $5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.**\n\n## **Nomic Foundation**\n\nNomic Labs has been fully dedicated to Ethereum developer experience since 2019, and we\u2019re [now pivoting](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/introducing-the-nomic-foundation-an-ethereum-public-goods-organization-31012af67df9) to a non-profit foundation formally dedicated to Ethereum. We\u2019re aiming to build a long-lasting organization that makes Ethereum\u2019s public goods support structures stronger by contributing to the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s existing efforts, and reducing the ecosystem\u2019s reliance on any one organization for development platform components.\n\n### **Roadmap**\n\nGiven the size and innovation pace of the ecosystem, there\u2019s no way to foresee exactly what needs developers are going to have as things scale. However, we do know what engineering foundations the ecosystem will need in order to build its own solutions.\n\nOur overarching engineering strategy is to empower the ecosystem to build its own specialized tools. This plan is based on four strategic pillars of the stack, each of which offers an opportunity to leverage a platform to empower the ecosystem to keep building open-source infrastructure.\n\nFor each of these pillars, we will build a platform. The four ecosystem pillars and platform opportunities we\u2019ve identified are:\n\n1. Solidity\n2. EVM tooling\n3. Local development environment\n4. Ethereum connector library\n\n## **The projects**\n\n### **Slang & Rethnet**\n\nOver the long term, these are our most important projects. Targeting the Solidity and EVM tooling pillars, Slang and Rethnet will serve as core infrastructure for the ecosystem to build new tools faster, cheaper, and better. We\u2019re essentially building the tools that would have let us build Hardhat a lot faster. We previously published a [Medium post](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/slang-rethnet-2ad465fd7880) with high-level descriptions of how both projects will complement each other.\n\n**Slang**\n\nA Solidity compiler designed as a platform for tooling development, an approach also known as compiler as a service. Its top priority will be servicing tools through domain-specific APIs. Much like .Net\u2019s Roslyn, it will feature a compilation pipeline made of distinct reusable components with standalone APIs. A completely modular design guarantees that others can build on top of it by replacing the part of functionality they need to, and reusing everything else:\n\n1. Parser that is only concerned with producing trees from code. Usable on its own, for example, to create third-party formatters like Prettier plugins.\n2. Semantic analysis (binding) is concerned only with building a type system and validating the produced trees. Usable on its own, to implement third-party type checking, security/threat models, and more advanced third-party linting.\n3. Code generation. By replacing just this isolated part, the compiler can compile for different targets (e.g. non-EVM L2s).\n4. Language services. These will receive an immutable representation of the above (syntax trees, bound trees, codegen settings), and will only be tasked with answering questions. Usable on its own to expose in different IDEs (same service for VSCode, IntelliJ, Vim, etc). Reusable to extend the functionality of other editor features (task runners, testing, deployment, CI, debugging).\n5. Runtime observation APIs to support Rethnet.\n\nAll of this will be reusable to create entirely new EVM programming languages, since by replacing the parser and type system, one can get an entire high-quality toolchain working from the get-go.\n\n**Rethnet**\n\nTo provide a simulated environment where developers can build and test their Ethereum software, tools need to replicate many of the components that make up a full Ethereum node implementation. This is a significant engineering effort, which given the complexity of Ethereum, represents a barrier to entry to tooling development given the depth of knowledge that is required.\n\nRethnet aims to make this easier by offering a native, flexible, extensible, fast, and language-agnostic EVM local development network, distributed as a Rust library, that is designed to be the underlying core in tools that provide debugging information to developers (like Hardhat, Foundry, Remix, Truffle, DappTools, etc). It will be a Rust library made to be consumed from other languages like TypeScript, Go, Python, etc as a native dependency. It will implement the baseline of essential functionality every tool should have like Solidity console.log, stack traces, and descriptive error messages, as well as implement code coverage, gas profiling, and a step debugger. At its core, it\u2019s an implementation of an Ethereum node with a layer of EVM runtime observation to provide development features.\n\nBuilding a new Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, or DappTools using Rethnet will be a much more manageable project, and Rethnet will be completely reusable for any EVM language through adapters.\n\n### **Hardhat**\n\nOur flagship project targets the local development environment pillar, and it\u2019s currently at an advanced level of progress and adoption. While Slang and Rethnet mature and catalyze organic growth in the tooling space, developers still have needs to be met, positioning Hardhat as our immediate-term solution to empower developers to keep decentralizing the world.\n\nHardhat is an Ethereum development environment that developers use to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software. Most importantly, it\u2019s highly flexible, extensible, and designed to empower the community to build their own solutions. This strategy has been successful, and there\u2019s already [a valuable ecosystem of reusable plugins](https://hardhat.org/plugins/).\n\nHardhat\u2019s roadmap is focused on becoming an extensible development environment with deep integrations across components in key areas of the tooling stack:\n\n* [Hardhat VSCode](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/hardhat-vscode-9de29467fc26) \u2014 programming editor\n* [Hardhat Ignition](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/hardhat-ignition-5a34a4e3d2de) \u2014 contract deployment\n* [Hardhat Network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/) \u2014 local development network\n* [Hardhat Runner](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview) \u2014 build/testing workflow\n\nThis roadmap leads to developers being well equipped to build powerful extensions to their workflow that increase their productivity according to their exact needs, and to then share them with the ecosystem in the form of plugins.\n\nHardhat will also eventually migrate to using Rethnet and Slang, increasing its feature richness, speed, and stability while enabling dogfooding at scale for our brand new building blocks.\n\n### **Web3.js as a frontend platform**\n\nThe OG Ethereum connector library, Web3.js, is being revitalized into a high-value project. By focusing on community and ecosystem growth, supported by an extensible architecture, it can become a great source of value, much like React represents in the front-end world, but for dapps. A website hub connecting community spaces, support spaces, educational resources, extensions, and related projects, combined with an active ecodev effort (workshops, talks, contests, and incentives), will create a source of leverage for the ecosystem. This will provide better troubleshooting, faster developer training, more reusable code, and, most importantly, the possibility of extending the library. This effort is currently spearheaded by the ChainSafe team.\n\n## **Funding**\n\nThe Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we\u2019re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we\u2019re aiming to raise $15M more.\n\n## **Why Uniswap?**\n\nGenerally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we\u2019ve approached and will continue approaching several protocols.\n\nCurrently, Uniswap [is built using Hardhat](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts). While this is a signal of Hardhat\u2019s value, the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap, but for the entire ecosystem. We\u2019ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:\n\n1. Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat).\n2. Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem.\n3. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires.\n4. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built.\n5. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.\n\nWe believe this grows the market for everyone, including Uniswap, and we\u2019d love to have the **Uniswap DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort** .",

Ecosystem growth requires more developers to build more software on top of Ethereum. Developer adoption and learning speed, core contributors to this growth, are critically affected by developer experience.\n\nThe rate at which the ecosystem innovates, coming up with new creations and solving difficult problems, both at the dapp layer and EVM/Solidity/Vyper layer, is also directly affected by developer productivity.\n\nSoftware development platforms aren't new, and playbooks established by the great developer experience success stories (Rust, .Net, TypeScript, etc) prove that achieving a quality developer experience requires a specialized approach paired with a long-term, big-picture strategy. The potential impact in executing a dedicated effort for Ethereum would increase the ecosystem\u2019s pace of innovation and growth, building a powerful compounding effect over the long term for the entire industry.\n\nThe inspiration for our vision came from our experience building Hardhat, which allowed us to see how deeply challenging it is to build sophisticated Ethereum tooling. **These challenges must be alleviated to bring about organic ecosystem-led improvement of developer experience that achieves world-class quality.**\n\n## **Nomic Foundation**\n\nNomic Labs has been fully dedicated to Ethereum developer experience since 2019, and we're [now pivoting](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/introducing-the-nomic-foundation-an-ethereum-public-goods-organization-31012af67df9) to a non-profit foundation formally dedicated to Ethereum.

Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world. The Nomic Foundation\u2019s work will be focused on Ethereum\u2019s developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereum\u2019s public goods support structures.  Hardhat is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams. The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereum\u2019s dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components. Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures. We\u2019re proposing to Uniswap Governance to make a contribution of $5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.   What is developer experience?  If you are already familiar with this concept feel free to skip this section, if you\u2019d like to learn more, keep on reading. Understanding developer experience starts with realizing that software development platforms are multi-layered technical products and that software engineers are their users. Developer experience is analogous to UX for software developers, particularly UX in professional tools that are essential for abstract tasks and have direct impacts on productivity, effectiveness, happiness, frustration, and therefore cost. The practice of software development is a complex discipline, and developer experience is significantly different from the UX of a note-taking app. When a professional is working on an intricate problem that requires deep thinking and accessing information via a tool, or when one\u2019s creative output is directly limited by the capabilities of their tool, then the professional will be directly restricted\u2014or empowered\u2014by the tools being used. An additional aspect that may not be obvious and emphasizes the impact tooling has, is that developers frequently don\u2019t understand what they\u2019ve created. Writing code that doesn\u2019t behave as expected is routine, and the process of making it work as expected (debugging) is one of the core activities of software development, which is heavily aided by development tools. Developer experience is about the effectiveness of interactions with platforms and their tools, as well as the feelings that arise when trying to meet a specific software development objective with them. Empowering users to create something without knowing what they\u2019re going to be creating is a difficult challenge. The author of a tool or platform cannot optimize for a specific use case, only for the abstract needs of software development in general. In addition, the development platform that software is built on ultimately becomes part of the software itself, and very often, the software directly interacts in some way with the tools. Since the created software is dynamic and has a limitless life of its own, it\u2019s easy for tools and platforms to end up constraining what is created or how. Software development, in general, is a moving target that keeps evolving. Tools and platforms need to accommodate a future that is partially unknown, making achieving a solid developer experience a challenge. Some aspects that contribute to a good developer experience include:  Ability to get up and running quickly as a beginner Clear, thorough, and detailed documentation that\u2019s easy to explore and facilitates learning Accessible developer community as a support resource Freedom and flexibility to take the preferred path towards a solution without rigid obstacles Ability to easily gather relevant technical information related to code failure Clear and explicit error messages that explain issues and suggest potential solutions Automatic resolution of tedious automatable tasks Reusable infrastructure to easily build ad-hoc solutions Availability of specialized tools for domain-specific problems (local environments, programming editors, debuggers, etc) Fast performance  Developers are empowered to meet their objectives with a high degree of comfort and efficiency when there are high-quality resources available, well-designed architectures with APIs that get out of the way, and insightful tooling functionalities to address domain-specific problems. When the basic tenets of developer experience aren\u2019t met, developers feel frustrated and suffer significantly lower productivity.  Ethereum developer experience  When it comes to Ethereum, which is primarily a software development platform to build decentralized systems, developer experience is a key strategic aspect for success. Ecosystem growth requires more developers to build more software on top of Ethereum. Developer adoption and learning speed, core contributors to this growth, are critically affected by developer experience. The rate at which the ecosystem innovates, coming up with new creations and solving difficult problems, both at the dapp layer and EVM/Solidity/Vyper layer, is also directly affected by developer productivity. Software development platforms aren\u2019t new, and playbooks established by the great developer experience success stories (Rust, .Net, TypeScript, etc) prove that achieving a quality developer experience requires a specialized approach paired with a long-term, big-picture strategy. The potential impact in executing a dedicated effort for Ethereum would increase the ecosystem\u2019s pace of innovation and growth, building a powerful compounding effect over the long term for the entire industry. The inspiration for our vision came from our experience building Hardhat, which allowed us to see how deeply challenging it is to build sophisticated Ethereum tooling. These challenges must be alleviated to bring about organic ecosystem-led improvement of developer experience that achieves world-class quality.  Nomic Foundation  Nomic Labs has been fully dedicated to Ethereum developer experience since 2019, and we\u2019re now pivoting to a non-profit foundation formally dedicated to Ethereum. We\u2019re aiming to build a long-lasting organization that makes Ethereum\u2019s public goods support structures stronger by contributing to the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s existing efforts, and reducing the ecosystem\u2019s reliance on any one organization for development platform components.  Roadmap  Given the size and innovation pace of the ecosystem, there\u2019s no way to foresee exactly what needs developers are going to have as things scale. However, we do know what engineering foundations the ecosystem will need in order to build its own solutions. Our overarching engineering strategy is to empower the ecosystem to build its own specialized tools. This plan is based on four strategic pillars of the stack, each of which offers an opportunity to leverage a platform to empower the ecosystem to keep building open-source infrastructure. For each of these pillars, we will build a platform. The four ecosystem pillars and platform opportunities we\u2019ve identified are:  Solidity EVM tooling Local development environment Ethereum connector library   The projects   Slang & Rethnet  Over the long term, these are our most important projects. Targeting the Solidity and EVM tooling pillars, Slang and Rethnet will serve as core infrastructure for the ecosystem to build new tools faster, cheaper, and better. We\u2019re essentially building the tools that would have let us build Hardhat a lot faster. We previously published a Medium post with high-level descriptions of how both projects will complement each other. Slang A Solidity compiler designed as a platform for tooling development, an approach also known as compiler as a service. Its top priority will be servicing tools through domain-specific APIs. Much like .Net\u2019s Roslyn, it will feature a compilation pipeline made of distinct reusable components with standalone APIs. A completely modular design guarantees that others can build on top of it by replacing the part of functionality they need to, and reusing everything else:  Parser that is only concerned with producing trees from code. Usable on its own, for example, to create third-party formatters like Prettier plugins. Semantic analysis (binding) is concerned only with building a type system and validating the produced trees. Usable on its own, to implement third-party type checking, security/threat models, and more advanced third-party linting. Code generation. By replacing just this isolated part, the compiler can compile for different targets (e.g. non-EVM L2s). Language services. These will receive an immutable representation of the above (syntax trees, bound trees, codegen settings), and will only be tasked with answering questions. Usable on its own to expose in different IDEs (same service for VSCode, IntelliJ, Vim, etc). Reusable to extend the functionality of other editor features (task runners, testing, deployment, CI, debugging). Runtime observation APIs to support Rethnet.  All of this will be reusable to create entirely new EVM programming languages, since by replacing the parser and type system, one can get an entire high-quality toolchain working from the get-go. Rethnet To provide a simulated environment where developers can build and test their Ethereum software, tools need to replicate many of the components that make up a full Ethereum node implementation. This is a significant engineering effort, which given the complexity of Ethereum, represents a barrier to entry to tooling development given the depth of knowledge that is required. Rethnet aims to make this easier by offering a native, flexible, extensible, fast, and language-agnostic EVM local development network, distributed as a Rust library, that is designed to be the underlying core in tools that provide debugging information to developers (like Hardhat, Foundry, Remix, Truffle, DappTools, etc). It will be a Rust library made to be consumed from other languages like TypeScript, Go, Python, etc as a native dependency. It will implement the baseline of essential functionality every tool should have like Solidity console.log, stack traces, and descriptive error messages, as well as implement code coverage, gas profiling, and a step debugger. At its core, it\u2019s an implementation of an Ethereum node with a layer of EVM runtime observation to provide development features. Building a new Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, or DappTools using Rethnet will be a much more manageable project, and Rethnet will be completely reusable for any EVM language through adapters.  Hardhat  Our flagship project targets the local development environment pillar, and it\u2019s currently at an advanced level of progress and adoption. While Slang and Rethnet mature and catalyze organic growth in the tooling space, developers still have needs to be met, positioning Hardhat as our immediate-term solution to empower developers to keep decentralizing the world. Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment that developers use to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software. Most importantly, it\u2019s highly flexible, extensible, and designed to empower the community to build their own solutions. This strategy has been successful, and there\u2019s already a valuable ecosystem of reusable plugins. Hardhat\u2019s roadmap is focused on becoming an extensible development environment with deep integrations across components in key areas of the tooling stack:   Hardhat VSCode \u2014 programming editor  Hardhat Ignition \u2014 contract deployment  Hardhat Network \u2014 local development network  Hardhat Runner \u2014 build/testing workflow  This roadmap leads to developers being well equipped to build powerful extensions to their workflow that increase their productivity according to their exact needs, and to then share them with the ecosystem in the form of plugins. Hardhat will also eventually migrate to using Rethnet and Slang, increasing its feature richness, speed, and stability while enabling dogfooding at scale for our brand new building blocks.  Web3.js as a frontend platform  The OG Ethereum connector library, Web3.js, is being revitalized into a high-value project. By focusing on community and ecosystem growth, supported by an extensible architecture, it can become a great source of value, much like React represents in the front-end world, but for dapps. A website hub connecting community spaces, support spaces, educational resources, extensions, and related projects, combined with an active ecodev effort (workshops, talks, contests, and incentives), will create a source of leverage for the ecosystem. This will provide better troubleshooting, faster developer training, more reusable code, and, most importantly, the possibility of extending the library. This effort is currently spearheaded by the ChainSafe team.  Funding  The Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we\u2019re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it. The Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we\u2019re aiming to raise $15M more.  Why Uniswap?  Generally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we\u2019ve approached and will continue approaching several protocols. Currently, Uniswap is built using Hardhat. While this is a signal of Hardhat\u2019s value, the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap, but for the entire ecosystem. We\u2019ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:  Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat). Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.  We believe this grows the market for everyone, including Uniswap, and we\u2019d love to have the Uniswap DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort .  An ecosystem-wide effort  We\u2019re currently seeking funding from multiple DAOs. We\u2019ll update with the corresponding links below as we create each forum thread.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to be more specific about spending at this point, since we\u2019re creating an organization to execute on these projects, rather than assigning existing resources to projects and covering the costs with grants. If that were the case then it\u2019d be easy for us to say \u201c$200k worth of engineering time is going here this quarter\u201d, but in reality, we need to hire 30 more people, and where time will be invested as we grow will depend on a combination of factors, including priorities, skillset within the team, training and onboarding time, number of engineering leaders on the team, a product function being put together, etc. The order in which these things play out as an engineering organization grows is hard to predict. It\u2019s hard to be specific in any valuable way at this time, but the vast majority of the money will go towards salaries, and we\u2019ll likely do small-scale grants here and there. In terms of staffing, most of our projects can do with 1-3 people in the first few years, except for Slang and Rethnet which will need bigger teams of 4-5 people. We expect $30m to give us about 4-5 years of runway with a 30-40 people team, primarily engineering with a bit of product. In terms of transparency and accountability, we think that on the Hardhat side it will be fairly clear how much impact we\u2019re having, but we don\u2019t intend to just leave it at community awareness, since that\u2019s hard to quantify. I talked about this in the community call yesterday, but we do intend to define impact metrics and facilitate access to measurements to the community. On the building blocks side (Rethnet & Slang), the main thing to watch will be how many products & services with wide adoption are built on top of them. Thanks to open-source this will be fairly easy to track on Github. Currently, it\u2019s easy to see how many Hardhat plugins have been built by just running a Github search, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll likely rely on. On the Hardhat side, our KPIs today are Github repos using Hardhat, monthly active users who opted into telemetry, and the amount of plugins built by the community. Reports and automated dashboards are some of the ideas we have to share these concrete metrics with the ecosystem, which should make it clear that we\u2019re producing the impact we\u2019re meant to be producing.

Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world. The Nomic Foundation\u2019s work will be focused on Ethereum\u2019s developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereum\u2019s public goods support structures.  Hardhat is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams. The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereum\u2019s dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components. Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures. We\u2019re proposing to Uniswap Governance to make a contribution of $5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.   What is developer experience?  If you are already familiar with this concept feel free to skip this section, if you\u2019d like to learn more, keep on reading. Understanding developer experience starts with realizing that software development platforms are multi-layered technical products and that software engineers are their users. Developer experience is analogous to UX for software developers, particularly UX in professional tools that are essential for abstract tasks and have direct impacts on productivity, effectiveness, happiness, frustration, and therefore cost. The practice of software development is a complex discipline, and developer experience is significantly different from the UX of a note-taking app. When a professional is working on an intricate problem that requires deep thinking and accessing information via a tool, or when one\u2019s creative output is directly limited by the capabilities of their tool, then the professional will be directly restricted\u2014or empowered\u2014by the tools being used. An additional aspect that may not be obvious and emphasizes the impact tooling has, is that developers frequently don\u2019t understand what they\u2019ve created. Writing code that doesn\u2019t behave as expected is routine, and the process of making it work as expected (debugging) is one of the core activities of software development, which is heavily aided by development tools. Developer experience is about the effectiveness of interactions with platforms and their tools, as well as the feelings that arise when trying to meet a specific software development objective with them. Empowering users to create something without knowing what they\u2019re going to be creating is a difficult challenge. The author of a tool or platform cannot optimize for a specific use case, only for the abstract needs of software development in general. In addition, the development platform that software is built on ultimately becomes part of the software itself, and very often, the software directly interacts in some way with the tools. Since the created software is dynamic and has a limitless life of its own, it\u2019s easy for tools and platforms to end up constraining what is created or how. Software development, in general, is a moving target that keeps evolving. Tools and platforms need to accommodate a future that is partially unknown, making achieving a solid developer experience a challenge. Some aspects that contribute to a good developer experience include:  Ability to get up and running quickly as a beginner Clear, thorough, and detailed documentation that\u2019s easy to explore and facilitates learning Accessible developer community as a support resource Freedom and flexibility to take the preferred path towards a solution without rigid obstacles Ability to easily gather relevant technical information related to code failure Clear and explicit error messages that explain issues and suggest potential solutions Automatic resolution of tedious automatable tasks Reusable infrastructure to easily build ad-hoc solutions Availability of specialized tools for domain-specific problems (local environments, programming editors, debuggers, etc) Fast performance  Developers are empowered to meet their objectives with a high degree of comfort and efficiency when there are high-quality resources available, well-designed architectures with APIs that get out of the way, and insightful tooling functionalities to address domain-specific problems. When the basic tenets of developer experience aren\u2019t met, developers feel frustrated and suffer significantly lower productivity.  Ethereum developer experience  When it comes to Ethereum, which is primarily a software development platform to build decentralized systems, developer experience is a key strategic aspect for success. Ecosystem growth requires more developers to build more software on top of Ethereum. Developer adoption and learning speed, core contributors to this growth, are critically affected by developer experience. The rate at which the ecosystem innovates, coming up with new creations and solving difficult problems, both at the dapp layer and EVM/Solidity/Vyper layer, is also directly affected by developer productivity. Software development platforms aren\u2019t new, and playbooks established by the great developer experience success stories (Rust, .Net, TypeScript, etc) prove that achieving a quality developer experience requires a specialized approach paired with a long-term, big-picture strategy. The potential impact in executing a dedicated effort for Ethereum would increase the ecosystem\u2019s pace of innovation and growth, building a powerful compounding effect over the long term for the entire industry. The inspiration for our vision came from our experience building Hardhat, which allowed us to see how deeply challenging it is to build sophisticated Ethereum tooling. These challenges must be alleviated to bring about organic ecosystem-led improvement of developer experience that achieves world-class quality.  Nomic Foundation  Nomic Labs has been fully dedicated to Ethereum developer experience since 2019, and we\u2019re now pivoting to a non-profit foundation formally dedicated to Ethereum. We\u2019re aiming to build a long-lasting organization that makes Ethereum\u2019s public goods support structures stronger by contributing to the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s existing efforts, and reducing the ecosystem\u2019s reliance on any one organization for development platform components.  Roadmap  Given the size and innovation pace of the ecosystem, there\u2019s no way to foresee exactly what needs developers are going to have as things scale. However, we do know what engineering foundations the ecosystem will need in order to build its own solutions. Our overarching engineering strategy is to empower the ecosystem to build its own specialized tools. This plan is based on four strategic pillars of the stack, each of which offers an opportunity to leverage a platform to empower the ecosystem to keep building open-source infrastructure. For each of these pillars, we will build a platform. The four ecosystem pillars and platform opportunities we\u2019ve identified are:  Solidity EVM tooling Local development environment Ethereum connector library   The projects   Slang & Rethnet  Over the long term, these are our most important projects. Targeting the Solidity and EVM tooling pillars, Slang and Rethnet will serve as core infrastructure for the ecosystem to build new tools faster, cheaper, and better. We\u2019re essentially building the tools that would have let us build Hardhat a lot faster. We previously published a Medium post with high-level descriptions of how both projects will complement each other. Slang A Solidity compiler designed as a platform for tooling development, an approach also known as compiler as a service. Its top priority will be servicing tools through domain-specific APIs. Much like .Net\u2019s Roslyn, it will feature a compilation pipeline made of distinct reusable components with standalone APIs. A completely modular design guarantees that others can build on top of it by replacing the part of functionality they need to, and reusing everything else:  Parser that is only concerned with producing trees from code. Usable on its own, for example, to create third-party formatters like Prettier plugins. Semantic analysis (binding) is concerned only with building a type system and validating the produced trees. Usable on its own, to implement third-party type checking, security/threat models, and more advanced third-party linting. Code generation. By replacing just this isolated part, the compiler can compile for different targets (e.g. non-EVM L2s). Language services. These will receive an immutable representation of the above (syntax trees, bound trees, codegen settings), and will only be tasked with answering questions. Usable on its own to expose in different IDEs (same service for VSCode, IntelliJ, Vim, etc). Reusable to extend the functionality of other editor features (task runners, testing, deployment, CI, debugging). Runtime observation APIs to support Rethnet.  All of this will be reusable to create entirely new EVM programming languages, since by replacing the parser and type system, one can get an entire high-quality toolchain working from the get-go. Rethnet To provide a simulated environment where developers can build and test their Ethereum software, tools need to replicate many of the components that make up a full Ethereum node implementation. This is a significant engineering effort, which given the complexity of Ethereum, represents a barrier to entry to tooling development given the depth of knowledge that is required. Rethnet aims to make this easier by offering a native, flexible, extensible, fast, and language-agnostic EVM local development network, distributed as a Rust library, that is designed to be the underlying core in tools that provide debugging information to developers (like Hardhat, Foundry, Remix, Truffle, DappTools, etc). It will be a Rust library made to be consumed from other languages like TypeScript, Go, Python, etc as a native dependency. It will implement the baseline of essential functionality every tool should have like Solidity console.log, stack traces, and descriptive error messages, as well as implement code coverage, gas profiling, and a step debugger. At its core, it\u2019s an implementation of an Ethereum node with a layer of EVM runtime observation to provide development features. Building a new Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, or DappTools using Rethnet will be a much more manageable project, and Rethnet will be completely reusable for any EVM language through adapters.  Hardhat  Our flagship project targets the local development environment pillar, and it\u2019s currently at an advanced level of progress and adoption. While Slang and Rethnet mature and catalyze organic growth in the tooling space, developers still have needs to be met, positioning Hardhat as our immediate-term solution to empower developers to keep decentralizing the world. Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment that developers use to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software. Most importantly, it\u2019s highly flexible, extensible, and designed to empower the community to build their own solutions. This strategy has been successful, and there\u2019s already a valuable ecosystem of reusable plugins. Hardhat\u2019s roadmap is focused on becoming an extensible development environment with deep integrations across components in key areas of the tooling stack:   Hardhat VSCode \u2014 programming editor  Hardhat Ignition \u2014 contract deployment  Hardhat Network \u2014 local development network  Hardhat Runner \u2014 build/testing workflow  This roadmap leads to developers being well equipped to build powerful extensions to their workflow that increase their productivity according to their exact needs, and to then share them with the ecosystem in the form of plugins. Hardhat will also eventually migrate to using Rethnet and Slang, increasing its feature richness, speed, and stability while enabling dogfooding at scale for our brand new building blocks.  Web3.js as a frontend platform  The OG Ethereum connector library, Web3.js, is being revitalized into a high-value project. By focusing on community and ecosystem growth, supported by an extensible architecture, it can become a great source of value, much like React represents in the front-end world, but for dapps. A website hub connecting community spaces, support spaces, educational resources, extensions, and related projects, combined with an active ecodev effort (workshops, talks, contests, and incentives), will create a source of leverage for the ecosystem. This will provide better troubleshooting, faster developer training, more reusable code, and, most importantly, the possibility of extending the library. This effort is currently spearheaded by the ChainSafe team.  Funding  The Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we\u2019re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it. The Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we\u2019re aiming to raise $15M more.  Why Uniswap?  Generally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we\u2019ve approached and will continue approaching several protocols. Currently, Uniswap is built using Hardhat. While this is a signal of Hardhat\u2019s value, the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap, but for the entire ecosystem. We\u2019ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:  Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat). Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.  We believe this grows the market for everyone, including Uniswap, and we\u2019d love to have the Uniswap DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort.  An ecosystem-wide effort  We\u2019re currently seeking funding from multiple DAOs. We\u2019ll update with the corresponding links below as we create each forum thread.

While Nomic did a great job explaining the value proposition of their suite of DevEx tools, it would be nice if they could respond with these additional details. Nonetheless we are supportive of idea. We have confidence that Nomic has intentions to spend/exchange UNI responsibly. $5M worth of UNI is a drop in the bucket for the treasury.

In our eyes we\u2019re incentive-aligned to care for the relationship since an angry community likely means no more funding in the future, and the outcomes with a major DAO like Uniswap will impact every other DAO relationship. Having said that, we do need to sell the UNI for risk management reasons. Still, we\u2019ll do everything we can to minimize impact and avoid causing stress to the community. We\u2019ll engage an OTC desk specializing in lower liquidity pairs to execute the sale, which will distribute the impact across many liquidity pools, over time, rather than a one-off market sell order in a single liquidity pool. The length of the period for the execution will depend on the OTC desk\u2019s assessment of liquidity at the time of the sale, but I assume it\u2019d be many relatively small chunks over the course of a few weeks.

                    "content": " Summary   Nomic Labs, the team behind Hardhat, has become the Nomic Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum. Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world. The Nomic Foundation\u2019s work will be focused on Ethereum\u2019s developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereum\u2019s public goods support structures.  Hardhat is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams. The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereum\u2019s dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components. Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures. We\u2019re proposing to Uniswap Governance to make a contribution of $5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.   What is developer experience?  If you are already familiar with this concept feel free to skip this section, if you\u2019d like to learn more, keep on reading. Understanding developer experience starts with realizing that software development platforms are multi-layered technical products and that software engineers are their users. Developer experience is analogous to UX for software developers, particularly UX in professional tools that are essential for abstract tasks and have direct impacts on productivity, effectiveness, happiness, frustration, and therefore cost. The practice of software development is a complex discipline, and developer experience is significantly different from the UX of a note-taking app. When a professional is working on an intricate problem that requires deep thinking and accessing information via a tool, or when one\u2019s creative output is directly limited by the capabilities of their tool, then the professional will be directly restricted\u2014or empowered\u2014by the tools being used. An additional aspect that may not be obvious and emphasizes the impact tooling has, is that developers frequently don\u2019t understand what they\u2019ve created. Writing code that doesn\u2019t behave as expected is routine, and the process of making it work as expected (debugging) is one of the core activities of software development, which is heavily aided by development tools. Developer experience is about the effectiveness of interactions with platforms and their tools, as well as the feelings that arise when trying to meet a specific software development objective with them. Empowering users to create something without knowing what they\u2019re going to be creating is a difficult challenge. The author of a tool or platform cannot optimize for a specific use case, only for the abstract needs of software development in general. In addition, the development platform that software is built on ultimately becomes part of the software itself, and very often, the software directly interacts in some way with the tools. Since the created software is dynamic and has a limitless life of its own, it\u2019s easy for tools and platforms to end up constraining what is created or how. Software development, in general, is a moving target that keeps evolving. Tools and platforms need to accommodate a future that is partially unknown, making achieving a solid developer experience a challenge. Some aspects that contribute to a good developer experience include:  Ability to get up and running quickly as a beginner Clear, thorough, and detailed documentation that\u2019s easy to explore and facilitates learning Accessible developer community as a support resource Freedom and flexibility to take the preferred path towards a solution without rigid obstacles Ability to easily gather relevant technical information related to code failure Clear and explicit error messages that explain issues and suggest potential solutions Automatic resolution of tedious automatable tasks Reusable infrastructure to easily build ad-hoc solutions Availability of specialized tools for domain-specific problems (local environments, programming editors, debuggers, etc) Fast performance  Developers are empowered to meet their objectives with a high degree of comfort and efficiency when there are high-quality resources available, well-designed architectures with APIs that get out of the way, and insightful tooling functionalities to address domain-specific problems. When the basic tenets of developer experience aren\u2019t met, developers feel frustrated and suffer significantly lower productivity.  Ethereum developer experience  When it comes to Ethereum, which is primarily a software development platform to build decentralized systems, developer experience is a key strategic aspect for success. Ecosystem growth requires more developers to build more software on top of Ethereum. Developer adoption and learning speed, core contributors to this growth, are critically affected by developer experience. The rate at which the ecosystem innovates, coming up with new creations and solving difficult problems, both at the dapp layer and EVM/Solidity/Vyper layer, is also directly affected by developer productivity. Software development platforms aren\u2019t new, and playbooks established by the great developer experience success stories (Rust, .Net, TypeScript, etc) prove that achieving a quality developer experience requires a specialized approach paired with a long-term, big-picture strategy. The potential impact in executing a dedicated effort for Ethereum would increase the ecosystem\u2019s pace of innovation and growth, building a powerful compounding effect over the long term for the entire industry. The inspiration for our vision came from our experience building Hardhat, which allowed us to see how deeply challenging it is to build sophisticated Ethereum tooling. These challenges must be alleviated to bring about organic ecosystem-led improvement of developer experience that achieves world-class quality.  Nomic Foundation  Nomic Labs has been fully dedicated to Ethereum developer experience since 2019, and we\u2019re now pivoting to a non-profit foundation formally dedicated to Ethereum. We\u2019re aiming to build a long-lasting organization that makes Ethereum\u2019s public goods support structures stronger by contributing to the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s existing efforts, and reducing the ecosystem\u2019s reliance on any one organization for development platform components.  Roadmap  Given the size and innovation pace of the ecosystem, there\u2019s no way to foresee exactly what needs developers are going to have as things scale. However, we do know what engineering foundations the ecosystem will need in order to build its own solutions. Our overarching engineering strategy is to empower the ecosystem to build its own specialized tools. This plan is based on four strategic pillars of the stack, each of which offers an opportunity to leverage a platform to empower the ecosystem to keep building open-source infrastructure. For each of these pillars, we will build a platform. The four ecosystem pillars and platform opportunities we\u2019ve identified are:  Solidity EVM tooling Local development environment Ethereum connector library   The projects   Slang & Rethnet  Over the long term, these are our most important projects. Targeting the Solidity and EVM tooling pillars, Slang and Rethnet will serve as core infrastructure for the ecosystem to build new tools faster, cheaper, and better. We\u2019re essentially building the tools that would have let us build Hardhat a lot faster. We previously published a Medium post with high-level descriptions of how both projects will complement each other. Slang A Solidity compiler designed as a platform for tooling development, an approach also known as compiler as a service. Its top priority will be servicing tools through domain-specific APIs. Much like .Net\u2019s Roslyn, it will feature a compilation pipeline made of distinct reusable components with standalone APIs. A completely modular design guarantees that others can build on top of it by replacing the part of functionality they need to, and reusing everything else:  Parser that is only concerned with producing trees from code. Usable on its own, for example, to create third-party formatters like Prettier plugins. Semantic analysis (binding) is concerned only with building a type system and validating the produced trees. Usable on its own, to implement third-party type checking, security/threat models, and more advanced third-party linting. Code generation. By replacing just this isolated part, the compiler can compile for different targets (e.g. non-EVM L2s). Language services. These will receive an immutable representation of the above (syntax trees, bound trees, codegen settings), and will only be tasked with answering questions. Usable on its own to expose in different IDEs (same service for VSCode, IntelliJ, Vim, etc). Reusable to extend the functionality of other editor features (task runners, testing, deployment, CI, debugging). Runtime observation APIs to support Rethnet.  All of this will be reusable to create entirely new EVM programming languages, since by replacing the parser and type system, one can get an entire high-quality toolchain working from the get-go. Rethnet To provide a simulated environment where developers can build and test their Ethereum software, tools need to replicate many of the components that make up a full Ethereum node implementation. This is a significant engineering effort, which given the complexity of Ethereum, represents a barrier to entry to tooling development given the depth of knowledge that is required. Rethnet aims to make this easier by offering a native, flexible, extensible, fast, and language-agnostic EVM local development network, distributed as a Rust library, that is designed to be the underlying core in tools that provide debugging information to developers (like Hardhat, Foundry, Remix, Truffle, DappTools, etc). It will be a Rust library made to be consumed from other languages like TypeScript, Go, Python, etc as a native dependency. It will implement the baseline of essential functionality every tool should have like Solidity console.log, stack traces, and descriptive error messages, as well as implement code coverage, gas profiling, and a step debugger. At its core, it\u2019s an implementation of an Ethereum node with a layer of EVM runtime observation to provide development features. Building a new Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, or DappTools using Rethnet will be a much more manageable project, and Rethnet will be completely reusable for any EVM language through adapters.  Hardhat  Our flagship project targets the local development environment pillar, and it\u2019s currently at an advanced level of progress and adoption. While Slang and Rethnet mature and catalyze organic growth in the tooling space, developers still have needs to be met, positioning Hardhat as our immediate-term solution to empower developers to keep decentralizing the world. Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment that developers use to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software. Most importantly, it\u2019s highly flexible, extensible, and designed to empower the community to build their own solutions. This strategy has been successful, and there\u2019s already a valuable ecosystem of reusable plugins. Hardhat\u2019s roadmap is focused on becoming an extensible development environment with deep integrations across components in key areas of the tooling stack:   Hardhat VSCode \u2014 programming editor  Hardhat Ignition \u2014 contract deployment  Hardhat Network \u2014 local development network  Hardhat Runner \u2014 build/testing workflow  This roadmap leads to developers being well equipped to build powerful extensions to their workflow that increase their productivity according to their exact needs, and to then share them with the ecosystem in the form of plugins. Hardhat will also eventually migrate to using Rethnet and Slang, increasing its feature richness, speed, and stability while enabling dogfooding at scale for our brand new building blocks.  Web3.js as a frontend platform  The OG Ethereum connector library, Web3.js, is being revitalized into a high-value project. By focusing on community and ecosystem growth, supported by an extensible architecture, it can become a great source of value, much like React represents in the front-end world, but for dapps. A website hub connecting community spaces, support spaces, educational resources, extensions, and related projects, combined with an active ecodev effort (workshops, talks, contests, and incentives), will create a source of leverage for the ecosystem. This will provide better troubleshooting, faster developer training, more reusable code, and, most importantly, the possibility of extending the library. This effort is currently spearheaded by the ChainSafe team.  Funding  The Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we\u2019re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it. The Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we\u2019re aiming to raise $15M more.  Why Uniswap?  Generally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we\u2019ve approached and will continue approaching several protocols. Currently, Uniswap is built using Hardhat. While this is a signal of Hardhat\u2019s value, the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap, but for the entire ecosystem. We\u2019ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:  Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat). Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.  We believe this grows the market for everyone, including Uniswap, and we\u2019d love to have the Uniswap DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort .  An ecosystem-wide effort  We\u2019re currently seeking funding from multiple DAOs. We\u2019ll update with the corresponding links below as we create each forum thread.
