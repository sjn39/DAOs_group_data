For a non-grant proposal to proceed to Week 4, four delegates, each with >0.5% of the current votable token supply, must give explicit approval on the discussion thread. Delegates may not approve their own proposals. After a non-grant proposal has received four delegate approvals, the proposal author should update the proposal title from [Draft] to [Final] and add a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle Roundup thread by the last day of Week 3 at 19:00 GMT (12:00p PST). A snapshot of delegate voting weights will be taken at the start of the vote window. Voting will take place via the Optimism Governance Portal during Week 4 of the Cycle.
