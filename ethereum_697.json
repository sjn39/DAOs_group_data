It will help us to have more focused and prepared discussion. This thread is aimed to be an implication summary discussed in Potential security implications of CREATE2? (EIP-1014). I am starting the list: Our Social Contract on Immutability:   Immutable References: In our communication we consider contract address as a sufficient and immutable reference to immutable object. We don\u2019t use contract revisions or block ranges additionally to contract address to refer to particular contract mutation.   We follow \u201cAudit once - Trust many\u201d paradigm. Regular contract audits are not necessary because of assumed immutability of deployed contract. There are two exceptions: Hard Forks and Declared mutability of dependencies.   Hard Forks are considered to be impossible to fulfill in hidden without a publicly well-known announcement. This announcement allows to re-audit implication of the hard fork for particular contract in advance.   A Declared mutability of dependencies is a ability to replace a particular contract in the bundle. \u201cUpgradable proxied Contracts\u201d is a good example. This kind of mutability should be recognized by first audit. Anyway, a particular contract assumed to remain immutable. It is assumed to be impossible to introduce any unexpected mutability later.   ///please continue///   @jpitts: can I make this post to Wiki? ",
