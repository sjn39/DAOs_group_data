Seems like there was no ICO and tokens were given to a few people, also there wasn\u2019t any airdrop for the users. Right now MKR distribution is very concentrated and that won\u2019t change ever because there are no more tokens to mint either. So how is this decision fair at all? You should have had an ICO or at least an airdrop to have better distribution of power. This will at best become a protocol controlled by 30-40 people in the future, convince me otherwise. ",

Today, there are 80k holders: https://etherscan.io/token/0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2 In other words, in the last 3 years, we had a 20x growth in MKR holders.

No because most of the supply is still held by initial private investors.

So what is your actual question, if you already have, as it seems, a clear answer in your mind? In any case, note that what you call \u201cinitial private investors\u201d are actually largely the people who built MakerDAO. They did work, and it is just fair and normal that they have a large share of MKR. As a normal user and small MKR holder, who has been following this project for the last 3 years, I can tell you that your voice will be heard here, even if you have 0 MKR, as long as you discuss politely in the forum and have something meaningful to say.

It\u2019s not that different in the end and if anything, Maker is better than SNX and Aave and only marginally worse than Yearn by this metric. The claim that people who don\u2019t hold MKR don\u2019t get a say pretty easy to disprove. The largest delegate in the protocol is @PaperImperium who holds less than 5 MKR. Let me also say something about me. I\u2019ve started to get involved with Maker over the last six months and the only thing that stops me from contributing more to the protocol\u2019s direction is my lack of time, not my lack of MKR.

This is an interesting observation Sasa\u2013Liquidity Mining can also get tokens in the hands of Whales\u2013but it can also diversify the number of token owners. It can also inspire folks to participate in Governance, or to delegate to Delegates while earning rewards. Another interesting Liquidity Mining incentive that I have yet to see in Crypto is LM for Core Contributors, like Core Unit members and Community folks like you. We do have SourceCred which can be considered a Liquidity Mining tool. I suggest you join it and mine some DAI   ",
