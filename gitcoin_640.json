                    "content": "The objective of this post is to articulate how ImpactDAOS on Ethereum could scale to support all different types of public goods. I envision a Public Goods Rebel Alliance that grows to build, fund, and maintain all sorts of public goods.  Such an alliance would be a pluralistic, global, decoupled, & decentralized public goods funding juggernaut (as opposed to our legacy infrastructure which is comprised of (1) nation-state governments which is highly coupled + only serves the public goods of its citizens & (2) NGOs, which are high administrative overhead and generally dependent upon large donors ). I believe that the internet of money is the fundamental paradigm shift that enables the creation of this infrastructure.  Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 9.26.45 AM2804\u00d7688 63.2 KB  Just as anything that relied upon information was deeply changed by the original internet, I believe that the internet of money will enable a deep structural change in how value transfer occurs in society.  While most of the digital asset market is focused on banking (DeFi) and art (NFTs), I remain focused on long tail use cases like The Internet of Jobs and digital public goods. We are early.  I do not have all of the questions answered and do not claim to.  Instead, this post is merely a sketch of how I see several pieces of scaffolding coming together.  Vision: A Pluralistic Civilizational Scale Infrastructure for funding Public Goods There are existential risks that the nation-state public good architecture is not well set up to handle.   Climate change is a global existential risk that is not bounded to any nation.  Misinformation is a global existential risk that is not bounded to any nation.  Underfunded Digital Infrastructure  is a global existential risk that is not bounded to any nation. There are many many others: nuclear proliferation, environmental risks like deforestation or pollution, resource shortages, etc.  These challenges are what keep me coming back to work on these problems.  On a very deep level, I don\u2019t want to live in a world where these challenges dominate my life or the lifes of my loved ones.  Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 8.37.15 AM1920\u00d71200 71.3 KB  We should provide an infrastructure that is global in scope, which can address these unmet challenges. But how? This is why I think that programmable blockchains, especially Ethereum are so important.  They are a meaningful, incorruptible, programmable, substrate for global coordination.   And because they have got the future of finance riding on their rails, they could be incredibly powerful.  Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 8.34.59 AM1920\u00d71200 92.5 KB  There are many meaningful things happening on blockchain systems that are worthy of our time and attention, but my focal point for this discussion is on DAOs.  DAOs, for the purpose of this post, I will define broadly as \u201cdigital organizations\u201d.  They are a group of people with a shared bank account and shared purpose. There are 100s of DAOs out there and many many different sub-types of DAOs.  A particular type of DAO that I think is interesting and important is an ImpactDAO.  An ImpactDAO is any DAO that provides a positive externality, especially positive externalities for the public (not captured by any group). I believe that these ImpactDAOs are the fundamental atomic building block for the movement towards supporting digital public goods.  Towards a Pluralistic Civilizational Scale Infrastructure for funding Public Goods. Some examples of ImpactDAOs:   Proof Of Humanity creates the public good of more sybil resistance, which could usher in a world of one-human-one-vote digital democracy.  KlimaDAO creates the public goods of funding for those doing important carbon capture work.  GitcoinDAO creates the public good of funding for other public goods. There are many more examples, these are just a few.   Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 10.36.29 AM2880\u00d71800 295 KB  What I think is interesting about these ImpactDAOs can stack upon each other.  For example, an ImpactDAO for funding carbon credits, relies on our Ethereum infrastructure, which relies upon our broader digital infrastructure.  Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 8.35.24 AM2880\u00d71800 381 KB  And it is upon this insight that we build our stack of an unbundled public goods funding infrastructure. If you as a developer who is working on an ImpactDAO can focus on your own discrete mission, you can  create positive externalities to the world. create positive externalities up the ImpactDAO stack, especially to projects that rely upon you. benefit from positive externalities down the ImpactDAO stack.   Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 8.35.30 AM1920\u00d71200 115 KB  This isnt merely hypothetical.  Gitcoin has delivered $50mm in public goods funding so far.  In Gitcoin Grants Round 12, we begun to expand upon our side rounds strategy.  GR12 contained.  a main Ethereum round for funding Ethereum public goods an advocacy round for funding digital advocacy projects. a longevity round for funding life longevity projects. a climate round for funding life climate change projects. several rounds for adjacent ecosystems to fund their public goods: Forefront, Polygon, Uniswap, Zk Privacy, etc\u2026  What i think is super cool about this is how the Quadratic Funding Matching can stack when a grant is in multiple rounds.  If a $1 donation would generate a $75 matching donation for a grant in the main pool, then the same grant in 3 pools could have a $1 donation generate a $500 matching donation. This in fact did happen for Coin Center during GR12.  The matching multiple was so good that the twitterati though it was too good to be true.  This is an extremely powerful primitive!  If each QF matching pool is like a fan, then the combination of several matching pools together is like a jet engine!  Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 8.35.37 AM2880\u00d71800 283 KB  Of course, Quadratic Funding is not the only game in town.  Nor should it be. I do not think this post would be legitimate if I was not advocating for a Pluralistic  Infrastructure for funding Public Goods. Just as ETH2 client diversity is important, I believe that public goods funding mechanism diversity is important too! So lets talk about the ingredients that make ImpactDAOs legitimate and meaningful.  I am of the belief that there are two main ingredients.  a funding source and a mechanism for allocating attention and resources to places where they have impact.   Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 8.49.39 AM1920\u00d71200 80.1 KB  There are many meaningful ImpactDAOs out there that provide mechanisms for creating impact.  Some of the ones I\u2019m most excited about are noted in the slides below (but there are many many more!)  Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 8.35.45 AM2880\u00d71800 360 KB  Zooming back out - when we return to our view of how public goods can stack, let us note the diversity of mechanisms and funding sources that can make up a cluster of ImpactDAOs.  Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 8.35.51 AM2880\u00d71800 275 KB  Zooming further out, let us again note that we are all standing on the shoulders of giants.  Dozens of diverse ImpactDAOs standing upon each other are greater than the whole of their composite parts.  Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 8.35.30 AM1920\u00d71200 115 KB  From here, we can begin to sketch an architecture of how our nascent Ethereum-based public good can begin to scale to a pluralistic civilizational scale public goods funding infrastructure. As Marc Andresson once said, \u201cSoftware is eating the world\u201d.    In a world increasingly intermediated by (and coordinated by) software, this is a tailwind for deploying a novel & foundational infrastructure for funding public goods to the world. With these tailwinds, we can begin to think about how Ethereum-based public goods, which are starting to generate a lot of heat, could begin to expand to positively affect things outside of our nascent ecosystem.  Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 8.35.58 AM2880\u00d71800 287 KB  Because of how these ImpactDAOs stack and force multiply (remember - one QF round is like a fan, many is like a jet engine), and because each ImpactDAO is forkable to be used in different domains,  we begin can to envision how ImpactDAOs could proliferate to traditional OSS, to all digital projects, and possibly to impact the global scale public goods problems we noted in the beginning.  Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 8.36.04 AM2880\u00d71800 298 KB   Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 8.36.16 AM2880\u00d71800 318 KB  Of course, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t note that this is a future that we collectively have to choose.  The market will decide if it cares about ImpactDAOs or not.  Perhaps the market will choose that it only cares about Degen type use cases. All coordination is a choice.  We have to choose this future, not only in the types of assets we support in our financial lifes, but also in where we put our scarce time, attention, and skills. My goal with writing this post (and with much of the other work Gitcoin is doing) is to create a stigmergic feedback loop which helps to increase the chances of addressing the challenges outlined at the top of the post\u2026  Screen Shot 2021-12-24 at 8.36.23 AM1920\u00d71200 109 KB  I envision a web-scale public goods funding infrastructure replacing some of the places where nation states are receding in their support for public goods (or were never good at supporting public goods in the first place). in the old world, public goods were oriented around nation state. in the new world, they\u2019ll be based upon your online niche/community you belong to. were in the middle of a great re-indexing from nation-states to niches. niches are the new nation-states insofar as as this public goods funding spreads outward, niches (not geography) will be the aqueduct that carries the liquidity outward to the world.  I want to end on a pragmatic note, and acknowledge to you that there are risks and other unsolved problems here. I don\u2019t exactly have this all figured out yet, but I am only to provide a scaffold of an architecture that could begin to solve these problems. Here are some problems/risks I think we should be mindful of.  You should be wary of any charismatic leader who claims to have the answers, including myself.  Do your own research, form your own opinions, ask the hard questions.  Do not accept arguments from authority. How we make collective decisions to value these problems and the solutions to them is an extremely high order bit.  How does a market of participants decide to value climate action vs digital infrastructure vs fighting misinformation?  I am worried that markets of participants follow things that are lower in the brainstem (charismatic leaders, memes, and brands) moreso than rationalist things like fundamentals. We are awash in mechanisms to organize attention & financial resources (like Quadratic Funding), but we do not yet have sustainable financial resources to fund ImpactDAOs. I know this challenge first hand as I hustle ever quarter to get more capital into the Gitcoin Grants matching pools.  Maybe one day nation-state governments will realize these ImpactDAOs are more effective and lower overhead than their predecessors and take revenues from taxation and put them into these mechanisms.  But until that day I will continue to hustle. I worry a lot about The Matthew Effect, the fundamental law of economic systems that says that the \u201crich get richer\u201d.  We need to find a way to defy this law of economic systems lest this infrastructure become captured by the elite, just like the infrastructure that preceded it was. To a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  To an Blockchain Developer, everything looks like a problem money can solve.  I think we should be mindful that there is meaningful organic local action happening in many niches, and our job is to play a supporting role in amplifying the impact of these local leaders.  The financial system is a enabling channel for greater combinations of strength/intelligence to arise, not an end in itself. Many of the existing mechanisms are Keynesian beauty contests.  Mechanisms which are not Keynesian beauty contests will be important components of this infrastructure. What did I miss? feel free to add constructive critique of this piece in the comments.  ",

                    "content": "Hey Kevin, great post.  I have a lot of thoughts about what you\u2019ve shared, but I think before I get into them, since I\u2019m new here, it\u2019s worth mentioning that I\u2019m a Musician and Film maker first and foremost who just happens to have a deep passion for the ideas of decentralization. Right now, I find myself agreeing with everything you\u2019ve outlined in your vision here, but I do think you shouldn\u2019t be too quick to write off NFTs in the art portions of the crypto space.  Reason being, is that part of me believes that there is some potential in combining what they\u2019re bringing to the table, with what you\u2019re bringing to the table. Because of this belief, the idea of DAO alliances is something that I find really compelling and have actually already been thinking about lately, though, mostly from the opposite perspective. AKA- How to kickstart an art DAO that generates enough revenue so that it can send royalties to projects like Gitcoin or other DAOs that are similarly focused on funding Public Goods. Art DAOs are obviously very very fresh to this world of Crypto and are inspiring an immense amount of hype (as well as money). But, I think what they currently lack is the proper infrastructure tools to become extremely large and more than that, I think they\u2019re lacking some sort of tangible externally facing goods that could potentially bring in a very decent amount of revenue. Right now, I\u2019m working with a small group of people to kickstart a DAO (which I will leave unnamed since I\u2019m more-so here to bounce ideas), and I am currently stewing on this idea representing memberships via Harberger Taxed NFTs.  Otherwise known as SALSA/Cost.  My theory is that if an ArtDAO manages to build out some of the tooling/infrastructure where access to the community and community resources is token gated via Harberger Taxed NFTs, the DAO can potentially drive a tremendous amount of revenue to their treasury. This treasury then going on to fund more art which increases it\u2019s asset pool by which it can then create a demand with and drive NFT taxed Memberships. What I find more interesting in this idea, is that like software, art is limitless and it\u2019s a thing that people are creating endlessly for free already. So by building a community and collectivizing the ownership of the art, whether it be film, music, paintings, writings, you are creating a giant pile of assets that will generate royalties for as long as there are people to consume it. I\u2019ll even go as far as to say that, maybe art is  a public good and should be treated as such. When you do that, you can potentially flip your Keynesian beauty contest on its head and raise funds through a multitude of ArtDAOs that are streaming revenue to the larger alliance of ImpactDAOs. Make the fun stuff and let that fun stuff drive the funding for deeper public works?  If this is something that seems possible, it needs to happen as soon as possible so a cultural precedent can be set that furthers this movement of Public Goods Funding mechanisms. note- if this is super in the wrong lane, let me know.  But I do believe that in the same way there is interdependence with people there is also interdependence in markets. ",

                    "content": "Kevin, There\u2019s a lot to love about your vision and obviously I am a huge fan of it.  I hope GitCoin will become one of the most important models in the world for coordination and I hope to be there right along side you helping you figure it out. In that spirit of supporting you all, I think there are some key things about the best (most socially beneficial, most scalable and most profitable) business model for GitCoin that this post doesn\u2019t do a great job of capturing.  It runs to the core of the post, because it relates to the way that it misses the essence of plurality and what it means to relate as a part of a plural infrastructure. I think this arises from falling into certain conceptual traps that are very common in the blockchain world and that I hope you can move beyond to achieve your ambitions. Let me start by trying to illustrate why I don\u2019t think the vision literally as you sketched is realistic or desirable.  Then I\u2019ll turn to a trajectory that makes more sense and try to sketch how the technology and business strategy needs to evolve to follow that trajectory. Let\u2019s imagine that we tried to run QF/GitCoin on a truly global scale based on an open PoH identity system.  Let\u2019s divide how this could play out into a few cases:  You manage to get a large chunk (let\u2019s say 50%) of the world population actively participating.  In this case, it seems very likely that there will be at least public good (say related to climate) that will get at least a $1 contribution from at least (say) a billion people, given that even without matching some disasters have elicited responses of this magnitude.  QF \u201cwants\u201d to match this will a quintillion (10^18) dollars, so even if you had a constrained multiplier of 1/10,000, you\u2019d still need to raise more money than all of global GDP to do this, and in the process you\u2019d end up with a multiplier that made matching basically useless to any normal cause.  In short, a global QF process is simply infeasible. Furthermore, even if you managed to somehow make the math compute and get control of most of the world\u2019s resources (neither of which seems desirable or feasible), the allocation of these resources would almost certainly be decided by which existing organizations in the world have the greatest combination of coercive power and internalized solidarity\u2026China, for example, which has much higher social cohesion that liberal democracies and more surveillance powers would almost certainly manage to an order of magnitude more contributors and an order of magnitude higher contributions to any cause it favored, capturing essentially all matching funds.  Now, in principle one could imagine policing such \u201ccollusion\u201d, and I\u2019ll return to this below, but given the sheer array of potentially \u201ccolluding\u201d groups in the world, doing this by hand rather than by basic changes to the architecture of QF would force GitCoin to become precisely the kind of centralized surveillance state it abhors.  And hoping for a world without organizations of solidarity other than through QF seems both entirely vain and deeply contrary to a spirit of pluralism that seeks to build on the accomplishment of existing means of coordination, not replace all of them. You don\u2019t managed to get a large chunk participating (say less than 1%).  In this case, Proof of Humanity is of almost no use in deterring Sybil attacks.  While it ensures each person gets only one vote, 99% of the planet is available to be recruited by an actual participant to create an effective fake account for them.  One would then be stuck with either a ridiculously small matching pool that wouldn\u2019t attract such attacks or being sucked dry by Sybil attacks. You\u2019re in the 1-50% range. In this intermediate range you\u2019d end up with a mix of the first two problems. In short, the basic set up of QF/GitCoin cannot and should not scale in an open, PoH based way globally.  This doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t something awesome going on here that should scale, and I\u2019ll return to it soon.  But it does mean something quite a bit stronger than the first reaction a lot of the audience here is likely to have: These issues are not a result of a flaw in QF as a solution to the decentralized public goods framed as coordinating individual self-interest towards common goods.  QF is the optimal solution here and anything else based on the same open, PoH, individualistic thinking is going to run into the same mix of problems: either it will be too weak to do much, be open to Sybil attacks or eat up the whole world/be controlled by existing coordination mechanisms. In fact, these issues apply, albeit in somewhat less extreme forms, to other applications of PoH.  Let me give two examples.  If you try to do validation by PoH, either you are going to need like 50% of the world running validation nodes, which seems wildly unrealistic, or you\u2019re going to be open to Sybil attacks by people recruiting large numbers of those who aren\u2019t currently running nodes.  If you try to do UBI by PoH, either you\u2019re going to need a large chunk of global GDP and/or the payments are going to be so small they will only make a difference in the lives of the poorest people on earth, who anyway are extremely likely to be subject to some form of coercion or unable to access their PoH-based account in the first place.  The open PoH approach makes it impossible to, as other UBI studies have done, target some local community with large UBIs without requiring control over a large fraction of global resources. What\u2019s going wrong here and what does it tell us about how to do things better?  Fundamentally, the framing of the problem is missing a key element.  It assumes that it finds individuals in an atomized state, caring only about their individual self-interest, without any institutions that can help solve free rider/public goods problems.  It then provides incentives to overcome these.  Yet, if we really lived in a world like this, civilization would pretty much not exist and we\u2019d be in a Hobbesian war of each against all.  Thankfully we don\u2019t; there are a range of institutions (yes, I used that taboo word) at a range of scales, both formal (like governments, unions, corporations, etc.) and informal (like feelings of patriotism, altruism, kin ties, racial solidarity, etc.) that avoid this outcome, and there always have been from the dawn of humanity.  Because these institutions exist, the problem of coordinating a billion people is not really a million times harder than the problem of coordinating a thousand people, as the atomized QF approach assumes.  It is probably closer to being on logarithmic scale (say 6 times harder). Now you can think what you will of these institutions and how well they perform their assigned roles and I know that most in this community will tend to dismiss them out of hand.  But even if you don\u2019t love them, you cannot ignore them for three reasons: Practical: Even if you don\u2019t like these institutions, there\u2019s little to no chance they are going to completely disappear soon enough that GitCoin and other things in the Web 3 space can safely ignore the impacts they have on behavior.  If you do, you are simply solving the wrong problem, potentially with catastrophic effects as noted above. Ethical: It would be the height of arrogance to imagine that we are confident QF or any other Web 3 mechanism will always and everywhere lead to better coordination than these existing institutions without even experimenting with them significantly.  Thus, we should not want to wipe out these other institutions, if ever, at least until we\u2019ve had a chance to play with these mechanisms in a range of setting of increasing ambition.  But as we do, we had also better hope these existing institutions don\u2019t collapse, or we\u2019ll end up in Mad Max along the way.  Thus, we must plan to coexist and even cooperate with them, not for the world after they disappear.  And if you really believe in pluralism like you suggest, that pluralism should be far broader than just \u201cother stuff floating around the blockchain ecosystem\u201d\u2026there are more things in Heven and Earth, Kevin, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. Stability: Even if, somehow, you did end up in a world where all other institutions disappeared and QF ran everything, you wouldn\u2019t stay there long.  The whole point of QF is to form cooperative communities.  And one of the most reliable features of human social psychology is the tendency to form bons of affection and solidarity with those you engage in a common project with.  So the minute you start running QF, you will see \u201cinstitutions\u201d form, as a result of the mechanism itself, and these will then undermine the operation of QF as noted above. Ok, so, Mr. Gloomy Face, riddle me this: how has QF/GitCoin not turned into a disaster so far?  And is there any path to scaling it successfully? I would submit that the success of GitCoin so far has been largely due to the mismatch between the way this post imagines GitCoin and the way it operates in practice.  It is not really a global open system.  Instead, it has operates in specific communities, of similar scales, that roughly approximate the members thereof having nearly symmetrical social distance and the administrator having sufficient knowledge of the community structure to use various bespoke mechanisms to police \u201ccollusion\u201d (viz. solidarity outside the mechanism), as well as potential Sybil attacks not just in terms of non-humans, but also people who don\u2019t belong in the community and are being roped in just to help someone win. But while this closes one avenue for growth for GitCoin, I think it opens another that is even more exciting.  All around the world there are organizations and institutions like those mentioned above that a) want to see a better, more responsive and dynamic provision of public goods within them, b) lack information about which goods have the greatest value and c) know quite a bit about social structure internally which would allow them to police the way GitCoin has in the domains it knows.  A natural business model is to create a 3-sided market between donors, sponsors and projects within a range of these institutions to strengthen them rather than replace them.  For example, most companies have major problems with different divisions with diverse objectives and KPIs failing to provide common infrastructure that supports the company wholistically (my office at Microsoft largely exists for this reason).  If QF could be thoughtfully applied, say, to representatives of these divisions, it could surface the needs for shared infrastructure. Does any of this require or even comport very well with a blockchain?  Not particularly.  Given that the intention is not to have something that is global or open even in the PoH sense, where identity is deeply bound to community and most naturally to accounts that the company has already, the overhead associated with blockchains doesn\u2019t seem to be a very good fit.  But, at some level, who cares: you have a great business model that can do all kinds of good.  Don\u2019t get overly committed to a particular tech stack. Now, eventually, you should want to go beyond these specific applications to specific communities if you can get them to work; you should seek, say, local or state governments that want to subsidize the creation of public goods across local communities, companies, etc. within the locality or state.  These somewhat larger entities will have some read on community structure, but probably a not to easily directly police issues around collusion, participation, fake accounts etc.  So, you will want algorithmic structure to help do all this. But the basics of QF won\u2019t even come close to getting you there.  First, PoH won\u2019t do much to police the boundaries of participants, as the community will be a tiny fraction of the world and you\u2019ll need some \u201cproof of community/membership/authority\u201d.  Second and even more importantly, membership of that community won\u2019t be the primary thing you want to track anyway\u2026you\u2019ll want to be able to reduce matching for common projects between those who already are coordinating: those in the same companies, same ethnic group, same religion, etc.  But even with PoH or something of that sort, you\u2019re not going to get rich community information like that and algorithms to run on it.  That\u2019s a big step from where we are.  I have an essay (\u201cWhy I am a Pluralist\u201d) coming out soon about how it might all work in open standards, and my piece on the RxC blog on Intersectional Social Data hints at it.  But it would certainly be as big a break from the current \u201cWeb 3 ecosystem\u201d as that is from Web 1, Web 2 or perhaps even pre-internet world. Perhaps this all sounds a bit daunting\u2026perhaps it is.  But it is also exciting and suggests that GitCoin and the space it is cracking the door of is even more important and ambitious than you suspect.  I truly believe this type of thinking can transform and empower every person and organization on the planet, that it is core to our future and that we\u2019ve just started to imagine how it might all work.  Think, for example, of how we can do QF over time with those alive now, those that have died and those that will live in the future to address the long-term future of humanity? You\u2019ve got the Apple IIc.  It portends a revolution.  But not far down the road are the GUI, the internet, mobile computing, etc.  Keep and open mind.  Not all the answers are even imaginable now.  But if you do, GitCoin has a real chance to change the world.  Best, Glen ",

UBI also might not be universal to all identity holders (at least not in the level of compensation). i think context here is also massively important. UBI payouts from a pool of money for something specific (like FDD in gitcoin) and relative to those who contribute the most (with a fair measure) only makes sense. but that\u2019s why opt-in communities is where this type of thing will find its home \u2014 it will emerge. not be forced as a \u201chere\u2019s a perfect solution, now use it\u201d (ie. what non-opt-in systems like governments/municipalities/etc. provide).

Then I\u2019ll turn to a trajectory that makes more sense and try to sketch how the technology and business strategy needs to evolve to follow that trajectory.   Thanks for coming by to comment Glen!  Thankful to you for the original QF paper + the continued dialogue about its implemented + excited to read your critique      GlenWeyl:  Furthermore, even if you managed to somehow make the math compute   Right now we are using Pairwise QF which scales O(n^2).  We are already having scaling issues with computing it.  cc @gdixon     GlenWeyl:  the allocation of these resources would almost certainly be decided by which existing organizations in the world have the greatest combination of coercive power and internalized solidarity\u2026China, for example, which has much higher social cohesion that liberal democracies and more surveillance powers would almost certainly manage to an order of magnitude       GlenWeyl:  of the planet is available to be recruited by an actual participant to create an effective fake account for them.   it is an interesting, if depressing, point that at this type of scale, collusion is basically impossible to deter.     GlenWeyl:   PoH, individualistic thinking is going to run into the same mix of problems: either it will be too weak to do much, be open to Sybil attacks or eat up the whole world/be controlled by existing coordination mechanisms. In fact, these issues apply, albeit in somewhat less extreme forms, to other applications of    id\u2019 be curious what you think the optimal sybil resistence tool is. one idea we\u2019ve been toying with at Gitcoin is not betting too hard on one sybil resistence tool, instead trying to aggregate many of them - which allows for a pluralism of sybil resistence tools (and possibly force multiplication for users who verify with multiple mechanisms)     GlenWeyl:  he payments are going to be so small they will only make a difference in the lives of the poorest people on earth   this actually reminds me, and apologies, this is unrelated to your point in any way, but the grants rounds are actually already consolidating towards the top grants. this excellent graph by @Snowdot shows the trendline:  gtc61000\u00d7600 13.9 KB   gtc71000\u00d7600 13.3 KB  i am curious what you think of this trendline, and ways the mechanism could be tweaked to change it if it is undesirable.     GlenWeyl:  Yet, if we really lived in a world like this, civilization would pretty much not exist and we\u2019d be in a Hobbesian war of each against all.   I would agree that we are not in this state in the physical world; but I\u2019d be curious for your perspective on if the digital world looks like this in any way.  my own take: I dont see things like national pride, civic cuty, or common sense of awe & stewardship for humanity in the digital realm (yet), and i see lots of small scale warfare on social media, to large scale misinformation/hacking campaigns.  our digital institutions (FAANG companies, standards bodies like the w3c) are relative immature relative to our physical ones IMHO.     GlenWeyl:  Even if you don\u2019t like these institutions, there\u2019s little to no chance they are going to completely disappear soon enough that GitCoin and other things in the Web 3 space can safely ignore the impacts they have on behavior   i know that i am seen as a crypto person, and crypto people are famously soveirgn-individual-style bearish on institutions, but i should be explicitly clear that i do not view QF as a replacing existing institutions - only augmenting them.  in the digital world where there are less global public goods funding mechanisms, there is more blue ocean for Gitcoin Grants to grow.  and it is there that is our primary focus for the time being\u2026     GlenWeyl:  Thus, we must plan to coexist and even cooperate with them, not for the world after they disappear. And if you really believe in pluralism like you suggest, that pluralism should be far broader than just \u201cother stuff floating around the blockchain ecosystem\u201d   This is a great point.  Pluralism should extend not only to many web3-era mechanisms, but to many other types of institutions.  I know that you and I are both very inspired by what Audrey Tang, the digital minister of Taiwan is up to.  Perhaps that is a tangible example of this \u2013 though there are likely many others.     GlenWeyl:  So the minute you start running QF, you will see \u201cinstitutions\u201d form, as a result of the mechanism itself, and these will then undermine the operation of QF as noted above.   It is interesting to think of QF as a self-terminating system in this way.  eg. once it creates enough cooperation, the that cooperation naturally ossifies, and it turns to collusion.     GlenWeyl:  nearly symmetrical social distance   this reminds me, the theory of social distance you told me about ~ 6 months ago with respect to QF is fascinating, i bet the audience here (especially the Fraud Defense workstream) would get a kick out of it too.     GlenWeyl:  A natural business model is to create a 3-sided market between donors, sponsors and projects within a range of these institutions to strengthen them rather than replace them.   What a fascinating insight.  So in this world, we would be doing data analysis on the say, Ethereum ecosystem, and delivering insights back to the ecosystem steward (in this case, the Ethereum foundation) on the social structures of it\u2019s ecosystem?  cc @annika @kyle @lthrift - this reinforces my view that analytics is an underinvested area for us     GlenWeyl:  Does any of this require or even comport very well with a blockchain? Not particularly.   Blasphemy!   /s     GlenWeyl:  So, you will want algorithmic structure to help do all this   yes, we are already experimenting with graph analysis tools in order to understand these social graphs. cc @danlessa     GlenWeyl:  But if you do, GitCoin has a real chance to change the world.         M0nkeyFl0wer:  So in short we should focus on applying QF to a wide range of communities as opposed to taking a global approach.   interesting TLDR @M0nkeyFl0wer  ",
