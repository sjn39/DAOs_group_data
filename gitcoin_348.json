Origins of this initiative After GG Round 6, Gitcoin leaders reached out to BlockScience to engage in modelling and simulation work to examine the quadratic funding system for attack vectors, and how to defend them to create a more resilient system. That work opened the opportunity for a multi-disciplinary research initiative and discussions around the algorithmic governance design of the grants sybil and collusion-detection ecosystem. The research group was formed out of an #OpenScience collaboration between Gitcoin, BlockScience, Token Engineering Academy & Token Engineering Commons Labs, which ran an eight week study of grants data. You can read more in this notion library of the Co-Lab. This work will now be carried forward in this workstream, and will take the initiative through the next steps of the process - getting the stewards up to speed on the work that has been done so far, and empowering them with computer-aided policymaking tools. With these tools, they will provide critical feedback to help decide on appropriate boundaries and values in line with the Gitcoin community. Stewards will help to build appropriate governance processes and manage modifications, community feedback integration and other needs as they arise to improve fraud and collusion prevention. https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tMCD99s9TwlVFJgmb7vGG1riuhwGQOqO0tskWHtDnALl4YhuGmieMlBF7H0eTuQd-f8Q1B6EgEscdrC1rAT62I2YUGTSPLk7FFCOtZv4QfsTE250SSlym9NDGujTkoK7n4gq0AoZ(image larger than 4 MB) Exploring the data: Gitcoin Grants Round 7 on Kumu. Red nodes are donors, green nodes are grants.  Workstream Ops The workstream has two pipelines: 1. ML/Data Science 2. Governance Education The initial workstream team is made up of members of the BlockScience and Gitcoin teams, and stewards will be invited to participate. Danilo Lessa Bernardineli Disruption Joe, Gitcoin Dr. Michael Zargham Jeff Emmett Jessica Zartler Jesse Tao JiaJia H Kyle Weiss Scott Moore  The Rollout The two pipeline teams are working side by side to develop the technical frameworks and two educational workshops that will begin to further decentralize decision making in governance of gitcoin grants in relation to anti-fraud and collusion detection. There are several choices that need to be made i.e whether to tune the algorithm for sensitivity - to widen its scope (more false positives), or narrow its lens for specificity (less positives get flagged) and how to handle edge cases. For the process, we will work with sample data to see how this works in reality, and transition from \u201cthe spirit of the law\u201d to the \u201cletter of the law\u201d in application and policy making. We have sketched out the initial discovery process and what we will need to determine to get this initiative off the ground:  Define the mandate Education of Stewards First Policy Considerations Defining the appeals process Defining the sanctions process Establishing processes to modify the processes Defining KPIs and feedback loops Defining operations considerations   The Road Ahead  \u201cThe Boston #TE Party\u201d - #TokenEngineering Most algorithms that affect our lives are black boxed, and we have no say over the policy decisions or tuning of systems we engage with every day. This is among the first initiatives in history to empower collective decision making in computer-aided governance. The road ahead is long, and we are charting new territory, but together, with the light of knowledge and taking conscious steps, we can build towards a grants system of the people, by the people (with algorithmic assistance), and for the people.  960\u00d7540 28.2 KB   If you would like to answer the call and are interested in participating in this workstream, reply to this thread below with your interest and any related experience.

David brings up that there could be a score associated   if you\u2019d like to join the grants working group, you can message Jessica, see if you can make the commitment every 3 days, 30-60 minutes of async work reviewing grants   Jessica mentions how the block science team will be assisted by the data science team, fine tuning inputs, etc, etc.   ",

                    "content": "Greetings humans! I wanted to create a workstream on Moving to the price of forgery, but just noticed this one. Think it\u2019s better to publish here.  Moving to the price of forgery + turning gitcoin into identity provider.  Quality control of human verification methods (or the way we assign trust bonuses to verification methods) Systems like Proof of Humanity, Bright ID, Idena, POAP and ENS are already doing an amazing job in moving towards a no-bots future. Yet there\u2019s room for improvement. Which is better quality control and a fairer trust bonus for each method as a result. @Adamscochran proposed to create a standard assessment procedure for new (and existing) methods. The procedure is incredibly detailed and exhaustive. It can describe literally any existing verification method quantitatively. Yet as well as the current procedure it is\u2026 \u2026subjective. we cannot predict the ingenuity of malicious actors. There\u2019s no way we can think of all the exploits for a particular verification method. And there\u2019s no simple way we can tell the method was exploited. An exploited verification method + exploited quality control algorithm is a Trojan horse for a bot army. So the first problem is the high risk to be a step behind malicious actors. \u2026and speculative. See how @Adamscochran scored Idena. It is so low that Idena would be kicked out of the approved methods. I\u2019d disagree with that. I love Idena and most probably would propose a different scoring for it or probably would demand to reconsider weights in scoring parameters. But we cannot really determine which weights or scores are right. Thus the second problem is the lack of objective measurement. Without it, we leave room for political games, biased opinions, and unproductive disputes (same as disputes on religion, politics, vaccines;)).  How price of forgery works The solution to both of the problems described is the price of forgery concept. The main idea is that the user score is valued in dollars and the user can grab these dollars at any time. After that, the user\u2019s ID is deleted forever. The procedure is called \u201cexplosion\u201d in Upala terms (we invented the concept and building the protocol implementing it). I\u2019ll use the term further. With the price of forgery approach, we don\u2019t have to rely on any assumptions about any verification method. The market will drive the scoring of each method to its price of forgery organically. We also get an assurance for future exploits. If a method got hacked we would see it immediately through an increased explosion rate. That would mean the method should be fixed, or its score should be decreased.  See more on the price of forgery in this article on EthResearch  See what we are up to in Upala    How Gitcoin may benefit Price of forgery gives the ability to quality control human verification methods with market forces. It is unbiased, precise, and responsive to new exploits. For the verification methods It would mean:  Fairer trust bonuses Automated, transparent, and ongoing quality control Incentive for third parties to bring new verification methods or invent new ones  The benefits from shifting to the price of forgery go a bit further than \u201cjust\u201d quality control. Gitcoin has tremendous data on interactions on the platform. It is then possible to aggregate scores from multiple sources for a single user (which trust bonuses do), and also append an additional trust bonus to award \u201cproper\u201d internal interaction. That would benefit users and will help assess own algorithms (help understand better what the \u201cproper\u201d behavior is). And even further. With all that data and algorithms measured with the price of forgery Gitcoin may start providing its own digested scores to other DApps and earn on that (Upala protocol allows to do that). Due to the high user base, it may become a starting point for a decentralized identity system of the future.  Work done, next steps, and coordination You can track progress on developing the price of forgery protocol here (looking for contributors by the way - we\u2019ve got Ampere-hours!). I had a talk with @owocki about the price of forgery back in September 2020. Then described integration in this github issue. I learned recently that Gitcoin is continuing on the idea - thread. So seems like the Upala\u2019s price of forgery concept is already approved. Though I haven\u2019t had any conversation with the gitcoin team on this and I don\u2019t see any coordination. As Gitcoin is decentralized now I thought it is a good idea to start the discussion here.  Related topics:  [Workstream] Anti-Fraud Workstream Assemble!
