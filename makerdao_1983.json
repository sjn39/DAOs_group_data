                    "content": "The Oracle Core Unit has a large number of vests coming up that are in accordance with the formula ratified by Maker Governance in our budget proposal. The estimates given in the budget proposal were based on the MKR lock-in price of $1956. A price reset mechanism was introduced to fairly compensate contributors who joined at different points in time. For example you wouldn\u2019t want to incentive someone to quit because their MKR lock-in price was high when they joined, and instead give the benefit to a new member of the team who joined during a bear cycle. As is expected from resets, the estimate is no longer accurate and we are drawing above the previous estimate of 1100 MKR / year. Please keep in mind that in the first 12 months of the OCU only 609 MKR were spent, significantly less than the 1100 MKR estimate in the OCU budget. OCU is pulling 1285.58 MKR total. 441.89 MKR will come from the remainder in the previous budget year\u2019s stream that wasn\u2019t utilized. The remaining 843.69 MKR will be distributed from the most recent budget proposal in the following Executive Vote. ",
