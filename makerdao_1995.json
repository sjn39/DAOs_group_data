With our last budget proposal, SP84, rejected, we are winding down the Core Unit and formally proposing its offboarding. As detailed in the offboarding proposal, there are some administrative tasks that need to be completed in the month of January. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have any spend approved past the new year and we don\u2019t feel comfortable spending without some form of explicit approval from voters.  Our Ask We are asking governance to approve winddown spending that includes compensation for the facilitator during the month of January in addition to a few one-time expenses detailed in the offboarding proposal.  Facilitator Compensation for the month of January 2023. Service fees to AccountAble for the month of January 2023. Offboard fees to our payroll provider.  No transfer is necessary as we have excess funds available from our previous budget, just approval. This request will be going up as a governance poll on Monday, thank you GovAlpha! @Recognized-Delegates ",
