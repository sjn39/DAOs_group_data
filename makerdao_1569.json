Sentence Summary This budget proposes a MKR compensation for GovAlpha (GOV-001) with a vesting component (Q3 2022).  Paragraph Summary This proposal seeks the ranked choice vote on the following vesting allocations to GovAlpha contributors, covering MKR compensation for the Core Unit for the past 6 months. Subsequent requests will take place every 6 months, featuring the same 12-month cliff. Contributors do not forfeit their vesting upon leaving GovAlpha, provided that their departure is a smooth transition and there have been no serious ethical breaches. The table below represents the MKR amounts expressed in a lump sum and per Full-Time Equivalent worker per year:     Option MKR Total ~MKR/FTE/YEAR     200% Multiplier 330.27 153.61   150% Multiplier 247.70 115.21   100% Multiplier 165.14 76.81     Specification  Motivation MKR Vesting plays an important role in incentive alignment for Core Unit Members. By tying a meaningful element of compensation to the performance of the MKR Token, members of the Core Unit are further incentivized to be good stewards of the Protocol. GovAlpha continues to believe that our MKR compensation setup is ideally suited for our Core Unit and the DAO.  Specifically, we see these advantages with our proposed implementation:  More clarity on the amount of MKR being allocated (proposals are retroactive, based on already paid labor). Flexibility, as the parameters can be updated twice a year. A larger percentage of compensation in MKR, giving more alignment with protocol performance. Easier system for facilitators to administrate. Continues after contributors leave, keeping alignment even if a contributor is leaving the Core Unit/MakerDAO. Easier system for applying towards hourly employees, the majority of GovAlpha\u2019s workforce.   Core Unit ID GOV-001 (GovAlpha)  Budget Implementations  Current GovAlpha Member MKR Composition We are continuing with our program as defined in February and passed by the MKR holders in March of this year. The following definitions were used to determine our requested MKR amount: Eligibility Anyone currently working for GovAlpha, who has not given notice at the time of this proposal, is eligible for MKR Compensation. Future proposals will follow the same logic, ensuring that anyone working for the GovAlpha during our 6-month proposal cadence will be rewarded by this framework. Formula For all members of GovAlpha (Facilitators included), MKR Compensation will be derived based on the salary earned within the Core Unit during the retroactive eligibility period. This proposal would compensate our team members in MKR in the amount of either 100%, 150%, or 200% of the DAI earned during the eligibility period, as voted on by the MKR holders. This figure will be divided by the moving average of MKR over the eligibility period to derive the MKR token amount for each contributor. Sources Eligibility Period - This will be from February 8th, 2022 until August 1st, 2022 for this proposal. Please note this reflects a slight change from our last proposal, as SF-001 recommended that all vesting dates utilize the first of the month to make reporting and tracking more consistent. Salary - This will be derived from all contributor and Facilitator invoices paid by GovAlpha during the eligibility period. MKR Moving Average - Is derived from the \u201cClose\u201d price on CoinGecko (latest data point per day, UTC), taking the average closing price for that eligibility period. Lockup Eligible MKR compensation will have a cliff of 12 months, meaning GovAlpha contributors will receive their MKR one year after the end of the eligibility period. MKR Transfer For full transparency, GovAlpha Facilitators will have their MKR Compensation streamed through DssVest. The rest of the MKR budget will be streamed to the GovAlpha Multisig, 0x01D26f8c5cC009868A4BF66E268c17B057fF7A73, where it will be subsequently transferred to contributors. Note that a primary difference in our incentive model is that contributors retain the right to their MKR vesting even after leaving the Core Unit. This is to ensure a smooth transition. Only in the event of an ethical breach or failure to transition will a contributor lose their claim on their MKR vesting. Disclaimer Vested MKR for contributors will sit in the GovAlpha Multisig for a short period after the vesting cliff while administrative checks are performed before disbursing. GovAlpha will not use this MKR for voting or any other purpose during this time.  List of Budget Breakdowns  Dependencies Eligibility Period: February 8, 2022 - August 1, 2022 MKR Moving Average (spreadsheet) - $1,487.66 Salary inputs: @prose11 - 62,000 DAI @Patrick_J - 32,413.75 DAI Contributors - 151,248.52 DAI Note: The contributor figure is a bit deceiving due to @LongForWisdom stepping down from his facilitator role ~2 months before this proposal while staying on as a contributor.  MKR Payments Note these are presented in the CU preferred 200% setup, @MIP-Editors will be contacted with the revised number to edit based on the vote of MKR holders. @prose11 Facilitator Stream: 83.35 MKR streamed from the Pause Proxy to 0xbfDD0E744723192f7880493b66501253C34e1241 Starting 2022/08/01, Ending 2023/08/01, cliff 2023/08/01 @Patrick_J Facilitator Stream: 43.58 MKR streamed from the Pause Proxy to ** 0xbb147E995c9f159b93Da683dCa7893d6157199B9** Starting 2022/08/01, Ending 2023/08/01, cliff 2023/08/01 Core Unit Stream: 203.34 MKR streamed from the Pause Proxy to 0x01D26f8c5cC009868A4BF66E268c17B057fF7A73, Starting 2022/08/01, Ending 2023/08/01, cliff 2023/08/01  Budget Impact  Between 165.14 and 330.27 MKR will be committed to GovAlpha for MKR compensation, if an option is approved by MKR voters, for ~50% annual compensation (Feb. 8th - Aug 1st, 2022). This proposal accounts for 4.3 FTE based on hours worked, or between ~76.81 and ~153.61 MKR/FTE/Year. Future proposals will likely have a slightly higher FTE as the GovAlpha team has been expanding and FTE is based on total hours worked over the eligibility period. Note that we will repeat submissions roughly every 6 months. Our last proposal predicted a smaller package in terms of MKR this time around (we were approved for 227.64 MKR last time), but unfortunately, the 6-month moving average of MKR is less than half of what it was in February. Future proposals will likely be subject to similar volatility on the MKR price input.   Ratification Vote This MIP will draw from the MIP40 Amendments ratified structure for DAI budget requests. The vote for this proposal shall be Ranked Choice (IRV) format, featuring the following options: Option 1 (CU Preferred): 200% Multiplier Applied - 330.27 Total MKR Option 2: 150% Multiplier Applied - 247.70 Total MKR Option 3: 100% Multiplier Applied - 165.14 Total MKR Option 4: Reject MKR Vesting ",

We used the same formula we did six months ago, but the increase in CU capacity combined with the continued decline in MKR price over the past 6 months resulted in a far higher MKR/FTE/Year figure. We (GovAlpha) are of a couple of minds on this. On the one hand, we are using the parameters urged by the community 6 months ago. Had the MKR price gone up, we would have requested less MKR/FTE. However, the current budget situation across the DAO should not go unnoticed. @Patrick_J suggested (and I don\u2019t mind) the idea of putting ranked choice options for a different multiplier on our DAI compensation. Last time we held an informal poll so we could submit a figure supported by the community. I would like to know if there is a general preference between these items. If none persists, I am currently favoring Patrick\u2019s idea and would consider listing 1, 1.5, and 2 as potential multipliers for the on-chain poll.  Times are a bit tense at the moment, and I was personally dreading the coincidence of our 6 months being up for a new request. But we have full faith that the community can engage in difficult budget decisions like these with grace and respect. We plan to listen and respond to feedback here in this thread and would prefer comments about the proposal be directed here so there is a public source of what has been said to us about this proposal.

GovAlpha\u2019s role is fairly critical to the smooth functioning of the protocol, and our contributors are relied on for maintaining critical infrastructure on behalf of the DAO. We tend to be pretty cheap on the DAI compensation side (one of the reasons that the SES model didn\u2019t match our team composition), so making sure at least half of personal comp is tied up in vested MKR is our way for correcting that imbalance in a way that builds much stronger alignment to the DAO. While I understand dollar/DAI figure concerns on budgets, being financially tied to the performance of the MKR token is incredibly important to maintaining a long-term focus. In regards to how the 200% figure came to be, we initially proposed 150% IIRC but opened a poll on the multiplier. Delegates and community members alike asked why our MKR/FTE was one of the lower ones and our response was that we wanted to make a sustainable framework for us to use. I think proposing something under 200% (or changing the MKR moving price parameters) for the final version is pretty likely, just wanted to showcase what we were trying to point out last time by asking for a smaller multiplier. This system means when MKR price is trading high the 6 month vest will be low but you get the other side of that as well. But considering we don\u2019t have a reprice mechanism like many of the other Core Units that seems reasonable to me, provided it\u2019s at a level where the DAO can stomach the variance. ",

The ability of any individual CU employee to impact DAO performance is low.

MKR token vesting will primarily introduce large volatility to employee pay due to factors beyond the employees control.   Certainly wouldn\u2019t be arguing that we did anything to tank the price  but the actual price action isn\u2019t what\u2019s as important to the incentive alignment. By doing these continual streams we insure that everyone working for on GovAlpha has a vested interest in the protocol, at most 6 months away from the next year-long vesting date. It\u2019s not that the number can go up (tho that hopefully is a desire for the workforce as well) but rather that poor work or performance can result in losing that economic incentive. Moreover (last point I promise), MKR is more than just capital, it represents a very key part of the ecosystem on the governance and collateral management areas of the protocol. When I think about who I want to have MKR to keep the protocol safe, the people showing up day in and day out to maintain it are pretty high on that list. ",

If you have 50k worth of MKR that you are unable to access until January, you are incentivized to do your best to keep Maker\u2019s Governance processes as efficient as possible until that date. The way GovAlpha\u2019s structure works is that contributors have a continuously rolling amount of MKR vesting, meaning contributors should always be incentivized to keep everything working as efficiently as possible.     CodeKnight:  People can use the Dai they are paid in to buy MKR, or they can sell the MKR they are paid in to get Dai.   Don\u2019t underestimate status-quo bias.  As a general sidenote, one of the consequences of GovAlpha\u2019s MKR vesting structure is that it will come up for debate much more often than those of other core units. When we discussed this structure, we considered the ability to adjust frequently an advantage, and that it should be more respectful of MKR holders, and changing circumstances. In my mind this was an expression of trust in governance by GovAlpha, we setup a structure that gives us less protections over time than other core units because we felt it was a better model for the DAO than having 4-year locked in vesting structures. Based on Payton\u2019s comment, I think GovAlpha leadership is happy to make adjustments to the amounts given the current circumstances (that was after all the point of having it repeat more frequently.) But personally I would see having MKR cut off completely (if not part of a wider move across the entire DAO) as a betrayal of the trust we extended. It would also strongly indicate that core units should favour 4-year locked in structures in the future as opposed to more flexible ones. ",

It means that GovAlpha\u2019s vesting structure will take a disproportionate amount of time and energy from delegates and MKR holders.   This was a consideration. On balance, repeating a proposal once every 6 months with minor changes did not feel like a disproportionate amount of attention and energy. It\u2019s essentially \u2018continue status-quo yes/no\u2019 under normal circumstances this won\u2019t consume much effort or attention. I believe this is preferable to the arguably over-streamlined version of agreeing to a 4-year structure up front. Potentially there is room to compromise over timelines though, it doesn\u2019t need to be six-monthly.     CodeKnight:  High variance and frequency also puts delegates and MKR holders at a disadvantage vs CUs when it comes to budgets, as we have to monitor twenty different budget while CUs can focus all their energy on one.   This doesn\u2019t meaningfully change that. Governance still need to monitor the MKR vesting for 20 CU\u2019s if we have a longer term vesting plan. The advantage of this is that governance has a pre-arranged opportunity for intervention every 6 months as opposed to being locked into agreements made under different circumstances.     CodeKnight:  I don\u2019t want to cut it off completely. I want to standardize MKR vesting to streamline governance and compensation.   I want that too, I spent a lot of effort trying to make it happen at one point. The issue is that CU\u2019s internal structure and role is not standardized, so any attempt to standardize MKR compensation ends up negatively impacting some subset of core units. In many ways, GovAlpha\u2019s setup is an effort to move in that direction. The main advantage to standardization that this structure has is that it\u2019s entirely retroactive and calculated based on the DAI received over some historical period. This means that it could (in theory) generalize to any core unit and any change in circumstance in a way that a future-oriented structure cannot. CU\u2019s can pay in DAI in any manner that they wish (hourly, salaried, performance-based), and this version of the MKR component can support that. ",
