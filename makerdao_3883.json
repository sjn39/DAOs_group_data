Is there significant risk of losing ETH by staking? Would it be too hard to un-stake to return ETH to vault holders if necessary? Perhaps staking the ETH in existing vaults would be too complicated; maybe a new type (ETH-S?) could be created. Maybe it could have zero or even negative stability fees. If somehow possible, it seems like the staking rewards from the amount of ETH we hold would be quite substantial. Going wild with this calculator and the amount of ETH that daistats.com currently shows, the upper limit on potential annual revenue is in the hundreds of millions. MakerDAO could keep it, or pass some or all of it along to vault owners. If the latter, opening a Maker vault could become the easiest way to stake one\u2019s ETH; while also getting to spend it (as DAI), too. But, I know almost nothing about the technical aspects. So: what is stopping us from staking the ETH that we hold? Thank you! ",

But in the long-run, why not:   Keep the fees that the pools are making for ourselves, or save them for our users. Imagine a future in which we did implement vaults with staking and the new staked vault types grow to equal the non-staked vault types in size; perhaps some of the non-staked vaults are closed in favor of the staked ones. As I said in the original post, at current ETH levels, we\u2019d have hundreds of millions in additional annual revenues being generated if they were staked. Whether we keep some of it or pass all of it back to users, why dismiss the possibilities so quickly?   Access an untapped market of less technical users who won\u2019t go to Rocket or Lido and then come to Oasis; many of them don\u2019t even know that Ethereum staking exists.   Even users who do know that Ethereum staking exists would, I believe, prefer to deposit their ETH with a trusted entity like Maker than with some pool. And then, conveniently, have the ability to withdraw DAI if the need arises.   If most of our exposure to staked ETH is coming from our own custom vault type, we won\u2019t have to deal with liquidity and other risks of small tokens from Rocket, Lido, etc; it would just be ETH that we\u2019d be dealing with.   Most importantly: we gain a marketing advantage over our competitors with the lower effective rates, hopefully get a bunch more ETH collateral into vaults, and reduce dependency on USDC.   ",

I usually prefer to stay conservative around introducing big technical changes to the code or protocol, since the fact that Maker has been working for years and remained unhacked despite large incentives to do so is what gives people in my circles confidence in it. And I prefer Maker to be perceived as a stable foundation upon which other things can be built, much like Ethereum. However in this case I feel that it is warranted for MKR to take a rare, big, evolutionary step forward alongside its substrate ETH.     Patrick_J:  There is a non-zero risk of slashing, and that could theoretically lead to unbacked Dai if it is severe enough - if we are the ones staking the ETH then this is our loss to cover   Good point. Is it known yet how large this risk is? Perhaps we can model it and cover it by retaining a portion of the staking rewards.     Patrick_J:  At the moment - we need collateral to be liquid in the event of a market crash and liquidations. At present, you cannot withdraw staked ETH or earnings from the beacon chain so how would we cover our losses in the even of a market crash?   Yes, this whole thing will only become possible after \u201cthe docking\u201d, whenever withdrawals become possible. ",
