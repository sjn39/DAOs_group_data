Standardizing around a .disable() method on the provider would allow dapps to display a logout button if this disable method is available. This would be beneficial for providers that offer standard login experiences like Portis, Squarelink, Authereum, etc. and as a dapp developer you don\u2019t have to think about how to handle logging out for each provider. I believe web3connect does something similar with a .close() method on the provider. What are your thoughts on standardizing around an optional .disable() method on the provider for disconnecting and logging users out of the provider on the dapp? ",
