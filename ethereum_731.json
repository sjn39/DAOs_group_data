The Call for Rings Wiki has all other relevant links from the event.  Experiences Any anecdotes, experiences or \u201cah ha!\u201d moments you had In the Meta Magicians Ring, Elias proposed the word \u201csteward\u201d as the label for people who take responsibility for a ring. This simple label that captures care & facilitation without ownership felt right to me. We went further to start discussion about having 2 stewards per Ring, and expecting a level of responsibility. \u2014 @boris  add another experience Feedback The good, bad, and ugly.
