No, remember that the Protocol lives in the Ethereum blockchain, so anything that you do like sending Dai or interacting with a protocol like MakerDAO incurs in paying the fees of the Ethereum Blockchain (known as Gas Fees). The best thing you can do is look at websites like gasnow.org and be aware when this Gas Fees are low so you can interact with the protocol by a decent gas amount. ",

But I dont understand why the gas limit to start setting up the Vault is around 1000000 instead of the usual 21000-42000? That moves the fee to around 0.1-0.2 ETH which I think is huge. So I wonder if this is just a necesary first step or wheter there is another way of avoid this big amount. thanks again!!! ",
