                    "content": "There\u2019s been a lot of discussion about the inclusion of real world assets as collateral in Dai. While the core MKR governance community has long thought about and discussed the risks and benefits of real world assets as collateral, there is a wider community of Ethereum enthusiasts who love Dai and Maker, but have not followed governance closely and were shocked to learn that real world assets might be included in Dai. The result is that a lot of people have voiced their opinion and tried through various means to discourage MKR governance from including real world assets as collateral as the revelation spread through reddit and twitter. But from the depths of crypto twitter a potential solution also emerged: PurityDai As you might know, on the roadmap after Multi-Collateral Dai launch is the ability for Maker Governance to launch new Synthetic Assets, so that other Dai Stablecoins can also be created. This includes things like EuroDai, YuanDai, YenDai and even SP500Dai, GoldDai etc. But! Turns out the same concept can also be used to solve the real world asset controversy by allowing Maker Governance to press ahead with its plans to include real world assets in Dai, while also using the Synthetic Asset capability to create a version of Dai that does not have real world assets backing it, but is instead backed purely by ETH: PurityDai. What\u2019s really cool about this approach is that PurityDai would be a very unique asset in that it would have both the benefit of being backed only by ETH, and thus have no chance of having its collateral seized, but it would actually still also be protected against black swan events in the price of ETH, because it would share the same MKR with Dai and other synthetic assets, and thus would still benefit from the highly diversified black swan protection that real world assets offer. There would of course be a cost to this. Since PurityDai would have very restricted collateral in the long run - only ETH would be accepted - then there would be little room for supply growth. And because it has very unique security properties, then at the same time there might be a lot of demand for it. The result is high demand and low supply, which the Dai Credit System can only deal with in one way: Low, or even negative Dai Savings Rate. Where the rate ends up depends entirely on the market dynamic of this kind of unique asset. There\u2019s still some technical building blocks, and even greater risk and governance barriers that would need to be in place before something like this can be built, and it would for sure have to come after e.g. EuroDai and YuanDai as they are a lot simpler to create. But it is certainly possible to create this eventually if the demand is really there, and for now, the existence of this concept should be able to alleviate everyones concerns on both sides of the debate: Maker Governance gets to chug on with carefully adding real world collateral to Dai without vocal opposition, and sceptical ETH enthusiasts have a unique asset to look forward to around the time real world assets start to be included in the collateral portfolio. And PurityDai will not only give them what they like about SCD, it will also come with the additional level of black swan protection afforded by MCD and the real world assets, making it amongst the most robust cryptoassets imaginable. Everybody wins, and what started as a controversy ends up as a great story and concrete proof that innovation in Ethereum is truly driven by the community. ",

Since PurityDai would have very restricted collateral in the long run - only ETH would be accepted - then there would be little room for supply growth. And because it has very unique security properties, then at the same time there might be a lot of demand for it. The result is high demand and low supply, which the Dai Credit System can only deal with in one way: Low, or even negative Dai Savings Rate.   If Purity\u2019s DSR is negative, that just means that people won\u2019t put their Purity into the local savings contract, doesn\u2019t it? No rational actor would choose to deposit to lose money without any other gain. So I doubt a negative DSR will be really meaningful. But what then will be the price of this purity? Super-high SF? Built-in holder tax? Or something else?     rune:  Since PurityDai would have very restricted collateral in the long run - only ETH would be accepted - then there would be little room for supply growth.   I\u2019d add that there\u2019s a scenario where this is not a serious constraint. Right now it seems unlikely, but in case ETH\u2019s rate of appreciation keeps up or surpasses the demand for Purity, the expansion of the supply wouldn\u2019t be an issue. ",

Now with years of work nearing completion there is a small but vocal community that opposes the whole multicollateral idea. The opponents scale the whole range from not wanting any collateral except ETH, to not wanting any collateral that is not crypto or not wanting any collateral that is partly centralized or not wanting any collateral that is fiat based or not wanting any collateral based on real world securities. Others again have more philosophical arguments based on governance. Multicollateral DAI is however based on a vision. That is DAI for everybody, not just a select group of crypto enthusisasts. And the only way for DAI to scale, and I mean really scale, is to allow for as many types and categories of collateral as the system can manage to support. Governance, or rather the evolution of governance, will be absolutely crucial for this to become reality. Some people feels this is risky, but this is where risk management comes in. There will be setbacks and there will be trouble but we will deal with it within system parameters, learn from the event and move on. People that feel relying on a single crypto currency for collateral is safe just because it has worked for two and a half years have IMHO spent too little time both in crypto and in the real world. Time in crypto moves at the pace of dog-years where every month is at least a year or two for any other industry. Coinmarketcap is full of also-rans that are still around but without a single developer to push it forward. Death by go-to-zero is the only way that can end. Just go back a couple of years and see how the list of top-10 and top-20 coins have changed. Relying on Ethereum for safety is just fine if you want to dabble in DeFi but utterly superficial for any serious attempt at making a stablecoin capable of being a global force for financial stability. Within five years from now Maker could be on the Ethereum chain, on another blockchain, on some DLT-type tangle or even be its own chain. The possibilities are multiple and gluing DAI to a single collateral is in my eyes simply not worth any serious consideration. ",

For example DaiEUR etc. So if there is demand for PurityDai I don\u2019t see why not also add that.   Note that synthetics (eurodai, yendai, etc.) won\u2019t function based on a different collateral system. Dai (the dollar-pegged one) will be their collateral. They will be layer 2 currencies, if you will. ",

                    "content": "One important advantage of having two parallel stablecoin systems (like MCD and PurityDai) would be this: if one needs to be shut down, there will be an alternative, potentially stable, potentially well-embedded similar stablecoin people can flock to.     MicahZoltu:  This means that it shares at least some of the risks of the real world collateral.   Micah\u2019s observation is very relevant. I think sharing the same base (the MKR token) can cut both ways.  If MCD and PurityDai share the same recapitalization and governance token, the overall governance effort is easier and more focused. Also, one can rely on the other\u2019s strength for upholding the value of MKR. On the other hand, as Micah pointed out, one\u2019s catastrophic failure can cause the failure of the other system. If PurityDai is built completely separately with its own recapitalization and governance token (let\u2019s call it PUR), risks will be separated. But benefits will be too: it probably won\u2019t share the same governing expertise MKR already has, and building and maintaining this new system will incur its own additional overhead (e.g. new smart contract deployments).  Given that there will already be a significant extra attention required to run this system inside MKR, it might as well run separately. But I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s currently enough velocity to launch PurityDai as a system separate from MKR. (This might change in the future \u2013 e.g. when the first real-world asset is added to MCD.) ",
