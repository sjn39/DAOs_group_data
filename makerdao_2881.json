                    "content": "On the 26th October, the Smart Contracts Domain Team detected voting behaviour irregularities with respect to: Increase the Surplus Buffer, Oracle Whitelisting - October 23, 2020 proposal. It has since been confirmed that a flash loan was used to pass the October 23rd proposal in the following manner:  Oct 26, 2020, 17:37:17 UTC a single transaction was executed a. WETH was borrowed from dYdX with a $20m flash loan (50k ETH) b. This was deposited on AAVE, and used to borrow $7m MKR (13k MKR) c. The MKR was locked in governance, chief.lock() d. Voted on the proposal with chief.vote() e. Made the hat with called chief.lift() f. Then freed with chief.free() g. The spell with the hat was scheduled with spell.schedule() h. The MKR was unlocked and returned to AAVE and dYdX Finally, after the GSM delay of 12 hours (Oct 27, 2020, 05:37 UTC), the spell was then executed with spell.cast()   The Maker Foundation has been in contact with the BProtocol team, and are aware that they were responsible for the flash loan. BProtocol has been fully transparent in communicating their actions once the Foundation became aware of the voting irregularities. Their actions are a practical example for the community that flash loans can and may impact system governance and highlight that MKR market liquidity needs to be actively monitored. The DAO also needs to assess its ability to react in the event a more contentious vote is pushed through. The fact that the proposal in question was directly related to BProtocol being whitelisted on the ETHUSD Medianizer and OSM oracles raises some concerns as to how/if flash loans should be accepted in such circumstances.  In addition to this issue, last week was the first time in which a malicious governance attack using flash-loans has been theoretically possible (the available MKR liquidity exceeded the value of MKR on the hat.) While the GSM pause delay does allow governance 12 hours (currently) to react to a malicious proposal, it is still an open question as to whether MKR Holders would be able to react in time. Additionally, the Liquidation Circuit Breaker (FlipperMom) and the Oracle Freeze Module (OsmMom) are both modifiable outside of the GSM Pause Delay. In light of both the flash loan on the 23rd and the reduced amount of MKR on the hat, both the Smart Contracts Domain Team and the Governance Facilitator feel that the risk of malicious governance action has become unacceptably high. There are two primary issues that have been identified: 1. The risk of malicious governance action using flash loans has become unacceptably high. 2. Flash loans can be used to pass controversial governance proposals. The rest of this post will deal solely with the first issue, with the second to be addressed once the Maker Protocol has been further secured against malicious governance proposals. At time of writing, there is MKR liquidity available on multiple platforms that can be used by flash loan attacks:   42,649 MKR in Balancer  15,170 MKR in AAVE  5,626 MKR in Uniswap  This comes to a total of 63,445 MKR that is accessible using flash loans. Given that the current hat proposal has ~79k MKR, there is no immediate risk of governance attack. However, there is risk when new executive proposals are submitted. In light of this issue the Governance Facilitator and the MakerDAO Smart Contracts Domain team will take the following actions. Actions Prepare executive spell to minimize risk The MakerDAO Smart Contracts Domain Team will prepare an executive spell that if ratified will take the following actions:  The GSM pause delay will be increased to 72 hours. The Oracle Freeze Module (OsmMom) will be deauthorized. The Liquidations Circuit Breaker (FlipperMom) will be deauthorized.  We are aware that disabling the Oracle Freeze Module and the Liquidations Circuit Breaker increases risk in other areas. We feel that the Oracle and Liquidation risks are less than that of governance attack especially given the additional lightfeeds and box parameter. 72 hours was chosen given that it stretches across at least one working day, regardless of the timing on the governance attack. This gives Governance more time to secure the hat, and domain teams time to prepare an action to cancel the plotted spells. This executive spell will not immediately be put on-chain. Gather more MKR on the hat proposal We feel that additional MKR is required on the hat in order to ensure safety while MKR transitions from one proposal to another. The Governance Facilitator will provide additional updates and next steps once either of the following conditions has been met.  The MKR on the hat exceeds 100,000 MKR One week has passed.  100k MKR was chosen because it exceeds the 63k currently available liquidity, and the new governance portal has a feature that allows voting on multiple proposals at once which should mitigate the risk of the hat proposal decreasing below 63k during the transition. Signalling around Governance Attack Response The Governance Facilitator will post a signal request that will aim to confirm the following sentiment to all MKR Holders: \u201cIn the event of a malicious governance attack that leads to redeployment of the Maker Protocol prior to the introduction of flash loan guards into the governance process, the community and domain teams should do everything possible to burn the MKR involved in the attack, regardless of whether the owner was directly involved in the attack.\u201d Edit: [Signal Request] Should the Maker Community burn attacking borrowed MKR in the event of a governance attack leading to protocol redeployment? Reaching out to large MKR Holders The Smart Contracts Domain Team, and the Governance Facilitator will attempt to contact large MKR Holders with MKR on Aave, Balancer and Uniswap with the aim of convincing them to remove MKR from these platforms until flash loan guards are in place and to add their MKR to the current hat and vote in the coming executive. The executive containing YFI and BAL collateral onboarding will be delayed The Smart Contracts domain team was aiming to have these complete this week, however the flash loan issue has taken priority for the time being. The Smart Contracts Domain Team will explore options to mitigate the flash loan risk prior to the DssGov upgrade Given the potential severity of flash loan related attacks, the Smart Contracts Domain Team feels that it is wiser to resolve the vulnerability from flash loans sooner than would be possible if they waited for DssGov.

According to pools.vision, the largest MKR pool is earning roughly ~17% APR in BAL rewards. Balancer uses a mechanism called capFactor to limit the total dollar value of liquidity for any one token that is eligible for rewards (this was introduced to guard against manipulation of the distribution). We could potentially ask Balancer community to reduce MKR to a lower capFactor for the time being until we have guards in place against flash loans. This will reduce incentives to provide MKR liquidity. If this sounds like a good idea to pursue in the short term, I\u2019m happy to reach out to Balancer forum and team to see how this can be accomplished. ",

B.Protocol is built on top of Maker, and makes it stabler by bringing committed Keepers, who share proceeds with users. Showcasing the potential vote vulnerability was aimed to trigger an internal technical discussion on ways to improve it, and we did not anticipate the community will view it as an immediate threat. MakerDAO were very helpful to us during our integration process, and in retrospect we regret not disclosing this issue to them in a more responsible manner, which would have eliminated the sense of urgency.

This said, I would like to complain about the use of \u201cURGENT\u201d and \u201cEMERGENCY\u201d decisions. In this specific case, the issue was far from unpredictable. It was always there and pointed by many people. I myself (with all my limits) have mentioned it here:     Question about \"Buying votes\" - Danger? Governance       One \u2018solution\u2019 I can imagine (but I am sure it\u2019s a bit naive, and other possibilities exist) is to require the MKR to be locked for a certain amount of time (in the voting contract) before allowing them to express a vote.  This \u2018lock\u2019 could be activated only on certain critical situations, when we think that the risk of \u2018buying votes\u2019 is a concern.  Other ideas? In general the notion that borrowing MKR to attack the system using voting is well\u2013known. So this must have been discussed already.  Bu\u2026     more than 2 months ago. Why are we waiting the attack to happen (fortunately it was the BProtocol team) to start taking counter-measures? I understand that the attack has become theoretically viable only very recently, but it was clear months ago that this would happen at a certain point. Similarly, it is easy to predict that MKR-borrowing will become an issue eventually, even without recurring to flash loans. Flash loans just make it cheap and easy, today. We should now start discussing deeply about how to reorganise the tokenomics of MKR to incentivise virtuous behaviour (voting, participation, etc).     LongForWisdom:  Given that the current hat proposal has ~79k MKR,   It\u2019s not acceptable that only ~8% of existing MKR are used for voting, given that MKR is a Governance Token. ",

The risk of malicious governance action using flash loans has become unacceptably high. 2. Flash loans can be used to pass controversial governance proposals. The rest of this post will deal solely with the first issue, with the second to be addressed once the Maker Protocol has been further secured against malicious governance proposals.       yaronvel:  We meant no harm, and no harm was made.   @yaronvel just to be clear. The first issue mentioned takes priority due to its severity. I\u2019ll start getting to the second on Monday. I strongly disagree with your statement that no harm was done. A fundamental assumption within the Maker Protocol is that \u2018If you do not own MKR, you are not supposed to be able to influence governance decisions.\u2019 You do not own 13,000 MKR and you were not supposed to influence this governance decision. Just because the governance contract makes it possible to do something doesn\u2019t mean that you should do it. I believe that the claim that this was done to showcase a vulnerability is a rationalization of a decision that you made for entirely different reasons. The flash loan was not executed until the point at which it seemed like the vote was going to \u2018fail\u2019 (be replaced by the monthly MIPs vote). Showcasing a vulnerability was possible on any other governance vote, there has been 13k MKR available on Aave for months. Choosing to showcase it on your own proposal is a terrible idea, for this exact reason (it throws doubt on the outcome and leads to beliefs like this one.) I believe the most likely explanation for why you waited until the last minute is that you knew what you were doing was sketchy, but you felt that the Maker Governance process was less important than you getting access to the Maker Oracles and launching your platform. Ultimately it will be up to the community and actual MKR Holders to decide what (if any) response there should be, but that discussion will take place. Playing this off as no big deal is not helping your case (at least when it comes to me.) ",

The goal is to incentivize participation in a system. Ownership is one way though passive. Shy of allocating value to those that vote the alternative is to penalize those that don\u2019t. Neither of those is good options in my mind. From my lens, a combination of vote delegation (possibly compensated delegation) and L2 /  roll ups should help minimize all friction. as for the rest that don\u2019t vote, the parallel is corporate board voting. Last time i checked if an owner controls 5% of the equity (in a large publicly traded company, eg Coca Cola) he / she has basically a majority on any vote given the average turnout on voting. ",

First things first, I am aware that my actions were not the textbook definition of a responsible disclosure, and I do regret that as a result an urgent response was needed. Beside the ethical considerations, i also failed to see that the MKR in balancer is also part of the threat (and without it, the threat was very minor). Some factual details:   The smart contract that voted with the flash loan was deployed to mainnet more than 24 hours before it was executed. Prior to this proposal I never dived into the MakerDAO governance process.   Nothing was done in a rush, and I deliberately did not try to hide my tracks, despite having sufficient time to use tornado-cash or other means prior to the execution.   The timing of the actual flash loan was dictated by the earliest possible time that would make the vote count.   On a more personal note, B.Protocol brings new Keepers to MakerDAO, and tries to help make it more stable. Looking forward to elaborate on the above next week. ",

I live in country (France) where the government borrows corporate shares to vote on shareholders meetings and force a vote (interestingly it was to award long term shareholders, mainly himself, with double weighted votes). Obviously, we should find a fix for that and I am glad that we are already quite advanced. ",

See previous post if this is news to you: [Urgent] Flash Loans and securing the Maker Protocol As promised, I\u2019m providing an update now the current hat exceeded 100k MKR. The next steps are now as follows: Post Executive Spell on Friday at 16:00 UTC (usual time) As mentioned previously, the contents of this spell are as follows:  A GSM pause delay increase from 12 hours to 72 hours. The Oracle Freeze Module (OsmMom) will be deauthorized. The Liquidations Freeze Module / Circuit Breaker (FlipperMom) will be deauthorized.  We are aware that disabling the Oracle Freeze Module and the Liquidations Freeze Module increases risk in other areas. We feel that the Oracle and Liquidation risks are less than that of governance attack especially given the additional lightfeeds and box parameter. 72 hours was chosen given that it stretches across at least one working day, regardless of the timing on the governance attack. This gives Governance more time to secure the hat, and domain teams time to prepare an action to cancel the plotted spells.  Give that the amount of MKR on that hat has meaningfully increased, the Smart Contracts Domain Team and the Governance Facilitator are comfortable deploying an additional executive vote. Friday was chosen as it matches the usual schedule and should mean that more MKR Holders are prepared to move their MKR in a short time after the spell is deployed. Please note that the new governance portal contains functionality to vote for both the current hat and a new proposal (screenshot below.) Making use of this functionality will help to ensure security while both executives are active. Thank you to everyone that has helped to secure the hat. image1662\u00d7871 155 KB ",

Assuming comprehension of this concept, let\u2019s expand upon the rules for when the checkbox does or does not appear: The checkbox \u201cKeep my MKR on old proposal to secure the Maker protocol\u201d is checked by default and appears if:  The old proposal a user is voting on is the hat, and The new proposal a user wants to vote on is below the current hat in MKR weight  The checkbox changes to a \u201cconcentrate all my MKR on this proposal\u201d button if:  The proposal a user is looking at has not yet passed, and The user is currently voting on a slate with multiple proposals  The checkbox changes to \u201cAdd MKR to secure the protocol\u201d button, if:  The user is looking at the current hat and has not voted on it yet  This small enhancement should make it easier to retain your support on the existing hat while adding support to a new proposal.
