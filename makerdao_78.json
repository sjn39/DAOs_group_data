Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on applying collateral token. After launching in February, over $100m worth of RAI has been minted with more than $300M worth of ETH deposited in the protocol. RAI has managed to stabilize using its on-chain PID controller and is now undergoing a governance minimization process with the intention to calcify the protocol. RAI Redemption Price:  image795\u00d7447 35.7 KB  3. Provide a brief history of the project. RAI was created as an alternative to USD-pegged stablecoins and as an experiment in peg-less stability. The project began as a ethresear.ch post by Ameen Soleimani, and was then picked up and built into the system we see today by the newly formed Reflexer Labs Team. 4.

                    "content": "I may have had a hand in encouraging this MIP6. At a technical level, Rai is based on a forked version of the MCD codebase. As a \u201ccrypto purist\u201d I\u2019ve enjoyed seeing the project take the reflexive approach to peg management envisioned in the original Maker design. This means that while the price of the output token is not stable, it potentially would work as a partially countervailing force to ETH price swings in the MCD system, while providing a stable asset that is not as exposed to regulatory risk as centralized stablecoins. Despite being based on the MCD codebase, Reflexer appeals to a different customer, namely those less sensitive to a hard peg, than Maker\u2019s vaults, but the output is itself a crypto-native asset that can be collateralized into Dai. As far as risks go, I\u2019ll get territorial and say that the risk of reliance on Chainlink oracles within their own liquidation system should be examined. We\u2019d also need to be concerned about getting enough liquidity to make the adoption worthwhile. Reflexer is offering liquidity rewards to it\u2019s own users for providing various liquidity options throughout DeFi protocols, it might be worth requesting that Maker vaults be added to their liquidity mining program to boost Dai generation. In sum, I think that this can help offload a small part of our USDC in a sustainable way. ",

RAI\u2019s goal has always been to serve as an alternative collateral to centralized stablecoins, and over the last year MakerDAO has judiciously welcomed USDC collateral in order to maintain DAI\u2019s $1 peg. Of course, we know that RAI won\u2019t replace USDC overnight, but we believe that introducing RAI collateral within MakerDAO is a small step in the right direction\u2014towards a diversity of stablecoin collateral that reduces the risks of depending primarily on any single stablecoin. It would be our great honor for RAI to serve the MakerDAO community.  \ud835\ude1c\ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude0b \ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude30\ud835\ude27 \ud835\ude0e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude24. 2021 To learn more about RAI, please read my RAI launch post (where I do my best to give as much credit to MakerDAO as possible), as well as my recent tweet thread explainer on what we\u2019ve learned about RAI in the ~6 months it has been live.

I even took out the loans for my house using crypto in Maker vaults. I fell in love with DAI when DAI was simple to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s cypherpunk money - backed by ETH\u201d. DAI helped my company bank when no one else would. At some point in mid-2018 we held 1.5% of all the DAI. Today the story of DAI is a bit more complicated, which is why I worked on RAI, to preserve that initial vision of simplicity, with a few tweaks to enhance stability without needing centralized collateral.  If DAI is how DeFI went wrong, why are you even here?  MakerDAO made the pragmatic choice at the beginning of DeFi summer\u2014in the face of massive DAI demand\u2014to introduce USDC and the PSM and defend the peg. It was probably the best decision for MakerDAO at the time, and the long-term consequences of USDC dominance were not super clear. Now however, with USDC passing USDT (and on track to keep growing), USDC dominance is increasingly concerning to me, as it could mean abdication of Ethereum\u2019s fork-choice to USDC (Bloomberg wrote about this today). I\u2019m here today because I want to try\u2014however futile it might seem\u2014to help reduce the dependence of MakerDAO and Ethereum generally on centralized collateral like USDC, by providing RAI as an alternative.

But I\u2019d be curious to get some of the RAI folks (@ameensol @stefan) interpretations here. What is the incentive to use RAI as collateral to mint DAI in both the short-term and the long-term? My understanding is that if RAI supply is not keeping up with RAI demand (measured via market price), then the price of RAI is reduced via the redemption price controller until this is brought back into balance. So if there is too much RAI demand, people are probably not going to lever up on  RAI? In the opposite case, if RAI supply is higher than RAI demand, I can see why people would want to use a RAI vault (to profit on the redemption price increase.) My concern is that (like with DAI) there is far more demand for a stable (or volatility minimized) asset than there is for credit on ETH in most or all market environments, and that means that in most market environments I would expect RAI redemption price to be stable or decreasing - and therefore RAI would not be a collateral people want to mint DAI against.

We had people freaking out this summer when the rate was going negative but in the end, the rate has been positive over the last 3 months so longs were fine. On the topic of RAI trending down over time, it\u2019s a possibility. Assuming that happens, there are still cases where the rate fluctuations cancel out over many months. One thing that could alleviate this concern and hasn\u2019t been proposed yet is a LP token containing RAI (and DAI?) as collateral.

Quiet:  It could be a major help in reducing usdc reliance with safe (both value stability and governance/existential threat wise) and synergistic eth native alternatives.   I really want this to be true, but\u2026  The market cap of RAI is ~75M. We have ~3B of centralized stables to shift. We need two orders of magnitude more RAI available to completely offset the USDC. One can certainly argue that 75M is better than nothing, but there are other initiatives that can likely deliver more decentral-backed DAI than RAI can at this time. Using RAI in a PSM is dangerous for Maker. If we onboard a huge amount of RAI, unless the CDP\u2019s are there in Reflexer, the RAI will lose its value and cost the protocol money over the long term. Using RAI outside of a PSM doesn\u2019t provide much of an incentive for minting DAI using RAI. The only situation where we end up with large amounts of RAI-backed DAI minted is if people expect RAI value to increase over the long term.  Maybe I\u2019m missing something obvious, but yeah. I don\u2019t see how onboarding RAI makes a dent in the centralized stables backing DAI with exposing Maker to significant losses due to the shift in the RAI peg given its current market cap. ",

I would comment a little on a point you made regarding RAI\u2019s stability so far though:     Quiet:  but Rai is a unique potential stable collateral type by virtue of having a track record of being stable over a reasonable period   It has a track record of being stable at a marketcap of 75M or so. Because of the way the mechanism works, large imbalances in supply or demand will adjust the price of RAI. It may be that we haven\u2019t seen this yet because there hasn\u2019t been enough of a supply or demand imbalance to trigger this mechanism in a significant way. Currently there is a 3B supply-demand imbalance on DAI which manifests as the PSM marketcap. How will RAI react to 3B supply-demand imbalance, or even a 10th of that amount? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure anyone will until it happens and we find out. But finding that out when you hold a significant amount of RAI, or a significant amount of Reflexer CDP volume would be pretty stressful, I imagine. ",

Anchor protocol is an open and permissionless savings protocol that offers a low volatile yield of ~20% APY on UST (Terra Stable coin pegged to USD). Simply, users deposit UST into Anchor on the Terra Blockchain and receive aUST \u2013 a token that is redeemable for the initial deposit + accrued interest. Therefore, interest collection is done just by holding onto aUST. Why aUST as collateral? Well, currently users can bridge aUST through terra bridge and receive an ERC-20 version of the token on Ethereum. aUST can then be used as collateral on maker to generate DAI, be sold for UST to leverage their interest earning position in anchor. e.g., UST \u2192 Anchor \u2192 aUST \u2192 Bridge \u2192 Deposit into Maker get Dai \u2192 Sell for UST \u2192 Bridge \u2192 Anchor \u2192 repeat.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Since 2020, Anchor Protocol has provided a fully decentralized fixed income instrument through diversified staking yields, money markets and the ANC token incentives and governance. Since its launch it has accrued 5.7 billion UST in TVL, of which ~3.7 billion is collateral such as LUNA and ETH and ~2 billion is UST deposits. Additionally, Anchor\u2019s development team has made it exceptionally easy for other projects to leverage the deposit functionality of Anchor through JavaScript SDKs.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

Anchor Gov: https://forum.anchorprotocol.com/ Anchor Discord: Anchor Protocol  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  Currently, the main use case of aUST is on Mirror Finance as collateral to borrow or short mAssets (assets that mirror the price of real-world assets such as stocks etc.). aUST is still widely underutilized and with their recent expansion to aUST on Ethereum I expect protocols to start allowing it as collateral (e.g., abracadabra will be soon)  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  Currently, there is no explicit claim for full legal responsibility of the collateral (my findings), however they make a very big effort towards the security of the protocol with multiple audits, bug bounty programs, and additionally, users are able to purchase smart contract and UST peg insurance through a range of insurance protocols (i.e., Nexus Mutual, InsurAce, Bridge Mutual and Unslashed). Furthermore, the company resides in South Korea and lists Do Kwon and Daniel Shin as their only two employees (Anchor Protocol - Employees, Board Members, Advisors & Alumni)  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  Exchange for the aUST occurs on Anchor protocol itself. However, UST is widely available on multiple blockchains. ",

Adding UST as collateral defeats the purpose of this proposal. aUST is an interest-bearing asset (~20% APY), therefore, if used as collateral it will allow users to leverage this yield as I discussed in my proposal. Furthermore, Anchor actually has a smart contract set up on ETH which allows you to send UST and receive aUST without having to leave the ETH network. ",

                    "content": "aUST pays very high yield (currently around 19.5% APY), but on the other hand UST and Anchor lending protocol face substantial risks which may outweigh the stability fees we could earn from onboarding it. UST risks: The peg is maintained via an algorithmic mint/burn mechanism against the native LUNA token. This sounds fancy, but in essence LUNA is using demand debt (able to be called in for repayment by the lender at any time) to finance token buybacks. This is a very unstable financial position, as this process can go into reverse when UST demand falls (eg. if people are worried about Terra solvency). In a worst case scenario, a deluge of user withdrawals could cause a self-reinforcing bank run that tanks both LUNA and UST price to 0. If a bank run did occur, there\u2019s little to no chance of Maker being able to liquidate collateral before the value had collapsed. Anchor risks: Most debt on Anchor is collateralized with bLUNA (liquid staked LUNA token). bLUNA can experience large price discounts during market crashes because there is limited market liquidity and redeeming for LUNA takes 21 days. So Anchor faces significant and concentrated risk from this collateral type. Anchor subsidizes borrowers with ANC token emissions, and also subsidizes aUST holders (UST lenders) with top up payments from a \u201cyield reserve\u201d. Falling ANC token price or lower borrowing utilization could cause depletion of these reserves, which would force Anchor to lower aUST yield. This probably wouldn\u2019t lead to principal losses, but would constrain the amount of risk compensation Maker could earn from aUST collateral. For these reasons, I personally think aUST may be too risky to be onboarded as Maker collateral. ",

If you guys have any questions about aUST, UST and Anchor Protocol, I\u2019m open to clarify any concerns. If anyone is interested in knowing how aUST generates ~20% APY from its cash flow sources, I wrote a detailed Twitter thread about this which you can read here: https://twitter.com/GabrielGFoo/status/1469331215295533059?t=w0yEcWdRiUHOAS5Zb3x--Q&s=19 Also the reason why there is a token called aUST is that it is a tokenized IOU consisting of UST and its accruing interest. For gas efficiency, interest does not need to be claimed through an on-chain transaction, instead aUST is a token which appreciates against UST by 20% APY, owning aUST gives holders the right to claim the underlying UST + interest accrued. Do let me know if you guys have any concerns. ",

Annabel Marketing and Business Development at TrueUSD 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? TrueCoin, LLC, the entity behind TrueUSD (\u201cTUSD\u201d), and by Techeryx. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. TrueUSD (TUSD) is the first independently-verified digital asset redeemable 1-for-1 for US Dollars. It is the first regulated stablecoin fully backed by the US Dollar. Techteryx, an Asia-based conglomerate with businesses in Hong Kong, Singapore, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing, etc. in the traditional real estate, entertainment, environmental, and information technology industries, is committed to meeting the need for financial innovation globally amongst traditional sectors. All TUSD funds are held by fully licensed and regulated banks and trust companies in the United States and Hong Kong, including PrimeTrust (https://www.primetrust.com/), Silvergate Bank (https://www.silvergatebank.com/) and First Digital (https://1stdigital.com/), Signature Bank (https://www.signatureny.com). TUSD is minted by users initiating a US dollar wire transfer to the banks that TrueUSD has established partnerships with (mentioned above). The US dollars are held in escrow at the corresponding financial institution. For every TUSD minted there is a corresponding US dollar in a bank account subject to ongoing accounting audits by a reputable third-party CPA, Armanino LLP (\u201cArmanino\u201d). TUSD is a fiat-backed stablecoin and honors transparency with 24/7 on-chain attestations by Armanino, making it a great option to diversify the stablecoin selections here on Maker. Diversification is important in investment strategy, and we are confident it would be beneficial for both TrueUSD and the Maker community to support TUSD as collateral on PSM. Through this collaboration, we can jointly welcome new users to experience DeFi on MakerDao, renowned as one of the first DeFi projects established in the industry. 3. Provide a brief history of the project. MAY 2018 - TUSD lists on Binance SEP 2018 - Market cap exceeds $100 million AUG 2019 - TUSD launches on Binance Chain SEP 2020 - Market cap exceeds $500 million MAR 2021 - TUSD launches natively on Avalanche Chain APR 2021 - TUSD launches natively on TRON Chain MAY 2021- TUSD launches natively on Binance Smart Chain JUN 2021- TUSD breaks all-time market cap record at over $1.7 billion OCT 2021- TUSD reaches $300 million in circulating supply on TRON OCT 2021- TUSD launches the TrueUSD Fountain Incentive Plan 4.

How is the applying collateral type currently used? TrueUSD is a USD-backed stablecoin. It is used by traders exchanging it for other assets on cryptocurrency exchanges. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? More than one organization carries responsibility for the collateral. These entities reside in the US and Hong Kong. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? TUSD has trading pairs such as Binance, Huobi, Bittrex, Digifiinex, OKEx, Poloniex, HitBTC, KuCoin, MEXC, for Centralized Exchanges and SushiSwap, Uniswap, Ellipsis, Pangolin, and PancakeSwap, for Decentralized Exchanges. Additionally, TUSD can be exchanged at a fixed 1:1 rate on the TUSD exchange. 10. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. n/a ",

If you want to read up what happened last year, here are some good threads:     TUSD is undergoing a material change to its ownership structure. Is there a process for reducing exposure in the event of a material change? Risk       The team behind TUSD announced that ownership of the token will be transferred to another entity:   Today, we\u2019re proud to announce TUSD will enter the next stage of its growth. Ownership of TUSD will be moving over to an Asia-based consortium that will be working with TRON to develop TUSD on Ethereum, TRON, and other blockchain networks.   The TUSD contracts are upgradeable, and this new (and seemingly unknown) entity will be able to update the token at will. Because of this, I would imagine tha\u2026         [Signal Request] Manage TUSD exposure due to ownership change Signal Archive       We had a long discussion those last 2 weeks regarding the change of ownership of TUSD (not to be confused with USDT). You can read all the arguments here.  The current DC is $135M. $53M DAI are borrowed. This is locking 20% of the total amount of TUSD in circulation. It doesn\u2019t generate any revenue for us but helps a bit to keep the peg (but any stablecoin will do).  Now is the time for action.   How do you want to handle TUSD? Please vote below.  If the set DC to 0 wins, no new DAI will be mint\u2026     I have no idea if something happened in the meantime. ",

We are more than happy to answer in a clear and transparent way and add to the information you have provided. First and foremost, we would like to address the articles published in December 2020, and confirm that the data originally provided to the community upon TrueUSD\u2019s transition from TrustToken to Techteryx is still accurate:  TrueUSD is still working hand in hand with the Trusttoken team for compliance and operations, and that banking partners are still the ones Trusttoken works with, namely PrimeTrust (https://www.primetrust.com/ ), Silvergate Bank (https://www.silvergatebank.com/), First Digital (https://1stdigital.com/ ), and Signature Bank (www.signatureny.com). The smart contracts remain the same to this day. TrueUSD is still being audited by Armanino, who, in addition to live attestations of stablecoins, also provide \u201cproof of reserves\u201d audits for exchanges (Proof of Reserves | Armanino).  Since those articles were posted, TrueUSD has launched on additional chains (Avalanche, TRON, Binance Smart Chain, Fantom, Polygon, and Cronos), on top of Binance and Ethereum. TUSD user addresses have also exceeded over 400,300 and our market cap reached an all-time high record of over $1.7 billion. We also started working with over 40 DeFi projects that include lending protocols such as AAVE, Venus, and Scream, and all of which TUSD has decently high utilization rates as a collateral asset. We also launched a stablepool on Balancer Protocol, providing rewards and liquidity on Polygon for our users to enjoy. We strive to provide our users with countless opportunities for them to use their TUSD across multiple chains while maintaining our commitment to transparency and security in services and product. And to help develop more DeFi ecosystems, we have launched our Fountain Incentive Plan worth $1 billion. Once again and as it was originally mentioned last year, we would like to assure the Maker community of our commitment to TrueUSD\u2019s transparency and security in our services and product. We appreciate any questions presented and will address them in a timely and explanatory manner. ",

I am trying to answer a question of even if we do all the work making a vault here how much DAI will this mint.   Like RARE has to participate in governance, and is used to do what else.   How much of this market can we have any hope of expecting to make it into a vault. Example:  BAT has like MC of 1.155B  and we have only 10.4M locked BAT (1%) minting 1.4M DAI paying 4%.  This vault earns Maker a whopping 56K DAI a year.   Does this even pay for all the costs involved in adding it.? If RARE even gets to 1% of MC locked minting DAI will the revenues generated be worth the effort? We have RWA looking to get on-line here ready to mint 10\u2019s of Millions of DAI.   Should we even be bothering to consider MIP6 applications that can\u2019t justify 10M DAI minted or more? BTW:  At current 6B the idea we get to 10B via MIP6 applications even doing 10M is so out of whack as almost to be funny.   Maker has limited resources,  the DAO really needs to focus these limited resources to actually get to the bigger fruit not at picking up scraps.   I like RARE and a lot of other DAO communities btw but if they are coming to the table here I want to see 100M or above as realistic DAI minting to devote time to bringing forward. I don\u2019t want this to be a slight on any other community but really just a statement of a practical view of Maker and really MakerDAO practicalities at this point. ",

RARE tokens are similar to MKR in that holders set certain parameters on the RARE platform, which is the NFT/digital art equivalent to the Guggenheim, Centre Pompidou or the MOT in Tokyo. I\u2019m not sure what is being planned or discussed for the token\u2019s future functionality, but it can and should begin to earn fees drawn from primary and secondary art sales on the platform. For holders, it starts to look like an equity share in Sotheby\u2019s or Christie\u2019s, so pretty cool. From our standpoint, we have a decentralized crypto asset that offers exposure to a growing marketplace in a hot space (NFTs). Many long-term RARE supporters, like 1Confirmation, are MKR holders, so there is a philosophical alignment among the projects. And the more decentralized valuable assets on the platform, the better diversified we are as far as our primary product offering (vaults). RARE might not be grand slam collateral, but onboarding it is another step in the right direction. Lastly, with Growth\u2019s outreach, I believe we can convince the Superrare team to (i) use vaults for RARE treasury management and (ii) list Dai as a purchasing currency on the platform. Both developments would positively impact Maker and Dai expansion and promote Dai over centralized fiat token alternatives. NB - - I am a digital art collector and RARE holder and plan to open a RARE vault if the opportunity arises. ",

Curve finance is a decentralized exchange platform focusing on swaps between like assets (stablecoins, wrapped assets, etc). The Curve AMM formula provides amplified liquidity around 1:1 ratio, which allows for larger trades with low slippage and better capital efficiency.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Curve launched in the beginning of 2020 with USD stablecoin pools. Since then, Curve has moved forward and provided liquidity for other tokens. In January 2021, Curve began supporting the stETH pool\u2013which is a liquidity pool that contains stETH and ETH, that allows Users to interact with these pools to purchase stETH, or ETH with low slippage. Any transactions that take place within this pool are paid out to liquidity providers via trading fees in CRV. Why is the Curve stETH-ETH liquidity pool important? Without a liquidity pool for stETH, users cannot swap their stETH for ETH. This swapping between stETH and ETH effectively unstakes their ETH from the Lido contract. Without any liquidity pools, users will not be able to unstake their staked ETH until Ethereum launches Phase 2. To incentivize liquidity for stETH, liquidity providers are rewarded for providing their tokens into the Curve liquidity pool. In this way, liquidity providers will be incentivized to keep Lido liquid, where users can decide to un-stake their ETH at any time for whatever amount.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

CurveLP-stETH-ETH is a source of liquidity for trading between stETH and ETH. Users can deposit one or both assets to the pool in exchange for LP tokens, and earn a portion of the fees charged on trades. LP tokens can also be staked in Curve\u2019s gauge contracts to earn inflationary CRV token rewards.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  Curve LP tokens are permissionless assets, no party bears legal responsibility for the asset.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  CurveLP-stETH-ETH can be exchanged for underlying assets (in ETH and stETH) directly via the Curve finance, Uniswap v2, and 1inch Liquidity Protocol contracts. ETH (Ethereum) is traded on a wide variety of centralized and decentralized exchanges. Balancer has also released MetaStable Pool launch, for stETH-ETH liquid staking.
