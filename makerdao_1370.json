                    "content": "Following on from the Growth CU monthly update , and with a view to provide more regional granularity for the community , include an overview of some of the recent activity from the European region HIGHLIGHTS  Partnering with Centrifuge to bring Mastercard to Defi  In a multi-party collaboration effort and after almost 9 months of discussions and design , we were able to successfully conduct a pilot with Mastercard and their provenance blockchain partner FSCo to tap DeFi and a Maker vault via the ConsolFreight pool as an alternative source of funding for Supply Chain Finance ( see here for more details ) A special thanks to the team at Centrifuge ( @Martin @ctcunning ) who supported the entire process as genuine partners and we look forward to exploring many more exciting use cases together with them. The appetite to further explore DeFi as a funding source for Supply Chain Finance ( a multi $trillion market ) has definitely been lit with the Mastercard Digital Assets team and next steps will include reviewing models which will allow us to scale to bigger experiments.  First steps with L2 ZK rollups ( zkSync & StarkNet )  Together with the Starkware ecosystem team and the StarkNet Engineering CU, we were pleased to announce the launch of the Starknet DAI bridge ( see here for more details ) One of the partners we are working closely with to grow DAI presence on these L2\u2019s is Argent, with a mobile wallet offering for zkSync and a fast growing browser extension , ArgentX , for StarkNet. Thanks to this collaboration we are already seeing L2 DAI listed with their onramp partners , and future collaboration will include a DAI education campaign for their growing user base as well as a product marketing campaign to onramp more DAI onto their platform. MARKET & STRATEGY OVERVIEW  Regulatory & Competitive Landscape  The three most relevant regulatory regions in Europe for the crypto markets are the UK, EU & Switzerland. The UK with the recently announced Financial Services and Markets bill seems to have taken a pro-crypto stance with stablecoins to be brought within regulation paving their way for use in the UK as a recognised form of payment ( see here for more details ) The just announced European Union MiCA framework on the other hand appears more like a \u201ccrackdown\u201d with liquidity reserves requirements for stablecoin issuers and a cap on daily transaction volume ( see here for more details ) Switzerland is its own pro crypto ( under FINMA regulation ) ecosystem and one where we plan to spend some more time exploring growth opportunities moving forward. The newly announced launches from Circle for its Euro backed stablecoin ( EUROC ) and Tether for its GBP backed stablecoin ( GBPT ) will no doubt provide some learning for market dynamics and acceptance for these native European stablecoins. For the crypto environment overall though, it does feel like a wave of regulation is incoming.  Strategic Focus  Over the next quarter we look forward to delivering over the line the following partner integrations which have been large consumers of DAO resources and bandwidth over the last few quarters ; SG-Forge with a new RWA vault to refinance a AAA-graded covered mortgage bond RocketPool with a new supported liquid staking collateral type of rEth Monetalis with their liquid bond allocation strategy and driving an important and new revenue growth stream for the DAO. Each of these strategic partner integrations will provide a great PR/Brand opportunity and allow for new initiatives to be explored both with the partners themselves and also the wider ecosystem. Together with the L2 focus this coming quarter, we will further explore the institutional DeFi opportunity. European markets are leading the way with tokenizing TradFi markets ( SG-Forge being a great example ) and opening the possibility to onboard $trillion\u2019s of new collateral into DeFi structures - A vision that is shared by large Financial Firms Digital Asset groups who welcome the increased regulatory oversight in the sector and see an opportunity to invest during this bear cycle. One agile and innovative partner exploring this institutional DeFi segment is Swarm Markets and we look forward to participating in their upcoming panel and event as part of London Fintech week targeting the institutional opportunity as well as collaborating on future integrated solutions. GENERAL UPDATES 6 closed integrations in the quarter including, Mastercard RWA pilot via Centrifuge Paraswap PSM integration Swarm Markets - institutional grade DAI liquid staking pool  StellaSwap - DAI basepool on Moonbeam network 25 opportunities in commitment or execution phase.

HIGHLIGHTS  DAI is the first stablecoin to be whitelisted in Japan, meaning DAI is the only stablecoin which is allowed by JFSA to be listed on the Japanese exchanges. DAI is currently listed on GMO coin and Coinbest. JVCEA also released a \u201cgreen list\u201d tokens early this year - the conditions for being added to the green list include being listed on three exchanges in Japan.  While MKR token is already green-listed, DAI is not, and therefore the next step is to work with the next largest exchange in Japan to list DAI and get DAI green-listed as well.  DAI is supported on vivid.money, a challenger bank which has about 500k users. Both DAI and MKR listing will be bringing DAI new use cases. Users can earn 1.5% cashback if they were to spend DAI on the app. And we will be running some co-marketing campaigns to drive user growth on our partner\u2019s app by offering additional 1.5% cashback (fully subsidised by vivid money) to draw crypto native users to their app which is a win-win for both parties. Here is a snapshot of DAI on vivid money.  MARKET & STRATEGY OVERVIEW  Regulatory & Competitive Landscape  Regulators in Asia are tightening their grips on cryptos after Terra\u2019s UST collapse and all the contagion effects. Both the largest retail banks in Australia and Singapore (CBA and DBS) abandoned their retail crypto plans. But on a brighter note, the central banks are keen to explore wholesale use cases. MAS, the Central bank of Singapore is currently piloting an industry project to explore tokenisation of financial assets. The programme is known as Project Guardian, set to explore potential DeFi applications in wholesale funding markets. And this is a great opportunity for us to engage in a conversation with the regulator to see if we can play a role in the pilot experiment.  Strategic Focus  i) IV Over the next quarter, we will be focusing on working with different profile of borrowers on setting up institutional vault (IV), ie, family offices in Singapore and Hong Kong and the likes of Antpool (bitcoin miner). According to the Global Family Office Report 2021 showed that 19% of family offices in Asia-Pacific invested in cryptocurrency. Asia-Pacific families had the equity and appetite for risk in crypto, fuelled by next-generation enthusiasm. Three in four families\u2019 wealth rose over the pandemic and seven in 10 family offices saw an increase in assets under management. Targeting the family office opens up a new market opportunity for IV which in turn helps drive DAI supply. AntAlpha\u2019s Signal request to further investigate the possibility of implementing the first IV passed at the end of May. We are working with Antalpha team now to explore a smaller retail vault to start because of the market volatility. There are also some feedbacks I gathered from potential IV leads after the market crash in May, that is borrowers are now looking for:  Low-risk and stable yield; Better yield on DAI, ie. they would hold DAI if it gives them a relatively credit-risk-free yield; Fixed stability fees might help them to have better predictability of interest rates and cash flows.  ii) CeFi Binance Pay is rolling out Binance crypto debit card in Argentina. Given DAI is widely adopted in LATAM, it is natural to have DAI to be supported on the card. More details here, with updates to follow: Dai Sees Trading Volume in Latin America Quadruple During Pandemic | Binance News As for crypto.com, DAI remains to be a low volume token on the exchange, we are working with different counter-parties including both crypto.com and Cronos team to increase DAI volume and liquidity. iii) L1/L2 Polygon launched their zkEVM chain recently and we are having discussions with the team to bridge canonical DAI to zkEVM first because the process of getting canonical DAI to the zkRollup is quite similar to Starknet and then to deploy Maker Protocol on the network (either Polygon/zkEVM) at a later stage. GENERAL UPDATES General integrations from last quarter: Instadapp - DAI lite-vault Meshswap XT com Bybit - supported DAI withdrawal to zksync Rain - middle east crypto exchange ",

Given DAI is widely adopted in LATAM, it is natural to have DAI to be supported on the card.   I love this idea very much, but I make a small point, DAI is not being used massively in Latin America but in Argentina, as I have said before, the market in Latin America is free, it does not have strict regulators, the living example is USDT circulating calmly throughout the retail market, if we apply a marketing idea in Argentina (which is the country most exposed to DAI in Latin America) we will be able to open the regions to other neighboring countries, and even geopolitically speaking, looking at Colombia is not unreasonable either, but particularly in Venezuela the market is totally dominated by USDT despite being the most insecure stablecoin, if a total marketing idea is proposed in Latin America to educate the population and let them know how safe DAI is I would have no hesitation whatsoever that we would remove that stable king position held by USDT ",
