Specification  Motivation The functions of IS-001 do not require a Core Unit, and should be reduced to contracted services by Core Units that wish to retain Immunefi (the company). This is expected to result in more than 12,000 DAI a month in personnel cost savings alone. Therefore, this Core Unit should be granted severance and be offboarded. This is part of the list of reforms I laid out here for @rune and plan to pursue.  Core Unit ID IS-001  Budget Implementation On this proposal\u2019s approval: No more Dai will be transferred for the use of this Core Unit, either through streaming or through direct payments.  Golden Parachute Immunefi CU or the community should suggest an appropriate severance for the two contributors. ",

                    "content": " Overview We acknowledge that the proposed Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments are not yet approved but still receiving refinement ( @twblack88). However, we feel is it abrasive and harmful to morale when the offboarding here could have followed the new proposed template but did not. Specifically, we would have appreciated some plan in the optional section: Suggest a path to accountability for the Core Unit, so the offboarding proposal could be withdrawn. In light of the discussions about cost control, as well as adjustments in the service offerings provided, ISCU has decided to formally propose the following changes with regards to its budget.  Immunefi Services Immunefi Services currently provides priority services to IS-001. This includes:  Incidence response assistance to IS-001 as part of the Security Stakeholder Alignment cross-core unit project Premium triaging service of all bug reports Priority provision of postmortems for high and critical vulnerabilities Operational audit (charged separately) Direct assistance to core units as needed  Overall, we can reduce this to:  Standard provision of postmortems for critical vulnerabilities (standard and free at Immunefi for all clients) Premium triaging service for web  The premium triaging service for web is currently on a trial basis for free. After 1 month of trial, IS-001 will determine, together with steward core units, whether this premium triaging service will be required. It should be noted that the reduction of these services by Immunefi Services does not mean that IS-001 will no longer provide its assistance in this capacity. This saves MakerDAO USD 5 000/month or USD 10 000/month if the premium web triaging service is not continued after the free trial.  ChaosLabs When setting up the MakerDAO bug bounty program, as well as IS-001 itself, we acknowledged that bug bounty hunters may be deterred from working on MakerDAO smart contracts given that it has a rigorous ongoing audit process and has a relatively established level of recognition in the space, thus already likely being targeted by some of the top blackhat hackers in the space. The tools that ChaosLabs presented allowed for easier testing, and thus easier bug hunting. We had reasoned that by making it easier to hunt for bugs, it would lower the hesitation for whitehat hackers to spend time on MakerDAO. However, it\u2019s taken some time for ChaosLabs to get the tool running ideally for IS-001. There was a temporary pivot to allow triagers to test the tools first before releasing it to the public, also in order for ChaosLabs to get more feedback for this purpose, but this became deemed unnecessary. While looking for cost-cutting measures, we have decided to reassess our engagement with ChaosLabs. This potentially saves MakerDAO USD 54 000. We will consider engaging with ChaosLabs again at a later date and when they are ready, but will not assume that this outlay is already approved. We will create a signal request to open a grant program when that time comes. CC: @benhoneill  DeFi Safety DeFi Safety was originally brought on to assist with the fire drills, but there was some miscommunication with regards to how these would be conducted, and it turns out that their expertise does not fit with the fire drill plans we had and thus their services will not be needed. This was applicable with both the discovery fire drills, used for discovering issues and learning more about the processes of the core units we worked with, or the actual preparedness drills, which were meant to test the preparedness of the team. Additionally, with the reduction of Operational Audits, where they were supposed to provide scoring systems for the various core units receiving the service, their services on that end will no longer be required. DeFi Safety, however, provided much-needed assistance in creating internal documentation for the core unit. It\u2019s also noteworthy that despite a budget of USD 10 000/quarter, we have only used up the budget worth of about half of a quarter (USD 5 100) for the whole existence of IS-001. This saves MakerDAO USD 10 000/quarter  ChainSecurity ChainSecurity is only brought in on an as-needed basis given the changes on process with how smart contract bug reports are submitted, whereby steward core units receive the bug report before ChainSecurity. So far, IS-001 has only paid CHF 3538.15 (about 1:1 to the USD when invoiced) throughout the existence of the core unit. This is significantly lower than the allocated USD 10000/month originally allocated. We can spend at most USD 30k per quarter. The potential savings to MakerDAO is ambiguous due to the amount being used only on an as-needed basis and the costs are just transferred over to another core unit if it\u2019s completely removed from IS-001.  Deputy Facilitator Joshua Pritikin, Deputy Facilitator of IS-001, will reduce from 1.0 to 0.8 FTE (4 days a week). His responsibilities are largely unchanged. He will provide service at a slightly reduced service level due to a reduction of 0.2 FTE. This saves MakerDAO 2000/month and 3.2 MKR/year.  Facilitator Travin Keith, Facilitator of IS-001, will reduce his fee to USD 0/month. In the past, his compensation was sent to Immunefi services. However, he still has a motivation for continuing his involvement, though reduced, due to the interest of Immunefi to retain MakerDAO as a client. He will then hand over most responsibility of the operation of the core unit to Joshua, Deputy Facilitator of IS-001, including the attendance of Mandated Actors calls. Responsibility for IS-001\u2019s portion of bug report facilitation will also be transferred fully to Joshua, in addition to him being primarily responsible for providing security support to the various core units, especially with the steward core units with regards to the bug bounty program. He will, however, maintain signing power and be reachable for assistance when deemed necessary by Joshua. Travin also foregoes all MKR compensation as stated in MIP40c3-SP41: Immunefi Security Core Unit MKR Budget - IS-001. This saves MakerDAO USD 2084/month and 3.2 MKR/year.  Summary The minimum spend of the Core Unit is reduced from 22k per month (10k to Immunefi, 12k staff) to 8k per month for staff.  If @Ippy sees fit to withdraw this MIP (& sister), that would be appreciated. Bug bounty programs and fire drills don\u2019t run themselves. If you offboard ISCU then you may need to orchestrate budget increases for DUX & PE. ",

                    "content": "Hello, Apologies for my late reply here.  Could you clarify what responsibility is retained with you as the facilitator of the Immunify CU?  With the Immunefi CU, I still am part of the multisig and consult with Joshua with regards to bug reports that he needs assistance on. This means that MakerDAO is the only bug bounty program on Immunefi right now with a Co-Founder who\u2019s directly involved in its maintenance and management as I\u2019ve largely moved on to areas of our business outside the bug bounty platform. I am also still in charge of activities of the CU, should there be decisions on the services that it offers to the ecosystem.  Could you also share your views on the transfer of responsibility in light of the recently failed MIP41c4-SP34 4?  I\u2019m a bit disappointed in it, but I understand and respect the viewpoints of the MKR delegates. During the onboarding process and the subsequent operation of IS-001, I didn\u2019t consider myself as well as other Facilitators to have that much weight in terms of being seen as representatives of the community (me even less than others), given that I was informed and agreed that it would be good to have core units competing against each other among other things. That said, I acknowledge my mistake in not understanding as well that this identity and its associated expectations from the community would be in place in these early stages of increased decentralization. It is, after all, reasonable to expect that the early leaders of the early core units would have to have greater importance placed on facilitator selection. I look forward to seeing Psychonaut continue doing a good job in his role and hope that in the future, should a similar MIP come into vote, it will be more positive to his appointment as Facilitator.
