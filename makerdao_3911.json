While they are good in theory, they have to be strategic. For example, just yesterday, we saw how DeFi Education Fund and its related people sold a large portion of UNI they got from Uniswap governance despite the governance got the commitment to not dilute it right away and allocate for 4-5 years.   twitter.com    Defi Education Fund @fund_defi    With the help of @GenesisTrading, we sold 500k UNI for ~$10.2M USDC in order to fund the efforts of the Defi Education Fund.   In the next 24 hours, we will be sending 500k UNI to Genesis and receiving ~$10.2M USDC in return.   9:55 PM - 12 Jul 2021           60                12              twitter.com    Igor Igamberdiev @FrankResearcher    1/3  Looks like Larry Sukernik, one of the multi signers behind the $20M DeFi education fund, dumped UNI five hours before the $10M OTC sale. https://t.co/JWlxZC2L4Q   12:23 PM - 13 Jul 2021           220                48            And while I can\u2019t tell details while working at the Maker Foundation and previous blockchain career, you can probably guess there been countless broken promises and commitments when dealing with other entities, some even despite legal contracts. The truth is people are self-interested and usually so are their entities. If there\u2019s no way to keep them accountable, they will take advantage of it. The issue is especially acute as DAO doesn\u2019t have many ways to enforce such. And even if DAO can let\u2019s say sue them, bringing lawsuit itself is difficult and expensive and can backfire in public sentiment (as they will portray themselves as \u201cvictims\u201d). Therefore, while it\u2019s good to see some are quite enthusiastic about initiatives, the governance might have an expensive lesson if not reviewed thoroughly. ",

The reason why the community is not aware of especially grantees is because many of them failed to gain traction and also many don\u2019t even promote as such. For example, Pool Together which used to promote heavily that it\u2019s supported by Maker doesn\u2019t even list there anymore.  image1279\u00d7511 20.8 KB  It was an extremely unpopular opinion back in the Foundation, and it probably still is but I strongly believe Maker should invest rather than giving out blank checks in grants. Sure, it works out for some but investment is a better way to ensure the Maker community has influence over projects and also profit when they become successful. There are numerous DeFi protocols that Maker provided grant that released tokens and they could worth a lot but we didn\u2019t enjoy such despite supporting early because it had no agreement like that. Now a bit less unpopular opinion is the Maker community really should revisit grant / hackathon and see what went well and what didn\u2019t work. Because if not, we are just writing checks that are happy to switch to any others that provide better terms any second. ",

The issue is Maker has been funding public goods but then doesn\u2019t have good ways to mitigate Free-rider problem (which arises in public goods in legacy economy as well). For example, if you look at highly celebrated grantees like Pool Together and Opolis, they started with Dai as only option after getting the grant but soon expanded to various stablecoins. And now USDC usage on their platforms are several times bigger than Dai. Of course, there are different ways to view this. Some can argue there are plenty of public goods that Maker system is also getting benefit without directly paying for. In addition, even if let\u2019s say other stablecoins become dominant in grantee protocols, they still open up interesting opportunity for Dai. However, it is important to recognize the benefit of grants to Maker is not always straight forward and thus once again, crucial to review thoroughly. ",

As far as I know, MakerDAO did not contribute any funds to this endeavor but the product can grow DAI usage to be on par with the VIX in TradFi. I believe HanfleFi is also using DAI for their tokenized forex protocol. Something which I would like to see built in-house by MakerDAO, but it might save resources in redundancy if we actually made a strategic investment in its development.

Anyone telling you otherwise is either uninformed or not telling the full story.   I mean if you want to call other protocols centralized than yea\u2013I agree\u2013ALL DeFi protocols are currently centralized\u201350% of DeFi is composed/backed by USDC. But give credit where credit is due. AAVE is doing well. Can\u2019t take that away from them. Decentralized or not. ",

I have a lot of admiration for what they\u2019ve done since the EthLend ICO and subsequent pivot (and I\u2019ve used their protocol a ton in the past) though we shouldn\u2019t kid ourselves that they operate in a decentralized fashion. You buy Aave, you are making a bet on Aave, Inc. to deliver on promises to accrue value in the token, and Stani and Co. are the team working behind the scenes to vote in what they want. There is nothing wrong with that;  it is simply a less risk-averse approach to regulatory developments than we are accustomed to here. NB: marketing/pumping things like credit delegation swaps to retail on Twitter rubs me the wrong way. ",
