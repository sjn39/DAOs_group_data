It\u2019s crazy to me that every tx gets a global lock by default. Being familiar with a UTXO model, I remember I was shocked. No wonder gas is high \u2014 you should have to pay out the nose for that privilege. Paying for the scope of a tx\u2019s state lock would open up more parallelizable verification, etc, but it\u2019d also be more fair to folks who are just pushing tokens around and are only touching a single contract. It\u2019d also be satisfying to see our flash loan arb friends pay for the superpower.  @prestwich responded:  there\u2019s some movement in this direction with eip 2930. But it\u2019s not sufficient. Stateless eth had some shakeups lately and I wouldn\u2019t count on it being a thing for several years  ",

The author of the post questions why every transaction gets a global lock by default and suggests that paying for the scope of a transaction's state lock would open up more parallelizable verification and be more fair to those who are only touching a single contract. A third party responds by mentioning some movement in this direction with EIP 2930 but also notes that it's not sufficient and that stateless ETH has had some shakeups lately.",
