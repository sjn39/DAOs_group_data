                    "content": "Hey all, As some of you may have noticed, @Risk-Core-Unit has been fairly active in developing risk analytics dashboards such as https://maker.blockanalitica.com. Risk analytics dashboards are only part of our Core Unit\u2019s general mandate which is primarily focused on risk parameter proposals and collateral evaluations. When Maker started integrating with other protocols, such as the Aave D3M integration, our development part of the team began focusing more on external protocols by collecting data and by developing various risk metrics that benefits our analyst part of the team when proposing Maker specific parameters. While developing the necessary infrastructure we realised that such dashboards and data could become beneficial to other external communities as well. We were also told that grants could be received if we produced more extensive dashboards. We have recently prepared dashboard mockups for Aave. We received positive feedback for their grant approval. The development of such a dashboard would require at least another developer FTE on our side with the target timeline of 2 to 3 months. Our idea is to grow our development part of Block Analitica with external resources financed by non-Maker related budgets if such opportunities exist. The reason we are writing this post is to ask how the community feels about us scaling activities outside Maker? To my knowledge there are some cases in the current Core Unit structure where certain companies have outside business, while the contributors and costs are supposedly separate from Maker affiliated teams and budgets. Yet, I wasn\u2019t yet able to find a more formal discussion about this topic on forums, and hence we are starting one. Ideally we\u2019d want any activity outside Maker to also have benefits for Maker. In this current case, the Aave analytics tool should help us with D3M risk monitoring, while the extra resource needed would be essentially financed by Aave. But since we might get requests from other protocols, the question becomes whether the Maker community and token holders would still support this while not having any clear benefits, even though the financing is done by external sources and contributors on our side would work separately from the Maker team. We are also thinking how this concept of business development fits in Rune\u2019s concept of MetaDAOs. In our view Maker would share the upside of our success. After all, Maker enabled us to become one of the most professional risk teams within DeFi. We are getting a lot of requests \u2013 in part because of the quality of our work, but probably also because we are branded as \u201cMakerDAO\u2019s risk team\u201d. Last note, I am sure someone will address the potential conflict of interest involved here. This should be mitigated by the fact that contributors working on such projects will be external to the Maker part of the team and will be working on projects primarily involved in dashboard development and not governance type of work.

                    "content": "This is a difficult issue. My default stance is that I think anything related to Maker should stay focused on Maker. That means I think delegates should be delegates for Maker only, and that Core units should be only working for Maker. This is to be able to avoid conflicts of interest. If you serve two protocols, how do you divide your effort between them? If one stands to gain at the expense of the other, what do you do? There is also the matter that it seems a little strange that Maker should pay the expenses for a Core Unit and then have them work somewhere else, in a way subsidizing other protocols. All this being said. Actors involved with Maker is gaining valuable skills that can be utilized by others. As long as capacity is scaled similarly and financed externally we\u2019re left with the conflict of interest issue. A while back I wrote about financing support CUs. I think that type of CU would be well suited both into Rune\u2019s MetaDAO plan and before that to provide their services outside of Maker. A potential solution to the conflict of interest could be to have as seperate teams as possible within the CU. Each dedicated to their own protocol or project. Overall I think it should be acceptable for both delegates and CUs to provide services outside of Maker, even though I prefer them not to. ",
