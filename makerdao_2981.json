                    "content": "Summary This post is the result of my diving into the differences between different IRV implementations and comparing those to the implementation we are currently using. As I looked into it more, it became necessary to communicate the context around the various implementation options and how this relates to our goals in governing MakerDAO. The TL;DR of it is that the current implementation we are using is neither a \u2018correct\u2019 implementation nor is it the implementation that I think makes the most sense for Maker Governance. There will be no more IRV Ranked Polls until we determine how to move forward. Goals Our Goals Ensure executives pass I\u2019ve covered the reasons for this elsewhere, but I\u2019ll reiterate them here. Due to the executive voting system, we are forced to bundle the results of multiple polls into one executive. Having executives that do not pass can be extremely costly in terms of time and effort for Governance and the Mandated Actors. If we allow changes without majority support into the executive vote, it weakens its chance of passing. Having an executive that doesn\u2019t pass is not good because each week of governance costs time, effort, and gas. Here is a brief layout of the usual costs of a week\u2019s worth of polling and executive:  I spend between 2-4 hours each week writing, reviewing, and submitting polls. 1 hour is spent by various people reviewing polls or executive text. Smart Contracts spend time preparing the executive contents (new collateral) and creating the executive spell itself. (Not sure how long this takes, but it\u2019s not a trivial process.) Gas costs are paid for submitting polls and executive spells.  If an executive fails to pass, depending on the contents, we have to:  Attempt to figure out why it didn\u2019t pass. Attempt to determine what should be included in the next executive  Do we repeat failed contents? Do we exclude potentially controversial things?   Potentially repeat polls with fewer / more options. Repeat Smart Contracts Domain work re-writing an executive with similar contents. Governance needs to vote again on a similar set of things. Gas costs are paid again.  Ensure executives contain majority-desired changes We want to make sure that if there is a majority of MKR Holders that want a specific change then that change is included in the executive. Differences in Goals IRV as generally described is written for use in the real world. Real-world systems of electing governments have a different set of requirements. First, elections are expensive, nations cannot afford to have elections fail to resolve. Despite the above costs, Maker\u2019s polling process is much cheaper to operate. Second, elections are the final part of the governance process for most nations. Maker has approval voting (executives) subsequent to polling votes. Executives require more MKR voting for them than is voting for a previous executive. In other words, it requires a majority of active MKR to pass an executive. What is IRV and how does it work? I\u2019m not going to spend time writing a worse explanation than already exists on the internet for the purposes of this post. Here are some links that explain it in depth. If you\u2019re not terribly interested in the details, you can skip to the Commonalities section below: Links Description of Process Worked Example Commonalities  All Instant Run-off Vote implementations include the concept of rounds. If after a round, the leading option does not meet some criteria, an option is eliminated and votes are redistributed to those voters\u2019 next-ranked candidates. All Instant Run-off Vote implementations allow voters to rank their preferences.  Key Variations Rank all vs. Rank any Rank-All In this variation, voters are forced to rank all the options in their order of preference. However, this does mean that voters are forced to rank options that they would not accept when compared to the status quo. Rank-Any In this variation, voters are able to rank as many options as they want (including only 1.) However, this means that this implementation can resolve without a Total-Majority. Shrunk Majority vs Total Majority Shrunk-Majority In this variation, a majority of the remaining-non-discarded votes is used to determine whether the rounds have concluded and the winner decided. Using a shrunk-majority an outcome is guaranteed, however, it is not guaranteed that the outcome is preferred to the status quo by a majority of the total voters. Total-Majority In this variation, a majority of the total votes is used to determine whether the rounds have concluded and the winner decided. Using a total-majority, an outcome is not guaranteed. However, if there is an outcome, then it represents something the majority of voters favor. Stop Criteria Stop when x remain If there are x options remaining after a round, the calculation is complete. Stop-On-Total-Majority If an option has a majority of the total votes after a round, the calculation is complete. Stop-On-Shrunk-Majority If an option has a majority of the remaining votes after a round, the calculation is complete. Implementation Our Current Implementation Rank-Any, Total-Majority, Stop-On-Total-Majority, Stop-when-2-Remain Advantages  Rank-Any allows users to explicitly express their opposition to an option.  Disadvantages  A majority outcome is not guaranteed when combining Total-Majority and Rank-Any. Cannot require a majority outcome given that it isn\u2019t guaranteed to find one if it exists. Stop-When-2-Remains means that rounds will end when a majority could have been found (transfer from the lower of the last remaining options.) Isn\u2019t actually a \u2018correct\u2019 implementation of IRV.  \u2018Correct\u2019 Implementation #1  Rank-All, Total-Majority, Stop-On-Total-Majority Advantages  Always resolves with a majority.  Disadvantages  Forces users to rank options they do not want to vote for in an executive vote. The majority it resolves with is manufactured from the inability of users to express opposition. It is guaranteed to provide the preferred option, but not that that option is preferred by a majority to the status quo.  \u2018Correct\u2019 Implementation #2  Rank-Any, Shrunk-Majority, Stop-On-Shrunk-Majority Advantages  Always resolves with a majority or plurality. Allows voters to express opposition to options by not ranking them.  Disadvantages  Plurality resolution can lead to failed executive bundles as detailed above.  My Preferred Implementation of \u2018IRV\u2019 for Maker Rank-Any, Total-Majority, Stop-On-Total-Majority, Stop-When-1-Remains Advantages  Always identifies and resolves with a majority if one exists (due to Stop-When-1-Remains.) Plurality changes will not proceed to an executive vote.  Disadvantages  Can fail to resolve. Isn\u2019t actually a \u2018correct\u2019 implementation of IRV.  My Desired Voting System: Approval Voting Approval voting is the type of voting we use on the forum with multiple-choice polls. Voters vote for everything they are willing to accept. The winner is the option with the highest support and a majority. If there is no majority, the change does not proceed to the executive. Advantages  Approval voting is less complex than IRV The process is easy to understand. The outcome is easy to understand. It leads to the least-objectionable outcome winning the poll, avoiding controversy.  Disadvantages  It does not allow voters to rank preferences.  Next Steps There will be no more IRV Ranked Polls until we determine how to move forward. The current implementation is both not technically correct, and not optimal for our governance process. The current implementation of IRV is not guaranteed to find a majority if one exists, and including plurality options in an executive risks the executive failing to pass. I\u2019d like to hear people\u2019s thoughts on the above suggestions. If people want to pursue any of these options, please create a signal request. If a signal request isn\u2019t created in the next week, we\u2019ll start using my preferred implementation of IRV. ",

In practice I already have a huge amount of influence over which polls use which voting method. Though if someone is dead set on using a certain type then I\u2019m usually fine with it. The issue with using the current version is that I can no longer say that \u2018This poll must resolve with a majority or it will not proceed to an executive\u2019 when I\u2019m aware that the frontend will stop looking for a majority when there are only two options remaining. Technically it would be possible to do the calculation manually, but given what happened last week I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the confusion and potential conflict. If governance does not want to micromanage the implementation then we can switch to the suggested fix and start using it next week. If governance does want to give further input they are able to do so, but I don\u2019t think it makes sense to continue using the current version given that we now know it isn\u2019t reliable in all cases.     ultraschuppi:  What about just keeping the current implementation until we have something \u201cbetter\u201d?   I think I covered this above, but to be explicit, the current version is not guaranteed to find a majority if one exists. Any time we use this we\u2019ll need to manually check and public the results separately from the frontend. It just seems like it will lead to more confusion.     ultraschuppi:  Btw\u2026 rank all is ok from my point of view too.

If the community can reach strong consensus on an option such that we can offer a binary poll that\u2019s almost always better than having a ranked poll on-chain.

I know we want to reduce the chance that executives are blocked because we didn\u2019t seek a majority, that is a reasonable concern, and is also almost the entire reason we poll on-chain prior to an executive; however, I think it\u2019s more important that polls resolve than we attempt to seek a majority in this case.  That is, I think we have high constraints on our schedules, and while the work put into signaling for something isn\u2019t as much work as a state or national election, it is highly disruptive to that process to not resolve one way or the other. I think if this as having faith in the mechanism.  We may not reach a majority supporting the overall option, but the non-winners can have faith that the process worked as defined.  In the same way randomly rolling for gear in an MMO can produce unfair outcomes, the fairness in the process of randomly rolling leads to faith in the system. Once we have DssGov, and can unbundle executives, we would no longer have the majority support constraint on the entire executive.  Under this new regime, we are certainly better to go with Rank-Any, Shrunk-Majority, Stop-On-Shrunk-Majority.  For now, so long as our polls always have a \u201cDo Nothing\u201d option, I would favor finality in the poll over a majority. If someone would be so kind as to add the option for Rank-Any, Shrunk-Majority, Stop-On-Shrunk-Majority to any signal polling, I would be very appreciative.  I understand that we would need to change our implementation, as it is currently Rank-Any, Total-Majority, Stop-On-Total-Majority, Stop-when-2-Remain.  In that case, I think we can do what @g_dip said in the interim.  When signaling, we should specify if something must resolve and make it a binary poll. I won\u2019t go into other options I\u2019m not in favor of because of time, but I will say I would strongly discourage a system that forces MKR holders to rank all options.  There is just no way I will ever choose the \u201cprint unbacked DAI\u201d option, even if I made it my last choice.  Joking aside, this is mostly because of the UX burden of making everyone rank everything in the poll.

Assuming we do plan to move to Shrunk-Majority (or anything that ensures a winner) after DssGov, I\u2019d rather have no more IRV polls in the meantime. Another debate like we just had would be a huge distraction.

Personally I am 100% with this solution due to its simplicity. More sophisticated voting systems are cool, but realistically we can\u2019t expect voters to spend 2 hours on wikipedia to read all the (changing over time?) details of the voting system. So, SIMPLE + CLEAR = GOOD.     Aaron_Bartsch:  Maybe add a signal request to postpone using it or changing the methodology? I\u2019m not a fan of this authoritative decision making.   I agree with @Aaron_Bartsch on this. We all understand this is important and that you have given a lot of thought on this  topic.

We can\u2019t always go for multi-select signaling and then just take the most voted option from the signal to the on-chain polling. So far, @LongForWisdom did a great job on deciding which way to go for all the previous onchain votes (and to be really explicit: also for the problematic one!).      LongForWisdom:  If a signal request isn\u2019t created in the next week, we\u2019ll start using my preferred implementation of IRV.   If we need to signal on IRV implementations (and I am totally fine with not doing that an defaulting to @LongForWisdom preferred implementation), I would go for:  our current implementation - it did work, good enough (yes, i don\u2019t think that a poll always need to resolve. if voters are unwilling to compromise, nothing happens) correct implementation 1 (because I like that voters need to rank all options. kind of guarantees that they make an educated decision).
