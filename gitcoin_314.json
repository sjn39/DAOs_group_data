To do so, we are requesting a budget of $414,041 (down from $471,949 in the initial draft budget). Our top priorities for this season include:  A successful marketing push at ETHDenver, including:  Development of a microsite that will live at evolution.gitcoin.co featuring launch of Grants Stack, our new visual identity and Quadratic Funding Record release with Metalabel Running the Schelling Point conference (with the support of Supermodular as a contractor) A PR/media relations push (with the support of YAP Global) Coordinated efforts around consistent messaging for anyone speaking on stage at ETHDenver & bolstering these talks with related online content to capture audiences not present at ETH Denver   Launching a new gitcoin.co website Finalize the Gitcoin Grants Stack, Allo Protocol, and Passport branding strategies and visual identities Launch the first version of a living Impact Report that highlights the success of the Gitcoin Grants Program Relaunch Passport and double down on marketing/education efforts from a content and creative perspective Provide marketing support for the Grants Program in April   Amount MMM\u2019s S17 budget is $414,041 (-12.27% change vs S16 budget). After accounting for remaining budget & reserves, MMM is requesting $122,069 for Season 17 from the treasury.  Milestone Report All in all, MMM performed well in terms of tracking to S16 OKRs. There were many changing priorities over the course of the season which resulted in a lot of . There were also several  that mostly had to do with metrics that were mostly out of MMM\u2019s control. This is a great learning for the team to set OKRs directly related to outputs within our control. The goal isn\u2019t to get all  but rather aim for 70% completion to ensure we continue to set a high bar for ourselves. Success Incomplete but will hit goal  Incomplete, will not hit goal  Canceled     Initiative/Dept Objectives Past Season Key Result     Protocols Refine product-market fit for Gitcoin\u2019s protocols. Iterate on product branding to support a clear protocol narrative and to create compelling visual identity.  Create marketing collateral, market education, and coordinated & effective product launches.    Continue protocol audience/persona research  Continue competitor analysis for Grants, Project and Passport   Lead and create Passport Product Marketing Fit Pyramid definition for both Developers and Passport Holders  Launch Protocols website(s) * These pages will not be fully complete until S17. MMM has just finalized a full marketing brief for Allo Protocol, Grants Stack and Passport, and are in the process of creating one for the Program. Information from these briefs will live, for now, in a microsite being launched in time for ETHDenver.  Develop influencer relations strategy (PR focused, not paid growth) * We did some preliminary work on this and, after consulting with others in the DAO, we decided to postpone this activity. Alternatively, we will engage with YAP Global to bolster PR efforts for the Denver launch and explore incorporating more media relations for select, high-priority marketing comms campaigns.  Create robust product marketing plan for Passport * Instead of a full plan, we created a launch plan based on the value proposition work we did alongside GPC. A more robust product marketing plan will be developed in S17/S18 once we validate our hypotheses around audiences, key messages and value propositions. We also experienced turnover on the Passport team which contributed to a slow down and pivot around timing.  Start a creative refresh for Passport and other Protocols * Due to capacity issues and longer-than-expected feedback and review periods, we were only able to fully complete an overall Gitcoin brand visual refresh without diving into our products. Creative refreshes for our Protocols have been mapped out. These will be fully complete by our Denver launch in early S17.  Initiate at least 3 co-marketing initiatives with Passport integration partners * We only managed to initiate and execute on 2 co-marketing initiatives (Orbis.club and Snapshot).  Publish at least 2 Passport case studies * Case studies are currently in development and will be complete and published in S17.  Develop customer journey map and proposed funnel metrics for round operators and project owners (protocol)    Programs Grow awareness and comprehension of the transition of Gitcoin Grants to the protocol.Create awareness & drive participation for a successful Alpha round (\u201cGR16\u201d).   Develop a communications plan to socialize our transition and mitigate risk Provide minimal promotional support for the alpha round in January  Provide promotional support for the UNICEF round in December  Release 1st version of a \u201cGrants Program Impact Report\u201d * We underestimated the scope of this project and lift required to execute on it. We are set to deliver this in S17 instead.  Begin development of a Grantee and Partner testimonial repository * Since creating this outcome, the project was more fully scoped and it was determined that this repository would exist within the Impact Report.  Continue program audience/persona research  Support the development of an overall program & partnerships strategy  * After speaking to the PGF team on both fronts (program & partnership), we determined that it would be best to pursue this once there was more clarity on future plans for the program.  Create a program brand strategy & aligned visual identity * Similar to the previous point, the changing nature of the program inhibited our ability to move forward on this outcome and it was decided that we would postpone this for the time being until a more complete vision for the program is crystalized.  Develop customer journey map and proposed funnel metrics for grantees and donors * We completed the customer journey and funnel mapping for donors, but not grantees. We decided internally that doing this work for grantees is out of scope and should live within the domain of PGF.    Community engagement Grow the Gitcoin community, deepen engagement, & improve brand affinity.  Detailed report on the outcomes of the execution of our Season 16 community engagement strategy, which will include a recounting of all the activities + links to recordings, of sessions held, surveys of community members and 1:1 interviews, and other findings. Revised Season 17 community engagement strategy informed by the report\u2019s findings * See an explanation outlined in this post on the gov forum. We intend to recommit to this outcome in S17.  Create and begin to execute content roadmap leading up to Protocols Launch * On track to begin publishing in S17.  Finalize overall Gitcoin branding strategy, and begin implementing the relevant changes  Brand & creative designs for Schelling Point main event  Maintain an average engagement rate of 2.5% per post on Twitter  A series of content experiments to determine our most impactful content leading up to S17    MMM OS Refine our OS for a thriving MMM Workstream & DAO.We will have a world-class marketing team who is working in thriving partnerships across the DAO and in the broader web3 community.   Run an S16 peer performance review* Holding off since almost the entire team will be meeting IRL in Denver and a similar type of review will be conducted there  Collect monthly OS feedback  Streamline \u201cproject management\u201d process      Our S16 Wins! (index of key outputs created)  Assembled a SSOT for Gitcoin Grants Stack  dApp suite positioning Value prop design Customer journey mapping   Assembled a SSOT for Allo Protocol  Naming process complete for Grants Allo Protocol   Assembled a SSOT for Passport  Value proposition design   Gitcoin brand strategy refresh  Visual identity refresh & Brand Book (v1) Donor audience profile (v1) Program manager audience profile (v1) Community Hub created Content performance analysis Channel audit Report on community engagement at Gitcoin Program partner marketing guide  Content Style Guide (v1) Organized our rich history if memes into our Meme Forge Implemented behavioural tracking to improve the performance of the Grants Explorer   S17 Goals To start to sensemake how we are performing as a brand, this season we are going to be setting and tracking high-level metrics to measure how we are performing overall as a company. Content metrics are based on the reporting done by our content team about email, Twitter and blog content. Please follow the link for a more detailed explanation on how these metrics came about and what they mean.     Channel Measurement S15 S16 S17 Goal     Gitcoin Twitter Impressions 5.3MM 4.3MM 5.6MM    Engagement rate 2.5% 4% 4%   Gitcoin Passport Impressions - 261,000 500,000    Engagement rate - 4% 4%    Follower count - 3,700 10,000   Email Open rate - 16.43% 16%    Click-thru rate - 0.52% 1%    Unsubscribe rate - 0.29% 0.3%   Blog Total blog post views 64,014 76,326 85,000    Avg time spent on page 39 seconds 50 seconds 60 seconds    A few notes for the outcomes above:  We are not overly concerned with tracking followers on our main Gitcoin account - this is a vanity metric that is not indicative of our performance We are, however, tracking followers on our Passport account since it is a nascent account A 4% engagement rate is incredibly high, and maintenance for next season on our main Gitcoin account is an ambitious goal Our email open rates are well above industry average and we plan to maintain that rhythm Unsubscribe rates will likely go up as we continue to clean and segment our list more carefully to ensure its quality  A note for the outcomes with respect to the product initiatives below:  We will be announcing Allo Protocol at ETHDenver but we will not be prepared to heavily market Allo Protocol in S17. Rather, we will be working with the Allo team clarify a GTM strategy (including determining product positioning, messaging, clarifying early success metrics) to help us determine and preemptively test and grow the appropriate marketing channels.

In S17, we are taking on a structure that we think will ease this tension. The graphic below highlights our current WS structure. In it you\u2019ll see key points of contact for external Workstreams. You\u2019ll also see a \u201cMarketing guild\u201d (has not yet started) and a \u201cDesign guild\u201d (already underway) - a new kind of structure that we\u2019ll experiment with as we head into a business-unit-structure future.  MMM Structure Jamboard1920\u00d71496 125 KB  What\u2019s new:  Each product (including our program) will have a designated point of contact: Guilds will encourage these individuals will also meet as a community of practice to support each other in accomplishing DAO-wide marketing goals. In the future, the guild may also have its own KPIs to work toward The brand & creative teams continue operating as an internal agency at the DAO  The primary purpose of this new structure is an attempt to better serve business units around the DAO. Whether these individuals live within the MMM or product team budget is up for discussion. ",

You\u2019ve really grown the team and brought rigorous practices to everything you deliver. Thank you. That said, I look at this budget and it\u2019s not something I feel comfortable endorsing. Not because I don\u2019t think this team delivers work but because I think the priorities of the team are misaligned with where we are as a DAO from a maturity standpoint and where we should be focusing. In addition, the size of MMM means there is a lot more management and organization needed across the team vs a leaner team where more of the team is focused on execution. This whole plan is very strategy focused vs action focused. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re there yet as a DAO, we\u2019re JUST starting to share our protocols with the world, get real-time feedback and make sure they are ready for launch. What we\u2019re marketing as a Program or a Protocol and who we are marketing it to in the next 6 months could look very different. This is where sections like the below, make me question if we\u2019re prioritizing the right things:   \u201cFinalize a complete marketing strategy for Gitcoin Grants Stack over the next 6 months.\u201d Feels like it\u2019ll be a detailed strategy for a product that is still being tested and changing shape / format / finding product market fit.   \u201cCreate Grantee Enablement plan and begin implementation\u201d feels like again more planning than execution. But should be something that doesn\u2019t take a huge amount of time to create and deliver.   Marketing for the program is 50% of the budget PGF has to do everything else from defining the strategy, engaging the community in determining the rounds, fundraising for the core rounds, establishing the featured rounds, grantee engagement and running the rounds. I\u2019d be comfortable if marketing was 25% of that.   MMM OS being more of your spend than Community engagement also feels way off based. What would it take to get MMM OS down to 5-8%?   I go back to the post Kyle shared 7 months ago about our budget split. How might things look if Product had more budget vs MMM? If we were further down the road with our protocols and revenue work, this would make sense as a budget but a pre-revenue alpha phase protocol and a close to $2M annual marketing budget feels off. How can we get faster iterations going with all the work MMM is doing? Even if it means potentially being a bit more scrappy? With this level of spend, I think more needs to be delivered or more of the marketing team should be supporting Product with their work. Appreciate this teams willingness to have these hard conversations and the consistent effort to deliver for the DAO. ",

As I was alluding to in today\u2019s Steward\u2019s call - it would be amazing to have the help perhaps of DAO Ops folks and others to begin to build towards greater predictability across the DAO. In other words, if we do X in marketing, will we (or our partners) see behavior Y such as greater contributions.  Basically can we bottle whatever worked with Unicef and open it for future partners? A unified view would then look at ok - X hit our website, and Y actually converted.  That would be metrics from each of the product teams afaik.  And then Z actually opened an issue / ticket / question - which could come from DAO Ops I think. ",

I\u2019ll say at the top that this is hard to review without a consolidated understanding of what Gitcoin DAO as a whole is trying to achieve this season, and therefore how MMM\u2019s goals would level into that. High level thoughts on this budget: 15% seems like a slightly high percentage of a total budget spent on marketing when we are pre-product. One thing I\u2019m confused about is that this budget is entirely headcount. I would usually not expect a marketing budget to be 100% headcount versus marketing costs (events, PR, advertising, community incentives, etc). Where does the cost of YAP global come out of? Or the cost of running Schelling Point? Are we sponsoring ETHDenver? I also don\u2019t really understand the budget breakdown per initiative and how it\u2019s determined given that the budget is all headcount. Also two simple questions - what does \u201cProgram\u201d mean and what does \u201cMMM OS\u201d mean? Thoughts on goals: This feels like a lot of OKRs for a small team. Could this be consolidated at all / more results oriented? I appreciate that these goals are more tangible than last season\u2019s, with more hard metrics. I think this could go further. I\u2019d like to see specific success metrics for:  Announce & launch Gitcoin Grants Stack at ETHDenver (see these are in the linked plan - great) Explore and test at least 1 new channel (media relations) to increase either the number or amount of donations in a round (what would we expect a successful increase to look like?) Create & execute a full Gitcoin Grants Festival marketing campaign Provide creative, social media and project management support and successfully run Schelling Point conference on Mar 2  I agree with some of @j9leger 's comments about the strategy focus as well. Finalizing a marketing strategy over 6 months doesn\u2019t feel like the phase we\u2019re in. This early in a product launch, I think it would be more useful to have a lightweight living document for strategy that could be created very quickly, and test and iterate, and focus on metrics as objectives versus creation of a strategy. I would suggest having high level KPIs that are tracked and reported on for MMM on a regular basis. It would be useful to see social media followers, engagement, email engagement, and how these grow over time as a part of these season budget requests / reports. This budget doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable but I feel I\u2019m missing some context / information.  Edit / update as I just spoke with @CoachJonathan Understood that we don\u2019t plan to have marketing spend this season because the team wants to understand product goals, audience personas etc. and how to target those before spending. This makes sense to me. I appreciate the part time focus of the headcount which allows for a lot of flexibility as well. Ultimately, my pov is that Gitcoin\u2019s brand is strong and it makes sense to maintain that and grow an engaged audience that current & future products can plug into for eventual monetization vs let that brand slip. That requires a content-focused team which is what @CoachJonathan has built. Looking forward to seeing integrated budget. ",

                    "content": "Goal: Launch Gitcoin Grants Stack public beta at ETH Denver. Generate wide-spread awareness of the product and attract first adopters. The likely projects and work stated here seems misaligned with the goal. If the sole focus on wide-spread awareness is dependent on the guest features on podcasts and publications, then why are the resources being utilized on marketing strategy development? Specific comments: From an execution perspective, the way this budget is prioritized concerns me. Way too much of the timeline and budget are using resources for strategy, and not nearly enough on execution. Based on metrics reported, there seems to have been minimal growth in audience traction and community traction. And there doesn\u2019t seem to be a prioritization on growth either. Approving a budget asking to spend 60% of monthly burn with no direct impact on growth, traction, or execution makes me uncomfortable. From where I\u2019m sitting the budget needs to be heavily revised. I\u2019m going to spend share what the goals are here versus what I\u2019d recommend for actual impact on traction and execution.  What it is: Finalize a complete marketing strategy for Gitcoin Grants Stack over the next 6 months. What it should be: Finalizing the marketing strategy in a week, and testing and experimentation of the marketing strategy with 6 months of execution and data for later revision.  Why is the strategy taking 6 months? What needs to be done specifically for the strategy to be done in 1 week and implementation for 6 months? What are the results of previous strategy showing? Do we have any past data or stats to indicate 6 months of strategy development is the way to go or that it will lead to results? In a space that\u2019s this fast-paced, anything done in 6 months will likely be outdated in by the end of those months. This timeline is moving as slow if not slower than massive \u201cold\u201d ineffective corporates.  What it is: Start the development of a marketing strategy for Allo Protocol in support of DevRel efforts What it should be: Implementation of a marketing strategy for Allo Protocol with X experiments for results or Y tangibles.  The marketing strategy should be a working document that can be iterated as needed, and with a lot more focus on executing on the experiments. What exactly does the development entail, and if the current process utilizes multiple contributors and capacity, then does the team need to be downsized or cut back OR placed in other areas of execution so it\u2019s easier?  Have Gitcoin contributors appear on at least 3 podcasts to speak about Gitcoin Grants Stack and/or the Allo Protocol Have Gitcoin contributors appear in at least 5 publications to speak about Gitcoin Grants Stack and/or the Allo Protocol.  Questions: Is YAP global responsible for placements for these or will they be coming from contributors? How does the budget split work here? Goal: Drive awareness and # of integrations of Passport Protocol. As a secondary objective, promote awareness of Passport Protocol to drive the number of individuals creating Gitcoin Passports and overall brand affinity.  Develop product marketing plan to drive:   25 total communities have integrated Passport 3 new Snapshot-level integrations 5000 followers on the @GitcoinPassport Twitter (currently at 3,000)  Questions: How many communities currently have Passport integrated and how many have Snapshot-level integration? Will PGF be supporting on this front in any way or will MMM be taking full responsibility for adoption for these metrics? Is the project the development of the marketing plan only or will it focus on implementation? \u2014\u2014 Goal: Promote the launch of the first full Gitcoin Grants Rounds & Festival run on Gitcoin Grants Stack  Engage in a light naming exercise to establish key brand elements for the festival Explore and test at least 1 new channel (media relations) to increase either the number or amount of donations in a round Create and execute a full Gitcoin Grants Festival marketing campaign Build out a \u201cfestival of rounds\u201d landing page featuring all accessible rounds  Questions: Why was the media relations not prioritized earlier and why isn\u2019t it a given as a standard Is the light naming exercise important? Overall, this is missing any mentions of tangibles on growth in audience or community for emails, socials, and engagement. There\u2019s only gitcoin passport with metrics, but what about the gitcoin account with the biggest audience?What are the tangibles to grow follower account, engagement, and overall activity on emails, content, and Twitter? Also to be noted: there was no support from MMM for the UNICEF round on PR, as they internally decided there wasn\u2019t capacity. What is the cost of loss of impact and ROI on a critical time-intensive period that could\u2019ve helped drive momentum had the round received more press? Is there an assessment of impact of decisions on other work streams and the later goals? Overall notes - why isn\u2019t there a focus on agility and growth? None of the goals and examples here besides the festival plan seem to be focused on delivery and this is very concerning. $471,949 FOR 14 part time contributors and 5 full-time folks for pushing out the website, promoting the festival, development of strategies, and community engagement seems unreasonable. This could be done way cheaper. While an additional $207,538 is being requested FOR PROJECTS => I\u2019m still not understanding for what? In good conscience, I can\u2019t see what justifies $686,239 for no actual impact on growth and traction over the next season. ",

                    "content": "Really appreciate the robust discussion here. First, on strategy - I certainly think questioning the duration of time spent developing a strategy is valid. Note that I believe this point:  Finalize a complete marketing strategy for Gitcoin Grants Stack over the next 6 months is more about defining a 6 month strategy, not taking 6 months to define a strategy - in the past season we\u2019ve been testing new frameworks for strategic thinking and planning, all of which are nimble and adaptable, ideal for quickly prototyping, testing & learning. This has helped us better align and engage both the internal DAO and our audiences more effectively. On the point of our work supporting product, a lot of the work we did this past season was supporting the product team in developing clearer product briefs that could then help inform our marketing materials. Next, on actions/tactics - there are some places where I agree we could be more explicit, and think we really need to look at tactics by channel and how spend breaks down by channel (even if it is just spend on headcount - how much of that headcount spend is being used on blog posts vs. twitter vs. visual assets). I also know where we are still requiring inputs from key partners (e.g., DevRel for the buildout of the Allo tactics); I think we\u2019re getting hung up on the use of the word strategy here when it fact I think ware just saying we\u2019re going to put a plan together with tactics then begin to execute that plan in collaboration with DevRel. So, noting we need to lead with more action oriented language in the future, but that actions/tactics are intended even if not fully finalized yet. But how are we measuring the success of our strategies? As a marketer used to metrics like recruitment/acquisition, conversion and retention, I\u2019ve been surprised that we arent regularly tracking those things here, nor are we using tactics that would allow us to track those with regularity or by channel (so how can we even validate that the headcount spend is better going towards blog posts vs. twitter posts if we don\u2019t have clear KPIs related to conversion funnel). I\u2019ve seen metrics on twitter engagement, I\u2019ve seen metrics on # of donors giving season over season, but overall the data is super fragmented and doesnt tell a clear story when it comes to the path to conversion. Additionally, we aren\u2019t a traditional web2 company - so what are the other metrics we care about? Community vitality? Referrals? Something about ecosystem growth? If our goal is to shift traditional economic models, why are only talking about the same KPIs? Moreover, our audiences are very segmented. I can be challenging to define metrics against all of them. But even if we take one audience -  program managers as our primary target next season - what metrics define success? How many are we trying to onboard? Is it through the program and if so, is that an MMM metric or a PGF metric? The marketing assets we create for the program contribute to the ability to secure matching partners, to inspire donors, to prepare grantees/applicants - but there are teams that also touch this work too, so those metrics arent wholly ours. Additionally, we\u2019re looking at a website for next season - are we driving traffic to it organically? Are we expected to invest in paid? What is the call to action when people arrive on the website, if there isnt a program running and the stack isnt usable autonomously yet? But even if it was, would the metric be getting users to sign up for more info? Would that count as conversion? Or would conversion be the moment their program is actually running? Defining these metrics - these goals - seems to me like more the job of the wider DAO than the job of MMM, especially since these goals tie to not just the MMM workstream, but all of the other workstreams. We can\u2019t adequately launch a campaign if we don\u2019t know the primary audiences we\u2019re targeting and what the CTA is - MMM has actually been pivotal in working with teams to hone in on those this past season, from what I\u2019ve seen. Furthermore, without clear KPIs, it\u2019s hard to define the minimum acceptable ROI on true marketing initiatives. So to expect specific ROI against tactics without these things feels impossible to me. All of this said, I do think this budget is high - but I am not in opposition to it given other budgets and our overall budgeting process. I think the burn rate of the entire DAO feels high given we are pre-revenue - but I don\u2019t think the solution is to go after each workstream, but instead to look at them all collectively against a set of goals (including revenue ones) the DAO has aligned on. It would make it easier to spot ways to cut costs, and could help prevent us from spinning our wheels unnecessarily (whilst getting paid to do so.) I\u2019d love to see us all be more action-results oriented moving forward, all in the same direction with a shared sense of common goals that are tied to metrics (vs. conceptual Essential intents - bc if the expectation is to define metrics/KPIs/ROI at the workstream level, then why would they not ladder up to ones at the DAO level) Last point - what\u2019s our frame of reference for this budget vs. other product/protocol DAOs? Seeing a lot of comparisons to lean startups but no references to how some of our decentralized peers have handled these things. Would love some examples (In my sleuthing I could only find this from Sushiswap which has 82% of total budget going to salaries SushiSwap DAO Budgets $5.2M, With 82% Going to Salaries - Blockworks - and am by no means comparing Gitcoin to Sushiswap, just calling out some additional market landscape context would be useful!)

We\u2019ve also broken down our initiatives in a bit more detail so that\u2019s made more clear. Speaking as a fellow steward here, I think the biggest risk of saying no to this proposal is that MMM is shipping quite a few pieces this season including:   Branding for our products/product launch   A much-needed website rehaul (it\u2019s seriously bad and we\u2019re working hard to ship something mid season)   No Grants Program marketing\u2013this round is a big deal as we\u2019re running our first full round on the protocol + with featured partners   We will lose momentum wrt the strides @garysheng has taken with Gitcoin Passport marketing in his short time being more embedded on that team   We will not finish the impact report that will act as both a case study and sales enablement tool in support of the partnerships team   We feel pieces are pretty integral to our success as a DAO next season. As an MMM lead, I think the biggest risk of not funding this proposal is loss of momentum. Not only for this particular team but also for our org. MMM has made immense strides in being able to serve the product (including program) teams needs. We are not only a hub for ground-breaking creativity (@birdsoar\u2019s recent posts illuminate this), we marketed 3(!!!) rounds last season to serve PGF\u2019s needs while driving market research, value proposition design work, product positioning, customer journey mapping, etc on the product side. I understand these efforts were made all last season, but I hope folks reading this can see the strategic value and execution support MMM provides to both product and program teams (teams who we feel are currently NOT aligned on a shared vision\u2026which is an environment that, as you can imagine, makes it difficult for marketing to \u201cget it right\u201d). Our team has foundational insights on our gaps and needs. We\u2019ll be meaningfully and mindfully working this season to maintain brand love, launch products and reinvent ourselves on the outside as we support the wider organisation to reflect and address strategic gaps on the inside.

How does the budget split work here?   @jpepper has been experimenting with media outreach this season with a bit of traction but we felt it was necessary to further experiment with a more experienced and well-connected team to test this channel as per internal requests. This season we are paying $5000 for each campaign we run with YAP. (I should mention to anyone reading this looking to work with YAP that this is not their standard rate  ) We will engage in 2 campaigns to start: the first for the launch of Grants Stack and the second for the re-launch of the grants program (potentially highlighting the impact report if possible). We will measure success by attempting to track clickthrough rates from articles, organic traffic upticks, # of features and some other vanity metrics they track.  Questions: Why was the media relations not prioritized earlier and why isn\u2019t it a given as a standard  We\u2019ve had failed experiments with media relations in prior seasons. Media relations is both incredibly expensive (whether we hire someone internally or hire an external agency) and difficult to measure. This is a top of funnel activity that requires clear goals and long-term KPIs to be able to measure success against. That said, I\u2019m not against PR. I would love to work with the partnerships team to identify when media relations campaigns are appropriate and what we hope to achieve as it relates to your goals and our larger organizational goals. Candidly, I was disappointed to learn about the expectations wrt media relations for the UNICEF round so last-minute. A marketing plan was shared that was signed off by both you and the UNICEF team a month before the round started with no mention of PR. When this expectation was communicated, we were simply not resourced well enough to support a meaningful media relations push so last-minute.     azeem:  Also to be noted: there was no support from MMM for the UNICEF round on PR, as they internally decided there wasn\u2019t capacity.   @azeem I\u2019m trying not to take this particular comment personally but I feel really hurt by this statement. I wrote a press release, put together a media list and spent my weekend cold emailing writers (even when I knew this approach would not work). I also asked our team do a last-minute grassroots media push as we prepared to launch the round. In hindsight, I regret not sitting down with you to properly assess needs and co-create a campaign plan together\u2013our marketing strategy team will be more present at product and program level this coming season so I hope that will solve these types of communication breakdowns.

If I were on the outside looking in, I might imagine MMM as a traditional consulting firm or office cubicle. Not so! Speaking as a contributor, I\u2019m familiar with the experience of adding value to the DAO through MMM, while wondering how our collective value is perceived or understood by neighboring workstreams. This revised budget proposal really speaks to the clarity of our goals this season. As for the DAO-wide proposal discussions\u2026 I\u2019ve been reading all of the workstream budget proposals, and reviewing feedback across the topic posts. What I\u2019m sharing isn\u2019t directed at any particular person(s) and is less about the conversation above, so I apologize if this pulls focus from the mmm budget. Drawing on my background in design research, I\u2019ve noticed a pattern and theme through the comments on the DAO-wide proposals. I\u2019m reflecting on my observations below. There\u2019s a strong and commonly expressed opinion that the workstreams are being more or less unreasonable with their budget requests: asking for too much, asking for more than they need on purpose, etc. Truthfully, I find it concerning for dao health when opinions are stated as fact, with no evidence to support the claim. The assumption I\u2019m reading is that workstreams are purposely asking for more than they need, almost maliciously so. That would seem true to me in a corporate environment. However, in a DAO, and from what I\u2019ve seen particularly of Gitcoin over the last two seasons, I haven\u2019t found this to be true. Nothing in the budgets has seemed exorbitant. Adjustments? Yes. Purposeful inflation or wildly irresponsible requests? No. The opinion seems to stem from fear, a scarcity mindset, a growing sense of unease about the unknown future, or maybe even a strong desire for prudence, which is understandable in a bear market. What I\u2019m observing about the budget process I would offer that workstreams are disincentivized to ask for excess money, given the considerable time and effort required to go through the budget process and the likelihood they\u2019ll need to revise it at least once or twice before the proposal is up for vote. Putting myself in the shoes of a workstream lead, the goal I would assume is to prepare a proposal for a functional budget that allows some room for inevitable change throughout a season. If you\u2019re someone who shares the excess budget request theory I outlined above: My offering here is to consider where your thinking originates. Accountability in the dao is awesome, and keeps us honest with ourselves, too. \u2013 Kudos to everyone sharing their passion for our DAO\u2019s success in the forum and aligning with compassion through tough budget conversations. I see you!  ",

Changes to the initial draft budget   Budget decrease - we have revised our budget down from a 0% change SoS to a -12% change.  Format of our goals for S17 - this is the most significant change and will, I think, address most of the concerns highlighted in the comments thus far. The format has been aligned to how other Workstreams have been posting. Apologies for the confusion our original structure may have caused (@azeem I think a lot of your concerns will be addressed by this, please comment if otherwise).  Community engagement has been removed - we are not resourced to meaningfully take this on, and will more specifically focus of grantee enablement for S17 (efforts are already underway).  S17 Structure and outlook - hopefully this gives everyone an opportunity to see where MMM\u2019s head is at in terms of moving with the DAO in future seasons. I think a lot of great conversations around this will be had at ETHDenver and I\u2019m looking forward to hearing everyone\u2019s perspectives and workshopping an ideal solution for the DAO.   Addressing comments  6 months to develop a strategy? No way! Well, this is embarrassing. As @J9leger @azeem and @ebransom have pointed out, 6 months to develop a strategy is way too long. I couldn\u2019t agree more! This was a big ol\u2019 typo. I\u2019m hoping the new format creates some clarity around what we are committed to.  Misaligned priorities     J9leger:  I think the priorities of the team are misaligned with where we are as a DAO from a maturity standpoint and where we should be focusing   I wanted to address this point in particular. In the last 24 hours, I have had the opportunity to speak to multiple stewards on their perspectives wrt this topic. I\u2019ve boiled this down to two general schools of thought:  We are pre-product org and our marketing spend is too big We are a growing org and our marketing spend is on point with that  I fully appreciate perspective 1) which is what @J9leger is advocating. I, on the other hand (as well as others who I hope will comment on their approval of this budget) have a strong conviction around 2) for a few different reasons:   Big marketing lifts: Though we are pre-product on Passport and Grants Stack/Allo, we have a very mature product which is our Grants Program. I write this without intending to sound cocky: Although the MMM team makes it look easy, each season this endeavour requires huge marketing lifts from a design, content, and coordination perspective.  Our brand: I believe that our brand is one of (if not THE) most important asset we have atm and I think diminishing our investment in it would result in an existential risk to the long-term success of our organization (especially in our pre-product/mature program stage).  Short-term gains, long-term pains: Looking at the new budget breakdown, you\u2019ll see that MMM is spending less than 25% of our budget on product - much of which was spent assembling product briefs over the last 2 seasons. The rest of the budget is set to help marketing our Grants Program, build our new website, further develop our brand, and launch an impact report. A cut to the marketing budget on a product basis will have a marginal effect on our budget in the short term, but will force us to let go of several high-performing, high context contributors that have helped get us to where we are and (still) have lots of work to do on driving awareness (and eventual adoption) of our products.  As an aside, I\u2019m getting very mixed messaging from across the DAO about where we are with product development. On one hand (from the product team) I\u2019ve been hearing that we are on track and ready for explosive growth. On the other hand I\u2019m hearing we are way behind and need to pull back big time on marketing. My suggestion would be for Stewards in their respective schools of thought to get aligned once and for all to create a clear picture of where we are now, where we are going and how soon we want to/plan to get there. This will help tremendously with planning our marketing spend and goal setting.  WRT Lean Teams  1) Skillset Diversity This is a common comment that I find myself fielding each season, and is also a common issue in the marketing industry as a whole. Marketing is a dynamic field that requires a wide-array of skillsets that are highly specialized and non-transferrable. We want our illustrators and designers doing illustrations and design, not coordinating or writing. Same goes for writers and coordinators - each person should be in the seat where they perform best. For example, having our animator Armando figuring out how to do front-end development in Webflow is going to go way slower than having a UX/UI person familiar with Webflow go in there and work their magic. Same goes for coordination work - though our designers can probably handle some basic project management, it is a way better use of their time (aka the DAO\u2019s money) to have them fully focused on doing what they do best. That\u2019s why MMM\u2019s flexible pay structure has worked so well - PT contributors are paid on an hourly basis. Instead of having them work a set number of hours/week, they work as needed on a project basis, saving the DAO tens of thousands of dollars per season. In exchange, we pay above-market rates and contributors get to be part of a dynamic, vibrant community of freelancers working toward a shared goal.  2) Operations management As an added benefit to our structure, I spend minimal time syncing and working 1-1 with a large chunk of the team. @birdsoar leads the design team (a team of 5 part-timers), acting autonomously to serve the DAO, with a 1x every 2 week check-in between myself and LH. The same goes with @MathildaDV and the content team - as a WS lead, I don\u2019t interface with the our writers/content producers unless it is a major project with major deliverables (and even then, I deeply trust these people to manage our projects well). All in all, I spend maybe a few hours a week syncing with individuals on their work. Any other time spent managing is done in ClickUp where we all stay organized and I can track projects as they go, with quick DMs to get updates when needed. Most of my time can be spent on high-value projects.  I have little left to say - @alexalombardo has very aptly pointed out the flaws in trying to pinch pennies on a marketing budget vs. looking at the wider DAO and our lack of clear objectives. @Viriya has eloquently outlined the key role MMM has been playing (and will continue to play) in delivering key outputs and as a strategic hub at the DAO (which CSDO last season had acknowledged is the weakest point of our DAO-OS). I think that going down the path of saying no to this budget is a terrible idea and will have major consequences for our organization. Instead, I propose we pass this budget and focus on really nailing down organizational goals, north star metrics and a cohesive DAO roadmap. ",

Highlighting the key priorities for the season is enormously helpful and I agree with many above that I\u2019d like to see that continued season over season WRT overall MMM goals that support a longer term vision of the brand and product. I think those benchmarks will be important to communicate to the wider community the long term impact investment in brand can have. Some thoughts on past success that I\u2019d like to comment on that @coachjonathan you call out as well:  Twitter engagement rate growth from 2.5% to 4% is huge and should be celebrated as one of the best indicators of successful brand development and engagement. Email open rate of 16% is also relatively unheard of for most brands, with this kind of engagement it\u2019s a channel that could be leaned into even more. In future seasons segmentation can play a huge role in that strategy to ensure an even more successful open rate and then subsequent click through rate.  I\u2019m excited to follow the pilot with YAP global. I think results in the form of brand feature pieces can have enormous long term value and for $5k a campaign, that is a reasonable cost. In future budgets I hope to see a breakdown of category i.e. spend on PR, spend on events, spend on freelances, spend on swag, etc vs. just headcount. But I do appreciate the breakdown by campaign and think that is a helpful start. The visual is also a good start, but I think could be made clearer in future iterations and visuals applied to future budget reviews and discussions. I would love to see visuals applied to calendars that outline campaigns over the course of S17 so that the community can understand all of the overlapping and interconnected initiatives occurring at any given time. Looking forward to being more involved with this work stream go forward and thanks for the enormous effort with this. ",

S17 Budget is almost $10k lower than Season 16 FDD is not requesting any reserves as this is the last season for us as a workstream The Contributor Transition process has already started partially with an intention for clear transfer roles after EthDenver Embedding fraud & data analyst/science knowledge and expertise across the workstreams will help the DAO realize the value of trust & risk management as well as increase awareness for fast-paced, data-driven \u201cbuild-measure-learn\u201d culture Open Data Community continues data infrastructure innovation with hackathons and provides data transparency, provenance, and reproducibility for algorithmic policy decisions  3 key themes this season:    Continued Trust in Gitcoin\u2019s Ability to Prevent Fraud    Empowering the DAO with Open Data Infrastructure & Processes    FDD Workstream Dissolution Success     Amount FDD is requesting $123,694 from the treasury to complete a budget of $340,314 for S17. A breakdown of the budget can be found at the end of this document.     Gitcoin Season Season 15 Season 16 Season 17     Season Budget $349,500 $349,500 $340,314   Season Reserves $233,000 $172,615 $216,620 1*   Unspent Reserves % 100% 100% 100%   Treasury Request USD $362,500 $409,885  $123,694 2**    1*) FDD received $233,000 in reserves which were requested at a GTC price of $1.65 in S15. These were received in January at a GTC price of $1.37 making the received total of $193,461. 60% was converted to stables ($116,077) leaving a 40% exposure of GTC to upward price movement from $1.37 to $1.78 ($77,384 to $100,543) leaving a total of $216,620 in unspent reserves 2**) Since FDD intends to dissolve as a workstream, we will request the full season budget less 100% rolled over reserves from S16. The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.   Milestone Report S16 Season 16 has been a very dynamic and the most unusual season for us. We set out with likely projects (S16 budget request) and needed to respond to the changing circumstances of the DAO during the season. The changes include the decision not to host GR16 in December, to deprecate the cGrants product, the decision by GPC/PGF that sybil defense services wouldn\u2019t be needed during UNICEF/Fantom/Alpha rounds, and subsequent findings that these did indeed need services. Our assessment on what we completed and why can be found here: Miro | Online Whiteboard for Visual Collaboration     Objectives Past Season Initiative / Outcome Key Result     Continuous analysis & validation of passport scores made available for round owners & technical users in partnership with the Passport team.   Everything the Passport team asked for was delivered on time and extra work was done  * Created 4 scores including the one in use for Alpha rounds and Passport Scoring as a Service * Built a passport scoring application mvp* Delivered stamp topology research and stamp prioritization requests   Build reliable composable, open source software tools for round owners to prevent fraud.   Documentation and understanding were massively improved, but actual building was slower than expected. Results of hackathon could make this green.  * Designed a user interface for legos to be used by an fdd fraud consultant & eventually a round owner* 5 Packages wallet legos in FDD github* Created documentation for the person of a fraud consultant or round operator* Created & updated readme files for all legos and applications and general getting started* Created FAQ for Open Data Community to build and interact with legos* Posted 3 articles discussing Sybil Scoring Legos* Building custom aura implementation for gitcoin grants and an gitcoin/fdd team to participate   To empower a regen data community with infrastructure, tools, and shared learnings which provides 50% of impactful insights into optimal capital allocation using Gitcoin grants.   Community growth and participation were a huge success with non-gitcoin community members driving many efforts.  * Enabled the community led curation of data sources for quality and usefulness.* Collaboratively authored the landscape of useful tools and guides for Open Data Community.* Catalyzed & lead creation of a platform to host the open data community including collaboration about tools, data sources and methodologies especially non-gitcoin participation documentation & bounties to create new analysis and turn validated analysis into legos* Over 100 in Discord with 6 active (non-fdd)  contributors on Github* Built a public facing data & research hub with all past grant round datasets with FDD   Find a sustainable strategy to engage ODC members and contributors to service decentralized grants rounds & maintain quality processes.   While we lowered the % of ODC costs which Gitcoin pays, we did not establish governance to run a grants round yet. This is partly because the protocol wasn\u2019t ready this season.  * Doubled prize total from $19k to $40k while Gitcoin/FDD is only paying 39% of it! (paid 100% last round)* Added 6 sponsor orgs* Contests hosted for unicef, fantom, and gitcoin alpha* One previous hackathon participant was funded and returned as a Sponsor to the 2nd hackathon - They also provided services to the Fantom round outside of the hackathon.   Continuously iterate, test & innovate on algorithmic solution quality and availability.   We deprioritized much of the grant eligibility work due to the decision to have closed alpha rounds, but had multiple useful outputs from FDD research.  * Bankless & Snapshot Analysis leading to 6 new legos* Created a topology of stamps with recommendations* Designed Cost of Forgery stamp weighting model* Trial use of rhaphorty open source graphdb for graph analysis* Building custom aura implementation for gitcoin grants and an gitcoin/fdd team to participate* cadCAD round simulator - can be used to find optimality gap analysis and optimal red team strategies* Design workflow pipelines for legos from ideation or behavioral observation through building   The right work gets done and the tools and access needed to do it is in order. We build plans for the future   The lego process was more difficult to scope and start but now since it is going it is moving well, we worked through many models for the future, but ended up needing the last week of the season to realize dissolution was the best answer.  * Created a custom moloch DAO (on testnet) for a multisig allowing for true decentralization and potential spin out capability while separating Gitcoin funds to NOT be accessible by a ragequit* Analyzed at all past FDD contributors pay, membership status, and contribution weeks to design a share splitting model* Received a grant for sybil study of Aave onchain activity which overlaps with needs for Gitcoin* Posted 5 FDD review articles* Taught and/or transferred responsibility to Tigress treasury management and how to pay contributors    Legend  Success  Incomplete, will hit goal or priority change  Incomplete, will not hit goal  Canceled - out of workstream\u2019s control   Moving to a Protocol Future The launch of the Allo Protocol will shift the needs of the Gitcoin community away from the historic goals of the Fraud Detection and Defense workstream.  In pivoting into a new structure, FDD is preparing to support the break out into smaller and more end-to-end accountable workstreams, without sacrificing the unified intention of the FDD: fraud defense, risk mitigation, and trust building.  These smaller functional units eliminate any \u201cI have 2 bosses\u201d conflicts of interest. Individuals safe-guarding risk and trust priorities are embedded in end-to-end accountable working groups. The core promise of the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream has been providing legitimacy & trust to the outcomes of Gitcoin\u2019s quadratic funding rounds. This has been done by keeping quadratic funding rounds free from stolen and misallocated funds caused by sybil attacks and illegitimate grants. The continued improvement of our ability for clients using Passport & Allo protocols the ability to access and share this trust with their communities belongs as a function that is accountable with the program, product or engineering teams providing the trust. These functions of the current \u201ccentralized\u201d organizational FDD structure will have moved over to other end-to-end accountable workstreams by the course of Season 17 to better reflect the future structure desired by stewards & Gitcoin leadership. We anticipate beginning to make these operational changes gradually with clear accountability shifts only happening after EthDenver, concurrently with the GPC workstream splitting into Passport & Allo streams. These changes are being made with the prior consent and partnership of the other workstreams involved. This last season FDD has 3 key themes:  Continued Trust in Gitcoin\u2019s Ability to Prevent Fraud: Data informed recommendations to mitigate fraud are made continuously available.

Footnotes in Conclusion and Looking Forward With the DAO Data-related outcomes described above, we intend to provide data insights for protocol-based and transparent DAO operations. We have the skills and the opportunity to codify certain best practices. We also believe past learnings from best-in-class sybil defense have led to several key opportunities for automation, tooling, and experimentation.  As we prepare to better utilize data for FDD aims, we see a necessity of building out the data capacities of the whole DAO alongside us, and it no longer seems efficient for FDD\u2019s data resources to operate in silo.  Can Gitcoin be the new, more secure, and more trusted GoFundMe?  Can we correct the issues inherent in early web2 projects like Kickstarter & co?  We believe so.  But to be ready for the new challenges which come from a wider audience, we have to invest in tooling and the necessary infrastructure now in order to carry out the promise inherent in an on-chain, trustless grants system. It is, of course, the case that Gitcoin is not alone in these essential needs to secure our protocol and protect our governance practices.  We have heard repeatedly from our partners \u2013 new and long-standing \u2013 that it is necessary for other DAOs in the ecosystem to have the tools and the knowledge available to protect their own environments. Because of the growing demand for such services, it is thought to be well-validated that the DAOs Growth unit can spinout and begin seeking payment for more generalized \u201ctrust-as-a-service\u201d as an a la carte consulting product, as well as providing this service which can be added to the most vulnerable grants rounds ad hoc.

                    "content": "First off, let me say that I deeply admire this team\u2019s intention to work itself out of a job this season and to distribute itself across the DAO and the broader ecosystem. This is admirable and a clear sign of true mission-alignment. Second, given the intention to dissolve, I am highly supportive of a transition season that not only enables the services provided by FDD to be refactored / relocated but also gives the people reasonable time to find their footing elsewhere in the DAO or the broader ecosystem. For these reasons, I am supportive at a high level of both the proposed outcomes and the amount of budget requested by FDD for S17. That said, I have some more specific feedback that I would like to see incorporated in the final request, which I will share below.  1. The three themes read as goals for FDD contributors, not the DAO. The current themes are:  Contributor Transition Success Dissolution Governance Success ODC Project Value to Gitcoin  I would prefer to see a clear statement of where the DAO should head and how this team will contribute to getting it there. For instance, this is a great first theme to anchor on:     tigress:  building out the data capacities of the whole DAO   Another theme, not explicitly mentioned, might be: \u201censure Sybil attacks do not detract from the QF experience for round managers and grants\u201d A third theme could be \u201cbootstrap a community outside Gitcoin to contribute to Sybil defense on the protocol\u201d.  2. The outcomes feel arbitrary and inward-looking This may sound overly harsh, so let me provide some examples:  5 or more legos discovered or built during the 2nd ODC hackathon are used during the beta round fraud analysis  If I\u2019m a round manager, I don\u2019t care how many legos it takes or where they came from. I care about Sybil attacks manipulating my matching pool. I care about projects feeling unhappy about the allocation. I care about honest users complaining on Twitter that they couldn\u2019t donate or their votes were squelched. (aside: I believe there is a HUGE role for data analysis and new legos / algorithms to play in improving the round manager experience, but those are the means to an end, not the ends.) Similarly, all of the Contribution Transition Success outcomes in the form \u201ctransitioning [\u2026] from FDD to [\u2026] team\u201d do not feel demand-driven. Again, I strongly believe there are highly valuable skills among FDD members that should be absorbed elsewhere in the DAO! But a successful outcome should be framed from the perspective of the DAO and its partners accomplishing something, not a contributor finding a new home.  3. ODC activities / outcomes don\u2019t make sense here As per my earlier point, I am very supportive of a theme along the lines of \u201cbootstrap a community outside Gitcoin to contribute to Sybil defense on the protocol\u201d. I am also supportive of budget going to outsource or bounty work through ODC. But it feels disorienting to have a DAO goal be, in effect, to prove that another DAO is valuable to Gitcoin.   tl;dr I am supportive of the overall budget. I share the goal of ending this season with every current member of FDD finding a new home within a Gitcoin workstream, in ODC, or in some other entity that is highly complimentary to Gitcoin. But I would like to see some crisp, more measurable outcomes to this transition season that are framed from the DAO\u2019s perspective. ",

But a successful outcome should be framed from the perspective of the DAO and its partners accomplishing something, not a contributor finding a new home.   It would be very helpful to know what a successful transition looks like, what the timeline for transition looks like, and what would a successful end state look like. Regarding the proposal for a data workstream:     tigress:  A proposal for a \u201cthin\u201d project based DAO data workstream is ready for Season 18 budget reviews.   I\u2019m not supportive of this line item and feel it\u2019s heading in the wrong direction. This is a purely functional workstream vs. an end-to-end accountable workstream. I would prefer to see budgeted work embedded in the workstreams, but encourage non-budgeted organizational structures that span workstreams (i.e. guilds, or communities of practice).  Given our budgets don\u2019t come with a BATNA, I would want to quickly explore that here: Given the FDD has reserves for 2/3 of the next season, this budget is really just a request for the final 1/3 of the season. If this budget wasn\u2019t passed, what would happen? For Contributor Transition, given the current needs in the DAO for the analysis work to happen across Growth/Allo/Passport I think any workstream that is planning to absorb FDD\u2019ers could support the contributors joining in S18 out of reserves. I see little impact if 2 mo or 3 mo of budget is available to support this transition. For ODC I\u2019m unclear what 2 mo vs 3 mo of further incubation in the DAO would yield. For the Dissolution Governance requests I\u2019m unclear what would not be delivered in 2 mo vs 3 mo. To help Stewards make this choice. I think it would be helpful to clarify what the choice is between (2 mo vs 3 mo) and what would change in the S17 FDD output given either of those outcomes. ",

Top of mind for the longer term projects in flight:  Best in class on-chain analysis tools so that Gitcoin can not only provide elegant protections against sybils, but also serve our greater needs of grantee transparency and reputation-assessment long-term. Dashboards, core metric design + results of user research from our alpha partners: How do they want to do sybil defense? What are they willing (and unwilling) to do internally- and where does sybil defense rank in their priorities?  Both of these are currently underway - and can be accelerated if we accept certain trade-offs - but given that there are lead-time contingencies which are outside of FDD control (e.g. the time to sync an archival node is ~3 weeks) - let\u2019s be really clear about the time commitments we need to do an excellent job - and also honest about when analyst + data eng attention can fully be focused on the new initiatives of the workstreams they\u2019re absorbed into.  I think we should articulate where we are now and what key milestones will have been achieved throughout the season. (renewing my lucidchart trial now ) ",

I will try to break it down here.  Fund the budget  Finish ongoing work which is needed to successfully set the infrastructure which will support the analysts that move into the other workstreams. The people in FDD have the time to transition whether they are continuing in another workstream or moving on. We collectively celebrate a governance success as FDD completes work and smoothly transitions. Will cost the DAO $125k   Don\u2019t fund the budget  Confused contributors unsure about their transition will make finishing work unlikely or difficult to predict. Some would likely qualify for a severence and would need to end their work immediately for us to fund it. Loss of trust of contributors in other workstreams to see that Gitcoin has their best interest in mind. Unknown losses in knowledge transfer to newer FDD members. Will save the DAO $125k  Going into the Unicef, Fantom, and Alpha rounds we were told they would not need fraud analysis for these rounds. We were prepared anyway and have been working directly with Fantom to make sure they have all the knowledge to make choices that build trust with their community. This work required FDD contributor experience and skills to gather the data. This data gathering process even helped us to troubleshoot protocol issues with GPC as we learned how the protocol was setup. We found issues such as the need for timestamps with contributions. These weren\u2019t originally on the subgraph, but they are necessary for fraud analysis. We had the ability to scrape the ceramic nodes when product was way to busy fixing issues. We did this to better understand Passport effectiveness. We are currently doing data operations work for the Alpha round and the analysis will follow. This data operations/engineering example is only one that illustrates this issue. At this time, FDD works as a team with specialist strengths boosting the abilities of the others. To successfully transition, we need to move from this working culture to one where more generalist capable analysts are embedded in the workstreams. We are lucky that much of FDD\u2019s past work is at a point where we can finish building systems that will 10x the output & accuracy of the analysts who continue the fraud detection & defense work for Gitcoin. Without clear transitions for the contributors, it is unclear which necessary skills we might lose.  A look at context and dependencies We have some work that is ongoing which has context and dependencies which I don\u2019t think would be easy to manage through an abrupt transfer. This 30-60-90 milestone diagram shows a few of the deliverables listed above which have high context & dependencies. This work is the most likely work to be disrupted. It is also the work that will best set up the DAO for a data informed future with the analysts in each workstream empowered by having the right tools and processes.  Image 2023-02-10 at 10.35.30 AM2304\u00d71574 155 KB   My personal opinion & bias As an FDD workstream lead, you can see there is obvious bias likely to be present in my opinion. However, if you consider that I am the one putting forth the idea to dissolve FDD for the better of the DAO, then perhaps my motivation is pure. Especially when you consider that I am one of the FDD contributors without a clear transition. There are currently 3/9 who have fairly certain transition plans, and 5/9 who I believe have clear and obvious paths forward. I personally want to see Gitcoin succeed. I am a stakeholder not only as a contributor, steward, and user, but also with substantial personal \u201cskin in the game\u201d. My honest advice to the stewards would be to approve this budget. FDD has protected the community from $3 million in fraudulent allocation of funds over the last year and a half. This move to dissolve FDD is not because fraud detection & defense is no longer needed. It\u2019s exactly the opposite. We have the opportunity to setup the infrastructure, processes, and tools needed to empower the analysts working with the end to end accountable workstreams. This effort might not happen if this transition is not managed well. To me this is not a question of 2 or 3 months of work. It is 3 months of work with smooth transitions for both those staying with Gitcoin and those moving on OR confusion and difficulty rallying the team to do their best and complete the work that sets up  future protocol and program success. The work we do this season IS part of Gitcoin\u2019s most important work. I encourage stewards to provide us the opportunity to show the entire web 3 ecosystem that  Gitcoin governance is working The next 100 grants program managers can be absolutely sure that using Gitcoin gives them trust, legitimacy, and credible neutrality in funding what matters.

We really foresee enterprise-level data abilities to be a huge need for multiple initiatives around the DAO - certainly going well outside of fraud-fighting and systems design for risk mitigation, as you call-out.   How would on-chain analytics help other work streams? Any potential synergy between this part of FDD and Gitcoin passport (has web2 credentials)?   Yes to synergy, to be sure! Passport use and roll-out by our partners definitely presents a rich opportunity to see the success (and the failure) of various stamps in safeguarding many communities with diverse needs. We have already been asked for recommendations from early partners in this capacity, and we see the work FDD has done in creating scores and training models to be something where there will be an ongoing need. An example of this is the good initial results in predictive nature of a model that maps stamp-attainment to average donor spend. Outside of the Passport product team, we also see several mission-critical initiatives to be reliant on on-chain data and a final-state permissionless postgres solution. Examples of this include one of the top things we heard from donors during alpha rounds: They want to see their own donation history.  Another example where data infra is pivotal to our success would be in providing indicators of Grantee reputation and tracing grant-awarded funds over time. We are building in a way which will make this kind of data not only available internally, but available for public audit at any time.   Once certain on-chain analytics tool is employed (assuming quite some work and follow-ups and maintenance are needed), who/which party would be held responsible to generate insights and crystallize into action items if FDD members are spread out across work streams?   I think I addressed this a bit above in terms of ownership of future insights, and how these initiatives may live within product teams as needed. As far as the ongoing maintenance need - on-chain data will actually be by far our lowest-lift on an ongoing basis, and node maintenance the smallest fee (less than 20 USD/monthly currently scoped).  Through the peer-to-peer sharing method pioneered by the OpenSource indexing project TrueBlocks, our on-chain data will only improve with more users. More generally, we do see the full-time Data Engineer (@zengatsu) serving a role which will be billed similarly to how DevOps has been billed of throughout the DAO: each workstream who depends on such services absorbs part of the salary and SAAS costs.   A follow up question would be are there going to be occasionally check-ins as a team to align on the shared topic? How would this look different to the working style prior to dissolution?   Excellent question and I think we\u2019re all curious how this is going to shape up in practice   We welcome any ideas or best practices in terms of \u201cguilds\u201d and similar formations where we might have formal specialties imbedded in product teams\u2026 ",

                    "content": "Yes, and over the course of the last year and a half, FDD has made good treasury decisions. We accurately report our seasonal reserves to roll over and request the difference. This request is to fund our S17 budget of $340k. In the past we have used these \u201cgray funds\u201d sparingly. For example, last season we had great breakthroughs with time-series graph database analysis with a payment to Pometry for setup and example uses of their open source Raphorty DB. This was not on our original budget. The gray funds have been a way for us to maintain some autonomy in getting things done when needed. At the end of this season, we will wind down the workstream entirely. We believe we should have autonomy in using those funds. They will first pay for severence for those who are put out of work by the dissolution and secondly be put to use further advancing our sybil defense capabilities. We want to push innovation forward, not just for our mandate, but for the DAO which desperately needs some innovative governance experiments which aren\u2019t choked off by top delegated stewards not having the bandwidth to decide how to manage them. Because we believe these funds are separate from the quarterly budget request, we believe we have the autonomy to choose how they are spent. Our current plan is to setup a Quadratic Vote for stewards to decide how much is allocated to 1) sending back to treasury  2) conduct a jokedao contest for sybil innovations  3) grant to Open Data Community as Founding Member to a subDAO structure   4) Fund FDD as a MolochDAO for ongoing independent services. Maybe there are other options. We would then follow through the execution of the results. This would happen after EthDenver and before 4/28, the end of Season 17. Here are a few other reasons why we think ensuring FDD gets this budget is both a legitimate and smart decision.   The treasury decisions weren\u2019t primarily gains in the last quarter.   Saying no after the vote is shady. We did not hide our current holdings this season as we dissolve. We reported accurately and consistently as we always have.   The secondary effect of taking workstreams autonomy to do as they will with funds they acquire will demotivate them from being creative in becoming sustainable. Why would a workstream do any treasury management? Why would they attempt to get outside grants?   CSDO discussed sending funds back to the treasury. However, that is CSDO which is an opt in council representing how workstreams will work together. All of the workstreams have opted out of CSDO recommendations in the past, so why is FDD opting out of this one different.  The entire point of CSDO is that it IS NOT governance sanctioned by token holders. It should only make OPT-IN decisions that require the decisions about workstream collaboration to not be enforceable. This means the decisions have to be good enough to opt in. Saying that a CSDO decision has the same value as a token vote would upend the entire structure of CSDO, its purpose, and its intended outcomes. It would also directly violate the foundation agreement for token governance as the decision making power. Of course workstreams can make decisions within their workstream or between workstreams if it doesn\u2019t break any steward voted policies or require their releasing funds. CSDO is bottom\u2019s up, soft power.    Conclusion It seems like there are 2 choices:   Follow through with the vote. Maintain integrity and consistency. FDD finishes the season working hard and gets the rest of the DAO inspired with some governance innovation and the gray funds going to continuing our mission.   Cancel or overturn the vote. Lose integrity. FDD members not moving forward likely have to stop working on 4/1 (or earlier) so we can pay severance. FDD is able to return a minimal amount of what\u2019s left < $20k. No extra governance innovation. No funds being jointly allocated by stewards and FDD for continued sybil innovation after dissolution.   ",

You have 100k more then you outlined you need to complete your stated work\u2026 why do you need another $123k on top of that?

                    "content": "Here\u2019s what I think is going on (hopefully Joe can clarify further): Through smart treasury management and other means independent of the work of Gitcoin, the FDD workstream was able to amass some funds extra to that given to them by the GitcoinDAO. I believe Joe is arguing that these \u201cgray funds\u201d should be used at the discretion of the FDD Workstream, and should not be included as pertinent information in FDD\u2019s budget request from GitcoinDAO. Whether or not one agrees with Joe on this is a function of how they view the workstream-DAO relationship (which is currently ill-defined, and is something we should try to define better in the future to prevent problems like these). For example, if the \u201cWorkstream\u201d is an autonomous unit that GitcoinDAO grants money in exchange for some future work, then Joe\u2019s point is valid. We should not expect the \u201cWorkstream\u201d to do work on behalf of GitcoinDAO with funds that were not given by GitcoinDAO. In the context of this budget, under this assumption of a \u201cWorkstream,\u201d then FDD should receive DAO funds because they are doing DAO work. If they do not receive DAO Funds, then we should only expect from them work that can be compensated by the DAO Funds they have in reserve (NOT their \u201cgray funds\u201d). However, if the \u201cWorkstream\u201d is bound to GitcoinDAO in the way a corporate division is bound to the larger corporation, then Joe\u2019s point is invalid. All funds made by a corporate division belongs to the corporation itself, and is relevant to all funding decisions of that corporation. To be honest, I don\u2019t think anyone in GitcoinDAO thinks of a workstream like this. Another possibility (and perhaps the most likely) is that the \u201cWorkstream\u201d is somewhere in-between, without a clear precedent. However, even if we do not explicitly state it, we are defining this precedent by choosing to revote or not. Another important precedent we are setting is that of revotes. What constitutes a revote and what doesn\u2019t? There do not seem to be clear guidelines for this, which is unfortunate considering that our voting process is largely social (no automatic execution on snapshot, and automatic execution on-chain has to be pushed through by large delegates willing to pay the gas cost). TL;DR: We are setting two important precedents through the decision to revote and not fund FDD\u2019s treasury request:  What is the Workstream-GitcoinDAO relationship and expectation? What constitutes grounds for a revote?  All stewards should carefully think about their answer to these questions before making a decision. ",

I am doing this because I believe there is an insecure gap in our governance. We need to be in challenging governance situations to learn if there is a delta between how secure we think we are, and what the onchain portion of the governance plays out. There is soft power that can say \u201cI believe we should revote\u201d. I\u2019m saying \u201cshow me how governance actually enforces whatever it decides here\u201d AND \u201cwhichever way this goes, let\u2019s see if the DAO governance we have today leads us to a smart decision for tomorrow.\u201d I do believe my claim is legitimate. Others don\u2019t. Ok Governance, what happens next. Do people with soft power get to say we must revote. How does our governance today decide this in a fair way? I led the grants reviews for 5 or 6 seasons. These are the type of questions that come up in grant disputes and appeals. Our next 100 ALLO program managers will need to help their communities solve this problem.  Not the specific law, but how does governance handle the process.  Let\u2019s look up the current state of our agreements. 2. Let\u2019s have a thoughtful, careful debate on how and why this decision should go each way Let\u2019s make sure we get a great outcome (like we did with the Akita Balancer pool - A governance mega-win that was super inspirational) Share the learnings of our practical governance problems in how WE allocate funds across our DAO and the ecosystem to help them fund what matters.  All I\u2019m asking is how do we find a legitimate outcome? I do believe that my understanding is both legitimate, and the better decision for the DAO long term. Either way it turns out the funds will be spent in a way that pushes forward the DAO goals. My word and reputation is behind that. This isn\u2019t that large of a sum. This low stakes way of testing governance seems like a good idea for us to learn our weaknesses. Worst case scenario, I wasted some time pushing the subject. Best case scenario, we truly learn if we have weaknesses in our current system and if we can learn from our experience about how to solve a problem that EVERY grant round has! ",

                    "content": "Just catching up on things here, but want to share several reactions. As a steward, I am primarily focused on the question: \u201cis this budget proposal a good use of DAO resources\u201d. I have not been concerned with the question \u201cwhere will the funding coming from\u201d. To me, that feels like more of an implementation detail. It was my impression (perhaps incorrectly) that funding could be moved around across different multisigs if it needed to be. Coming to @chaselb\u2019s two questions:     chaselb:   What is the Workstream-GitcoinDAO relationship and expectation? What constitutes grounds for a revote?    1. What is the Workstream-GitcoinDAO relationship and expectation? I have viewed each workstream as a pod within the DAO that\u2019s granted a multisig and the autonomy to figure out how best to get things done. I have not viewed workstreams as service providers to the DAO. Personally, I don\u2019t like the idea of each workstream having its own P&L or the ability to accumulate a surplus that is then controlled by \u2026 who? the workstream lead? current contributors? This could also create an incentive for workstreams to overestimate what they request from the treasury so they can build up their own reserves. That does not feel like something we should be messing with at a time when neither the DAO nor any of its workstreams has a revenue model. Others may feel differently about this issue and I respect that. 2. What constitutes grounds for a revote? We should revote if we feel we were not given an accurate picture of what\u2019s at stake in the original proposal. Proposal-generation and Snapshot voting are social coordination mechanisms. I don\u2019t see a reason to be rigid on this issue, but if revotes start happening regularly, it will definitely erode confidence in the DAO. Judging from the comments here, a number of people appear in favor of a revote. Personally, I\u2019m in favor of a revote because the $123K treasury request was presented as a requirement to meet the S17 budget of $340K. Had I known that the workstream already had $445K and was therefore projected to dissolve in three months with a net balance $228K [$445 + $123 - $340], then I would have voted differently.  Finally, let\u2019s not conflate the issues. It\u2019s important to articulate the intended financial relationship between workstreams and the DAO. It\u2019s also important to determine if / when a revote is on the table. To Shawn\u2019s question:     shawn16400:  What happens when a proposal has legitimately passed, but new information surfaces and voters no longer feel the information was symmetric?   We revote. Regardless of the explanation for why the information was presented a certain way the first time. And we vow to do better so it hopefully doesn\u2019t happen again. ",

                    "content": " Let\u2019s Revote First, I am seeing broader sentiment that requests the revote. I\u2019m quite disappointed that there isn\u2019t more enthusiasm around finding a legitimate way to determine if a revote will happen. We have an opportunity to find a more legitimate solution - a solution EVERY ALLO PROGRAM MANGER NEEDS. We could direct power for revote to the steward council. For example, a Snapshot vote with the following options:  Revote Have steward council decide if a revote should happen and set precedent for how revotes are made legitimate Keep the results of the first vote  I believe that either 1 or 2 would end up with the same results for this budget, however, 2 would be the better decision for the DAO.  Clarifications  Regarding my Intent to deceive     kyle:  Hey @DisruptionJoe - I wanted to confirm this is the amount in total FDD needs to operate for this season? I see that based on currently market values, FDD has two gnosis safes: 1 - Gitcoin Fraud Detection & Defense (Main) starting with (0xD45) and has a balance of 361.72K USD 2 - Fraud Detection & Defense (ops)  starting with (0xbc4) and has 83.16K USD   This felt misleading to me. I had a specific one on one session with @kyle in December where we discussed that FDD has these funds AND that we were applying for an Aave grant. I suggested we should think about the Governance issues that would come up when we dissolved FDD. At the time, we both thought it wouldn\u2019t happen this soon, but it was explicitly discussed. Additionally, I did bring this up at a recent Stewards call and a Steward Council call. Yes, I didn\u2019t put this as material info on the budget request, however, no other workstream puts that info on their budgets nor is there an established norm across most DAOs. In fact, the norm is that everyone knows the info is public and proposers never put up how much they are currently holding.     J9leger:  No other workstream has gray funds and this is something we\u2019ve never heard about before. Could we have full transparency about these gray funds?   Is this implying that I have been lying by omission? I don\u2019t know why you don\u2019t know about them. I have spoken about them at both CSDO and steward meetings in the past. Not only have I brought it up, I\u2019ve called it out as a potential issue and that we should be prepared.     ccerv1:  Personally, I\u2019m in favor of a revote because the $123K treasury request was presented as a requirement to meet the S17 budget of $340K.   As I understand, the budget request was only presented as a request for the DAO to fully fund our Season 17. If one believes that the DAO should control how the $228k in gray funds (That wouldn\u2019t have existed) are spent, then it is reasonable for them to think we should have reported them. If you believe those funds should be autonomously spent by the workstream (In line with the workstream\u2019s mandate), then you might not consider it as relevant to a seasonal budget request. Whichever of these opinions are right is up to the DAO. Hopefully, this helps clarify that this wasn\u2019t a deceitful thing to do on our part. I\u2019m also quite surprised you didn\u2019t have previous knowledge that FDD had these funds. We do speak pretty freely about them in FDD and always have!  Legitimacy of workstream autonomy In August 2021, I put up the first FDD proposal. It involved personal risk as I left the company and had little clarity on what the future would hold. The message from Gitcoin to the public at the launch of the DAO was that workstreams would be autonomous (DAO of DAOs). I was even told that it was 100% up to me if we incorporated, but they recommended we did. We pushed back, hired legal help, and defined FDD as an unincorporated non-profit association and designed contributor agreements. We\u2019ve discussed workstream treasury management many times with the CSDO group. It was necessary! I remember @annika asking what she would do if the price of GTC dropped and PGF couldn\u2019t follow through on dollar based commitments to pay contributors. WE WERE EXPECTED TO DO OUR OWN TREASURY MANAGEMENT! Some of our workstreams had leadership that was hired by Gitcoin Holdings and paid to create proposals and create a workstream. GPC was transferred from the company to the DAO less than a year ago. I understand that many people would view our workstreams as departments in a corporation. I\u2019m not here to say that they are wrong. I am here to say that it shouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to consider my viewpoint legitimate considering the early risk I took and the experience I had. If it is a legitimate viewpoint, then our governance should have a process to solve the issue in which those with both viewpoints would consider legitimate - even if the result isn\u2019t in their favor.  Suggestion for next steps I could post the vote suggested at the top. This might be more legitimate than someone else posting it, but I don\u2019t feel too strongly about that detail. Mostly, I\u2019d like every Gitcoin Stakeholder to know that we were proud to bring extra value to the DAO. This seems like a great decision to have to make! If we moved forward without a revote, we were excited to do governance experimentation dogfooding the protocol and/or testing other allocation mechanisms to spend the last of the funds we would have had. Specifically, ideas like a QV round, a JokeRace, or Moloch implementations where the DAO would have ragequit capabilities if it didn\u2019t like the decisions made. It could help fund things like:  Decartography PoC - Using DeSoc collusion dampening BrightID Aura Implementation Open Data Community Sandbox Sponsorship - Another node pinning relevant data from trueblocks Sybil detection legos built using our findings from this last season with Pometry and their Raphorty open source time-series graph database. And many other great ideas!  Rather than push for this vote to go the way I think it should, I\u2019m pushing for it to be handled in the best way possible for the future of the DAO, even if it is against my personal opinion. I\u2019d love to see people establish the steward council as having the power to call for a revote, followed by voting their fully informed present opinion on the topic. Perhaps, we could compromise by writing a new GCP for us to do the planned innovation experiments if the DAO were to give us the explicit approval? ",

I deeply appreciate the work of  @kyle @J9leger @DisruptionJoe @connor @kevin.olsen @griff and others\u2026 without them Gitcoin would not be what be what it is today and I have so say I can\u2019t wait to see what it evolves into   I would like to share my honest thought around the \u201cissue\u201d discussed in the last 20 or so comments and hope that by this I can provide additional clarity for those who seek it.  At first sight this appears to be a complicated subject because the more far away a Steward/Key decision maker is from the actual \u201caction zone\u201d the more inclined it would be to believe that Joe has omitted the existence of the \u201cgray funds\u201d , but this is a false premise because: -as a formed team lead in the FDD I have always been informed of the existence of these funds, also every FDD member was aware of the existence of these funds, more so at certain points we were included and informed in all the decision making around them -I have been in numerous public meetings(with other WS) in which Joe has proudly talked about them and the way that FDD managed to be very wise via good treasury management decision making -if he didn\u2019t care about the DAO and Gitcoin\u2019s mission so much he wouldn\u2019t have made the effort to protect funds via wise treasury management I respect that a lot of the Stewards have a limited amount of time(because they are doing valuable  work for all of web3) and it\u2019s hard for them to understand what\u2019s actually going on. The past two years have been filled with experimentation for the common-good, decentralization at almost every decision making level and also empowerment with the goal of growing the Gitcoin DAO. As the bull market ended, the macro has changed and it resulted in a relatively accelerated shift toward a more sustainable future for the DAO, it\u2019s is understandable, because ofc the biggest vulnerability a DAO  is\u2026surprize\u2026\u201chuman nature\u201d  , but this should not create dissonance between all the great people working towards our collective PG future. IMO the concrete fair way forward would be to continue to fund the FDD as indented because the information was not hidden and people voted yes to the budget, but unfortunately seeing how the conversation here took place and what the current state of affairs is I am worried that this would lead to dissonance between stewards and this is not the point, so  +1 to @chaselb viewpoint:     chaselb:  do not believe these funds are material information, and I do not believe we should conduct a revote. I DO believe, in the absence of a formal process for deciding whether or not to revote, we should create some temporary mechanism for doing so (such as pushing it to the Steward Council), and then workshop a more thoughtful mechanism for deciding whether or not to revote.   As in life these challenges appear and can lead to an even stronger DAO, it will be very interesting to see how Gitcoin DAO handles this particular one as it seems to be quite complex and provoking at first  I also know for a fact that the last 2 years have not been easy for all the Gitcoin WS leads, more so for the ones that always pushed forward and maintained their position as Joe did. I also know for a fact that Joes intentions are always positive towards GitcoinDAO and its future.  He is one of the most value aligned persons I\u2019ve met in web3 and worked with in web3.  If someone doubts that he can just search DisruptionJoe in Gitcoins Discord and will be amazed by the level of engagement and value addition most of his messages lead 2. I really hope the situation is handled in the best way possible for all the parties involved, but I would add that a certain level of kudos should be awarded to the FDD leadership, who managed to be one of the WS who protected funds and generated profits via great treasury decision making.

Yes, that is 100% something that should be outlined and agreed-upon in the aftermath of all this, but I think having a huge debate & discussion around that just stifles progress in getting to an outcome here. To me it\u2019s directionally pretty clear that this is a re-vote situation, and then the re-vote specifics on guidelines/process can be figured out post-mortem. I also selfishly would love to see a TLDR recap of all this after the fact either in Steward Council or on a monthly steward call \u2013 what happened, what we learned, what we\u2019ll change in the future as a result.

Is it correct that:  The existence of the \u201csurplus\u201d FDD funds was made publicly known in a public and recorded Stewards council meeting. Many Stewards voted on FDD funding without doing due diligence and information-gathering, i.e. attending the meeting or reading the transcript. An unprecedented revote is being enacted on sentiment analysis of the basis of about ten forum posts, absent any provision in any existing GitCoin governance document.  If these are the facts, then my personal view is that a revote is completely illegitimate and sets a terrible precedent regarding the ability of individuals to simply assert decisions through personal will. It borders on the Tyranny of Structurelessness. Is there a clear model of the desired information flow in GitCoin governance, and of who bears what responsibility for that flow? Specifically, what are the official records that Stewards are expected to be familiar with before voting? Are Stewards expected to know what has occurred in meetings relevant to their votes? I understand that some Stewards have expressed that they have little bandwidth. But, I don\u2019t understand how this is possible: all human beings are equal in the fact that we all have 24 hours of bandwidth per day. I think ultimately that there need to be clear standards and expectations regarding what constitutes effective disclosure of relevant information, so that we can determine whether a standard of clear information availability has been met. Additionally, I\u2019m not sure if I have standing to raise points in this discussion, since I sold my all of my GitCoin this week.

The nature of the problem also allows us to take time without immediate financial worries for FDD. I\u2019d echo Octopus sentiment. Our governance says that a snapshot vote is final. If you look at Uniswap, 100% of their snapshot votes are enacted on Tally. Do we want to be the ones to change this precedent for the ecosystem based on a few posts on the forum rather than a legitimate process? How do we remain leaders in legitimacy after that? ",

With everyone I am in touch with regarding this situation, I try to draw a line between this example, and the proposed process to deal with this example.  I find doing that places a layer of abstraction between contention and good governance design.  This being the case, I moved responses to this to the proposal thread.     # [Gitcoin Community Proposal] - Post-vote appeal process (aka \u201cto reconsider\u201d a vote) \ud83e\udd16 DAO Governance and Vision       Picking comments up here from the FDD thread:    I agree there are two options here for this review, CSDO and the Steward Council and both have advantages and disadvantages.  Lets hit the highlights:  CSDO has greater history, it has better internal context, and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  However, it is not an elected body, it is comprised of Gitcoin insiders, and the CSDO charters states that its decision space includes \u201cDAO-wide governing agreements (except what\u2019s passe\u2026     ",

                    "content": "Just want to come back to this (after reading comments) and provide a bit more context regarding my position:   I have full confidence in Joe\u2019s integrity, that he has been acting in good faith, and that he is deeply committed to serving Gitcoin DAO and its community. I hope no one see this process as a referendum on one person\u2019s intentions.   I have deep respect for the work FDD has provided to the DAO over the years and the impact it has had on Sybil defense (both practically, by preventing attacks during rounds, and through its thought leadership / experimentation) and in the data community. I also hope no one sees this as a referendum on the value or legitimacy of FDD\u2019s work.   It is normal for organizations to refactor / reorg. Given the market conditions PLUS the fact that the DAO is transitioning from cGrants to a protocol stack, it makes sense to examine the role of \u201cservice\u201d workstreams like FDD and question whether the current structure is optimal. As a Steward looking in, my impression is that this could have been communicated / executed better. However, since learning of the plan to dissolve FDD after S17, my position has been to advocate for an orderly  and full season-long transition.       ccerv1:  First off, let me say that I deeply admire this team\u2019s intention to work itself out of a job this season and to distribute itself across the DAO and the broader ecosystem. This is admirable and a clear sign of true mission-alignment. Second, given the intention to dissolve, I am highly supportive of a transition season that not only enables the services provided by FDD to be refactored / relocated but also gives the people reasonable time to find their footing elsewhere in the DAO or the broader ecosystem.     I don\u2019t have a strong opinion (yet) on whether workstreams should have \u201cgray funds\u201d or what happens to those funds in the event of a workstream dissolving. It appears the DAO is divided on this issue. As Joe and others have said, this should be clarified and made more explicit. That work feels urgent. But I wouldn\u2019t make a decision and then try to apply it retroactively to FDD\u2019s case. From my perspective, FDD can do what it wants to with those funds \u2013 but they should be exhausted or at least fully earmarked by the end of S17.   I do believe the presence of those funds was material information to Stewards. Sure, the funds were not hidden, but the salient issue is that they were not mentioned as a source FDD could draw upon for completing its S17 budget. In effect, FDD had the choice of funding a full S17 by tapping its gray fund OR requesting an allocation from the treasury and preserving the gray fund so it could be used for something else at the end of the season (eg, a Joke Race).   Finally, on the question of the revote, I am happy to see that this is moving towards a resolution here. Hopefully there are important communication and governance lessons we all gain from this. I would hate to see revotes become a common thing or a new layer of bureaucracy added to decision-making.   I hope people find my comments constructive. I appreciate all of the commentary in this thread and hope this ends up being a net positive in the long run for GTC governance. ",
