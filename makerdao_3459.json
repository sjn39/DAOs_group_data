I was thinking about how to possibly utilize them in a way that would be helpful to Maker, and I would be interested in trying to push some kind of \u201cdonate DAI to charity\u201d setup. I know a few charities already accept DAI (like Save The Children). Because the IRS rules crypto as property, this means it would be a tax deductible donation for Americans, just like with dollars. I\u2019m still thinking through the details, but figure there could be two objectives: one is make DAI something more people in N Am and UK have heard of. The other is demonstrating a charitable, tax-deductible use case for DAI that doesn\u2019t require bullish holders of crypto assets to sell. Thoughts? Do we have any materials for this? What CU would I want to organize this with? Do we already have any charitable partners who emphasize DAI? Thanks! ",
