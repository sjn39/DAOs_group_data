                    "content": "Summary of the situation As first described and discussed in Upcoming COMP farming change could impact the Dai peg, a patch to Compound\u2019s COMP distribution mechanism which went live on the 2nd of July resulted in the leading asset used for \u201cCOMP farming\u201d to shift from BAT to DAI. The underlying reasons for this are believed to be that: (a) the DAI market on Compound has a special interest rate model which guarantees that the spread between the supply and borrow rates for DAI is almost always lower than for any other asset; and (b) since the supplier COMP yield is proportional to the borrow size of that asset, the mechanism encourages farmers to crowd into a single asset to maximise their COMP yield. The negative effects of this phenomenon on DAI stability have been widely discussed, but the main concern is that the COMP reward acts as an extremely high \u201cexternal DSR\u201d for DAI at a time when existing DAI supply does not warrant a high interest rate in order to promote adherence to the $1.00 price target, resulting in DAI getting bid up by COMP farmers and ultimately getting locked in Compound. Disabling COMP rewards for DAI On the 3rd of July, a discussion took place in the #governance-and-risk channel on rocketchat which raised the possibility of simply disabling COMP distributions for the DAI market, until both Maker and Compound communities arrive at a better understanding of how to avoid creating excessive pressure on DAI. This change is expected to be a simple one (for example, SAI is already excluded from receiving COMP rewards), and some members of the Compound community have signalled that they are open to supporting such a change. Alternatives There are a number of alternatives that have been discussed, which either seek to address the Compound side of the problem by changing either the DAI interest rate model on Compound or the COMP distribution methodology, or to address the DAI side of the problem by increasing DAI supply. They include:   A forum poll and executive vote this weekend increased the USDC-A debt ceiling to 40mm and the RP to 4%, in response to this problem.  A poll was made on the 30th of June to consider options, though this poll did not include the option of signalling to the Compound community in favour of disabling COMP rewards for DAI. There have been discussions in Upcoming COMP farming change could impact the Dai peg, the #governance-and-risk channel, and other places concerning the changes required to the DAI interest rate model on Compound that would push the farming equilibrium away from DAI. The PSM proposal has an ongoing poll asking if the PSM should be urgently implemented as an emergency measure. Implementing negative interest rates to counteract the excess demand (while effectively penalising COMP farmers who hoard DAI), even though a specific proposal for negative rates has not yet emerged.  Should MakerDAO signal that it prefers for COMP rewards for DAI suppliers and borrowers on Compound to be disabled?     MakerDAO SHOULD signal that it prefers for COMP rewards for DAI suppliers and borrowers on Compound to be disabled. MakerDAO SHOULD NOT signal that it prefers for COMP rewards for DAI suppliers and borrowers on Compound to be disabled. Abstain     0 voters     Next Steps: This poll will run for 1 week from the time that is being posted. If the number of votes cast at that point is less than 30, the poll will run for 1 additional week thereafter. If the outcome is that it SHOULD signal, then the MakerDAO community should formally propose to the Compound community that the change be made (whether or not this poll itself would be sufficient to act as this proposal is unclear, since the ultimate decision on this rests entirely with the Compound community).

                    "content": "Ok, editing it a bit to respond to IslandHunting\u2019s point. It\u2019s my personal opinion, but subsiding via minting MKR is quite inefficient way to fix the peg. I saw many posts point out that they are against it because it will trigger \u201cthe race to the bottom\u201d and that this kind of subsidy is not sustainable. Both are good points, but here is why economically speaking, it\u2019s less efficient than alternatives. Maker system shares many characteristics with countries with fixed pegs. And for these countries, it\u2019s relatively easy to fix the peg when it\u2019s above the peg. Why? Because they can print their own currency to buy other currencies to depreciate their own currency while increasing their foreign reserve. However, the current Maker system is less efficient at dealing with such because it requires excess capital as collateral to do so. In addition, as many collateral types are highly volatile, that means, further excess capital as collateral is generally practiced. In addition, while there are different ways of looking at it, circulating Dai supply seems quite inelastic because while the price and supply of Dai increased, Dai liquidity on Uniswap is flat (If it was elastic, a small increase in Dai should have significantly increased Dai liquidity and volume on exchanges such as Uniswap to sell Dai). Considering that it took a high stability fee to restore the peg when Dai was trading below $1, that also seems to hint that circulating Dai supply is inelastic. This means that even if there\u2019s subsidy, the effect will be quite small. In this regard, a more direct approach such as PSM is more capital efficient. In addition, PSM will likely make the circulating Dai supply curve more elastic as it makes \u201cthe production process\u201d of Dai simpler. ",

The purpose of the Maker governance is to maintain the peg in the face of DAI demand, not complain about said demand. The demand will increase across the DeFi space with projects like Augur v2 integrating the stablecoin tightly. Therefore, MakerDAO should focus on ways to get DAI back to the peg. Furthermore, signaling is a bit futile and just leaves the problem open: Compound might not change anything, or if not Compound, another project might do something similar and not listen to anyone telling them to stop.

I believe that this will communicate to the community and market that maker are reliant on the goodwill of our players in the ecosystem to maintain the peg and system - and that will lead to another slow bleed of confidence, since it shows that MKR is not able to handle market changes on its own. And foundational confidence in the system, particularly in time of criss, is the ultimate determination of success in financial infrastructure. ",

As long as people can make a yield higher than the +2% premium they aren\u2019t going to dump their DAI into the market. If compound disabled this then balancer or another protocol is going to be next. I think the PSM is a better solution for the peg going up, although I think it falls short for when the peg goes down due to its 1:1 rate, at some point the USDC reserves will dry. But that\u2019s not the current problem and I understand something more sophisticated like what mich suggested (Peg Stabilization Modules: A Pre-MIP Discussion) would take longer so I think the current proposal is the way to go.
