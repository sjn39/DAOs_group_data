Will try to do where I can knowing how communication can be segmented in the DAO:  A capital raise would be dedicated entirely to building a security cushion against \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019 deriving from structured exposures (treasury or RWA off-chain risk, stETH liquidity crunches, D3Ms protocol or collateralisation risks are example of what we have seen ex post and that couldn\u2019t be protected by collateralisation only) This \u2018insurance pool\u2019 sitting on top of the surplus buffer SHOULD NOT be used for ongoing investments and spending but actually sit idle to offer protection - as it is customary for financial institutions; this should be ensured by smart contract deployments The capital raise SHOULD NOT be completed thru dilutive token issuances but thru long dated, fixed rate, flexible bond-like vaults or instruments  As I have stated several times, we either go back to the core of being a ETH-focused pegged stable (a pegged RAI) or as soon as we expand to more complex uses (that make money) we need a buffer, because otherwise we will go the way of Terra and saving a few MM won\u2019t change anything. This is obviously only my opinion, although shared by others. Thank you and I hope to engage on constructive debate regarding this. ",

Also the ideas are decent but not really that great, the main focus seems to be raise money but there\u2019s no clear explanation for what that money should be used for, other than more RWA which i think is very unappealing because our RWA strategy is unfortunately a failure with unacceptable political dysfunction, gargantuan overhead and overwhelming complexity. No reason to do all those complicated things when we can just put it all in government bonds with simple structures like MIP65 or 6s capital. But even more importantly, this is just not the kind of complexity that should be prioritized at this stage, in my opinion. There are so much more critical things to do, such as fixing governance and budgets. I think it\u2019s good to have the proposal though, as I consider it an alternative proposal to my own endgame plan proposal (that I\u2019ve been doing calls about but the full details in text will be posted here soon), meaning whichever proposal prevails will become the \u201cconstitution\u201d for the future governance paradigm. I will of course do whatever I can to try to make the endgame plan win as it will provide a massive power boost to the project and create a lot much needed certainty about its scope. At the same time I personally don\u2019t see a bright future for the project if the \u201cgrowth task force\u201d becomes the foundation for the long term political dynamic. But it\u2019s always healthy to consider a long term direction in relation to other alternative possibilities to better understand the trade offs and strengths/weaknesses of a particular plan. ",

                    "content": "I\u2019d like to clarify my position with regards to the capital raise in a succinct way, even if the topic has more nuances than the below:  I agree a capital or debt-raise would provide an extra cushion for losses. The primary gain from such is to enable a \u201csafe level\u201d of possible innovation with technologies like D3Ms or certain RWA structures where the risks are higher than what the community wants to tolerate. But the long-term strategic gain might be there. Again the community of MKR tokenholders need to weight on it. The risks are in the HOW as usual, if the collective of MKR tokenholders think (1) is a good direction for Maker. That is not certain. Maker is an open source protocol, which is one of its core values. Any collective organisation to \u201cdesign that HOW\u201d, be it by core units, MKR tokenholders, open community, should be transparently agreed upfront in my view. RWF-001 as a core unit is currently not involved in the design of such capital raise. We believe there are benefits to it e.g. innovation, portfolio construction etc. But only if designed/proposed in a non-dilutive and transparent way (the \u201cHOW\u201d).  Last, but not least, I don\u2019t believe the strategy for RWAs is unsuccessful. There is complexity in these securitisations which was build out of the necessity of doing them right. And once done right,  evolving towards automating the processes is the direction of travel in my view. This second piece (i.e. automation) takes time but the learnings gained from doing them through Centrifuge, SocGen, HVB etc are priceless.  Nowhere else in DeFi there is the same experience as Maker is having. Single collateral DAI or Multi collateral DAI weren\u2019t built overnight either. Doing RWAs right and increasingly on-chain are equivalent to such enterprises. SCD started in 2014 and it took more than 4 years to be running with a whole Foundation with dozens of people focused on it. We\u2019re only getting that dedicated focus from committed multi-stakeholder groups right now. ",

If the Lending Oversight Core Unit will be voted in, it is part of its mandate to highlight the financial (not only liquidity) risk that any lending position entails. Suggesting an increase in risk buffering is one of the available mitigating actions - if done appropriately, and IMO we should explore it. Even simple structures like MIP65 or 6s\u2019 come with risks for the protocol that are in no way protected sufficiently by the current risk buffer. Again, either one or the other, a super simple and not so profitable \u2018pegged RAI\u2019 or a more structured and profitable meta-lender with adequate protection. We can\u2019t have both. The rest is speculation, which is unhelpful. I guess that the community should simply wait if a proposal is brought forward, and judge the why and how of that specific proposal. Continuing to witch-hunt that any proposal for the protocol is done by the CUs to extend their hand on protocol funds is truly not helpful. Personally, I dedicated enormous effort to try to help protect, professionalise, and scale this protocol while undergoing SES\u2019 incubation. And even if confirmed as facilitator of a core unit by governance, my financial compensation would be drastically below market value. I\u2019m doing this driven by long term thinking and strong belief, and being silenced on any occasion thru preconceived suspicion is at lest misinformed.

It has been shocking to see how quickly we\u2019ve lost income and at this point, I think those advocating for the raise should consider delaying it until the protocol has recovered.  When you were profitable, a raise wasn\u2019t viewed as suspiciously but now that expenditures are starting to get drawn from the surplus buffer, some people are going to suspect you\u2019re actually raising money to pay yourselves rather than stated intentions for growth.  In fact, as you\u2019ve lost so much DAI from nonstablecoin collateral, you actually need less buffer and have created more room for RWA projects that are spinning up.  I don\u2019t think the argument is there that you are bursting at the seams with loan demand right now while we\u2019re very slowly still figuring out how to integrate RWA and governments across the world are actively trying to slow demand in order to mitigate inflation. Do whatever you need to in order to get back to profitability, integrate some projects with low debt ceilings and get to the point where you\u2019re actually able to quickly increase debt ceilings\u2026then talk about a raise if it\u2019s still necessary. @rune I appreciate the time and thought you have spent on your end game proposal.  I can imagine a world where it works out but I somehow can\u2019t see it happening right now because I feel there isn\u2019t enough people involved with this project to make all the meta dao stuff work.

Every activity has an estimated (statistically) capital absorption, meaning that has some capital that should be kept aside to protect against \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019. The more structured it is, the higher that number is. If the raise will be brought forward, the proponents should provide a detailed estimate of why we need a specific amount of capital aside. The D3Ms greenlit by the community, like TrueFi and Maple, are both very structured and not fully collateralised and although with incredible potential they cannot be scaled without a risk cushion. At the same time I agree with @Traster_Tray - we should first put the rails for growth in place and then implement a raise if needed. And this is what is happening. Discussing and structuring any debt-based solution will require time, so we will have plenty of time to onboard eventually the D3Ms, RWAs, or any solution, at very modest size, and then propose a progressive raise to sustain extending those lines. It is however helpful to have these conversations, given how long it takes to do things well. ",

I can imagine a world where it works out but I somehow can\u2019t see it happening right now because I feel there isn\u2019t enough people involved with this project to make all the meta dao stuff work. I think the community needs to grow before trying something radically different like that and we have to find simpler ways to turn things around.   Thanks, this is great feedback about the kind of concerns people might have and I while I won\u2019t reply to it in detail here since this thread is already going off topic this line of thinking is something I will put a greater focus on addressing in the full post of the plan. I think with enough context you\u2019d be able to see that the plan already takes these concerns into consideration including how to reorganize the existing workforce so that it can be positioned to scale up the workforce and community further in a careful step by step fashion where any increases must be validated and funded, and all of this with minimal and derisked complexity.

We sell bond or whatever we issue with DAI, reduce the amount of DAI in the market but as demand of DAI stays probably the same it will be arbed by the PSM. If people holding idle DAI just convert it to the bond (unlikely in my view), then it\u2019s just a liability swap and there isn\u2019t even any impact on the asset side. Therefore nothing to be spent (nor invested) at all. Here are the balance sheet possible impacts of a bond issuance.  image964\u00d7592 11.9 KB  Obviously increasing the PSM by issuing interest bearing debt is quite stupid (assuming we like the current risk profile of the protocol), therefore it should be invested.

MIP65 for short-term bonds was approved an is in the work. In all fairness, MKR holders should consider issuing debt to burn MKR as well (nice way to come back to the topic). Assuming there is an equity-like way to issue debt, meaning providing same (or close to) protection to DAI holders but no MKR dilution, it should make sense to issue debt as we reduce the SB to keep the level of risk constant and not diminishing the protection to DAI holders.

I believe the @luca_pro is saying that the capital raise is supposed to be purely for allowing us to raise debt ceilings on those higher risk RWA loans which have much higher liquidity, credit, etc. risks than our loans backed by crypto collateral.  As I said earlier and @luca_pro agreed with, I think this whole discussion is unnecessary until the protocol proves we have loan demand in multiple places that necessitates a capital raise.  Right now we\u2019re losing loan demand (hopefully it has bottomed) on the crypto side and there\u2019s not much in place for RWA so there is no reason to do this.  On the RWA side, 6s and new silver are the only ones kind of close to their debt ceilings and those debt ceilings aren\u2019t anywhere close to the SB we already have. I understand if some of the CUs want to continue working on the mechanics of this so that we have something in place if there does come a time where a capital raise is necessary.  But again, we really don\u2019t need to talk about this until we actually see more RWA vaults doing well and hitting their initial debt ceilings.  Clearly there is not appetite to raise money for expenses but it\u2019s also just as clear to me, we\u2019ve also approved many budgets for the purpose of onboarding RWA and I doubt we\u2019re going to easily turn around and abandon that path.  There\u2019s really not much to do here but to wait and see if this protocol can figure out how to onboard RWA well and make money off of it.  If budgets get frozen and don\u2019t keep increasing, we should be ok even if we aren\u2019t making money.  We\u2019re not really running at a huge loss yet\u2026maybe we\u2019re not even running at a loss yet if CUs are able to return portions of their budget. ",

You don\u2019t raise just to invest in government bonds because the bond interest is going to be much less than the interest charged on your own bond issuance.  How you invest your assets is more of a way to earn additional income at the cost of liquidity constraint. From how I\u2019ve understood it, the real purpose of raising is so you can increase your DAI debt ceiling on your different collateral types comfortably.  Your buffer only needs to be a small portion of your max debt ceiling so a capital raise used for this purpose enables you to earn much more than the interest you pay on the debt.  You could invest the capital you get on top of that at the expense of liquidity but that\u2019s really just bonus income. ",

Also the ideas are decent but not really that great, the main focus seems to be raise money but there\u2019s no clear explanation for what that money should be used for, other than more RWA which i think is very unappealing because our RWA strategy is unfortunately a failure with unacceptable political dysfunction, gargantuan overhead and overwhelming complexity.   I am adding my own views here.  100% against a capital raise for the following reasons:  Every piece of documentation forum posts etc. on this subject - which should read like a prospectus is lacking basic costs, and explicit uses for the capital leading to expected revenues.   No single company would issue a bond, or stock (and this is particularly true of a stock issuance btw) without a exceedingly well thought out prospectus proposal laying out time frames, numbers etc.  But lets look at the basics as I have read them in various places.  Proposed is to raise something like 200M (to give MakerDAO something like 250M in capital) via two methods (or combination).  Selling MKR, borrowing DAI.    No discussion of what is the expected MKR price required to raise X capital.    There was a basic discussion of raising 200M in a bond that would cost up to 10% (1000bps) yr to service (this is up to 20M/yr cost). While I have seen numbers bantered around when I look at Maker RWA vaults they are not going to yield much over 200bps on average.  In fact our average return on all Vaults are basically around 50bps.   I don\u2019t see RWA vaults much over 200-300bps without significant additional risk and long time horizons.  Maker revenues from vaults is now 32M/yr and our expense run is something around 40M not including MKR vesting.    MKR market cap on even a 50M capital raise via MKR sale could easily drop another 200M market cap and require selling 50K MKR.    Interest on even 100M/yr at 5% for a 2-5 yr bond (if we could get that) is going to be 5M/yr.   So when we factor in RWF cost (7M+/yr?!) + the market cap hit and/or bond servicing fee of (5-20M/yr) you have to wonder in what world this makes sense to do?  Add up the numbers cost 5M/yr+7M RWF + perhaps 200M MKR market cap loss to have 250M in the bank which is going to earn us maybe 200bps on 500M (10M).   At a minimum you have to do 2 of these 500M 200bps vaults to be profitable provided these returns hold up and costs don\u2019t go up or returns down.  Or you have to do what 4 200M DC vaults earning 200bps to again just be profitable (this doesn\u2019t include buying back and burning the 50K MKR we sold or the 100M DAI we will need to pay back to bond holders).   We\u2019d have to do what double or triple the above and we can\u2019t even get out of the starting gate on even a 50M vault.  Now I have heard this 250M buffer is going to allow Maker to issue 500-1B RWA vaults.   I have always been an advocate that Maker could always do vaults with DCs that were basically under the current surplus buffer.  The idea here was to grow our existing vaults to that DC level and do \u2018many of them\u2019.   Spread the risk to a larger number, but smaller size and generate growing returns from them as you work out the kinks.   Not ideal, but far better than trying to do one single vault of 500M with a SB of 250M because if for any reason the value of that vault becomes inaccessible it basically puts the SB at -250M and DAI undercollateralized in accounting by at least 2-4%.    If everyone is ok with having vaults of 500M-1B with 250M SB what is wrong with having 100-200M vaults with 75M SB?   A sustainable approach is to start reasonably, measurably small and scale as proof of revenues manifests. If the idea is that this capital is to be used to fund L2s, wormholes, expanded CU budgets whatever again I don\u2019t see how these are ever going to fetch us fees over this 200bps level. The only way selling MKR here makes sense is if the DAO believes the MKR price is too high and is going lower in the future.  Then it makes sense to sell MKR to raise capital now and to use it to generate revenues to buy back MKR lower in the future, but be prepared for the PR and market reaction in the MKR price to such an announcement and move. I agree completely with @rune when he suggests:     rune:  No reason to do all those complicated things when we can just put it all in government bonds with simple structures like MIP65 or 6s capital. But even more importantly, this is just not the kind of complexity that should be prioritized at this stage, in my opinion. There are so much more critical things to do, such as fixing governance and budgets.   ",

You don\u2019t raise just to invest in government bonds because the bond interest is going to be much less than the interest charged on your own bond issuance. How you invest your assets is more of a way to earn additional income at the cost of liquidity constraint.   I would refer you to the post Toward taking asset risk and A Balance Sheet approach to executing an Aggressive Growth Strategy. Assuming short-term bonds provide a 2% yield and have a 5% Capital At Risk requirement, in order to invest 1B in short term bonds, you need 50M of capital. Assuming this 50M is debt and costing 10% the annual cost is 5M. But you get 20M interest revenues on the investment (1B) so you end up with 15M of profit. Assuming the cost of DAI holding stays next to null, you can check the RoE (return on equity) metric. You make a profit as long as the cost of equity (or equity-like debt) is below this number (which are always above 50% expect for stablecoins obviously). Those numbers are in the process of being updated.  @MakerMan the numbers you provide come probably from my post A Balance Sheet approach to executing an Aggressive Growth Strategy - The road to 300M revenues . All numbers where taken from my best guesses (incl. the 10% cost of debt) but based on the Maker Growth Strategy - We Must Act Now (Part 1) which was the most update information at the time, petitioning for a mix of debt and MKR issuance (hence why I modeled the two scenarios). The aim was really to get a sense of the impact of both to inform MKR holders. For completeness in this topic, the best way to increase capital is to get earnings. The analysis I made was on the premise that we implement everything tomorrow. If we ramp up over a year, that would be some fat profits before having the need for total capital assuming costs are under control. ",

You will generate enough capital in a year to move forward in the yield curve and earn more with more stability. As it will be a sizable investment, it will be an existential counterparty risk so no amount of capital will help for tail risks.

Sorry, but sometimes I need to re-read to understand your description  so this time I\u2019ll ask. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re saying short-duration bonds are more appropriate than long duration bonds, correct? As you know higher-yielding short-term investments can help hedge bond portfolios from the impact of rising rates(which is the current trend). Treasury bonds, municipal bonds and higher rated corporate bonds, IMO \u2014 that\u2019s more likely the way to go (for now). ",

Like say some hacker decides to effectively launder funds through Maker and the regulators/legislators react with same kinds of sanctions on Maker\u2026 You constantly talk about importance of decentralization yet seem to ignore how going to scale with RWA itself, and with the PSMs via USDC, USDP etc. have massively centralized DAI backing. To my mind anyone who really wants to have a decentralized financial instrument has to really wonder whether Maker growth (at all costs) is basically tossing out a decentralized collateral for centralized collateral creating existential risk for DAI holders.   As a DAI borrower - borrowing and converting DAI to something else with PSMs active is about as risk free put on DAI value as you can get.  But I don\u2019t see how RWA is the reverse \u2018risk free\u2019 put of USDC or other assets that helps DAI backing stay decentralized.  Return generating yes, risk free absolutely not. ",

                    "content": "Just adding more colour to what discussed here. Although sovereign exposures like US government are risk-weighted at 0 by banks when they calculate their exposures, that weighting refers only to credit risk of the issuer. There are several other risks that might impact such exposure (interest rate / duration risk as indicated by @SebVentures and @flipflopflapdelegate - which with the current IR environment is non-negligible, but also liquidity risk - low, counterparty risk - someone is holding that bond, and business risk in general). Even if low, those risks pile up when dealing with exposures at very hight quantum. It could also be argued that regulators give the benefit of 0 risk weighting to banks when they buy government bonds because they basically want them as buyer of last resort of all the sovereign debt and credit risk is actually not zero at all. The argument, as @MakerMan puts it, is that anything we do that has some type of structuring that goes beyond native $ETH has some type of risk. Counterparty / smart contract risk, liquidity risk - like the $stETH experience is teaching us, etc. We don\u2019t know how much we should keep aside to protect us against such risk, nor whether it will make the equation economical, but I think it\u2019s an analysis that must be done. Obviously those risks expand dramatically when we move off-chain even for perceived low-risk initiatives like MIP65. If we instead discuss about 6s, then the risks are several steps higher. I fully agree with many things said in this thread that we should be careful and rigorous if we want to raise (debt) capital to protect us, because such debt is going to cost us anyhow, and therefore we should do the math correctly to make sure we need it, and that it\u2019s economical and safely managed. What I want to stress, however, is that I don\u2019t feel (IMHO) that the right approach is the other extreme, which is to jump in doing complex structures with little visibility with our eyes closed and hope that everything is going to turn right. This especially today, with market participants ready to attack currencies as soon as the mere suspicion of weakness arises. ",

The longer the duration, the higher the unrealized loss (close to 1% per year of duration, so if interest rate are raising by 1% your 10-year duration bond value decrease by 10%). You can check, the long term bonds ETF is down 20% this year. To present it differently (forgetting about mark-to-market valuation), let\u2019s assume the whole balance sheet is invested in 20-year bonds at 3%. We would generate 3% a year currently as we don\u2019t pay DAI holders. But let\u2019s assume the t-bills interest rate are going to 10% and Circle start passing this yield to their USDC holders (i.e. they are getting 10%). We would be trapped as we would generate still only 3% (for the next 20 years), therefore it would be hard to pay 10% to DAI holders (creating a big loss). ",

                    "content": "Okay, I think I understand my confusion.  Your capital at risk is basically a metric to calculate the SB size requirement based on a specific asset class\u2019s vault size.  I think I would propose that you just start by investing in short enough duration where you can say CaR is basically 0 if you don\u2019t consider the existential risks of everything being frozen.  I also argue that your capital isn\u2019t really at risk in bonds.  Duration risk doesn\u2019t leave you with risk of actually losing capital unless you sell before maturity.  It\u2019s more an opportunity cost risk which is better than what we have now just holding non income generating DAI as cash. When considering the case where everything is frozen, 5% of your capital isn\u2019t going to help you. If the us government decides to freeze our assets, they\u2019ll likely freeze all of it.  And as we saw with UST, if for whatever reason usdc or any other stablecoin loses its peg for too long, it will likely go to 0.  That\u2019s partially why I don\u2019t really consider the DAI in PSMs when I think about how big the SB should be.  Perhaps there should be a separate discussion about how to spread around MKR\u2019s risks when working stablecoins or treasury bills.  But if you are too caught up with all the different unknown unknowns, you won\u2019t be able to compete and in my opinion, the risk that competition takes away all our demand is much greater than the risk of catastrophic loss. My inclination is to say ultra short term US bonds give us the ability to compete and pass through rates that the rest of the tradfi industry take for granted.  So then we can offer a competitive product and simply focus on increasing demand for DAI to increase profits rather than looking for higher margins that come with higher risk. ",

If you have a run and the PSMs start shrinking to a point where you\u2019re uncomfortable, you sell a portion of your tbills and refill the PSMs.  You don\u2019t have to sell everything\u2026just what you need to get back to comfortable levels.  Alternatively, and preferably to me, you monitor PSM levels and adjust DSR to maintain or grow demand and hopefully avoid ever having to sell your investments. ",

What do you do when your PSMs start draining to 0 and you don\u2019t have any money to increase the DSR sustainably?  You\u2019re pegged to a dollar that\u2019s controlled by a central authority.  As a stablecoin, you can\u2019t escape that.  If the fed raises rates to 20% like Russia\u2019s fed did, and banks passed along a portion of that rate\u2026why would anyone want to hold Dai that returns nothing?  How could you compete with that if you didn\u2019t also somehow get that 20% to pass along through the DSR?  These are honest questions from me and I would love to hear creative answers that I may not have thought of. Edit: here\u2019s maybe one answer\u2026you can increase your lending fees since lending rates should also go up.  But that means we need loan demand in those areas affected by interest rates\u2026right now, we don\u2019t really have that.  If your loan demand was high enough, you wouldn\u2019t have much of anything in the PSMs because all your DAI would be collateralized by some kind of asset rather than PSMs minting DAI in exchange for non interest yielding stablecoin.  So you could say the whole dependence on treasuries is a result from the lack of loan demand to match demand for DAI.  Then perhaps scaling RWA would also solve the necessity for finding yield through treasuries.  But it just doesn\u2019t seem like RWA is going to scale to billions in the near future so I still look to treasuries as our near term answer. ",

Given that, as we all mentioned, we want to focus on bringing revenues in first, and we want to engage in a debate on capital buffering with all the numbers in hand, I think there is no rush - but I am sure we can have more than one AMA on the topic when the right time will come. My case, again, is simple: if we want to do anything more sophisticated than lending vs. ETH (and especially D3Ms, RWAs, multi-chain expansions) we need a larger capital buffer. The alternative is going the Terra way - or just do nothing and stay unprofitable and volatile. There are many ways to ensure that a larger capital buffer is raised minimising costs for the protocol and risks of misappropriation, and we should explore those before any implementation. The devil is in the detail, so looking forward to a debate. ",

It will depend on inflation as well as the other central bank policies. If Europe and China are loosening, then we won\u2019t be excessively tightening. This is also why I support having a professional bond manager to navigate these unprecedented times.

Big banks underserve retail investors and small businesses. As interest rates rise, they will increase their lending rates while keeping savings rates depressed in order to increase net interest margins. They also have huge costs/overhead from red tape, maintaining branches and downtown offices, paying out high executive compensation, legal/accounting costs, regulation etc etc etc. Big banks don\u2019t even want to service retail accounts and small businesses of a certain amount anymore because the administrative costs and risks aren\u2019t worth it when they can just do business with big clients. If you want a loan or line of credit, they either tell you to get a high APR credit card or accept an egregiously high rate. DeFi has a lower cost of capital and can serve some of these underserved markets. Maker can benefit from increased rates because it grows interest rate income and increases competitiveness by undercutting traditional banks. If anything, I would say low interest rates hurt DeFi lending because why figure out DeFi when you can just borrow money against your house at 3%? When people can\u2019t get cheap money from banks anymore, they will shop for competitive rates. I think RWA is where Maker can tap into this competitive advantage and grow higher interest rate lines of business. If we don\u2019t get out into the real world, then the addressable market is just tech enthusiasts swapping tokens with each other. ",

In fact, it\u2019s very similar what I lay out when trying to answer my own questions about how to address rate increases.  But again, currently, we don\u2019t have RWA rails and we can\u2019t spin up RWA demand so quickly.  SO the flip side of what you just said is if we aren\u2019t able to take advantage of higher lending rates, we are left with decreasing demand for DAI if and when banks do pass along increases.  There may be efficiencies to doing DeFi RWA but as evidenced by all our expenses and how long it\u2019s taking, there are huge costs as well, especially when being the first to do this.  On top of not being able to easily spin up RWA vaults, we need this huge capital buffer to address natural RWA risks.  We don\u2019t have that kind of buffer and even with a 200m capital raise, I\u2019m not sure you can match the 4.5 billion in PSMs comfortably.  Even figuring out how to do a capital raise is consuming time and task forces that cost a million dollars are being proposed. We currently have a loan/deposit demand imbalance evidenced by all the money just sitting in PSMs.  My point is that there is an opportunity in ultra short term bonds where we can address this imbalance by finding loan demand from the US government.  We can throw billions at these ultra short term bonds WITHOUT any need for a capital raise.  To me, it feels like the simplest solution. If you mint DAI, you want to be making money on the collateral that\u2019s backing the DAI.  It doesn\u2019t matter if we mint 1 Trillion DAI if they\u2019re all just stuck in PSMs doing nothing.  In fact, it just hurts us to have bigger PSMs because it makes DSR increases that much more expensive.  The PSMs did a great job in giving us visibility into how much demand there is for DAI.  What we need is to finish the other part of the equation which is to actually make money on that demand.  Our net interest margin on all the DAI backed by stablecoins is 0 right now and with all our expenses, we no longer have the luxury of being ok with that.  If (and this is a big if) RWA spins up, you can reallocate funds in treasuries to RWA vaults with higher margins when it makes sense. ",

If Bacon Protocol can turn a lien on a house into an NFT, then MakerDAO should be able to turn a collateral assignment (i.e. lien) of life insurance into an NFT.

This RWA should be prioritized over all others since it offers: the liquidity of US Treasuries, the tax-free compounding of Roth IRAs, superior asset protection to a trust (bankruptcy-remote), a self-repaying loan, outsources dynamic hedging of index options/duration risk, interest paid on a cash value line of credit is tax-deductible, it would unlock billions if not trillions in locked up liquidity in the death benefit, and there is a nearly limitless appetite for these loans (IUL). As an aside, insurance can be used as an employee retention plan. Instead of giving people volatile MKR that may be worth more or less, you can loan money to finance the premiums in a policy whose cash value is growing and can be used to repay the original loan. Some refer to these as golden handcuffs because it ensures employees will stay for the insurance benefit like Jim Harbaugh. ",

The concept was developed independently by both John Marcus Fleming in 1962 and Rob...      Point here is that with the DAI PEG fixed to 1, and lack of capital controls the only thing one has left is rates, and if someone else is doing the rate management on the thing you are pegging to.  Your rates basically have to match or you face capital outflows. So you are absolutely correct in assessing that Maker reaction to capital outflows is highly tied to rates (both on DSR and on SF).   So SF will have to go up dramatically and so will DSR.  In fact these probably will have to be coupled to match the spread in borrow and savings rates in TradFI. I have also pointed out that should Maker act too slowly, incorrectly, or we just have a hard and fast market event because the PSMs don\u2019t have multiple tier structures (fee spreads) with increasing liquidity (there is one tier with 0 fees on tin/tout) once the PSMs empty it is going to be a PEG free fall that will be left to borrowers to take advantage of (DAI borrowers are in effect DAI short but they need to have cash/capital to buy DAI that is below $1 PEG once the PSMs empty. Treasuries will basically take part of (say USDC in the PSM) and buy USTs with some kind of duration.  Should Maker need this liquidity before maturity in a rate rising environment we will take losses trying to sell to raise cash.   There is an additional point some have mentioned but not really addressed - liquidity issues.   My problem isn\u2019t US treasuries, but the fact we are likely in a rising rate environment which makes it pretty dangerous to try to earn return in RWA using US treasuries, this is especially true if you need this liquidity to be on demand within days vs. months.

We have what 3B in stables in the PSMs.    I just looked up the 4 week t-bill return.  51bps currently. So we have to ask is there anywhere else we can get 50bps return that has lower costs, better liquidity that works for Maker. I have one ETH-USDC v2 LP in my last calc is earning like 1000bps/yr.   Sure you take on some ETH risk and the price volatility is sqrt(ETH_price_in_USDC).   Provided you believe in the long term ETH will rise in price each 100M worth of the above is going to give you the same 50bps return on 20x the USDC.   But you do have pricing risk in the short run if you need that USDC liquidity. Now we could invest in the above (say even 10M) and then we could borrow DAI from our own ETH-USDC v2 vault at 150bps and use that to earn in the GUNI USDC-DAI v3 - levering it up and or going to USDC with a D3M in say AAVE or COMPOUND when rates are above the 150bps etc. I was telling my friends that with return rates on bank accounts like .1%.  So if you have 100K in there you are earning like $100/yr.  If you can invest 5K in something that earns 8-10% (even if it has price volatility of up to 50-75%) you are going to to be doubling the return you are getting. Point here is when you are earning close to nothing on a lot of assets if you can find some high return investments you can still be mostly in cash and increase your returns dramatically by taking only a small fraction of your cash and looking at the highest returning, best longer term investments. To me this is ETH-USDC v2 because Maker needs ETH for gas, and we really want to diversify cash (USDC) we own into contracts that if impaired affects a greater part of the ecosystem (at least if we are going to play this existential game with these assets). The above is a single example of how Maker can earn return by creating some diverse investments in ways that don\u2019t mean we have to plow the huge chunks of the PSM liquidity into.  Keeping investments in 100% liquid things like Uniswap means your cash is close on hand if you need it.  But yes there are always tradeoffs and there is a universe of opinions on this. ",

What I want is something I can throw billions toward without having to worry about degrading returns.  I also would prefer seeking as low risk as possible so I don\u2019t have to worry about taking any kind of loss such a large investment when our SB is so small.  Actually, I\u2019m totally fine with doing these higher return actions with smaller amounts.  Be it crypto lending, liquidity pools, RWA vaults, or treasuries, we want to be able to deploy capital wherever makes sense.  But I think ultra short term treasuries can be our stopgap option whenever we\u2019ve exhausted all the better options for deploying capital or feel uncomfortable deploying more because of surplus buffer size.  Also that 51 bps is going up right now and is going to look much more appealing very soon. ",

If you can invest 5K in something that earns 8-10% (even if it has price volatility of up to 50-75%) you are going to be doubling the return you are getting.   Or you can open a Pacific Life IUL policy and dollar cost average premiums on a monthly basis effectively creating a monthly paying bond ladder. This comes with zero downside risk to your principal. If you use a 2.7x multiplier on the returns of the S&P you can outperform passive indexing massively. For example, March 2020-2021 the S&P returns 67%, but PacLife\u2019s returns are 153%. If you use the 5-year 110% participation index option, you can get tax-free returns of up to 270%. Higher risk-adjusted returns than anything else with the ability to refinance the loan on demand by unilaterally withdrawing the cash value and removing the lien on the policy.
