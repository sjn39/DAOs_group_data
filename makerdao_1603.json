                    "content": " Layer 2 Roadmap - History and Future In order to know how long it will take to achieve Multi Collateral Dai on L2, it is helpful to review past work and how the team got to where it is today to reveal lessons learnt, corrections that have been made, and therefore estimates for the path ahead. The following begins as a summary of the amazing efforts that delivered simple bridges and has gotten us within reach of deploying L2 \u2192 L1 Fast Withdrawals, the post then describes some of the delays that occurred, and concludes with a description of upcoming phases to achieve full MCD on L2.  History Exploration and research into Layer2 was prompted by high gas costs on L1 back in February 2021, and built upon discussions such as Vitalik\u2019s Incomplete Guide to Rollups. In those early days, PECU held community calls on how to expand the protocol, starting with the Optimism Bridge in March 2021, as well as general community information calls such as April 2021\u2019s Let\u2019s Talk about Layer 2, and even exploration into other implementations such as NEAR Protocol\u2019s Rainbow Bridge. These various community discussions led to the initial definition around PECUs Multichain Strategy and Roadmap Proposal for Maker in May 2021, which was shortly followed by a Proposed L2 Risk Framework, where the team expanded upon the approach as one starting with simple bridges, then advanced bridges and native DAI issuance. With community buy-in, and formalisation of PECU\u2019s mandate, work swiftly commenced in this direction with implementation ideas settling around Optimism and Arbitrum. The early design of the Optimism Bridge evolved beyond the idea of fDAI into an improved architecture, which was officially launched in July 2021, following polls to define Maker\u2019s Teleport Deployment and Associated Risk Parameters. The implementation was subsequently formalised in the implementation in MIP69 L2 to L1 Fast Withdrawals, where Debt Ceilings of 1M DAI were defined for Optimism and Arbitrum and submitted for formal submission in May 2022. These tasks were coordinated with Oracles to ensure destination and source chains correctly communicate to each other as per the Teleport Oracle Overview. While building deployments for the simple bridges, PECU was also working on building foundational architecture to support minting DAI and its interactions with the END contract which will later be needed as dependencies, these were deployed as part of the foundational L2 work in the May 18th executive. In parallel, June 2021, saw Arbitrum refactor their bridge design, PECU in-turn made the required updates and awaited completed audits. Then launching the Arbitrum bridge as described in the Timeline for Launching DAI on Arbitrum One and the following announcement of the Official DAI Token Bridge on Arbitrum One in September 2021 - in the Technical Spell to authorise governance control, alongside the supporting forum post. Along the way there were also some distractions, the most notable being the successful recovery of DAI from the Optimism Escrow on Jan 13th 2022. Other impacts also stemmed from research into a variety of hacks, including; Ronin, Polygon Network, Harmony and Solana amongst others, requiring additional scrutiny around our designs, in particular the flush architecture. PECU continued working on the longer term roadmap and introduced Maker Wormhole in November 2021, which has subsequently been rebranded to Maker Teleport. From this post it became evident that there was an underestimation in the level of effort wrt our timeline, which was originally targeting Q1 2022 for L2 \u2192 L1 Fast Withdrawals, as evidenced below, this has slipped to August 2022. With the above Maker Teleport implementation now defined, there still remained a need to quantify and define the risk framework for community awareness, which lead to our Fast Withdrawals and Risk Assumption document outlining implementation variations, solutions and as a result a similar debt ceiling for StarkNet, comparable to Optimism and Arbitrum in July 2022. Bringing us closer to current events, recent work has prompted us to focus on Arbitrum Nova and zkSync bridge development. This is being accomplished alongside our journey towards full L2 to L2 Teleport and our immediate milestone deliverable; L2 \u2192 L1 Fast Withdrawals, as documented in our July 2022 PECU summary. As these work items continue,  PECU will also revisit our original MultiChain Strategy with Growth to assess other new and evolving ecosystems as potential opportunities and partnerships for MakerDAO.  Retrospective Looking back on the deliverables over the previous year, a wealth of research and development has been completed - from simple bridges, to architecture that paves the way for minting DAI on L2. The obvious milestone to call out is our delayed delivery of L2 \u2192 L1 Fast Withdrawals which had originally targeted Q1 2022. This date slippage is due to additional research requirements in light of multiple bridge hacks and subsequent improvements to our architecture (in particular the Dai flush architecture) involving a variety of teams, namely Oracles and StarkNet, as well as third parties for audit reviews. Further delay was also attributed building an example demo UI and SDK for integrations. Similarly, it was also deemed necessary to ensure that monitoring is available at launch time. Occasional Governance redirection has also played a role in distracting team focus. In conclusion, the above has moved the L2 \u2192 L1 Fast Withdrawals deployment to the end of August 2022. Looking forward, the following is a series of phases outlining how MakerDAO will support the minting of DAI on L2.  Preliminary Future Roadmap To help the community understand the scope of work that stands ahead of us, PECU has grouped the outstanding work into phases, which can be thought of as customer facing milestones that continue on from the Simple Bridge work already accomplished (Phase 0). These phases are described in the following diagram:  1432\u00d71220 281 KB   Phase 1: L2 \u2192 L1 Fast Withdrawals This is the current phase of work which will enable users to complete DAI fast withdrawals from L2 to L1. Outstanding Work  SDK for integrations (Socket and Li.Finance) Simple UI example implementation Governance Executive (hand off to Oracles) MarComms coordination with Growth CU  Target for Optimism and Arbitrum: August 31st 2022 Target for StarkNet: End Sept 2022  Phase 2: L2 \u2192 L2 Full Teleport This work runs parallel with the above but has more complexity as it enables interaction across L2s. Users will be able to complete DAI fast withdrawals from L2 to L2. Remaining Work  DssBridge L2 Vat L2 DaiJoin  Supporting Work  Testing environment Team review/audits Deployment process Keeper management  Target for Optimism and Arbitrum: Tentatively end of Q1 2023 Target for StarkNet: Tentatively end of Q1 2023  Phase 3: Minting DAI on L2 With the addition of join adapters, users will be able to open vaults and mint DAI on L2 domains. Remaining Work Per Domain  Dog Clipper p/ILK End Spotter OSM/medianizer (per token) Cure JoinAdapters (per ILK) Jug and the Pot PSM - considered for for DAI liquidity during liquidations Vow Flaps/Flops - pending whether debt is pushed to L1 or not DSR considerations  Support Work  Including; monitoring, alerting, keepers and UI frontend enhancements  Target for Optimism and Arbitrum: Tentatively end of Q2 2023 Target for StarkNet: TBD pending above contract rewrite in Cairo  Phase 4: Extend MCD Users can perform flash minting and capabilities are extended to other L2 collateral types. Remaining Work to enhance MCD capabilities on L2:  DssFlash D3Ms PSMs - if not needed in Phase 3 MIP21 to support RWA aspirations  Target for Optimism and Arbitrum: Tentatively end of 2023 Target for StarkNet: TBD pending Phase 3  As further research and development is completed, it is possible that there may be shifts in the above phases of work. If these occur, PECU will inform the community and dependent teams as necessary. PECU also plans to maintain its standing Tuesday weekly meeting in the Maker calendar where progress is documented and tracked - anyone is welcome to join! ",

Derek:  it is possible that there may be shifts in the above phases of work.       Derek:  L2 \u2192 L1 Fast Withdrawals which had originally targeted Q1 2022.   Given that delays are only naturals, and to be expected, especially given the very fluid and fast-changing crypto environment, and since     Derek:  Tentatively end of 2023   could easily turn into Q1 2025, my question for you is/are:   Q1: If given the resources (money) would it be possible to expand PECU and move faster?  Q2: How much of an expansion should be necessary to move from a \u2018Tentatively\u2019 target to a \u2018High confidence\u2019 target?  MakerDAO is currently ahead, today, in terms of its stablecoin L2 technology vs the competition. But this will not necessarily last much, especially if others can look at our sourcecode and clone. The current competitive advantage could easily evaporate if we don\u2019t push on the accelerator now. IMHO governance should seriously consider to view software DEV as the n1 priority and boost resources in this direction (e.g., expanding PECU, or adding a PECU2, etc). If necessary, cutting resources elsewhere. ",

Question on Phase 3 vs. Phase 2:  I personally imagine the L2<->L2 business case smaller than the vaults on L2. As a user I don\u2019t tend to have the need to bridge from a L2 to another L2. I would imagine also that leverage on L2s would become more interesting, hence having MCD on L2 be a bigger business case.  Do you have some data, or \u2018feel\u2019 for the above sizing?

PECU has bandwidth for additional hires and is building a pipeline of candidates. The challenge however is not just getting new people, it is getting them up to speed on the Maker protocol well enough to be able to rewrite Maker contracts safely on L2s. So, yes, we are working to accelerate the timelines. There is also a certain level of distraction re: EndGame, MetaDAOs that makes future planning sometimes uncertain. That said though, now that we are in the final stages of D3M review, the rest of the team will be freeing up to dedicate more time to this as well. Q2: How much of an expansion should be necessary to move from a \u2018Tentatively\u2019 target to a \u2018High confidence\u2019 target? The tentative target was not so much a reference to staffing, but more a reference to ecosystem/development unknowns - for example some of our past work was delayed due to research and improvements following other protocol hacks, similarly, there was an expectation on 3rd parties to build UIs out of the gate, but as their internal priorities changed, we needed to pivot to focus on SDK and demo UI implementations to help potential integrators. So, this is mostly a reference to dependency risks and architecture changes as we really are on the cusp of doing something new and experimental here - like you say it is a fluid and fast changing environment.

You could quantify the L2 \u2192 L2 use case by looking at Hop protocol or seeing how much is passing through the Optimism/Arbitrum bridges on L2Beat - Growth may have more specific data.
