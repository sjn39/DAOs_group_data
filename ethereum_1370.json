Would love to get your opinions, feedback, and ultimately your support for this decision as we think it\u2019s a step in the right direction for the ecosystem as a whole. Our post: https://medium.com/mycrypto/a-safer-mycrypto-79d65196e7d8 In an ideal world, other developers would begin to implement this. ",

It may require a clear screenshot saying: this is how you\u2019re going to transact on the URL-reachable dapp, otherwise you\u2019ll need to download to transact the way you might be used to.

                    "content": "As a developer/advanced user, I will find this mildly annoying.  I often use MEW/MyCrypto to validate my application, troubleshoot problems with signing or keys, test that my libraries are doing the right thing, etc.  I use MEW/MyCrypto because it is convenient, I can access it from anywhere, doesn\u2019t require signing up for anything or downloading anything, and it supports a number of options so I can troubleshoot many things in one place. That being said, I can appreciate the desire to protect users.  I worry that requiring users download something before they can use their keys will turn a lot of people away from MyCrypto.  This feels like a trade-off between security and usability and almost always usability wins.  For example, people may simple switch over to using MEW (or any competitor) rather than sacrifice the usability of a website. In general, I am of the opinion that \u201cyou can lead a horse to water but can\u2019t make it drink\u201d applies here.  MyCrypto has done a lot to help educate users but some will slip through the cracks and get burned.  I personally believe that in order for us (humans) to learn as a whole we must be willing to accept some casualties along the way.  Requiring an app download takes power and usability away from users, rather than continuing to try to train them to use good operational security.  IMO, this isn\u2019t a good long term solution, though it probably will help reduce losses short term. ",

                    "content": "It\u2019s definitely a bold choice\u2026  I love the sentiment, but I can\u2019t see how this will possibly be good for MyCrypto, since even those of us who appreciate what they are doing are also not thrilled about the impact to usability.  Wrt the website, MyCrypto hasn\u2019t differentiated themselves enough from MEW to really give users a good reason to stick with MC over MEW, which I think is unfortunate. Perhaps the real issue here is with timing, and once MC has a bigger reach they can start making the Apple-like innovations. I can definitely see this leading to an exodus (lol) from MC back to MEW and other wallets, which both defeats the purpose of removing PK access but also subjects users to the arguably less secure MEW/other services.  I say arguably less secure just because of the differences in quality of the codebases between MEW and MC. This decision doesn\u2019t increase current security, it just removes less secure features that are already standard in the industry.  Perhaps the better choice is to sacrifice something other than usability to achieve better security, all while adding features.  It\u2019s completely anti-MyCrypto philosophy, but maybe adding 2FA to PK access methods is a better way to go for both the company and community?  I think this would mean centralizing aspects of MC, as well as compromising anonymity to an extent, but it does increase security across the community moreso than everyone just switching to MEW.  This also differentiates the desktop app from the website even more, hopefully encouraging more people to use it instead of any website (which is one of the best outcomes possible). Another thing I\u2019m concerned about is how this decision will ultimately increase the dependency on MetaMask.  There\u2019s a surprisingly large amount of people using hardware wallets (not sure how popular the Parity Signer is), but for those who aren\u2019t, they are left with only one way to access their funds and it\u2019s through a product that the MyCrypto team has very little control over. What happens if a vulnerability is found in MetaMask?  What happens if the app page gets compromised and everyone with MM now has a malicious program installed?  From a security standpoint, browser plugins are one of the worst offenders for wide-spread attacks, and they can impact even those with good security practices. MetaMask is/was already a huge privacy problem, and encouraging people to use it is a double-edged sword IMO.  I\u2019d rather it be a more optional choice for those wanting to use MC. Perhaps another thing to consider is a MyCrypto \u201clogin\u201d plugin that is separate from MM?  I imagine it could be quite small and secure, and removing all the Web3 stuff would make me rest just a tiny bit easier. ",
