Congratulations to us all and a massive thank you to the Foundation for making this possible. Naturally, this spawned multiple discussions on whether certain ideas/MIPs/groups could be funded using this windfall. For example, here and here. There are also discussions from Black Thursday victims along these lines outside the forum. Not to call anyone out in particular (I had some ideas myself too so I can relate!) but it seems like being flush with cash can result in some sub-optimal spending decisions, even as a DAO. When someone wins the lottery, it helps to not change much for a while to let the new reality sink in. Given that the protocol has no pressing financial needs, should there be some sort of cooldown period before formally initiating plans for how to allocate these funds? I am not specifying the length of time, nor am I specifying what \u201cinitiating plans\u201d means. Obviously, discussions on the Forum will not be bound by this but perhaps on-chain polls/signal requests can be. In any case, I just want to get a feel for what people think before we put in specifics. EDIT: Sorry for the incorrect formatting where the title of the poll has become an option. I assume those who voted for it are voting that it\u2019s a reasonable question to ask      Should there be a cooldown period before deciding how to spend the MKR tokens from the Foundation Yes No Abstain     0 voters     ",

As you can keep for ever the company control by minting and redistributing the new share to yourself to stay over the 50%. If we burn, if we were regulated, that means we would have to buy the new share or if we decide to mint we should, I believe, provide a fair way to let share holder buying the new mint to avoid forced dilution. That means time and a way to contact them. Tho, I am not an expert on it and this is just my thought. Also regulating is probably country depends too. ",

                    "content": "There\u2019s already many millions of dai in the surplus buffer, so if there was no rush to spend those, then there should be no rush to spend the newly acquired MKR either. If this MKR is spent badly, it will end up doing more harm than good for the project. At best it will unnecessarily dilute the amount of MKR in circulation (as others are pointing out, using the MKR is the same as printing new MKR). At worst it could create a culture of reckless spending that makes the DAO unable to operate sustainably in the long run, and could see cash grabs and extractive behaviour from opportunistic core units. Now of course if someone has a good and effective idea that will provably help the project, that should always be considered. But like I said, we already have all the resources we need sitting in the surplus buffer, so getting funding to great ideas shouldn\u2019t really change just because there\u2019s now also a bunch of MKR sitting in the GSM.
