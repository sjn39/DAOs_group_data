                    "content": "One of the most important ingredients for a successful defi ecosystem is a highly secure price oracle. Algorithmic stablecoins (eg. DAI, RAI, LQTY) depend on a price oracle, synthetic assets of any type depend on a price oracle, collateralized loans depend on a price oracle, as do many other types of projects. Uniswap does provide an \u201coracle\u201d for the price of ERC20s traded on the exchange, but this is not a true oracle as it does not provide the price of anything in the outside world. This is a problem: algorithmic stablecoins need an oracle for the price of ETH/USD to be able to function, and they specifically need an oracle for USD the off-chain fiat asset, and not any specific on-chain instantiation of USD. Similarly, synthetic assets need an oracle for the price of ETH denominated in whatever asset they are mirroring. I recommend that Uniswap and the UNI token step in and provide such an oracle (eg. modeled after the Augur or UMA design), specialized to providing price data that\u2019s robust and extremely costly to manipulate and attack.  Outline of this post  Stablecoins need an oracle for the price of ETH/USD (see above) Workarounds like taking the ETH/USDC price are NOT sufficient Chainlink is great, but there\u2019s room for a simple alternative specialized for high-value, okay-with-high-latency use cases UNI is in an excellent position to be a token for such an oracle More broadly, Ethereum L1 needs to remain governance-minimalist, but L2 should be more ambitious, and UNI can be part of that   Workarounds like taking the ETH/USDC price are NOT sufficient The goal of algorithmic stablecoins is to try to be maximally censorship-resistant and robust by being free of dependencies to the \u201cfiat world\u201d. If this goal is not important to a stablecoin user, then they can avoid algorithmic stablecoins\u2019 technical risks by just using USDC directly. If this goal is important to a stablecoin user, then it\u2019s important to avoid not just direct dependencies on the fiat markets but also indirect dependencies. Using the ETH/USDC price as a proxy for ETH/USD does not achieve that goal, because such system is still ultimately dependent on USDC continuing to exist and being freely tradeable. Taking the median of multiple ETH/stablecoin rates (eg. USDC, GUSD and USDT) is at best a small improvement, because the traditional financial system is quite coordinated and can easily become less friendly to all asset-backed stablecoins simultaneously. Hence, if we want to have algorithmic stablecoins that fulfill the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of their category, an oracle that provides the price between ETH and the USD in the fiat world is needed.  Chainlink is great, but there\u2019s room for a simple alternative specialized for high-value, okay-with-high-latency use cases Currently, most \u201cgovernance-minimized stablecoins\u201d are using Chainlink as their oracle. Chainlink is really valuable for many oracle use cases, but it is also a complex system with many features. Incentives are not as clean as they are in eg. Augur; in particular, there is not an automated mechanism by which participants who provide wrong answers get penalized. Much like it\u2019s desirable to complement MakerDAO with more minimalist stablecoin alternatives like RAI (disclosure: I hold both MKR and Rai\u2019s FLX) so that the ecosystem can be more resilient through the diversity of different approaches, it also seems desirable to complement Chainlink with a more minimalist alternative that\u2019s more laser-focused on optimizing incentives and maximizing cost of attack. A robustness-favoring oracle should target these properties even at the cost of being okay with tradeoffs like long resolution times and being limited to one specific type of data (price indices for highly liquid assets).  UNI is in an excellent position to be a token for such an oracle Decentralized price oracles (at least, if they want to avoid dependence on an identity layer) need to have a token for sybil-resistance. Holders of the token are asked what the price is, and typically an economic mechanism is introduced where those who provide the majority answer are rewarded and those who provide the minority answer are penalized. If the majority of token holders are corrupted, they can successfully impose an incorrect answer, and at that point it\u2019s up to the minority holders to create a fork of the system where the attackers\u2019 coins are zeroed out and convince the community to prefer the fork from that point forward. The cost of such an attack is thus half the market cap of the token, minus some amount to account for very lazy holders who are not willing to participate in a vote even in an extreme emergency that could cost them their coins. For this reason, a robust token-based decentralized oracle for a defi project must first and foremost be based on a token with large market cap. Efficiency of an oracle is not important: an inefficient oracle can always be augmented with a game where one party claims a value and only if another party disagrees is the oracle actually called. Cost of attack, on the other hand, is absolutely essential to maximize, and thus market cap is key. And the two Ethereum project coins out there with the highest market caps are\u2026 LINK and UNI. Supporting oracles would not just be an act of altruism for Uniswap; in fact, Uniswap heavily benefits from the existence of a more robust stablecoin ecosystem. Uniswap v3 is heavily optimized toward ultra-high capital efficiency for stablecoin <-> stablecoin trades, and is likely to earn very high amounts of fee revenue from these trades. If we start to also see high-volume and robust synthetic assets emerge on-chain, then this is even more valuable for Uniswap.  More broadly, Ethereum L1 needs to remain governance-minimalist, but L2 should be more ambitious, and UNI can be part of that The Ethereum ecosystem aims to be the base layer of a fundamentally broader set of applications than preceding blockchain platforms attempted to cover. The goal is not just supporting holding and transfer of a basic asset, but also a decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and also increasingly a decentralized governance (DeGov) ecosystem. There\u2019s also a large need for public goods funding in the Ethereum ecosystem. Supporting this broader vision requires something more expansive than \u201cjust a blockchain\u201d. Arguably, it requires taking a few steps in the direction of the \u201ccrypto state\u201d vision, expanding the services that the blockchain ecosystem provides to not just security but also oracles, dispute resolution, public goods funding, identity, etc. But in order for Ethereum to be a stable platform, there is a need for the blockchain base layer to be governance-minimalist. The governance minimalism gives users confidence that applications that they care about will not be interfered with, and that the base layer will not be ripped apart by political conflicts over addition of controversial features. Hence, these services need to somehow be provided at layer 2. MEV auctions on rollups to fund ecosystem-wide public goods, as being implemented by Optimism, are one example of this. And Uniswap, as a decentralized exchange that is core to the Ethereum ecosystem also taking on more responsibilities (including price oracle provision) is another natural potential step in this direction.

My hope is it does not require extensive hardware requirements like running a full node. To be an oracle reporter is to be a holder of UNI, or does it require also being a Liquidity Pooler (with locked up funds) to gain UNI incentives or potential slashing in the case of maliciousness? Is being an oracle a passive or active experience? I.e is the oracle in the center (like the treasury) passively running and token holders vote as a whole occasionally during a price dispute, or is each UNI token holder or LP\u2019er actively reporting specific paired pricing constantly. How is off-chain currency data aggregated with UNI oracles? I am in support of an improvement that allows token holders to become more engaged in the Ethereum ecosystem. ",

Meanwhile the full market cap of the LINK token can be dedicated to purchasing data and securing it when the staking mechanism outlined in their 2.0 model is deployed. No cross-utility to worry about spreading the cryptoeconomics around, it\u2019s fully oracle focused. May edit this with more thoughts as I further process the proposal. Edit: As I outlined further below, my conclusion here is this both solves the issue in a lesser manner than Chainlink and also burdens Uniswap development with a specialized use not core to their product. This Augur arbitration model is not exactly a simple extension of Uniswap\u2019s current oracle model, it\u2019s a whole new economic system tacked on for one specific case. Furthermore Chainlink is already solving this in the same way with their proposed two tier arbitration system that lets latency tolerant contracts (like what\u2019s proposed here) go into an Augur style resolution (also like what\u2019s proposed here) but the difference is that the security of Chainlink\u2019s model has n^2 scaling with the value of LINK whereas the Augur/UMA model has 1/2n scaling. So basically this seems like extra work for the Uniswap team just to result in something similar to Chainlink 2.0 but less effective. ",

Collateralized stablecoins like DAI/RAI (which are backed by ETH and other on-chain tokens) need to be able to liquidate undercollateralized positions in a timely manner for the protocol to stay solvent, otherwise the peg of the stablecoin can break when collateral is less than the debt/stablecoins minted. Augur-style disputes can take days to weeks to resolve, by which point it may be far too late to do anything about the situation, leading to the loss of user funds and a loss of confidence in the stablecoin. We can imagine a flash crash scenario where the price of a collateral asset drastically falls during a period of extreme Ethereum network congestion. Will UNI holders be incentivized to put the collateral price on-chain in a timely manner when gas fees are 1000+ gwei during a flash crash? What would be the consequences of price data not being posted on-chain within the timeframe required for viable liquidations? A dedicated decentralized oracle network consisting of nodes whose sole business is to provide reliable data even during the worst of network conditions are highly incentivized to post data during these conditions as their long term revenue depends on their personal reputation/performance history and the value of the token they hold and are paid in depend on the reputation/performance history of the network as a whole. Creating an oracle system requires a lot of resources for development, monitoring, upkeep, and support. Creating an oracle as a side project would siphon resources away from development of the Uniswap DEX, the primary product offering from Uniswap. There are also open questions here such as where the data would be sourced from, how often the price feed should update, how much each token holder should be paid, how much they should be slashed, how forks would be handled from a user\u2019s perspective, how long disputes should last, how a network of voters would be bootstrapped, how users will be onboarded and supported during integration, etc. In my opinion, using Chainlink as an oracle and using Uniswap as a DEX is the best possible equilibrium where resources aren\u2019t wasted and users are provided the highest quality infrastructure at the lowest cost (economies of scale provided by the Chainlink network through the shared cost model of the reference contracts). If interested, I can provide additional context on the existing cryptoeconomics of the Chainlink network today as there are indeed financial penalties for posting incorrect data. ",

There\u2019s always the chance of a blockchain attack at the same time as a market crash; indeed, a period of high market volatility is the best time to attack the chain! There\u2019s a reason optimistic rollups have a 1 week finality period, and stablecoins need to start thinking in those terms as well. A 1.5x liquidation margin is a good start; perhaps that needs to even be pushed slightly higher. Obviously you can have more security during those periods when the network is doing well, but you can\u2019t rely on acceptable network latency absolutely. Also, I should repeat when I said in an earlier reply: the oracle does not go immediately to \u201ceveryone votes\u201d. You only need a single liquidator to kick off the process, and that is something that can happen quickly at least during non-attack periods. ",

For contracts ok with long resolution times, Chainlink will have a second arbitration layer that\u2019s basically the same thing that\u2019s been outlined here with the Augur comparisons. I guess I\u2019m struggling to see why we\u2019re trying to solve this hyper-focused oracle use case with a governance token for a DEX when we already have an oracle focused project solving it. Competing solutions are great but this kind of feels like a tacked on feature with how specialized it is. Why burden Uniswap with developing this very particular use case that\u2019s orthogonal to their core use case?     vbuterin:  And this is exactly why I am proposing that the absolutely-massive-market-cap UNI takes on this task!   Chainlink\u2019s staking system has a quadratic scaling effect, the proposed Augur/UMA model does not. As mentioned in the OP, the Augur/UMA model has an attack cost of 1/2n, significantly less than Chainlink\u2019s n^2 that comes from concentrating the staking rewards from all nodes into one. So yes, UNI\u2019s market cap is massive but LINK\u2019s is as well, uses that capital more efficiently by a power of 2, and has better incentives to keep that massive market cap (staking and utility purchasing data) whereas UNI\u2019s value comes from governance.

                    "content": "I do think it would be great for DAOs to also double up as oracle systems. DAOs make profit and hence have something to lose from being malicious, they\u2019re also often decentralised which makes coordination for the sake of collusion harder. But I don\u2019t know if Uniswap is capable and willing to work on this, I\u2019d rather see more oracle-focussed project build the infrastructure and then incorporate the UNI token for security. Securing oracles involves a large number of hard research problems that ethereum researchers are only now waking up to.   Expectation of profit. Market cap remains high because of expectation of profit. What happens when the expectation of this profit crashes? Equity-like models where tokens earn profit till end-of-life have various valuation models - they all indicate that expectation of future profit can crash much faster than actual profits in the present. Thorchain and UMA have independently suggested changing the fees charged to ease in and out of such crashes, it\u2019s a start but not a complete solution yet.  Competiton may be bad. Such expectation crashes could also means, prima facie, we should try to limit competition between oracle systems because it\u2019s the existence of competitors that cause projects to crash. There\u2019s a reason we don\u2019t have competing courts or judiciaries in the real world. Merging existing oracle systems - chainlink, uniswap, UMA, etc is a way to increase security without competition. But this increases bureaucratic burden just like in the legal system.  How much value is secured? It\u2019s hard to place a cap on how much value your oracle secures, as doing so breaks some types of synthetics and mechanisms. Unless the oracle is permissioned, it could be securing value without having any on-chain awareness as to which all projects are querying it. In fact, deliberately putting too much value on the oracle to secure is an attack vector because it forces everyone else out of the market because they can no longer trust the oracle. The oracle operator themselves can create such a situation.  Voter apathy. People don\u2019t operate strictly on risk-adjusted returns, they operate on laziness adjusted returns. There\u2019s plenty of millionaires who still use Infura + etherscan instead of running their own ethereum node, so it\u2019s possible 51% of the market cap can\u2019t be made to show up for a vote even if their wealth depended on it. Bringing everyone online for a vote amounts to a social coordination problem which can, in my opinion, take weeks. Hence the reasonable threshold has to be much lower than 51%, which begs the question, how much?  Delegation. Above point indicates that we should have mechanisms for delegation. What are the best mechanisms?  Coordination premium. Using a DAO like Uniswap instead of a single actor has the primary benefit of decentralisation. Corrupting the oracle requires coordination from a number of actors. How do you measure how much additional security this lack of coordination affords us?  Subjectivity. Dealing with messy real word data involves edge cases. These edge cases too are an attack vector because people are reluctant to vote if they know they will be penalised for offering an unpopular answer to an ambiguous query.  Data sourcing. Where is data being sourced from, what is it\u2019s quality, what is it\u2019s uptime, what do you do if that source is not available, and so on. This is probably one area where Chainlink does well.  I do think connecting to the real world is the most signifcant problem that ethereum needs to solve, and I have previously written about the oracle problem (noma.substack / oracle problem, this forum doesn\u2019t allow links). I\u2019d just rather see a more dedicated and collaborative effort from the ethereum community, than rushing it through with a single team who, until now, hasn\u2019t been focussing on this as its primary challenge.

Sir , my village would like to educate you. Chainlink does objective inputs, Kleros would do subjective inputs. If uniswap were to pivot to oracles, they would have to be objective inputs. I personally don\u2019t see any value in uniswap pivoting to the oracle space, it seems to me a waste of resources. I understand wanting to move governance to l2 and give the uni token some utility, but I suspect there are more interesting things you could do with the token to add value rather an oracle. ",

I actually wonder what the UMA people would say to this; the \u201cuse some kind of escalation mechanism as an oracle\u201d is an idea that as I remember they were the most focused on.   You could potentially avoid that significant decrease in overall capital efficiency during normal functioning markets by allowing for an immediate liquidation using a fast oracle like Chainlink, but those fast liquidations must be secured by a bond until the escalation/consensus based oracle is finalized. Instead of the escalation-based oracle being burdensome to everyone all the time, as it would be if you raise liquidation thresholds, the bonding only only makes the escalation oracle more burdensome to the ecosystem during periods of stress. That burden is aligned with when the oracle is systemically needed to be trustworthy. The increased capital for liquidations and slight risk to the liquidators due to oracle disagreement could be problematic during black swan events without some lender of last resort, though. I agree that a trusted oracle linking the native asset securing the base layer to the rest of the global economy is a public good of paramount importance. I\u2019d question if something as fundamental and timeless as this should go beyond the responsibility of one protocol that easily wane in its ability to provide the economic security. A coalition of stakeholders (UNI, AAVE, COMP, etc.) could be better stewards and lead to broader adoption and stronger oracle consensus. But, that comes at the risk of being too complex and the project never coming to fruition. ",

The CL 2.0 staking mechanism is clearly an improvement over their current system and a step in the right direction, but ultimately depends on the Tier 2 robustness, which as of right now and with the little information we have about it does not seem to offer the same cryptoeconomic guarantees than the mechanism proposed by Vitalik here (no Augur style token voting for tier 2), to the benefit however of a greater flexibility that this mechanism could not offer. Like mentioned in the proposal, different use cases = flexibility vs laser-focused. This might change with future development about Chainlink Tier 2, though. And to answer Kiba\u2019s point, I would think UNI is better for token voting as a large amount of LINK tokens would already need to be staked in DONs, requiring tier 2 operators to unstake their tier 1 tokens each time there is a vote, which would probably be an issue if they have to vote often (possible if they act as tier 2 for several tier 1s). My doubts are more about time/ressource allocation, possible voters apathy that could be higher than we might anticipate thus decreasing the perceived amount of cryptoeconomic security, questions related to the collateral needing to be provided by liquidators, and also Micah\u2019s points raised above. I don\u2019t have a strong opinion for now but I\u2019m interested in seeing these details ironed out. ",

This is one monolothic oracle network vs the isolated and customizable oracle networks of Chainlink so also less minimalistic from an architecture standpoint as well.   My concern is that for price oracles that need to care exclusively about maximizing cost of attack, monolithicness is actually good. You want to use an oracle system where, in the case where an attacker buys up 51% of the oracle tokens and uses them to cause a single incorrect price to be reported, the oracle token blows up completely and goes to zero (the market value going into a fork that zeroes out the attacker). You don\u2019t want an oracle system where if an attacker takes over a large share of the system (including the reputation layer, including\u2026), they can just interfere with one result and there isn\u2019t that strong social contract of tight coupling that even one incorrect result is unacceptable. Chainlink has always seemed to me to have more of a \u201cchoose and pay for the level of security you want\u201d ethos and relies on quick automated responses, which is really nice for a lot of applications but is somewhat opposed to what ultra-high-value defi oracles need. In addition to the security issue above, you want delayed and even human-mediated responses in case the centralized APIs of the markets are attacked. Though if Chainlink does change itself in a direction that supports maximum-cost-of-attack-demanding oracles, I would definitely be happy with that too! ",

This creates a situation where only one node needs to be honest, and while there is still a need for consensus it puts in check any incorrect answer so that this answer is not reported/accepted to/on the blockchain. Therefore every single node would need to be compromised, thus making an attack way more expensive than what you\u2019d gain from that attack.

A user in turn disputes the price, and argues the price of ETH was clearly $4000 and that the other source had failed to update, lacked volume, or simply wasn\u2019t representative. Is that user right? By the letter of the law, no. But, by the spirit of what the oracle is supposed to represent? Maybe. Oracles of non-binary outcomes should not expect that the vast majority of users act in a rational, letter of the law, technical code as law kind of manner. It\u2019s much more of a subjective jury trying to interpret \u201cwhat is real and accurate as they understand it\u201d Given the points in #1 I think you likely don\u2019t want users being able to dispute the specific price. Instead the minimal governance path is probably the election and removal of acceptable providers. Or, we need to begin to rethink not only how we think of oracles, but also smart contracts, and take a lesson from finance where we aren\u2019t just returning a single price and saying \u201cthis was the price in this moment\u201d but giving an OCHL (open, close, high, low) bounds and letting defi contracts deal within a range. #2 - How can disputes be secured and yet accessible? #2A - Engagement vs Thresholds We can say that the cost to attack a system of disputes that involves staking requires a >51% of the token supply but this can be done of two ways: A) Hard voting threshold conditions. B) Subjective voting threshold conditions. In hard voting conditions we say that you must have >XX% token vote in favor of adoption of a change resolution for it to be enacted. This is commonly denounced in the token space right now because it sets thresholds that are too high and make it hard to enact governance change. But, the flip side on the dispute case is >51% of votes in favor of the corrupt price for it to be corrupted, which is extremely secure. The hard voting thresholds have some issues:  They assume that all tokens still exist, are accessible and in circulation. They assume all tokens are held by individuals who are aware of their governance authority, obligation and have a willingness to participate. They assume that current holding of the token means a wallet is the token owner and has the right to vote with it (cough cough - exchanges) They assume that a token holder always wants the positive outcome for the ecosystem (cash and carry shorts, etc) In the event a bad actor needs to be removed from the system it creates an extremely high bar to enact.  In subjective voting thresholds we say, the majority out come of all voters who vote (usually over some small quorum threshold) decide the outcome. Most projects set that governance threshold far too low so that most of the time their day to day governance can be managed by the fractional set of users who actually become engaged. In such a governance model, you\u2019d likely want subjective threshold voting, but on a fairly high (but still accessible) minimum quorum. This should act as a model to motivate small governance itself where in disputes aren\u2019t for minor infractions or inaccuracies, but for clear malicious behavior and such the governance votes will only take place when it truly matters. #2B - Incentive Models vs Demographics Assuming that the desire is for a readable price feed, we would assume that elected producers are writing prices to the feed, paying a gas fee, and the read result is just returning the most recent price average. As we\u2019ve seen with Chainlink, this creates a set of sponsored feed providers who have some other broader ecosystem interest, such as exchanges and protocols. This is not a bad thing per se, but it does create a poorly representative interests system. If we ask ourselves \u201cCould we imagine a scenario in which the price interest of exchanges (many of whom have futures) and defi protocols (who use collateral) could diverge from the interests of users (who have open those positions) by even just a few basis points?\u201d the answer is yes. It\u2019s entirely feasible that the interests of millions of dollars could be divided by such a small amount of market movement that it would be in the interest of a few providers to under report the price within an acceptable variance bounds so that it is almost undetectable or undisputable, but still meets their needs. The penalty models of stake and slash producing, and of paying recurring gas fees make being a provider inaccessible for communities or users (whom to be fair, may lack the technical expertise to maintain an oracle provider). But it does create a lopsided interest group managing the price feed. #3 - Liveness of dispute vs Liveness of outcome and how it can still encourage corruption: As a final footnote, perhaps more for defi protocols than for the oracle itself, it raises interesting debates about a liveness/finality of oracles. In either example, where users can dispute on producers or price, we run into this interesting condition of deciding \u201cIf a bad actor influenced the price in a corrupt manner, should protocols a) ignore it, b) settle it based on the report live price that as corrupt, c) settle it based on the outcome price after the dispute\u201d The only manner I can consider in which C) is possible is if a protocol held liquidations delayed by two days, which would take on a signifgant amount of risk. So then this creates a state in which a protocol must subjectively ignore an oracle and is thus no longer centralized, or it must act on a corrupted price which will later be corrected. Imagine we have an oracle feed in which two producers open up massive shorts across collateralized assets. In turn, they both report the ETH/USD price as $1 in a block. The system doesn\u2019t view it as outliers since there is more than one report (or whatever theoretical threshold) and inturn the Ethereum price massively under reports. Being the most popular defi oracle service by a major provider, this sets off a cascading impact of liquidations and sells across the sector. Users vote to contest the price and to remove the corrupt producers. They do so in a successful manner. But, the corrupt actor still made off with their payday and users still suffered large losses. Now this is an extreme theoretically and something that is probably a similar risk model with current day oracles, but if we are talking about designing a better governance minimized oracle, then it is worth considering how that is prevented.

The UMA system has been in production for about a year now, and we\u2019ve shown that this type of oracle design really does work in real life, for real world DeFi contracts. A number of very smart folks (@g_dip, @Micah, adamscochran) have commented that the type of voting oracle Vitalik is suggesting doesn\u2019t work well with current DeFi design patterns. The biggest concern is generally around how to liquidate contracts if you have to wait for a price to get verified. UMA has spend the last ~2 years figuring this out, but we haven\u2019t done a good job communicating to the broader DeFi community how these \u201cpriceless\u201d contract designs work. What I would like to propose is that we (UMA) write a proposal for how a mature protocol like Maker or Compound could be written \u201coptimistically\u201d and be enforced with an UMA-like oracle system. This may be clarifying for this broader discussion, and help articulate the advantages of this approach. ",

The way I envision it working from vitaliks post would be:  simple uniswap oracle (twap) if someone thinks it\u2019s corrupted, you can pay a fee to dispute the result goes to a 1 day vote if that vote is still wrong (or right), someone can pay more of a dispute fee to push it to the next vote (like a 2 day vote) the next vote costs more to initiate and is longer\u2026and so on and so on eventually you have everyone in the system \u201cstaking\u201d which is the right value (which is why the cost to break is 51% of the mkt cap)  I run Tellor and we use roughly the same thing.  I think you could make the argument (like Gnosis did)\u2026why not just use a bigger mkt cap coin of ETH? The reason is that you hope a community that votes and is active in what a \u201cproper\u201d value is will be a better oracle than just allowing ETH whales (exchanges) to control the vote. Overall it never really comes down to these scenarios though.  The real \u201coracle\u201d problem is figuring out how to find the tradeoffs between speed, decentralization/liveness and slight manipulability (moving the price by 1%).  The current Uniswap twap oracle really bangs on the first 2, but sort of falls sort on the last one.  LINK rocks on 1/3 and others like Tellor find different mixes.  Handling for the long tail of preventing 51% attacks of oracle coins is a job that should be done at the user level as there are a range of appetites depending on use case for waiting weeks vs liquidating or adding penalties.

If you are prepared for the worst, then you are prepared for the best as well. Given the stakes, that\u2019s the safest way to do this. Of course, Uni\u2019s TWAP oracle has clear vulnerabilities and is just one of many attempts at solving something but missing potential threats, so it\u2019s easier said to assume these things than it is in practice. Hard to account for everything in design, which generally speaking is why most companies do NOT try to build their own version of a product where a suitable, affordable version of what they need already exists. It\u2019s very high risk to spend that many resources just to fail. Even after all the time spent on oracles for the uni team they have to go back to the drawing board completely if they want to get it right on their own, and it\u2019s another risk. When you\u2019re talking about people\u2019s money \u201cmost of the time it works\u201d is not good enough. The TWAP oracles simply are not robust enough.

And there is currently only one option, for better or for worse. I really don\u2019t get the adversity some projects have to using Chainlink, they have proven time and time again to prevent losses in case of attacks and the network has only gotten better with time. Even Maker who refused to use Chainlink now indirectly uses Chainlink because all of their feed providers do. Compound is adopting Chainlink in conjunction with Uni\u2019s oracle (Uni\u2019s oracle not needed but another case of ego where Compound\u2019s founder simply can\u2019t admit that Chainlink got it right where they could not on their own). Uni is the last bastion of DeFi that is fighting Chainlink. For what? Going to kill the network. I\u2019m not saying that there shouldn\u2019t be alternatives, I\u2019m all for that. But developing a robust, useful oracle system is not an overnight task. It\u2019s not a 1 month task. it\u2019s not a 1 quarter or 1 year task. It will take all of Uni\u2019s dev resources multiple years to do this properly. In what world would that be the right decision unless they wanted to fully pivot? ",

                    "content": "    vbuterin:   Stablecoins need an oracle for the price of ETH/USD (see above) Workarounds like taking the ETH/USDC price are NOT sufficient    I have an FX multi-bank trading platform background and for me \u201cOracle problem\u201d is very similar to a price-fixing problem on FX market. (ex. google: \u201cGlobal banks admit guilt in forex probe, fined nearly $6 billion\u201d) The solution for FX was to move away from fixings as price Oracles, where there might be some particular interests that can be in billion of $$$, and focus more on the tradeable price. Even if $10 billion would be at stake to get 50%+1 on price Oracle, we are never sure, if the interest is not bigger than $10 billion (imagine Crypto Market Cap of $100 trillion). This brings me to a basic question: how to create better link between the value of ERC-20 token and the value of USD/EUR/GBP/JPY/\u2026 to get more people using smart contracts in the real economy? From my perspective, the real race to bring more trust to a stable coin market is not a race between price Oracles (we learned from FX that they are vulnerable by its nature), but how to make Tether-like projects (ERC-20 to FIAT \u201cbridges\u201d) big enough to compete with CLS settlement system. If we will get the settlement right (from ERC-20 to FIAT), the instrument price will always follow. Arbitrage will do the rest even if the price of all tokens would drop 99% in 1 minute. This would not be the case for price Oracles. Currently, CLS is big enough to get the trust of $2 trillion per day (google: \u201cCLS FX TRADING ACTIVITY march 2021\u201d), if Tether-like solutions will get closer to CLS, the interbank market will follow and then a Crypto Market Cap of $100 trillion will become possible. CLS has achieved scale in fully CENTRALIZED way. Our job is to do it in a fully DECENTRALIZED way. To fully integrate ERC-20 with FIAT we can copy one popular pattern from FIAT: It is common to see wealthy people putting money in 50-100 banks to get credit risk distributed (done usually by family office). It is not possible to avoid counterparty risk in FIAT, but government deposits insurance of $100k-250k for each individual bank is at least addressing some part of the risk. Having it in different jurisdictions is reducing the risk even more. Let\u2019s try to replicate this on blockchain:  Every regulated crypto broker/crypto bank that has access to FIAT system should issue its own stable coins in all supported currencies. The stable coin would represent a deposit with this particular broker/bank. Each broker/bank could have its own rules on how deposit works (ex. if this would be a bank, it would be probably willing to use this FIAT money for its own lending activity, the same way as in case of regular FIAT deposit) The only function of the broker/bank would be to redeem their stable coins for FIAT (they don\u2019t need to make markets \u2192 this will be done by market participants) This would result in 200-300 stable coins in all possible currencies issued by different brokers/banks Stable Coin Baskets would be created via smart contracts (ETF like products with stable coin basket redemption to allow arbitrage via FIAT settlement) Stable Coin Baskets would compete with each other for the best basket of stable coins/best smart contract structure/best governance Even if one or the other stable coin issuer will stop redeeming its own stable coins for one or the other reason the whole system should survive. Each Stable Coin Basket/Basket of Baskets can have its own protocol fees and Treasury that would compancate when some coin in the basket would become \u201cinsolvent\u201d (= not convertable to FIAT).  Our first task: make it very simple for regulated crypto brokers/crypto banks to issue their own stable coins ",

Projects specializing in building a specific piece of composable smart contract infrastructure is the beauty of the DeFi stack, it leads to efficient usage of limited developer resources. To note, the Chainlink Network is already cryptoeconomically secured by the $46B FDV LINK token through implicit incentives (oracle nodes are paid in and hold native tokens whose value is derived from the health of the network as a whole). This form of cryptoeconomic security is already seen with the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks today (miners hold and are paid in native coins) and is why the honest majority assumption works, it\u2019s backed by economic incentives and penalties. Additional cryptoeconomic security through explicit staking (the slashing of deposited stake from malicious nodes) is being worked on and will be implemented with Chainlink 2.0, discussed in the recent whitepaper. These approaches raise the cost of attack, which is why I believe Chainlink Price Feeds are already well suited for securing high-value DeFi smart contracts like Aave, Synthetix, and algorithmic stablecoins like Reflexer, Ampleforth, etc. twitter[dot]com/ChainLinkGod/status/1392965710976978950 ",

Remember this one time where a node operator by accident swapped the gold price feed with that of silver. Some users on synthetix profited hugely from this, while the nodes still had their LINK payouts (no penalties applied). Point is that a node can serve just about any data no matter the quality. There is no mechanism to judge on whether this data is correct and penalize accordingly. Probably this is what Vitalik meant with \u2018incentives are not clear\u2019. ",

                    "content": "    jekkos:  So how does chainlink implement this cryptoeconomic security?   I can expand upon Chainlink\u2019s cryptoeconomic security for clarity. Chainlink oracle networks are cryptoeconomically secured today through implicit incentives. Each Chainlink node in the network holds and is paid in LINK tokens for their oracle services. The value of LINK itself is derived from the health, adoption, and reputation of the network as a whole, creating a strong economic incentive for each node to provide a secure and reliable source of external data (e.g. ETH/USD) in order to uphold the value of not only their current LINK holdings but also their future revenue (which is denominated in LINK). We see implicit incentives in existing networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Because Ethereum miners hold and are paid in ETH, they operate the protocol faithfully because a corrupted network would result in the devaluation of ETH due to the destroyed trust of the network, creating financial harm to themselves. In the Chainlink Network, a successful collusion attack between the most reputable and profitable nodes that ends up results in a significant loss/exploits for DeFi protocols would likewise destroy trust in the network, resulting in a devaluation of the value of LINK. In addition, each individual Chainlink node is a publicly identifiable entity with their individual future revenue, reputation, and off-chain business on the line. Chainlink nodes operated by enterprises like Deutsche Telekom and data providers like Kaiko have significant revenue both within and outside of the Chainlink network, which would be forfeited through malicious activity. Therefore, for economically rational nodes, it is more profitable to be honest, which is why the honest majority assumption works for networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink, etc. What you noted about the gold price feed from a year ago wasn\u2019t an attack on the network but a misconfiguration of a single feed that resulted in minimal issues. If tens of billions of dollars had been stolen as a result, the value of LINK would have certainly been significantly affected here, creating a financial penalty. The devaluation of the native token depends on the severity of the network issue/attack. The Chainlink network has been significantly hardened since then and uses an entirely different oracle network model, so such issues have not occurred since, but the security of the Chainlink network is not static and continues to evolve. The Chainlink 2.0 whitepaper was recently published which modeled an explicit staking mechanism where nodes stake their LINK tokens in a service agreement and can be slashed for providing manipulated data. Here, a two-tier oracle network model is used, with a low-cost first-tier that continuously generates oracle reports and a higher-cost maximum-security second tier used for settling disputes, which creates a super-linear staking impact where the cost of attack is significantly greater (quadratic in the number of first-tier nodes) than the sum of all deposits within that network. The first-tier consists of nodes explicitly staking LINK while the second-tier consists of the most reputable, reliable, and profitable nodes in the Chainlink network who have the greatest financial exposure to LINK and as rational economic actors resolve the rare disputes accurately in order to uphold the value of their LINK holdings, LINK staked in other first-tier networks, future LINK revenue, and individual reputation. The whitepaper goes much deeper into this mechanism than I can cover here, but this mechanism would provide slashing-based cryptoeconomic security in addition to the existing implicit incentives-based cryptoeconomic security. research.chain[dot]link/whitepaper-v2.pdf ",

Optimisms business model is to Auction off MEV. Every single block on Optimism will need to have near optimal MEV extraction for this to be economical. This presents a problem when we think about oracles. If you are the block sequencer on Optimism, where will you put the oracle update transactions? Where ever they are most pro?table for you. And in extreme cases you can actually censor them. Yes I know some Optimism fag will tell you how they added some feature to prevent censorship, but without disclosing specifics I am categorically telling you they cannot promise true censorship resistance on Optimism in it\u2019s current design. This is a huge problem for oracles obviously. The reason for the high-latency nature of Vitalik\u2019s oracle is to make the oracle update window span far enough into the future that the MEV aspect happens less frequently. How ever, whichever lucky sequencer manages to catch the occasional oracle update gets a nearly guaranteed fat arbitrage, as it has been hours or potentially days since the last oracle update, so the arbs will be fucking huge. The fatass giga arb is what will incentivize the sequencers to actually include the oracle update in the block. Othenlvise they would just keep trading on grossly mispriced assets. This setup provides nearly guaranteed MEV against protoools which use oracles. Optimism needs MEV to fuel their revenue. If this kind of design was not used, the MEV could potentially dry up as protocols get smarter at designing around MEV and actually giving a shit about their users. This is a bit of a dirty secret, but idgaf. The truth will set us free.  ",

                    "content": "Using a native token for oracle networks maximizes security and long term sustainability in the form of implicit incentives and network subsidies. As noted before, oracles holding and getting paid in a token whose value is derived directly from the health of that oracle network provides greater security as nodes operators are more financially exposed to the health of that network, aligning incentives. Using ETH doesn\u2019t provide this dynamic as its value comes from the health and adoption of the Ethereum network, not any specific oracle network. Additionally, a native token provides subsidies (like a block reward) which is used to not only bootstrap new oracle networks, but also provide oracles a higher revenue (creating a higher opportunity cost of malicious activity as they could lose this income) and lower costs for users as they don\u2019t have to pay the full costs, increasing usage of that oracle solution. This is why we have not seen any oracle solution operate at scale without a native token. This dynamic applies to both Chainlink and this proposal. ",

                    "content": "I am the original conceiver and designer of Augurs oracle system. Wanted to add some information not in this thread yet. \u2013 Augur security margin (assuming it is still designed the same) comes from the universe forking where the oracle service is frozen while the two versions of REP compete for market cap. The one with the higher market cap at the end of the competition gets control of the existing markets. This requires an attacker to not just have n/2 of the market cap, but to have enough to inflate a worthless crypto at a price for an extended period of time. I forget some specifics, but assuming all holders of the fake REP sell (as is rational to do) at slightly above full market value of the real REP (as is required for the attacker to win), the cost of attack in actually n. Its possible to extend this into an infinite security margin by having multiple rounds where the attacker must double the amount of money honest holders have each time. This infinite security margin comes at the cost of arbitrary long amount of time to freeze the oracle services. \u2013 Chainlink V2 has serious security margin issues as laid out in the V2 whitepaper. It seemed suspicious when I skimmed the paper originally, but it was not until a writeup made the week in ethereum news making a convincing case that a second tier does not help at all with the security and it is not actually n^2.  That said, I am completely confident Chainlink will resolve this design issue. After all, they had to make it in secret with NDAs and a bit too many non crypto university professors. Now that they are able to get wider community input I am confident Chainlink v2 will be a quality product with many capabilities. Makes me wonder though if Chainlink V2s multi hundred page paper with huge ambitions and complexity as well as security margin issue was why Vitalik chose to make this plea to Uniswap instead. He probably just wanted a high market cap erc20 that was not Chainlink to make the request to since a high market cap is a prerequisite to a secure oracle. \u2013 Augurs model can be sped up close to real time if the data at hand is simply a price number because it doesnt require human interpretation. A node can be coded to just automatically contest and stake against incorrect prices with a single block delay, doubling until a fork. Because it can be automated it wont be as slow as Vitalik and others in this thread are assuming. It would even be fast enough (1 block delay almost always) for liquidation, although someone can delay the price update a few blocks in a row by frivolous contesting. This frivolous delay would probably not be able to be more than several blocks though because of the bond doubling each time. Another catch is that all services relying on this oracle would have to be able to gracefully handle the price feed being delayed, or potentially frozen for a long time if a fork happens. \u2013 I agree with the general sentiment that this is orthogonal to Uniswap raison d\u2019\u00eatre. While it would add value to the UNI token, it is a pretty serious \u2018side project\u2019 to do an upgrade that includes UNI tokens splitting in a fork. It may also for security add requirements for UNI token holders to take action in the event of a major contentious event. It may also be a waste of resources if Chainlink delivers a high security margin solution with the ability to contest and lose increasingly staked amounts. I expect that a sped up and automated version of Augur oracle but for price feeds that typically resolves in a single block will eventually exist, and Chainlink will probably take it. Still if Uniswap governance has a huge amount of money to throw around, this has a chance of adding value to the UNI token, and perhaps this is worth doing, but really think they probably have better value propositions.

I don\u2019t think it is just a question of throwing money around to value UNI. The issue is about decentralization.  Having an independent Oracle by the largest DEX entity in the world (by daily volume) seems logical. As Andreas, Vitalik and others have pointed out and as evidenced (for example; in Compound DAI liquidation Oracle event in Dec 2020): Multi Oracle systems are required to mitigate single-points-of-failure issues with respect to data ingest feed evaluations. Prediction Market tech have the potential of becoming the next big thing to blockchain and it seems only natural to build an oracle on UNI since it is the leading DEX/DEFI token. It would be really great if you could help us with the proposal to complement Augurs oracle system. ",

Jack did not participate in the system design (cant remember if literally zero or a little bit\u2026he was following along closely).

Holders of the token are asked what the price is, and typically an economic mechanism is introduced where those who provide the majority answer are rewarded and those who provide the minority answer are penalized.   What about a \u201cvirtual token\u201d of fixed amount (say, 1 billion or trillion TOKENS or whatever makes sense)  that\u2019s bound by a smart contract to the value of all the liquidity pools. The pool value can be calculated in any currency available on the exchange. ETH makes sense as the largest currency on the network, but any stablecoin could be good too. Then the price is a simple $POOL_VALUE/TOKEN_QTY and the total pool value is the token\u2019s market cap. The token should not be tradable, only used as price reference within the protocol the liquidity pools exist in. Additionally this could allow new features, like providing liquidity against multiple tokens with single asset with the \u201cvirtual token\u201d serving as an intermediary in calculating the exchange rate. If it\u2019s not obvious by now, I\u2019m very new to the crypto market, so disregard if this makes no sense.

                    "content": "Great to see discussion resurected around this topic. Looks like a few things are still needed to figure out:  8/ It\u2019s worth considering a fee to use Uniswap oracles. While this would require some protocol changes, this could be implemented as a flat fee in ETH per call or a registration of a project\u2019s contract on an array of approved oracle callers.  What would the complexity be of this type of protocol change, and does it require extensive testing/auditing? Also need to figure what defines Uniswap as a \u201ckeeper of oracles\u201d per the tweet thread:  (1) act as a \u201cliquidity provider of last resort\u201d By \u201cliquidity provider of last resort,\u201d I mean the DAO could create an automated strategy or appoint an LP manager to provide passive liquidity to pools that are important oracles and running low on liquidity. (2) provide liquidity incentives to pools that are high value as price oracles (3) provide data and research regarding oracle performance (4) provide better documentation for best practices around oracle usage  It looks a \u201cKeeper of Oracles\u201d would function well if it did all four of these tasks. One of the best way\u2019s for user\u2019s to learn about Oracles is to actually use it for projects, and to have documention surrounding the process of usage. I wonder if Point (1) and (2) could be related somehow. Such as providing longer period vested incentives, that are locked up as insurance incase point (1) happens during x amount of time. i.e. Incentive long period lock up, that pays out if oracle is successful, but accured potential payout is slashed if failing. The latency of large and short time frames of the oracle could partically be mitigated by healthy liquidity depth around spot, so perhaps an active liquidity manager could be involved in this strategy. Great to see this proposal have some fresh eyes and perspective from Alex Kroeger. Helps me see the potential. ",
