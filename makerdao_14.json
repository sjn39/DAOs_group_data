Congrats to @planet_x and @paperimperium for topping the leaderboard!! We\u2019ve got a group DM to hash out some of the nuanced topics around delegation and support each other. The most pressing topic, and probably obvious one, is the amount of time it takes to be informed and vote. What seems clear is: voting takes a 10-20 hour weekly commitment to stay on top of what matters and properly diligence all the proposals, threads, groups, core units, and changes. The subtlety here is that it\u2019s possible to spend almost a full-time commitment on the maker protocol catching some of the blind spots that Core Units and proposals need. As we can see, Paper and Planet\u2019s diligence has translated into a significant stake of MKR delegated, but that can change on a transaction. From what we can tell, compensating delegates in a fair matter, assuming community consensus, will both attract new ones and retain the top delegate\u2019s performance. We\u2019re hoping for the number of delegates with a significant stake in the system to be around 10. More happy delegates mean better security, improved ideas, better quality assurance on proposals, and generally better discussion and participation. Plus, I mean, just think of the Voltron memes\u2026. Yet, we wanted to poll the community to collate the right information before moving to a formal signal request. We welcome a conversation about compensation, but if we start to go off-topic, as we\u2019re wanton to do, I\u2019ll try to start new threads as they arise. As with all informal polls, this is a conversation starter to hash out details. We\u2019re thrilled to get this topic going.  Questions Is it reasonable to expect a time commitment between 10-20 hours a week from a delegate?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Should delegates be compensated for this time?     Yes No     0 voters     Suggested delegate pay for a months work:     7k DAI 8k DAI 9k DAI Other ( please respond with suggestion)     0 voters     Should compensation only be for the top 10 delegates with high stake, high vote performance, and high vote communication?     Yes No Other (please suggest ideal number of compensated delegates)     0 voters     ",

MIP49: Staking Rewards would have entitled MKR holders to Dai payments based on how much MKR they staked in the voting contract. However when polled, it was voted down (15.87% for, 84.12% against). How is paying a delegate for voting participation fundamentally different? Let\u2019s look at it another way.  Say MKR holder 0xabcd holds 8000 MKR and votes regularly.  Her interests are aligned with MakerDAO because she has significant MKR exposure, but she is not paid to vote.  Should the act of creating a vote delegation contract and depositing her 8000 MKR entitle her to 8k Dai monthly income from the protocol? 2 Delegates are already compensated in the form of voting power. Normally, if one wanted to increase their voting power they need to buy or borrow MKR, which has a cost.  Delegates get increased voting power for free. 3 Delegates are likely to have a lot of power over the protocol. Already the top 3 delegates are not far from having enough MKR to pass an executive vote.  Voting on their own pay could be, or at least be seen as a conflict of interest. 4 If anyone, shouldn\u2019t it be those delegating MKR who pay their delegate for the service of voting for them? A mechanism to do this could be build into a future iteration of the delegate contract.  For example, a continuous 5 basis point fee could be charged on delegated MKR. This avoids MKR holders who already do their own research and pay their own gas needing to additionally subsidize multiple delegates who are not directly serving them. 5 A committed, skin in the game MKR holder who already researches, forms opinions, and votes doesn\u2019t really need to do much, if any more work when others agree with their point of view and track record and choose to delegate to them.  They are already spending the necessary time and gas funds. ",

Well, I would compensate proportional a formula that I suggest above. But yes, I think it is interesting to put recognized delegates into a competition to guide the DAO as wisely as possible.     Spidomo:  Delegates are already compensated in the form of voting power.   It still costs gas to vote.     Spidomo:  Delegates get increased voting power for free.   No way. They have to earn that trust. To earn that trust, they have to work hard understanding all the details of what is going on in the project.     Spidomo:  Voting on their own pay could be, or at least be seen as a conflict of interest.   MKR holders still retain the ultimate say. If a delegate votes against the interest of the most MKR holders then they will find themselves with much less MKR delegated to them as soon as word gets around.     Spidomo:  shouldn\u2019t it be those delegating MKR who pay their delegate for the service of voting for them?   But everybody benefits from wise discussion, not just the holders of the MKR that is delegated.

Going back to:     Spidomo:  The idea of the protocol rewarding (paying) for voting participation has been considered before and rejected.   I think one of the main reasons for the rejection, at that time, was indeed the lack of delegation. Perhaps it is time to re-discuss MKR voters compensation?

Maybe I\u2019m in the minority, but I did not assume that being a delegate would be a compensated position (outside of a subsidy to cover gas fees) in the DAO. I would assume that any delegates themselves are sizeable MKR holders and I would think the voting influence from being a delegate with the equity stake would be plenty of financial motivation. I\u2019ve re-read this proposal three times and still have more questions than answers.  What qualifies a delegate to be compensated? Minimum MKR delegated? Voting frequency? Why do delegates need to be paid $100-$200 an hour (nearly $1M/year for 10 delegates) to do something that was already being done for free up until this point? Will delegates be abstaining from voting in this poll and from on chain voting if this proposal makes it on chain? If this passes, is there then a disincentive for someone to delegate their MKR and we could end up with less delegated MKR? For example, if the minimum threshold for delegate compensation is set to 10K MKR, and as a voter I could push them over the edge to get compensated, I would be disincentivized from doing that as it would take money out of the DAO\u2019s pockets. How is compensating the delegates different than the DAO\u2019s decision to vote down MIP49 (Staking rewards) which would\u2019ve distributed rewards more equitably? Active delegates are already being compensated for engaging on the forum through Sourcecred and top contributors are earning $2-3K a month. There was also a recent poll to increase these payments which the majority were in favor of.  With a number of CUs in the pipeline and CU expenses ramping up, I\u2019m not sure how to justify spending 4.2% of the DAO\u2019s annual cash flow run rate on something that was free and supposed to be making a process (voting on chain) easier and more efficient. To put this in numbers, if I assumed that a delegate spent the minimum amount of hours in the stated range (10), they would become the highest salaried position in the DAO (effectively a $384K/yr salary). I hate to be the bad guy here, but as part of the RWF CU I feel it is my obligation to look after the bottom line. ",

I do think it would be appropriate to remove compensated delegates from SourceCred. That\u2019s an easy one \u2014 delegates could choose one or the other.   I typically spend around 2 hours/day on the forums. Beyond that, I engage in extensive off-forum work in other areas at least equal to that, though the mileage on that will vary by delegate and their particular skill sets.   Most delegates are not independently wealthy. If a delegate is clearly uninformed about some basic DAO matter and they\u2019re a volunteer, it\u2019s hard to complain. Alternatively, an hour of serious DAO business \u2014 especially the kind not reflected in SourceCred\u2014 has to come from some other use of that delegate\u2019s time. Most likely this is familial duties or paying work.   Headhunting is real. Other stablecoins, DeFi projects, and financial firms are paying attention to us here. I can personally attest to being regularly hit with communications from start ups, other protocols, and the like. To date, the only one I\u2019ve accepted or seriously considered is to teach a college course, but there are offers to \u201cmatch or exceed\u201d large companies that are not us (they know there is nothing to match here).   I am here at Maker for the long haul, but if my wife ever saw some of the things in my inbox on top of the fact that I tabled a proposed CU with a good salary in order to pursue delegation? Yikes on bikes. I can only imagine other delegates will come under similar pressures.  Bribery is being openly integrated into protocols. I don\u2019t think anyone on the current slate would sell a vote for a few thousand dollars, but let\u2019s not assume someone 2 years from now would feel the same.  I don\u2019t know what the right cutoffs are for pay or inclusion, but especially since it is DAI and not MKR being asked for, I think some level of compensation is required. Number 4 is the one that I would stress the most from the above list, since that hits at how much delegate churn we could be exposed to, which would defeat the point of delegation. ETA: 6) We need to lure in more delegates, even if it is simply to have a \u201c2nd string\u201d who can quickly fill gaps because they already understand most corners of the DAO. It would be nice to convert a couple shadow delegates to recognized as well. But this is simply smart succession planning to have a few folks who are already \u201chalfway there\u201d even if they are not brokering mergers or overseeing political outreach or anything else.

Cost vs benefits     Aes:  I hate to be the bad guy here, but as part of the RWF CU I feel it is my obligation to look after the bottom line.   I empathize with this opinion greatly. You\u2019re not the bad guy at all!! It\u2019s super helpful to frame things in terms of costs/ benefits.  Voting on Compensation     Aes:   Will delegates be abstaining from voting in this poll and from on chain voting if this proposal makes it on chain?    I will. I would advise that we all do and rally other MKR voters to pass it.     Spidomo:  Delegates are likely to have a lot of power over the protocol. Already the top 3 delegates are not far from having enough MKR to pass an executive vote. Voting on their own pay could be, or at least be seen as a conflict of interest.   This was a primary concern, and it\u2019s why I began this conversation as an informal poll. So we can start to narrow down on the conflicts and best approaches.   MIP 49 rejected     Spidomo:  The idea of the protocol rewarding (paying) for voting participation has been considered before and rejected.       Aes:   How is compensating the delegates different than the DAO\u2019s decision to vote down MIP49 (Staking rewards) which would\u2019ve distributed rewards more equitably?    I think MIP49 could be re-introduced? If a MIP is rejected it can be proposed again, it\u2019s not like rejection once equals rejection forever. There is a powerful combination there for voting we can explore.  \u201cpeople already vote, right? why pay?\u201d     Spidomo:  A committed, skin in the game MKR holder who already researches, forms opinions, and votes doesn\u2019t really need to do much, if any more work when others agree with their point of view and track record and choose to delegate to them. They are already spending the necessary time and gas funds.       Aes:  With a number of CUs in the pipeline and CU expenses ramping up, I\u2019m not sure how to justify spending 4.2% of the DAO\u2019s annual cash flow run rate on something that was free and supposed to be making a process (voting on chain) easier and more efficient.   If it was free\u2026 was it working? It probably would have been better to say incentivized delegates = passing executives faster, easier, and more secure instead of implying that under \u201cbetter security.\u201d     twblack88:  More happy delegates mean better security, improved ideas, better quality assurance on proposals, and generally better discussion and participation.     What is delegation responsibility anyway?     iammeeoh:  Who defined these tasks? Are these activities formally enforced/checked? I don\u2019t think so.   I\u2019ll drop this right here for you, Meeoh, especially number 7      Recognised Delegate Requirements Delegates   1. Inform a Governance Facilitator of your intention to become a recognized delegate. Speak to either @LongForWisdom or @prose11 - best way to get in contact is via the official MakerDAO chat or the official MakerDAO forum. Please don\u2019t use email.   2. Read and sign-up to the Delegates Code of Conduct. The canonical Code of Conduct is located here. Sign-up can be as fancy or not-fancy as you like. Some options include:   Signing a message on-chain. Confirming that you\u2019ve read and agree to it wi\u2026         iammeeoh:  My point is: each delegate acts as they want and within their time/energy/intellectual resources. We should not fix rigid behaviors.   This is well said, and It\u2019s why I think @psychonaut is really on track with thinking through an active & flexible formula for delegation, and then we can vote and possibly encode it ( combining this a bit with @Spidomo thoughts about the delegation contract)   Y\u2019all are already whales, right?     Aes:  I would assume that any delegates themselves are sizeable MKR holders. I would think the voting influence from being a delegate with the equity stake would be plenty of financial motivation.   I\u2019ll be tactful here and say I would never assume. I personally am not a size-able holder in any regard for reasons I would prefer to be diplomatic about. Paper summed this up quite well as \u201cmost delegates are not independently wealthy.\u201d I am also committed to seeing this experiment through; I think we can have a really healthy voting ecosystem in a year.

                    "content": "@aes I\u2019m not certain if I have all the right answers are to your questions, but this how I\u2019m thinking about it: 1.\tWhat qualifies a delegate to be compensated? Minimum MKR delegated? Voting frequency? In my opinion, it should be based on Voting Frequency, Participation ( active communication via Meetings, Maker Forum, Rocket Chat, etc.),  Active Users that understand the protocol and want it to flourish, but lack sufficient tokens to participate in a serious manner. Active Users that have shown a commitment to MakerDAO, and yes, a history of engagement and community participation.  But I also believe some of my fellow Delegatee have a fair view/opinion of such. 2.\tWhy do delegates need to be paid $100-$200 an hour (nearly $1M/year for 10 delegates) to do something that was already being done for free up until this point? Personally, I spend over 40++ hours engaging in anything and everything related to MakerDAO\u2013so, I doubt I\u2019ll ever spend below 40 hours in this Maker land. For me, my passion is my full-time job. In order to make enough $DAI to live in New York City, I also have to be active in generating investment income (trading, leveraging, and yes, farming/LP mining). Since I took on the roll of becoming a Delegate, my personal earnings have stagnated because I believe I need to be involved and concentrate 100% more on everything related to this protocol. I also believe it is my responsibility to educate myself beyond MakerDAO and Ethereum, therefore I spend another 10-20 hours learning about other DeFi protocols, learning about the magic behind Layer 2s, upcoming regulations, reading about our competitors, and researching how MakerDAO can benefit from the incoming cross-chain metaverse. 3.\tWill delegates be abstaining from voting in this poll and from on chain voting if this proposal makes it on chain? From conversations we have had with @GovAlpha we as Delegates will be able to Vote on such\u2013however, IMO there is enough MKR token holders out there to Vote \u201cNo\u201d. I can tell you from my own personal view\u2014I will continue to be a Delegate, compensation, or no compensation. I am committed. 4.\tIf this passes, is there then a disincentive for someone to delegate their MKR and we could end up with less delegated MKR? For example, if the minimum threshold for delegate compensation is set to 10K MKR, and as a voter I could push them over the edge to get compensated, I would be disincentivized from doing that as it would take money out of the DAO\u2019s pockets. For sure\u2014IMO we need to be careful on how we set the barrier to entry\u2014should a Delegate with 10-100 delegated MKR who has shown commitment to the protocol, expertise in finance, history of engagement, proven long-term alignment with the protocol\u2019s success, proven to have a diversify opinion of the success of the protocol not be compensated? 5. How is compensating the delegates different than the DAO\u2019s decision to vote down MIP49 (Staking rewards) which would\u2019ve distributed rewards more equitably? This is a good quick read on why many in the community felt MIP49 would not incentivize MKR token holders to Vote: Paradigm 6. Active delegates are already being compensated for engaging on the forum through Sourcecred and top contributors are earning $2-3K a month. There was also a recent poll to increase these payments which the majority were in favor of. Personally, as much as I have participated in this said Forum, I have never made more than 1,400 DAI/month. Since becoming  a Recognized Delegate (Flip Flop Flap Delegate) I have relentlessly made sure I read every post, voiced my opinion, drilled down on subjects I need to educate myself on ( RWA legal structures, optimistic rollups/ZK rollups,  etc.) so, I believe this month I might join that Team   but to be honest, embarrassingly\u2014I  have no idea how source cred actually works. I\u2019m here because I eat, sleep, and dream MakerDAO\u2013plus this is my passion  And last but not least, this here  is      PaperImperium:  Headhunting is real.

                    "content": "Thanks for starting this conversation. I think it\u2019s an important one that will define how we expect the DAO to function for years to come. I think there is the notion that delegates will essentially be doing the equivalent of a full-time job. This should absolutely not be the case. If it were true that delegates were spending that many hours to examine the arguments for and against every proposal or exec, it means that informed voting is virtually impossible for everyone else. Direct democracy is not new and it is possible to summarize complex issues to allow people to grasp the essentials on both sides of a given issue fairly quickly. Our proposals and execs need to remain readable and digestible for everyone and should not require anywhere near this amount of time to understand. Delegates can and should be more informed than the average voter and should be compensated for that.     iammeeoh:  Perhaps it is time to re-discuss MKR voters compensation? (Which, implicitly, will include delegates compensation?)   Delegates should be able to take a cut from that based on how much MKR was delegated to them. Obviously, gas costs, time spent on the initial work to set up the delegate platform and other incidental items should be covered. Finally, active delegates on the Forum do receive significant SourceCred payments and deservedly so. At the end of the day, delegation should be a nice-to-have feature but not an essential feature. It should not make the average member of the DAO unable to participate in governance due to information overload. I strongly disagree with this proposal because it takes a step towards making governance participation inaccessible to nearly everyone. ",

That said, on review of the previous forum threads discussing delegation I am struggling to see any mention of compensation for the work being undertaken, if this has been discussed previously then I am happy to be directed to it - this was probably an oversight at that time and should have been openly discussed prior to the system going live. Ultimately, I suspect the answer to this would be somewhere in the middle. Possibly, with a re-emergence of governance rewards with some of the rewards of the delegator being passed to the delegate as \u201cpayment\u201d - I know @Prose11 worked on this a lot previously.

If it were true that delegates were spending that many hours to examine the arguments for and against every proposal or exec, it means that informed voting is virtually impossible for everyone else.   I know that for myself to literally be informed on everything going on in this system would be more than a full time job.   There are a lot of things I leave to others.   I honestly would love to see time logs from people.   I keep my own and they tend to be rather significant compared to what I would like.  This is because I tend to think about minimum changes to achieve longer term goals and to try to do relevant research to not just provide a reasoned but informed response.  In the loosest send trying to help CUs improve with relevant suggestions for long term change to achieve stated goals is probably the harder work anyone does here. In my own view anyone being an informed MKR voter really needs to dedicate a lot of time.   I mean is it sufficient to just say no or yes to anything and not give a reason.?   Even CUs don\u2019t need to know what other CUs are doing not to the extent of a MKR holder trying to manage the system they only need to focus on what they need to do their specific job\u2026   Given many Maker workers are MKR holders they probably do. I am abstaining from this poll as a delegate even though as  MKR holder I actually would vote NO to compensation as the delegate system is currently constructed.    The primary reason is that delegates \u2018self elect\u2019 and basically as pointed out here by @Spidomo     Spidomo:  Let\u2019s look at it another way. Say MKR holder 0xabcd holds 8000 MKR and votes regularly. Her interests are aligned with MakerDAO because she has significant MKR exposure, but she is not paid to vote. Should the act of creating a vote delegation contract and depositing her 8000 MKR entitle her to 8k Dai monthly income from the protocol?   Large MKR holders basically can self delegate and hence self elect.    While a very large holder can do this no matter how the system is constructed I think with some moderate changes we can mitigate this. I have a forum post waiting for approval on suggested delegate system changes that could address many of the issues discussed above. As the system stands now, and as a delegate I would vote NO to any delegate compensation, the reason for this is I believe as constructed since delegates can self elect there is a significant potential for abuse. With some delegate system modifications I am a YES to delegate compensation. As a delegate with conflict of interest who wants to hear from the community I voted to \u2018Abstain\u2019. I am also open to continuing the discussion on various approaches to compensating delegates as well as changes to the delegate system to potentially improve it.   One could argue this system just started so ideas of change are rushing the gun, but we have a system barely started and people want to change it dramatically by adding compensation in some way.   As a new system undergoing significant change perhaps we can be open to other changes to improve it as well. ",

However, I feel some contradiction here, since Sourcecred involves a lot of official Maker employees, so if I understand correctly, they are rewarded by the system while they are far from being tier2 contributors.   How does this work?   Going back to the original question, I think the other solution could be compensation weighted by the number of MKRs voted, but this has been voted down by some whales before.  Also, your table shows that some delegates have more than 100x the amount of MKRs delegated than others, and I don\u2019t think that reflects the difference in skill or knowledge of each delegate. I think this difference is more likely to come from relationship capital, and I don\u2019t see how this gives the Maker any advantage, any extra performance that is worth paying for.   As for compensation like salary: the delegate is an interesting position, because as I understand it they are not Maker employees, so they are not subject to the same rules. (For example, a delegate can vote for the short term interest of the whale he represents against the medium/long term interest of the system and this is not incompatible. A Maker employee cannot do this freely without consequences. ) I don\u2019t know how this can be resolved.   ",

I updated Delegate reward proposal - Google Sheets to include a parameter for the minimum number of delegates. This caps the compensation of delegates, even if they receive overwhelming support in terms of delegated MKR. I also switched the exponent to 0.5 because I think GovAlpha can probably do a good job preventing a sybil attack of small MKR weight delegates. ",

As for this point, I\u2019d say that other Maker employees have a primary job of doing something besides communicate on the forums and vote. So I don\u2019t feel the contradiction. For example, we want SourceCred to incentivize a member of the Oracle team to communicate on the forums. However, if a delegate is already getting rewarded for communicating on the forums and voting through a separate mechanism then it seems to me that SourceCred earnings would be redundant. We\u2019d be paying a delegate twice for the same work. ",

I think part of a delegate\u2019s job is to offer a strategic vision and direction for Maker, too. Maker badly needs focus, and having a menu of options to travel between for that is a large part of what delegates are for. I cannot speak for others, but I am not pitching my personal judgement as the reason to delegate MKR to me. I am pitching a vision of Maker integrating with the real world economy as a means of scaling to profitability and delivering upon its social mission. That doesn\u2019t mean passively waiting for @prose11 to nudge us that there is an executive that needs to pass (which the most recent passed within hours of significant MKR delegation). Any VC can read an executive or poll and vote on it 5 minutes later. Delegates should be active thought leaders in the MakerDAO community. And MKR holders should judge them upon both the direction and the results. Otherwise, we\u2019re all just running around like chickens with our heads cut off. We don\u2019t have full-time legal, marketing, or compliance professionals working directly for the DAO. Think about that for a moment. Tiny startups have former SEC chairs or CFTC commissioners and law firms on retainer and marketing/lobbying budgets. We are the emperor that has no clothes and we don\u2019t have a lot of time to correct that before someone notices. We need high-level partnerships or we\u2019re not going to make it. Our window of opportunity is closing, and if we aren\u2019t working our delegates like dogs to get us where we won\u2019t be picked apart by some government agency or stablecoin competitor, we have made a huge mistake. We\u2019re whistling past the graveyard here. Delegates aren\u2019t just here to make sure it doesn\u2019t take 3 weeks to distribute CU budgets. If all they did was click \u201cvote\u201d on vote.makerdao.com then they shouldn\u2019t be paid. Delegates aren\u2019t supposed to be executives. But they are supposed to make sure the protocol doesn\u2019t just sit in place and wait to be outcompeted. Perhaps that\u2019s my own read, and naturally my view will be biased on this topic. Delegates are supposed to do much more than just mash a \u201cvote\u201d button to pass an executive. ",

I think delegates could be ideally suited to this. Honestly though I see these as pretty complex issues and while I could see a kind of delegate CU forming to address and distribute some of this.   Based on my own first look at the \u2018state of MKR\u2019 and you will see my comments on this in the future when I look at distribution of MKR both in holder wallets and within govenrance the real issues stand out dramatically. This whole delegate thing while will bring about some change isn\u2019t really going to address the core issues revoloving around MKR distribution gini being pretty bloody horrible. Case in point because I have this now. Top 100 wallets (excluding AAVE, and 84K MKR) have 80% all MKR next 400 wallets 15.6% last 39,500 < 5% Really think about this when considering governance. Also if you look at beta.mcdgov.info at voting wallets and start doing some cross checking.  The top 100 wallets there have over 80% (almost 90 but I am eyeing the numbers) vote on something in the past 4 weeks.    The top 17 wallets there hold over 90% the total voting MKR. We are flopping around on compensation.  I ask a basic question.  If we governance goes for compensation what exactly are we getting in exchange? I am still waiting for a forum post on some suggested changes to delegation (key points).  Maker makes formal delegate positions (slots) and delegate candidates run and are elected to these slots by ranked choice voting.  A candidate must achieve a minimum MKR voting for them to get a slot (which matches what is required for them to be considered as a candidate).   Also governance should define a minimum elected delegate performance metric.  And finally no delegate should be allowed to vote more than some maximum amount of MKR defined by governance. Say minimum MKR delegated minimum vote/executive participation. You all will eventually see that forum post pop up.   But I am still digesting @Spidomo post regarding potential issues with compensating delegates. https://forum.makerdao.com/t/informal-poll-potential-issue-with-protocol-paid-delegates ",

Those kind of roles do things the DAO needs done, generally under a Core Unit funded as determined by MKR holder executive votes.  There is something weird about Professional Voter as a paid position.     psychonaut:  Delegates are not just voting. They are engaging in discussion. They are guiding us with their insight. They are more like steward executives than mere voters.   I appreciate the view that delegates (at least those who have earned recognition) could become sages, protocol visionaries guiding us through the darkness.  Some may genuinely be that and attract delegated MKR as a result. I guess I just have a simpler view of all this: If someone respects you enough to delegate their MKR voting power to you, then you get more MKR voting power. ",

                    "content": "I wanted to comment to explain my current thinking about delegate compensation. I\u2019m still thinking about this in general, so please don\u2019t take the following points as unchanging.  Recognised Delegates should be compensated As a few of the delegates have mentioned, a lot of hours go into making informed decisions. While I agree that in an ideal world informed voting within Maker would be accessible to all MKR Holders minimized time-costs, I think that where we are now, this is not something we can guarantee. As some have mentioned, delegates will be offered misaligned incentives at some point from external actors. Drawing regular compensation from the protocol increases the risk of accepting bribes from external actors, because if discovered, delegates would forfeit the regular and sanctioned income from their position as recognised delegates.  Compensation should come from the Maker Protocol rather than delegating MKR Holders Paying delegates from the protocol allows us to tax the non-governing majority of MKR tokens and compel them to share the cost of effective governance. However, doing this does also mean that individually voting MKR Holders are subsidizing delegates. On balance though, there is more inactive MKR than there is active MKR. Having the protocol pay the cost also incentivises delegation to a greater extent than if MKR Holders had to pay their delegate directly. This is perhaps reasonable for large MKR Holders, but is less ideal for smaller holders.  Amounts should be more on the level of \u2018stipend\u2019 than fulltime employment I\u2019d initially imagined 1-2k DAI per month for delegate compensation, perhaps 3k at the outside. Combined with Sourcecred, this should effectively subsidize the time spent by the Recognised Delegates to keep up with the happenings at Maker. While the DAO may at some point want to employ delegates explicitly as an \u2018executive team\u2019 complete with executive level salaries, I don\u2019t believe we are currently at the point where that is advisable. I would much rather give it a year or two to allow us to explore how delegates evolve without huge incentives.  We should wait at least a few months to see how delegation and MKR distribution settles out It\u2019s almost certainly premature to make binding decisions at this stage. By all means, the delegates and GovAlpha will be thinking about the problem, but it definitely feels early to be making explicit proposals when we\u2019re not sure where the setup will be in the near future.  Self-election is a feature, not a bug A couple of people have called out the self-election of delegates as an issue. Primarily in the case where a large MKR Holder fulfils the requirements of a Recognised Delegate in order to receive the delegate compensation. Although it may seem strange, this is actually a great trade-off for the DAO. The Recognised Delegate requirements are written such that the delegates are required to participate and communicate consistently (and will be modified to ensure this remains the case if delegates attempt to work around the requirements). If 200k total MKR becomes consistently active and communicative and offers smaller MKR Holders multiple new delegate platforms, then this increases the security and decentralization of the protocol in meaningful ways which are absolutely worth paying for.  Total cost should be limited Naturally, because there is no effective limit to the number of recognised delegates, compensation should be limited to a specific amount which is distributed among the delegates relatively according to some formula, threshold or metric. This is the part that becomes quite complex, and is where most of the effort behind putting together an effective proposal will fall.  Delegates voting their own compensation A couple of people have brought up the conflict of interest here, and yes there is obviously room for abuse. However, the balance to the delegates power is the Core Units themselves, in this case primarily GovAlpha (and any other future Governance Core Units.) GovAlpha has open lines of communication with many larger MKR Holders that either have delegated, or are planning to delegate. In the event of the delegates proposing abusive compensation for themselves, one of a few things can happen:  GovAlpha can prevent or delay the proposal from going to a vote. The Protocol Engineering Core Unit can refuse to implement the change in compensation. GovAlpha can reach out to the known larger MKR Holders and encourage them to reconsider where they are delegating their MKR. Core Units and other community members can make sure that the wider crypto community is aware of the abusive proposal.  I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll not have to resort to measures such as these for the majority of the time. The fact that these checks-on-power exist encourages delegates to approach the topic with care and with the goal of consensus building. A more stable solution here is to create a MIP that specifically prohibits delegates from proposing changes to their own compensation, instead requiring changes be proposed by Core Unit Facilitators or other community members.

I am not really feeling this. I feel this is more an either-or type of thing compared to a sliding scale. We want a Delegate to spend a minimum 10-20 hours per week reading proposals, participating in discussions and listening in on meetings. You could well argue that checking out whatever else is going on in crypto is also a part of this. A delegate is either consistently spending this amount of hours or he/she is not. When there is competition for the Delegates waking hours - either from dayjob, wife, kids whatever - the Delegate must have both incentive and excuse to say \u201cSorry, but being a Delegate is my priority\u201d and then act accordingly. I must admit I feel the Maker-Governance-as-a-hobby has already been stretched as far as it goes. If the Community feels Delegation is the way to go and that Maker should professionalize further, then rewarding Delegates so they can justify the time spent is the way forward. ",

This should not be seen as a hobby or a past-time, but a dedicated occupation at Maker which require adequate incentives. As @PaperImperium mentioned, how is one supposed to justify putting many hours a week in a venture without compensation of any type. However, Maker remains a startup, and crypto remains an uncertain realm. Maybe it does make sense to offer ~100k USD/year when the market is alive and booming, but trust me it will not if/when the market dumps and brings Maker with it. I am also opposed to the idea that this should replace Source Cred for delegates. The forum is an amazing place to learn, discuss and these incentives should be in place for everyone no matter their position. ",

That is a $1.68 million hurdle to just pass executive votes and polls. This is not software development, collateral onboarding, risk management, acting as a legally bound fiduciary and the like. If MakerDAO thinks $1.68 million is going to generate a high ROIC, then so be it. However, I think that such a compensation package should be allocated for people with actual executive management skills that have a background in running businesses and are highly educated PhDs or MBAs. I would not expect the average joe to be signing up and getting this prestigious position. Also, it might create career politicians that vote according to where the wind blows and flip flop in on an issue in order to preserve their cushy job. Whereas a small stipend means that most people will vote their conscience since they do not have reason to go wherever the wind takes them. ",

I also feel this is beyond what is reasonable at the current state of things (very dedicated individuals, fantastic community members but ultimately amateur/hobbyist level). Also, do we really need 20 delegates? The source of problems here is that, in my opinion, there has been in the last few months confusion between two possible definitions of what an \u201cofficial delegate\u201d should do: Definition 1: Somebody who decides to accept other people MKRs to vote. If he\u2019s successful in communication/choices/etc they will get a lot of MKR delegated, ortherwise not. Simple. and Definition 2: The above, plus taking an active role (=hours of work) in evaluating proposals, participating to the forum, stay on top of things etc. In my opinion, the right definition should be Definition 1, which leaves a lot of freedom and no real duties, and this should be compensated just with SourceCred. If some people want to scale up their Delegate job (and likely attract more and more MKR) then they are free to do that. They will likely start to do some/all the points of Definition (2), as in a free market! As a result they will get more voting power (Note: voting power HAS value, even if not directly convertible to USD). IMHO: If you are just an individual with a regular job, family duties, other hobbies, etc\u2026 just delegate for fun as a nice way to participate actively to MakerDao. If you are instead a large MKR holder, or you represent some big holders, of you have economical incentives to have large voting power in MakerDAO, then do your own calculations and do more \u201cdelegate activity\u201d which will likely get you more MKR delgated.

A typical day for me (weekends are about half of this):  1-2 hours on the forums/reading proposal drafts sent to me 0-2 hours on calls about G&R, proposed CUs, collateral, etc 2+ hours on calls/chats with DAO members expressing private complaints/suggestions/feedback/responding to an information request I had/discussing potential moves forward/requesting review of proposals they will make to the forum later 2+ hours on calls/emails with external actors. This ranges from startups that want to know how to do business with us, academic researchers looking for data or simply having questions about DeFi and Maker, agencies/central bank staff asking similar questions, US congressional staff trying to keep us informed/wanting to be informed, financial institutions to see who is willing to do business with us for specific things, et al.  Given that I and other delegates have the same time endowment of 24 hours a day as anyone else here, and given that six-figure incomes are the norm for full-time employees of the DAO, understand that if you expect good governance, something has to be paid for that time. Also understand that delegates \u2013 along with actors like PE and probably others \u2013 are amongst the most exposed to any legal action taken against the DAO. There is a non-zero risk to taking part in governance in this manner. Delegates when being prepped for the launch of delegation were also repeatedly led to expect compensation. I am, quite frankly, shocked to hear numbers like 1-2k DAI/month bandied about. The refrain throughout this whole process was something like, \u201cWell, once delegates are in place, it seems natural they will vote themselves some pay.\u201d The most junior, part-time pay for GovAlpha facilitators is 62,400 DAI/year, according to their budget. Other CUs also have plenty of very junior roles that are extremely well compensated, even by American standards. Facilitators generally make much, much more in most CUs. Surely those you are entrusting to do such distasteful work as understand the overall goings-on at Maker and lead it in a sustainable direction deserve some pay. To be quite frank, the proposed $7k/month came from my own suggestion based on the income I forgo to put in these hours (I am self-employed), and I think it is extremely generous, as it includes no requests for MKR and will not allow anyone to retire to a private island any time soon. Let me be blunt: Maker is in a very difficult legal and economic position. We are very far behind on many, many fronts, and quite frankly, if we do not navigate the next 12-18 months well, I suspect Maker will end up in the dustbin of DeFi history. There is so, so much work to be done if we don\u2019t want to be predated upon by regulators, scammers, or simply our competition. Finally, other protocols and start ups are absolutely offering compensation for much less legally exposed/stressful roles. Maker is a unique and beautiful beast, but we will end up with trash tier or disengaged delegates if Maker is unwilling to at least meet other offers half or even a third of the way. I see great things ahead for Maker. But we don\u2019t need a gaggle of \u201cvote now\u201d button mashers. We need about 5 or 10 strong leaders who can be the glue that holds together our sprawling DAO structure while also being the strength in Maker\u2019s arm to hack through this jungle of regulatory and economic dangers. I welcome more comments and suggestions on amounts and structure \u2013 someone suggested a Delegate CU that can then be billed by delegates and provide legal defense if necessary. I do think it\u2019s probably time to move this to a formal Signal Request unless more suggestions are made beyond \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d ",

It\u2019s after all not too long since the entire Protocol was jammed because we couldn\u2019t raise the debt ceiling quickly enough. Delegates enable us to pass executives quickly and to be more reactive. Delegates enabling the smooth operation of Governance will likely be necessary for the coming months to years if we are to grow and hopefully establish DAI as the premier stablecoin. For this, they should be compensated. I would support the creation of a Delegate CU which @makerman had also mentioned previously. This would allow delegates to budget for legal expenses among other expenses such as gas fees. It would seem only fair for the DAO to provide these as delegates are taking on legal risk on our behalf. It would also enable some more transparency regarding the pay of delegates - possibly hourly billing to avoid over-rewarding delegates who are less involved in the Governance process. Obviously, a delegate could opt not to join the CU but would not experience the benefits. It could almost be considered akin to a union in that regard. Regarding PaperImperium\u2019s post above - I hope you aren\u2019t taking on too much responsibility, especially for free. Things like:     PaperImperium:  2+ hours on calls/emails with external actors. This ranges from startups that want to know how to do business with us, academic researchers looking for data or simply having questions about DeFi and Maker, agencies/central bank staff asking similar questions, US congressional staff trying to keep us informed/wanting to be informed, financial institutions to see who is willing to do business with us for specific things   should probably be directed towards relevant CUs. Certainly, some of that seems like work for the Growth CU. Although I am sure we need to expand our CU base to cover some of the other areas, but that is a conversation for another day. ",

That being said, we should move swiftly on this if we can.  Full-time delegates @PaperImperium  clearly articulates that the most important detail to capture is the full-time commitment some delegates have put in.  Informed time     AstronautThis:  Our proposals and execs need to remain readable and digestible for everyone and should not require anywhere near this amount of time to understand.   While I agree here, and considerable work goes into making votes digestible, the full context, I think, is what takes the most time. Anyone can YOLO vote after 30 mins of reading, but acting as a steward for a long time is work. We have to be honest with the data and ourselves (as a community).     Patrick_J:  this was probably an oversight at that time and should have been openly discussed prior to the system going live.   Most definitely an unknown at implementation, and in due time we\u2019ll come to a solution that works.  Nothing is ever perfect at launch.     AstronautThis:  I think delegates have taken on a bunch of extra hats to wear that are beyond their mandate.   Slightly agree, there\u2019s definitely a balance to strike, and I think this thread is jumping to extreme dichotomies too quickly.  Getting delegated to is enough I\u2019m trying not to stir the pot, but I really think these viewpoints are missing something; I can\u2019t quite put my finger on it.     iammeeoh:  As a result they will get more voting power (Note: voting power HAS value, even if not directly convertible to USD).       Spidomo:  I guess I just have a simpler view of all this: If someone respects you enough to delegate their MKR voting power to you, then you get more MKR voting power.   All I can come up with is, \u201ccan clout buy a sandwich\u201d and the answer is sadly, no.   Still just a poll     AstronautThis:  I strongly disagree with this proposal because it takes a step towards making governance participation inaccessible to nearly everyone.       ejbarraza:  The wealthiest nation on Earth pays half of working Americans 35k/year or less. You are asking for well over twice that.   I\u2019ve noticed in general that we\u2019re jumping to \u201cthis is what we\u2019re doing? what???\u201d so expensive!!! This is wrong\u2026\" far too quickly. I\u2019ll reiterate that this is the first step, we\u2019re not at the proposal stage. Yet, again, I think we should move relatively quickly.  Next Steps It seems that the most important next steps here are to sort out the details (e.g., another vote). This should allow us to balance overwork for voting and shape the improvements we need across the board (makerman\u2019s ideas, thresholds, costs, and conflicts of interest).  For part-timers, I think Long is right on track with a stipend + sourcecred. In addition, we have to calculate around the cap of delegates compared with MKR delegated, vote performance, full-time, and communication. The next poll will have more options, helping us shape a proposal. Thanks to everyone for sharing their initial reactions! ",

If I wanted to bribe delegate X then I would privately make a deal to send 10 MKR to X as a bribe if X voted the way I want. But as soon as delegate X votes my way, X might lose all the delegated MKR weight (if the decision is bad enough). Maybe the vote will close before all the delegated MKR weight is gone, but how long will the delegated MKR stay with delegate X? What do I get for my bribe? All the votes for a week? Probably not much more than that. It seems like bribes are most worthwhile when delegates are elected for fixed terms. ",

                    "content": "    PaperImperium:  A typical day for me (weekends are about half of this):  1-2 hours on the forums/reading proposal drafts sent to me 0-2 hours on calls about G&R, proposed CUs, collateral, etc 2+ hours on calls/chats with DAO members expressing private complaints/suggestions/feedback/responding to an information request I had/discussing potential moves forward/requesting review of proposals they will make to the forum later 2+ hours on calls/emails with external actors. This ranges from startups that want to know how to do business with us, academic researchers looking for data or simply having questions about DeFi and Maker, agencies/central bank staff asking similar questions, US congressional staff trying to keep us informed/wanting to be informed, financial institutions to see who is willing to do business with us for specific things, et al.    So wanted to weigh in from the Governance side here as I think there is some valuable conversation to be had about these points. From a community engagement side this is list is awesome. We want delegates that are keeping up with the DAO and contributing where their skills fit. However, this list is far different than what the requirements for being a recognized delegate are. All in all it\u2019s pretty easy to qualify as a recognized delegate. Post a platform, do a call, vote and let people know what you voted on. All that could be done with very low effort. The hope being that those putting in more effort, giving better communications, and expanding their understanding would garner more MKR than the delegates not putting in the effort. But there is no guarantee that will hold true, nor that every delegate will feel the need to put so many hours in per day. So while all this stuff is appreciated, it is above and beyond the requirements for a recognized delegate and we lack the formal structure to verify this kind of effort across delegates.     PaperImperium:  Delegates when being prepped for the launch of delegation were also repeatedly led to expect compensation. I am, quite frankly, shocked to hear numbers like 1-2k DAI/month bandied about. The refrain throughout this whole process was something like, \u201cWell, once delegates are in place, it seems natural they will vote themselves some pay.\u201d The most junior, part-time pay for GovAlpha facilitators is 62,400 DAI/year, according to their budget. Other CUs also have plenty of very junior roles that are extremely well compensated, even by American standards. Facilitators generally make much, much more in most CUs.   So I attended many of these meetings and the conversation was centered around the game theory fact that if delegation is successful, the delegates will have the voting power to approve Delegate Compensation, provided their proposal isn\u2019t so drastic that it would cause MKR holders to un-delegate. This lead us to the conclusion that once delegation is fully established, compensation is likely to take place. While I appreciate the call out to GovAlpha\u2019s Facilitator Renumeration (something that did cause quite the discussion when proposed), I don\u2019t think this is a fair basis to compare in terms of responsibility. I make no judgements about what you or other delegates might deserve for all your effort, but again circling back to the recognized delegate requirements, we see a big mismatch in what facilitators for CUs are responsible for and what Recognized Delegates must do. Additionally, Facilitators can be removed by governance where as delegates, especially those with significant voting power, can do far more in the name of keeping their position and title. Speaking for the GovAlpha financials (it\u2019s blockchain so nothing you couldn\u2019t see if you were looking for it) we frequency pay contributors 1-2k per month for similar requirements of protocol knowledge and public weekly communications. Again not a judgement on the value delegates deserve, but to give some context on why that number was thrown out. Basing compensation on the requirements rather than current delegate performance will be important if we want this to scale, maybe that means we need to revisit the requirements as well.  All in all, I think the conversation on Delegate Compensation is important, and to @twblack88 's point this poll is just about getting the conversation started. When a proposal comes for delegate compensation, it will need to weigh the vulnerabilities of the easy to obtain Recognized Delegate status to prevent outright gaming. This won\u2019t be an easy task, as basing compensation on delegated stake would allow large holders to become recognized and delegate to themselves. With that said, I remain confident we can find a way to appropriately compensate delegates while keeping the protocol safe from gaming and free-riding. ",

Opinions will very and unless a vote is so outrageous that it becomes a focal point, it is unlikely that this bribe taking would surface if executed with the intent to stay hidden. Additionally, part of the argument for delegation was that many MKR voters don\u2019t have time to pay attention to every vote. So as much as it seems safe to say in the long run good voting for delegates should garner more MKR, in the short term individual votes are unlikely to impact delegate voting weight unless they are particularly out of line with stated goals.

None of those things are true for delegates. The ask here is absurd - you want delegates to simply take over existing CU responsibilities with less coordination and less oversight and be paid for it?

How enterprise profitability relates to \u2018equitable compensation\u2019 is itself a whole other issue but related when considered from a sustainability standpoint. The real issue here is governance goals, and more importantly what are the proper mechanics to align interests of MKR holder not just with delegates, but with governance needs generally. I posted elsewhere the idea that delegates should be elected positions, with compensation packages. https://forum.makerdao.com/t/suggested-changes-to-maker-delegation-system I probably spent a good day not just talking to some former politicians and political science folks on this but then had to write it up and post it. After more careful consideration and feedback from GovAlpha and a few other parties I realized the above may not be what Maker needs.    Though when I think about this from @PaperImperium and myself point of view of doing CU work I do wonder whether a few actual elected delegate positions with compensation packages might be appropriate or whether CUs might have budget lines to compensate delegates who they feel have contributed materially to the achievement of their responsibilities.  Point here is we want some reasonably clean delineation between governance and CUs.  This has to be cooperative, but it also has to have some sort of recognition of effort (compensation). I keep coming back to goal(s). I have a request into GovAlpha for data from beta.mcdgov.info to provide a governance report and hope to suggest some governance wallet performance metrics that should be useful to governance generally. In effect I am taking on GovAlpha work that I could have just thrown at them but when I look at the resources GovAlpha has to take on such a project I concluded what I wanted to see probably wouldn\u2019t be done in a reasonable time if at all.  I am still waiting on the data btw to conduct this analysis.    The prime reason for it was to analyze wallet governance performance, cost, and reactivity metrics that I have already constructed to apply them to a reward model I want to present to settle multiple issues at once: Construction of Appropriate/equitable wallet compensation (for all wallets not just delegates) The simple upshot here is that all of MKR is benefiting from the activities of a few governance participants.    In the past compensation for the work of the governance participants was proposed and turned down via @prose11 MIP49. https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip49-staking-rewards I believe we need to revist MIP49 due to this discussion regarding delegate compensation. It is simpler if I give an example that illustrates the thinking here. 1  If MakerDAO governance believes governance participation (particularly executive support, but polling as well) is AS critical to the functioning of Maker as particular CUs then it is appropriate to compensate this governance participation in direct relation to the importance of the participation (hence why a wallet participation metric is required). 2  If participating is important and should be rewarded, then shouldn\u2019t non-participation be punished?  Fortunately there is a reward model which is fair from the point of view of how governance currently works that satisfies both 1 & 2 above.  1  Mint .1% MKR/yr to be distributed according to a reward model to all wallets based on a wallet governance performance metric that is linear both to MKR being voted and % vote participation with some division E:P for executive and poll (this can be 1:1 or 2:1 or whatever ratio governance or GovAlpha suggests/chooses) .1% MKR/yr currently would be approximately 998MKR/yr currently valued around 3.6M USD.   Distribute this MKR based on the above wallet performance metric. Governace currently has approximately 170K MKR in governance. Lets say delegates are bots and vote 100% on everything 28K votes on everything 25K votes on everything 7K votes on everything 17K votes on 1/2 5K votes on 1/2 of everything 50% vote participation and 30K votes maybe 25% of the time. Calculate the total wallet importance metrics. (25K+28K+7K)1 + (17K+5K).5 + 30K*.25 = 78.5K MKR*vote is the performance metric for this example. These voters would share 998MKR or for each 1K MKR*vote they would earn 998/75 = 12.7133MKR Hence the voters would earn 25K = 317.83MKR 28K = 355.97MKR 7K = 90MKR [email\u00a0protected] = 108.06MKR [email\u00a0protected] = 31.78MKR [email\u00a0protected] = 95.35MKR Now me with my lowly 8.7MKR (even if I have 100% participation) approximately .110MKR (or 360US). Lets put this in perspective btw.   One reason why I wanted network costs.   Even this kind of compensation is NOT going to compensate me for Ethereum network tx fees.     But this will give more than appropriate compensation for the top delegates.   It is also fair because it is relative to the amount of MKR they bring to the table (as a delegate or not). One can run numbers if 20-30-40% of MKR were to participate in governance but lets be realistic here we probably need a minimum of 10% and probably will never get more than 50%. Now whether delegates should get all of the pie or say 1/2 of the \u2018rewards\u2019 is a whole different matter but I think if we want to inspire delegation and maintain delegate compensation to be appropriate based on the most important metric MKR being voted, participating in governance this should be both on the amount of MKR and their voter participation.   We can ask whether 17K MKR voting 50% of the time is worse or better than 7K MKR.   We can also divy up this .1% MKR/yr equivalent (in MKR, DAI, USD or whatever cost) into different slots. say 75% goes in the 1:1 model I suggest above.   15% basically goes as the sqrt of this participation during the period, and say 10% as bonus compensation to be portioned out by a vote of delegates for execptional reconition of any effort in governance.  What-EVER. The biggest issues here are:  Compensation being in proportion to MKR and voting participation - this is to eliminate sybils - people breaking up wallets to earn more. Rewarding participation with an amount that makes sense for people to participate. Effectively solves the delegation problem.   Basically to make a decent \u2018salary\u2019 a delegate only needs to get about 25-30MKR/yr of compensation and in the above model this would approximate 2-3K MKR delegated to them  (double this if the rewards are split between the delegate and delegee)  No matter how we turn this.  Maker can continue to try to get free work, free participation hoping that parties will make due diligence, and pay the ever growing costs to transact on chain, or it can decide there is a real value here.    I believe we need to take something on the order of the .1% MKR dilution cost value hit to re-distribute the compensation to those who are spending time and paying to secure this system.   If we don\u2019t then we will rapidly be back at having issues passing executives, much less having our 3rd branch of operations (governance) actively participating in the system.   Might as well divide up the 84K MKR remaining between CUs and just have them all \u2018do governance\u2019 in their CU mandate for the other 916K out there who don\u2019t. I want to be clear here.   The exact details of the model, the amount of effective value via MKR dilution, and the distribution is only relevant as an example.    I am convinced a revist to MIP49 after a GovAlpha governance report like I am going to attempt would actually give us some real tangible metrics to focus rewards on and real performance data to work with.    I don\u2019t think this is an \u2018if\u2019 but more of an appropriate \u2018model\u2019 and \u2018amount\u2019.   I am more convinced doing this via a revisited MIP49 is the best way.   I also think a pass through for delegates to the delegatee is appropriate.   I\u2019d love to just kick back, pay the big delegation network tx fee to delegate my 8.7 MKR to someone, and collect some chunk of the rewards I via the system pay my delegate to deal with me.    Others who own 1-2K MKR can earn some extra income participating in governance which is what we all want.   The whales that delegate earn some passive income and give their delegates excellent pay.   I see the above as a win-win-win for ALL parties and fulfills my stakeholder recognition and a fairness core value I should add to my platform. The only losers here is the MKR that doesn\u2019t participate or delegate which is exactly the correct result given the system constraints and they probably won\u2019t vote anyway on this.  If all of this MKR were to delegate or participate then the dilution and governance participation is fair across the board. The key issue is to convince the whales - which is basically @PaperImperium @Planet_X @flipflopflapdelegate and a few other delegates as well as some fraction of remaining governance this is good and get a proposal together with details.   We can fine tune this as we go. As to length.   FAIL My apologies.   Best I can do on this complicated subject and without spending the rest of my day editing down.  I already spent far more time on this one topic than is expected from a delegate for one or two weeks of governance participation. ",

For me, voting is a no-brainer. It is ill-advised to compensate voting per se because a robot can mindlessly vote; that degree of judgment is worthless. So I\u2019m still essentially against MIP 49 style compensation. To me, what we\u2019re paying for by compensating delegates is all the non-tangible activity. Paper posted a good list earlier in this thread.     AstronautThis:  The ask here is absurd - you want delegates to simply take over existing CU responsibilities with less coordination and less oversight and be paid for it?   Yes, take over existing CU responsibilities where delegates see an opportunity to do so in coordination with a bird\u2019s eye view of the whole project. As for oversight, I\u2019m not sure why you think CUs automatically have more oversight than recognized delegates who have to publically communicate their judgment on all manner of DAO concerns on a regular basis.     AstronautThis:  The role of delegate never involved any of these added responsibilities when it was proposed . It is only in this thread that some delegates have assumed that they\u2019d be wearing every hat there is to be worn in the DAO.   Your disparaging attitude is damaging to morale. Instead of welcoming innovative new approaches of contributing to our shared mission, you seem content to witness a temporary declaration of defeat,     PaperImperium:  Perhaps you are correct.

The root of the problem is the board question of decision-making at MakerDAO. Board members should be a light role. If it gets operational, the judgment is altered. They are usually not so much in the light. In a MakerDAO context, that can be done by providing guidance to CU or what they want to see on the governance poll/executives. I guess it\u2019s close from @AstronautThis view. I understand @PaperImperium and @psychonaut views are more of a director role with an operational view, authority, and leadership.   twitter.com    PaperImperium @ImperiumPaper    A DAO shouldn\u2019t be without leaders or authority.  Successful DAOs will be many-headed hydra, not headless do-nothings. Multiple generals win the war, one general wins the battle, and no general is just a mob waiting to be predated upon.  Which model is YOUR #DAO using?   1:12 AM - 3 Sep 2021           4                psychonaut:  If there is overlap in responsibility between the Growth CU and Recognized Delegates, why should delegates stand down? Why shouldn\u2019t the Growth CU cede some of its responsibility to delegates?   It is my understanding that delegates can\u2019t have authority nor leadership as they represent some MKR holders not the DAO. Only the DAO can appoint someone (which it currently doesn\u2019t do formally). Obviously, there is a political incentive for delegates to use such \u201cleadership and authority\u201d to start negotiating with third part actors in order to get successes and increase their political goodwill. The delegates that bring BlockFi with a 1B vault at MakerDAO will be acclaimed for sure. But do we want 10 delegates contacting/negotiating with BlockFi and undermining the work of Growth? At the same time, I do understand we might need some kind of director/co-CEO. But then if we have board members and directors, how is a DAO different than a company? I also have a concern that delegates limit transparency. Currently, we only need to have @PaperImperium and @Planet_X to pass a Gov Poll. Why bother to have an open discussion when we can be more efficient by asking the decision-makers what they want directly? Is it good or is it bad? No clue. Moreover, currently, >80% of the voting power of the delegates comes from the same person (which has still at least 25k MKR more to use). We are clearly in a better position than last month for sure, but there is still some progress to be made. In a sense, we have traded decentralization for efficiency. I understand that this discussion is about compensation, but in my view, it\u2019s the least of the problem (meaning I don\u2019t care if delegates get 0 DAI or 10k). ",

My point is that if you pay 10 people full-time they will be more active. And MakerDAO should be clear of what authority is delegated to them. My main point above is really that a board member and director are 2 distinct roles that you can\u2019t do at the same time. You can\u2019t be operating and keeping a remote perspective. Or maybe you can but it would be great to understand how we work. See below for an example of what I understand. You can be in different seats at the same time but those are not the same seats.  makerdao-gov21977\u00d71139 163 KB  Regarding decentralization, I don\u2019t see an increase in the MKR in the governance contract which, in my view, should be the north star here (and I agree we are early). One can even argue that one big whale is now acting more strongly on the decisions (indirectly tho). Nevertheless, I see an increase in efficiency (x10). Overall, that\u2019s a big win.  image968\u00d7391 18.3 KB  ",

                    "content": "A little late to the party, but what about a \u201cPaid Delegate\u201d role which is separate from delegation, with a standard compensation across the board? Something parallel to CUs? I\u2019d be pleasantly surprised to see a compensation scheme with rules/threshold/etc for delegates which is not subject to some gaming, but it sounds super hard to design. Alternatively we could unbundle and say:  Receiving some MKRs to vote with is an arrangement between the MKR holder and the delegate. The delegate gains voting power and in exchange most likely is expected to stay on top of most things Maker. Maybe the MKR holder directly pays the delegate, maybe not. There is no a priori judgment from Maker Governance about whether being delegated large amounts of MKR in and of itself deserves monetary compensation. I think it\u2019s reasonable to say that having publically received even large amounts of delegated MKR & following the very light Recognised Delegate requirements should not automatically mean you must be compensated. Governance may pick participants following some agreed upon rules and compensate them. Some delegates will seek compensation by applying to be a Paid Delegate, others not. Since governance is reasonable and knows being a good delegate takes a lot of time and effort, delegates that actively participate on forums & elsewhere will be compensated. Well compensated, I hope. But this is separate from just \u201chaving received delegated MKR\u201d, and the compensation is for the work, not the voting power.  With this scheme over time new people pop up, participate, convince some holders to delegate to them, and at some point they apply to be a Paid Delegate. The point is that compensation happens through a separate, case-by-case governance process. I expect that using this scheme would not change anything for the current recognised delegates since they\u2019re all well-known and active community members. Flaws I see with this scheme:  Delegates can of course vote to receive compensation, but that is fair game. More governance overhead compared to a set of rules well-defined enough that they can almost be automated.  Finally, an alternative is to modify the Recognised Delegate status and a) increase its requirements (more active participation) b) make access to the status dependent on a governance vote, c) make compensation part of being a recognised delegate.
