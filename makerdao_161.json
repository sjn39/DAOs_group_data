They stream payouts, as well as a vested token that\u2019s locked up, presumably re-using the code and infra from Honeyswap and their farms that support time locks. I would love to do something like this, but yeah, potentially a lot of work, and between Maker and SourceCred I\u2019m really slammed these days, so hesitant to commit. But would def support if there\u2019s community interest and help. P.S. shoutout to Sablier, the original money streaming protocol, which got its start from a Maker dev grant. ",
