                    "content": "MKR holders: I need your vote! There\u2019s a subtle but important vote going on right now that I believe influences the long-term health and incentives of the keeper ecosystem. https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmcALf82?network=mainnet Backstory: typically, arbitrageurs / keepers mint and short Dai to provide liquidity to the peg, with the expectation of a small profit. They also assume that governance will act in the protocol\u2019s long-term self-interest in helping keep the peg stable. If governance fails to coordinate properly, and keepers lose faith in governance, then the peg will start to drift upwards without anyone stepping in to sell it. This is why we saw the peg drift as high as $1.05 over the summer (after the surge of yield farming demand), and stay there. Keepers weren\u2019t confident enough that governance could act swiftly enough and apply the correct incentives. Clearly, we can see how incentives are important in all this. Eventually, governance pulled through and the USDC-A Liquidation Ratio (LR) was lowered to 103%, and the peg came down to $1.03. This was much needed relief. But the peg was then just merely stuck at $1.03. So, then, the LR was lowered to 101%, and the peg dropped down to $1.01. These actions were HUGELY beneficial to the peg, especially in light of the fact that governance does not or would not want to consider negative interest rates at this time. Myself, and several other keepers (and long-time community members) I have spoken to, continued to stay short due to our expectation that governance would remain vigilant in its duty to restore the peg, and continue to take actions that would eventually bring the peg down to $1. Remember, these shorts were put on 2 - 3 months ago. Instead, what we saw was no further action with respect to the LR, and, worse, an increase in the Stability Fee to 4%. An increase in the stability typically is counter-intuitive when the peg is strong but in this case made sense since governance assumed that a lot of the newly minted Dai was being used for yield farming. While this is partially correct, it ignores the fact that a significant portion of the Dai generated from USDC was actually being used purely to arbitrage the peg downwards using recursive leverage on Compound. These keepers (myself being one of them) are vitally important actors in this ecosystem. And they were now losing money, while governance sat on its hands a bit. Our principal bled dry while the peg remained broken. Recently, it came to light that Dai was losing integrations from key partners. This is simply unacceptable when governance has the ability and power to fix the peg. We\u2019ve reached a point where it makes sense for the protocol to take urgent action to immediately fix the peg (as closely as possible). While I advocated for dropping the LR to 100.1% (due to its simplicity), the community has decided to implement the Peg Stability Module (PSM), which was originally proposed in July (and then stalled). While this is a valid option, it could take several months to implement, according to the current senior smart contract dev at the Maker Foundation (audits, testing, governance, etc). In the meantime, the keepers, who are the primary stabilizers of the peg, are at risk of losing all of their principal on a trade they should, reasonably speaking, be making money on. For MakerDAO to delay fixing the peg by going the PSM route (remember: if they wanted, they could fix the peg this week by dropping the LR to 100.1%), and still keep the stability fee punitively high at 4%, eroding all of the profits of the keepers, is a very, very poor incentive. This short term greedy move by the MKR holders will end up driving away a significant portion of the keepers in the ecosystem. The next time the peg breaks to $0.94 (like in Q1 of 2019) or $1.05 (summer 2020), the keepers will not have the confidence to step in and take the other side of the trade. This post is already pretty beefy so I\u2019m going to stop here but happy to answer questions. Plenty of stuff to expand on from the above. Also, this is obviously a nuanced, subtle topic. I am not arguing there is a definite right answer here. I can totally understand this both ways, but genuinely believe that my framing is better for the long-term health of the ecosystem. That\u2019s how I positioned my trade. Ethically, I wouldn\u2019t put on a trade and then expect MakerDAO to act against it\u2019s own self-interest and try to convince it as such. Full disclosure: I\u2019m short Dai and I am talking up my book. I post this message not from the perspective of a risk manager, but from that of a profit-motivated keeper. tl;dr:  please vote for 0% in this week\u2019s stablecoin stability fee governance poll in order to preserve and protect the keeper ecosystem until the PSM can properly be put in place.

The keepers simply follow these incentives. Some incentives goes towards Keepers. Some incentives goes towards MKR holders (like the SF) and can be viewed as \u2018penalties\u2019 for keepers. If these are not good, just close your position with a small loss. @cyrus are you also a MKR holder or just a keeper?     cyrus:  I have spoken to, continued to stay short due to our expectation that governance would remain vigilant in its duty to restore the peg   Your goal should just be to make money. Game-theoretical incentives. No need for sacrifices.     cyrus:  These keepers (myself being one of them) are vitally important actors in this ecosystem. And they were now losing money, while governance sat on its hands a bit.   Many actors involved in the MakerDAO dynamics, from DAI holders, to MKR holders, to keepers, to CDP holders, etc. sometimes lose and sometimes make money. E.g.:  MKR holders lost money on Black to preserve the peg. some cdp holders lost money on Black Thursday due to the auctions. etc  It\u2019s not a safe game.     cyrus:  While I advocated for dropping the LR to 100.1% (due to its simplicity), the community has decided to implement the Peg Stability Module  (PSM), which was originally proposed in July (and then stalled).   You said in the Maker chat: btw, this is the reason i argued heavily, heavily against the PSM internally back when it was proposed in june for the record you also said: the foundation was set to proceed with it despite my objections, and then pulled back due to entirely different reasons. In any case, it seems that the Governance now finds the idea of the PSM to be preferable vs 100.1% LR. This is just to say that your (Keeper) point of view is/was against what the majority of the Governance (at least in the forum) currently thinks.     cyrus:  While this is a valid option, it could take several months to implement, according to the current senior smart contract dev at the Maker Foundation (audits, testing, governance, etc).   This is the sentence I dislike the most from your post.  Who are the \u2018senior smart contract dev\u2019 who spoke with? And when did you speak with them?  The code of SAM is available in the github, we are set for an accelerated implementation of the PSM. So, can you please expand? Some people think that launching the PSM by the end of November is possible.     cyrus:  This short term greedy move by the MKR holders will end up driving away a significant portion of the keepers in the ecosystem.   Keepers are speculators. They will come back when there is money to be made. Furthermore the PEG is already at 1.005:1 right now.

The peg went down when countermeasures were deployed. if we had to rely on keepers only, the peg would be 1.5:1 by now. The peg is kept at 1:1 by a system of game-theoretic incentives and penalties. The keepers simply follow these incentives.   I think the way I view it is that keepers are designed to frontrun those incentives (otherwise Vault owners and Dai holders would have to transact directly with one another, and that would be a massive coordination failure). If they work harmoniously with governance, they they can preempt policy and provide more consistent stability and liquidity to the peg. As a market maker, you can make deeper, more liquid markets if you believe you are in sync with the governance mandate.They take a risk in doing so, and should they be wrong, they wlll book a loss. For that specific reason, I have not spoken up for the prior 2 months. Remember, I am 2 months into this short, and I never spoke a word because I assumed that I had misread governance. Charging 4% against yield farmers vaguely made sense, and the peg wasn\u2019t horrendous. I was almost resigned to being wrong and taking the loss (even though I felt it was a bit punitive. You\u2019d expect someone short Dai to be able to cover within ~3 months, or at the very least break even). It wasn\u2019t until last week when Greg brought up losing Dai integrations that I said to myself (\u201cexploited,\u201d if you want to be cynical), that maybe governance isn\u2019t really doing its best job acting in its own self-interest. As a result of the overall situation, they decided to accelerate the PSM. So, I\u2019m okay taking the loss if that\u2019s the direction governance deliberately wants to go in. But I do think it\u2019s silly for governance to essentially say \u201cwell you were right all along, we do agree we should get more active in fixing the peg urgently, and we have a plan that we\u2019re actively working on, but we\u2019re going to make sure we milk every last penny we can from the keepers in the process.\u201d To me hat doesn\u2019t sound like the right incentive you want to apply to keepers. Poor keeper incentives were a part of the reason no one showed up on Black Thursday.     iammeeoh:  Many actors involved in the MakerDAO dynamics, from DAI holders, to MKR holders, to keepers, to CDP holders, etc. sometimes lose and sometimes make money. E.g.:  MKR holders lost money on Black to preserve the peg. some cdp holders lost money on Black Thursday due to the auctions. etc  It\u2019s not a safe game.   Totally agree. I view this post as governance in action. More like politics actually. Which isn\u2019t limited just to MKR holders, but all actors in the ecosystem. I am fully open to the idea that this isn\u2019t a black and white situation. I am not \u201cdefinitely right.\u201d In fact, I could be way off on all this, and part of my goal was to strike up a public discussion. If I\u2019m wrong, then I\u2019d love to hear some well reasoned arguments, and for governance to vote against me. However, because this is inherently political, I can\u2019t help but campaign for my own position.     iammeeoh:  This is the sentence I dislike the most from your post.  Who are the \u2018senior smart contract dev\u2019 who spoke with? And when did you speak with them?  The code of SAM is available in the github, we are set for an accelerated implementation of the PSM. So, can you please expand?   Coincidentally, this is also the sentence I dislike most from your post. It sounds like you think I am being deceptive about my intentions when I couldn\u2019t be more blatantly transparent. I\u2019m even burning a fair amount of my own social capital to convince governance to do something it probably should have done so on its own already. Might I remind you the peg has been broken for 8 months now. And for the record, this was from the GnR chat yesterday by Chris.  \u201cWe may be time constrained this year anyway. I am having difficulty seeing the PSM making the 2020 executives unless there are audits ASAP.\u201d A second smart contract dev I spoke to echoed the same sentiment. ",

As I see it, the best shot PSM has at making it in by the end of the year is to swap the flash mint module, MIP25, with the PSM.  We can only do that if the PSM is signaled for, and gets a comprehensive review from domain teams and outside auditors/engineers.  As I\u2019m sure most of you know, the foundations SC team cannot be involved with the PSM.  This puts a lot on the community and @hexonaut to get this through.  However, if the PSM is completely ready, I think we could probably swap MIP25 for it. Edit: I made this its own post: 2020 Year End Schedule ",

But of course, if something miraculous happens and we see a push back to those levels, then at least I will not loose the investment (which would be great of course!).

For Dec 18th (or one week later, after the vote is approved and PSM \u201cpublished\u201d) then he\u2019ll need already DAI to worth 0.999 for breaking even. Fees continues accumulating (PSM doesn\u2019t set fees to 0!). For January he\u2019ll need 0.99 or lower DAI values. CDP will be abandoned with tens of millions of USDC and fees in DAI being sent toward the surplus buffer.
