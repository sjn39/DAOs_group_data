People who deposit their UNIs in the master contract will receive Token # 2 distributed decentrally, these tokens will be necessary to be able to introduce liquidity in the future pools. As the master contract (token # 1) remains blocked, the liquidity leak cannot exist since it is an ecosystem that can only grow in terms of liquidity contained within it. The liquidity introduced in the master contract (the UNI\u2019s) will be used as the community decides (1/3 of it will always remain blocked to redeem the # 3 tokens), this liquidity can also be used to increase the value of the contained liquidity within the vaults of token # 2, further increasing the price of the base of our master contract (UNI). The liquidity they introduce with token # 2 will be used to create loan services such as Aave, as well as to provide liquidity to many decentralized and even centralized exchanges. The rewards for providing liquidity will be distributed through token # 3 and 1/3 of these can be claimed daily in the form of USD, thus providing a basis to avoid the sudden lack of liquidity, in addition to the liquidity providers in an easy way and sure to keep your investment growing. As the master contract grows, we will absorb liquidity blocked for a certain time, thus also reducing the circulating amount of the coins introduced into the vault, thus increasing their price, since the same e exists in the external ecosystem. even higher demand. In the pools of token # 2 we can enter BTC, USD, ETH, Gold, and even Company shares, and real state assets. thus creating a more stable ecosystem. After the time frame of master contract expires, users can redeem their full rewards plus their inicial Investment. TLDR; Create a filter contract for UNI holders and make it a full Decentralized ecosystem wich can only be accessed through UNI, increasing UNI price, UNI staked will be blocked, or leveraged, or another Strategy the Community decides ",

We can decide to sell those 100 million UNI into the market, leverage them, or work with them as we want. The other tokens are useless tokens outside the master contract ecosystem (they wont even be able to escape the ecosystem since they are going to be trapped inside the governance system) and since the only way to get Token3 is by getting UNI, and token 3 cannot escape contract ecosystem we can asure that tokens 2 and 3 are just for measuring internal operations.

The fact that there is $UNI on exchanges means that those who received the airdrop decided the value was worth more than governing the system. This is a good thing as it removed neutral/bad actors and provided an opportunity for users who want to govern the network to purchase tokens. The declining price of UNI is a good thing, as it allows the system to more decentralized by lowering the cost of entry. Those who seek to govern Uniswap should buy tokens while its low, giving the eventual whales less power. Eliminating arbitrage trading would also negatively affect turnover in governance. If Uniswap flourishes, we can expect the price to increase. Governing users who hold UNI that maybe don\u2019t have time to dedicate to the system anymore can cash out and be rewarded for their work while allowing new users into the system. Market forces already generally balance things out, once DEXs are more common/the norm, they will balance things out even more effectively. For these reasons I consider this proposal somewhat a moot point, at least until the market matures; if anything it should be something shelved until later in the year after governance switches in October.

Arbitragers are traders, they\u2019re not liquidity provider, this will not eliminate them. Not only this, arbitrager are needed by UniSwap as an ecosystem as they help to stabilize the markets among several exchanges. The whole proposals is overcomplicated.

Now suppose that after providing liquidity and after many trades the liquidity balance is disproportionate. Suppose that at the beginning of our journey there were 10 bitcoin and 100,000 USD (100,000 / 10 = 10k per bitcoin) within our liquidity pool, and after several trades (and / or changes in price) the balance was disproportionate leaving 12 BTC and 90,000 USD (90,000 / 12 = 7.5k per bitcoin) This will cause an impermanent loss on all liquidity providers since the price shown would not be the real price of the asset, this is where the arbitrage traders take profit, since they will begin to trade in that pool until the price shown in the It reflects the real market price, eating into the liquidity of suppliers. The way to patch this up is by offering UNI holders the opportunity to be able to \u201coffer\u201d their assets directly to be put below the liquidity offered by liquidity providers. For example, the way to remedy the aforementioned example would be to add 30,000 USD of liquidity to the BTC-USD pair. Since the liquidity provided by UNI holders to the riskier part will be under the liquidity provided by LP, our assets should remain risk free. For example if I am a UNI holder and I have 500 links wich I have as an investment and I want to hold them. I can join the UNIfy ecosystem and help balancing the liquidity thus reducing arbitrage, thus increasing more liquidity provided into the exchange since most people don\u2019t offer liquidity because of this issue ",

Where there will be profit, people will always use that, thus always correcting itself to the centralized exchanges. This is due to a simple reason, say you have coin A that you can buy for 0.10$ on this dex that you can access only by \u201cstaking uni\u201d. However on binance, this same coin is worth 0.20$, I would definitely purchase as many as I can on the dex and sell them off on binance. And if we are being honest, you would probably do the same too. While all well and good in theory to remove the arbitrage trading bots, you would still have the tools to analyze these markets and thus alert arbitrage traders to these opportunities. However I must also state, arbitrage traders is not necessarily a bad thing. This is because there should be a unified price for all of the tokens, and having arbitrage traders allows all prices to correct themselves. As for the cashout token, it will eventually reach 0$ in value unfortunately, even if you pay it out in USDT or whatever, you cannot create liquidity out of thin air. As for implementing the Aave platform onto uniswap, that is a great concept. It would allow more liquidity to flow through uniswap, and ideally increase the value of the UNI token.

This might be a misunderstood, the token3 will be an intern token to measure the rewards earn by each UNI holder, this token will be issued according to the rewards of the liquidity provided at stage2 (For example if I am a bitcoin whale and I have tons of USD, I buy UNI to enter the ecosystem, and then at stage 2 (token2) I provide that liquidity to be used as a lending service, trading, or even to other dexchanges, applications are almost infinite, this activity is the one that will provide the rewards at stage3 (token3) Thanks and if you also have something to add I am happy to keep talking with you ",

Liquidity depth is the main value Uniswap provides, you can\u2019t trim it in any shape or form without substantially hurting its worth. Ideally you want to have 50x+ liquidity of your next competitor, and that is only possible with total inclusivity and ease of use. Exactly as it is today.

If arbitrage trading will be benefit to exchanges, don\u2019t you think Binance will allow it?   First of all, arbitragers are on all exchanges. Basically arbitraging is buying something at a certain price on an exchange and selling it at a profitable price on another exchange. So if on Binance the price of ETH is 350$ and on UniSwap the price is 345$, an arbitrager will buy ETH on UniSwap and sell it on Binance. If the price was higher on UniSwap he would\u2019ve done the opposite thing. This is an arbitrage trade between UniSwap and Binance. Arbitragers bring value to the exchanges because they pay fees and they help stabilize the prices. Arbitragers have nothing to do with impermanent loss. I don\u2019t know why you think they \u201cextract liquidity\u201d from our LP. Impermanent loss is due to a change in the market price of an asset. It can be calculated as: impermanent_loss = 2 * sqrt(price_ratio) / (1+price_ratio) - 1 Where price_ratio is the ratio between the actual price for a pair and the price at which the liquidity provider added liquidity to that pair.
