And we can also agree that most people don\u2019t have the ability to ride the innovation \u201cwave\u201d or even identify the next future wave. If we can agree on those two statements, then we can also agree that a Maker Marketing Core Unit is desperately needed. One of the main reason a Marcom CU is needed, its because the world is awash in innovative products, services, technologies, solutions, business models, etc.\u2014today.  Not just USDC, and others\u2014but innovative platforms that make the customer experience simple and convenient throughout the world, especially in first-world countries. New innovations like DAI must be brought to market and commercialized in order to generate revenue and profit.  Innovation alone cannot sustain a company\u2014it must be paired with marketing. As an example, when the mosaic we browser was invented\u2014folks that lived in the present thought that AT&T and other telecoms were going to develop the digital super highway. The same thing can be said when it comes to stablecoins. Those that live in the present will tell you that the Centrals Banks will dominate stablecoin issuance. Living in the present is where we are today\u2014we are living in the present and not the future by signaling that a marketing team is not needed, nor important\u2014by occupying the same markets as others. It is inherently important IMO\u2014that we escape the present and live in the future. It\u2019s one thing to ride the \u201cwave\u201d it\u2019s another thing to have a radically innovative product that lives in the future. Marketing is about connecting the right customers to the right product.  Marketing helps sales teams, and the people throughout the core of a business. Marketing involves considering and addressing the entire customer experience. It provides the right context for people to understand the innovation of what exactly is DAI\u2014and it helps identify new partners and channels necessary to engage with customers. I urge you to please vote YES, and add the Strategic Marcomms Core Unit. Thank you for reading and Voting, -Frank Cruz Flip Flop Delegate LLC ",
