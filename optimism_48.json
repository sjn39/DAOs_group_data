I propose a few tags and categories: For Airdrop and Feedback tags:  Earndrop or Benefitdrop Ideas (\u201cAirdrop\u201d word was edited) Governance feedback OP token usage Forum coordination  New Category: Rules not Followed This category is to avoid the removal of any post but to give a direct response to proposals not following the rules. This will certainly redirect efforts to ether proposals and avoid misconducts like Cobie\u2019s proposal promoting violence (even if it is as a parody). New Category: Public Goods This category will be one of my personal favorites where projects oriented to public goods can display ideas and promote the use of op tokens. Get feedback from the community and thrive as our most active category if this is where we are heading. I know there\u2019s a lot more filtering to do if someone comes up with a good idea I\u2019ll edit this post to include it and tag the author. ",

By implication, to most, it implies - free tokens.  Maybe that\u2019s not bad when as we try to grow usage, but I think the name must change.  If anyone agrees with me could we start a discussion to explore the ideas of others?  To me, earndrop or benefitdrop or drops-with-benefits or \u2026 If there is enough interest, someone will come up with a better name and process.  Thanks, John BTW, I agree with the idea. ",
