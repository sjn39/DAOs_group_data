                    "content": "Hello all, I wanted to share the plans for the governance calendar at Maker over the Winter break / holiday period. We don\u2019t believe it is worthwhile to proceed with non-emergency governance processes over this period given that everyone involved would rather be doing more festive activities. These dates reference the Monday beginning the week. Please leave any questions or comments below. @prose11 @Derek for visibility and possible comments.  Weekly Governance Cycle Week Beginning 15th November - Normal Coverage Week Beginning 22nd November - Normal Coverage Week Beginning 29th November - Normal Coverage Week Beginning 6th December - Normal Coverage Week Beginning 13th December - Weekly polls, but no executive proposal. Week Beginning 20th December - No weekly polls, no executive proposal, no governance and risk call. Week Beginning 27th December - No weekly polls, no executive proposal, no governance and risk call. Week Beginning 3rd January - No weekly polls, possible executive proposal. Week Beginning 10th January - Normal Coverage resumes. This means that the last executive vote of 2021 will likely take place on December 10th unless for whatever reason, there isn\u2019t enough content to make it worthwhile. The last governance and risk call of 2021 will take place on December 16th.   Monthly Governance Cycle As per MIP51c4: Calendar Exceptions there will be no monthly governance cycle in the month of December.  An exception may be made to the above for the recently posted budget subproposal regarding Oracle Gas Costs. We will provide clarity around this as soon as possible.  ",
