                    "content": "Disclaimer \u2013 This post is meant to be informational and for discussion. You should discuss any legal questions you have about the MakerDAO ecosystem or any other legal issues with your counsel. I had not seen any other posts on the matter and thought that other community members might also be curious to know more on the status of the \u201cBlack Thursday\u201d litigation against the Maker Foundation and other entities. Looking through the public docket, there were two recent points of interest that I wanted to flag for the community. First , in June of this year, plaintiffs moved to re-open the US district court (federal-level trial court) case, which had been stayed pending arbitration. The motion was based on the arbitration panel\u2019s May 16th ruling:     AAA:  The Panel finds that the Claimant\u2019s claims fall outside the scope of the 2018 Terms of Service because those claims relate to Claimant\u2019s use of services under a subsequent digital platform that was governed by the 2019 Terms of Service. Therefore, this matter is not arbitrable under the 2018 Terms of Service.   https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmf5K8emF7qxSZbAGZuwK18m8uKerf4b6dAFm97dq7g8ud?filename=Maker%20re-opened%20case.pdf Second , Plaintiffs received permission to file a Second Amended Complaint (draft here). A few notes on that. The Dai Foundation has been dropped from the complaint. The remaining named defendants are Maker Ecosystem Growth Holdings, Inc. n/k/a Metronym, Inc. and Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation. Paragraphs 5 and 6 further describe the defendants:     Complaint:  The Maker Ecosystem Growth Holdings, Inc. (\u201cMaker Growth\u201d) is a foreign company (organized and operating under the laws of the Cayman Islands), with its primary place of business in California. On information and belief, Maker Growth has recently renamed itself as, Metronym, Inc. (\u201cMetronym\u201d). Metronym has stepped into the shoes of Maker Growth and assumed its business assets and liabilities. Metronym, like Maker Growth is a foreign company (organized and operating under the laws of the Cayman Islands). For purposes of this Complaint, Maker Ecosystem Growth Holdings, Inc. is referred to as Metronym or Maker Growth. But in each instance, all references are to the current, active corporate entity previously known and operated as Maker Ecosystem Growth Holdings, Inc. Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation is a foreign company (organized and operating under the laws of the Cayman Islands), with its primary place of business in California. On information and belief, Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation is an affiliate of Maker Growth and overlaps in the management, operation, and development of the Maker Protocol (defined below) and its related ecosystem. On information and belief, Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation has recently dissolved.   Plaintiff is seeking class certification to represent all vault holders who lost money. The causes of action remain the same as the initial complaint, and first amended complaint, i.e., Negligence, Intentional Misrepresentation, and Negligent Misrepresentation. Again, I want to stress that I\u2019m not offering any advice or assessment of the strength of the complaint or outcomes. I will remind anyone reading these that anyone can file a complaint, and the allegations aren\u2019t necessarily supported with any evidence (though lawyers can get in trouble if they make representations they know are false). This will be an interesting case to watch. Long term, it could set some precedent for Foundation liability for DAO actions, successor liability, and potentially the scope of permissible equitable relief, depending on the scope of the defendants token holdings.
