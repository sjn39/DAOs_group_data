Instead of creating a new thread, we can repurpose this one given there were already some comments here. We can use this to discuss things like:  What should be the main priority/priorities for the upgrade; When, roughly, should we aim for the upgrade to happen, and the tradeoffs of including a marginal feature vs. delaying; How to split multi-upgrade features across >1 upgrade, and the implications of including a subset of those features in a specific upgrade   Current EIP proposals (Mar 15, 2023): In order of apparition on this thread, note that EIP-4844 is already included in the upgrade:  SELFDESTRUCT removal (4758, 6046, 6190, etc.) EIP-663 EIP-5920 EIP-1153 EIP-2537 EIP-4788 EVMMAX EIP-5843 EIP-6601 & EIP-6690  SSZ changes:  EIP-6493 SSZ signature scheme EIP-6465 withdrawals_root  EIP-6404 / EIP-6466 transactions_root + withdrawals_root     Note: EIP champions who\u2019d like to propose their EIP for Cancun should add the cancun-candidate tag to a post about the EIP on this forum.   Original Post (Dec '22)   Click to expand Similarly to what we did for Shanghai, I propose using this thread to discuss how we should go about choosing EIPs for the post-Shanghai EL upgrade, Cancun. At the very least, EIPs which wish to be considered for the upgrade should add the cancun-candidate to either their existing EthMagicians topics, or create a new one focused on Cancun consideration.

EOF provides that trivially, so it\u2019s fair to say that with EOF 663\u2019s issues become resolved. It\u2019s supported by Solidity, Vyper and Huff, the main direct users of 663. I need to check with Fe as well, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be against because they currently compile to Yul which would benefit from this. With 663:  All languages can save gas by not moving local variables to memory when they don\u2019t fit on the reachable part of the stack anymore. Solidity specifically can cut a big chunk of its roadmap short. The item of \u201csolving stack-too-deep errors\u201d, which include complex optimizers and transformations would simply be done. This also benefits any other language that wishes to optimize local variables by always keeping them on the stack. This consequently brings security advantages by avoiding complex compiler behavior.  If EOF goes in Shanghai, I don\u2019t think it would be possible to add 663 as well. If EOF goes in Cancun, I think there would be time to add 663 as well given the time until then and how simple it is. ",

Some opinions my own and some the Besu team\u2019s:  Priorities should be EOF and 4844, (and whatever consensus we reach on SELFDESTRUCT). The EIP grab-bag approach from Shanghai, while useful, should be limited if we can. There are often many details that come up during the implementation phase and I think it would be best to avoid creep on this already large fork. I think the progress on 4844 in the workshop should drive a timeline. We initially dubbed this a fast-follow fork, which sounds like early 2H. With Shanghai, timelines are dictated by our need to ship withdrawals. While we can accumulate some tech-debt in Shanghai for withdrawals as we have a chance to correct it in Cancun, more pervasive protocol changes in 4844 and EOF will be quickly enshrined tools, langs, and live contracts. To this end, delays are more prudent than shipping \u201csomething,\u201d especially with EOF and EVM version requiring support in clients and languages. I have no preference on this - protocol schedules are flexible. We can ship code that lives dormant for a while on Mainnet while we iron it out elsewhere. Weakly in favor of ship often, test often approach.  Matt ",

I think this is a failure of prioritization that deserves more discussion. I\u2019d suggest this time around not committing to anything else (other than EIP-4844) for which the spec is not finalized, and EOF is still figuring out parts of the spec (e.g. just a week ago DELEGATECALL into legacy code was brought up).
