If you are unfamiliar with this topic of discussion I encourage you to read/watch the following resources:     Global Settlement of Single Collateral Dai Governance       Hi all,  I\u2019ve aggregated recent RocketChat comments with the aim of promoting discussion to clarify how we will shutdown SCD. I\u2019ve referred to the action of shutting down SCD as Global Settlement because it is a planned process with a date and defined parameters that need to be collectively agreed and voted upon.  For this process to be complete, we can think of the SAI debt ceiling as essentially being reduced to zero. However, before this occurs there are some nuances that need to be defined, \u2026         Global Settlement of Single Collateral Dai Governance       Hi all,  Thank you for the great questions and contributions. I\u2019ve tried to add further notes to answer where I can. Note, we still need to review all of this with the risk team for a more comprehensive analysis, please do not consider this in anyway definitive - let\u2019s chat on tomorrow\u2019s Governance call!  Additional tax details:   Tax accrues based on the accumulated debt (Sai). You can think of this in the same way as the Stability Fee accumulating in MCD. Tax is paid to PETH holders, whereas t\u2026         Summary/Discussion of Parameters for SCD Shutdown Governance       The results are in!  After weeks of discussion and voting, I have closed the final signal polls for SCD Shutdown. To recap, with the community currently trying to maintain 2 separate Dai credit systems, I thought it imperative to begin the process of collecting opinion on when we should shut down the legacy system. Especially since there seemed to be a lack of consensus on the issue. This led me to begin with a signal on \u201cWhen should we trigger SCD Global Shutdown\u201d.    With this first signal I a\u2026          With these resources you should start to see the picture that is emerging on the decisions that need to be made in regards to SCD Shutdown. With that being said, I believe it is important to gather signal on whether the community even wants the ability to recuperate the outstanding stability fees using the tax function, or would prefer to forgive or find another solution entirely. Questions you should think about before voting:  Are we ok with all CDPs being taxed the same regardless of their current stability fee %? What is the game theory behind these decisions? (PETH/ETH) Are there other ways we can get CDPs to migrate/close? How should we best communicate our intentions to CDP holders? Will the broader community be upset by these circumstances? Should we worry? Are we willing to forgive a certain amount of stability fees? (~$2 Million of SCD fees outstanding) If we forgave stability fees would CDPs that already migrated be upset? Should we worry? If a tax is implemented, should we worry about a Sai liquidity crunch in the event CDPs want to all pay back at the same time?  Should we implement the tax function near the end of a planned SCD Shutdown in order to extract fees from remaining CDP holders? Please discuss below! If you have any concerns with wording / format / or content, please let me know. I tried to be as unbiased as possible. Edit: Due to the possible implications of this poll, some community members have determined that it may be unsafe to signal the results of this poll at this time. With that in mind, we have decided to postpone the poll until we can decide on an optimal game theoretic next step. ",

At first I viewed this purely as a way to re-coup fees to MKR holders, but I now think it should viewed as a way to prevent abuse of the system. If we leave things as-is and announce a shutdown date of say July 1st. From now until July 1st you are giving people a way to mint SAI at 0% interest. Furthermore the minted SAI could  then be moved through the migration contract to earn the DSR. Free money. This is completely undesirable behaviour. The only mechanism I can come up with to counter this is to prevent minting of SAI by setting the debt ceiling to 0 which may have some other adverse effects. I would encourage everyone to think of the game theoretic full picture of this rather than just \u201cshould we punish the CDP holders or not?\u201d. ",

                    "content": "I\u2019ll attempt to lay out my arguments here as to why I\u2019m against this tax.  First and foremost, this issue is only coming up because of the way SCD was designed, whether it was an accidental oversight or an intentional trade-off against some other criteria, it doesn\u2019t really matter. The point is we ( technically the Foundation but outside of this community I would suggest most don\u2019t see a distinction ) are responsible for this situation. If we implement a tax, then some percentage of CDP Holders are going to end up paying that tax. Game theoretically, this percentage should be low. The only reason people would get hit by this is if they\u2019re completely oblivious to crypto news/announcements etc over whatever timescale we announce the shutdown. The issue is that we are punishing these users for a problem that is not their fault. One can argue that \u2018they should have been paying attention\u2019 and there is an element of truth to this, but I think it is important to consider why these people may not be paying attention. I would argue it is one of the following:  They\u2019ve lost interest in crypto to the point they are willing to abandon the value in their CDP. They are taking a break from crypto and trust the Maker Protocol not to screw them over in their absence. They are for some reason unable to spend their time actively engaging with crypto news / announcements etc.  Now for point 1, we have no problem. However for point 2 and 3 we are fucking these people over in order to fix a problem that we created. This is unacceptable. Under SCD, fees were only to be paid when a CDP is closed. If you had a very low liquidation price, you might well have stopped paying attention safe in the knowledge that fees would not be due until you closed your CDP, by implementing the tax we are breaking that implicit promise.  Secondly, if everyone has to close their CDPs by a certain date or else get hit with a huge tax, it will cause a liquidity crunch for SAI. As soon as we announce the tax, there is a reason for everyone to buy and hold as much SAI as they can acquire for under $1 and sell it once the liquidity crunch hits and SAI is trading well above a dollar. Well! You may say, if SAI is trading above a dollar, we\u2019ll just emergency shutdown early. But doing that would defeat the entire purpose of the tax and would mean that we\u2019d have to go against the timeline we had already loudly announced. Cue huge backlash to absolutely no gain. (We still won\u2019t see the fees because we\u2019ll be forced to shutdown long before the tax hits.)  Thirdly, the optics of this look terrible. I\u2019m still not sure that I 100% understand the game theory around the tax,  if it\u2019s that complicated then no one outside out community is going to make the effort to bother. Instead they will assume that we are:  Charging people twice for SCD because we are greedy. Making other people pay for the flawed design of SCD. Forcing people to migrate because we can\u2019t be bothered to manage both systems.  This has the potential to harm the future income from MCD.  Fourthly, if we screw over CDP Holders in this way, there is a chance that they will be less inclined to take advantage of using  MCD for leverage in the future.  Fifthly, the tax is not equitable. This is also horrible optics, and despite the game-theoretical fact that it should not apply to most users, you can bet that there will be a massive uproar from the people that understand the tax well enough to realise this.  Sixthly, there is unlikely to be SAI in the migration contract for this period, at least there certainly won\u2019t be enough for everyone to migrate, which means we are not even forcing SAI CDP Holders to migrate, we are forcing them to close their positions and re-open them, potentially incurring taxable events.  In conclusion, this is an occasion where we should accept defeat. We cannot claim those fees without causing ourselves a whole bunch of damage. The CDP Holders that have held out until now have won. There will be plenty more fees to burn under MCD, we should cut our losses on the SCD fees and take a less dangerous path. In my view the less dangerous path is the following:  Sai Debt Ceiling -> 0 ( Prevents more Sai being minted. ) Sai Stability Fee -> 0% (Irrelevant at this point since we aren\u2019t going to see the fees.) Set a date for Shutdown some months in the future. (We don\u2019t want to be paying money to the DSR for Dai locked in the migration contract indefinitely.) Make sure that MCD continues to be net-positive over the months until SCD Shutdown (Sai locked in the migration contract can accrue the DSR without paying the stability fee.)  ",

Would it be technically possible to set the tax such that it is either (a) too high for every user or (b) overall higher than the fees owed and then, using Maker surplus, make whole every overpaying address? If yes, should Maker poll-vote on a promise to redirect some of the MCD surplus towards making those users whole?

Those who migrated early with the understanding that Maker would somehow recoup the SCD fees anyway will see that they could have stayed in SCD the entire time.   The differences are thus:  We aren\u2019t directly taking anything from the people that migrated as expected. We aren\u2019t breaking implicit promises made to the people that migrated as expected. Those users actively made a choice to migrate, meaning they share the responsibility for that migration.  It\u2019s true that those users may be jealous or regret that they didn\u2019t make the same high-risk high-reward decision as someone else who stuck with SCD. But ultimately this was their choice. We won\u2019t have deprived them of something they have, but only something they could have had if they\u2019d made different decisions. I suspect the sentiment from these users will average out at something along the lines of: \u201cAh damn, I should have stuck it out, those bastards still in SCD must have had some serious balls to risk the liquidity crunch and shutdown.\u201d As opposed to people that get hit by the tax going: \u201cThose bastards at MakerDAO took my Ether away when I wasn\u2019t looking.\u201d     swakya:  Would it be technically possible to set the tax such that it is either (a) too high for every user or (b) overall higher than the fees owed and then, using Maker surplus, make whole every overpaying address?

To echo what LFW said:  2M in fees is nothing in the long run. We can easily recoup that if we get CDPs like 3088 to come back and create vaults in the future. the negative optics/press. Consider reading this headline on coindesk as someone who knows very little about DAI \u201cMaker implements 3000% tax on unpaid positions!!\u201d Would you want to use this system? I wouldn\u2019t. We should avoid this headline from happening and call GS.      flipflopflapdelegate:  Since the SAI Debt Ceiling will be going to an Executive Vote tomorrow at 45M\u2014is there any way we can lower it to 27M instead?   Great point. We don\u2019t want people to mint SAI, migrate it, and then deposit into DSR to get a rate arbitrage if they know we aren\u2019t doing a tax. Looking forward to hearing more about what we can do about this. Maybe do GS sooner to avoid much undesired arbitrage. ",

Yesterday, @hexonaut came up with the solution of keeping track of the stability fee starting today and making this the tax at global settlement. With this solution, no CDPs would be punished for opening before today while at the same time ensuring that CDPs are still penalized/charged for not closing before GS. Before coming up with this idea, the main arguments against using tax were that it would be punishing CDPs equally when some have much lower SF % than others. CDP users that haven\u2019t been paying attention to governance and trust the system to have their best interests would not be punished for it. In effect this would be forgiving previous stability fees for users that still choose to wait until global settlement. From here we would have to determine from what date makes the most sense to start calculating from. I said starting today above as an example but this could be anywhere from last year to once communications go out or on-chain polling passes. We should seek consensus on this parameter. With that being said we also need to determine if this is a popular option to begin with. Perhaps a majority of the community/MKR tokens wants to still tax everyone equally to the max, or maybe they want to just forgive all debts and get settlement over with. We\u2019ll have to seek consensus on this as well. As of right now, here are the shutdown options we have as I see (thanks @swakya) :  Lower DC, shutdown in 6 months, forgive all fee debt -> nothing to add Swap Fee for Tax, shutdown in 6 months, forgive debt from before migration (or starting as soon as agreed upon) -> Maker forgoes past accrued SF but this reestablishes correct incentives for CDP holders Shutdown in 6 months, flash tax at the end, no debt forgiveness -> not the same as #2 since flash tax would not be relative to CDP age at all Lower DC, keep managing the system, close when one of the parameters is hit (6 months, 10M supply, .05 peg deviation) -> No debt forgiveness and no trying to recuperate fees through tax Lower DC, manage system for 6 months, stop supporting after 6 months, let collapse on its own, determine GS sometime in the future. -> Gives CDPs time to get affairs in order then they\u2019re on their own.  **Edited 2. & 3. per @hexonaut 's post. Hopefully we can have some meaningful discussion on these options and then we can open a poll with the options that make sense and can come to some form of consensus. Let me know your thoughts.

If I have to choose, then I want to piss off the people that don\u2019t pay attention or are trying to get out of paying the fees that make the system work.   The people that will be affected by the tax are not all bad / lazy actors. Remember that some Sai has been irrecoverably lost, everyone can\u2019t close their Sai CDPs, and that others may have good reason to not be giving this their active attention. Using the Tax parameter will cost some people more than the Stability Fee they currently owe. This is the Maker Protocol taking their money by breaking its own rules when they have done nothing wrong (because the tax will definitely catch some innocents that aren\u2019t paying attention / can\u2019t source Sai). This is objectively worse than the Maker Protocol taking your money because you (and it) followed the rules as they were defined. Yes, some bad actors will \u2018get away with it\u2019 if we don\u2019t implement tax. That sucks, but it doesn\u2019t mean that we should screw over the innocent to punish the guilty. I am near certain that doing so would be worse for MKR Holders in the long term. Furthermore, how pissed are you really going to be because someone else broke the rules and through some messed up game theory got some free leverage? You haven\u2019t lost anything other than money you could have had if you\u2019d acted differently in some \u2018what-if\u2019 universe. In this situation you\u2019ve lost nothing you hadn\u2019t expected to lose. Someone else has gained something that you haven\u2019t gained, but you are not worse off than you expected.

                    "content": "Here is a list of the most likely scenarios we have going forward. Please let me know if my proposals are flawed in any way and also your thoughts and opinions on them. You may notice some repetition within the explanations. I am just trying to fully articulate to all readers the implications of each scenario. After some discussion, I plan to create a poll after the governance meeting on Thursday, January 30th. 1. Lower DC, close when one of the parameters is hit (6 months, 10M supply, .05 peg deviation) Explanation Easiest plan logistically. Debt ceiling must be lowered to 0 in order to prevent system exploitation. This strategy is in line with the progression of signal requests in the past month in regards to determining proper shutdown parameters. A summary of this topic can be found here: Summary/Discussion of Parameters for SCD Shutdown Maker community could still try and maintain peg through stability fee voting for good actors but it would be unclear how effective this would be, knowing CDPs can just wait to settle at GS and not pay any fees, peg may break. Example MKR holders vote to lower debt ceiling to 0. On-chain poll is crafted to include threshold parameters. On-chain poll passes, signalling governance facilitators intention to generate an executive vote for GS once any of the threshold parameters are crossed. MKR holders then vote to execute when available. CDPs wanting access to collateral during this time period will still owe stability fees. CDPs that wait until GS will be settled at the current oracle price of ETH/USD and will not owe any outstanding fees. Pros/Cons  Community has clearly defined shutdown parameters MKR holders gain to lose the most potential stability fees CDPs can wait until GS to claim interest free leverage No new Sai can be minted during this time period Possible liquidity issues  2. Swap `Fee` for `Tax` , shutdown in **x** months Explanation It is known that at global settlement, CDP users who wait until then will not have to pay their owing stability fees. In a strategy to circumvent this from happening, Maker governance could vote to swap the Fee function for the Tax function. This would ensure that CDPs would be charged whatever % the Tax amount ends up being. More details on how the Tax function works can be found here: Global Settlement of Single Collateral Dai Implications of this method are that CDPs would have no incentive to pay off their debt because doing so would incur past stability fees along with current tax fees instead of waiting until the end where they would just pay tax. There may be reasons they would want access to their collateral before then however so it is not a sure outcome. Example MKR holders vote to implement tax February 1st. Shutdown is voted to initiate on August 1st. CDPs who pay back between this window would still owe the equivalent % of stability fees outstanding and any taxes accrued after February 1st. CDPs that wait until GS will only owe the taxes. Pros/Cons  Shutdown date is known (certainty) Debt Ceiling doesn\u2019t have to go to 0 (more liquidity) CDPs are incentivized to pay back before implementation (SF) or wait until GS (Tax) CDPs are disincentivized to pay back before GS (SF+Tax) Requires communication of changes to community. Public Relations Issues  3. Shutdown in x months, flash `tax` at the end Explanation With this method, CDPs would still accrue stability fees like normal until global settlement. In the week before GS initiates, MKR holders would vote to swap fee for tax and proceed to hike the tax rate to a high % to be equivalent with what the stability fee would have been during this time frame. Tax % would be a blanket amount, so governance would have to determine what a \u201cfair\u201d % would be. If properly communicated to CDP holders and the broader crypto community, CDPs would understand that they would not be able to escape paying their fees and be incentivized to close before GS. Example MKR holders vote to initiate GS August 1st. 4 days before GS, MKR holders vote to swap fee for \u2018tax`. MKR holders vote to increase the tax %1000, so over 4 days APR fee would be 11%. GS initiates and remaining CDPs are automatically settled with 11% being taken off and added to burn PETH, thus diluting their claimable ETH amount. Pros/Cons  Shutdown date is known (certainty) Debt Ceiling doesn\u2019t have to go to 0 (more liquidity) CDPs still accumulate SF until GS Tax hits all CDPs equally, regardless of age CDPs are incentivized to close before GS Must be communicated effectively to community for PR reasons  4. Shutdown in x months, communicate an imaginary `fee` / `tax` swap, flash `tax` at the end Explanation This is a hybrid of option 2 and 3. Option 2 swaps fee for tax right away but the consequence of doing so is that from thereon out no MKR would be burned through fees. In this proposal we would be starting the counter on tax on a set date in the future but wouldn\u2019t enact it until several days before global settlement (option 3). Through this proposal stability fees can still accrue and CDPs that want to migrate/close in this time frame can do so by burning MKR. Otherwise they can dilute PETH/ETH through tax at the end for the equivalent SF %. Example MKR holders vote to initiate GS August 1st. Maker Foundation/Community conveys the start date of tax beginning February 1st. Community members keep track of current SCD SF and 4 days before August 1st calculate over the past 6 months what the equivalent tax would be. MKR holders vote to change fee to tax July 28th. Say SF was 8% for 6 months. Tax equivalent over 4 days would be 365% APR. MKR holders would vote to raise tax to 365%. August 1st GS would initiate. All CDPs closed between February 1st and July 28th would have all previously accrued fees as well as fees from the final 6 months to pay while all CDPs closed at GS would be taxed a flat 4%. Pros/Cons  Shutdown date is known (certainty) Debt Ceiling doesn\u2019t have to go to 0 (more liquidity) CDPs still accumulate SF until GS Tax starts from specified date. CDPs are incentivized to close before GS Requires the most communication Has the potential to capture the most stability fees Requires the most governance overhead  5. Lower DC, manage system for 6 months, stop supporting after 6 months, let collapse on its own, determine GS sometime in the future. Explanation Lowest overhead while still having the best chance of recovering unpaid stability fees. This method would signal that while it has been MKR holders duty to maintain the SCD system, we have given ample time for CDP users to migrate. We would promise to maintain the system for several more months before letting the system run its course until an unknown time when chaos has overtaken and we have no choice but to close down. This proposal is similar to option 1 but we would not close if the peg breaks or supply dwindles. Essentially it would no longer be our problem. This would give us the longest opportunity to let CDP holders migrate/close down on their own and allow MKR holders to capture more potential fees. Other considerations would be to keep the debt ceiling higher for market makers and liquidity providers to help maintain the system. Pros/Cons  Shutdown date is unknown (uncertainty) Debt Ceiling must go to 0 or be below Sai supply (less liquidity) CDPs still accumulate SF until GS Lowest governance overhead CDPs are incentivized to close before GS Peg may destabilize General liquidity issues possible PR implications unknown  Glossary of terms GS - Global Settlement (Emergency Shutdown) - https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/emergency-shutdown CDP - Collateralized Debt Position - https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/cdp SCD - Single Collateral Dai Looking forward to discussion below.

When ES happens 1 Sai is redeemed for $1 of collateral. If everyone knows ES is coming then it doesn\u2019t make sense to buy Sai for greater than $1, and it makes quite a bit of sense to buy Sai below $1. This effect is stronger the closer and more certain the future emergency shutdown is deemed to be. I think that if we announce a date then we will not have too much trouble with the peg regardless of the debt ceiling setting. Unless we do something else that could trigger a liquidity crisis. We don\u2019t want to make Sai CDP holders afraid of Emergency Shutdown. If they think that ES is worse than buying Sai and closing their CDP then rush for Sai will cause the peg to break upward. ",

                    "content": "Probably option 1. I think the ES game theory will maintain the peg, especially given that there is no real need for users to migrate considering that the fees will be forgiven on shutdown. I also think we should announce a date sooner rather than later. I think it will put a lot of minds at ease. At least once a week someone asks when it\u2019s getting shutdown. Options 2, 3 and 4 involve us having to explain the tax parameter to the space, and convince people it\u2019s the right way forwards. Even if it weren\u2019t for the PR nightmare, I think we need to define what we are trying to achieve. Option 2 leads to most of the fees going to PETH holders, there is no incentive to pay both, so most users will hold until shutdown and pay the tax to PETH holders. Option 3 has the best chance of recovering the fees, Options 2 and 4 are middle-road options that I don\u2019t think are worth the cost of communicating tax. Option 4 has a weird outcome where depending on the currently owed stability fees for a CDP, each CDP is either incentivised to close before the tax starts, or wait for ES. Not sure this is good, as I said, middle of the road option, recovers some fees, less chance of a liquidity crunch, still need to explain the tax parameter to the space. Imo not worth the effort given that we aren\u2019t going to recover all of the fees. Options 2, 3 and 4 increase the chance of a liquidity crunch of Sai, forcing us to shutdown early anyway. Can you imagine going through the comms issue arround the tax, only to have the Sai price balloon into insanity as everyone tries to close, and we\u2019re forced to shutdown early after taking the tax PR hit. Worst of all worlds if that happens. No significant fee recovery, damaged credibility, much governance panic. Option 5 feels like abdicating all responsibility which I don\u2019t think it right considering the implicit promises made in the past. I don\u2019t want us to be in this grey area of \u2018oh, we haven\u2019t shut it down yet, but we don\u2019t support it either, it\u2019s just sort of there.\u2019 Even if we tell everyone we\u2019re not supporting it, people will still look to us when it breaks.

I have this feeling there are other options but we simply have not had them presented. I also wonder if it makes sense (or if people agree) that it seems the community favors the SAI holders vs. CDP creators in the GS or whether there are mechanisms that could be used to incentivise not just CDP holders but SAI holders to convert that we are missing. IF after the above is answered with no additional information or ideas and I am left with the choices posted by @Aaron_Bartsch I also would favor his (1) I think.  As I have a hard time doing analysis on the above scenarios due to lack of sufficient depth of understanding of the SCD mechanics I\u2019m going to defer to others with more knowledge on this topic. Last comments on regarding the migration.   So far I think it has gone quite smoothly and at or slightly faster than the pace I expected   I think IF MCD SF\u2019s rise and the DSR rises with it above 8% we should start to see some of the Nexo SAI deposits move to DAI and into the DSR.  In principle IF the DAI savings rate with DSR beats all the secondary markets (SAI/DAI saver carrot) we should see the maximum movement of SAI to DAI and this should provide liquidity for CDP closures.   This event should it unfold should give the Maker community a solid view on how much SAI is going to move via a reward vs. what will be left that will have to navigate the least punishment options. I don\u2019t see this as a - we need to collect the revenue issue - but more about being as fair and open as possible with the entire greater community (SAI and by proxy DAI savers, as well as SAI/DAI borrowers) and not just Maker holders. My .02DAI opinion to go with my few MKR that does vote on occasion. ",

There are so many people that are like close the SCD down now! The community has given enough time to CDP holders to close. Really? Honestly if I\u2019m a large CDP holder right now I\u2019m still waiting to see what this community is going to decide because it is starting to look like I\u2019m going to get out of my previously accumulated SF fees at a minimum.  We honestly don\u2019t know dink about the remaining CDP holders and I loath the idea that people who got out of the CDPs early by paying fees will basically feel screwed for doing what Maker considered \u2018right\u2019.   I want them to feel rewarded. People wonder why the SAI PEG is so robust. I think it is due to the bridge still being active with at least \u2018some liquidity\u2019 but this is speculation. I also think LFW concern over a SAI liquidity crunch is reasonable. Set the DC to zero and this may start to cause issues that could become impossible to manage and could float over to DAI. Lastly your comments above regarding \u2018what is the goal?\u2019 - I echo them all and add the questions above. One thing I really don\u2019t see being discussed is the following proposal that I will write from a PR perspective as an example. Maker today has decided today to do the following with the SCD.   Drop the DC continuously so that no more than 4% extra SAI liquidity can be minted at any given time.   SAI outstanding as of today is $25M and we are reducing the DC to $26M and will continue to lower it (dynamically if necessary or possible).  The SCD DC will not be going up.   Keep the SCD open indefinitely with the following caveat.   The SCD GS can occur at any time any of the following conditions are met.   SAI outanding below $10M,  the SAI PEG off by more than 5%, or longer than 6 months has passed.   There will be no announcement of a specific closure date and this can come at any time any of the above conditions are met.   While the SAI:DAI bridge remains open, fully bi-directional, and with a 1:1 exchange rate this can change at any time.   First to being a uni-directional bridge, and finally with a exchange rate that is different than 1:1   Expect that on shutdown that all CDPs that have not closed will have a fee via a tax applied that is intended equal or greater than the sum total of the SF fees because we want people who close their CDPs early to expect that they will end up paying less by closing early than waiting until the GS.   the SCD-SF fee will condintinue to rise at the rate of .5%/week or 2%/month until GS.   It is in the spirit of cooperation and open communication that we make the above announcement today regarding the status and future of the SCD.  We strongly urge SAI holders and in particular CDP holders to migrate.   This is the last call to SCD/SAI users/holders!  There will be no other warnings or PR regarding this issue until Maker decides to execute the Global Shutdown of the SCD system    We want to be clear at some point in the future the SCD will be shut down but the community has decided the \u2018exact\u2019 details of the shutdown will not be discussed or even decided until the event happens.   When I think about the gamability of the above by both sides of this (SAI holders and CDP creators) I honestly think the above IS the best option. Why?   Because if we hard cap the DC to no more than 4% above outstanding (and drop this only if the outstanding drops sufficiently) CDP holders will have no way to get money or at their collateral except by paying down their loans and migrating.    There really are no other options for them   And if they see that SCD-SF fees are rising. SAI holders basically are stuck waiting for potentially quite some time AND with significant PEG risk before they get anything in the GS.   The fact the bridge is put into this and that there is no \u2018formal\u2019 date for shutdown.   What exactly is there to game here except a possible liquidity crisis causing SAI price to rise above 1.    I am less worried about the SAI PEG going up because once 1.05 is hit this triggers possible GS action to just close it down.     The SAI PEG going down will mean CDPs can close at reduced cost and won\u2019t go below .95 anyway. Honestly if one said the SCD would stay open with increasing SF fees indefinitely and a DC that is going to do nothing but drop and a looming GS that has a community which has signalled it will apply a tax and the idea that this could go on for years.   I think the above would lead to enough uncertainty and mounting costs to drive people to exit SAI.    I also think if we can get the SF and hence the DSR to something north of 9% we should see another strong drive to exit the system.   The only people who are going to be left are ones that have lost keys, or are dead, or don\u2019t care.    Anyone else - well I read the Maker documents and if they claim they didn\u2019t know the hazards it is to me like someone saying they are ignorant of the law. Sorry if this is long but on second thinking on this.   I am honestly back to keeping the above alternative options to any of the other options presented on the SCD. ",

The best we could do is a loose, non-binding agreement to uphold these edicts. This is due to the nature of continuous voting and the way system parameters are controlled.

                    "content": "Off the top of my head response here on the easy parts and will have to mull over the more difficult parts.  Apologies for length.   Decide how the DC will be managed - make the DC downward management basically automatic so once we decide this we probably won\u2019t have to mess with it again in governance.    I was suggesting a 4% buffer putting the DC at $26M, cyrus was advocating $30M or a 5/25 approx 17% buffer - perhaps 10% is a good number (DC to 27.5M currently).   I think we all agree the SCD-DC needs to be pretty tight to the outstanding here to limit SAI minting but if we threaten at tax the exact headroom should be moot.  I think we want a tight reign on SAI minting at this point to be no more than 10% of the total outstanding.    I have been thinking we should just debate this in forums and when we here come to a consensus then put the value up for yes/no governance poll.   Vote that GS on the SCD happens according to the conditions laid out in (2) that I think we at least have some forum consensus on - or need to check again.    The point here is that this is a vote effectively to keep the SCD open for as long as possible to give everyone the chance to close out CDPs before the GS.   There will be no \u2018date\u2019 set other than one of the conditions is that after 6 months the SCD can close at any time at the discretion of Maker governance.   In fact the more I consider the 6 month \u2018condition\u2019 I think we should just remove that.   SCD stays open until $10M SAI is hit, or PEG is lost and then it closes as the pleasure or displeasure of Maker governance but not before.   This is to give more than enough time for people to show up and close.    One could argue that we could wait one more month before putting the SCD-SF rates into ramp mode to give everyone fair opportunity to close with the least cost.   Not at all sure how governance handles the Bridge mechanics.   Leave that for now.   If we are going to vote for something - There are only two pieces here.  Yes/no on levying a tax. And yes/no on the amount of the tax.   I think prudent here is the extra fee/tas being equal to the largest CDP debt to loan ratio so the cost to CDP holders to wait until GS is > then the accumulated SF fees.  Again best if we just get consensus in the forums about having a tax.   How much to levy to be discussed.    I want to be clear here - the message being sent to CDP holders stays consistent.   The earlier you move the more you will likely save.   Wait for the GS and all the old CDP holders will basically pay their accumulated SF + the fee, anyone who entered later will basically be punished more because the fee applies equally to everyone.  I want to leave the amount and mechanics of the tax at the end and a possible redemption still open to discussion.   Key point is that the message here to CDP holders is that they will not avoid their fees and if they wait for the GS they may face additional costs/fees so it is better to pay early than late.   Someone posted that we could have a kind of redemption system (manually executed) which would take the \u2018tax\u2019 or \u2018extra fee\u2019 and put this into a fund to try to balance out some of the GS fee/tax inbalance due to what I\u2019m proposing.   This one should be pretty easy - we debate the automatic SCD-SF increase rate %/month or %/week and start date of this ramp once and then just bundle the actual changes into governance.   Monthly/weeklyraises due to governance cadence might be more appropriate as I\u2019m not sure spells cast can actually implement automatic changes (for instance to ramp the SCD-SF X%/week, or to lower SCD-DC under condition X by amount Y) without contract/governance changes.   In my proposal here is what I would like to see clarity develop around.  The SCD will be shutdown - at some point!  Conditions needing to be fulfilled before the GS could be activated.  (If these conditions are not met the SCD should be open) SCD-SF on a steady and slow ramp up and always higher than the MCD ETH-A SF rate after some future date (3/1/2020 for example). That a tax > the accumulated SF fees will be applied across the board. 4a)  Whether or not there is a kind of rebate using the extra fees is done left unknown for now but under consideration. The DC is only going to go down and the available DC headroom will never be more than X% (say X=10)  What we want to keep unknown to some extent.  The exact value of the tax other than it will be > than the accumulated SF fees and be equally applied to all CDPs regardless of their age and ideally will be in amount so that even the older CDP pays > accumulated SF fees on their loans during the GS.   In effect what one wants to do is collect enough fees from the remaining CDPs outstanding to cover the SF on all the outstanding DAI all the way back to the oldest CDP that is reasonably large (say use CDP 3088 as the reference to determine what fees to charge everyone and then rebate the excess if possible to people who paid excessive fees at the end). There is no formal \u2018date\u2019 for shutdown only two conditions, outstanding SAI, PEG off by more than 5% for say a few days?! Whether the bridge will stay up, bi-directional, and 1 to 1 ratio until GS.  ",

                    "content": "I am strongly opposed to Option 1. My preference is currently for Option 3. Here are some dot points summarising my thoughts:   Good actors in the MakerDAO system who have converted their CDPs from SAI to DAI should be nurtured. They will be pissed off knowing that they would have been financially better staying in SAI all along. They will rightly be dubious of trusting MakerDAO into the future.   Option 1 sets up a precedence not to trust MakerDAO and that there is no punishment for behaving badly. It may even convince users that MakerDAO would never go through with an Emergency Shutdown to punish a bad actor. MakerDAO needs to set a precedence of being fair but tough when the requirement is there.   Option 3 provides a clear narrative that the earlier you transition to DAI, the greater the benefit will be. The narrative will be that smart actors will transition early and that stragglers will be cleaned up at the end in an emergency shutdown.   I am strongly in favour of having a set date of GS instead of a GS when \u2018one of x conditions are met\u2019. I believe that a large portion of CDP owners have preference to close their CDPs naturally and an early GS would cause confusion and may seem to some users like they have been scammed.   There would be a large portion of SAI CDP owners who intend to transition to DAI but have not done so due to laziness. If we communicate the conditions of the tax system and a date for GS, they will happily pay what they owe and transition across.   I believe lowering the debt ceiling to 0 is potentially destabilising and may trigger an early GS. This is very undesirable.   SAI CDP holders have been warned from the beginning that they are entering into a Beta system. They have been aware that they are paying fees to use the system. No one can rightfully be pissed off that after utilising the system to the very last moment at GS that they are charged what they owe (plus a penalty). There will be a small percentage of people who are unaware of the whole process. However, they will not lose anything more than what they should have paid in the first place.   Note that I strongly agree with @hexonaut that the tax is not about recouping fees for MKR holders, but penalising SAI CDP holders for abusing the system to the last moment.   I also have two questions, the answer to which might change my opinion. Question 1: Say for example that Option 3 is implemented with GS scheduled for July 1st 2020, User A has opened a SAI CDP on July 1st 2019. They put in 1 ETH and they have drawn 1 SAI. User B purchases 1 SAI on the open marketplace. At the point of GS, User A\u2019s CDP is Open and ETH is trading for USD100. What are User A and User B entitled to claim after GS? Question 2: I believe that Option 3 would have the effect of wanting to increase the peg of SAI above 1 as CDP owners search for SAI to close their CDPs. Does a 1:1 SAI:DAI bridge, game theoretically prevent the SAI peg from rising much higher than the DAI peg prior to GS? ie. If SAI is at 1.05 and DAI is at 1.00. Can a user print DAI convert to SAI, then sell for ETH and sell for a quick ~5% profit? edit1: fixed some erroneous uses of SAI vs. DAI. ",

                    "content": "Some additional thoughts on the gaming of the SCD here for some perspective.  Thanks to @mrabino1 @lix @LongForWisdom @Vishesh  for insightful discussion. A quick summary of the below is as follows:  Keeping the SCD open effectively with a tight DC limit effectively punishes both CDP and SAI users equally.   Closing the SCD rewards both participants as discusses below.    Restricting the DC to be very close to the outstanding means that CDP holders will not be able to extract value on their collateral and that the only way to access collateral between the 100-150% liquidation limit is effectively to pay down debt with SAI.   In fact since most CDP holders don\u2019t want to face liquidation they keep more collateral than the minimum and basically can\u2019t access the additional collateral above the 150% liquidation mark without risking liquidation.    In effect without the ability to mint more SAI on their debt CDP holders collateral is held hostage while the SCD is open and SAI SF fees + debt is not paid.   SAI holders while the SCD is open basically are facing greater and greater PEG risk.   Sure it could go above $1 (good for them and liquidity probably will show up to sell if the price is > 1.01).   What SAI holders are betting on here is the idea that after the GS SAI effectively becomes a non-expiring in time option contract on ETH at the SCD GS oracle price.    If the ETH USD price on the markets is < than this price everyone will keep their SAI which will be trading < $1 and not redeem for collateral at an effective loss.   IF the ETH USD price is > oracle SAI will trade > $1 and will exist as an option to redeem collateral in the future.   In the loosest sense then SAI becomes a new proxy on ETH and will trade against the GS oracle price above or below $1 depending on ETH USD price.   While the SCD is open there is no \u2018option\u2019 to redeem for ETH and the PEG hazard exposure if the GS happens the SAI PEG will float (and do this in rather ill-liquid markets btw) but then people basically can hold SAI to claim interest while waiting to exercise the price option.   So there will be a price gap between the actual redemption value and the premium (or lack there of) based on future price perceptions of the market.  During the GS basically all CDP holders get a free sell of their ETH collateral at the oracle price - without fee.   They then get access to all of their collateral above the $1 SAI borrowed for $1 ETH oracle price (within 3 days of the GS).   In effect the GS frees up at least 33% and probably much more ETH collateral for withdrawal without having to pay anything.   The other bonus is that SF fees are avoided if no tax is applied in this scenario which for some could be substantial.   The GS for CDP holders is basically a win for them.   During this time if the price of ETH trades below the GS oracle price they basically get the option to free their ETH at a discount.   If ETH trades above their collateral sells below market as SAI redeems (if it redeeems vs. waiting).  In summary it looks to me that the worst case for all parties involved here is to leave the SCD open as long as possible because then the SAI holders have to hazard PEG risk and don\u2019t get their ETH exchange option.   CDP holders face excess locked capital that they can\u2019t borrow against and have to face liquidation hazards.   IF the DC is kept tight and creeping downward, and the SCD-SF is steadily on the rise I think CDP holders over time are going to slowly pay their fees to free collateral because depending on the total fees every $1 SAI they pay frees up $2-$3 worth of ETH.   SAI holders facing PEG risk over time may also find reasons to migrate their SAI to DAI. As the summary suggests for both parties here keeping the SCD open is a worse case scenario for all parties than doing the GS. There has been a lot of discussion regarding the PEG. https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/governance-and-risk?msg=aPCSXDe9apESuksg6 While there are some scenarios above that reveal what could drive the SAI PEG off one I am thinking some real thoughts about the scenarios driving the PEG off and what mechanics could come into play to bring it back to $1 (or not) really need to be discussed here.   The PEG being off by 5% being one of the critical GS criterion I\u2019m suggesting and will follow up later as I am able to work on this.   I think the $10M outstanding is a reasonable debt point mostly because we have not seen any activity on CDP 3088 which has what 8.28M outstanding.    https://mkr.tools/cdp/3088 ",

                    "content": "I like your post The_Ratj and agree with your first point regarding Good actors.   I also think it may be a bit harsh to call the remaining that has not moved as \u2018bad actors\u2019 as we don\u2019t know the reasons people are holding opne CDPs.    The issue of semantics is important and avoiding derogatory terms for classes of people here is probably a good idea.   I mostly agree with all points except for wanting a fixed shutdown date. Anyway to try to answer your question (1).   User A on GS basically owes $1SAI + Tax presumably they will only be able to withdrawal $100-($1SAI + Tax) worth of ETH.    User B basically gets .01 or $1 worth of ETH.   PETH holders end up with the Tax difference. question (2):   Generally I think a lot of these options will have an effect on the PEG.   The whole issue with the bridge is that it has to have SAI liquidity for DAI to be able to arb.    My general reaction is that as long as there is liquidity the bridge will and does act as a PEG stabilizer.   Without liquidity it does nothing.    I\u2019m still mulling over PEG mechanics here.    PEG < $1 and borrowers get a discount to close provided they can find liquidity.  PEG > $1 and SAI holders come out to arb the price gap > $1.  The only issue here is whether the SAI holders value holding their SAI so that during the GS they effectively get a non-expiring price option on ETH collateral vs. the % price arb.    My thought here is that a substantail number of SAI holders like the idea of getting interest on their SAI and it becoming a ETH collateral option at the GS oracle strike price. In general I think before the GS this is going to cause the SAI price to rise > $1 and as long as there is SAI liquidity in the bridge or CDP holders can still mint some SAI there should be arb opportunities but in general thinking about this I think that the end game here is tilted in SAI holders favor, and against CDP holders to be able to close and this means we are going to see a rising SAI PEG.   This is going to depend on what bets people are going to make on the GS ETH oracle price during shutdown and whether people holding SAI think this will go up or down after the GS. It is the primary reason I think NOT putting a firm date on the GS but conditions that can trigger a GS is a better option for the community in the SCD GS shutdown game being played here. I am going to add as a SAI holder earning 8% in nexo I plan on holding some SAI (for better or worse) just to get that ETH exchange option and the sooner the GS happens the better.   If I thought Maker would just keep the SCD open, wind down the DC and steadily increase SCD-SF rates might I even consider taking out my SAI into a PEG > 1 event.    My reasoning here is that the value of SAI as a indefinite ETH option contract is FAR more valuable if I think the GS is happening soon than if I think it might not happen at all.   This would be particularly true if I can earn more than 8% elsewhere by converting that SAI to DAI and I am losing an oppportunity cost by waiting for a GS that might not happen for a year or more for me to be able to fully unlock the option value of SAI to ETH. Let me be clear here.   In my humble option:   The worst case for all SCD players is for the SCD to remain open with no firm GS date with a winding down DC and steadily rising SCD-SF fee rate and a looming GS tax should the GS ever be triggered.

Since this is a punishment as opposed to a benefit, we must be extremely careful not to penalize too much. Let me attempt to show why it is only possible to approximate a value for tax. This approximation could very easily tax far too much, which is why I\u2019m in support of option 1. Our desired result: a) global_tax_penalty_in_SAI = global_SF_owed_in_SAI I\u2019m using the global prefix because I want to get a rough idea. Each CDP would be taxed differently based on the amount they have borrowed, but for the sake of this argument, I\u2019m just going to calculate how much could potentially be penalized on a system wide level. since CDP holders (PETH holders with SAI borrowed against that PETH) are partially reimbursed with the tax, we need to account for how many borrowers have PETH vs the total supply of PETH from people who join the PETH pool without borrowing to receive the tax penalty. b) borrower_reimbursement_ratio = borrower_PETH / total_PETH the borrower_PETH is constant for this equation, but in reality it would vary for each individual CDP depending on how much debt each has borrowed. Again, this calculation is on a system wide level. c) tax_penalty_in_SAI = (tax_per_second * total_debt * seconds_until_shutdown) / borrower_reimbursement_ratio a few things: tax_per_second - the parameter governance votes on if we pick option 2, 3, or 4 total_debt - the SAI supply second_until_shutdown - depends on which option we pick Plotted out:  Screenshot from 2020-02-06 12-25-45417\u00d7763 24.7 KB  plot notes:  I had to substitute x for tax_per_second and y for borrower_reimbursement_ratio to get the plot to work. link to wolframalpha plot  I set the bounds for x to be between 1.00001\u20261.01. This depends on the value of second_until_shutdown, so this plot best resembles  \u201cflash tax at the end\u201d or option 3 since seconds_until_shutdown = 100 for this example. These are not real numbers and that is why the total_tax_in_sai maxes out to 4 billion. It didn\u2019t show up correctly in wolfram alpha if I used smaller numbers for tax_per_second  The bounds for reimbursement_ratio are 0.01\u20260.75. This is because there are 437k PETH in the pool as of today. If we announce that we are doing a tax then we can reasonably assume that ETH holders would join the PETH pool to get some of the tax fee. The key question I pose to anyone in support of option 2, 3, and 4  - how many ETH holders will join the PETH pool before shutdown? If this number is only 200k new ETH in the pool, then the reimbursement_ratio (assuming all 437k PETH have SAI borrowed against it) is: reimbursement_ratio = 437000 / (437000 + 200000) = .686 However, what if word gets out, and many more ETH holders join the PETH pool at the last possible moment. Let\u2019s say 8 M ETH join to get the free money taxed from CDP PETH. reimbursement_ratio = 437000 / (437000 + 8000000) = 0.0518   Looking back at the plot we see a huge difference in the level of punishment with a large reimbursement_ratio vs a small one. In summary, the more ETH holders that join the pool at the last moment = the more severe the punishment. As voters, we would need to guess how much ETH would join the PETH pool and set the tax_per_second parameter accordingly. Is it 400k ETH? Is it 4M ETH? We have no idea. That\u2019s why I\u2019m in support of option 1. As mentioned above, support for option 1 also means that I support lowering SAI DC to prevent people from migrating freshly minted SAI to DAI and putting it in DSR since we would be forgiving their SF.

Perhaps those who didn\u2019t/won\u2019t migrate shouldn\u2019t be called \u201cbad actors\u201d but the point is, it shouldn\u2019t be economically advantageous to put off migration to the last second. This sends a bad message to ecosystem participants for future migrations/incentive changes etc. It\u2019s not about sending additional money to MKR holders. If it would be helpful, the tax revenue can be sent to EF or similar, or just burned. ",

Tax revenue goes to PETH holders. Since anybody can trade ETH/PETH, a tax creates additional game theory complications around this market. We need to keep lowering the SAI debt ceiling and raising the SAI stability fee and hope that the SAI supply keeps going down. I think that much is uncontroversial. The exact end game is a mess. ",

Therefore, a new thread has been opened here:     Signal Thread: SCD Shutdown       With the extreme market changes we have seen in the past week, we have decided now would be a good time to once again engage in discussion about shutting down Single Collateral Dai.  During today\u2019s call, @Primoz and @Vishesh  presented information on the state of SCD. In summary of their findings it became apparent that peg instability and liquidity issues were beginning to hinder the efficiency of the protocol. Liquidations were no longer taking place in an ideal fashion due to cost inefficienc\u2026     Thank you all for participating in this thread. I hope to see you all in the next thread! ",
