I remember the idea before was to pay the interst in MKR and that MKR was burned, hence MKR was good investment if makerdao is widely used. Is the acrued interest in DAI used to buy MKR now and burn it or what is the dynamic now and why the changes? ",

See: https://makerburn.com/#/ Edit: some of the DAI is used to buy/burn MKR. So part of the DAI is instead used to pay for people working for MakerDAO (devs, governance, etc) and some part goes into a reserve (currently consisting of about 6m DAI). ",
