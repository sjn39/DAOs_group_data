A second MIP14 subproposal will be posted for the month of March. The new budget will be voted on in March and hopefully then take over the funding from April.  Reason Details This amount is a monthly cap of TechOps CU\u2019s new revised NewBase DAI budget. After submitting our 2023 budget to the community it was rejected for a number of reasons, including:  Very high budget overall \u2014 bad time for new hires and TechOps CU failing to judge the community\u2019s sentiment for cost cutting. Not giving Bear market vote options \u2014 as per MIP40 (only if the budget is higher) and as the new expected standard. Our role in Endgame \u2014 transitioning to Ecosystem Actor and/or Tribunal.  We\u2019ve taken this feedback onboard and have revised our new budget significantly which will be up for voting in March 2023. Due to budgeting cycle happening quarterly we\u2019re left without funding for February and March 2023. This amount will cover our expenses for the month of February. A second MIP14 subproposal will be posted for the month of March. Any excess funds as always will be promptly returned to the protocol.  Surplus Analysis Proposed transfer can be taken from the current surplus.  DAI Transfer Ceiling Analysis The proposed transfer is within the parameters of the DAI Transfer Ceiling (250,000 DAI).  Targets Recipient is TechOps CU Auditor Multi-sig Wallet. Recipient Address: 0x2dC0420A736D1F40893B9481D8968E4D7424bC0B Amount To Transfer: 138,894 DAI   Relevant Information:  2023 Revised DAI Budget MIP TechOps CU Mandate  ",

                    "content": "This is a summary of the contents of this subproposal and its impact, from GovAlpha\u2019s perspective:  This is a valid subproposal to request a DAI transfer from the Maker Protocol to a target Ethereum address, as defined in MIP14: Protocol DAI Transfer. So far, all MIP14 requests combined do not exceed the MIP14c4: Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling, which is currently set to 250,000 DAI. Therefore, this proposal is eligible. The last TECH-001\u2019s budget subproposal was not approved by Governance. Until a new budget can be submitted and voted on in March 2023, this request asks for 138,894 DAI to fund TECH-001\u2019s continuity work for the month of February. A second request to cover for the expenses of the month of March will be submitted. As per MIP14c2, transfer requests that exceed 100,000 DAI must fulfill a twelve-week Feedback Period and a four-week Frozen Period. However, as per [MIP2c2:  Interim Phase 2] (https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP2#MIP2c2) both periods can last one month unless otherwise noted as shorter. If this subproposal is ratified, 138,894 DAI will be transferred to the specified MIP47-compliant multisig wallet through the earliest executive vote. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  Disclaimer: These summaries are intended to be a guide and not a source of truth. You remain responsible for any actions you take on the grounds of this information. Please note the date when the summary was last updated to judge accuracy. Updated 2022-12-26 ",
