Contract addresses that contain version number in the URL (e.g.  https://changelog.makerdao.com/releases/mainnet/1.1.2/contracts.json ) might be deployed, but not in use.   The latest active contracts for the spells that have been cast, have the following static links:    Active Mainnet contracts -  https://changelog.makerdao.com/releases/mainnet/active/contracts.json   Active Mainnet release page -  https://changelog.makerdao.com/releases/mainnet/active/   Active Kovan contracts -  https://changelog.makerdao.com/releases/kovan/active/contracts.json   Active Kovan release page -  https://changelog.makerdao.com/releases/kovan/active/     It is advised that everyone that need to use the contracts, to import them using URLs from the point 3 (with the active word in the URL). In that case they will be updated automatically for the projects they are used for.  ",
