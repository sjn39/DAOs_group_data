If you\u2019d like to present, check out this thread. Agenda Intro by @JuanJuan  Lido - https://lido.fi/  MIP6: [stETH] - MIP6 Collateral Onboarding The Lido Protocol, built on Ethereum 2.0\u2019s beacon chain, allows users to earn staking rewards on the beacon chain without locking Ether or maintaining staking infrastructure. Lido allows users to deposit ETH and receive stETH. The deposited ETH is then pooled and staked with node operators selected by the Lido DAO. stETH represents the user\u2019s staked ETH balance of the beacon chain along with staking rewards accrued or penalties inflicted on validators in the beacon chain. When transactions are enabled on the beacon chain, stETH can be redeemed for unstaked ETH and accumulated rewards. Unlike beacon chain ETH, stETH can be freely transferred and traded. Onboarding stETH to MakerDAO would allow users to borrow DAI against stETH, similar to ETH 1.0.

We are very happy to have Vasily from Lido with us. He\u2019s going to walk us through the project, how it works. And then we\u2019re going to discuss in more detail the MIP 6 Collateral Application for stETH. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.

How do you solve that problem from your end?   8:35 \u2013 Juan Guill\u00e9n: I\u2019m curious about the validators part. Are you running the nodes yourself or is it someone else?

Does that pertain to Polkadot, Solana, et cetera?   26:11 \u2013 Frank Cruz: Let\u2019s say I mind 100 stETH, and then I take a loan note on AAVE. Market drops; eth gets cut in half. I get liquidated by AAVE. How does that affect my original eth in your protocol?   29:23 \u2013 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Let\u2019s say I put 10 ETH; you give me 10 stETH. Then my ETH goes to a validator. Let\u2019s say my ETH is on validator A and that validator does something wrong. Would my ETH get slashed? Because I\u2019m on validator A would I get slashed and someone that stacked on validator B would not? Or are we all part of a pool and everything is distributed accordingly?   31:10 \u2013 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Do you do KYC?

Did I catch that right?   42:17 \u2013 Tim Black: Are there other liquidity sources other than Curve?  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 46:25  Thank you very much, Vasily. It was great having you. Where can people find more about you and Lido Finance? (46:31) Next week we\u2019ll have the REINNO team. Natalia and her team are going to be joining us for RWA collateral onboarding.  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary.  ",
