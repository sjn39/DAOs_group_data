                    "content": "Reading through a few of these proposals, I\u2019ve seen some start to move toward self-delegation, which is causing some confusion we should address. I believe consensus is that self-delegation (when specifically included) is a valid ask, and yet some delegates are claiming that self-delegating is a blanket no and outright discouraging any self-delegation. This is a tough one because it\u2019s not like liquidity mining, for which we try to give rough value judgements because we\u2019d rather not rely on too much on it, it\u2019s: can protocols self-delegate or no. And I think we should be definitive about whether doing so is something allowed. If it is allowed, we can then discuss how much delegation is acceptable, how to manage held tokens for self-delegation, do these tokens need to also be earmarked for some other ask (and thus drawn down over time), etc. We started to do this in this thread but it doesn\u2019t seem as though we collectively got somewhere solid. In addition, right now the language in the template (shown below) is confusing:  The expectation is that token grants will not be self-delegated for use in governance. The primary purpose of these token grants is to incentivize sustainable usage and growth of the Optimism ecosystem. If you plan to increase your voting power by delegating a portion or all of your grant tokens to your own protocol, or a closely affiliated party, this should be made clear in your grant proposal along with your reasoning.  Some people might take that first sentence to mean that token grants shouldn\u2019t be self-delegated, rather than that the default is that they are not. If we think they\u2019re allowed, we should be more direct and even perhaps include a field in the template. Curious to hear people\u2019s thoughts - think this ought to be a settled matter soon before more protocols ask for this. ",

At first glance it seems to make more sense that the $Op tokens are received by the users and it is up to them to decide who to delegate to; but I think we should not limit ourselves to this, maybe we can see some interesting self-delegation proposal.

The primary purpose of these token grants is to incentivize sustainable usage and growth of the Optimism ecosystem.  The first line (italics my own) refers to the baseline expectation from OP Labs, this distributed funds incentivize usage and growth. Is it a prohibitive provision? No. It sets an expectation only.  If you plan to increase your voting power by delegating a portion or all of your grant tokens to your own protocol, or a closely affiliated party, this should be made clear in your grant proposal along with your reasoning.  The second portion of the statement is where I think OP Labs leaves the door open. Protocols CAN self delegate the granted OP but we as a community should be aware of that, be mindful of that and in the end, delegates can approve such distribution/usage or not. As always Optimism is breaking down barriers everywhere and experimenting continuously. So what are my own thoughts on this? Protocols CAN self delegate or delegate to others. Protocols NEED to include a explicit provision on their proposal that a portion of the ask will be used for delegation, to self or to others (the others need not be specified). Can this be gamed on some way? a thousand, but the most important step is we as a community will need to be vigilant ",

                    "content": "For my part, I\u2019ll just repurpose what I said in another thread: I think in many cases people need to be shown the value of governance power. There\u2019s a ton we\u2019re capable of accomplishing with enough participation and buyin from stakeholders, and we\u2019re all here because we know this. Not everyone knows this, and unless they do we\u2019re not going to have enough resources to follow through on our goals. There\u2019s an entire graveyard of projects and ecosystems that\u2019ll show you that grants and airdrops are in themselves not enough to sustain effort. Users, developers, and partners getting OP handouts can\u2019t be expected to immediately \u2018get it\u2019 just because they got some free money \u2013 they need to have some actual hands-on exposure to what we\u2019re doing. What i\u2019m saying is that sometimes you need to drag people to the party when you want them to show up. That\u2019s what facilitating self-delegation is to me. On concerns about collusion and centralization derived from this I think this fear is legitimate but entirely misplaced if you think self-delegation in broad daylight is a major vector here. The routes to collusion are many and don\u2019t require a lick of self-delegation. Self-interest is inherent to these structures and more insidious than ppl want to admit. You want to know how to avoid centralization and kneecap collusion? Get more stakeholders in the game. Right now the distribution of votes is more or less fixed since the airdrop, and the only distribution of OP is to protocols, which are doing nothing with them until doling out 60% of their granted tokens (realistically closer to 100% initially given the speed of liq mining relative to other uses) to the likes of stablecoin farmers to be dumped into LPs, again doing nothing. So there are likely few marginal delegators (the # of delegated tokens has consistently decreased, even as circulating supply has increased), and the same centralization concerns persist until the next marquee OP airdrop, which may or may not improve the distribution. @OPUser in the discord, probably responding to our discussions here, has floated the idea of making delegation a quest. This could be good for some delegation, but that power goes away when the vast majority of these players cash out their 5 OP earned. (This is up for debate, though \u2013 would love to see some early results from these quests.) But if we show projects, partners, builders what it means to get into governance and take part in assembling the collective, to tangle over heady ideas about coordination and incentivization, to cooperate and compete, and you start to see the decentralization we all want here. That\u2019s all to say that i think allowing some measure of self-delegation in fact hastens decentralization, and what\u2019s more, you get a bunch more voices in the forums. ",

                    "content": "My personal opinion here is that getting more protocols and builders invested and engaged in governance is unquestionably a good thing. If governance deems a protocol worthy of a grant, then I believe they should deem them worthy of some sort of formal voice in governance. This could actually be done very simply by saying that every protocol that receives a grant can use a flat amount (say 200,000 OP) to self-delegate as those tokens are waiting to be used for their intended purpose. This seems far better than having them just sit passively in wallets and would hopefully help protocols understand the value of acquiring OP tokens for this purpose. We have to remember that current token distribution was largely driven by the gifting of tokens via airdrop and the nature of delegation UI. It is right now fairly concentrated amongst a small group of people who have largely not had to go out and acquire it themselves. Now is the time to grow the governance pie and further decentralize, not create barriers to participation. But if my opinion is in the minority, I agree that we should make it clear to protocols that proposals for self-delegation only increases the likelihood they\u2019ll be rejected by the committees. If they want a voice in governance they\u2019ll either need to purchase it or spend time campaigning for it. I think this is sub-optimal, but lack of clarity or consistency here would be much worse.

                    "content": "For completion I will include a post from @Defi_LATAM_axlvaz:    [REVIEW] [GF: PHASE 1 PROPOSAL] Alchemix   I think self-delegation can also bring parasitic protocols into the network as well as users farming the token in their protocols. I also believe that if Alchemix had any interest in this governance it would have appointed at least one delegate, why didn\u2019t it do so if it sought to have a say in this governance? Asking for support in your community is a good start and has a cost of $0 as well as appointing a delegate to represent Alchemix\u2019s interests. In the event that the proposal is not voted YES, will Alchemix still be interested in governance as one of the protocols they seek to develop in the network? Self-delegation with token grants is the same thing @jackanorak complains about from users. What I don\u2019t see in the protocols being pushed by @jackanorak for self-delegation is at least minimal participation beyond his own proposals.   ",
