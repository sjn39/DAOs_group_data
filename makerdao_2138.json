Paragraph Summary If approved, DECOs budget(MIP40c3-SP35 and MIP40c3-SP36) will end on May 31st. This will end streaming of new funds and vesting of MKR to DECO CU members.  Specification  Stop streaming of Dai to DECO on May 31st. End vesting of MKR to DECO CU members on May 31st. Remaining funds in DECO controlled wallets will be returned to MakerDAO on May 31st.   Motivation In 2021, DECO was given a 3 year budget. There have been considerable shifts in the needs and resources of the DAO since it was approved, along with DECO\u2019s changing role in the context of the endgame. The CU\u2019s budget and goals should be reevaluated, so I propose ending their current budget in May. This will give DECO time to propose a new budget and new goals that best uses MakerDAO\u2019s scarce resources and technical talent.  Core Unit ID DECO-001 ",

                    "content": "Thanks for expressing your concerns, Codeknight. The Deco Core Unit did in fact have a pleasant discussion with one of the Wallfacer Labs principals. The core unit felt it important to keep Wallfacer apprised regarding the proposal, as drafted. The Wallfacer principals were unable to attend our recent office hours presentation and hence, were not aware of our concerns. We would have preferred to reach out to the delegation sooner, but we only learned of their participation in MakerDAO governance when the delegation platform was updated a few days ago.  The MIP as Proposed Produces No Winners Our  intention was to simply inform them regarding our concerns with the proposal. These were the same concerns we raised in the recent delegate office hours. As composed, \u201cnobody wins\u201d in this proposal. We are unclear as to what this proposal hopes to achieve; it does not seem to offer a clear signal as to what next steps are. If the intention is to unwind the core unit, we would suggest proposing an MIP consistent with the agreed upon unwind terms, which are simply 3 months of runway from notice by MakerDAO vote ( the termination of the stream). The three-month Dai runway funds are held for the benefit of the Deco CU by SES as the fiduciary on-chain (@juan). This is different from normal core units, who have 3 months of runway in their operational wallet and two months in their auditor wallet, leaving 5 months of total runway. As composed, this MIP removes an entire quarter of MKR vest for all contributors on May 31, one day before they are to receive it, June 1. While we do not think this was the intent of CodeKnight or Wallfacer, the MIP as composed rugs the CU of its quarterly MKR vest, only after it has already completed work for the entire term. This is of course at odds with every other core unit, which has dss-vest streams and receive either pro-rata, or in most cases, accelerated MKR vests.  We would be happy to hold another presentation for those who were unable to attend the previous call, if a group of delegates desire. ",

Since the proposal would need to modified regardless, we imagine maybe it doesn\u2019t make the most sense to vote on it now, especially amidst the other more pressing endgame proposals. If your delegation desires to understand how the acute work of Deco aligns with Maker\u2019s imminent and long term goals, we would be happy to host another presentation at office hours. Endgame Roadmap and Office Hours As far as I can tell, the objective of this proposal is to ensure Maker is appropriately utilizing its current technical resources to advance the endgame. We believe the current timeline and milestones for deliverables of Deco do just this. On April 15, Deco will be posting its Q1 update, alongside a design overview for the FRM and the contemplated work timeline. This timeline is the same one suggested in our most recent office hours. This timeline projects a complete V1 product package slated for delivery by end of Q2. After these posts, we will host another office hours call to discuss the design, roadmap, product, etc. Perhaps it makes the most sense to table this proposal until we can all meet then? The Deco CU will bring an agenda with a clear goal as well as all the necessary information to have an informed discussion. At this meeting, we can then collaboratively discuss if the design and roadmap make sense for Maker. If after that call you decide a defunding proposal is still required, we would be happy to work with you to draft the appropriate language for MKR holders to vote on. Is this a reasonable path forward? ",
