A wee spike on Curve1530\u00d7349 32.4 KB   We\u2019ve written about Curve as a settlement layer before, but how about 2 billion in trading to make the point.

DAI Supply1362\u00d7745 81.1 KB   DAI is supply-managed well but is still on the decline following the broader market. TVL is still in double digits at 10.6 billion. Overall collateralization is trending safer at 166%.    2.8 billion in the PSM, large outflows are not a surprise to anyone \u2013 we hope. If you went on vacation, maybe don\u2019t check your phone?   Vault changes1093\u00d7860 137 KB   On a weekly granular level, unwinding is led by premier assets like ETH-A, ETH-C, and WBTC-A. There are still almost 2000 ETH-A vaults, so these are healthy users taking care and protecting against liquidations.    While 200 billion in overall crypto wealth evaporated,  liquidations were orderly and efficient. There were three million in fees, 30 million in debt auctioned, and 15 unique keepers/takers.

Weekly vault changes2010\u00d71582 354 KB   This week, a continuing pattern of a flight to safety, as macro shakedowns continue to exert pressure on markets. A slight rally though through the weekend. ETH-A is leading vault reductions with 60 fewer vaults and 92 million less debt. Without any price cratering, it looks to be that vault owners are paying down debts. ETH-C picked up a healthy gain of 2.76 million despite fewer vaults over the week.   ETH-A risk portfolio978\u00d71034 63.8 KB   Looking into ETH-A more, the dominating risk category is medium primarily because the largest vault sits at 230% collateralized.

Now separate from the Weekly Relay with the objective to scale and improve all the information you need for your Dai escapades!  The public PDF version is available here.    Peg884\u00d7626 102 KB   It\u2019s been a dog of a market this last week. Peg mostly trades at a premium through curve rebalancings, broader stablecoin capitulation, and max pain red candles. It feels like 2018 again.   24 hour versus 7 day764\u00d7362 52.7 KB   Over the past week or even in the past 24 hours, the DAI peg is still snapping back to par quickly and staying mostly above 1.   DEX&#39;s lead the way curve as the ultimate settlement1551\u00d7474 79.9 KB   DEX\u2019s lead the way, with most DAI trades settling back to Curve. Ninety-eight million in the past 24 hours.   DAI Supply1359\u00d7739 80.5 KB   DAI supply continues to reduce in the face of a market downturn and a decent chunk of USDC PSM burns.    Visualizing the PSM outflow helps to see the drop over time. Balance is now at 3.2 billion in USDC.   Vault changes1564\u00d7855 152 KB   Double-digit percentage changes over the week. With ETH-A leading vault reductions, 270 million less supply from 41 fewer vaults.   ETH OI1522\u00d7745 66.6 KB   Over the last week, ETH perps and futures evaporated a billion dollars in open interest: 7.4 to 6.5 billion.   Net burn926\u00d7610 44.6 KB   A net burn this week, 876 million DAI burned, and most of it over the weekend.  Visit Makerburn for an up-to-the-minute breakdown of system changes.   Not all is lost for users, though; only 17 auctions settled on 1.5 million in debt.   Defi unique borrowers also sad925\u00d7395 20 KB   Don\u2019t fret, though; we\u2019re all in this sinking boat together, DeFi unique borrowers peaked a few days ago. Reset back to single digits in the past day. It will rise again; the market is brutal but nothing like a shared struggle to incentivize collective action.   Vaults at risk751\u00d7867 106 KB   77 high-risk Vaults through more price drops. At the time of writing on the cusp of two WBTC vaults hitting auction.   Risky debt at 1.731483\u00d7445 87.8 KB   9% drop starts to creep into low-risk vaults.   Majority risk buckets still low risk751\u00d7487 36.7 KB   Low risk is the majority of the appetite. However, there is more debt in the medium and high-risk categories.   ETH-C Organic demand730\u00d7543 39.3 KB   For large vaults and organic demand, ETH-C is leading, with most of its vaults sitting at just over 200% collateralized.  daistats.com | makerburn.com | maker.blockanalitica.com  We Are aing for Your Feedback We value your input!
