                    "content": "I got asked recently about how to run / prepare people to have a good EthMagicians-style session or ring gathering. So here are some quick thoughts. Identify the facilitators This can usually be done ahead of time, but at other times the original person who suggested the topic might not be attending. Or the topic suggestor isn\u2019t comfortable with guiding a session. The facilitator mainly should keep the flow of discussion going. They might help open or close the session. They should definitely make space for different voices, and ask others to make space if they have been carrying the conversation a lot. Reinforce action items so the scribe can capture them. Suggest moving on and/or doing a follow up. Inspire people to contribute, that they are being heard, and to keep doing work on the topic at hand. Ask for one or more scribes We tend to use HackMD https://HackMD.io a lot. Multiple people can view and edit simultaneously, and the Markdown formatting is portable to the forums here, to GitHub, and most places that Markdown is supported. Creating a HackMD file ahead of a session is excellent, but the web addresses are a bit funky. Note it down, or even start an EthMagicians topic here with the link \u2014 which you can come back to and fill out with final notes. At least one scribe should take notes. Action items or unanswered questions are more important than a transcript of who said what. Scribes often don\u2019t get a chance to participate as much \u2014 if they do, make sure someone else takes on scribing what they have to add. We haven\u2019t done a lot of this, but ad hoc audio or video capture with a smartphone could be helpful. Determine next steps & follow up A simple example is \u201cplease give your email to the scribe and we will send out notes\u201d. For the sake of EthMagicians, often this can be \u201clook for the notes post on the forum, and Bob will plan a video call in 3 weeks\u201d. Try and assign actual individuals to take on specific follow up actions. And don\u2019t have just one person unless the tasks are very small. Posting notes to the forum and using it to follow up should be considered the default next step for a session. Even if the notes were scribed in HackMD, cut and pasting the Markdown text into the forum here is preferred so we know we have a copy of the content. Or, \u201cAlice is filing a GitHub issue in the Florp repo\u201d Get & give feedback Can you get feedback as a facilitator or participant on how the session went? Can the participants give feedback? As part of the notes from the scribe being shared, encourage this feedback. \u201cNext time we should do more of this and less of that\u201d - \u201cI really enjoyed how we did X\u201d Further Reading and Resources This should probably be a Scrolls wiki or HackMD document, which we can perhaps copy and paste this into later and evolve over time. The Open Space User\u2019s Guide is good reading for not only a single session but a whole event: https://openspaceworld.com/users_guide.htm There are various things to call out, like \u201cthe law of two feet\u201d. If the session you are in is not enjoyable or isn\u2019t want you want \u2014 use your two feet and leave.
