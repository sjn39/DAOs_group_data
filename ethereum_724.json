The current first auction fee market works but is extremely inefficient and a large UX barrier for adoption. This proposal introduces a fixed fee concept through the use of a MINFEE. Users can pay a premium over this if they want but in general it greatly simplifies the UX. One great benefit of this EIP is because the MINFEE is burned and must be paid in Eth, we are making sure economic abstraction does not occur on the protocol level which is extremely important for long term Eth value. One note I\u2019ll make is while the current EIP mentions Eth 1.0, we should also consider it in the Eth 2.0 implementations. I\u2019d like for this to be considered for the Istanbul fork. What are general thoughts and concerns around this? Links EIP-1559 Ethresear.ch Post w/ Vitalik\u2019s Paper ",

If we reduce the issuance reward portion of what miner/validators earn (as is planned for future block reward reductions in PoW and the rewards system in PoS), this reduces the incentive for the miner/validators to actually include transactions in a block (since they are getting paid regardless via inflation), meaning the total congestion goes down until txns with \u201ctips\u201d are included. This may basically revert to the current auction-based fee model over time. ",

There are tons of very interesting things that can be done, very simply and very effectively (especially since we have a TON of data to analyze about the current system), but applying controls theory works best when you go through the exercise of defining the system in the framework.

In particular, any idea that involved the burning of fees would make EIP 960 impossible under any inflationary system like Eth 2.0 As an alternative proposal, how about leveraging miners own self-interests against eachother.  Ideally this approach becomes a drop in replacement when miners -> stakers. To accomplish this, compare the minfee used/charged by a given block versus the <X=24> hour rolling average of minfees from blocks.  If the minfee of the block in question is lower than the X hour rolling average, apply a bonus of 0-5% to the miner\u2019s reward depending on the size of the decrease.  If the minfee of the block in question is higher than the 24-hour rolling average (AKA, either demand is spiking or a miner is attempting to increase their own minfee ala the graph in Vitalik\u2019s paper), apply a penalty of 0-5% to the miner\u2019s reward depending on the size of the decrease. In this way, miners are incentivized to take action that benefits the long-term ecosystem (Lower fees, more adoption, but not unconstrained spam) without changing the way gaslimits can be adjusted in response to raw increased adoption & demand.  Miners who proactively reduce fees gain small benefit; Miners who attempt to push the minimum fee up to earn more profit pay a penalty, and should only do so when the demand is truly sufficient to justify the penalty.  Miners maintaining the status quo see no change. To prevent abuse / exploitation, these steps and penalties/rewards can be capped, i.e., preventing miners from doing 4 bonus \u201cdown\u201d fee steps for a 5% bonus each time followed by a very large 20% \u201cup\u201d step to counterbalance for a single 5% penalty.

I think this statement mis-frames the inclusion criteria. Here\u2019s a mirror image:     veox:  It is extremely unlikely that a transaction will be included until basefee falls so low that the tip is significant.   I still fail to see how \"just basefee plus some small tip\" would translate to lower net-wide fee variance (when comparing periods of low/high demand for gas). And, more importantly, that average basefee+tip would ever be lower than the current average fee. As @fubuloubu wrote:     fubuloubu:  If the transactions included end up optimizing for the \u201ctip\u201d added to a transaction, then how have we not re-created the existing fee market, but worse because of this burning requirement?   (I\u2019ve heard this being mentioned at the rumour mill, that \u201cEIP-1559 issue 1559 === cheaper transactions\u201d; not in this thread yet.)  The trade-off for the miner is currently between block_reward+fees and ommer_block_reward. In the proposed scheme, it would be between block_reward+tips and ommer_block_reward. Miners include transactions in blocks based on the marginal profit increase they would get, offset by the chance that the block would become an ommer. Currently, fees rarely make 5% of base block reward. (This was <3% before the most recent issuance reduction; sorry I can\u2019t link a chart: the numbers are from anecdotal personal observation.) Let\u2019s generously assume that the average fees per block are, in fact, 5% of the base block reward (that is, they are 0.1 ETH and 2.0 ETH, respectively). So, miners have to weigh this 5% extra gain at probability P against a 12.5% loss (at best! 25% for 2-block-old ommer) at probability 1-P. The profitability condition is: 0.05 * P >  0.125 * (1 - P)        P >~ 0.714 0.05 * P >  0.25 * (1 - P)        P >~ 0.833 ...    F * P > U * (1 - P)  # F: extra profit percentage when getting Fees        P > U / (F + U)  # U: loss percentage due to becoming Uncle  Back to what I started with: I fail to see how lowering user-born fees (and by necessity lowering F, since F is the tips part in basefees+tips, and ostensibly basefees+tips < fees\u2026) will result in anything but the miners becoming reluctant to include transactions. It\u2019s reasonable to expect the opposite: average basefees+tips under this proposal will be higher than average current fees. (There! It\u2019s out of the way now.)  The scheme further breaks down in times of \u201ccongestion\u201d; that being a descriptor for increased average uncle rate: an ever-larger proportion of hashing power contributing to \u201csecurity of the chain\u201d, but not (i.e.: at the expense of) transaction throughput. During congestion, when relatively many ommer solutions are available, miners:  routinely have the option to include ommer references in their blocks - because, hey, they keep popping up!; and are increasingly pressed to drop transactions altogether - because \u201cno compute\u201d is much faster to process than the \u201cmuch compute\u201d blocks from the competition (ones that would do well to get out of the way and become ommers\u2026).  Transactions are now in competition with uncles; in particular, the highly-priced transactions (that tend to catch the eye and prompt \u201ccongestion!.. congestion!..\u201d). If they can\u2019t \u201coutbid\u201d the inclusion of an uncle (adjusted for the risk of the block itself becoming an ommer!), then it is not rational for miners to include transactions instead of ommers. This is not specific to the proposed scheme, but is also the state of affairs currently (and manifested mildly in late 2017 and early 2018, I believe). As noted in the github issue 1559 summary:  If a transaction sender highly values urgency during conditions of congestion, they are free to instead set a much higher premium and effectively bid in the traditional first-price-auction style.  In other words, during congestion, the proposed scheme devolves (at best!) to the current auction mechanism. All good here, except the \u201cat best\u201d part: see previous section.  Somewhat OT: I am against lowering user-born transaction fees wholesale, until a \u201cstate fees\u201d portion is introduced to them. Any scheme that claims to lower user-born fees needs to consider that state expansion gets this much faster when user-born fees are that much lower. The cost is now born by someone else than the users, but they are not gone. That said, I do appreciate burning a portion of ether, as a means to balance (counter-act) newly-minted ether.  Finally: having both a gasprice_tip (per-gas-unit, in shannons) and cap (per-whole-tx, in ether), where   gasprice_tip * gas_limit <= cap;  basefee <= gasprice_tip * gas_limit;  basefee <= cap.  \u2026 will be a nightmare for UX; and will most likely devolve into basefee <= cap as far as wallet interfaces are concerned, with gasprice_tip abstracted away as a percentage of cap\u2026 ",

Currently, a miner has two reasons NOT to include a transaction:  Opportunity cost (ie. other transactions) Increased uncle rate risk  (2) is predictable, (1) is unpredictable. This proposal brings (1) out of the equation, so we should expect miners to be satisfied by a constant level of tip even as basefee fluctuates.  will result in anything but the miners becoming reluctant to include transactions.  We can actually calculate the size of this the marginal uncle rate risk (ie. increase in change your block becomes an uncle from including an additional 1 million gas in a block). The thing we would do before is run a linear regression of gas usage vs uncle rate data here to see what the marginal risk of being uncled is if you add more than 1 million gas. Unfortunately, this is temporarily complicated because we recently upgraded network block propagation, and there\u2019s still relatively little data post-change. So what we can do is use the formula U = (k1 + k2 * G) / T where U is uncle rate, T is block time and G is gas usage of a block (see Decker and Wattenhofer 2013 for some of the arguments that lead to this). We have a natural experiment in Constantinople bringing T down, so we can use block, uncle and gas usage before and after the fork. Before we had 220 uncles and 4200 blocks per day, so U_pre = 0.0523, after we have 500 uncles and 6400 blocks per day, so U_post = 0.078. Block time = 86400 / blocks per day, so we get T_pre = 20.57 and T_post = 13.5. G_pre = 7.5m, G_post = 6.2m (see here). So we get: 0.078 = (k1 + k2 * 6.2m) / 13.5 0.0523 = (k1 + k2 * 7.5m) / 20.57  Solving the linear system gives: k1 = 0.944 k2 = 0.0175 * 10**-6  To get an incremental uncle rate per million gas, you would need to divide k2 by the block time (13.5) so you get 0.0013 per million gas. Another way to see how k2 is tiny is that a 2/3x reduction in block time leads to a 3/2x increase in uncle rate, showing that \u201cbase\u201d (ie. not usage-dependent) uncle rate by itself explains almost all of the uncle rate. If you enter x=AVG_BLOCK_UTIL and y=UNCLE_RATE in etherchain\u2019s correlation utility  and set the date to Jan 16 (first Constantinople attempt, which is what forced everyone to update), you can see the line doesn\u2019t slope up quickly at all. Note that as an absolute upper limit, marginal uncle rate risk is 0.01 per million gas, because that\u2019s what it would be if all of the current uncle rate were explainable by the k2 * G term. So we have two estimates for marginal uncle rate risk: 0.0013 per million (aggressive) and 0.01 per million (maximally conservative). We can compute the expected loss to a miner of including a transaction via U' * (R_B - R_U) (marginal uncle rate risk * block reward minus uncle reward). The average uncle reward is ~1.67 (note that this means that most uncles are getting the full 7/8 reward; a year ago this was not true, which is part of why a year ago many miners were not including blocks). So R_B = 2, R_U = 1.67 and U' = 0.0013 per million gas, so expected loss per million gas is 0.000433 ETH (or 0.433 gwei per gas). Under conservative estimates this goes up to 3.33 gwei per gas. TLDR: the disincentive that miners have against including txs is currently already quite low, somewhere between 0.4 and 3.3 gwei, which is only a small portion of transaction fees seen today. ",

Etherchain\u2019s correlations page provides the latter. This works with the assumption that blocks become uncles not because of the particular transaction inclusion strategy used to construct them, but because of other factors, which can be summed up as \u201crandom luck\u201d (the worst there is ). It\u2019s probably hard to prove one way or another with real historic ommers (which are not guaranteed to be available), so IMO this is an OK assumption to roll with (until proven otherwise, e.g. by intentionally seeking out missing ommers over devp2p ASAP, and comparing them to the nephews as classes).      vbuterin:  the disincentive that miners have against including txs is currently already quite low, somewhere between 0.4 and 3.3 gwei, which is only a small portion of transaction fees seen today.   That is 0.4 to 3.3 gwei per gas, and it is not insignificant. (In fact, this is the gas price range I most often use\u2026) Gitcoin\u2019s gas history breakdown shows \u201cgas price needed to confirm within 3 hours\u201d to fall most of the time within that range, and \u201cgas price need to confirm within 1 minute\u201d skipping off of the 3.5 mark (or so). Even using Etherscan\u2019s average gas price chart (which shows y-day\u2019s as 13.5 shannon), the difference is only around one order of magnitude. This, I feel, is not a good chart/metric to use; what is needed here is a breakdown by gas price ranges over time; something like Johoe\u2019s Bitcoin Mempool charts, but for Ethereum main-line blocks. Then we could see how much of the gas used falls into the 0.4-3.3 gas price range (or, more prudently, recalculate this gas price range for each time period in question), where miners are taking an ever-more-guaranteed risk, \u201cout of the kindness of their heart\u201d.

But what you need to keep in mind is that, in an economic sense, the BASEFEE and the TIP are NOT additive. To see why, imagine that following two facts are true:  The fee level at which there is 8 million gas of demand per block is, in some particular span of time, 5 gwei Miners value the cost of including 1 gas worth of transactions at 1 gwei  Clearly, no miner will accept a transaction with a tip of less than 1 gwei, and let\u2019s say there\u2019s a bit of monopoly power added on top so miners on average only accept transactions with tips of 1.5 gwei. Suppose the BASEFEE starts off at 1 gwei. Users would have to pay only 2.5 gwei total, so demand is higher than 8 million; hence, blocks are more than 50% full, and the BASEFEE rises. Eventually, when the BASEFEE reaches 3.5 gwei (NOT 5 gwei!), users have to pay 5 gwei total, and at that point demand is equal to 8 million, so the BASEFEE reaches an equilibrium. The one special case is the case where the equilibrium fee is less than the tip that miners demand. In this case, the BASEFEE would fall to zero and blocks would just be less than 50% full until demand rises again.

I am a non-developer who has performed several thousand transactions in the last few months, and paid gas prices ranging from 1 to 40 Gwei via metamask.     The current system actually works fairly well for me, since I have become an expert in picking the correct gas price, but I would like to not spend so much time gaming the gas prices. Rather than adjusting the MINFEE by 1/8 in each block, is there a reason we can\u2019t adjust it once a day to remove fluctuation even more?  I would like to see a target of 50 Billion gas per day rather than 8 million per block, and triple the max size of each block to 24 million gas (uncles allowing).    That way if a big ICO or surge of spam hits, we could see 100 Billion in gas for 24 hours, and then MINFEE increases once every 6200 blocks (like Bitcoin-style difficulty adjustments) until the daily gas usage falls below the target\u2026at which point it slowly starts coming back down.   This would have the nice effect of doubling current transaction capacity during busy periods while keeping the state size growth where it is now. If anyone has a super urgent transaction, they could pay 2x MINFEE to (nearly) guarantee it in the next block.  Metamask could then simplify the choice of fee to Normal and Fast (2x). ",

                    "content": "Replied on the Zcash thread, copying my replies here: I think I see the flaw in your attack strategy. Your attack basically says that the attacker (with 10% of all transactions) concentrates their transactions in every tenth block, so nine blocks out of ten, the attacker\u2019s share is empty and the block size is 90% of the target, and the tenth time the attacker sends all their transactions so the block size is 190% of the target. This means that gas usage adjusts down by 1.25% nine blocks out of ten and adjusts up 11.25% the tenth time, but because of (x-a)*(x+a) < x**2 inequalities, this leads to a slight decrease on average (0.9875 ** 9 * 1.1125 ~= 0.9934 per 10-block period). Applying this 100 times, we get the observed 50% decrease. So it is true that it\u2019s possible to send the same transaction volume with slightly different consequences to demand, but this ignores the fact that demand adjusts with fees, and once the fee drops a few percent others will come in and the equilibrium re-established. All that this means is that in equilibrium average usage will be about 0.5% higher than the target; not a big deal. That said, if we want to eliminate this issue entirely, we can do that by replacing minfee *= (1 + excess * adjSpeed) with minfee *= e ** (excess * adjSpeed). Doing exponentiation in consensus is hard, but if we apply a quadratic Taylor approximation e ** x = 1 + x + x**2 / 2, so we do minfee *= (1 + excess * adjSpeed + (excess * adjSpeed) ** 2 / 2) , then the discrepancy drops from 1 - 0.9934 to 1 - 0.99978. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth the extra complexity, I think either way works fine.  Users are paying for the burden which the previous users put on the network rather than their own  This is intentional for incentive compatibility. It\u2019s a common technique in game theory for the price that a user pays to be explicitly only based on other users\u2019 activity, so that incentive-compatibility for the user can be proven trivially as a simple matter of \u201cif the price is favorable the user gets it, otherwise the user does not\u201d. Otherwise, a user\u2019s \u201creal price\u201d is higher than the \u201cset price\u201d because a user has to take into account the fact that their own transaction pushes up the real price for themselves.

Yes, I agree with your observation. However, I think this can actually be a good point and should be exploited because it incentivizes a user to avoid executing a lot of transactions in a single block. This is similar to the problem of liquifying a large volume of some asset in game theory, in which whenever you sell some amount the price goes down, and as a result, you are incentivized to sell little by little. I think the same mechanism design helps to avoid network congestion. To be more specific, I have already mentioned the paper \u201cOptimal Execution of Portfolio Transactions\u201d in which the authors prove that if we have a very similar additive update formula, the optimal strategy is to execute transactions over a long period of time. Maybe we can use the same formula in here.  That said, if we want to eliminate this issue entirely, we can do that by replacing minfee *= (1 + excess * adjSpeed) with minfee *= e ** (excess * adjSpeed).  If I rewrite your formula as log(minfee) += excess * adjSpeed your alternative suggestion is just to have the same additive update rule and then exponentiate it to get minfee. As I said in the previous comment the additive framework is well-known in economics but why the exponential? In other words, suppose that minfee += excess * adjSpeed, and then we charge everyone a fee of f(minfee). f could be the identity function, an affine mapping, or any other positive increasing function including the exponential function, but I am not sure why exponential seems like a canonical choice to you?  This is intentional for incentive compatibility. It\u2019s a common technique in game theory for the price that a user pays to be explicitly only based on other users\u2019 activity, so that incentive-compatibility for the user can be proven trivially as a simple matter of \u201cif the price is favorable the user gets it, otherwise the user does not\u201d.  Even in the new settings corrected by the exponential or additive formula, I still believe that users should also be charged for their own transactions as well as the aggregated previous usage. Today, I was reading about the gas token and any such smart contract exploiting storage refund in Ethereum can be used for hoarding which is immediately profitable if the gas price you pay is independent of the gas cost of your smart contract.

This seems like a natural property to have, especially since it means that the fee can adjust to unexpectedly huge spikes in logarithmic time rather than linear time. If we don\u2019t care about this, then a linearly adjusted min fee (eg. max 0.25 gwei adjustment per block) could work too.  Vitalik suggested introducing a minimum in the MIN_FEE formula, like 1000 wei. It worked, until the around the block 4.13m, after which the MIN_FEE started to run away into infinity, and by the block 4.7m the numbers were 1 console page long   So this is why you can\u2019t test the min fee formula without actually using it on a blockchain. The feedback mechanism critically depends on the fact that if the fee shoots up demand decreases.  However, I think this can actually be a good point and should be exploited because it incentivizes a user to avoid executing a lot of transactions in a single block.  If the total volume in one block ends up exceeding the gas limit, then it already becomes more expensive for you, because you have to outbid other people\u2019s fee premiums. If it does not, then as I mentioned in my presentation, there\u2019s basically negligible social harm from having one block with 12 million gas followed by a block with 4 million gas compared to two blocks with 8 million gas, so what\u2019s the problem?

They can fill them up, and once the price is zero, it always remains zero. I think that there should be no incentive for miners to roll back into the auction-based system. My proposal is a sliding median price auction for the premiums to avoid overpayments instead of the first price auction. You can read more details in here.     AlexeyAkhunov:  The first thing I noticed is that formula for MIN_FEE gets stuck at 0 if it ever gets there. Any suggestions?   Continuing my previous discussion about the choice of the update function f, the additive formula does not have this problem as the price can always recover from zero. ",

Another open question for me:  Is the computation cost of verifying there is a miner-tip for a transaction enough to justify a miner even considering adding it?  My thinking so far is that it isn\u2019t enough for one person to tip \u201cenough\u201d, but there have to be enough people tipping enough for the likelihood of any one transaction to have enough value for a miner to consider including any transactions.  From a miner\u2019s point of view, what is the Expected Value (in the sense of probability theory) of adding one transaction to my block? From a users view, what is the minimum I can pay to get my transaction included?  My worry is that usually the \u201cPay as little as I can get away with\u201d, or \u201cPay a little bit more than the person that pays least.\u201d tends the system to zero. The game theory of unlimited vacation days in corporations is a good example of this. Perhaps system norms can fight this, or even displaying average gas-tip per block in the UX so users are encouraged to keep what is working working and can tip extra if they are impatient. This is probably something that will be seen as it runs on the network and the network can adapt to it through off chain coordination. Or, perhaps the cost of inclusion of a transaction is so low it won\u2019t even be a problem. Overall, I really like this idea of separating the auctions of gas-limit (network throughput) and block inclusion. ",

The first point I don\u2019t think will be much of a problem. The base_fee will be very predictable and if it works out as intended the miner_tip that miners will accept will also be stable. Or, at least the minimum tip they would consider. The second point is something that we will see as it gets deployed. It is definetly possible that miners could reject transactions based on the tip being too low. It may also be that they get together as a group and \u201cdemand higher wages\u201d. This would be a tough sale as rogue miners could swoop in to get increase profits, so there is likely an equilibrium there. Hard to tell where it will be until we get there. It is also depends on how coordinated the miners can be. And, by miners I really mean mining pools. ",

Let the MAX gas float up to 4x the target of 8 million for the entire day.   If we use 175 Billion gas instead of the daily 50 Billion target, AND that raises the 30-day moving average above 50 Billion, then the BASEFEE inches up to 12 Gwei tomorrow, and 20% more the day after that, etc\u2026until the average gas usage returns to target.  Sure, the state size can grow at 4x for very a few days, but it really doesn\u2019t matter as long as the gas slowly reprices to limit state growth to something sustainable. Tips would only really be needed (1) to incentivize miners to take the transaction and (2) if the network is under a severe load (whether the surge due to an ICO or Cryptokitties or DOS), in which case it can revert to more of a competitive auction.    But set the default tip at 25% of BASEFEE.   Everyone knows the gas price, and that it might go up (or down) 20% tomorrow.   If a client pays yesterday\u2019s basefee by accident (e.g. they submit the tx a few seconds before the BASEFEE changes, then their 25% tip will be reduced to 5% and probably still be accepted by a miner. Clients can still opt to pay double the BASEFEE (or more) as a tip for high priority transactions during congestion. I fail to see why the gas price needs to change so rapidly as every few blocks.  It makes for a frustrating user experience.  We have the luxury of a low uncle rate now, so there is no barrier to allowing high capacity days to occur. ",

The block gas limit currently acts as a protective measure for short term attacks (mispriced opcodes taking too much CPU resources, ala Shanghai), and long term attacks (state bloat). The proposed EIP insta-bumps the gas limit to 24M, which would lead to block times of 200-1000ms (just pulled some random numbers from a Geth full node). By removing miners\u2019 capabilities to influence the block gas limit, we also remove the possibility to adjust in case of a future DoS attack. Is this good? Bad? Would be nice to discuss. Wrt long term state bloat, the bumped gas limit will also permit a 3x rate of growth compared to current limits. The EIP assumes that people won\u2019t be willing to pay for that, but until now we\u2019ve seen that Ethereum blocks are always full.  I guess the design is that eventually the basefee grows so large that \u201cnobody\u201d will want to play, so it will fall back down. I can imagine this working out, but would be interested in some discussion around it. One interesting phenomenon that I see is that users would sign a transaction that actually permits an interval for the fees, but you\u2019ve no idea how much that will end up being. This will make sweeping an account impossible. Good? Bad? Dunno, just stating the facts. A complication might arise around transaction propagation. Currently transactions have a total order, so full nodes can pick the best N transactions to keep and discard anything afterwards as SPAM). The base fee model could make things messy here, because the total order can change across blocks. We need to ensure that it\u2019s not possible to create transaction propagation scenarios where data rotates in the network indefinitely. ",

The problem remains the same: There is limited gas avaible and people will compete with their respective tip that is equivalent to the current fee. Furthermore (because the BASEFEE is equivalent to taxation) there will be lower welfare. A BASEFEE is also highly unfair since rich and poor individual pay the same fee. Imagine a scenario where there is a period of high network usage and therefore a high BASEFEE and tip. People with high willigness to pay will get their transactions included( probably rich people). Now imagine a period of low network usage where there would be low tips and  a person with low willigness to pay could get his transcation included.

To be honest I didn\u2019t read through the whole thread here so I hope it wasn\u2019t answered before. What is the incentive of miners to increase the BASEFEE? As the proposal states:  A valid BASEFEE is one such that abs(BASEFEE - PARENT_BASEFEE) <= max(1, PARENT_BASEFEE // BASEFEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR)  So as I understand that the miners can decide what the next BASEFEE will be. Reducing the BASEFEE would result in more people sending transactions leading to bigger blocks (up to SLACK_COEFFICIENT * TARGET_GASUSED) and potentially more tips => more profit for miners. What incentives do they have to increase the BASEFEE? When I first read the proposal I thought there is a deterministic consensus rule which determines the next BASEFEE based on the gas used in the previous block (or maybe better in the previous N blocks?) and the miner has to follow this rule (basically what is now described as \u201cdefault strategy\u201d but is not enforced in the current proposal). Why not use such an approach? ",

All changes included are additive. Here are a few main points. Fork 1:  Add new transaction type Both run in parallel A transition function that overtime reduces gas available on the the old type and increases gas available for the 1559 transaction type  Fork 2:  Clean up Unlock any remaining of the total 16 million gas for the new type.  Incentives to adopt the 1559 transaction type We already have a \u201cstick\u201d in the form of reducing the gas available to the original transaction type. To introduce a \u201ccarrot\u201d to encourage adoption by users and wallets we suggest that any gas cost reductions, or gas price updates only be available for the new 1559 transaction type. The implementation study includes how this is possible from a code perspective, and this approach simplifies a lot of the game theory around the transition to the new type. Starkware recently championed an EIP for reducing gas costs for Istanbul. I have worked closely with them, and there is plenty of room for additional decreases in gas cost in subsequent forks for incentives. Also, any gas updates to individual op_codes are available to us as well. Looking forward to your comments, questions, and feedback.

For the existing proof-of-work system it may actually make more sense, instead of just burning everything collected in BASEFEE, to put some or all of it in a fee pool to be distributed equally among the miners of the following x blocks. That way you preserve the current incentive structure for miners as a collective where they want total fees collected to be high, and you should be able to also keep the current system where miner voting controls the network\u2019s capacity. If you burn all the base fees, the next step seems to be to say, \u201cOK, we can\u2019t trust miners to control this so we need to replace the miner voting mechanism\u201d, and you end up potentially shaving a lot of yaks unrelated to the original fee market improvements.

I guess this isn\u2019t attracting a lot of attention right now because fees are pretty low compared to the block reward (something like 3% on average) so any contribution they\u2019re making is fairly insignificant and hardly worth wasting pixels over. However, already there are some times when fees become significant - the recent case was when ETH crashed and there was a spike in defi activity. It strikes me that times like this are currently the security worst-case for Ethereum: Security spend is abruptly dropping (because ETH crashed) but at the same time the value transacted on-chain is very high. High value transacted on-chain makes attacks - whether rolling back the chain to change transaction order or censoring transactions - more profitable, so we need more security spend to disincentivize them. If there was nothing of value being transacted then there would be nothing to gain by messing with the transaction history, but if there\u2019s a lot of value being transacted then there\u2019s a lot of money to be made. If this is right then fees paid to miners act as a kind of automatic stabilizer where the security requirement is (at least somewhat) correlated with value transacted, and value transacted is (at least somewhat) correlated with fees paid. You can then look at this from either end: Either we hold our desired level of security constant and think about the block reward we\u2019d need to get that amount of security, or we look at the amount we\u2019re spending and try to work out how much security we\u2019re getting. If we hold the block reward constant, we\u2019re looking at a loss of least the 3% or so that is currently going to miners, but also some amount potentially much greater than 3% in the low-ETH-value high-transacted-value worst-case. Or if we hold the desired security level constant, we need to raise the block reward not only by the 3% or so that covers the average fees, but also by some additional margin to cover the worst-case. This seems particularly relevant as this EIP is being sold in other venues (not here) as something that will reduce net ETH issuance and thus benefit holders, when in fact it seems to do the opposite. If we want to keep the proposed fee market mechanism without this effect on network security (or inflation, as you prefer) the alternative would be to put basefees into a fee pool, where they\u2019re spread among all miners mining blocks at about the same time, rather than paying them all to the miner who mines that particular block.

However, this proposal does not maximize social welfare. Additionally, this proposal is missing formal proofs for the nonmanipulation claims. In practical terms, while we don\u2019t know of a concrete attack on this mechanism right now, such miner manipulation attacks may exist and would be discovered in production. These issues were brought up and addressed in StableFees, an alternate auction mechanism that maximizes social welfare and has provable non-manipulation guarantees. In a nutshell, StableFees starts with a generalized second price auction and then adds a few rules to provably deter misbehaviors that occur in the decentralized setting that do not occur in traditional auctions. If you are curious to learn more, a more detailed overview of StableFees is given in this blog post: https://hackingdistributed.com/2019/01/22/doing-fees-right/. For more gory details and proofs, the full paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.06830.pdf. Note that StableFees does not rule out colluding behaviors. ",

I think this is a good idea, but we need to consider the fact that during this transition, the max transaction size will be significantly reduced from block-size to about half of block size at the start of the transition.  This may cause some contracts that depend on large transactions to break until the migration is far enough along that they can once again issue their large transactions. As an example, some Augur transactions can get pretty hefty, as well as some 0x transactions (batch fills though, which may be splittable). At the least, I think this should be mentioned in the backward compatibility section of the EIP. ",

I\u2019m quoting from the mining_CCS.pdf paper, highlights by me:  Once  any  non-zero  fraction  of  miners  is PettyCompliant, it enables various strategies that are more aggressive and harmful to Bitcoin consensus. We call this the undercut-ting attack, where miners will actively fork the head of the chain and leave transactions unclaimed in the hope of incentivizing PettyCompliant miners to build on their block. In some scenarios, our simulation reveals a non-equilibrium with increasingly aggressive undercutting.  But with an expanded  strategy  space,  and  suitable  assumptions,  we  are able to prove that an equilibrium exists.  However, it is one where miners include only a fraction of available transactions into their blocks.  This results in a backlog of transactions whose size grows  indefinitely  with  time. We confirm this result using simulation.  So when miners include only a fraction of available transactions into their blocks then my understanding is MINFEE would stay 0.

With 1559, MINFEE would be 0 only if a plurality of miners (exact portion changes depending on how much they sacrifice, but it can be as high as over 50%) all sacrifice profits in order to drive the fee down.  As long as they do this, any miner that defects from this strategy will be more profitable than miners executing the attack as long as the attack continues.  When the attack is no longer executed by a sufficient portion of miners, the base fee will rise back up to its correct level. This means that any miner that defects from the attack is rewarded, and any miner that participates in the attack is punished for as long as the attack is ongoing.  Also, we can adjust the portion necessary to successfully drive the base fee down by increasing the block size target.  Current EIP specifies the target as being \u201chalf full\u201d but we could just as easily target 1/4 full which would increase the hashing power required to attack the system in this way by ~2x.  The only downside of that is that we end up with bigger block size spikes and it is unclear how various client implementations will handle that so we are starting with only a 2x block size spike being possible.  Something to keep in mind is that a 1559-like fee system is sufficiently different from the system the paper is attacking that the attack no longer makes sense.  Because of this, outcomes from that paper cannot be applied to a 1559-like system directly.  If you want to describe an attack against a 1559-like system, you will need to fully describe a new attack. Imagine the situation \u201cWhen X = 1 and Y = 2 then X+Y = 3\u201d.  If you change X to equal 5, the conclusions that X+Y=5 no longer holds and you will need to re-evaluate things.  In this case, the paper is built on the premise that fees are allocated in a very specific way, and when you remove that premise the rest of the paper no longer falls out. Note: It is certainly possible that an outcome like the one described in that paper is possible, but I believe it would need a pretty significant rework to draw that conclusion. ",

In fact the incentive to game the system gets bigger.   If a miner controls 51% of hashing power then they can do some pretty bad things to Ethereum, including simply ignoring all other miner blocks to maximize their block reward.  1559 doesn\u2019t really change that in any meaningful way, and if someone wants to exploit 51% of hashing power for financial gains there are far more efficient ways to do so than driving the fee down.  Something to keep in mind is that this sort of attack is collusion resistant because there is a financial incentive to defect, and you can defect anonymously.  Because of this, it is very hard for miners to collude to execute the attack. As far as mining pools go, keep in mind that any mining pool that is executing this attack will become less profitable than a mining pool that doesn\u2019t execute the attack, which means pool participants can (and potentially will) individually defect if a mining pool is detected to be executing an attack like this.     dominic:  which aspect of 1559 specifically is the part that is disabling the mentioned attack   It is the fee burning aspect that does it.

I wouldn\u2019t call it an attack though, it\u2019s just a mining strategy # Mining only most expensive tx but less than # TARGET_GAS so that BASE_FEE goes down  SELECT * FROM TRANSACTIONS ORDER BY gas_price HAVING SUM(gas_used) < TARGET_GAS_USED    E.g. they mine exactly lower than TARGET_GAS, so the MIN_FEE can only go down, but they never have to mine empty blocks. If nobody plays their game they will have 50% less tx fees than anybody else, but the BASE_FEE will shoot up and eat most of the TX revenue anyway. So not much lost. If on the other hand more miners use this rule, the BASE_FEE will converge to it\u2019s minimum and TX_FEES will compete with BLOCK_REWARD exactly like today. Mathematical I think it\u2019s important to consider the ratio between the total block reward and the contribution of tx fees to it: REWARD = BLOCK_REWARD + TX_FESS  In Block 10041942 REWARD = 2 ETH (Block) + 0.15 ETH (Fees)  TX_FEES = 7.5%  In Block 10641942 REWARD = 2 ETH (Block) + 2.2 ETH (Fees)  TX_FEES = 53%  Giving up 50% of 0.15 in TX_FEES in the short term to gain 2.2 ETH TX_FEES in the long term seems a pretty good deal. So another strategy could be to target a certain reward % from TX fees by fixing the tip/bribe. This might have been suggested somewhere else: # Mining only tx above a certain tip threshold SELECT * FROM TRANSACTIONS ORDER BY gas_price WHERE gas_price - BASE_FEE > 100GWEI  In this different miners could be setting different tip levels, maybe based on their cost. But the effect would be the same as in strategy #1, the BASE_FEE would be damped until the minimum tip is reached. But where is that new equilibrium? Anyway the strategies become much more interesting with EIP-1559 and there are many more that could be explored. So I\u2019m super curious where it will settle. There is also a big mid-term social effect. E.g. once miners go from the current high tx fee rewards to the low expected rewards after EIP-1559 deployment with default configuration, how will they react when thinking about the \u201cgood old times\u201d when you could make 2.2 ETH from tx fees alone.

The only difference is that I find the math to be simpler if you have the attacker/coalition split their hashing power between \u201cempty blocks\u201d and \u201cdouble full blocks\u201d.  However, the arguments are no different if you instead have the miner mine a bunch of undertarget blocks instead. The summary is the same as in that article: There exist 51% attacks that are profitable for everyone who joins your attack.  51% attacks against 1559 (as described here and in the article) are non-profitable for any individual who joins the attack.  It is always better to not participate in the attack and instead just encourage others attack (so you can benefit from the attack without having to pay the cost). ",

Moreover, let g_{n+1} = g_n + M/2 - w_n, that is, g += excess. It can be proved that, the limit of f_n as the initial reserve g_0 goes to infinity is given by:  the Almgren-Chriss additive formula in the case of constant sum market maker, and your proposed exponential formula in the case of constant product market maker.  This observation immediately implies that both of these update rules (and any other one based on another constant function market maker) are path independet. Ironically, this is exactly why we have arrived at these formulas in the first place when attempting to solve a simple instance of path dependence attacks. ",

One need to also look at past confirmed transactions of the day for calling the contract with the right parameters. Currently, if someone broadcasts a transaction fee higher than yours, you cancel your transaction by rebroadcasting it with a higher fee than your competitor using nonce. As of course, other will do the same so the aim is to maintain being the highest bidder as long as possible until blocktime is reached. Each call to web3/Etherscan involves a 200ms latency in addition to the latency of the network. A time during which your competitor is still the first. Of course, a local http node makes this better but ipc involves an even lower latency. So it s about detecting and replacing as fast as possible. ",

Block ordering with 1559 (all versions discussed) is still gas price order.  If you want to be at the top of the block, pay a higher gas price.  Nothing is changing on this front.     ytrezq:  I also assume if the 2 transaction types are mixed that there would be no possibility to influence the transaction ordering between the types If I m not the miner.   This is entirely up to miners.  I don\u2019t know what the clients are planning on implementing if we go with 2 transaction pools (a version of the specification that I don\u2019t think anyone actively wants), but it isn\u2019t a consensus concern and miners can change the behavior if they want (as they can now). Transaction ordering is entirely at the whim of miners, who sometimes defer the decision client developers.  Prior to 1559, transaction inclusion was entirely at the whim of miners, but 1559 makes it so inclusion is partly miners, and partly consensus.  However, as long as something is valid to include, miners can still choose to include it and how to order it just as they can now. ",

As some devs have stated, I also agree its important to state the case outside of \u201cOh, no, miners will lose revenue!\u201d So this is my attempt to flesh it all out. This tweak proposed by Vitalik regarding 1559 keeps miners incentivized to mine the chain during crypto valleys. Miners who have many liabilities have mined in the past because they expected better returns in the form of tx fees in the future. EIP 1559 as it stands, burns fees and erases that long-term incentive to build or maintain infrastructure earlier than anticipated. This is fine on its own as miners expected this for some time. However, it doesn\u2019t replace it with another plausible security mechanism (i.e. PoS). It merely cripples the existing one. If there is another crypto winter before ETH is full 2.0, there is no reason for miners to keep the lights on this time, and hash rate will plummet or be concentrated into the hands of the chip makers. Furthermore, this \u201cflattened\u201d tx fee payout adds an additional incentive that many says GPU coins lack when compared to ASIC chains - an incentive to remain on ETH long term despite having other options to mine. If there is a spike in tx fees, we can expect ETH to payout more over a longer period of time, and this will increase net security over a longer time. I think it is important to have GPU\u2019s be the preferred choice of mining hardware because it allows for the broadest group of participants (among other reasons). These hobbyists, students, businessmen, etc become the companies, evangelists, and developers that are building on and awareness of Ethereum. If no action is to be taken on ASIC\u2019s, EIP 1559 with a flattened fee structure will help ensure that ETH will be the most attractive (read: secure) blockchain with consumer grade hardware, and help keep mining decentralized by providing a larger and more stable stream of income despite the lower earnings created by specialized hardware players Ethereum\u2019s yellow paper pledged to defend against. I think most miners (myself included) would champion this EIP without question if ProgPoW were implemented, but there are just too many hands in the cookie jar and its squeezing honest mining companies, even those with the most competitive power rates on the market. If EIP 1559 is implemented as is and burns tx fees, miners will feel the squeeze from the developers and from ASIC manufacturers, there will be no reason to hold out for a better future as we know ETH 2.0 is coming, and all that will remain competitive mining ETH are the ASIC chips that have priced GPU miners out of business. I fear this is bad news for the future of ETH as it consolidates voting power into fewer hands who may be hostile towards ETH\u2019s future plans. Every GPU miner I have met online or not is not hostile towards this larger shift. As I have said many times around the interwebz; let\u2019s not dismantle the old house before the new one is built. And finally, while I appreciate the effort being put forth, I also think that Tim Beiko\u2019s summary on EIP 1559 disregards miners as an ETH stakeholder and that kinda sucks. I get that we are squeezed in this proposal so its politically expedient to write us off, but I think conversations around EIP 1559 should capture our discontent accurately, so that our concerns can be fleshed out as we are best positioned to explain what negative, unintended consequences the mining industry (read: security) would experience if economic policies are shifted. At the end of the day, it comes across as silly to me to light piles of money on fire as a result of more economic activity so that we can hope that the money in our pockets is worth more afterwards. I hope that these concerns stoke further conversation on this topic. ",

It ensures ETH has the highest has in its class of mining hardware (GPU\u2019s) which ensures no 51% attack, even if ETH\u2019s inflation rate is lower than a future competing chain. Furthermore, if miners are paid 1/1000(0?)th of the accumulated tx fees/block, it incentivizes security over the long run despite other negative factors (some addressable) that are harmful for long term network security. I think it is bad economic/monetary policy to contract and expand the money supply based on something as volatile and multi-factored as revenues of miners measured in fiat. For example, rollups will likely remove many on chain tx fees even before EIP 1559 is implemented, so using today\u2019s fees as a basis for reducing mining rewards even further seems disingenuous to me.

In such a case, just adjusting the issuance rate directly seems to be far simpler, and even more predictable, than trying to distribute it to miners.

They want the fees reduced in 1.0 not 2.0 when they will be staking using the coins they stole. So now we have come full circle. Remember the dev call where Defi members stormed the meeting, insulted devs and miners, and stated they would cause a chain split if a fork was made to remove ASICs? Maybe they should have had a little more respect for those of us who have been here since day one, protecting the network. Like I have said before gas fees can be reduced easily by January. Change Ethash algo, take ASICs off the network and GPU miners will agree to ETH issuance reduction equal to increase in rewards after 30 days stability in hash. Maybe the Defi community needs to learn how to work with the miners instead of insisting they get everything they want while the rest of us must wait and take pay cuts. ",

Not changing the mining algo because changing it would admit publicly that Ethash failed from keeping ASICs off the network and hurt the reputation of Vitalik who developed it? Isn\u2019t this why only a few devs have made serious attempts to replace it in the last 3 years? Does one person really wield this much power and control over what is supposed to be a decentralized coin? ",

For example, if the fee is fixed at 0.1%, a 1 ETH transfer would be charged 0.001 ETH, and a 1000 ETH transfer would be 1 ETH. The percentage doesn\u2019t need to be fixed, could be a sliding scale depending on amount. This would be equivalent to the base fee, and a tip could still be added. Was this part of the discussion for EIP-1559 before this thread? Or maybe it\u2019s part of another EIP? Charging a fixed base fee is fantastic for whales and good for most users but doesn\u2019t necessarily work for all.

Unfortunately like you say the GPU mining community is made mostly of small miners (hobbyists) if you will. They don\u2019t typically get involved in the inner workings of Ethereum and are difficult to mobilize. This is unlike the Defi community that are very poweful, largely funded, and highly organized. It is this disparity why we continue to see EIPs like 1559 moving forward, hurting the small guys, to benefit the powerful who want to game Ethereum by \u201cyield farming\u201d\u2026making very large transactions as fast as possible to gain the highest yield. It is not always the loudest voices that speak for the entire community as a whole. Sometimes the smallest voices are the real community that represent the largest number of people. We should try to be quiet and listen to what they are saying, perhaps more importantly what they are not. ",

Why are you working so hard on changing mining sorting when POW is approaching end of life? Remember EIP-1559 is supposed to be included in POS as well.   If you are so intent on making changes to miners, please merge with EIP-1057. Otherwise EIP-1559 will not be approved by miners and cause a contentious chain split.   Miners are gearing up for a full blown push to stop EIP-1559 if it does not include an algo change to remove ASICs. This will push this project well into 2022 where it becomes irrelevant anyway as POS is implemented on mainnet.   Mica the talking down to miners (@50:50) needs to stop. We have tried patiently for three years to remove ASICs from the network and the Defi team recently stopped it saying it would cause a chain split. You are obviously ignoring this as a valid reason when ASICs go completely against the Yellow Paper, to prevent ASICs from running on the network. The last number was over 45% of the network are ASICs.   Even without mempool sorting changes your best bet is to reach out to the GPU mining community and partner with them early to prevent a failure of this EIP.

                    "content": "Ethereum is supposed to be a world computer, not a store-of-value-ponzi-scheme. The EIP, as it is now, reeks of greed and does nothing but damage Ethereum\u2019s reputation. Solve it by removing the basefee burning, it is unnecessary! The remaining changes still bring the projected network benefits! From the EIP:  An important aspect of this fee system is that miners only get to keep the miner bribe. The base fee is always burned (i.e. it is destroyed by the protocol). Burning this is important because it removes miner incentive to manipulate the fee in order to extract more fees from users. It also ensures that only ETH can ever be used to pay for transactions on Ethereum, cementing the economic value of ETH within the Ethereum platform. Additionally, this burn counterbalances Ethereum inflation without greatly diminishing miner rewards.  Trying to (disingenuously) create deflation while surrounding it with phrases such as \u201ccementing the economic value of ETH\u201d leaves a really bad taste in many people\u2019s mouths. Also, language wise, the term \u201cminer bribe\u201d really solidifies the preconception that developers absolutely detest miners (more commonly tips or gas premium). Not to mention that (trying to) create deflation in this way would actually hurt Ethereum:  With all the Ether currently being locked in by stakers/investors/HODLers we need the liquidity! The amount of Ether available on exchanges is already decreasing rapidly [1]. Low exchange liquidity + Rising prices + High \u2018investor\u2019 transaction volume -> No available Ether + No Transaction-space -> No DApps -> Just another shitcoin. The more Ethereum 1.0 is pushed to become a \u2018store-of-value\u2019 (by EIPs like this) the harder it becomes to be a world computer. More investor transactions mean less DApp transactions on an already congested network. Trying to unnecessarily nickel-and-dime miners out of their expected reward seems like a really bad idea. From what I have seen, the majority of the miners seem to have already accepted that mining stops once PoS is deemed ready. Going to war with them now while they are still needed for the final stretch to PoS is a needless risk.  And finally, the EIP projects changes without actually arguing in favor of them. The final sentence of the motivation part:  Additionally, this burn counterbalances Ethereum inflation without greatly diminishing miner rewards.  Seems to imply that counterbalancing inflation is a good thing(?), but it gives no arguments! I thought this was an Ethereum Improvement Proposal. In fact, from the \u201csecurity considerations\u201d section:  By burning the base fee, we can no longer guarantee a fixed token supply. This could result in economic instabality as the long term supply of ETH will no longer be constant over time. While a valid concern, it is difficult to quantify how much of an impact this will have.  \u201cIt is difficult to quantify how much of an impact this will have\u201d, but we are pushing for it anyway LOL! It is not hard to see that the only tangible benefit of deflation (or lower inflation) is for entities speculating on the price of Ether. The basefee burning should be moved to a different EIP entirely (Working title: Let\u2019s create deflation to pump our bags!). If pushing for monetary changes masked as network improvements is the new standard then we might as well drop the pretense, rename Ethereum to \u2018Bitcoin2\u2019, replace this forum with a meme feed about \u2018Mooning lambo\u2019s\u2019 and start shouting Etherconneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeect.

                    "content": "I\u2019m a little surprised not to see more discussion about some good points people like veox and editor-Ajian have raised above regarding the economics of this proposal. To put it succinctly, whether this proposal is accepted or not, the price of transactions during a time of congestion is going to continue to be driven by the equilibrium conditions between supply and demand for block real estate.  Assume, for instance, that at a time of congestion there are 10x more users in need to submit urgent transactions than there is room for in the subsequent blocks.  As is the case now, users will have no choice but to compete with each other, hiking up their miner fees in order to make sure that their respective transactions are executed timely, causing the gas price to go up until all but a tenth of them are priced out, i.e. until the equilibrium between supply and demand is reestablished. This new equilibrium price is only dependent on the utility of executing a transaction to the individual users, the amount of ether they have to spend, and on the available supply of block space (AKA its gas weight limit).  It\u2019s fully irrelevant how we designate the different components of the transaction fee (base fee, miner tip or bribe), the equilibrium gas price during a period of congestion is going to be the same for a given level of supply.  Even more irrelevant for the equilibrium price is what eventually happens to the different components of the fee after it leaves the user\u2019s wallet: Whether it\u2019s burned, transferred directly to the miner or pooled in order to create a more stable mining incentive. That brings me to the aspect of this proposal which IMHO is likely to have a significantly positive impact on transaction prices: The increase of the block gas limit.  There is no doubt that greater supply of this scarce resource will alleviate gas price surges during times of congestion, so that\u2019s definitely a welcome improvement that\u2019s likely to benefit most of the community. But as @kladkogex and others have pointed out earlier, I fail to see the logical necessity of conflating the increase in transaction capacity (which in itself would likely be acceptable and welcome to most people in this discussion) with a fee structure change (i.e. the breakdown into base fee and miner tip, including a rule for calculating the former built into the protocol which might arguably deviate from optimality) and a monetary policy change (i.e. the decision to burn that fraction of the transaction fee instead of giving it to its current beneficiary).  No wonder this has turned out to be rather controversial. I found @vbuterin 's paper /Blockchain Resource Pricing/ quite helpful to better understand the motivation for those changes, but it still seems unfortunate to me that this is being done as a single all-or-nothing proposal, because each of the points I mentioned above has potentially far-reaching implications (e.g. due to the delayed nature of the base fee computation it can conceivably lead to an increase in gas prices on the average, relative to a network with comparable capacity which doesn\u2019t impose base fees, in stark conflict with the general intention of this proposal) or rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify, either experimentally or in a simulation (e.g. if my understanding is correct the primary motivation for moving away from a gas supply cap in favor of a set gas price seems to be the promise of better economic efficiency under the assumption that the marginal social cost has much lower slope in absolute value than the demand function, this is however exceedingly difficult to test due to the non-linear behavior of the social cost function, and it wouldn\u2019t be unexpected for the opposite to hold true past a tipping point that allows a critical level of centralization to be reached that enables a large-scale attack to be committed on the network, not unlike the behavior of the social cost function of carbon emissions @vbuterin mentions in his article). If we have reasons to believe that such a catastrophic tipping point won\u2019t be reached within the gas limit range [Wmax,Wnewmax], maybe there is no reason for the increase in block capacity everyone is waiting for to remain blocked by the more controversial/problematic bits of this proposal (Incidentally such a simpler change bumping the gas limit to Wnewmax alone would deliver lower gas fees than this EIP on the average, since no base fee would be imposed to the user anytime). If people consider that the sudden jump to Wnewmax=2*Wmax would run the risk to overwhelm full node administrators maybe the gas limit could be increased by a more modest fraction while still delivering gas prices close enough to this proposal.  Or a simpler mechanism could be implemented to provide the guarantee that the average block size never exceeds Wmax while still allowing comparable elasticity to this proposal, by carrying a running (e.g. exponential) average of the gas usage per block and requiring valid blocks to maintain it below Wmax (which would have a far more deterministic behavior than relying on market feedback mechanisms in order to achieve a similar effect). Apologies for the long reply, I truly did my best to keep it succinctly, maybe another symptom of too many things going on at once here  ",

It is the exact same style of degenerate governance that you describe: Fill a proposal with positive changes (UX improvements, better auction efficiency, variable block size, etc.) then slip in an unneeded personal gain at the end (basefee burning). The paper by Tim Roughgarden literally proves that EIP-1559 with the \u2113-Smoothed Mechanism (where block rewards are still effectively paid to miners, just \u2113 blocks later) provides the exact same benefits as \u2018vanilla\u2019 EIP-1559.[1, page 41, section 8.3.2]. In fact, the same paper places a suddenly very relevant caveat by EIP-1559 as it is currently proposed. I am just going to paste the wall of text because more users on here need to read this (from page 37, section 7.6 (emphases mine)):  Because of the burned base fee revenues, many miners appear to view EIP-1559 as taking away some of their profits and handing them over to ETH holders. For example, of the nine miners responding to a questionnaire by Beiko [12], six wrote that \u201cthey would not implement it under any circumstances.\u201d  This strong negative reaction suggests that EIP-1559 may galvanize miners to sustain collusion to a degree not yet seen under the status quo. An immediate issue is miner adoption, and the plan for the deployment and acceptance of EIP-1559 should be explicitly discussed.  For example, can the Ethereum Foundation effectively dictateits use?  Or is the plan to first secure support from major projects built on top of Ethereum (e.g.,the USDC stable coin), thereby forcing miners\u2019 hands? Or should further support from miners besought out directly, and perhaps explicitly incentivized? A second concern is that the 1559 mechanism\u2019s fee burn could change the norms around what types of miner collusion are culturally acceptable (e.g., coordinating on a new maximum block size) versus  unacceptable  (e.g.,  a  censorship  attack).   For  example,  imagine  that  miners  coordinated their actions to avoid the base fee but otherwise acted as in a first-price auction with a maximum  People here need to get some sense, this collusion has already started. Miners are already slowly banding together and EIP-1559 has not been officially planned for inclusion in a hard fork yet. Imagine the shitstorm when it is. The conclusion is obvious: EIP-1559 should go forward with the \u2113-Smoothed Mechanism. Risking delay (or even rejection) of  all the great improvements that the EIP brings on something as contentious as basefee burning while it is not a requirement is just bad governance. After this is done, and the EIP-1559 benefits are locked in, people are always free to make a new EIP where they propose basefee burning again. Then we can have a proper discussion where it is actually the main topic from the start, not some hidden afterthought. [1] http://timroughgarden.org/papers/eip1559.pdf ",

The base fee is required in 1559 to solve the UX problem of gas price estimation. The base fee cannot go to the miner of the block because that creates an incentive misalignment. The base fee can be burnt, or it could be sent to a dev fund, or it could be distributed to future block miners. Burning is incredibly simple. Distributing the base fee to future block miners is quite complicated. Burning has a minor benefit that it gives the core developers and community more precise control over the amount we pay for security/hashing power. If we believe that it is necessary to pay miners more (for any reason), we can do so via increased block rewards which is very easy.  ",

Otherwise we are assuming that no one is in a hurry, everyone pays just base fee, no txs get mined, the base fee drops and the miners include those transactions, which is not only an unlikely scenario but also highly inefficient. Under those assumptions, we are in the same situation as before. UX is complicated because you have to include a tip, and the tip market becomes the new fee market.

The base fee cannot go to the miner of the block because that creates an incentive misalignment. The base fee can be burnt, or it could be sent to a dev fund, or it could be distributed to future block miners.    Yes, I\u2019m aware (good to mention for clarification I guess).     MicahZoltu:   Burning is incredibly simple. Distributing the base fee to future block miners is quite complicated.    This is humor right? EIP-1559 (if ever implemented, \u2113-smoothed or not) is arguably the most complex change since genesis. New transaction struct, variable block size, overhauling block validation, replacing a simple auction with a multi-layered one that not only changes transaction fees but (as it currently stands) also changes the entire monetary policy (though no one knows exactly to what degree) while simultaneously flipping off the people that secure the network. Not to mention the resulting risky changes in clients, inter-compatibility, bugs and testnet time needed for implementing and validating all of the above. Oh and of course the UX changes. I mean, the goal is obviously not simplicity here. besides, the  \u2113-smoothed mechanism does not seem overly complex. The paper already implies a nice structure. Block validation could be done efficiently by maintaining a sliding window over the \u2018gas_target\u2019 and \u2018base_fee\u2019 fields of the last \u2113 blocks (better a couple more than \u2113 to prevent long validation in case of uncles/forks). The \u2018paid-forward base fee\u2019 calculation has equal weights on all blocks so it could be implemented using a simple moving average.     MicahZoltu:   Burning has a minor benefit that it gives the core developers and community more precise control over the amount we pay for security/hashing power.    And this minor benefit of imaginary \u2018control\u2019 is worth destabilizing the whole monetary policy for?     MicahZoltu:   If we believe that it is necessary to pay miners more (for any reason), we can do so via increased block rewards which is very easy.    Nah, the miners are being paid according to the functional code that is out there today. Proponents of EIP-1559 should be arguing why they propose to screw them over, not the other way around. Again, it\u2019s an Ethereum Improvement Proposal is it not? A growing group of people seem to think that basefee burning is not improving anything. ",

What will happen under EIP-1559 at times when the number of users trying to send a transaction ASAP greatly exceeds the available block capacity?  Won\u2019t they have to compete by increasing their miner tips until the point that demand drops to match the existing block capacity?  Exactly as is the case today, and needing exactly the same fee estimation algorithms that are in use today in order to give the user a chance for their transaction to be mined during a period of congestion, since there is no protocol mechanism in place to prevent the miner tip from going up to 100%, 1000% of the base fee whenever too many users are in a rush at any point. I agree, though, that by the time the period of congestion recedes the base fee will have caught up to some extent, and from that point on it will begin to drop slowly, creating an artificial floor to transaction prices \u2013 In other words, the base fee might be effective at reducing the volatility of gas prices (though the gas estimation problem for clients to solve is not fundamentally changed in any way), but only at the cost of artificially increasing gas prices once the congestion period is over (!). Why is a change meant to reduce gas price volatility at the cost of increasing transaction prices being shoved into an EIP meant to reduce transaction prices for everybody?

I\u2019m glad to see some work attempting to verify the economic assumptions behind this proposal. Unfortunately I haven\u2019t found anything among the simulation notebooks linked there that would be able to answer the question I\u2019ve been asking to myself:  Will the imposition of a base fee lead to higher gas prices on the average (compared to the massively simpler alternative of modestly increasing the block gas limit)? All the simulation work I\u2019ve come across so far focuses on comparing the performance of legacy vs. EIP-1559-aware transaction users in a post-EIP-1559 world, but that doesn\u2019t answer the question of whether the introduction of a base fee in itself is doing any favor to us transaction users on the average, it only tells us that adopting the canonical post-EIP-1559 fee estimation strategy has certain advantages over continuing to send legacy transactions in an EIP-1559 world (which isn\u2019t surprising since legacy users are still required to pay the base fee even though without EIP-1559 they would have been able to bid below it).  Some objective comparison between this proposal and the feasible alternatives seems badly needed (Feel free to provide a link if some work has already been done in that area, I\u2019m very interested to see the results).

                    "content": "EIP-1559 put simply:   Passing Yield Farming Costs onto the rest of the community - It allows Yield Farmers to push the costs of doing thousands of transactions in each block onto the normal users of the blockchain that are just sending coins. This is done by averaging the gas cost over time to prevent a spike in fees that would normally have to be paid by the Yield Farmer. This will just allow them to make more transactions before the costs go up, except once the average goes up they stop and the rest of the community is now paying a very slowly decaying transaction cost. Once it comes back down to a low level Yield Farmers spring back into action again and push it slowly back up. This is different than it is right now and the spikes in fees go up and come down relatively fast and are paid for immediately by the perpetrators.  Burning the BASEFEE is Pyramid scheme for Yield Famers While it is being sold to be done to prevent miners from manipulating fees, the real reason is to ensure the rise in the BASEFEE due to Yield Farming is used to remove excess Ethereum from the system. This has the effect of reducing Ethereum coins per the coins being farmed in terms of the BASEFEE. IE the farmed coins will be worth more after the BASEFEE is allowed to go back down.  1559 was made to benefit sophisticated computer driven trading systems designed to take advantage of BASEFEE vs Farmed Coins yields that can run thousands of transactions in a single block. This is Wallstreet Flash Traders wanting to change Ethereum so they can do thousands of transactions in a block and pass the majority of the costs onto others while taking the rightful profits away from the miners.

What he is trying to say is 1559 will only reduce fees for yield farmers that are dumping thousands of transactions into a block and then not pay the extra fees to miners. Additionally if the yield farmers do this for an extended period the fees WILL go up for everyone and then slowly come back down since it is an average over time. What is also not being told is this change will cause a huge explosion in yield farming and WILL result in higher BASEFEEs as the average goes up and will then establish a new floor and ceiling based solely on farming profitability. Of course the counter argument is there is no way to predict the impact. Bottom line is if something becomes extremely profitable, those who have the resources (systems than can do thousands of transactions per block) will take full advantage of it. ",

Gas price reduction comes with either reduced demand for block space (rollups) or increased block space (sharding).   Thank you for stating that clearly, there is plenty of confusion floating around the internet in this regard.  May I ask what the practical benefit of this will be to the end user? (to the majority of us unlucky enough to have arrived too late to the party to have had the chance to amass a large quantity of ether that would appreciate significantly from its deflationary effect  ) I understand that it will reduce the variance of gas prices (which admittedly has been rather annoying to me during the last few months), but if that comes at the cost of increasing average gas prices in the long run I think I personally prefer to keep the variance, as any frequent enough transaction user probably would, because variance tends to cancel out over time (as in the Law of large numbers), while any increase in the average gas prices would add up over time.     MicahZoltu:  EIP-1559 is expected to leave users with approximately the same gas price on average, with maybe a small decrease due to gas pricing efficiency improvements enabled by EIP-1559 (so people no longer over-estimate gas prices).   How can imposing a minimum gas price ever lead to a reduction in prices in a competitive market?  Isn\u2019t it worth considering the possibility that it might have an effect opposite to the intended, as one would intuitively expect from the imposition of a minimum price?  Just so we can avoid unpleasant surprises down the road. ",

The expectation is that even during times of rapidly increasing congestion, the rate of change of the base fee should be fast enough such that blocks return to \u201cnot full\u201d rather quickly.

I would love to gain a better understanding of the reasoning behind that. Is there any material in the list of resources you linked above addressing this point in particular?   I don\u2019t believe so.  It is expected to be a pretty small effect so I don\u2019t think anyone has devoted much resources to it besides just thinking about it and mentioning it in passing. Right now, many users use historic fees as their mechanism for setting their gas price.  This results in users over-bidding for block space during times of decreasing demand and under-bidding for block space during times of increasing demand.  These two situations should approximately cancel each other out over the long run, but it is possible that we\u2019ll see a bigger gain on the way down instead of the way up because users generally want to save money and thus they have a preference for underbidding rather than overbidding. It is also possible that once we give people the ability to bid their full marginal utility without fear of overpaying, we\u2019ll see people who previously would have bid once, failed, then given up now instead declare a very high marginal utility and eventually get included.  Note: This argument is essentially saying that by making Ethereum easier to use, demand for block space on Ethereum may increase.  Arguing against it is basically saying, \u201clets keep Ethereum hard to use in order to discourage people from using it\u201d which tends to not go over very well with investors or product developers.

Even bots who are doing pending queue monitoring can fail at gas price estimation from time to time.   One of the most common complaints I\u2019ve heard of the user experience with Ethereum is \u201ctransactions are prohibitively expensive\u201d, even more frequently than \u201cthe gas oracle messed up and my transaction got stuck\u201d.  If this is trading the interests of one group of transaction users in favor of the other it will be worsening their user experience, even if you\u2019re right at the end of the day and it\u2019s only slightly so.     MicahZoltu:  Even during times of increasing congestion, 1559 improves the UX for any user who isn\u2019t in an extreme hurry to be included.

The problem I see here is that there is a necessary trade-off between our ability to take advantage of the doubled block size (which is the one aspect of this proposal I find unquestionably helpful, since it should keep gas prices from skyrocketing as quickly when there is a short-lived surge of demand) and the short-term accuracy of the base fee.  Allow the base fee to change too quickly (which yeah is good for usability) and you\u2019ll reduce the timespan over which short surges of demand can be averaged out without the gas price going up to similar levels as it does today.  Allow it to change too slowly (which should decrease the frequency of transient spikes in the gas price) and you increase the likelihood of reverting back to a first-price auction of miner bribes (which means clients have to continue dealing with the same difficulties of gas price estimation in order to be ready for such a scenario).  Once again we\u2019ve hit a trade-off between the interests of users seeking lower gas prices and the ones preferring an easy-to-use pricing mechanism.     MicahZoltu:  You can set your maximum fee to whatever your personal limit is and you\u2019ll eventually be included (ignoring pool eviction issues) should the demand for block space ever dip below that (assuming your max inclusion fee is higher than miner opportunity cost for including transactions). This is the same as today.   Sure, but the question is whether rational transaction users would be able to take greater advantage of temporary drops of demand without such a smoothly-varying price floor.  I think we agree that the existence of a base fee imposes a constraint on how low successful bids can be (the slower the base fee averaging the greater the constraint) without significantly reducing the prices users will have to pay during a period of high demand (unless the base fee averaging is slow enough to allow the double-size block to absorb the spike of demand effectively \u2013 Oops another trade-off!).  Wouldn\u2019t it be worth examining the possibility of this increased price floor leading to increased gas prices in some quantitative fashion?     MicahZoltu:  EIP-1559 does not try to fix gas cost issues. Rollups and sharding are the long term solution to those problems. Other solutions may be possible, but they are unrelated to the problem being solved by EIP-1559.   I find both problems to be somewhat interconnected because any improvement delivering a reduction in gas prices also has quite some chances of improving the user experience, reducing delays and frequency of stuck transactions \u2013 Even if it remains a matter of guesswork to find the correct gas price, simply because it increases the range of gas prices that the user is willing to pay and can successfully make it into the blockchain.  Also because it seems to be fairly challenging to come up with a solution for such usability issues that doesn\u2019t address the underlying supply problem and doesn\u2019t make anyone worse off.  I wholeheartedly agree that rollups and sharding are the real long-term solutions to those problems (but also, to a large extent, to this problem).  I\u2019m excited to see how sharding works out, can\u2019t wait for Ethereum 2.0 to be fully functional  ",

                    "content": "Hi @mdalembert, you may be interested in these simulations (see also others here). The gist is that we model first-price auction users (the current paradigm), then 1559 users, and observe how gas price oracles and user fees vary. It doesn\u2019t exactly answer your question but it could be modified  to. Yet there might be some insights from it that are applicable here. Gas price oracles are basically noisy + laggy estimators of an invisible \u201cmarket price\u201d, that equalises supply and demand. The way oracles are modelled, they tend to be sticky because if everyone is overpaying, oracles will keep quoting high prices (reflexivity). That\u2019s a known effect of these first-price auction type of systems, that you usually strategise based on what you assume of other users. (by the way EthGasStation has a bunch of checks to break this reflexivity as much as possible, but the point stands that estimation still depends on past users) With 1559, you are quoted a market price, so usually you can either take it or leave it, no need to check what others are doing. When you have users who are underbidding (like LegacyUsers in the \u201cFinal boss\u201d section of the notebook), they can still get in given the right circumstances (basefee needs to come down enough), but they should expect their wait time to be greater. So I think Micah is right when he says that 1559 narrows the band: you have less users underpaying, but also less users overpaying.     mdalembert:  Allow the base fee to change too quickly (which yeah is good for usability) and you\u2019ll reduce the timespan over which short surges of demand can be averaged out without the gas price going up to similar levels as it does today. Allow it to change too slowly (which should decrease the frequency of transient spikes in the gas price) and you increase the likelihood of reverting back to a first-price auction of miner bribes (which means clients have to continue dealing with the same difficulties of gas price estimation in order to be ready for such a scenario).   This is also a good point and some work is done on formalising arguments to help set how fast/slow basefee changes should be. Realistically mainnet data will be necessary to see how the mechanism behaves in practice, and where we fall on that tradeoff. But I never really thought of it in terms of the tradeoff being more permissive to users who underbid, seems like an interesting thread to explore. ",

This is technically simplest but also suggested to be done through another EIP (so it can be dismissed separately). It favors miners more than the rest of the network Proposed banking and redistributing base fee with a long window average - protects the risk of fee manipulation by driving cost of such manipulation much higher than rewards, and spreading rewards over the entire network. Most consistent with status quo in terms of economic policy - fair for miners and devs, but has (minor) implemention complexity. Redistribute base fee to next / previous block as others had proposed. More complexity and risk, same economic policy. Raise block rewards, but below the amount of base fee expected to be burnt. I personally don\u2019t like the ambiguity and guess work involved in this one - good for miners with a win for the other side as it slightly increases deflationary aspects. Very low complexity Split base fee between a reward portion and burnt portion - with ratio changing over time. Most consistent with the goals of phasing down rewards, essentially a \u201ctx fee ice age\u201d. IMHO probably the worst for miners that they may still tolerate.

As such, gaining some sense of concensus that one or more options may gain traction would be nice. My favorite is banking the fee and distributing it over a long rolling window as it maintains the same economic policy as the present while explicitly not disturbing the stated motivations of 1559. Open questions would be the exact mechanism for doing this, as well as how many blocks long that rolling window should be. This will require some simulations and exploratory work. Someone else can easily create a simple EIP proposing the block reward increase. I recommend at least some cursory analysis of expected future fees under 1559 and the net inflationary or deflationary effect of the recommended increase. In my opinion raising the reward is deceptively technically simple but quite complex and nuanced in the range of effects it could have on economic aspects. The same can be said to some degree with implementing 1559 without mitigation, though the window of possible effects likely shifts towards deflationary. Redistributing fees may require more technical work but the effects are very predictable and consistent. ",

Without a vote the argument is just aggression (there are many of us and few of you) Miners are the only guys who actually did vote.

In addition to being aggressive (I think Micah\u2019s blog says \u201cwe need to aggressively \u2026\u201d), the argument is weak because miners can fork the network anytime and hire engineers to maintain it.

The problem with authoritarian systems based on power is that they are always better than democracy short term but always fail long term. It is good miners had this vote, now we know who thinks what.

Anonymous is obviously the must because many people are employees, and the opinion may be against the employer\u2019s opinion. Do we  have a proof that every single geth contributor supports the EIP.

It doesn\u2019t exactly answer your question but it could be modified to. Yet there might be some insights from it that are applicable here.   Hey @barnabe, it should certainly be possible to modify some of those simulation notebooks in order to answer the questions I was asking. Unfortunately as-is they only seem to suggest that adopting the canonical EIP-1559 bidding strategy gives the user certain advantages over sticking to legacy transactions under the assumption that we do switch to EIP-1559 (and even that doesn\u2019t seem 100% clear from your results since one can see legacy transactions using the low-cost gas oracle get a slightly lower price than EIP-1559-aware users, despite them being forced to pay for the base fee like anyone else). In order to answer the question of whether EIP-1559 is going to improve things overall one would have to repeat the simulation without the imposition of a base fee, and then compare the results based on some more or less objective cost/benefit metric \u2013 And there is already quite some potential for disagreement trying to find the right metric, because users on a tight budget (like me  ) are likely to place more weight on their average transaction cost, while novice users with a low risk tolerance are more likely to prefer more deterministic transaction confirmation times even if it comes at the cost of higher gas fees. In addition it would be beneficial to simulate alternative scenarios to EIP-1559 (like the banking and moving-average redistribution of base fees other people have been requesting, which I agree would have the benefit of making the inflationary/deflationary behavior of the currency more deterministic).  In particular I have a hunch that even a slight increase in the block gas limits would yield a greater improvement in average gas costs than this proposal, and a reduction in confirmation times that could get close to what this proposal achieves for most users thanks to the increased network throughput, simultaneously improving both metrics I was discussing above instead of trading one for the other.     barnabe:  Gas price oracles are basically noisy + laggy estimators of an invisible \u201cmarket price\u201d, that equalises supply and demand. The way oracles are modelled, they tend to be sticky because if everyone is overpaying, oracles will keep quoting high prices (reflexivity). That\u2019s a known effect of these first-price auction type of systems, that you usually strategise based on what you assume of other users. (by the way EthGasStation has a bunch of checks to break this reflexivity as much as possible, but the point stands that estimation still depends on past users)   Yep, that\u2019s very true, but it\u2019s also true that real gas oracles use algorithms substantially more sophisticated than what has been used in the simulations I\u2019ve had the chance to read through so far.  In order to obtain a fair comparison of this proposal vs. the status quo it seems necessary to model some of the mempool dependency of the current oracles at the very least, and I have the suspicion that that would already reduce the stickyness you have observed in your results to some extent (though I agree that it\u2019s unlikely to fully disappear, but that might be acceptable if despite the increased stickiness users get lower transaction fees overall!). Another interesting experiment to try out (roughly converse to your modelling of legacy users in an EIP-1559 network) would be to model the present protocol in combination with a less sticky gas oracle consisting of an off-chain implementation of the base fee, taking advantage of mempool information in order to make base fee adjustments instead of relying on the gas utilization of the double block.  If that truly leads to a less reflexive gas price estimator users may have a personal incentive to opt in, avoiding the controversial aspect of imposing a base fee on everyone (However it would certainly increase the risk that those users would have to resubmit transactions compared to the present proposal).     barnabe:  This is also a good point and some work is done on formalising arguments to help set how fast/slow basefee changes should be. Realistically mainnet data will be necessary to see how the mechanism behaves in practice, and where we fall on that tradeoff. But I never really thought of it in terms of the tradeoff being more permissive to users who underbid, seems like an interesting thread to explore.   Yeah.  I think it would be beneficial to have some quantitative understanding of how optimal the selected averaging parameter actually is.  Many people seem to think that this proposal will reduce the frequency of large gas price surges thanks to the doubled block size, and that it will improve the user experience by moving away from first-price auctions as pricing mechanism.  What is not so clear in the various explanations of EIP-1559 is that there is a necessary trade-off between both of the promised advantages, that can be quantified with the averaging weight of the base fee.  It might be challenging to find the right balance between both because, once again, more budget-oriented users are likely to benefit from a slower average while more risk-averse users are likely to prefer a faster average.  Any idea what sort of metric the proposed value of this parameter was intended to optimize? (Assuming that it is the result of some sort of quantitative analysis) ",

                    "content": "These are excellent points, thank you!     mdalembert:  and even that doesn\u2019t seem 100% clear from your results since one can see legacy transactions using the low-cost gas oracle get a slightly lower price than EIP-1559-aware users, despite them being forced to pay for the base fee like anyone else   So when legacy users do get a smaller price (compared to other 1559 users who appeared at the same time), it is at the cost of a longer delay, which I guess is fine if you don\u2019t have time preferences and just want the transaction to get in, sooner or later. There is also an asymmetry in the behaviour of 1559 users, they are modelled as \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d: either the current basefee allows their inclusion or they balk. But they could be modelled as sending their bid anyways, with maxfee lower than the current basefee, in which case I might expect the results would look closer to legacy users (they wait in the pool until basefee reduces and miners include them).     mdalembert:  one would have to repeat the simulation without the imposition of a base fee   Yes this is the change that was on my mind. Right now the legacy users live in a 1559 environment, so it\u2019s not a true comparison between the current paradigm and a 1559 future (but that wasn\u2019t necessarily the point of the notebook, I was more interested in this effect of blending legacy and 1559 users in this new 1559 paradigm).     mdalembert:  compare the results based on some more or less objective cost/benefit metric   The metrics are hard but it\u2019s also hard because there are a lot of factors to control for between the 1559 environment and the legacy environment. Answering \u201cwould I be better off in that scenario vs the other one\u201d is probably possible in aggregate (like how I check the difference between expected and realised types of users included in blocks), but not individually (like \u201cis user X better off bidding that way in legacy or the same way in 1559\u201d). There is likely still interesting things to dig through.     mdalembert:  In particular I have a hunch that even a slight increase in the block gas limits would yield a greater improvement in average gas costs than this proposal, and a reduction in confirmation times that could get close to what this proposal achieves for most users thanks to the increased network throughput, simultaneously improving both metrics I was discussing above instead of trading one for the other.   Right, but this seems orthogonal to 1559. We assume block gas limits are constraints (weak ones, since miners can tune them up or down) and do our best to have a predictable fee market in these constraints. Maybe you are asking what is the net effect of having 1559 (with or without the banking/redistribution) and moving gas limits. One effect might have to do with the dynamic behaviour of basefee and its update rule. Taking the \u201ccontrol theory\u201d view, having flexibility over the block gas limit gives an extra parameter to tune should basefee be oscillating for instance.     mdalembert:  In order to obtain a fair comparison of this proposal vs. the status quo it seems necessary to model some of the mempool dependency of the current oracles at the very least   Agreed! In this notebook I was more interested to extract the \u201cstylised fact\u201d than faithful reproduction, I didn\u2019t want (nor do I think it is possible) to say \u201c1559 will decrease stickiness by 37%!\u201d, but finding that tradeoff between average gas prices and stickiness (which you could get by taking reference from mempool for the oracles) sounds very possible (or at least isolate the factors are play)     mdalembert:  Another interesting experiment to try out (roughly converse to your modelling of legacy users in an EIP-1559 network) would be to model the present protocol in combination with a less sticky gas oracle consisting of an off-chain implementation of the base fee   Intuitively I want to believe that it\u2019s not possible to will a basefee into existence without some sort of binding constraint. The fee burn ensures it is not open to manipulation for instance. I see how you could construct basefee from mempool data (basically you\u2019d get a noisy estimation of the demand curve at T so you could infer the \u201cmarket price\u201d from it) but couldn\u2019t it be easily gamed then? I don\u2019t have an attack in mind but it feels like you are getting too much for free! Interesting\u2026     mdalembert:  (Assuming that it is the result of some sort of quantitative analysis)   We\u2019d have to dig the historical records but my intuition is that the 1/8 value of the update rate parameter was chosen with respect to how long it takes for basefee to 2x or 3x (I know it\u2019s sort of tautological\u2026) But no one believes it is the \u201ccorrect\u201d parameter, or even the correct update rule. Roughgarden formalised the space of possible update rules and there are many variations to consider. One could even have some sort of control on the update rate itself (~gain scheduling). Empirical data would be useful to justify anything, so the plan seems rather to launch as is and decide on updates down the lane. Upstream we\u2019ll be doing some theoretical work on how to think about these tradeoffs, so that it will be more of a \u201cfit the data\u201d problem hopefully. ",

If you dislike looking at the trade-off I was referring to as one between your ability to mitigate the variability of transaction fees and the usability benefit you\u2019ve been arguing for (of being able to bid for your marginal utility), you can look at it roughly equivalently as a trade-off between reducing transaction delays (which according to @timbeiko\u2019s \u201cWhy 1559?\u201d seems to be an explicit goal) and the same usability benefit you were talking about: If the base fee averaging is so fast that it can go through the roof from one block to the next you\u2019ve lost most of the promised elasticity benefit of double-size blocks: users may end up waiting unpredictable amounts of time even though they had set a cap that seemed just fine based on the demand they had just observed, or they may end up hugely overpaying if they had dared to set the cap according to their true marginal utility\u2026 ",

Right?  You will have made the network accessible to even more users.  Resulting fees will still be lower (or equivalently since that\u2019s what you seem to care about the most: delays will still be lower at a given price point) since otherwise those new low-marginal-utility users you have attracted won\u2019t have any reason to stick around.     MicahZoltu:  Also, block size increases come with the rather large problem of state growth, which is a major problem with Ethereum right now. It could very easily be argued that a block size decrease would probably make sense for the long term health of Ethereum.   I agree that the cost of state growth is a serious problem that affects most blockchain networks currently in production, but like any cost it can be quantified and folded into the equation I was referring to as \u201cwhatever usability metric you do care about here\u201d.  The experiment still makes sense if we consider that additional term, right? Vitalik\u2019s article \u201cBlockchain Resource Pricing\u201d has some interesting discussion about the marginal social cost to the network as a function of the block size, and apparently he concludes that the curve is relatively flat in a neighborhood of the block size values commonly used today. Ironically this assumption lies at the very core of EIP-1559: At the promise that it will achieve better economic efficiency, and within the assumption that it\u2019s acceptable to double the allowed block size overnight (the indirect market incentive introduced to try to keep that from happening is no guarantee that there won\u2019t be substantial state growth \u2013 But maybe that\u2019s okay for the time being until Ethereum 2 is fully functional). So as far as I can tell if you turn out to be right and even a small increase in block size leads to an unmanageable explosion of social cost, this proposal is inevitably flawed, too.     MicahZoltu:  There certainly may be room for improvement, but I don\u2019t believe the problem is fully solvable just via better oracles as even the best theoretic oracle we could build today would not be perfect due to the number of inputs into the system (all human users of the system at every moment in time).   I agree that this is a really hard problem, but my intuition also tells me that if you have been able to construct a more efficient gas price estimator on-chain one should also be able to replicate that estimator off-chain with at least similar properties. Why not try to verify that experimentally? ",

Its purpose is not to lower gas prices for anyone, nor to speed up transaction inclusion at a given price point.  Its purpose is to make it so a user can reliably (within some bounds) get a transaction included, and remove the need for users to participate in a first price auction (which is a notoriously difficult auction type to be good at).     mdalembert:  those new low-marginal-utility users you have attracted won\u2019t have any reason to stick around.

Why not try to verify that experimentally?   Many people, including myself, have tried to solve this problem.  If you have a better solution than what is out there I strongly recommend either building a tool that utilizes your solution, or proposing the solution to the community (e.g., on ethresear.ch).  All of the block price estimation tools out there are experimental attempts to address the gas price estimation issues, and they all fail in one way or another so far. ",

Its purpose is not to lower gas prices for anyone, nor to speed up transaction inclusion at a given price point. Its purpose is to make it so a user can reliably (within some bounds) get a transaction included, and remove the need for users to participate in a first price auction (which is a notoriously difficult auction type to be good at). We aren\u2019t trying to attract low marginal utility users with EIP-1559. We are trying to attract users who care about simplicity and usability. Removing the first price auction mechanism allows users with high marginal utility for block space who care a lot about simplicity and usability to utilize the platform.   I wasn\u2019t trying to change your mind about the purpose of EIP-1559, nor convince you to attract low marginal utility users except possibly as a side effect, I was just trying to show the contradiction in your argument that increasing supply by a finite amount is useless \u2013 It will still have a lasting impact on how reliably users can get transactions included (hopefully I got right what you want this time) at any given price point, which might be comparable to the benefit obtained by this proposal according to the same metric.  And if it is, isn\u2019t it worth considering that alternative seriously given that it\u2019s a massively simpler proposal which will also incidentally benefit low-marginal-utility users?

That is to say, in my opinion the block size is already way too high at the moment, and there is no room (in fact negative room) for additional increases to block size.   Reducing block sizes would hurt a lot of users.  If the necessity to reduce block sizes is as urgent as to justify such a compromise then the worst thing that could possibly happen now is a proposal lifting the block limits to 2x the current values\u2026     MicahZoltu:  Every analysis I have seen and done indicates that state growth (over sufficient time periods for averages to work out) does not change with EIP-1559. If you believe there is a flaw in the logic that leads to this conclusion I would definitely like to hear it. So far I haven\u2019t heard any complete/sound arguments that state growth will increase overall with the introduction of EIP-1559.   I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fail-proof, like most market incentives trying to steer people away from doing bad things.  I can think of several potential externalities completely out of our control that could lead to violent price movements (not necessarily of ETH/USD itself but even of other assets relative to ETH) which could disturb that feed-back loop by shifting the equilibrium base fee by orders of magnitude. E.g consider what could happen if you do declare a nuclear war (  ) on the miners and they truly form a cartel and retaliate by taking advantage of their majority hashpower in order to do something really bad, causing the price of ETH to plummet due to the markets losing confidence in it.  This would momentarily make the base fee really cheap in absolute terms and give people a strong incentive to sell off, suddenly making most blocks double-full and further decreasing the value of the currency, possibly to the extent that the price drop neutralizes the effect of the hard-coded base fee increase, allowing people to continue filling up blocks to 200% for an extended amount of time.  At the end of this downwards spiral a new equilibrium price may be reached, at which point blocks will return to 100% full, but there is no guarantee that it will be followed by a period of <100% full blocks, since there is no guarantee that neither the base fee nor the currency it\u2019s denominated in will ever retrace their way back to their original values, leading to a net state growth larger than the present one. And no this doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m pessimistic nor \u201cbearish\u201d on Ethereum, I\u2019m just trying to understand how this market feed-back mechanism would behave under large unexpected price movements (call it a form of risk management). Incidentally state growth isn\u2019t the only reason why I think that the steep dependency you are depicting between block size and social cost would imply a serious flaw in this proposal: As you can see from page 19 of Vitalik\u2019s \u201cBlockchain Resource Pricing\u201d, the key requirement for the present proposal delivering an economic efficiency improvement is C\u2019\u2019 < D\u2019\u2019 (or the absolute value of the slope of the marginal social cost being strictly lower than that of the demand function).  If you\u2019re right and there is a catastrophic increase in social cost anywhere close to the current block size value then we are way better off setting a hard cap at whatever level of supply we can consider sustainable, rather than relying on market feed-back mechanisms to regulate it.

                    "content": "    mdalembert:  It will still have a lasting impact on how reliably users can get transactions included   If there currently exists 100M gas worth of demand for Ethereum block space with a marginal utility that is over the opportunity cost to miners for inclusion, then any increase in supply short of around 100M will result in no meaningful usability improvements.  As you approach 100M you may get to a place where seasonal demand changes allow for some users to experience under full blocks, but during peak season you still have perpetually full blocks and thus you have the exact same problem.  Adjusting the supply below the demand threshold (less than 100M in the above example) does effect gas prices, but that isn\u2019t what we are trying to solve. Also, we have hopes that Ethereum will continue to increase demand, which means that even if we increase the supply enough to satisfy demand today via block size increases, it will just be back to the same problem tomorrow.  That is to say, minor tweaking of block size isn\u2019t a long term viable solution here.  We need real scalability solutions (like rollups and sharding) to solve the supply problem as they give us orders of magnitude increases rather than linear increases, and with very different cost profiles than block size increases.     mdalembert:  lifting the block limits to 2x the current values   EIP-1559 does not increase the average block size by 2x.  It remains flat.  See https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip_1559_spikes for why that is what matters, not transient block sizes.  You are correct that if there is a base_fee increase that doesn\u2019t come back down then over some window of measurement then there will be a net increase in block size.  Similarly, if there is a net base_fee decrease, we\u2019ll see an average block size decrease over a time window that includes that net decrease.  To put it another way, while the base fee is increasing, average block size will increase.  While the base fee is decreasing, average block size will decrease. Given a particular time window, we know that if the base fee is higher at the end than the start, then we ended up with the average block size being over target.  If the base fee is lower at the end than the start, then we ended up with the average block size being under target.  The amount the base fee changed, and perhaps the speed it changed (I am not sure if speed of change matters here, but would be interesting to find out) will determine how much over or under we are for that time window.  This is generally considered acceptable because the chain growth is quite well bounded. You do bring up a good point though that the base fee is denominated in ETH, while the marginal utility of inclusion may not be denominated in ETH for users.  This means that the price of ETH relative to whatever user marginal utility is denominated may decline steadily over time which would result in the base fee steadily increasing over time.  In such a world, any given time window selected would result in a higher base fee at the end compared to the beginning, which means there would be an average increase in block space utilization. This is certainly an interesting facet that I hadn\u2019t previously considered.  I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m terribly worried about it, but it is definitely worth thinking about further. ",

                    "content": "    MicahZoltu:  then any increase in supply short of around 100M will result in no meaningful usability improvements.   In order to try to resolve this disagreement let\u2019s try to define more precisely what we mean by a usability improvement: Does it mean, for instance, increasing the amount of transactions sent per individual in a given population that make it into the blockchain within a \u201creasonable\u201d timeframe of, say, 5min?  (If you\u2019re still not satisfied by the metric I\u2019m trying to optimize feel free to suggest a different one which can be expressed quantitatively) If that\u2019s the case then increasing the gas limit by a small factor can be expected to decrease the minimum gas price of each block by a similar factor (which is related to the former by the price elasticity of demand), allowing it to fall below the marginal utility threshold of more users that are now able to ensure immediate inclusion of their transaction into the next block, thereby improving the usability metric I was referring to above.     MicahZoltu:  Also, we have hopes that Ethereum will continue to increase demand, which means that even if we increase the supply enough to satisfy demand today via block size increases, it will just be back to the same problem tomorrow.   Under increasing demand the usability metric above is expected to decrease steadily due to the increasing denominator with a roughly fixed numerator, but at any given point in time usability will be greater than it would be for the same demand if the change was reverted, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re \u201cback to the same problem\u201d.  Incidentally, the same thing can be said about this proposal: Usability will increase by a finite amount initially, and then steadily decrease from that point on for the exact same reason.  Which of the two will give a greater usability improvement? It\u2019s hard to say a priori, which is why it would be interesting to address the matter quantitatively: If a substantially simpler change is able to provide a greater benefit at a comparable cost you\u2019ll have a clear sign that something is wrong and the proposal needs to be corrected (or fully replaced with the simpler alternative).     MicahZoltu:  EIP-1559 does not increase the average block size by 2x. It remains flat.   Yes, only the hard block limit is increased by 2x.  Regarding the average block size, it\u2019s not at all clear that with this proposal it will remain the same as today in the long run.  If the price of ETH has a certain momentum, it wouldn\u2019t be unexpected for the base fee to develop a similar but opposite momentum (since their product is tied to the marginal utility users extract out of the network, pretty much as you point out in your last comment), which would allow blocks to remain systematically above or below 100%.  The resulting average block size may substantially deviate from the present one, and it\u2019s hard to say in which direction it might go and how much without being able to predict the future pricing of ETH, so this proposal requires us to have some tolerance to the average block size deviating from the expected result, which is why it seems natural to me to compare its \u201cusability\u201d performance with the much simpler alternative that increases the block size by a small factor (Under the assumption that such deviations from the current block size will be small which is by no means guaranteed, the worst-case behavior of this proposal is only bounded by the 2x hard limit).

IMO, if EIP-1559 is for fixing UX problems, which means providing reliable information about tx inclusion cost to users so that they can skip guess tx cost, it is trying to address a question cannot be addressed at protocol level. Whenever user try to send a on-chain tx, their payment to miners have to cover miners\u2019 marginal cost for producing that gas otherwise it cannot go into blocks. But the protocol cannot know miners\u2019 marginal cost, so it can not provide enough information to improve UX. Base fee can not tell you how much tips you need to pay. An important arguement from pro is that when block is not full (which is attributed to self-adjusting base fee), users whoever willing to pay base fee and a small amout tips can be included due to profit-maximized strategies excuted by miners. It is true only if we assume miners\u2019 marginal cost of gas production is zero, or a well-known constant value (which is obviously unrealistic) . Miners\u2019 marginal cost must be incremental with the amout of gas already provided. Once again, the marginal cost is a private information cann\u2019t be determined unless they make it public by themseves, no matter whether block is full or not. ",

It is important to have a critical look at 1559 and not take its arguments wholesale, but there are also several issues with what you wrote. If you are willing to provide key reasoning, it would help to be more precise in the arguments you share. It is not always clear how you arrive at some of your conclusions and you seem to focus on a static analysis when 1559 is inherently a dynamic process. You are right that the fee market is mostly out-of-equilibrium (by equilibrium I mean at a price where supply = demand), like all markets generally are. In some cases, users will overpay, when demand is lower than the current basefee quotes for instance. This is not an argument against 1559 however. This is a general property of \u201ct\u00e2tonnement\u201d mechanisms which dynamically discover prices. The point of 1559 is not to eliminate entirely the possibility that users might overpay since it is impossible unless you have perfect information on the demand curve at every point in time (which is impossible for multiple reasons). The point of 1559 however is to drastically reduce imprecision over the current equilibrium price, which is naturally changing as demand also changes. If you are intent on using this argument as a flaw of 1559, you must be able to show why you think this is worse under 1559 than under the current system.     editor-Ajian:  Miners\u2019 marginal cost must be incremental with the amout of gas already provided.   It\u2019s also not clear how you understand the tip. Are you saying in the quote above that marginal cost is an increasing function of the amount of gas in the block? Miners may have private information regarding their willingness to include transactions that pay them below a certain amount of tip in 1559, but this is fine. If users are consistently rejected by miners because their tips are too low, they will increase the tips. If some miners reject tips above their marginal costs, any miner can deviate and take these rejected transactions for themselves, this is the argument behind showing that miner collusion (for instance, one that would never include transactions with tips below some level higher than the marginal cost) is unstable and implies a 51% attack for the collusion to truly work. Tips should equilibrate to whatever miners are willing to accept in an efficient market. You could argue that the market is not fully efficient as users usually go through wallets to make their transactions, so the wallet tip defaults is actually what matters. This would likely mean that should a wallet undershoot the marginal cost of the miner, its users would not be included, after which it would review the tip upwards. This is a slower adjustment process than the one I described before, but there is no reason to think the marginal cost to miners changes more rapidly than this, since it depends solely on client implementations. In other words, I do not see an argument why users or wallets shouldn\u2019t be able to find a tip level that satisfies miner preferences. ",

Yes, I agree with you that both 1559 and current mechanism cannot do that, and that is exactly what I want to say. But my questions remain: Where is the improvement? Or now you agree with that it is just as good as current mechanism in the terms of gas predictability?     barnabe:  Are you saying in the quote above that marginal cost is an increasing function of the amount of gas in the block?   Sorry, My English writting is not well [Cry]. Thanks for your patience. I mean, the supply curve have a positive slope. (For example, when they are providing 500th unit of gas, the cost is 100 gwei, but when are providing 1000th unit of gas, the cost is 400 gwei: marginal cost of gas will increase with the amount of gas that they decided to provide in a certain time window.     barnabe:  If users are consistently rejected by miners because their tips are too low, they will increase the tips   So what is the difference between a post-eip-1559 world with current world?     barnabe:  If some miners reject tips above their marginal costs, any miner can deviate and take these rejected transactions for themselves, this is the argument behind showing that miner collusion (for instance, one that would never include transactions with tips below some level higher than the marginal cost) is unstable and implies a 51% attack for the collusion to truly work.   Ehh, I guess you mistake what I said. Manipulation or collusion is irrelevant, I never see any importance to discuss such behaviors in this topic (because I believe that there would not esixt collusion or manipulation). No one has more confidence in market competition than me. As you mention above, fee mechanism is just a context, in which market competition works to find out prices (cost). I am no saying that EIP-1559 will stuck market functions to find out miners\u2019 marginal cost. I am saying that because protocol cannot find out the marginal cost (no matter we choose which mechanism), so EIP-1559 cannot provide improvement. It is at best as good as current mechanism, if not worse (think about the cases when demamd drops but base fee is still high). Maybe you think that, it is as good as current mechanims, so it is no a flaw. But IMO, when we propose a change, we have to prove that there is some improvement worth the risk, right? ",

                    "content": "Thanks for your reply!     editor-Ajian:  Sorry, My English writting is not well [Cry]. Thanks for your patience   No worries, and also want to point out that this is not what hampered my understanding of your post. English isn\u2019t my native tongue either so I can appreciate the difficulty. For instance on your plots in the post I couldn\u2019t always distinguish the areas you refer to, though I could reconstruct the argument. The clarity I was seeking had more to do with arguing for your interpretation of 1559 as a tax and why you think the tip would not equilibrate.     editor-Ajian:  But my questions remain: Where is the improvement? Or now you agree with that it is just as good as current mechanism in the terms of gas predictability?   Ok, so if you argue as you do in the post that  When demand increase rapidly, as EIP-1559 allow miners to produce 2x bigger block (\u2018slack mechanism\u2019), consumers can get more benefits. But when demand decrease and base fee is still greater than zero, consumers have to pay more costs which is higher than current mechanism level.  then I disagree (or at least, I expect a reason why the change would be worse than the current mechanism, by some definition of worse you should provide). If you argue that since we are keen to change the mechanism, then the burden of proof is on us to show that it does improve things, I think it\u2019s fair, but it\u2019s significantly different from your first assertion. On this point the discussion with @mdalembert has more to do with how do we quantify these improvements (still thinking about some of the points raised). You mention predictability, so I want to try and define what is meant by that. Predictability could mean that given the quoted price you observe (basefee + equilibrium tip), you can expect fast inclusion (typically next block). It does not mean that we know for sure what the gas price is ten or hundred blocks from now (I don\u2019t think this is what you were arguing). Predictability fails in at least one case: whenever basefee is \u201cexcessively low\u201d (taking Roughgarden\u2019s definition here), there isn\u2019t enough room to fit all the effective demand (effective = consumers with transaction values above the basefee + tip) in the next block. This is a case that your analysis could distinguish more finely: there is a difference between \u201cdemand increases and so does basefee\u201d and \u201cdemand increases beyond what the next block can accommodate and so does basefee, which is excessively low beforehand\u201d. In the first case, there is no reason to think that tips would deviate from the marginal cost level: there is room for everyone, even though the block is filled beyond target (but not beyond limit!) In the second case, there is a legitimate argument to be made that we should see tips engage in a transient bidding war, until basefee catches up again. This is btw what one of my notebooks reproduces: when basefee is excessively low, users do have a strategic incentive to bid beyond the marginal cost tip to get in quicker. We can again differentiate two cases: Either the user does care about inclusion time, in which case it would bid to get in first, or the user doesn\u2019t care at all and just wants inclusion. In the second case, the only reason for a user to overbid is to guarantee that they would get in before basefee reaches their maximum willingness to pay (encoded in 1559 transactions as the fee cap). With that out of the way, the question should be \u201chow often are we in the first case (effective demand increases, but the next block can accommodate everyone) vs the second case (effective demand rises faster and the next block is too small to accommodate everyone)?\u201d If we are always in the second case, there is a point to be made that we are only reproducing the current model. I don\u2019t have quantified arguments on this, but I don\u2019t even think this is true. Basefee in that case is still a somewhat objective (laggy, sure) oracle of the current market price, and users who have low time preferences but high value for inclusion can \u201cride out\u201d the market more easily than they could in the current model. The expectation is that we are not that often in the second case (Hasu and Georgios wrote it as \u201cthe 95% vs the 5% cases\u201d, though these are not numbers obtained from empirical analysis). This is supported by looking at historical demand volatility and the fact that the basefee updates are governed by a parameter providing some control over how fast it catches up. There are questions on how the parameter should be set (I discussed some above) and they are legitimate, but at the time there are more reasons than not to think that basefee should adequately put us in the first situation (basefee is not excessively low, next-block inclusion can be guaranteed) most of the time. If you agree that 1559 provides substantial benefits in that case, then you should agree that it improves on the current paradigm. Some stray points to conclude:   Even excessively low basefees are not unmanageable. There is an argument that we can even reuse current gas price oracles to help in this case, when users have a strategic incentive to overbid. For instance, a wallet detects that basefee is shifting upwards quickly, and switches to \u201cexpert mode\u201d to propose to the user three defaults based on oracles for how competitive the bid should be.   Related: None of the above mentions how much simpler the bidding strategies are for users, including for wallets who provide fee estimation. Since this is more intangible, I believe @MicahZoltu 's post \u201cA tale of two pricing schemes\u201d (sorry Micah! i can\u2019t link it, I have too many links in my post already apparently, but it\u2019s easy to find) is the best way to frame it.        editor-Ajian:  I mean, the supply curve have a positive slope. (For example, when they are providing 500th unit of gas, the cost is 100 gwei, but when are providing 1000th unit of gas, the cost is 400 gwei: marginal cost of gas will increase with the amount of gas that they decided to provide in a certain time window.   Ok, so I understand this as more than the supply curve has positive slope: you also mean that the first derivative of the curve is positive too (marginal cost increases with supply). I think this was quantified before, iirc you\u2019re right that the supply curve is not completely linear (linear: same cost to go from 1M to 1.1M gas block than 10M to 10.1M gas block), but it\u2019s also not far from it. Which supports an argument that users/wallets and miners would probably converge to some imprecise upper bound of the marginal cost per gas unit. Sure we could make models and estimate to the n-th decimal for what it is, but my hunch is we\u2019ll all agree on a round number because Schelling. ",

Maybe we could have some shorter but more precise communicaion to make sure our opinions, to save our time and keep going. IMO, effects brought by EIP-1559 can be classified into three category: UX, (equilbrium) tx cost and security. And the main purpose of our reasoning is to compare the EIP-1559 and current mechanism in these three dimension, to figure out where is improvement. When it comes to equilbrium tx cost and security, we can use supply curve, demamd curve, consumers\u2019 surplus and providers\u2019 surplus to analyse the performance of current mechanism and EIP-1559 as a mechanism. Use these concept, you can see how much users get (or lost) and how much miners get(or lost) in different market conditions. (Yes, it is static analysis as it do not use simulation to observe dynamic processes. But it is completed as the analysis covers every cases need to be discussed.) But when it comes to UX problems, mainly \u2018the predictability of tx cost\u2019, concepts I mentioned above cannot help. (I never argue that tips cannot equilibrate, no no no, we can just assume that both of gas prices and tips can equilibrate, or nether of them can equilibrate. Otherwise it is unfair.

My difinition of \u2018predictability\u2019 is that for those who just persuit inclusion for next block, don\u2019t care about the rank in the block (which means a normal user, not a geek defi user, the same as your opinion), the minimum tx cost is as accurate as possible. EIP-1559 can not help, just like current mechanism can not help (can not provide these information, and I know you get it). UX improvement is the main arguement of pros of EIP-1559.

The crux of it is that you can overbid without overpaying.  First price auctions are incredibly hard for humans, especially in a chaotic bidding environment.  1559 allows users to effectively participate in form of uniform price multiunit auctions for block space, which enables them to bid their marginal utility (or at least much closer to it) without having to pay their maximum bid every time.

You just say that it can do this, it can do that, but you do not explain how and why. For example, you said that EIP-1599 can help users \u2018avoid overpaying\u2019, but how? If we read carefully, we can find two key information:  You introduce an additional field for tx called \u2018Fee cap\u2019, which difines the maximun protocols and miners can extract from this user; at the same time, user still need to set \u2018tip\u2019 manually (to incentive miner).  After setting, when \u2018base fee + tip\u2019 < \u2018fee cap\u2019, the tx is minable; and when it go into blocks, user can get \u2018fee cap - base fee - tip\u2019 back. (Is it a correct understand?)  You can say that it can avoid overpaying as users can set the maximum value they are willing to pay as \u2018fee cap\u2019, so actual payment can not beyond their willing. But in current mechanism, no one will set a gas price higher than the maximun value thery are willing to pay. At the same time, the possibility of overpaying still remains as user still need to guess tip level, just like in current mechanims that they need to guess gas price level. Willing to pay base fee can not guarantee that the tx will be included. It is possible that a user set a sufficient fee cap, but can not be included as the tip he set is too low. ",

As it is not full, due to profit-maximized strategies excuted by miners, they will include any tx willing to pay base fee and a positive tip (no matter how low is it). So every tx willing to pay base fee can be included. (Is is a corrent understand to your arguement\uff1f)  This arguement is much important than the 1\uff09. But it is still wrong. As a profit-maximized strategy require a miner just include those txs whose tip can cover his/her marginal cost of gas production, rather than include any txs with a positive tip. And, marginal cost of gas production is a dynamic value. Theoretically, it will increase with the amount of gas the miner decided to provide at that time. (e.g. When he/she provide the 500th gas, the marginal cost is 30gwei, but when he/she provide the 1000th gas, the marginal cost must be higher than 30gwei). If wo do not hold the assumption that the marginal cost of gas production is a fixed value, base fee can not tell us any useful information to help users avoid overpaying.

Each block has a base_fee that applies to all transactions in a block and is extremely expensive to manipulate (unless executing a censorship attack). A transaction will cost between base_fee and inclusion_fee + base_fee.  A user can set the max_fee to be 1 ETH per gas, and they\u2019ll still always only pay between base_fee and inclusion_fee + base_fee. In a transaction today there is only the gas_price.  A user will always pay gas_price, even if they set it way too high, like to 1 ETH per gas. The big difference here is that under EIP-1559, a user can set max_fee to be their marginal utility for inclusion.  If congestion increases between the time of clicking the button and the time their transaction is mined, the cost of inclusion may increase but as long as it is still under their marginal utility (max_fee) they\u2019ll be included. Under the current system, users are strongly incentivized to bid what they believe the market rate is.  Since the market rate for gas is incredibly volatile, this means that users often fail to be included.  The way for users to combat this failure today is to over pay for transactions by setting the gas_price to a value that is substantially higher than the market rate.  I believe all major clients are being programmed to allow the miner to configure a minimum_inclusion_fee which will be constant for that miner.  From a mechanism design/game theory standpoint, the opportunity cost of inclusion is effectively linear, which means there is no rational reason to have any kind of dynamic minimum_inclusion_fee.  A miner could write a custom client that has some kind of variable/dynamic minimum_inclusion_fee, but the only real reason to do that that I can think of would be to be a dick. It is also rational for miners to set the minimum_inclusion_fee to just above opportunity cost of inclusion.  The last estimates for this were around 1 nanoeth (gwei) per gas, though I suspect it is lower now. This means that it is strongly expected that the minimum_inclusion_fee distribution across miners will become known pretty quickly, and it is expected to hover around the 1 nanoeth range.  Some miners may set it to 2, and some may set it to 0.5, but it would be mildly surprising to see any miners set it to 100 (this would not be a profitable strategy) and it would be even more surprising to see any miners set it dynamically (this would not be a profitable strategy).  Those two things combine to mean that we should see a quite stable minimum_inclusion_fee across most miners (meaning, most blocks will have a fairly predictable minimum_inclusion_fee) and users can bid their marginal utility on max_fee without fear of overpaying by more than ~1 or 2 nanoeth per gas.

As it is not full, due to profit-maximized strategies excuted by miners, they will include any tx willing to pay base fee and a positive tip (no matter how low is it). So every tx willing to pay base fee can be included. (Is is a corrent understand to your arguement\uff1f)   This is incorrect.  Profit seeking miners not executing a censorship attack against the network should include all transactions where: max_fee > base_fee + minimum_inclusion_fee && inclusion_fee > minimum_inclusion_fee minimum_inclusion_fee should be set by profit motivated miners to just over opportunity cost of inclusion (expected to be around 1 nanoeth).     editor-Ajian:  And, marginal cost of gas production is a dynamic value. Theoretically, it will increase with the amount of gas the miner decided to provide at that time. (e.g. When he/she provide the 500th gas, the marginal cost is 30gwei, but when he/she provide the 1000th gas, the marginal cost must be higher than 30gwei).   This is also incorrect.  Marginal cost of inclusion is approximately linear with gas used.  In fact, a major aspect of gas pricing is trying to ensure this is true. ",

                    "content": "I find @editor-Ajian 's blog post does a pretty good job at showing that essentially the same market forces are going to be driving gas prices around equilibrium, it was badly needed given the amount of misinformation there is falsely claiming that this proposal is going to reduce gas prices (Thank you for it!).  That said I also think that @barnabe and @MicahZoltu have a point showing that the auction mechanism proposed in this EIP has certain theoretical advantages in its dynamic behavior away from equilibrium. For instance, I agree with @barnabe that the proposed auction mechanism is likely to reduce the pricing imprecision of the current mechanism, and I agree that the base fee can be made to track some stable and more or less objective market price predictably enough (which is critical to keep users from overpaying under significant block-to-block demand volatility), with the caveat I already hinted at that both of these benefits are to some extent mutually exclusive (best stability requires BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR to approach infinity which causes the pricing mechanism to revert back to a first-price auction negating the pricing precision benefit, and vice versa, best pricing precision requires BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR to approach zero which can lead to high base fee volatility exposing users to overpaying more than they do today), so the practical realization of this proposal is necessarily going to have to make some sort of compromise between the benefits it promises to deliver, which is why I\u2019ve been such a PITA trying to agree on some precise enough definition of what we mean by \u201cimproving usability\u201d, since only that way can we answer the question of whether this proposal is going to be cost-effective to the community by some quantitative metric (even while compared with the simplest alternative imaginable of slightly increasing gas limits which incidentally would have advantages near equilibrium that this proposal lacks). I think that expressing the intended benefits of this proposal in some objective scale is made all the more urgent due to the intertwining of the intended usability improvements with a monetary policy change. Any monetary policy amounts to a redistribution of value from one sector of the community (e.g. whoever is burning their ETH) to another one (e.g. whoever is holding significant amounts of ETH), so I don\u2019t think that @editor-Ajian 's depiction of the base fee as a tax is particularly far-fetched.  I believe that the fact that these two changes are being proposed as a single EIP (IMHO without a technical necessity to do so) has greatly contributed to polarization and hampered consensus so far, because it\u2019s extremely difficult for people to judge a proposal based on its actual merits and risks to the greater community whenever they have something to personally win or lose out of it, even if they\u2019re doing it with their best intentions to contribute something positive to the community. So I suspect that a roughly orthogonal route to get this proposal to gain more traction would be to separate those two aspects into two different proposals (E.g. by implementing the proposal of rolling-average banking and redistribution of the base fee suggested by Tim Roughgarden, which would incidentally also address the incompatibility between this EIP and a fixed-supply monetary policy). At the very least that would fully dissipate the perception of a conflict of interests behind any argument for or against the fee structure reform being discussed here. ",

                    "content": "    editor-Ajian:  Yes, it is static analysis as it do not use simulation to observe dynamic processes. But it is completed as the analysis covers every cases need to be discussed.   As I see it, there are three salient cases that entirely cover the space of transitions from one basefee to the next:  Current effective demand is higher than target, but lower than block limit. Current effective demand is higher than target and higher than block limit. Current effective demand is lower than target.  (maybe Case 4: effective demand is equal to target is simple enough) In cases 1. and 2., basefee increases. In cases 1. and 3., users can bid the marginal cost (or some upper bound) and receive immediate inclusion. In case 2., users have a temporary incentive to deviate from the marginal cost tip, and possibly to bid against each other. The cases where basefee is 0 doesn\u2019t seem relevant, but making the distinction between 1. and 2. is important to see the tip dynamics.      editor-Ajian:  If wo do not hold the assumption that the marginal cost of gas production is a fixed value, base fee can not tell us any useful information to help users avoid overpaying. They still need to guess, just like in current mechanism   There still appears to be a fundamental misunderstanding here, so I\u2019ll try and formalise the argument. I am a miner and it is my turn to mine a block. I have a cost for supplying the block and gas, which we\u2019ll call f(S), where S is the amount of gas supplied in the block. What is that cost? The most important part is the risk of my block becoming an uncle. The larger the block is, the slower the propagation, the higher the risk. f(0) = b, where b is some constant, meaning that if I mine an empty block (no transactions), I still have to send around a few bytes, so the risk of being uncled is non-zero. If there are increasing marginal costs, say, linear in the gas already supplied, then f(S) = b + a * S2, where a is some coefficient. Here is how I understand your argument: a user doesn\u2019t know where on that supply curve their transaction falls. The transaction may be included after the miner supplied S1 gas in the block, or after S2, S1 < S2. The marginal cost to the miner for including the transaction is respectively 2aS1 and 2aS2, with 2aS1 < 2aS2. If the user sets their tip to 2aS2 but are included at S1, then they are overpaying: the miner would have been satisfied by 2aS1, since it is their marginal cost. Do you agree that setting your tip to 2aG, where G is the maximum supply of gas a miner can provide in a block, guarantees that you always satisfy the miner marginal cost? Now, you have not provided evidence why the marginal costs would be increasing (please do if you have it!), but there are reasons to believe that 1 Gwei is an upper bound of 2aG: whatever the location of your transaction on the supply curve, a 1 Gwei per gas unit tip covers my marginal cost. You could probably make the argument in fact that G (the total tips received by the miner if the block is full and tip = 1 gwei per gas) is greater than b + a * G2 (the total cost to the miner of supplying G gas), which would even cover the fixed cost of sending the block empty (if not for 1 Gwei, then for another value close to that). This value however is residual compared to what users are currently paying in the current system. Users more than cover the marginal cost. The only question is whether they are overpaying compared to some price that would equalise supply and demand in the current market, and the answer is likely that in some cases yes, in others no. How about in 1559? The price a user pays, P, can be decomposed into basefee B plus the tip T (P = B + T). The miner doesn\u2019t receive B (in the vanilla version), but receives T. Should T be set to 1 Gwei (or an upper bound we are both happy with), the marginal cost MC to the miner is always covered. I think you are claiming that there are cases where MC < T, in which case the user is overpaying. Although this is technically correct, there are three things to keep in mind:  The supply curve is probably close to linear: the more linear it is, the less \u201croom\u201d for tips to deviate from some fixed marginal cost. Assuming all users converge on an identical \u201cdefault tip\u201d T Gwei per gas for cases 1. and 3. above, and miners reject any transaction that does not cover at least T, the true overpayment of the user is exactly T - MC, which if point 1 holds, implies T ~ MC. Let\u2019s assume that MC is fixed for now and look at two situations. In the first, T = MC, users pay the exact marginal cost to the miner, basefee moves to make supply = demand, users are priced at P = B + MC. Second situation, assume that for some reason, users and miners have decided that T* = 10 x MC. At P*, supply = demand. Basefee will always naturally converge to the equilibrium point, so that P* = B* + T*. Users burn less (B* < B) and more is given to miners (T* > T). But P* = P. Users are overpaying the tip (T* > MC) but they aren\u2019t overpaying for inclusion. I\u2019ll allow that should the marginal costs be increasing, and not fixed, then there technically is room for overpaying for inclusion too. But I maintain that this effect is negligible (and all the more negligible the more marginal costs are fixed, which I believe is a good approximation unless proven otherwise), and not a flaw of 1559.       editor-Ajian:  But in current mechanism, no one will set a gas price higher than the maximun value thery are willing to pay.   But no one sets their maximum willingness to pay either, this is an important property of pay-as-you-bid mechanisms: they are not incentive compatible.      mdalembert:  with the caveat I already hinted at that both of these benefits are to some extent mutually exclusive   I don\u2019t think mutually exclusive is necessarily the correct description. I agree with the extreme cases you mention (the rate set at infinity or at zero), but there is no evidence that a happy middle doesn\u2019t exist. You\u2019ll probably counter: no evidence that it exists either  afaiac, I don\u2019t think the exact slope of that tradeoff (is it mutually exclusive as you say, or possible to aim for a healthy mix of the two) will be found before deploying. Until then, accumulating evidence that some forces push the tradeoff one way or another. I am enjoying your posts because you provide tangible ways to do so (I like the counterfactual of increasing the block limit for instance), but I don\u2019t have analysis yet (busy writing walls of texts, promise to stop after this one). We should recognise that even then we\u2019ll need to make some assumptions on the demand (how should they react to increased block space vs a change of bidding mechanism?) so an objective measure of how much better/worse things are is probably unattainable. But evidence of what makes some things better/worse, sure. Here is one: This discussion obscures the way 1559 bidding strategy works, which was well described by @MicahZoltu as \u201cpaying the least amount possible at the time of inclusion\u201d. So the \u201cstability\u201d side of the basefee isn\u2019t its more salient component. In case 1. above, we guarantee next-block inclusion at the quoted price. In case 2., we guarantee that your transaction will be considered for inclusion as long as basefee doesn\u2019t top out your max fee (minus the tip). This is more than can be said of the current bidding grammar: you place a single number, and if you are in case 2., since you most likely have not bid your willingness to pay (because who does in this economy??), your chances at inclusion are dimmer than they would be under 1559, unless of course you are nursing your bid, diligently following the latest oracles and replacing as the market moves.      mdalembert:  I don\u2019t think that @editor-Ajian 's depiction of the base fee as a tax is particularly far-fetched   As I understand it, this is not the only way it was described. In the post basefee is also referred to as a consumer tax that arbitrarily adds cost to the item (transaction inclusion), thereby deviating the equilibrium from its natural point. We\u2019ve spoken at length about its dynamics but since its target is the point where supply = demand, I don\u2019t think this interpretation is correct. As a redistributive transfer, sure. ",

Yes, I don\u2019t rule out the existence of a middle point people may consider provides acceptable results, my point is just that such a middle point is necessarily going to have to make a compromise between the key advantages people are using as justification for EIP-1559, so it seems worth checking that the result is going to measure up against the simpler alternatives based on some quantitative model.     barnabe:  I don\u2019t think the exact slope of that tradeoff (is it mutually exclusive as you say, or possible to aim for a healthy mix of the two) will be found before deploying.       barnabe:  We should recognise that even then we\u2019ll need to make some assumptions on the demand (how should they react to increased block space vs a change of bidding mechanism?) so an objective measure of how much better/worse things are is probably unattainable.   I agree that it won\u2019t be possible to fine-tune the trade-off based on simulations alone, but it would be fairly risky to move to production completely blind without at least some preliminary evidence that such a happy point may exist and where it might be.  I think quantitative modeling should at least enable us to come up with upper and lower bounds for the averaging parameter, e.g. by plugging in a wide range of averaging parameters and demand curves and seeing at which point the system starts developing instability \u2013 Indeed it would be intractable to search the space of demand curves exhaustively, but one could expect the damping of any oscillations to be mostly determined by the slope of the demand curve to a first order of approximation, so it would be a good start to use a varied enough set of straight lines as demand curve.     barnabe:  This discussion obscures the way 1559 bidding strategy works, which was well described by @MicahZoltu as \u201cpaying the least amount possible at the time of inclusion\u201d. So the \u201cstability\u201d side of the basefee isn\u2019t its more salient component.   I find on the contrary that the \u201cstability\u201d component is essential for \u201cpaying the least amount possible at the time of inclusion\u201d.  Such an idealized description of the bidding strategy also seems somewhat misleading because the base fee applied to a transaction has nothing to do with the actual demand at the block where the transaction is included, it\u2019s fully determined by the demand during previous blocks, so without a fair stability trade-off the base fee is going to be disproportionately influenced by the demand at the immediately previous block, which is a random variable that might add substantial variance to the price you pay at the time of inclusion.  Furthermore, even if one neglects these random block-to-block fluctuations, this mechanism is essentially going to act as an oscillatory system with an equilibrium point at the target demand, and depending on the marginal demand and price level it might take substantial damping to get the system to converge to any particular value (which you can achieve with a weighting parameter closer to the \u201cstability\u201d end of that trade-off I was discussing).  Instability is your enemy if you\u2019re trying to pay the least amount possible at the time of inclusion (of course unless you\u2019re trying to game the system and take advantage of the oscillations in order to pay a price below the market price, but then you get to give up any usability benefit  ).     barnabe:  As I understand it, this is not the only way it was described.

I think it\u2019s technically possible for the imposition of a base fee to disturb the equilibrium point between supply and demand, particularly under increasing centralization of hashpower.  That said I agree with you that under present conditions it\u2019s unlikely for the base fee to significantly alter the equilibrium point between the supply and demand curve, but only because the hard supply cap causes the supply curve to look pretty close to a vertical line in a neighborhood of the current equilibrium point, so it\u2019s unlikely for a shift up or down to significantly disturb it: However the same can be said about any consumer tax for a good whose supply curve has the same peculiarity, so I don\u2019t think that invalidates @editor-Ajian 's analogy (E.g. compare it with the effect of a government heavily taxing some luxury good with essentially fixed supply, wouldn\u2019t make it less of a tax  ).

So the \u201cstability\u201d side of the basefee isn\u2019t its more salient component.   I find on the contrary that the \u201cstability\u201d component is essential for \u201cpaying the least amount possible at the time of inclusion\u201d. Such an idealized description of the bidding strategy also seems somewhat misleading because the base fee applied to a transaction has nothing to do with the actual demand at the block where the transaction is included, it\u2019s fully determined by the demand during previous blocks, so without a fair stability trade-off the base fee is going to be disproportionately influenced by the demand at the immediately previous block, which is a random variable that might add substantial variance to the price you pay at the time of inclusion.   When I say \u201cleast amount possible\u201d I mean \u201cleast amount possible in the given environment\u201d, not the least amount possible given all possible theoretical environments and frameworks.  A user who bids 1 ETH per gas can be confident that they won\u2019t over pay by a significant amount under EIP-1559 unless an attacker burns far more money attacking the system than the user would lose (economic guarantee). It isn\u2019t about finding the absolute lowest price theoretically possible.  It is about giving the user confidence that they are getting a \u201cgood\u201d deal without them having to put in a huge amount of work/effort.  Yes, they may be able to get a slightly better deal by playing the oscillations, or in a completely different fee system it is possible the fee they would get is lower.  However, in 1559 they will get a \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d deal regardless of their bid, which is where the UX benefit comes from. ",

If that is a correct summary, then my response is that we should not let perfect be the enemy of good.  This is doubly true when in order to achieve perfect we first need to gather data using an imperfect system. ",

There are two things I know are certain, investors and miners both want to be paid. Apart from fan boyism, we are both investors, just coming at it from different angles. Miners provide a service, and investors provide an incentive. While it is completely possible that implementation can happen with both parties being happy, it is not the future I see for EIP-1559. My main argument for this is pure financial incentive. Investors do not want to be separated from their money in the form of fees, while miners want to be compensated for the service they provide. At the end of the day, it is not important what currency either party is involved in, they will gravitate to the currencies that work for their own personal use case. I do not mine Ethereum because it is something that I hold an emotional tie to, I mine because it is profitable to do so with the funds and equipment available to myself. If EIP-1559 is implemented, myself, and likely many other miners will migrate to where the new money is coming in. While I do believe Ethereum has reached a point it is so engrained and invested into it is not going anywhere, it does not mean it is safe from the whim of the people supporting it. If for whatever reason there was indication that Ethereum was not going to grow, or even hold its value investors would be running for the hills. It is the same way with myself, if there was indication that mining Ethereum was no longer profitable, I would switch algorithm to whatever was profitable. While there may be enough diehard Ethereum miners to keep the system going, the network performance and security will be greatly degraded. There are already complaints within the community on the slow performance of the network. With an exodus of miners, there would be even less protection from 51% attacks. For example, a mining pool could decide based on the number of miners leaving the network they would have the hashrate to successfully implement a 51% attack. With current complaints of network speed, and precedent set in Ethereum classic of 51% attacks, I do not feel that EIP-1559 will be good for the Ethereum community. Like so many other things in life people are only happy when money is being spent and people are getting paid. I do feel there is room for a middle ground, it will have to be competitive with the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. ",

In this case, the majority of people I speak with who fully understand how EIP-1559 works see the benefit it provides.  Those that don\u2019t are usually compelled by the illustrative story in https://medium.com/@MicahZoltu/a-tale-of-two-pricing-schemes-dc9c8717906 and other articles. It is still unclear to me why you don\u2019t find these usability improvements compelling while others do, and perhaps it is because you have some information that others don\u2019t or you recognize a fatal flaw that others do not.  However, we have gone back and forth several times and I\u2019m still struggling to see a fatal flaw or new information in your arguments. You have made a compelling point that over any given window of time gas used will be higher if the base fee ends the window higher than it starts the window, and inversely gas used will be lower if the base fee ends the window lower than it starts the window.  This isn\u2019t a point I had previously considered and I do very much appreciate you bringing it to light. You have also made a compelling point that if the price of ETH declines while the marginal demand (denominated in the thing the ETH price is declining relative to) for block space remains stable, then we will see potentially very large windows of time where the base fee ends significantly higher than it started, which given the above would suggest a net increase in gas used! I very much value you bringing up both of these points, and I think they are important to consider when evaluating EIP-1559, and we have discussed them a bit on the Ethereum R&D Discord server since you brought them to light.  However, I do not personally believe that these points are catastrophic enough to cause the perceived benefits of EIP-1559 to no longer be worth the risk.  Increasing the gas limit guarantees a permanent (until the gas price is changed again) increase in the rate of state growth.  Given the points I mentioned above, EIP-1559 introduces the possibility of an increase in the rate of state growth, and that state growth is constrained long term to as long as the price of ETH declines relative to the denominating currency people use for determining marginal utility of transaction inclusion.  Also, if the price ever rebounds, the state growth will \u201cundo\u201d itself. So while both situations have state growth as part of them, the risks of state growth are quite different, which is why I don\u2019t think \u201cjust increase the block size\u201d is comparable.  Also, as I have mentioned before, I don\u2019t think increasing the block size solves the same problem, but we don\u2019t seem to be able to come to agreement on that and I\u2019m not sure how to resolve that at this point.

                    "content": "    MicahZoltu:  In this case, the majority of people I speak with who fully understand how EIP-1559 works see the benefit it provides. Those that don\u2019t are usually compelled by the illustrative story in https://medium.com/@MicahZoltu/a-tale-of-two-pricing-schemes-dc9c8717906 and other articles.   I can see why people find that story compelling, I just doubt that it\u2019s the whole truth, it paints a pretty grim picture of the status quo while failing to acknowledge the potential disadvantages of this proposal to end users.  It\u2019s not surprising that people find it so convincing but that doesn\u2019t look like a material argument to me.     MicahZoltu:  However, we have gone back and forth several times and I\u2019m still struggling to see a fatal flaw or new information in your arguments.   It wasn\u2019t my intention to point out any fatal flaws so far, nor to get people to rule out this proposal as useless without more careful consideration.  The points you are referring to above regarding the connection between major price changes and state growth weren\u2019t intended to show any sort of catastrophic flaw, but simply as an example demonstrating that the effect of this proposal on state growth is far less deterministic than people seem to think. I think the key point I have raised is that there is some potential for this proposal to increase the gas prices that a significant portion of the user base are paying today.  The assumption that this is going to improve usability relies on this mechanism not frequently reverting back to a first-price auction of miner tips (which requires BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR to be low enough), and on the base fee being a stable and accurate approximation of the real market price (which requires BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR to be high enough). Whether that\u2019s going to be the case for any value of BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR to a degree satisfactory to most users is still unknown, and judging from the information we have so far it might very well be that a small increase in the block gas limits delivers a usability improvement superior to this proposal.     MicahZoltu:  Increasing the gas limit guarantees a permanent (until the gas price is changed again) increase in the rate of state growth. Given the points I mentioned above, EIP-1559 introduces the possibility of an increase in the rate of state growth   To me the question is whether having a large confidence interval on the long-term state growth is better or worse than a small confidence interval with some certain but minor state growth.  I\u2019d argue that if the latter can be shown to provide greater benefits to the user base or if (as you were arguing before) exceeding a certain threshold of state growth for an extended period of time were to lead to unmanageable consequences to the network, the solution with the smaller confidence interval should be preferred.     MicahZoltu:  Also, if the price ever rebounds, the state growth will \u201cundo\u201d itself.   That should be approximately the case, but not quite.  The base fee adjustment formula proposed here is not fully path-independent, so there will always be some minor but permanent state growth with this proposal even if the base fee returns to the same level as it was before.  Quantifying it isn\u2019t straightforward without knowing the frequency and amplitude of such price oscillations beforehand, so we are still left with some significant uncertainty in the long-term state growth with this proposal, even under the unlikely assumption that the ETH price will always keep coming back to the initial level.     MicahZoltu:  I don\u2019t think increasing the block size solves the same problem, but we don\u2019t seem to be able to come to agreement on that and I\u2019m not sure how to resolve that at this point.   I think that the root of that disagreement is the lack of an objective, quantifiable definition of \u201cimproving usability\u201d.  So, what is the problem that this proposal is trying to solve, in quantifiable terms? ",

                    "content": "A way that fees can be reduced is restructuring all of EIP 1559, especially having to do with stakers insane profits. 8% returns, this will severely inflate the coin for all users, with exception of stakers. The burn fee is just a gimmick to hide the true inflation due to stakers returns. This EIP does nothing to solve the gas issue, it is just a restructuring of profits from PoW to PoS which should just be held off on till ETH 2.0, The true big push for EIP 1559 is from big money, now that they are staked up they want the miners profits now. I would be interested to see accurate numbers of how inflation from stakers will effect the economy of ETH after 2.0. Will the burn be enough to cover 5% returns? When stakers are maxed at projected 2-3% returns, how will the burn fee actually counter this when stakers are locked in and that ETH is removed from circulation just creating more ETH at the cost of its users. So in theory the fee system turns ETH from a free system (gas fee for transactions) to a pay to use system (gas fee+base fee+burn) which in turn is paid to the stakers. I understand 2.0 is coming and the change from PoW to PoS is happening, just think this EIP1559 is just a cop out to rush more money to stakers from miners under a disguise that its beneficial to the userbase. In regards to the \u201cburn fee\u201d in any implementation is just a scam to profit stakers and hide the inflation they are creating. Stakers should be making no more than the block rewards divided amongst themselves, they want to burn others ETH while giving themselves ~8% as of today. Very hypocritical everyone is against the miners while nothing is being said about the insane profits stakers are making; while at the same time wanting to burn your ETH. Telling the community its good for the system, its only beneficial to stakers. People complaining about gas fees are also not realizing the fees seem higher because its paid in ETH, while ETH makes all time highs of course the price in USD is going to be higher. 100 gwei is 100 gwei no matter if ETH price is $100 or $10,000.

It may not be a type of governance you are familiar with, the one you\u2019d want, or even a type that can be fully grasped in a few sentences (if at all), but that does not mean there is no governance model. I\u2019m also not sure what you mean by \u201caccepted\u201d, do you want everyone to sign a license or something? You also seem to imply that a formalizing a governance model would give a way to resolve conflicts. But I would argue that formalizing a governance model means someone (or some group) would be in charge of formalizing that governance model, which would lead to conflicts like \u201cwho put you in charge?!\u201d (also, hi S.E.C.!). Aside from that, I feel that all that formalizing governance would leave you with is very little gray area / wiggle room in times of conflict, some cemented form of hierarchy, and it inevitably becoming outdated, unfitting or downright hampering. If you want something like on-chain governance, there are other chains out there trying that. If you want to run a company (\u201cwe at SKALE\u201d) relying on license agreements and courts of law to enforce them, you are more than welcome to. I just don\u2019t think we should try to make Ethereum be like that. Vague is good.

                    "content": "I can\u2019t believe nobody is talking about this. The consensus among economist is that low steady inflation is best for a currency. Deflation leads to inefficiencies and increases the chances of a liquidity trap. A boon of cryptocurrencies in general (and arguable the reason of the recent impulse) is that we are independent from the central banks and their bipolar monetary policy of \u201cprint money whenever we feel like it\u201d. With EIP-1559, we go from the current predictable declining inflation (nearly ideal), to sheer uncertainty where inflation/deflation is the outcome of an unknown function of the network congestion over time. That is a terrible monetary policy! As ethereum gets more popular, the burnt basefee increases, which causes an increase in deflation, so users are incentivized to not spent their ETH on DAPPs. It essentially puts a hard asymptotic cap on Ethereum\u2019s economic growth. If you read all the crappy medium blogs written by proponents of this EIP you will find no sane economic rhetoric to support this change. What you will find is giddy propaganda talk such as \"This is great for people holding ETH!!\" or \u201cIf you hold ETH, you receive BASEFEE indirectly!!!\u201d. Pure populism to convince the layman holder. Advocates of this EIP seem to have dollar signs (or rather, ether signs) for eyes and, as such, have no problem damaging ether\u2019s usability as a currency as long at it pumps their bags. The EIP sends an incredibly weak economic signal: plain ETH holding must be artificially incentivized using a deflation ponzi (else people might sell their ETH for dollars or euros, oh no!). The side effects being of course that the number 1 \u2018product\u2019 that is purchased using ETH (gas for smart contracts) is now less attractive and general use as a currency is discouraged (compared to those dollars and euros). Make no mistake, being the first mover with smart contracts is the only thing that gives Ethereum any real value. The attractiveness of using a given cryptocurrency as a store of value is directly proportional to it\u2019s name recognition and stable monetary policy. Bitcoin is orders of magnitude ahead on the first and, after this EIP, will also have the advantage on the second. The worst part of this proposal is that there already exists a reward mechanism for people wiling to hold ETH, it\u2019s called staking (rings a bell anyone?). As long as rewards for staking are sufficiently higher than inflation (which they are) there is absolutely zero need for an unconditional incentive to hold ETH. The only people that stand to benefit are those that have no plans to lock their ETH in a long staking contract but instead hold ETH short term with the hope of converting it to fiat when the price has risen enough: soulless traders and speculators looking for a quick buck instead of a monetary revolution.

If EIP-1559 could plausibly be construed to promise steady inflation but actually result in sudden spikes of deflation, then the analogy to central banking might make some sense. If EIP-1559 could cause 16% of currency to disappear in the span of a single year, similar to M2 during 1931, then I would like to hear how. ",

The issue with this statement is that its taking a derived result and applying it where it does not belong. Why is low inflation the best target? Because a currency should grow alongside GDP in order to prevent hoarding and ensure smooth circulation of capital. But what is the GDP of ethereum? The goal of Eth is not to be the world currency. Nor will it necessarily be the primary currency even within Ethereum. At one time, people would roll their eyes at every new token and ask why things are not denominated in Eth, now its basically taken for granted that protocols will have their own token. These tokens, in combination with stablecoins, can ensure the free flow of capital within the system. Of course, I can\u2019t speak for everyone for what the purpose of Eth is. But insofar as the goal of Eth is to ensure the security and stability of Ethereum, although I don\u2019t know of any consensus as to what level of inflation is best, in my opinion there are two excellent benefits to slight deflation that scales with demand:  Demand side congestion control - if demand for gas exceeds supply (as it likely will the next while), eth becomes deflationary, causing less transactions to be sent and reducing congestion. \u201cFree\u201d security scaling - As the number of transactions sent increases the value of security rises. With deflation, the value of eth rises, increasing the cost of attacks on the network without having to do anything.  ",

This scales the grid by x2 from the current values.   @Galena1227 was right.  While 1559 means blocks can be double full, that\u2019s a very temporary flexibility and the base fee will pretty rapidly increase to ensure they don\u2019t stay that full.  On average blocks will still use 12.5 million gas so no significant change in capacity to today. ",

Rising ETH prices may not necessarily be good as it weakens the base of ETH\u2019s value, its usability. If a transaction costs 100 gwei to send and the price of that gwei doubles than users of ETH will be pushed to competing options. Deflation may be attractive in the short-term but in the long term it may leading to the weakening of ETH\u2019s fundamentals. Similar to how you don\u2019t want the value of your currency to rise too high in international trade. As miners would be facing a 50% loss in ETH this also means 50% less ETH is going to be available from miners on the market which combined with the fixed amount of ETH being staked could lead to liquidity issues. Especially as ETH is burned leading to lack of supply. We don\u2019t want ETH to be too expensive for users, for instance if they are selling a product for $100 US and their costs to use the ETH network at $1, once that goes up to $2 or $5 they may wish to switch.

The security needs of the blockchain don\u2019t coorelate with block space demand. Ethereum doesn\u2019t need more security during times when block space demand is high, and thus fees are high (like late 2020). Inversely, it doesn\u2019t need less security in times when block space demand is low (like early 2020). In other words, has anyone ever tried to model \u201chow much security spending do we need under conditions X\u201d, and looked at how it correlates with fees? The block reward has the weakness that it can\u2019t be adjusted quickly, and it hasn\u2019t ever been adjusted upwards so it\u2019s not clear we could get that past the community at all, especially under conditions where the security deficit comes from the value of ETH dropping.

Yes, and it is insanely complex and arguably chaotic.  Pretty much every model for \u201chow much security do we need\u201d is somewhat arbitrary.  It is possible that we are overpaying by many orders of magnitude, or it is possible that we are underpaying by a huge amount and have just gotten \u201clucky\u201d so far. With Proof of Stake the calculation becomes significantly easier because the cost of attacking is more constrained.  In PoS there aren\u2019t things like CapEx costs for building out an attacker mining farm and then immediately deprecating its value by launching an attack, which is quite hard to calculate the cost of and varies by location in the world. On Ethereum this problem is particularly hard because we cannot trivially calculate the \u201cvalue at risk per block\u201d.  With something like Bitcoin it is pretty easy to come up with an upper limit on how much value is at risk per block by just looking at the total value moved.  On Ethereum, you have to account for someone changing the owner of a contract that holds some funds (value which may be at risk). Of the theoretic value at risk, you further have to figure out how much is actually at risk, which is only the subset of that is going toward off-chain payments.  Any transfers from one person\u2019s account to another of their accounts isn\u2019t value at risk in this context and any contract executions in Ethereum that are entirely within Ethereum (like all of DeFi) are not value at risk.  Transfers to/from exchanges are the most obvious targets, but also things like paying for goods and services are at risk. Finally, of that value at risk it is unlikely that all of it (or even a significant portion of it) is value that an attacker cares about.  Alice sending money to an exchange and them crediting Alice puts the exchange at risk in the case of a 51% deep reorg, but only if Alice is the attacker.  If Alice is just some user sending money to an exchange then chances are the attack would just result in Alice\u2019s transaction being replayed in a different block, but the exchange would still get its money.

I agree with you @MicahZoltu that a censorship attack is the most likely form of attack to this proposal. Especially if the news are true that ~60% of the miners oppose this proposal it would be feasible for them to veto it from the outset and such an attack would be self-sustaining as you say in your blog post, because defectors would inevitably suffer a direct economic penalty from adopting the upgrade so they would have an individual incentive to join the majority strategy. It being obvious may not be a deterrent to everybody, in the same way that obviousness isn\u2019t a deterrent for a political party using their parlamentary majority in order to veto a bill. It doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of strategy that requires any sort of secrecy in order to be effective, it could conceivably be carried out in plain sight with a coordination website and github account distributing patches for mining software that block the upgrade\u2026 ",

Which chain has a higher security risk of being 51% attacked? Hint it is the 10% chain. Since you like ETC so much, what did exchanges do to their confirmation times when they were 51% attacked? ETC confirmation times went to two weeks So now which chain do you think people will use and therby exchanges? The chain with 2 weeks confirmation times?  The only possibility of this not happening is by July if the Defi ASICs that run MEV will have over 51%. In that case the Defi ASICs will control the fate of 1559 and we know which side they will land on since they have funded 1559 with grants. This is why July is so important as GPU supplies should catch up to ASICs by then. If it works out the way they plan Defi ASICs will have a very small window to ensure 1559 is the dominant chain in July. However one small miss on the launch date by a few months and GPUs will regain the majoirty of hashpower. But this is speculation that Defi thinks they will have the hashrate by then. Like you said, let\u2019s stick to the facts and right now 1559 will be an orphan chain with 10% hash and WILL get 51% attacked into oblivion. ",

Lacking a formal governance mechanism as @kladkogex was suggesting (which I agree would have some clear benefits to the greater community), the de facto form of governance we have lies in the individuals securing the network.  A vote is cast by using your hashpower in order to support one or the other chain. Even though that\u2019s the theory, in practice it would require some sort of coordinated action for the miner community to effectively block this proposal, since the individuals trying to implement this are coordinated.  At the very least some infrastructure able to reach a critical mass of miners and distribute patched mining software would be necessary for that to happen, and it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s happened yet so it may very well be that the majority of miners adopt the upgrade due to their own isolation or inaction, despite them being opposed to this EIP in principle. Regarding the conflict between ASIC and GPU miners I\u2019m not sure that it would make that much of a difference in the long run even if ASIC operators suddenly took over the majority of the network\u2019s hashpower, because even ASIC operators would have a strong economic incentive to veto this proposal, so the strategy of trying to push it through by bringing up enough ASICs supporting this EIP doesn\u2019t seem game-theoretically stable because defectors would be able to increase their profits instantly by joining the veto, so there is a good chance that the mining community will have the last word on this regardless of the increasing share of hashpower controlled by ASICs.

Is opposing miners to users a solution? It is terrible for me to see that everywhere on the social networks. I never stepped in on any platforms because I never felt the need. This time I noticed that many claimed to be spokespersons for users/holders or miners as if there were two distinct camps. the Defi was supposed to be different from cefi but it seems it is not for some of us. I am not happy with that because the loser is the network and the trust in it. That means each person which is part of this network (users, devs, holders, miners\u2026). I really do not feel to be part of one camp or the other. The majority of us is probably in the same situation. I prefer to still think that most people are like me, just expecting a solution to ease the tensions and make the network secured until it goes pos.

That\u2019s the competitive mining market dynamic at work, only someone telling them what branch of the fork they have to take would be usurping the decentralized decision of the individuals using their own resources to secure this network.  In the same way that I\u2019d think that a government requiring them to take a certain fork in order to censor certain transactions would be usurping their autonomy (since you talk about fiduciary and legal responsibility). I also don\u2019t identify with the false discrepancy between miners and what you call \u201cvalue additive community participants\u201d. I\u2019m primarily a transaction user and still can\u2019t help feeling skeptical about the theoretical benefits of this proposal: It has been acknowledged by core devs several times in this thread that it\u2019s not going to bring a meaningful reduction in the average transaction prices, which is the real usability problem a large fraction of the user base are suffering from right now.

Both miners and validators have the same incentive to veto this proposal, and the rest of the community have the same reasons to redirect some of the network surplus value to both of them: In either case their collective reward sets the minimum cost that an adversary needs to overcome in order to attack the chain successfully.  That\u2019s why I find it rather unfortunate that people are threatening to react to any attempt of coordinated action by rushing through the PoS upgrade \u2013 And you read these lines from a long-time skeptic of PoW (though mostly due to the environmental matter), but I don\u2019t think it does any favors to anyone to have it merged anytime before it\u2019s ready, and when it is it should be merged because it\u2019s ready not as retaliation against a part of the community.  In any case, assuming that miners are successful at blocking this proposal, wouldn\u2019t switching to PoS in a rushed manner only increase the attack surface and further sacrifice the security of this network (under the assumption that it was just successfully overruled!) rather than close any vulnerability?  What is going to prevent validators from coordinating in the future in exactly the same manner? ",

So I would not be surprised to see some measurable improvement in the average.   To a first degree of approximation, transaction prices are the result of a balance between supply and demand for gas.  This proposal is not expected to have an effect on the average supply of gas per block, nor on the demand for gas, nor on the marginal utility users extract out of transactions, so it\u2019s not going to change the bottom-line transaction prices close to equilibrium. It could conceivably lead to quicker convergence to equilibrium in some scenarios, but it could also lead to temporary oscillations as I\u2019ve argued before, or fully prevent convergence (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10567 for a wonderfully detailed analysis that even reaches the conclusion that the base fee can show chaotic behavior in certain scenarios). Will that lead to an overall improvement in the usability of the network as promised by the proposal?  In order to answer that question one would first need to define what is meant by \u201cusability\u201d in a quantifiable language, which developers have been reluctant to do in this thread so far.  Until then the promised benefits of this proposal are fully unfalsifiable.  Is it worth taking a reduction in the cost an adversary needs to overcome in order to attack the network (which can be estimated readily) for such an uncertain benefit? (Or worse, prematurely switching the network consensus mechanism for such an uncertain benefit) I\u2019d say no, until we have some quantitative understanding of what the benefit from this proposal is going to be.

So we may never be able to isolate the one specific variable of overpayment caused by imperfect information and the resulting inefficiency.   Yes, it would be fairly challenging to evaluate the effect of a change like this in production with a constantly changing environment, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been advocating for quantitatively testing the assumption that this proposal is going to improve usability in a setting where it could be falsified. Many of the methods people have been applying in the simulation notebooks and various quantitative analyses would be adequate, but unless the outcome of an experiment has the ability to invalidate our thesis (which requires a precise enough definition of what we\u2019re trying to achieve) we aren\u2019t doing any science, we\u2019re just using scientific language in order to give our opinion an aura of legitimacy.     esaulpaugh:  Is chaotic behavior bad? And is the first-price auction not an exemplar of chaos?   Chaos is neither a bad nor a good thing in itself, it just imposes some barriers to our understanding.  Even without bringing chaos into the picture it is easy to see that the base fee admits oscillatory solutions that might delay or prevent convergence to the equilibrium price (see the article I linked above if you\u2019re interested), achieving the opposite of what people intuitively think this proposal is going to achieve.  Hence my opinion that it would be risky to judge this proposal based on our intuition alone of what it ought to do because it is what people want it to do. A basic economic equilibrium analysis is sufficient to realize that it cannot have much of an effect on the equilibrium price (which is IMO the most pressing problem the Ethereum community is facing).  Of course that doesn\u2019t rule out this proposal having some sort of secondary benefit.  But what exactly?  Will it outweigh the almost certain security costs?  Will it outperform any of the cheaper and less controversial alternatives?  Its counter-intuitive behavior suggests that those are all questions beyond the reach of our intuition alone, only a quantitative analysis can provide the answers. ",

You might argue that an attack is still unlikely (which might be a valid assumption or not depending on the share of hashrate that moves over to London) so the expected cost to the network is still low, however so is the expected benefit (at least in relative terms compared to the exorbitant market-clearing prices we\u2019ll have to continue paying), which is why I think it\u2019s fair to ask whether one will outweigh the other, which I don\u2019t think is a question we can answer without some quantitative modeling.     esaulpaugh:  There are fee market proposals that will reduce inflation even more than EIP-1559?

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the primary objective of this proposal to reduce inflation, at least officially (I don\u2019t question that its deflationary effect is the primary reason why some people are in such a rush to move forward with this proposal despite the lack of consensus and of conclusive evidence that it\u2019s going to do more good than harm). And frankly, I think that the greatest mistake being made here is that this proposal conflates a monetary policy change (reduce inflation at the cost of security while precluding fixed supply) with a fee structure change (which is all it would take to achieve the promised usability improvement, whatever it is), even though it\u2019s not technically necessary to make both changes simultaneously (even Tim Roughgarden makes this suggestion in the article you linked above). Result is a level of polarization not seen in years that might break the community in two over a \u201cusability\u201d change.  I\u2019m starting to think that will be a fair outcome. ",

That being accompanied by a hashrate drop is certainly a possibility to keep in mind, but it\u2019s not central to my point and substantially more difficult to make predictions for: It could conceivably drop by under 20% or by over 80%, depending on how effectively miners coordinate to oppose this proposal.     esaulpaugh:  Remember that the entire point of Serenity is that miners should make zero dollars and zero cents per annum on the network.

The median is known to be very robust but even for the minimum, it is only enough to set this fraction to be of the same order as the number of transactions times the typical fee increment size for the last few transactions included in a block which is very low. Note that, after reducing volatility this will be even lower than before, thus stability helps security here.

                    "content": "@mtefagh, I was just wondering about a closely related attack when I came across this discussion. I agree with your analysis that the conditions for it to occur don\u2019t require a hostile adversary, a large enough number of mildly strategic users trying to save some gas could lead to this sort of instability causing unexpectedly high state growth and/or unexpectedly low base fees.  However it isn\u2019t difficult to see that the base fee drop across a single cycle of the base fee oscillation is substantially smaller than the amplitude of such oscillation (assuming that the adversary controls a relatively small share of transactions), so I was thinking that a strategic user would have a perverse incentive to delay transactions and send them as batches of double-full blocks in order to both profit off the periodic gas price drops due to the base fee oscillation and amplify any preexisting oscillation, even if they have no interest in depressing the base fee in a long-term attack as you were describing in your post. This has the potential of negating any usability improvements from this proposal, because: 1/ The oscillation would increase the chances of users overpaying above the \u201cfair\u201d market-clearing price, giving them a perverse incentive to bid below their marginal utility (which would reinforce any preexisting oscillation). 2/ Because it would potentially create periodic times of congestion where the pricing mechanism reverts to a first-price auction. 3/ Because of the rather unpredictable state growth I was complaining about earlier in this thread. I agree that making the base fee update formula path-independent as in EIP-3416 is a move in the right direction: It would certainly fix the state growth unpredictability and the long-term base fee drop you were describing.  However it wouldn\u2019t remove the incentive for users to cause such oscillations, because, if my understanding is correct, in EIP-3416 the base fee paid by the transactions of a block is only dependent on the gas usage of the previous blocks (just as is the case for this proposal), so the submitter of a double-full block doesn\u2019t pay any penalty whatsoever (only the subsequent blocks get to pay the price\u2026), and this short-term attack would still be profitable with either proposal.

Yes, like any other pump-and-dump scheme, you either join it or lose money otherwise. I agree with all your points that a long-time equilibrium seems to be every other block will be full with a very low base fee and first-price auctions determining the transactions, and the other blocks will have higher gas prices only for the urgent transactions which can\u2019t wait to join the next cycle of oscillation.     mdalembert:  I agree that making the base fee update formula path-independent as in EIP-3416 is a move in the right direction: It would certainly fix the state growth unpredictability and the long-term base fee drop you were describing.

Again, I have mentioned this very point two years ago in here (last paragraph)! I have also explained it more recently in here and here. However, I didn\u2019t mention this in EIP-3416 trying to not deviate too much from the original EIP-1559 making it too difficult to review for other people. ",

I have seen discussions about removing this block size limit or changing this coefficient. We should be very careful about these subjects in the future, as they both have the potential to make this attack driving the base fee to zero in a matter of minutes!   Hm. Removing the block size limit would make this attack massively more profitable since it would allow the adversary to batch up an arbitrarily large window of transactions without paying any price for it.  We should definitely be very careful about that.     mtefagh:  Note that, even if you don\u2019t want to tolerate this one single block delay, you can still simulate the same behavior by any kind of gas token.   Incidentally I\u2019m also of the opinion that gas tokens do more harm than good, but I don\u2019t think that the parallelism between them and this attack of EIP-1559 goes very far, on the one hand because all gas tokens I\u2019m aware of have some significant inefficiency, so the user always pays some non-negligible price for shifting some gas liquidity from block M to N, while this attack can transfer gas liquidity from block N+1 to N without incurring an increase in its total gas usage.  On the other hand because the user of a gas token still needs to compete for space in both blocks M and N (and this is the crucial advantage of not having a delayed gas price computation), so they would incur some substantial slippage if the amount of liquidity they\u2019re trying to displace is anywhere close to a full block worth of gas, while by taking advantage of this attack they would be able to hoard up to ~12.5M gas per block at constant price that only the transactions from future blocks will have to pay a penalty for (or an unlimited amount of gas if the block size limit is removed as you were saying  ).  The other critical difference is that to my knowledge gas tokens don\u2019t lead to long-term state growth beyond the expected bounds, while this attack almost certainly would due to the path-dependence you describe (which, yes, would be fixed by EIP-3416). Because of these differences I had the impression that gas tokens could be more of an aggravating circumstance rather than a simulation of this attack: Imagine a mining pool trying to recoup some of the revenue lost to EIP-1559 by taking advantage of any oscillations of the base fee and sending a block double-full with gas tokenization transactions anytime the base fee is particularly low.  Then they could resell these tokens at a profit whenever the base fee climbs back up and overshoots the average market-clearing price without causing their users the inconvenience of having to wait for the base fee to come down again.  While doing this they would constructively interfere with the base fee oscillation they\u2019d simultaneously be profiting off \u2013 And the greater the amplitude of this oscillation the greater their profits and the lower the usability of this proposal to the non-strategic user na\u00eff enough to send a transaction with their \u201chonest\u201d marginal utility specified as max fee per gas\u2026     mtefagh:  Again, I have mentioned this very point two years ago in here (last paragraph)! I have also explained it more recently in here and here. However, I didn\u2019t mention this in EIP-3416 trying to not deviate too much from the original EIP-1559 making it too difficult to review for other people.   That\u2019s fair. I agree that this is a serious problem, it\u2019s unfortunate that it hasn\u2019t gotten more attention so far buried behind a wall of comments. ",

Today, I was reading more about the market impact theories in the economy, and not only they define the permanent price impact which is the same as our discussion here (affects the current transaction and the ones after that), but also they introduce a temporary price impact which translates to affecting only the current block and not the next ones! Moreover, even there are theories of elastic markets in which the magnitude of temporary price impact dominates permanent price impact which is quite the opposite of EIP-1559. BTW, I have not found anything in which there is zero market impact for the transaction itself. This brings me to suggest that we can still use EIP-1559 for the temporary price impact if we want to have a multiplicative formula that is supposedly more responsive, but for the permanent price impact, it is absolutely necessary to consider a path-independent update rule! Moreover, we can have an exponential path-independent dynamic pricing formula that is super responsive. For a thorough comparison from the economic literature, see here. ",

Just quoting some lines from the abstract and concluding remarks:  We show that when the price impact of trades is permanent and time-independent, only linear price-impact functions rule out quasi-arbitrage and thus support viable market prices. When trades have also a temporary price impact, only the permanent price impact must be linear while the temporary one can be of a more general form.   \u2026 On the other hand, if the price-impact and price-update functions are independent, then only the price-update function must be linear in trading volume, while the temporary price impact can have various forms without offering quasi-arbitrage opportunities. The theoretical microstructure literature usually assumes that the change in prices is time-independent and reacts linearly to trading volume. This paper demonstrates that the assumption of time independence of price changes already implies the linearity of the price-update function.  Translation to our case:  Round trips are the fluctuations and oscillations we are talking about. The price manipulation strategy translates to our path-dependence attack. I have already explained the temporary (only affects the individual transaction that has also triggered it) and permanent price impact (affects all current and future transactions equally) in my previous post. Furthermore, there exist transient price impacts that will decay over time. Altogether, this suggests using the additive linear term in EIP-3416 which does not admit price manipulation, while we can add other terms as temporary price impacts.  ",

                    "content": "Interesting reads, thanks. I suspect that this form of attack (or shall I say abuse, intentional or not) provides a counter-example to the thesis that this proposal is incentive-compatible for users.  Tim Roughgarden has a proof for its user incentive-compatibility in page 27 of his article, however his proof is local to a single block, so it doesn\u2019t consider the possibility of a user maximizing their utility by not submitting the transaction and waiting until the next block if they can determine that the base fee is decreasing due to blocks being under-full. Ironically the strictly delayed price impact that makes this attack particularly profitable (even in a relatively stable market close to the steady state) seems to be intended to make the pricing mechanism incentive-compatible for miners (there\u2019s plenty of commentary about this in Tim\u2019s article as well), so this seems like a case of inadvertently giving users a tool for price manipulation while trying to prevent miners from doing the same. That means that there is a theoretical benefit from the delay but I think that it also comes at a cost of economic efficiency.  Suppose that the market is initially near equilibrium with a base fee close to its optimal market-clearing price (call it p0) when the network is perturbed with a double-full block added to the blockchain at time t0, causing a temporary price impact lasting between t1 and tn, at which point the base fee drops back to within some arbitrary threshold dp of the previous equilibrium price: In such a scenario a total of ~12.5M gas capacity of the blocks between t1 and tn will have been auctioned off at p0, displacing ~12.5M gas worth of users with higher marginal utility of the order of p0+dp \u2013 An example of economic inefficiency. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s inconsistent with @vbuterin\u2019s argument justifying the economic efficiency of this pricing mechanism in his article.  His argument seems to be mostly concerned with this mechanism being efficient on the average (e.g. the average cost paid by users approximating the average social cost born by the operators of the network).  However a pricing mechanism may seem to be efficient on the average while remaining highly inefficient locally if you focus on any specific case, e.g. if the price paid by different users is largely disconnected from their share of responsibility in the social cost of running the network, or if the revenue obtained from users is disproportionately distributed to speculators (through the base fee burn) instead of to the individuals actually bearing the cost of running the network.

                    "content": "Hi everyone. What if we use the basefee as a means to incentivize the miners to future hard fork activity? Fee volatility is due to the fee bidding war. And it seems the progressively growing basefee would do the job well. The focus is on where the basefee goes. Burning it seemed like a good way to keep the incentives of multiple parties since \u2018nobody\u2019 gets it. But what if these basefee could accrue in a \u2018bank\u2019 and this amount is used for the miners(and validators) for the future protocol upgrades? The basefee accrued could be evenly distributed to the miners once the hard fork is done as the general ethereum community intended. This could work as an incentive to align and organize the overall miners whenever there is a hard fork. If there is any MEV opportunity available, it\u2019s gonna happen anyway. So 1559 doesn\u2019t fix this. Only slows it down. How I see is 1559 isn\u2019t mean to punish anyone or hurt anyone\u2019s opportunity to, let\u2019s say, profit. If the basefee, which is meant not to be used as a cause of deviation, does the job well for keeping the fee volatility within a predictable range, this could have more utility if it had other uses.

If the step- size exceeds these bounds, then the base fee adjustment rule may lead to chaotic updates. As mentioned above, these bounds depend on the number of arrivals, \u03bb, and in the range of valuations, w. If \u03bb increases or w decreases, i.e., if the system becomes more congested or if the valuations become more concentrated around a specific value, then the thresholds go down and a given step-size may not be enough to guarantee convergence. In fact, as we will show, for any step-size, there exists a (reasonably large) \u03bb and a (reasonably small) w so that the dynamics become chaotic.\u201d . \u2026 For more remarks, and also Tim Roughgarden replies to what is said about Deflation, check  mobile.twitter.com    pnkj.eth (pankaj)  In early 2000s, the successful ad auction models of search engines invited rigorous studies from the best CS minds in industry and academia.

                    "content": "@editor-Ajian is correct to point out that the basefee is essentially a tax on transactions. But the tax can improve welfare if it is a Pigouvian tax designed to correct for negative externalities of larger blocks. Also, one may argue that miners\u2019 supply of block space is perfectly inelastic as long as they are compensate d for uncle risk, and that the risk is linear in gas used in the block. Hence, even if the level of the tax is higher than what is necessary to correct the externalities, it can transfer MEV from miners to the protocol (i.e. ETH holders) without causing much distortion or hurting the users of the protocol. The fundamental issue with EIP-1559 is not that it introduces a tax, it is who the tax is levied on. Under the current format, the users who use the protocol after it has been congested pay higher basefees. As pointed out by @STAGHA, this is akin to making night drivers pay a higher toll because the road was congested during the day. This mistargeted taxation is unfair, causes congestion, and intensifies gas auctions. It fails to address the negative externality that a Pigouvian tax is supposed to internalize. In fact, I am a bit surprised that this was pointed out more than two years ago but has not led to a wider discussion. When a block is congested, users of that block should be the ones paying the fee. Let me reproduce below my post on ethresear.ch that describes the problems of EIP-1559 in more detail and suggests a preliminary model for an optimal fee design. The Problem EIP-1559 will introduce a protocol fee on Ethereum transactions and allow the block size to be dynamically adjusted in response to congestion. Charging a protocol fee when the chain is congested is an efficient way to shift MEV from miners to ETH holders without hurting the users. Also, a flexible block size makes the allocation of block space more efficient. However, under the current fee structure, the wrong people can end up paying for congestion. Suppose there are two blocks, and we target an average block size of one transaction per block. There are two users, Alice and Bob. Normally, Alice sends one transaction in Block 1, and Bob sends one transaction in Block 2. Now, suppose Alice receives a shock and wants to send two transactions in Block 1. EIP-1559 allows her to do so; as long as she pays enough to compensate for the increased uncle risk, the miner will include both of her transactions in Block 1. This is great for Alice. However, because Block 1 was larger than the target size, the base fee is increased in Block 2. This means that Bob either has to pay the higher base fee or wait a block to send his transaction. Bob ends up paying for the congestion that Alice caused. In general, when users congest a block, it is users of the subsequent blocks that pay for the congestion. This is undesirable for a couple of reasons. 1. It is unfair. It is not fair that Bob should pay to allow Alice to send an extra transaction. 2. It increases congestion. Because Alice does not care whether Bob pays more, she will congest her block whenever she has the slightest need to do so. In economics jargon, congesting a block exerts a negative externality on the users of future blocks. Because users do not pay for congesting their block, they will congest it too much relative to what is socially optimal. 3. It intensifies gas auctions. Let us change our example and assume that Alice and Bob are competing to include their transactions in Block 1, which is expected to be congested. If Bob loses, he will not only have his transaction delayed, he will also pay a higher base fee in Block 2. So outbidding Alice becomes even more important. The same will hold for Alice, and as a result, the gas auction will become more intense. Users will pay larger tips to miners to avoid paying higher base fees to the protocol. A Solution I propose that when a block is congested, the users of that same block pay for the congestion. We can implement this by charging the miner a fee based on how much gas is used in his block. For example, a miner who uses $x$ gas in his block might be required to pay $f(x)=kx^2$ gwei where $k>0$ is some constant. The marginal cost of including one additional gas is $2kx$ gwei, so the miner will include all transactions that pay him at least $2kx+\\epsilon$ gwei per gas until he reaches the block limit, where $\\epsilon$ is compensation for uncle risk. We can think of $2kx$ as a Pigouvian tax on block space. When the demand for block space is high, $x$ will be large (block size will be large), $kx^2$ will be large (the protocol fee will be large), and $2kx$ will be high (users will have to pay more to be included). Hence block space will adjust to demand, and we can calibrate the fee function $f(x)$ to target the average block size that we want. Technical Asides It should not matter in theory whether we charge the miner or the users. But charging the miner may be easier to implement. To choose $f(x)$, we could use a supply and demand model of block space where the social cost of centralization risk is an increasing function of the average block size. We would solve for $f(x)$ that makes the agents internalize the social cost, while ensuring that users do not bear too much of the tax burden. ",

                    "content": "Summary The large oscillations in the block fullness (see Coindesk\u2019s chart at bottom) was said in a Coindesk article to be caused by the new EIP-1559 base fee calculation. The goal is very much like the difficulty adjustment where the difficulty target has been replaced by the base fee and the solvetime is replaced by block  fullness (both have a target they are trying to achieve). The EIP-1559 algorithm is the best possible for difficulty algorithms except for the very low setting seen in BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR = 8. This would be pretty bad in difficulty algorithms due to resulting in similar oscillations (it\u2019s like a simple moving average using only the past 16 blocks\u2026 see Karbo oscillations in next comment). It probably needs to be increased a lot. 30 would be a fast, tolerable difficulty algorithm and 100 to 500 would be a lot better. The 2000 that ETH uses for it\u2019s similarly-functioning DA is probably way too large. The base fee calculation has a strong parallel to difficulty algorithms, but it\u2019s hard to see how strong. Those paying fees are like miners on small coins who can come or go, amplifying oscillations. It\u2019s not an exponential distribution, but the algorithm being used is durable for different distributions. Details The EIP-1559 code (see below) is called \u201cWTEMA\u201d by difficulty algorithm enthusiasts. It\u2019s the same as ETH\u2019s difficulty algorithm but not as staccato, mathematically inverted (for the better), and uses an N=8 blocks instead of N=2000. Here\u2019s the simple math of EIP-1559, ignoring rounding error: GF = base gas fee F = block fullness in parent block as fraction of parent's target fullness GF = parent_GF * (1 - 1/8 + F/8)  GF goes up as F increases above 1, so in difficulty algorithms, the parallel is that we replace GF with target (aka 2^256/difficulty) and F is parent_solvetime / target_solvetime. Except for N=8 being really low, this is close to the best possible algorithm. If N=8 is substantially larger than F, it\u2019s equal to all of the following due to e^x = 1+x for small x where x = (F-1)/8  1st order IIR filter.  See [1] for this and next 2 Electronic RC filter (8-blocks) on how long it will take the error signal in the previous output sample to be applied on the same scale as the input signal. Kalman filter if the target value is a scalar random walk. Ideal EMA (exponential moving average) when applied to the exponential distribution of solvetimes in  difficulty algorithms[3]. F=previous solvetime per target solvetime. GF =  target = 2^256 / difficulty. BCH\u2019s new difficulty algorithm ASERT. (Lundeberg & Toomin, same result as above Imperial College paper)  You can use e^x =~ 1+x approximation to confirm it\u2019s equal to the following. Ideal DA EMA / ASERT in \"relative\" form: F = previous solvetime per target solvetime.  GF = target = 2^256 / difficulty. GF = parent_GF * e^((F-1)/8)    In difficulty algorithms, N=8 is insanely low and causes these kind of oscillations. F does not look like the same units as blocks which is what I interpreted the 8 to mean. To correct this serious problem (especially for the RC and difficulty algorithm parallels that are based on time), F can be interpreted as \u201cnumber of blocks\u201d to get \u201c1 target-blocks-worth of fees\u201d. EMA / ASERT are ideal for difficulty algorithms, but they have an exponential distribution. This seems to be important only in keeping it accurate for low N. This situation is probably not an exponential distribution so it may not be expected to work as well for low N, but for higher N, this algorithm is probably the best + simple that can be found.

While I\u2019m not opposed to changing the divisor, keep in mind that the primary goal (IMO) is user experience, which means strong guarantees that we don\u2019t have many consecutive full blocks (because then people end up with stuck/pending transactions), and a secondary goal of minimizing the base fee change per block. For a first attempt, I\u2019m actually very happy with 8 because we see multiple full blocks in a row very rarely so far (though this may change as people switch to 1559 transactions), and 12.5% increase per block isn\u2019t too high.  We may be able to raise the denominator a bit without increasing the chances of many consecutive full blocks too significantly, but we need to be careful about breaking the primary target of \u201clow probability of consecutive full blocks\u201d. Also, I don\u2019t think we should do much judging until end-users are widely using 1559 transactions.

                    "content": "Oscillations are a lot less efficient due to area under the curve being less for a given sum of the y values. Average base fee per block and average miner or staker bandwidth (computation and communication) requirements are (much?) higher due to the oscillations. Anyone needing to process and relay blocks ASAP (<1 second) has to have 2x the bandwidth for 1 or 2 blocks and then let the higher bandwidth sit idle for 2 or 3 blocks. Higher bandwidth requirements should cause higher gas prices, not just delayed txs. The parallel between this and difficulty algorithms is strong. This seems more susceptible to oscillations because user can not only delay txs (like miners jumping from one alt coin to the next), but they also must come back at some point to send their txs (they don\u2019t have an alternate coin to \u201cmine\u201d). I spent a long time working on the difficulty oscillation problem in alt coins (see my github issues). The awful Karbo difficulty chart above with N=8 was my first algorithm. The solution was to make the averaging time very long, like N>100, and to remove any caps. Maybe there is a reason you can\u2019t have blocks that are 10x bigger (or costly). In difficulty, the parallel would be a huge miner jumping on for \u201ccheap\u201d blocks. But they are not cheap because it\u2019s a fair, long-term \u201caverage\u201d cost. Removing the cap isn\u2019t as important as increasing \u201caveraging\u201d window length, but it prevents the base fee from rising as fast as it should when there\u2019s higher demand that the algo can\u2019t see (due to the cap). The average block size (or computation gas) should be as easy to target and achieve as the average solvetime in difficulty algorithms. Software might be developed to competitively exploit low fees. It\u2019s a zero sum game, except if everyone uses the best software, no will get lower fees than others and it will reduce the oscillations (giving higher efficiency due to efficient competition). The net effect is if EIP-1559 had used a longer averaging window. ",

Those willing to wait for txs to go through should have a lower base fee in exchange for waiting longer. EIP-1559 seems to try to assist in that goal. Here\u2019s an idea to do it that builds on EIP-1559.  Assign 1/4 the desired avg gas per block (avgGPB) to 889 out of every 1000 blocks and allow every 10th, 100th, and 1000th block to have gas per block targets of 10/4, 100/4, and 1000/4 times avgGPB. I don\u2019t know if motivating 250x the normal gas every 1000th block like this is OK. Each of the 4 tranches has an independent base fee per gas calculation using the current formula which is, BF = prior_BF * (1 - 1/8 + F/8) but based only on their particular tranche\u2019s parent block\u2019s F = \u201cfullness fraction\u201d: F = tranche_parent_block_gas / tranche_gas_target. tranche_gas_target = avgGPB * traunch / 4 traunch = 1, 10, 100, 1000. A much better and complicated way is to equally share total base fees in the tranches instead of equally sharing total gas (over their respective intervals). It would greatly lower the really high tranche_gas_targets constant above by making it a variable. I haven\u2019t worked out how to do it. I said oscillations are inefficient because they require a higher bandwidth to \u201cstop and go\u201d. In other words, the average bandwidth required of the nodes (if they have to get the block out ASAP) is higher for a given amount of gas \u201cper 100 blocks\u201d if the bandwidth (gas per block) is changing up and down. But having the slower-tranche txs available ahead of time allows the bandwidth to be spread out, i.e. the bytes can be propagated and validated ahead of time. ",
