                    "content": " Signal Support for Ending DAI Funding for Sourcecred The Governance Facilitators will be putting a poll on-chain next week to gauge MKR voter support for removing DAI funding for both Sourcecred instances for delegates and non-delegates. We are escalating this directly to MKR voters as, ultimately, money being spent on this program belongs to MKR holders. Provision for this action is granted to the Governance Facilitators as specified in MIP16 and MIP41. If voters see it as valuable and wish it to continue, we will continue to fund it from our budget. However, if MKR voters feel we should stop funding the program, we will discontinue funding Sourcecred once the October distributions have been paid out at the start of November.  Current Situation Currently, GovAlpha spends 1,000 DAI per week on the delegate instance and 2,500 DAI per week on the non-delegate instance. In Q2-2022, this was approximately one-quarter of the Core Unit\u2019s DAI expenses, this figure does not include costs of administering the program. We have become increasingly concerned that Sourcecred is no longer delivering net-positive value for the DAO. As a Core Unit, we have spent some time over recent months discussing alternative parameters for Sourcecred and have run some simulations with these new parameters enabled. We have been unable to settle on something that we think is a reasonable improvement on the status quo. One possible course of action would be withdrawing the funding to the program. There are pros and cons to removing the Sourcecred instance. We have tried to present both sides of the discussion here.  Reasons for Discontinuing Sourcecred  Despite spending time studying the effect of SourceCred, GovAlpha has thus far been unable to identify positive results from the program that could not be plausibly explained by other causes. There is a high noise-to-signal ratio on the forum. This has been noted by GovAlpha, members of other CUs, Recognized Delegates, and community members. This is potentially exacerbated by rewarding participation in discussions. Low-effort posts being monetized have led to greater demands on the moderation team. This distracts from the foundational duties of running Core Units (all four active forum moderators are CU facilitators) and is an avoidable distraction. Due to the monetary reward of Sourcecred, this can often devolve into personal attacks on the motivations of the forum moderators from individuals involved as they have a financial incentive in their post remaining unmoderated, taking up yet more time. Rewarded posts and categories do not necessarily reflect participation in the governance of the DAO, instead rewarding sharing of tangentially related news articles or translating forum posts into Spanish (sometimes inaccurately).   Note: we see value in the ongoing translation of certain threads (such as MIPs and the Maker Operational Manual), but the recent trend of translating forum posts en masse is disconcerting and suggests farming of Sourcecred rewards and leads to forum clutter. The usefulness of these translations is difficult to gauge. SourceCred\u2019s only moderating effort is the use of likes, which can prove inefficient for grading the quality of translations.   Time cost of administering the program - a not insignificant number of GovAlpha\u2019s hours are spent on administering Sourcecred each month. This extends from signing up new members, running the instance, generating payouts, verifying payouts, and submitting payment transactions. At a conservative estimate, this is between 10-20 hours of work each month. Ending the program will allow us to spend this time on more productive output.  On a personal level, I would like to add that as other Core Units are the subject of offboarding proposals citing costs, then it makes sense for us to evaluate whether our own spending is also good value for the DAO. At present, it is my personal belief that Sourcecred is not providing good value.  Reasons for Keeping Sourcecred  Sourcecred can drive enthusiasm for participation in Maker Governance. For many, this is a means for their voice and opinions to receive tangible rewards and value. If Governance approves the Endgame proposals, Sourcecred may have a role in metaDAOs as they seek to grow their communities. There is a well-worn progression of people starting as contributors to the forum and receiving Sourcecred payouts before joining a Core Unit or even becoming Recognized Delegates. Stopping payments could see this flow of labor stop. SourceCred remains one of the few options for getting paid by the DAO without \u201cjoining the workforce.\u201d Removing its presence may have a centralizing effect where only people approved by the Core Units will be able to invest the time required to meaningfully participate in MakerDAO. Delegates currently have large potential volatility with their pay from participating in voting. SourceCred offers another way to get compensated for their time that is not dependent on individual delegator preferences.   Next Steps We will stop funding Sourcecred after the October distributions if this vote passes. We will look at alternative methods of rewarding participation, which may include monetary or non-monetary rewards and will report back once we have settled on a preferred method. This may or may not include reinitializing Sourcecred with different parameters/rules. In the meantime, any DAI savings due to this reduction in costs will be returned to the Protocol. If this vote fails, we will continue funding Sourcecred at the current levels but will aim to present a package of reforms to the Program by the end of November for approval by Governance vote. ",

Speaking candidly, SourceCred was a nice bonus when I first started getting involved with Maker, particularly to help justify the massive time sink required to ascend the Maker learning curve and understand how the different parts of the protocol fit together. I didn\u2019t specifically go out to try and maximise my cred, but on the margins it probably did help encourage me to post higher-quality (or at least, attempted high-quality) contributions on the forum. It\u2019s worth noting that the Maker forum still sees higher quality discourse for the most part than other communities in crypto (a low bar, but still). However, it\u2019s hard to qualify the impact SourceCred has on that quality. I agree with Patrick that the noise-to-signal ratio on the forum has been exacerbated, particularly over the last few months, so it seems reasonably likely that the forum could see better discourse without SourceCred. On the other hand, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the only people who continue to regularly post are CU members and Recognized Delegates - this seems suboptimal given we are a DAO at the end of the day. Overall, I tentatively agree that SourceCred is no longer serving a helpful purpose, but my strong preference would be to replace it with alternative methods of rewarding participation as noted above - with an eye to building an inclusive community and encouraging prospective Maker workers to dip their toes in.

Parts of that is getting intimately familiar with the forums and keeping a constant vigilance of what is going on there. Having good knowledge of the forums makes a person well positioned to comment on and making meaningful input on various topics being discussed. Now this is expected from delegates and as such shouldn\u2019t warrant compensation on its own. However, the delegates we have now should not be expected to last forever. As such there is a need for new delegates to cut their teeth. Allowing prospective delegates to earn sourcecred will give a breeding ground of sorts. The basic sourcecred also gives some feedback on what the community cares about. At the same time I don\u2019t think delegates with a decent compensation should receive further compensation for actions that is expected to be part of the role. Delegate compensation is tied to the total amount of MKR delegated. It is also influenced by performance metrics. To tie this together I therefore suggest that sourcecred be kept among delegates but reduced with the inverse of the factor used to determine compensation based on number of MKR delegated. That way large delegates will receive very little if anything, but prospective or delegates with low MKR will receive the majority and can more easily stay on and challenge the incumbent delegates.

The rationale for removing both instances for the short term is that if we left the delegate instance intact, there would be an incentive to sign up as a Recognized Delegate just to access Sourcecred payouts. This would be exacerbated if smaller Recognized Delegates were entitled to a larger \u201cslice of the pie\u201d. There would be no requirement to put in the effort as a delegate to attract MKR if access to Sourcecred was the intended outcome, and if Sourcecred were weighted to smaller RDs, accumulation of MKR to the relevant contract would be disincentivized. My assumption here is that this would result in multiple new RDs coming forwards and would not discourage the problematic behaviour that we are targeting with the removal of payments. Therefore, we felt it more appropriate to pause both instances while investigating alternatives. This is intended to be a temporary pause in governance mining incentives. At the same time, we are researching alternatives. Still, we feel that the current situation may have become untenable, which caused us to suggest stopping payouts while investigating options. I like your idea of allowing smaller delegates a greater proportion of the rewards, and we can certainly see if any proposed solution will allow this. ",

My counter argument is that to become a RD you need to go through a lot more work than signing up for sourcecred. You even have to create a delegate contract which carries an actual cost (even though that is a lot lower than it used to be). The difference in compensation between sourcecred and MKR delegated is at least an order of magnitude apart which means that there exists a clear compensation incentive to chase more MKR. Furthermore I see no reason you couldn\u2019t also tie delegate performance metrics to the sourcecred reward as well meaning continuous activity would be required. Now, this might not fully address the concern about the quality of the content produced, but it does drive it towards individuals willing to put in more effort up front as well as showing a willingness to put some resources on the line.

At least from my experience, I\u2019d say that the point you make below applies to anyone who starts from scratch and gets to the point where they\u2019re contributing to Maker in some meaningful way. The forum lets you explore Maker and decide how you want to be involved.     JustinCase:  Having good knowledge of the forums makes a person well positioned to comment on and making meaningful input on various topics being discussed. As such there is a need for new delegates to cut their teeth. Allowing prospective delegates to earn sourcecred will give a breeding ground of sorts.   I suspect that the ideal version of SC would make no distinction between delegates, CU contributors and other posters. The issue with keeping only one instance alive is that it pushes people to become delegates - it would be the first thing any new user would sign up for. What we want is for the forum to be a pipeline for CU contributors and informed members of the community too. What SC would ideally do is cut off two types of posters - the low-effort posters who are here for SC indefinitely and the well-paid posters who don\u2019t need SC. It\u2019s in between these two where one finds posters who could potentially be valuable contributors to Maker and for whom SC might be the difference between staying and leaving. It is easy to cut out those who receive large salaries from the protocol. It is much harder to have a system that cuts off users who post low-level comments in the hope of getting some Dai and also not discourage those with genuine intent to learn and contribute. ",

While SourceCred is a nominal expense for the DAO, its incentive mechanism infects discussions rapidly and creates false expectations. Rewarding commentating on proposals miss a Governance forum\u2019s critical goal: education, iteration, and better decision-making. I would be more inclined to reinvest these funds into the following program, creating more integrations and improvements for users to vote on within MakerDAO.     prose11:  We very much intend to keep our Off-Chain Proposal Bounties  program and look for more targeted ways to use our incentives budget regardless of the outcome of this vote. We\u2019ll be processing the second payout from this program this month with the potential for many more soon.   Proposals at their core require discussions and participation from the community; this is achieving SourceCred\u2019s goal while also producing proposals.
