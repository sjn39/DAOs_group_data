Internally, I\u2019ve been working with Amy Jung, LongForWisdom, and the Mandated Actors, and I believe that I would complement their skillset to achieve scale and decentralization. The Operational Support domain is an accumulation of a lot of the work we\u2019ve been doing in the background. Given my experience, I would primarily* focus on:   People: help the different teams to translate strategy into the needed skills, profiling, budgeting, and recruiting strategy. Onboarding, training, and scaling of the teams (knowledge transfer).  Financial and Operational Health: financial models / KPIs, compensation improvement + tracking, operational performance; assist with decentralization.  Product Growth: customer(s) journey definition, acquisition, onboarding and feedback loops, metrics / KPIs, product development, assist with  integrations and partnerships (if applicable)  *I\u2019m expecting these to shift as the DAO evolves, but Collateral Onboarding is the main objective for the foreseeable future. Credentials  7+ years in Fintech (3+ in FX; 2+ in Assets Management) Studied Finance, IT, and Entrepreneurship. Product + Project Management 5+ years Operations + Financial Transformation Manager Comm-Dev team: helping set up and grow a translations team, a bunch of CDIPs and the already existing Governance Summary team. Collateral onboarding  helped put together the Collateral Onbarding Framework Model  hosted numerous calls with the community and invited various projects of the wider crypto-community (Aave, Curve, Uniswap, 1inch, Balancer, GUSD, TUSD, etc) hosted calls with the RWA team and several projects: 6s Capital, New Silver, ConsolFreight, (Paperchain + RealT on the way)   Once I did a diagram  Writer of a (blog?) where I explain/categorize blockchain projects  Relevant Information  Github: https://github.com/juan-fintech  Forum: @juanjuan  Twitter: @0Ju4n  Site: https://DeFiNotes.com   ",

More recently, I\u2019ve been working closely with LongForWisdom and other community members through working groups such as Autonomous MakerDAO and SourceCred, and Collateral Onboarding Initiatives. The Operational Support domain is an accumulation of a lot of the work we\u2019ve been doing in the background. Given my experience, I would primarily focus on:   Resourcing: Bridge and manage effective resource distribution from Maker Foundation and the Protocol.  People: Identify, recruit, and support individuals of diverse backgrounds in domain teams. Incubate and provide funding for smaller working group/proto-teams.  Onboarding Experience: Map end-to-end experience for onboarding domain members, including providing operational support for initial team setup.  Bounties and Grants: Produce and manage additional incentives to promote further growth of important initiatives and provide a path to contributing to a domain.  Credentials  Currently Head of Community Development at Maker Foundation as recommended by Rich Brown MakerDAO Community Development contributor since July 2019 for Program Operations & Strategy Active in Ethereum since 2017, and worked as Design Operations Lead at ConsenSys and incentivized testnet launch at cLabs (Celo) Previous work as a consultant to early stage startups (Program Director at a retail and CPG accelerator), and program development for universities (Columbia, Fordham).
