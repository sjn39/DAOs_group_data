The weekly cycle is a process that grew completely organically, and thus has a lot of problematic edge cases, in addition to being way too fast and loose for making big long term changes - and ultimately containing a lot of risk that could potentially blow up and cause issues later due to malicious or bad proposals that could get pushed through too fast with not enough oversight. In the Foundation MIPs working group we are preparing to create one or more MIPs that will formalize the weekly cycle into a more streamlined process that primarily exists to deal with a few specific things where a weekly cycle is appropriate, namely SF/DSR adjustments, debt ceiling adjustments, and time sensitive proposals - and put some constraints and checks in place to de-risk its use outside of those categories in order to instead direct general proposals to the full MIPs process of the monthly cycle. In order to support the near consensus that has already been reached regarding the new SF structure, we will also include the new base rate structure directly in the first draft of the proposal, even if this executive vote doesn\u2019t pass, so it will be formalizing the weekly cycle as it would look assuming this proposal passed. And of course keep in mind that it\u2019s just going to be another proposal that will go into RFC, and then put to a vote in the monthly cycle, so the community will be able to offer input and create competing MIPs, just like with the MIPs that have already been ratified.

Unlike Rune, I don\u2019t believe that the MIPs process solves the problem satisfactorily (though it may prove to alleviate the severity of the issue.) It\u2019s really important imo not to conflate the following two issues:  There should be a strict schedule for votes, such that everyone knows when they need to pay attention, and when they don\u2019t. Votes should be atomic in that each issues is voted on separately (though potentially in one transaction after going through a pick-and-choose UI)  These issues can be solved with a process where a large set of atomic votes occur at a fixed time every month. If a group wants to come together and start an anti-bundling campaign movement of some sort I\u2019d love to be involved. I have a couple of ideas for implementation, but the change isn\u2019t costless, so it will require a coordinated movement to make change happen in this area. ",

                    "content": "So, yeah there are complexities to this that aren\u2019t super obvious. A couple of points: On vote.makerdao.com This is controlled by the governance facilitators if you are feeling charitable, and the Foundation if you aren't. Anyone can submit on-chain executives or polls, however they will not appear on the frontend unless they come from a set of whitelisted addresses. On System Defence The obvious first order solution to bundling is to simply put up multiple executive votes on-chain at once, each containing a single change. However, this causes a serious issue with regards to defending the system from governance attack. The threshold to reach for each executive to pass is to 'beat' the current highest executive, because of this, splitting MKR across many executives is bad, and makes it easier for an actor to attack the governance system with a smaller amount of MKR. On Slates and Multiple Voting A little known fact is that the smart contracts allow voting on multiple executives at once, however this is not supported by the front end for reasons of complexity. However, even if the front-end did support multiple-proposal-voting there remains the issue that each executive still needs to have the most MKR before it can be executed. Say you vote for three executives under this system, you would expect the most popular to pass first. But then, everyone that voted for it needs to change their vote to exclude that executive in order to \u2018clear the way\u2019 for the other executives to pass. On Complexity In terms of complexity, the change itself is not that complex (at least so far as I understand.) The minimal change to allow atomic voting is to change the 'pass/fail system' from: A proposal must exceed the highest proposal to get the hat to A proposal must exceed a percentage of MKR locked in voting contract DSChief (50% by default) to get a hat This allows multiple proposals to have access to the protocol at once, and allows us to pass things atomically. On Migration Edit: Rune added some additional clarity below, which may simplify any migration. So far, so good. However here is where we meet the sticking point. The current implementation of DSChief does not support a frictionless migration. Migration is possible, but it\u2019s quite dangerous and requires a lot of coordination between MKR Holders to do safely. MKR has to move from the old contract to the new contract, and also maintain the \u2018hat\u2019 in both versions during the migration period in order to ensure that the system is secure from governance attack throughout the process. Subsequently, after the migration takes place, all the MKR that is in the old contract needs to move to the new one to secure the system (see system defence above.) ",
