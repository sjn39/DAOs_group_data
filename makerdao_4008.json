                    "content": " Background Maker faces difficulties with maintaining vault types that have low usage. While our stability fee revenue directly correlates with the total amount minted against a collateral asset, our primary operating expense of maintaining oracle price feeds does not - rather it is dependent on prevailing ETH and gas prices. This creates a situation where we need a certain minimum amount of DAI minted to operate vault types profitably. The minimum required usage depends on a variety of factors, including the vault stability fee, ETH price, gas price, and oracle sensitivity (eg does the oracle update price on 1% variation, or less frequently on eg 3% variation in price). So while the exact cutoff for when a vault type becomes unprofitable varies, there is general agreement among the core units that collaterals requiring their own price feed with less than 10 million DAI minted are operated at a loss. In addition, Maker also bears lending risk on the associated vaults. With this in mind, MakerDAO can consider offboarding assets with very low usage that lack a realistic prospect of becoming profitable in the future. This could improve financial performance with minimal impact on DAI supply and user experience, and allow MakerDAO to direct these resources towards more impactful goals.  Choosing Assets to Offboard First, Maker must decide which assets will be offboarded. We propose a three part test:  Is total DAI minted against the collateral asset (and all others sharing the same price feed) more than 10 million DAI? Is there a realistic prospect of the total amount minted reaching 10 million DAI within 6 months? Does Maker gain a significant benefit for retaining the collateral type that offsets the costs?  Eg. Is the oracle price feed used for other purposes, or sold to clients outside of MakerDAO? This may make it worthwhile to maintain the asset.    If we answer no to all 3 questions above, then the asset should be offboarded. There are other cases where an asset should be offboarded even if we can answer yes to one or more of the above tests:  If the asset has been migrated to a new token (eg KNC) If the asset would present unacceptable risk at a total debt exposure of 10 million or greater   Offboarding Actions For assets that MakerDAO chooses to offboard, the following actions will be taken in sequence (subject to governance approval): Stage 1 -  Publicly communicate that the asset will be offboarded Set debt ceiling to 0 DAI Increase stability fee to 5% (if currently less than 5%)  Stage 2 -  Set liquidation penalty to 0% Set liquidation ratio LERP to increase to 500% over 3 months Lower oracle sensitivity to 5%  Stage 3 -  Set liquidation ratio high enough to liquidate all outstanding debt Deactivate oracles for affected collateral type  Change log: 24 August 2021 -  Removed \u201cstability fee increase to 100%\u201d from Month 6 Offboarding Actions  Added context to \u201coffsetting benefits\u201d condition in Choosing Assets to Offboard section  7 September 2021 -  Changed offboarding actions from specifying \u201cmonths\u201d to \u201cstages\u201d Consolidated offboarding actions into fewer steps, and with fewer stability fee increases  ",

Agree 100%. Each step in this process will require being passed in an executive vote, so it won\u2019t be on autopilot in any way.

If there are other paying customers for the feed, we shouldn\u2019t offboard it, just to lose market share to other providers. Which leads me to my next point which is that I believe that there\u2019s more that can be done in terms of selling our Oracle services to external customers to turn unprofitable feeds profitable. Furthermore I think there\u2019s still a lot that can be done in terms of gas optimizations - especially for low use feeds. My view is that if we want our Oracle services to be succesful we should expand the number of feeds, not start cutting our offerings. In a wide product offering, some products will do better than others, but the network effects of having a large \u201cone-stop\u201d Oracle offering in the end cannot be overstated. So I think we need to look at the profitability of the Oracle services as a whole rather than individual feeds. However I do think that we should probably think more carefully about which assets we onboard in the future, to ensure that overall the Oracle services stay profitable. Not entirely sure how this is assessed in the onboarding process of today. Edit: TL;DR - In this stage of the project I think we should focus our attention on growing our userbase and building new profitable feeds, rather than focusing our attention on how to cut costs. ",

Loopring (LRC): the team is using the vault, and also during late Q4, they will launch EthPort, which will provide cheap L2-L1 composability.

I read your reasoning behind offboarding collaterals that generate under 10M DAI due to the oracle\u2019s cost, but MANA is currently generating 4.98M DAI with a debt ceiling of 5M DAI. And the last time the debt ceiling was raised was 2 weeks ago by ~0.5M DAI, and it was maxed out shortly after. With a 3% SF these vaults are generating $150k/y in fees for MakerDAO. Is there anything we can do on our side to keep MANA as collateral? At least to me it feels like we could reach the target of 10M DAI eventually if the debt ceiling was raised. ",

Just a suggestion\u2013and if that is possible you can reach out as Tosh suggested above, to Nadia. As far as \u201cretail\u201d maybe doing more events within Decentraland, featuring DAI? Food for thought. Also, you might want to voice your opinion in this Signal Request. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for your responses @Tosh9.0 @flipflopflapdelegate @rema we are discussing ways to improve the liquidity of MANA on-chain for sure, either via the DAO, the Foundation, or both. The lack of liquidity on DEXes is a problem that goes beyond this issue with Maker for MANA and I personally will try my best to improve it, from what I\u2019ve talked with facilitators from the DAO and the Foundation this is something we all want to see happen so one way or another I\u2019m sure we will get more liquidity. Once that is improved maybe we could discuss raising the debt ceiling? That would then allow Decentraland to maybe open a vault and generate more DAI from it, but with the current utilization at 99% that\u2019s not even an option now. ",
