                    "content": "The objective of this post is to provide context to the spells included executive proposal for June 8th 2022: Starknet DAI bridge limit increase, and authority setting on L1EscrowMom. Bridge limit The Maker governance voted on a DAI 5Mn limit for the simple bridge (link to poll). This is the maximum amount of DAI that can be in the L1 bridge contract. The Starknet Engineering CU (SECU) decided to incrementally increase the bridge limit to monitor any potential issue. The current limit is set at DAI 100k. If the executive proposal passes, the following change will be implemented after calling setCeiling on 0x659a00c33263d9254Fed382dE81349426C795BB6:  The DAI bridge limit will be increased to DAI 200k  Set authority on L1EscrowMom In order to increase the security of the bridge, SECU decided to implement a circuit breaker scheme to allow governance to freeze withdrawals in case an anomaly is detected. The circuit breaker scheme relies on modifying the addresses that own and have authority over the L1 escrow. This is being done via a contract called L1EscrowMom. During the development phase, SECU had control over the L1EscrowMom contract. At deployment of the bridge, the deployer\u2019s rights were revoked and admin control of L1EscrowMom has been transferred to governance. However, governance decisions have a two days delay, which is not acceptable for the circuit breaker by nature of its purpose. Hence, we are transferring the authority to DSChief to be able to activate the circuit breaker in real-time. If the executive proposal passes, the following change will be implemented after setAuthority(0x0a3f6849f78076aefaDf113F5BED87720274dDC0) on 0xc238E3D63DfD677Fa0FA9985576f0945C581A266 is called:  DSChief(0x0a3f6849f78076aefaDf113F5BED87720274dDC0) will control L1EscrowMom(0xc238E3D63DfD677Fa0FA9985576f0945C581A266)  ",

This is a question with a very variable answer. There would be three constraints in getting an emergency executive passed:  Availability of PE to review and write the spell (we could have an emergency spell written and ready to go to reduce this time but we would still need PE available and informed to deploy the spell). Availability of GovAlpha to add the spell to the voting portal and to muster delegates/large MKR holders to vote. Availability of delegates and large MKR holders to cast their votes in order to pass the executive vote, which would also depend on the strength of the hat (how many votes the new executive requires to pass).  So there would be a difference in response time depending on when it occurred - e.g. the response at 12:00 Eastern Time would likely be very different to the response at 03:00 Eastern Time due to the availability of relevant actors for human reasons. Equally, if it occurred over the weekend will likely be different than if it occurred during the week. Bear in mind that once a spell is deployed the code is visible on-chain, unless we utilise the Dark Spell Mechanism, so any observers would know there was an issue with the relevant bridge.
