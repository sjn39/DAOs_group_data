It\u2019s not surprising that other stablecoins like Pax, BUSD and GUSD want this same exposure and would benefit from being added to the PSM. Stablecoins that are on-boarded get an incredible benefit of being direct minters of Dai. For this service, we should consider all the potential benefits the Maker protocol can receive in exchange for adding new stablecoin support, in addition to maintaining the peg. For example, it\u2019s critically important to consider what they add to the total distribution and usability of Dai. In the case of Paxos, the issuer of Pax, being able to have Dai enabled on their platforms api\u2019s and infrastructure, which serves fintechs like Paypal and Revolut, it is clear that they can bring value to Dai by supporting it on their products which ultimately creates more demand for Dai and then more Pax minting of Dai. Looking at the full scope of benefits a stablecoin like Pax can bring, also offsets its current somewhat limited circulating supply. For MakerDAO, including Dai in the Paxos API and infrastructure means directly on-off ramps from USD to DAI (through PAX) and a regulated channel for Dai minting. The difference between USDC and PAX as collateral in the PSM is that Paxos could offer this service for Dai if we can get an agreement with them. Binance and Gemini are similar, and we are in conversations with those teams to find out what they can offer to MakerDAO. Further, there has been active discussions in the community about what collaterals are the most productive and which are costing more by maintaining oracles, performing risk assessments and other operational overhead. We should evaluate stablecoins that are considered for the PSM in the same way, with an emphasis on how they increase the demand for Dai generation and usability. The Growth team is actively discussing how some of the pending stablecoins can bring utility to Dai users by opening up new distribution channels and we\u2019d like to have a few weeks to conclude these discussions before adding these stablecoins to the next on chain vote.     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     If yes wins, we will delay this poll until having a clear understanding of what Paxos (or the others) can offer to MakerDAO to add PAX(or other stablecoin) to the PSM. If no wins, the normal cycle of the poll will continue. We will keep everyone updated with any relevant information we get from Paxos, Binance, or Gemini. Poll ends on Thursday, 1st of July. ",

They argue that these stablecoins can bring value to Dai by supporting it on their products, which ultimately creates more demand for Dai and then more Pax minting of Dai. The author is also asking for feedback through a poll and is willing to delay the governance poll related to adding PAX-GUSD-BUSD to PSM to conclude discussions about how these stablecoins can bring utility to Dai users. A 3rd party gives constructive criticism by suggesting that the author should consider the risks associated with adding more stablecoins to the PSM. Another 3rd party extends to the proposal by suggesting that the author should consider adding USDT to the PSM.",
