The \u201cSee how other token holders delegated\u201d Toggle Button. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only doofus who didn\u2019t immediately see this toggle button when trawling the website and this page. Thus, in the spirit of decentralising delegate voting power: Can we make this toggle button default to being switched \u2018On\u2019? Or just remove the toggle button and make the OP delegations for each delegate permanently viewable as a feature? Hope this can be done. Seems easy enough to do(?). Thanks for your time! ",
