                    "content": "As part of Ethereum 1x efforts, we want to tackle the issue of the growing blockchain state. Large state size leads to long sync times. On top of that, geth\u2019s fast sync is not that fast and takes a few hours. Parity\u2019s warp sync is faster, but is not supported in geth. We propose a new sync protocol and an algorithm, which we believe can perform snapshot sync in less than an hour. The idea is somewhat similar to Warp Sync and especially to Leaf Sync (under development in geth). Moreover, the new protocol caters for clients with a different storage structure than the canonical Patricia trie (e.g. turbo-geth). The new protocol and algorithm are described in a paper. See also my presentation at Ethereum Core Devs Eth1x/Istanbul Planning Meeting in Berlin. This is the first version; comments, suggestions, critique are most welcome. ",
