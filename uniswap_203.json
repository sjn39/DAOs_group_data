                    "content": "Should Uniswap provide Rage Trade with an additional use grant? Snapshot Temp Check Authors: Noodles + Crema + Vertex Related Discussion: Our proposal is similar to Voltz Additional Use Grant  What is Rage Trade? Rage Trade is a new perpetual swap  protocol built using Uniswap v3. Many on-chain perpetuals currently use Uniswap v2 style vAMMs. However, traders and LPs benefit from v3\u2019s concentrated liquidity so we opted to build on v3 to design the most capital efficient perp.  Why do we need an additional use grant? Our proposal is most similar to the proposal by Voltz Protocol. Unlike Voltz we have not forked UNI v3\u2019s code but instead we have built on top of it. Think of Uniswap as our matching engine, and on top we have built a risk engine to enable leverage trading. We have wrapped the following on top of Uniswap\u2019s core: leverage trading, leverage LPing, cross-margin, liquidations, and real time funding rates.  What changes have we made that require additional use? We have built libraries to enable leverage trading, leverage LPing, and real-time funding rates. Each of the libraries below makes use of Uniswap\u2019s BUSL protect code (that we require an additional grants use for):   SimulateSwap: This library is used to simulate a swap on Rage. It makes use of Uniswap\u2019s TickBitMap and SwapMath libraries.  TickBitmapExtended: This library is a slightly modified version of Uniswap\u2019s TickBitmap, required in SimulateSwap for using tick data from UniswapV3Pool contract.  TickExtended: This library is used to enable realtime funding payments on Rage Trade. They borrow from Tick libraries of Uniswap v3.  LiquidityPosition: This library enables leverage liquidity providing (and the accompanying margin logic). It utilises the Uniswap SqrtPriceMath library to do so.   How will approving this proposal benefit Uniswap?   Onchain Perps bring new liquidity to UNI v3: Since we are strictly built on top of UNI v3 (not a fork) all additional TVL + trading volume is strictly additive to UNI v3.   Rage Trade will spend significant R&D resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategie: Rage has already designed a new LP strategy known as the 80-20 strategy that composes with Curve\u2019s tricrypto.   Liquid & composable on-chain perpetuals enable a whole new world of Uniswap spot strategies: Using perps, Uniswap v3 users can mitigate impermanent loss on Uni v3 via delta hedging. Additionally multi-collateral perps open new avenues and payoffs that are currently not possible on the spot market.    Conclusion Rage Trade stands to benefit Uniswap in many ways and strictly adds to Uniswap\u2019s value as a protocol. We look forward to discussing our proposal with the Uniswap community and answering questions in the comments below. ",

We take security very seriously and that is why we only published this proposal once our code had been opensourced + audited!   I\u2019d love to share some our accomplishments in tweet form. We are a deeply research oriented team with a background in mech design and open source contributions. Let me share some of the research pieces we drafted up on perpetual swaps + UNI v3:     0xCrema and I wrote a deep dive thread into GMX (arbitrum\u2019s largest protocol) and opensourced our findings here   We also built a backtesting framework for our UNI v3 LP vault strategies, which we also opensourced   We have also written research threads on other perp protocols such as Perp + Drift. All the accompanying data queries are opensourced and shared in the respective threads.    This is a really great question - omnichain liquidity does not in fact rely on UNI v3 to be deployed on each chain. The way it is designed the protocol can source liquidity from any chain while all the UNI v3 operations execute on Arbitrum. We plan to use Layer Zero (another Uniswap Labs investment) in order to build out our omnichain liquidity system.  ",

In general I\u2019m hugely supportive of v3 being used as a building block for more abstract products and really appreciate how you\u2019ve embraced defi\u2019s composable nature in building Rage Trade. I wanted to add some of my own color to @bryanlehrer\u2019s question about a token grant. While I agree that the case here is less distinct than Voltz forking the protocol and deploying new contracts, and I agree that building a large perps market atop Uniswap is additive from a volume and usage perspective, I still think a grant would be appropriate. It doesn\u2019t have to be huge, and doesn\u2019t have to be now (Voltz doesn\u2019t yet have a token and likely won\u2019t for some time). The monetary value of any particular grant is immaterial to the protocol\u2019s treasury. Instead I think that it\u2019s important that the Uniswap has the option to be a non-negligible voice in the governance of those protocols that are building on top of it. What that participation looks like hasn\u2019t been fully thought out, though I spent some time with the team from Other Internet brainstorming earlier in the year and I think we\u2019ll be able to put together a comprehensive proposal when there are actually tokens with which the protocol (or an elected steward acting on its behalf) could vote. Voltz committed 1% of their token supply. How does 50 bps sound? ",
