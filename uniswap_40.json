This could be run via a Uniswap arts commission, funded by governance. Background on the BMW Art Car for reference: BMW Art Car - Wikipedia (The work should not necessarily supercede whatever artwork is forthcoming from the team.) This could run seasonally, as a yearly one-off exhibition, or on some other timescale. Governance could fund a small, potentially one-time contribution and the forthcoming \u201coriginals\u201d could be auctioned with the proceeds reinvested into the arts commission. If done correctly the project could provide a strong mix of patronage, PR, and community building for negligible costs (and potentially, in the long run, become self-funded). and it would be extremely cool.

I think the idea is extremely scalable in this sense, it functions both in a limited application but also in broader use cases. The pplpleasr v3 video/NFT story shows just how powerfully synergistic these sorts of things can be. ",
