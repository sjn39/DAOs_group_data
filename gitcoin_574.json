                    "content": "This proposal seeks the community\u2019s support for creating 3D versions of each MoonshotBot, and then making the files available as free downloads for MSB holders. 3D renderings can enable the bots to expand further out into the metaverse in new and emergent ways - across virtual worlds, AR/VR integrations, animation, games, 3D printing, and whatever else the community decides to build. This will enhance the visibility and value of MoonshotBots, and thus increase the incentive for new mints, which means more ETH for public goods! Here is the prototype, designed by @TorusMatrix: Password: publicgoods (The copy and layout are placeholder.) https://www.moonshotbots.io/ Thanks to the excellent voxel-based original design work by @thecydonian, we can create these bots in 3D while staying faithful to the 2D versions, and maintain each bot\u2019s uniqueness, including all rarity attributes. To be clear, these 3D versions would not be separate NFTs. They would simply be bonus offerings for MSB holders - or effectively \u2018airdropped\u2019 if you will. Other avatar pfp projects are also moving in the direction of 3D. For example, Meebits by LarvaLabs provides .VOX files for Meebit holders. Bored Ape Yacht Club is working with an agency to do 3D renderings (source). RTFKT Studios is working on a 3D avatar project (source). The user experience proposed for MSB would simply be 1) connect wallet, 2) get immediate access to the 3D download files for any MoonshotBot(s) owned. No gas or minting costs needed. We would make the 3D download files available in the following formats:  Avatar - optimized to be used as a profile picture (square) on Twitter, Discord, OpenSea, etc. Presentation - optimized for digital display frames (16:9) .VOX - for 3D tools like MagicaVoxel and Blender .VOX (t-pose) - optimized for \u2018rigging\u2019 so that it\u2019s easier to animate in tools like Mixamo  There are two options for where we make these download files available to users:   On the minting site (bots.moonshotcollective.space) - This would \u201ckeep everything in one place\u201d, but would require the website maintainers to adjust the design and scripting accordingly.   A new dedicated 3D website (moonshotbots.io) - We are prepared to stand up and maintain a parallel website where people can connect their wallets and get the appropriate files.   This new site would prominently link to the minting page to avoid any confusion. @joshuavial has offered to do the scripting and built a working prototype that confirms we can detect and verify the MSB #s after connecting a wallet. In the future, this site could address frequently asked questions about the 3D files, include helpful tips, etc. We are happy with either of these options. We don\u2019t want to create extra work for others, but understand if it\u2019s preferred to keep the 3D downloads on the minting site for simplicity. What we need to make this happen:   Your support and permission for creating this derivative work. We are excited about the idea, but only if you are too! We\u2019re not sure exactly what IP restrictions may or may not apply, but all of our 3D work would be published in the spirit of open source and be gifted to the Moonshot Collective.   Access to the original artwork. We can see the completed PNG files, but it would be best if we could use the original Illustrator files, to ensure accuracy, speed, and quality.   We are not seeking any funds for this proposal. We have a clear process defined for transforming each bot into 3D, per the prototypes above. If we move forward, we will enroll help from an additional 3D designer so that Torus doesn\u2019t get carpal tunnel. We\u2019re open to referrals or anyone in this community who is interested in jumping in. The design decisions would also need to be \u201clocked\u201d before we embark on the process of converting all 303 bots into 3D. So any feedback on the prototypes is valuable at this stage, assuming we move forward. We estimate it would take approximately 8 weeks to have everything ready for production. To recap, we are looking for support to create 3D renderings of all 303 MoonshotBots and make the download files freely available to MSB holders. The potential benefits of this endeavor will be to enhance the value of MSBs and open up new creative possibilities, which feeds back into demand for the bots. Increased demand = more ETH for public goods. The potential drawbacks of this project are user confusion about the link between the 2D NFTs and the 3D files, and the opportunity costs involved with dedicating energy to this. Thanks for your time and consideration in reading this proposal. Let\u2019s coordinate for public goods and launch MoonshotBots to the next level!
