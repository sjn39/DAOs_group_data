                    "content": "Parameter Proposal Group: MakerDAO Open Market Committee  Authors: @Primoz @LongForWisdom, @Monet-supply, @SebVentures, @Akiva, @hexonaut, @ultraschuppi  Source: Risk Premiums & Competitive Rates November 2021  Table Notes:  Risk premiums and maximum debt ceilings assume liquidations 2.0 and are calculated based on recent market conditions Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards and Compound and Aave, as well as interest and rewards earned on deposited collateral Lending products are not standardized across defi and cefi lenders, and therefore rates can not be strictly compared on a like for like basis   Lending Market Overview Rates at Cefi lending platforms remain stable from last month. Among Defi lenders, rates have trended upwards over the month, and average borrowing costs on ETH and WBTC are both roughly 1% higher.  Aave has seen much higher rate volatility relative to Compound, with somewhat higher borrowing rates on large cap collateral assets overall; the above chart shows net borrowing costs on stablecoins against ETH collateral at each platform. This could be accounted for by a different structure for rewards (with much higher rewards going to USDC versus DAI), or a wider variety of assets available as collateral on Aave. We\u2019ve also seen USDC rates remain higher on both platforms relative to DAI, which may be responsible for some of the PSM-USDC-A outflow over the past weeks. On Compound, borrowing rates have averaged around 2% higher over the past month, with some notable USDC borrow rate spikes that were not witnessed in DAI. Abracadabra (platform of the MIM collateralized stablecoin) has also seen significant growth in the past month. The chart shows the collective debt ceilings of the MIM platform, with the vast majority being actively borrowed. This has been led by huge increase in the price of the platform\u2019s reward token, which has been driven by origination fees charged for newly minted MIM creating a flywheel effect. It\u2019s unclear if this growth is sustainable in the medium term but worth looking out for. Abracadabra\u2019s list of available collateral could also help show which potential new assets are most popular with the market.  1118\u00d7672 47.1 KB   Proposed Changes  ETH-A: Increase SF from 2.0% to 2.5%  ETH price increased by about 40% this month alone, which drove the demand for DAI minting. DAI from ETH-A increased by 670 MM or by 40% in October, which coincided with the price increase. It is hard to tell how much additional organic demand Maker was able to attract, as the majority of DAI minting was probably mostly related to the price increase. Largest ETH-A borrower (Nexo) minted around 476 MM and a large part of the demand was driven by a few whales alone. Maker was also able to retain its market share and top position in ETH locked between 3 largest lending platforms. Because of the market rates increase and bullish sentiment surrounding ETH lately, we are proposing an increase in SF from 2.0% to 2.5%. The best competitive rate at Compound would still be above the proposed rate (2.8%).   ETH-B: Increase SF from 5.0% to 6.0%  ETH-B debt exposure increased by 56 MM or 95% in October, which is 2x of the collateral price increase and confirms an uptick in organic demand. The runup in ETH price potentially attracted more leverage seeking users. We are proposing a rate increase of 1% for ETH-B in order to catch-up on market rate increases and compensate for the higher risk premium. Note that the 30% risk premium calculated is due to the large number of new users that the risk model treats as unsafe because they haven\u2019t been tested in a market crash scenario.  We also believe the ETH-B users are less sensitive to such changes. The competitive rates would be lower though, but we believe the combination of OSM delay and low LR ETH-B vaults makes this vault very attractive and unique.  ETH-C: No changes  ETH-C debt exposure increased by 154 MM in October and is at an all-time high. This vault, despite having a high liquidation requirement of 170%, is very attractive for its 0.5% SF as it gets hard to find such a good deal across established lending platforms. We don\u2019t propose any rate changes for ETH-C, since this vault is in our opinion mainly meant to stimulate new DAI minting. Furthermore, the risk premium of this vault is very low.  WBTC-A: Increase SF from 2.0 to 2.5%  DAI debt from WBTC-A is at ATH and closing at 750 MM, which is is the current line. We reacted to this 2 weeks ago by suggesting to adjust DC-IAM parameters. The demand we are witnessing this month has to do with the BTC price increase of 42%, but the debt exposure changed by almost 450 MM, confirming there was an increase in demand from new users. We managed to identify a few users that have migrated from Aave due to better (potentially also more predictable) rate at Maker. Below you can see that Maker finally started to fill the gap in BTC locked when compared between three largest DeFi lending venues.  Because of the huge demand seen lately and increase in market rates, we are proposing a marginal increase in SF of 0.5%. Rate of 2.5% would be at par compared to Aave and Compound. Also note that there is a process of releasing a low LR WBTC-B vault soon.  LINK-A: Increase SF from 1.0% to 1.5%  There was a bit of uptick in demand lately, competitive rates are in line and we believe that 0.5% rate increase is justified.  YFI-A: No chances (1.0% SF)  No changes are proposed. There was a desire to increase rates, but competitive rates are in some cases negative and we don\u2019t want to drive the demand away.  UNI-A: No changes (1.0% SF)  No changes are proposed. There was a desire to increase rates, but competitive rates are in some cases negative and we don\u2019t want to drive the demand away.  MANA-A SF: Increase DC from 5 MM to 10 MM  Governance decided not to offboard the MANA-A vault as the vault type got fully utilized. The current 5 MM debt ceiling was in line with the risk model in the past, but high median collateralization of current vaults of 520% does suggest we can increase the debt ceiling for another 5m. Therefore, a DC increase to 10 MM is proposed. Another increase may follow later, depending on the collateralization of vaults, but Risk suggests caution since MANA on-chain liquidity isn\u2019t very high (30% slippage on $3 MM MANA sold).  RENBTC-A: Increase SF from 2.0% to 2.5%  Increasing rates to match WBTC-A.  MATIC-A: Increase DC from 10 MM to 20 MM and increase gap from 3 MM to 20 MM  The Polygon team deposited $55 MM worth of MATIC collateral into the MATIC-A vault yesterday and minted 3 MM of DAI. We believe they are willing to mint more DAI and we therefore propose to increase the debt ceiling to 20 MM, which is in line with risk models. We believe the vault will still reach healthy collateralization at full DC utilization (expecting more than 265% if the full amount of 20 MM DAI is borrowed). At the same time we are also proposing to increase the gap to 20 MM, so that the Polygon team doesn\u2019t have to make too many iterative mints because of DC-IAM limits. However, Risk proposed to decrease the gap back to the 3 MM range as soon as the debt is utilized. In the case MATIC is proposed to be offboarded, the Risk Core Unit will propose separate parameters to offboard MATIC-A.  USDC-A, TUSD-A, PAX-A, GUSD-A We are proposing 1% SF for USDC-A. The idea is to make users with a collateralization ratio above 101% unwind. If they won\u2019t, Maker is able to collect additional fees. The downside of this approach is that a certain amount of vaults\u2019 debt (around 200 MM) will go underwater, meaning Maker would accrue interests that it would later need to write-off (while sweeping vaults over to PSM-USDC-A). But the amount shouldn\u2019t be too large (2 MM linearly per year), plus we believe the liquidation into PSM-USDC-A could happen within months.  UNIV2WBTCETH-A  The debt is close to fully utilized and we are proposing to increase DC to 30 MM, raise gap to 5 MM and increase SF to 2.5% to match ETH-A and WBTC-A.  Final Note The proposed changes, if confirmed, should increase yearly revenue by about 20 MM or from 73 MM to 93 MM DAI. Most of the changes are reaction to increased rates in DeFi and CeFi, bullish market sentiment and huge DAI minting amounts observed at ETH and WBTC vaults. Proposed SFs will get included into next week\u2019s on-chain poll on 2021-10-31T23:00:00Z, and if passed, will be included in an executive vote on 2021-11-04T23:00:00Z. ",

I really want to urge people to turn down the proposal to remove MATIC from out collateral list.   My growth proposal is going to want to not just expand the MATIC vault but also to include a MATIC-DAI v2 vault.   I know the V2 vaults have not gotten much traction in terms of borrow.   My growth proposal is going to show us a clear way to expand those. Other point.  I keep thinking we need to lighten up on the wBTC rate increases - mostly because one of the things I want to focus on is these Token-DAI v2 vaults.   I wonder if we could just do a 25bps raise on the wBTC and wBTCDAI v2 for now instead of the 50bps to send a small signal Maker does want more wBTC here. Later on we can re-evaluate going higher on those. Even so I intend to support this proposal. Otherwise great job and thank you for putting in the effective borrow rates using the farming data!!  So appreciated as I will be referencing this for the DAI growth proposal I am working on. ",

It is very good to know that WBTC locked in Maker is closing the gap as compared to competitors, I also see WBTC locked increased quite a lot after the new debt ceiling increased from 750M to 1.5B. But there is a possibility that 1.5B is going to hit soon if there is a parabolic run, and it is really painful to see that 1.5B is the limit in that case. Even so when WBTC locked is already closing the gap compared to Compound and Aave. I certainly will be very happy to see Maker leads in WBCT locked.  Maybe 3B? ",

                    "content": "Parameter Proposal Group: MakerDAO Open Market Committee Authors: @Primoz @LongForWisdom @monet-supply @SebVentures @hexonaut @ultraschuppi  Source: Risk Premiums & Competitive Rates - Updates for February 2022 - Google Sheets  Lending Market Overview Competitive Rates in DeFi have been pretty stable until last week\u2019s crash but have dropped significantly since then as borrowers deleverage their debt positions to protect against getting liquidated or reduce their long exposure in anticipation of bearish market sentiment.  Similarly funding rates on Centralized exchanges fell and are holding close to 2 years lows at 3.07% currently on Binance.  Chart1200\u00d7742 31.3 KB   Proposed Changes Aside to the changes on the overall Lending Market there has also been a huge DAI supply through the USDC-PSM pushing the stablecoin ratio from ~50% to ~62% and we therefore propose to lower the rates across the board for non-stable-assets and LP-vault-types to stimulate DAI minting.   ETH-A  decrease Stability Fee by 0.25% from 2.50% to 2.25%   We are proposing just a small decrease here as we aim for low rates volatility for our flagship products ETH-A and WBTC-A.  WBTC-A  decrease Stability Fee by 0.25% from 4.00% to 3.75%   We are proposing just a small decrease here as we aim for low rates volatility for our flagship products ETH-A and WBTC-A.  ETH-B  decrease Stability Fee by 2.50% from 6.50% to 4.00%   Utilization is down from 150 MM to 65 MM - we assume this gets some traction with some more competitive rate. The overall sentiment is not too much in favor of borrowing (hence the increase of the stablecoin ratio) - but users of this vault-type are more likely to be pro-borrowing. Liquidations of last weekend showed again the system is robust and we believe this could be a key factor for driving up the DAI-supply. Please note that we want to maintain a higher spread between -B and -A types in the long run - so we will likely increase rates here as soon as the market sentiment changes again.  WBTC-B  decrease Stability Fee by 2.00% from 7.00% to 5.00%   Same reasons as for ETH-B, but in this case there hasn\u2019t been a huge supply of DAI yet. Nevertheless, the rate on this product is too high to be attractive, we want to change this with this proposed change. Please note that we want to maintain a higher spread between -B and -A types in the long run - so we will likely increase rates here as soon as the market sentiment changes again.  WBTC-C  decrease Stability Fee by 0.75% from 1.50% to 0.75%   This vault-type hasn\u2019t see a real adoption yet. As it is the most safe option for the protocol, we would like to bring the rates down to comparable levels with ETH-C to encourage utilization.  AAVE-D3M  decrease Target Borrow Rate (bar) by 0.25% from 3.75% to 3.50%   The changes on the ETH-A SF allow for a little decrease on the Target Borrow Rate which will push another ~100 MM of DAI into Aave. We are still within the guidance the community gave us (Debt Ceiling Target, Net Rates Spread). The community should think about the guidance for the Debt Ceiling Target mid-term, as further actions on the D3M are not going to be effective with the current guidance.   WSTETH-A  decrease Stability Fee by 0.50% from 3.00% to 2.50%   Currently the main place to put stETH at work is the steth pool on Curve which contains $1.4B of stETH. Yields have come down there to around 5%. A WSETH-A facility at 2.5% is expected to attract some usage either for leverage or stablecoin yield farming. They would earn the Eth2.0 yield (4.7% APR currently) on 100% of the collateral (vs 50% on Curve) plus being able to borrow cheaply and use borrowed DAI to farm (for instance on GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A).   GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A  decrease Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) from 500 MM to 100 MM    The volume on the 0.05% Uni-V3 pool has been on the decline for some weeks, the 0.01% pool is continuing to take over. Since the utilization is now well below 100 MM we propose to decrease the line as well.  GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A  decrease Stability Fee by 0.25% from 0.50% to 0.25% increase Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) from 500 MM to 750 MM increase Target Available Debt (gap) from 10 MM to 50 MM    The 0.01% pool continues to take over the volume, the last increase on the line has been adopted by the users. We propose to bring the configuration closer to the 0.05%-vault-type by decreasing the Stability Fee again and increasing the parameters for utilization (line and gap)  UniV2-Vault-Types This is another attempt to stimulate usage of these vault-types - if this is not picking up the community should consider offboarding them as we are not even covering the oracle costs.  UNIV2DAIETH-A  decrease Stability Fee by 1.00% from 2.00% to 1.00%    UNIV2WBTCETH-A  decrease Stability Fee by 1.00% from 3.00% to 2.00%    UNIV2USDCETH-A  decrease Stability Fee by 1.00% from 2.50% to 1.50%    TUSD-A  decrease Stability Fee by 1.00% from 1.00% to 0.00%   Aside from 3 dust-vaults, all vaults are already undercollateralized so all further income generated by the Stability Fee is going to get negated once they get liquidated.  Revenue Effects We anticipate the effect on annualized revenue - assuming stable levels of utilization - to be  -5.0 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on ETH-A -2.4 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on WBTC-A -1.0 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on ETH-B -0.0 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on WBTC-B -0.0 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on WBTC-C +2.5 MM by the Target Borrow Rate decrease on AAVE-D3M -0.2 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on WSTETH-A -0.1 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A -0.0 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on UNIV2DAIETH-A -0.0 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on UNIV2WBTCETH-A -0.1 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on UNIV2USDCETH-A -0.3 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on TUSD-A (note: is already undercollateralized and will be negated as soon the vaults are liquidated)   Final Note The proposed changes, if confirmed, should decrease yearly revenue by about 6.7 MM DAI. Proposed changes will get included into the on-chain poll on 2022-01-30T23:00:00Z, and if passed, will be included in an executive vote on 2022-02-03T23:00:00Z. ",

Lowering rates was more of a defensive move to avoid losing customers for other platforms and get rates in line with the competition. The Nexo vault will soon come into effect and it will be a major drop in revenues for us. All in all, there is little MOMC can do here. GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A can help reducing USDC exposure and the reasoning is that decreasing SF doesn\u2019t change the revenues (as exposure grows in the same order of magnitude). It also increases DAI outstanding a bit artificially. But this doesn\u2019t achieve much all things considered. What gets me excited is stETH.

Aave has recently decreased farming rewards by 30% but we don\u2019t expect this to affect DAI rates significantly as the reward distribution between supplied and borrowed DAI changed from 50:50 ratio to 33:66. While rates at two largest Maker competitors are on average in line with current ETH-A rate, note that the rate volatility on these secondary lenders platforms is very high, implying that additional larger borrow amounts could not be sustained at these low rates at Aave and Compound as easily. This was also one of the main reasons why we thought a smaller increase in ETH-A rate should be sustained by the large borrowers. According to the last study performed, most of the recent debt increase on ETH-A was performed by two entities who represent already two thirds of ETH-A debt exposure.  Source: MakerDAO Risk Dashboard | Block Analitica  Risk Overview Risk premiums have remained at similar levels over the last months, except for some smaller assets that have seen outflow of liquidity from Sushiswap lately - TVL dropped by more than 1bn in the last 2 weeks, potentially due to different allocation of Sushi liquidity mining rewards. Assets that are being affected are mostly tokens that are currently being offboarded at Maker. YFI liquidity dropped significantly on Sushiswap, but 25m out of 31m YFI-A debt is represented by Yearn treasury and YFI vault strategy, which is normally treated as a safe and well managed position. WBTC vaults still present a threat at current exposure due to potentially long WBTC redemption cycle issues, but after knowing the largest two borrowers are two large and well capitalized centralized lenders, we feel a bit more relaxed about the state of WBTC vault risk. Additionally the upcoming safer and cheaper WBTC-C vault should offload some of these risks. The calculated ETH-B risk premium is an outlier currently and has a high value because of the large amount of recently newly opened vaults that the risk model by default treats as medium or high risk, since we don\u2019t have any behavioural inputs to use.  Proposed Changes  ETH-A  increase Stability Fee by 0.25% from 2.5% to 2.75%   Competitive rates have decreased slightly in the last month. The proposed rate of 2.75% will remain below the competitive rates but bring us closer to them. This continues our policy of proposing small rate changes where possible.  ETH-B  increase Stability Fee by 0.5% from 6.0% to 6.5%   Similar adjustment like with ETH-A. ETH-B users are traditionally less sensitive to rate changes so we propose a bigger increase of the Stability Fee here.  WBTC-A  increase Maximum Debt Ceiling by 500 MM from 1500 MM to 2000 MM increase Target Available Debt by 20 MM from 60 MM to 80 MM   The DAI-minting from WBTC-A has slowed down in the last week, maybe also related to the Mid-month rates increase. The primary driver for the accelerated DAI-minting has been identified - Celsius - so we feel a lot more confident now with WBTC in general which is why we propose changing line and gap to allow more DAI from this vault type.  LINK-A  increase Stability Fee by 1.0% from 1.5% to 2.5%   We have been keeping the rates for LINK-A artificially low to stimulate DAI-minting. Within the last 6 weeks ~25 MM new DAI have been minted so we think it is time to bring this to a level we have for other similar collateral types.  MANA-A  increase Stability Fee by 3.0% from 3.0% to 6.0%   With the currently set Stability Fee MANA-A is not a profitable product. We propose to increase the Stability Fee with the target to breakeven with the oracle costs. If this product starts working again, we can decrease the fees again later - if it doesn\u2019t the community should think about offboarding it like we already did with a couple of other collateral types.  UNI-A  increase Stability Fee by 2.0% from 1.0% to 3.0%   Similar situation as with MANA-A - the rates are artificially low but the intended effect of increased DAI minting is not happening. We applied a similar growth strategy here as we did with LINK-A, but in this case it did not work out. The proposed changes will barely cover the oracle costs.  GUSD-A  increase Stability Fee by 1.0% from 0.0% to 1.0%   The GUSD-PSM is going to launch soon. As a first step we propose to increase the Stability Fee slightly with the goal to increase motivation to unwind here and move over to PSM.  GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A  decrease Stability Fee by 0.4% from 0.5% to 0.1%   The APR on this pool has decreased significantly so the DAI-minting has slowed down a lot. This is related to the new 0.01% UniV3-pool which already has a much higher volume than the underlying 0.05% pool of this collateral. With the currently set Stability Fee it is not profitable to stay here, we propose to decrease the Stability Fee to reduce the loss for vault users. Note that there is already a Signal Request in the forum for onboarding the corresponding Gelato-Token for the new pool. The proposed changes will decrease our annualized income by ~0.75 MM - we still think this is a reasonable change as the alternative would be that the vaults will unwind.  Uniswap V2-LPs:  UNIV2DAIETH-A - increase Stability Fee by 0.5% from 1.5% to 2.0% UNIV2WBTCETH-A - increase Stability Fee by 0.5% from 2.5% to 3.0% UNIV2USDCETH-A - increase Stability Fee by 0.5% from 2.0% to 2.5% UNIV2UNIETH-A - increase Stability Fee by 2.0% from 2.0% to 4.0%  We propose adjusting the Stability Fees to closer align with the rates we have for the underlying collateral types.  Revenue Effects We anticipate the effect on annualized revenue - assuming stable levels of utilization - to be  ETH-A: increase by ~7.8MM ETH-B: increase by ~0.77 MM LINK-A: increase by ~0.68 MM MANA-A: increase by ~0.16 MM UNI-A: increase by ~0.25 MM GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A: decrease by ~0.75 MM Uniswap V2-LPs combined: increase by ~0.58 MM   Final Note The proposed changes, if confirmed, should increase yearly revenue by about 9.6 MM or from 153.2 MM to 162.8 MM DAI. Proposed changes will get included into next week\u2019s on-chain poll on 2021-11-28T23:00:00Z, and if passed, will be included in an executive vote on 2021-12-02T23:00:00Z. ",

                    "content": "Hello @ultraschuppi, is there anything we can do to keep the MANA-A stability fee at 3%? Back then we spoke that there was a need of at least 10M DAI to be generated from MANA-A vaults to cover the oracle\u2019s costs. Back then the vaults were at 100% utilization but the ceiling couldn\u2019t be raised because there were concerns around the liquidity of MANA on-chain (it was around ~$3M). Since then the Decentraland Foundation has provided $10M in MANA/DAI liquidity, and also the token appreciated so now the liquidity has multiplied a bunch of times. The max debt ceiling has been raised to 10M DAI, and the temp debt ceiling is rising every few weeks and it gets quickly filled (we are at ATH currently). And the Decentraland Foundation is not even using the vaults yet to generate DAI using some of its treasury (they are in the process of setting up the multisigs and operation aspects but they will soon), so I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll reach the 10M target that we discussed a few months ago, and the DAI generated by the Foundation will be used to provide liquidity (so the debt ceiling could go higher?). I hope we can reach some middle ground, we\u2019ve been committed to what we discussed a few months back on improving the liquidity of the token and the utilization of the vaults to make the product sustainable.

MANA looks good thanks to the increase in its price, but the Vault remains unprofitable for Maker due to Vault costs (unfortunately, this changes all the time as gas fees are not predictable). For reducing the SF there are some key points:  At first, the MANA Vault will have to get filled to the 10M DC. This means to fill the Vault cap like 3-4 times since the increased limit for MANA Vault is 1m/8h. We know it is inefficient, but this would likely change if MANA continues its trending. After the Vault reaches the 10M cap, and the Collat. Ratio of the Vault remains as healthy as it is, the SF will likely decrease to a 3-4% level by the end of the month, and even the DC could potentially increase. Increasing more MANA liquidity will allow Maker to increase the DC with fewer risks.  I also recommend being on the Maker Discord, so there you can have a fluid conversation with the teams and be there aware of the changes inside the protocol. ",

USDC rates seem to have fallen more than comparable DAI lending rates on defi platforms. Markets remain vulnerable to tightening US central bank monetary policy and geopolitical tensions, with potential changes in rate conditions weighted to the downside.   Proposed Changes  WSTETH-A: Increase debt ceiling to 300M and gap to 30M  1600\u00d7741 117 KB  WSTETH-A vault type has seen strong growth in usage and debt volumes over the past month. These 50% increases in debt ceiling and gap will allow Maker to meet growing demand and cement our position as a leading defi platform for liquid staking tokens.  DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI: Reduce bar to 2.85%, increase debt ceiling to 300M, and increase gap to 65M  1600\u00d7742 141 KB  The community has approved general guidelines for setting Aave D3M parameters; effective borrowing costs should not be more than 0.5% below corresponding Maker stability fees (benchmarked to ETH-A), and Maker should make up no more than 30% of real (non-recursive) DAI supplied to Aave. We estimate roughly 600M of real DAI supply on Aave excluding Maker\u2019s deposits, allowing for up to 300M in Maker D3M exposure before reaching the 30% of supply limit. The debt ceiling has been raised to reflect this, with the gap also increased proportionally to 65M. Setting bar (target borrow rate) to 2.85% results in an effective ETH collateralized borrowing cost of roughly ~1.75% on Aave, which is within the 0.5% threshold of the ETH-A stability fee. This change is expected to lead to full or nearly full utilization of the D3M debt ceiling, which should drive a roughly 3M increase in annualized protocol revenue despite a marginal decrease in deposit rate earned.  Notes:  Risk premiums and maximum debt ceilings are calculated based on recent market conditions Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards on Compound and Aave, as well as interest and rewards earned on deposited collateral Lending products are not standardized across defi and cefi lenders, and therefore rates can not be strictly compared on a like for like basis  The proposed changes, if confirmed, should increase yearly revenue by about 3m, due to increase in expected debt exposure to the Aave D3M (which more than offsets reduction in deposit rate). We are not recommending any other rate or parameter changes at this time, but may submit a mid-month proposal depending on how market conditions develop. Proposed changes will be submitted for on chain voting next week. ",

Today, we even reached the temporary cap for ETH-A and WBTC-A so new DAI can only get minted as soon as the ttl is over. To keep up with the demand, we propose some changes on the DC-IAM parameters for those vault-types as a mid-month parameter proposal as outlined in MIP46. There are also some Signal Requests (here, here) running in the forum indicating that the community is willing to support this change.  Proposed Changes  ETH-A   increase gap from 100 MM to 150 MM decrease ttl from 8h to 6h  The line for ETH-A is already set to 15B which should be enough. The new settings will increase the DAI (ideally) mintable from 300 MM to 600 MM within 24h.  ETH-B   increase line from 300 MM to 500 MM (source) increase gap from 10 MM to 20 MM decrease ttl from 8h to 6h  The new settings will increase the DAI (ideally) mintable from 30 MM to 80 MM within 24h.  WBTC-A   increase line from 750 MM to 1500 MM increase gap from 30 MM to 60 MM decrease ttl from 8h to 6h  The new settings will increase the DAI (ideally) mintable from 120 MM to 240 MM within 24h.  Final Note Proposed changes will get included into the next available on-chain poll and if passed will be included in the following executive vote. ",

Where possible, Parameter Proposals should be made public on the first Monday of the month for inclusion into the weekly cycle in the second week of the month.   Usually - as described in MIP46c3 - there should be a week between a proposal being made in the forum and the proposal being voted on onchain. As one might think that the changes presented here are not doing a real damage (like cutting the revenue by >20% as we had in the June Proposal  - some might remember the turmoil we had after it since it got onchain a bit too fast) I would like to test the water if the proposed next step by @prose11 here is acceptable or not     prose11:  Given that we\u2019re able to have this announcement up over the weekend and relatively low protocol impact of the recommended changes we will have this proposal up for polling on Monday, October 18th assuming the poll passes.    When shall we have this proposal up for an onchain poll?     2021-10-18 - next monday - the fast forward option 2021-10-25 - one week later - the MIP46 prefered option Abstain     0 voters     please also feel free to express your support or disagreement for the whole proposal or the fast-forward option in this thread. cheers tim PS: if you are asking for changes on the SFs or something - sorry, not in this proposal. We decided to focus on the bleeding (no DAI mintable on major ilks) and not get distracted by profit maximizing or something else. MOMC will meet in 2 weeks and will have a deeper look at competitors and other factors. This was really some kind of adhoc proposal set up in a few hours with people in multiple timezones. I hope you still like it. ",

                    "content": "I wanted to share some notes on risk considerations for changing DC-IAM parameters. TL;DR: I believe risks remain low after these proposed updates.  Undercollateralized Minting Risk If the price of an asset falls sharply within the one hour oracle security module (OSM) delay period, it\u2019s possible for Maker to experienced undercollateralized minting - the system allows users to borrow DAI with insufficient collateral due to delayed oracle price. Increasing the GAP parameter allows for additional minting and better user experience, but also increases our maximum losses from this risk. Charts below show potential MakerDAO losses from unbacked minting based on the severity of the intra-hour drawdown. Unless an intra-hour drawdown is extremely severe (over 30%), only the ETH-B vault type would be at risk from undercollateralized minting. This suggests that ETH-B possess the highest risk from increases in gap parameter and may benefit instead from lower ttl (cooldown), which allows for a similar increase in daily debt exposure while maintaining lower risk during rapid price crashes. Current DC-IAM parameters:  Proposed DC-IAM parameters:  Net impact of parameter changes:   Debt Exposure Growth The figure below shows metrics for how quickly debt exposure could grow for covered assets, before and after these proposed parameter changes.  image889\u00d779 6.45 KB  The Days to LINE parameter shows the number of days it would take for debt exposure to hit the LINE (maximum debt ceiling) parameter. Assuming Maker is willing to take on greater exposure to collateral assets, we should ensure that Days to LINE is at least equal or greater than the current governance security module (GSM) delay - this allows governance to react by increasing LINE parameter without business interruption. Growth in GSM shows the maximum amount that DAI debt could increase during the current length of GSM delay. This could be relevant if governance wanted to either increase or reduce exposure to a given collateral asset on short notice. Data is in a google sheet here: DC-IAM Parameter Risk Management - Google Sheets ",

We are probably going to hit the Maximum Debt Ceiling of WBTC-A of 1.5 B DAI (increased in the last Mid-Month Proposal) in a few days. This debt-exposure is reaching an unhealthy state so we propose a few changes to slow down a bit.  Risk Overview @Risk-Core-Unit suggests the increase of risk compensation for WBTC vaults for a few important reasons:  Despite WBTC-DAI on-chain liquidity not being as bad, it is still about 3x worse than ETH-DAI liquidity. What concerns us is the fact that about 50% of existing WBTC is used for leverage across three largest DeFi lending platforms. In a price shock scenario, additional WBTC liquidity might potentially need to be sourced by market makers, which would need to rely on a longer than expected redemption cycle. This potentially means WBTC peg could temporarily break, which creates additional issues for Maker which still uses BTC/USD price oracles instead of WBTC/USD price pair.   Source: MakerDAO Risk Dashboard | Block Analitica  Loan concentration at WBTC-A vault type is one of the highest as three largest borrowers represent two thirds of the exposure. Further, collateralization ratios of WBTC-A vaults are among lowest compared to other Maker vault types, creating additional liquidation risks.   Source: MakerDAO Risk Dashboard | Block Analitica  Maker also became the largest holder of WBTC, surpassing Aave and Compound. As much as this sounds promising, it means Maker carries the largest liquidity risk. Especially since Maker would be the last in line to liquidate WBTC in a price shock scenario (because of the 1h OSM delay) and other platforms could potentially already drain a large part of available WBTC on-chain liquidity.   Source: MakerDAO Risk Dashboard | Block Analitica We also believe that a good way to partially mitigate this would be to introduce a higher LR WBTC-C vault, instead of limiting DC on WBTC-A and forcing users to use riskier WBTC-B type.  Proposed Changes  WBTC-A: Increase SF from 2.5 to 4.0%  WBTC-B: Increase SF from 5.0% to 7.0%  Final Note The proposed changes, if confirmed, should increase yearly revenue ceteris paribus by about 18 MM or from 132 MM to 150 MM DAI. Proposed changes will get included into next week\u2019s on-chain poll on 2021-11-14T23:00:00Z, and if passed, will be included in an executive vote on 2021-11-18T23:00:00Z . ",

                    "content": "Parameter Proposal Group: MakerDAO Open Market Committee Authors: @Primoz @LongForWisdom @monet-supply @SebVentures @hexonaut @ultraschuppi  Source: Risk Premiums & Competitive Rates January 2022  Proposed Changes  ETH-A  decrease Stability Fee by 0.25% from 2.75% to 2.50%   We have seen a disproportionate decrease in DAI-from-ETH-A compared to DAI from PSMs in the last weeks and believe we are going to see lower rates on ETH across all competitors in the near future. To stimulate DAI minting from ETH-A we propose to lower the rates a bit. This will allow us to lower the Target Borrow Rate on AAVE-D3M as well.  AAVE D3M According to the onchain polls about Net Rates Spread and Debt Ceiling Targeting we propose to set  the Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) from 100 MM to 220 MM Target Available Debt (gap) from 15 MM to 50 MM the Target Borrow Rate (bar) by 0.15% from 3.9% to 3.75%    To understand the proposed parameters it seems reasonable to explain how we get to them  Maximum Debt Ceiling According to the onchain poll the community gave us guidance to target for 30% of the real DAI supply on AAVE. According to this dashboard the current real supply is at 728 MM DAI  This results in 218.4 MM DAI - we decided to round this up.  Target Borrow Rate According to the onchain poll the community gave us guidance to target for a spread of -0.5% between the Aave borrowing market and Stability Fee of ETH-A. The Target Borrow Rate bar can be described as Bar = ETH-A Rate (Maker) + Borrow Rewards (Aave on DAI) + 2x Supply Rewards (Aave On ETH) + Spread which is Bar = 2.5% + 1.1% + 2x 0.33% - 0.5% = 3.76% We expect borrowing rewards to move down a bit in the next days, putting 3.7% to a reasonable value for the bar.  Effects of the proposed parameters This change will push another ~75MM of DAI into the secondary market of AAVE lowering the borrow rate of DAI below the corresponding rate on USDC. In total, this will be ~100 MM DAI provided by the Maker Protocol to Aave. With a line of 220 MM we have some headroom left in case borrowing demand increases. This change will allow us to see if it is possible to get market share from the Aave USDC facility. People that engage in recursive yield farming might deposit in USDC but borrow in DAI (instead of depositing and borrowing in USDC). Thanks to the PSM with 0 fees, this doesn\u2019t introduce slippage.  WSTETH-A  decrease Stability Fee by 1.0% from 4.00% to 3.00%   This follows the change we propose on ETH-A and to further grow usage on this vault-type.  LINK-A  decrease Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) by 40 MM from 140MM to 100 MM   Liquidity for LINK has significantly decreased in the last weeks, putting the Modeled Debt Ceiling to 99 MM. As the current utilization is below 80 MM we think it is safe to lower the line to 100 MM.  YFI-A  decrease Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) by 80 MM from 130 MM to 50 MM   Same situation as with LINK - the liquidity for YFI has decreased and with that lowering the Modeled Debt Ceiling to 32 MM. As the protocol might use this vault-type we propose to leave some headroom. With a utilization of ~25 MM there should be enough space left.  UNI-A  decrease Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) by 25 MM from 50 MM to 25 MM   Liquidity for UNI has decreased as well, lowering the Modeled Debt Ceiling to 4.9 MM. We don\u2019t expect too much further traction on this vault-type so halving the line seems reasonable for us.  UNIV2UNIETH-A  decrease Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) by 15 MM from 20 MM to 5 MM   Utilization on this vault-type is almost dried out, similar to UNI-A we thing cutting the line makes sense here. The community might start thinking about offboarding this vault-type as it will probably not be profitable anymore.  GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A  increase Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) by 490 MM from 10 MM to 500 MM decrease Stability Fee by 0.5% from 1.0% to 0.5%   The 0.01% pool on DAI-USDC on Uniswap v3 has taken most of the volume from its older sibling; the vault-type is maxed and we propose to anticipate this change in our parameter configuration putting it to the same configuration as the 0.05% type.  GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A  The 0.05% pool on DAI-USDC on Uniswap v3 has dried out, most of the volume is now on the corresponding 0.01% pool. We thought about lowering the line but decided not to propose this - there is no downside for the protocol of keeping it on the same level and we can also wait to let the market sort this out naturally.  GUSD-A  decrease Debt Ceiling by 5 MM from 5 MM to 0 MM   The GUSD-PSM has been launched so there is no need to keep this vault-type anymore. We started offboarding GUSD-A in the November Proposal and propose to continue here.  Revenue Effects We anticipate the effect on annualized revenue - assuming stable levels of utilization - to be  -6.9MM by the Stability Fee decrease on ETH-A -0.5MM by the Stability Fee decrease on WSTETH-A +2.0 MM by the parameter changes on AAVE-D3M   Final Note The proposed changes, if confirmed, should decrease yearly revenue by about 5.4 MM DAI. Proposed changes will get included into the on-chain poll on 2022-01-16T23:00:00Z, and if passed, will be included in an executive vote on 2022-01-20T23:00:00Z. ",

                    "content": "Sure. The bar is the target borrow rate of D3M and the recent on-chain poll ended with a proposed -0.5% spread between Aave DAI borrow rate (incl. rewards) and ETH-A rate. Meaning community wanted borrowing DAI at Aave shouldn\u2019t more than 0.5% cheaper than at Maker. The Aave DAI borrow rate is a bit trickier to calculate. It\u2019s the one you see on UI (3.9%) minus the 1.05% AAVE rewards on DAI borrowed. So DAI net rate is 2.85% right now. But in order to compare it with Maker, you need to assume a borrower at Aave is also depositing ETH - on which you get another 0.7% of AAVE rewards if you assume the collateralization is 200% which we set as default to make things easier (hence 2x on Supply Rewards). This means the net DAI rate at Aave is currently at about 2.15% (3.9% - 1.05% - 0.7%). The spread between current ETH-A rate of 2.75% and 2.15% is -0.6%. Because we proposed to reduce ETH-A by 0.25% and bar by 0.15% the spread becomes the targeted -0.5%. To make this calculation for Aave DAI net rate easier we made a dashboard with competitive metrics you can access here  Screenshot 2022-01-08 at 21.36.221920\u00d7838 55.4 KB      ultraschuppi:  Bar = ETH-A Rate (Maker) + Borrow Rewards (Aave on DAI) + 2x Supply Rewards (Aave On ETH) + Spread   This is then: Bar = 2.5% + 1.05% + 2 x 0.7% -0.5%  = 3.75% There is an interesting dynamic that we talked about in the meeting - if we lower ETH-A and at the same time lower the bar, how much of lost revenues on ETH-A can be offset by additional exposure on D3M because of lower target rate. And how does this behave if we go potentially even lower in the future. Currently with proposed changes about 30% of lost revenues on ETH-A can be offset with lower bar on D3M and keeping competitiveness intact. Going even lower on ETH-A rate and bar this ratio can increase but the problem is that we\u2019ll go beyond the currently tolerated Aave D3M debt ceiling. ",
