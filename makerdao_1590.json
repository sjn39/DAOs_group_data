Discussions of bug reports, both valid and invalid are stored at https://bugs.immunefi.com/  We maintain GitHub - makerdao-is/Forta-Agents    Will the assets produced using MakerDAO funding be made available as public goods for the whole DAO?  Bug reports are shared at the discretion of ISCU. The Forta agents are licensed with GPLv3.  Will appropriate Open Source Software/Creative Commons licenses be applied to the assets produced?  Yes  Will Copyright for those assets be assigned to the Dai Foundation that has as its mandate to safeguard MakerDAO intangible assets?  The bulk of the work for the Forta agents was done by outside contributors. Since the GPL license ensures that the code will remain available for our use, we will not be pursuing copywrite re-assignments.  Will you integrate the Dai Foundation Contributor License Agreement Assistant in your Github repositories?  This would be something that we would do if our CU planned to create substantial artifacts. We currently have no such plans.  Will the source code/material for the assets be made publicly available? How?  The bugs reports will not be made public. The Forta agents are already publically available and will remain so.  Besides the MakerDAO Forum and MakerDAO Discord, which communication channels do your core unit plan to use to communicate on behalf of MakerDAO according to your mandate?  We communicate with Immunefi via Telegram, email, google drive, and the bug tracker.

Which types of tangible and intangible assets will you be producing with the funding received from MakerDAO? Will the assets produced using MakerDAO funding be made available as public goods for the whole DAO? Specifically:  Will appropriate Open Source Software/Creative Commons licenses be applied to the assets produced? Will Copyright for those assets be assigned to the Dai Foundation that has as its mandate to safeguard MakerDAO intangible assets? Will you integrate the Dai Foundation Contributor License Agreement Assistant  in your Github repositories? Will the source code/material for the assets be made publicly available? How?   Besides the MakerDAO Forum and MakerDAO Discord, which communication channels do your core unit plan to use to communicate on behalf of MakerDAO according to your mandate? Will you ensure that relevant publishing/community websites, email and SoMe accounts and associated DNS and ENS domains used for official MakerDAO communication for which you hold Content Management rights are under ownership of Dai Foundation to ensure ultimate Maker Governance control of who is using these channels?

                    "content": "Having looked into this after more detailed feedback, I can confirm that - for the Admin setting up the integration for a repository - the CLA assistant asks for access to things like GitHub gists, and both public and private repositories. This is due to the fact that the actual contributor license agreement text is stored in a Gist and that the integration also is possible to set up for private repositories. That the App is asking liberally for write access is unfortunately due to a limitation in the Github OAuth scopes where currently, you can\u2019t scope source code access to read-only. (Ref: Authorizing OAuth Apps - GitHub Docs ) There is thus nothing we can change on the App side that will make this different. I will note that the App is built from the open source code available at GitHub - daifoundation/cla-assistant: Contributor License Agreement assistant (CLA assistant) forked from https://github.com/cla-assistant/cla-assistant, and it is run on a dedicated instance controlled by Dai Foundation and managed by TechOps to ensure no 3rd party gets access to the signatures being collected. However, I recognize there is no trustless way to verify that the actual deployment corresponds to the code in the repository, so if there is any concern I suggest a workaround where you either set up the integration with a dedicated admin users for the given repository, or give TechOps admin access so they can set up the integration. I can also confirm that the App only asks for read only access to the email address of developers that are prompted to sign the Contributor License Agreement  Authorize CLA Assistant - contributor1998\u00d71403 183 KB  To sum it up: Permission access is needed for setup - Techops can help or a \u201cburner-admin\u201d account can be used. Contributors only have to allow read access to what their email address is \u2026 ",
