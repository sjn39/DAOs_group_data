Specification  Motivation  Product I joined the crypto ecosystem pretty late (winter 2017) but learned about Maker quite early as there were very few projects around. The idea of taking a loan on a collateral in a permissionless way, without a man in the middle and by that providing a pegged asset into the volatile crypto market was very appealing to me so I started following and using the product. I believe we did a great job so far on focusing on the core without getting distracted too much. However, I think we should start running more experiments - something MakerLabs can support.  DAO Coming from a software engineering perspective, the idea of open-source has been a constant theme for me. MakerDAO feels to me like an open-source project, but with skin in the game. I guess nobody already knows how DAOs will work in the long run and I really like the idea of not knowing that but finding out on my own and being part of that journey.  Starter, not Finisher During my professional career I always found it most enjoyable to jump into a new topic, gather people around it, craft a plan on how to move forward and execute on it. My interest on a topic tends to drift away from it once the hard problems are solved and it moves into maintenance/harvesting mode. In the past, I just looked for the next topic to jump on and repeat. Working for MakerLabs would allow me to stick to the stuff I like most while not having the need to move to the next company as soon as the next topic needs to be found.  Core Unit ID SKUNK-001  Facilitator name and information Name: Tim Schuppener Forum: @ultraschuppi R/C: @schuppi ETH Address: TBD  Facilitator Commitment I will be the main link between the Core Unit and the Maker Community, Governance and other Core Unit Facilitators. I will make sure all aspects of the Core Unit including  priorities plans progress costs  will be reported and in line with the needs of the DAO.
