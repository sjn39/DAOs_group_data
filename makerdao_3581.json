For instance, if a new proposal emerges to change the burning logic, or any other logic involving MKR or DAI, how are the expected short/mid/long term effects of this new logic evaluated. Is this evaluation based on a qualitative analysis by the expert knowledge of the core team members? or maybe are there in place simulation tools able to simulate the effect of the changes under different scenarios? If you have simulation tools, is it possible to know more about this simulation infrastructure? Thank you very much Ildefons ",
