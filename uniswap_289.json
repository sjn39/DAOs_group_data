However, once when 400 UNI has been sent to the contract, we don\u2019t have the option to move that tokens, so they will stay locked in the contract. Can you please pass those claimable UNI tokens to the contract owners instead if we provide contract addresses that are eligible to claim UNI? Thanks, Nenad ",
