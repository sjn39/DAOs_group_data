                    "content": " FlapperDistributor  What? The current Flapper is responsible for auctioning and burning MKR when the system surplus exceeds the hump parameter. Once hump is met, any additional DAI entering the surplus is diverted to the Flapper and auctioned for MKR (currently in chunks of 10,000) FlapperDistributor is a proposed new contract that would have the following functionality:  It replaces the current Flapper in the Maker contracts. Governance can vote to add multiple destination addresses each with their own weights. Once the surplus buffer exceeds the hump parameter, DAI enters FlapperDistributor and is divided among the governance approved targets according to their weights. The current Flapper contract would become one of these destination addresses, allowing us to spend a certain percentage of incoming fees on MKR burn. Governance can also remove destination addresses and modify their weights using an executive vote. Other potential destinations are myriad, but could include:  Operating Funds (potentially divided between domains) Strategic Reserves (automatically exchange DAI for ETH and accumulate) Core infrastructure development (money to help fund ETH development.) Charitable giving     Diagram courtesy of @juan  Why? This system has a number of advantages over using executive votes to distribute funds. Reduces Governance Overhead  Governance can vote on high-level priorities:  How much to allocate to growth, to burn, and to reserves.   Governance doesn\u2019t need to approve distribution of lumps of funds using an executive vote. Allows us to have infrequent votes determining distribution.  Puts the \u2018autonomous\u2019 in DAO  Leverages the advantages of the blockchain, distribution of funds doesn\u2019t require human action (beyond calling smart contract methods.) Very flexible and extensible system.  Soft-Guarantees of a certain level of MKR burn  There is an issue when allocating directly from the surplus buffer that means that it is hard to guarantee that the buffer will ever overflow into burn. If the buffer is full, people will want to use it for things that aren\u2019t MKR burn. Would be easy for governance to agree to a certain level of burn, but this would be difficult to manage in practice.  Supports budgeting and distribution of funds  We are at a point where we are trying to determine how money is distributed to domains to ensure growth. This would provide a system to do that, allowing money to flow automatically to domain multi-sigs that could then be used to pay contributors.  Supports recent governance initiatives (Strategic Reserves)  Provides a great way of accumulating strategic reserves over time, either in DAI or in other assets (when combined with an on-chain dex) It\u2019s generally thought that frequent small purchases to build a position works out better than trying to time the market and buy at the optimal point, additionally, timing purchases with decentralized governance is going to be tricky. Allows accumulation of reserves without minting and selling MKR to raise funds. Could relatively easily be expanded to include additional functionality.   How feasible is this? I think this is quite feasible. The Maker contracts were built to be modular and replaceable. The Flapper is a \u2018leaf\u2019 contract, in that it sits on the edge of the cluster and doesn\u2019t have too many interactions with other contracts (I believe only the vat.) That said, I\u2019m not a smart contract developer, and there may be interactions with other contracts that I haven\u2019t been able to recognise. I\u2019d love some high-level input from @Protocol-Engineering as to how this could work in practice, and the caveats that we\u2019d need to be aware of. ",

Because with this system governance don\u2019t necessarily have to decide which projects to fund. Instead they can make a higher level decisions on the order of \u2018spend 10% of income on projects of type x\u2019 and then domain teams or other mandated actors can distribute grants in that area from that pool of funds. Also, it\u2019s fairly hard to get MKR Holders to agree to mint MKR, for obvious reasons. Also, having this system doesn\u2019t prevent you from also having MKR Governance decide which projects they want to fund manually if they want to, that\u2019s what makes it flexible. Even if we just used this system to set the incoming percentage to (purely example numbers) 30% burn, 70% operational funds, and then Maker Governance voted on all expenditures from the operational funds, I\u2019d still view that as a win.     latetot:  Also- its not any easier to manage and needs to be shut off when the required funding is reached.   No, it doesn\u2019t really. You can distribute the income into a intermediate treasury, it doesn\u2019t need to go directly to a specific project. It could go direct to project, but I agree that then you would need to turn it off, which makes it more of a pain than just transferring directly from a treasury address or the surplus buffer.     latetot:  Furthermore, its no better for MKR holders to divert funds from burning than to keep burn untouched and mint MKR to fund projects that people agree to.   It actually is better. When you mint MKR you need to exchange it for DAI, which means paying slippage on auctions or trading fees on uniswap or another on-chain DEX. If you use the DAI income from the stability fee, you don\u2019t need to pay those costs. ",

If MKR governance agrees to this budget and list of activities, we should then figure out how to fund it and it may deserve immediate funding so that the work can start.  In this case, a FLOP auction to raise the required money would be more effective than waiting until enough money accrued through surplus to fund.  Although its a good point that FLOP auction may result in 1-2% loss due to auction fees, its still likely a small price to pay for being able to launch mission critical activities without waiting for stability fees to accrue over time.

The first part is my objective technical analysis of how to implement the Flapper Distributor. The second part is my opinion as a member of governance. Objective Technical Part Here is my technical assessment of the feasibility of Flapper Distributor to which I\u2019ll refer to as dist. The actual implementation of dist is likely to be (keg.sol)[https://github.com/makerdao/keg/blob/master/src/Keg.sol], but there are two options I see on how to insert this into Maker. Flapper Distributor Options: 1. Replace vow.flapper and point it to dist implementing the FlapLike interface which splits the Dai and forwards part of it to flap.kick. Pros  Easily allows pulling a fixed % of profit to other destination.  Cons  Either bump no longer refers to the auction lot size (it will become a % of bump) or we cannot fire off an auction every time dist.kick fires which is problematic for the auction id return value. It\u2019s not clear what the return value should be when an auction is not started. Messes with the terminology a bit. FlapLike becomes an interface for forwarding Dai instead of it\u2019s original meaning of \u201ckicking\u201d off a flap auction. Disruption to the core of Maker is more dangerous in terms of potential bugs and exploits. More consideration needs to be taken for taking this action.  2. Have dist sit beside the surplus buffer and pull Dai at a set rate. This would be similar to the DSR collection mechanism (pot.drip) which pulls Dai from the surplus buffer via vat.suck. Pros  Sits outside the core protocol which decreases the chance for bugs/exploits critically damaging the system.  Cons  It\u2019s no longer straight forward to pull a fixed % of the profit. Instead a preset rate will need to be set and adjusted such as 20k Dai / week or something.  My Personal View I believe we should go with option 2 for two reasons:  It\u2019s much more straight forward to implement. Making a change to the core protocol requires a lot of thought involved with how it affects everything, and more time must be taken for auditing, consideration because if something is wrong we cannot simply shut it off. With an external module, barring the ability to suck out unlimited Dai, we can always shut things off and try again if something goes wrong. Companies do not normally allocate a % of profit to operations. The domain teams need to be paid regardless of whether Maker is profitable or not. Additionally, what happens if there is an excess of profit? We may be over-allocating funds to domain teams when times are good. Money that could be used to increase the burn. I think is better to pull a fixed budget from the surplus for operations.  ",

It\u2019s not clear what the return value should be when an auction is not started. Messes with the terminology a bit.  FlapLike  becomes an interface for forwarding Dai instead of it\u2019s original meaning of \u201ckicking\u201d off a flap auction.    I\u2019m not convinced these are too much of a downside to be honest. Having the auction lot size become bump * burn_weight seems fine. Terminology issue is irritating, but not functionally dangerous.     hexonaut:  Disruption to the core of Maker is more dangerous in terms of potential bugs and exploits. More consideration needs to be taken for taking this action.   So absolutely agree that this shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. That said, I don\u2019t really see the Flapper as a core component, it sits on the edge of the contracts it has relatively little interaction with the other contracts. As far as I can tell the interactions are:   flap() on the vow is called by an external address to trigger the auction/distribution which calls kick() on the flapper.  flapper calls move on the vat so that it owns the DAI it requires for the auction/distribution.  cage (Emergency Shutdown) related stuff, I think this is to shutdown auctions gracefully.      hexonaut:  It\u2019s no longer straight forward to pull a fixed % of the profit. Instead a preset rate will need to be set and adjusted such as 20k Dai / week or something.   In my mind this is a fairly large con with option 2. It means that you can\u2019t guarantee a fixed percentage of burn, and it means that if stability fee revenue drops then you need to adjust this value to prevent it from draining the surplus buffer.     hexonaut:  consideration because if something is wrong we cannot simply shut it off. With an external module, barring the ability to suck out unlimited Dai, we can always shut things off and try again if something goes wrong.   We could still shut it off if it went wrong. If I understand correctly, we\u2019d just need to reauthorize the current flapper and retract the authorization for dist. I think having something authorized to call vat.suck would be equally risky (both have permission to move dai out of the protocol.)     hexonaut:  The domain teams need to be paid regardless of whether Maker is profitable or not. Additionally, what happens if there is an excess of profit? We may be over-allocating funds to domain teams when times are good. Money that could be used to increase the burn. I think is better to pull a fixed budget from the surplus for operations.   I don\u2019t really disagree, but I don\u2019t think this is a valid reason not to implement this. I would prefer to see surplus sucked to a treasury from which domains were paid rather than it going directly to domain teams. If there is an excess in the treasury, it can be moved back to the surplus buffer or kept as a reserve to pay the domain teams in less profitable times. There is always going to be an issue with paying the domain teams when Maker is not profitable, admittedly, having something automatically suck would work slightly better in this case. My concern with option 2 is that it requires manual votes from governance in order to distribute DAI. That\u2019s one of the things I was hoping to avoid. Can you maybe elaborate more on how the keg would work with suck? ",

                    "content": "So I want to clarify that both methods are completely do-able, but it is my estimation that Option 1 will take longer to get up and running although possibly only marginally.     LongForWisdom:  We could still shut it off if it went wrong. If I understand correctly, we\u2019d just need to reauthorize the current flapper and retract the authorization for dist . I think having something authorized to call vat.suck would be equally risky (both have permission to move dai out of the protocol.)   This is a fair point. Swapping back to the original flapper address with a reduction in bump would be sufficient in this case.     LongForWisdom:  My concern with option 2 is that it requires manual votes from governance in order to distribute DAI. That\u2019s one of the things I was hoping to avoid. Can you maybe elaborate more on how the keg would work with suck ?   This is not necessarily the case. Once the rate is set we can have a public method which calls vat.suck similar to how pot.drip can be called by anyone and pulls in Dai to be distributed. I\u2019ll withdraw my personal point 1. The technical side cons to option 1 are not big enough to be a factor. I still do not think that we should allocate operations funding from profit though. ",

Once the rate is set we can have a public method which calls vat.suck similar to how pot.drip can be called by anyone and pulls in Dai to be distributed.   Right, got it. This would also work, I think. We could vote on the amount to suck over unit time and the distribution addresses. I do think it would mean we\u2019d need to more actively manage the numbers though, and I\u2019m also not convinced that this isn\u2019t better as a second layer on top of the distributor. Like, imagine the distributor at the bottom, which splits income relatively between Burn, Operations and Reserves. The Operations destination is a contract that outputs fixed amounts over unit time like the keg. Every month we make sure that the Operation contract isn\u2019t too full or too empty. If it is, we modify the weight or suck Dai directly if the surplus has been drained. Alternatively, you could combine Operations and Reserves such that that contract accumulates DAI to be used to pay for Operations when the protocol is doing less well. With the keg, do you set destinations proportionally or in absolute terms? Absolute terms are good for paying salaries, and maybe other things. I worry that it\u2019s going to be more work to manage though as the stability fee income varies naturally. Like if the incoming fees drop by 50% (to the point where the keg is sucking out more than we want), how do we modify the outputs and inputs to the keg? ",

I am currently working on a pull request right now which will add support for a preset ratio of any incoming amount. This will allow you to, for example, take any Dai coming in from the vow and split it 80% to the flapper, 20% to treasury. This will be useful no matter which option we decide to go with. With regards to the options, I\u2019ve thought about it a bit more, and I think I\u2019m okay now with either option 1 or 2. Maybe we can even have both? ",

                    "content": "I really like the idea of having a % going to MKR burning from a governance perspective. It\u2019s a strong stance that Maker Protocol rewards it\u2019s MKR holders. Same goes for charity/ecosystem grant. There is a lot of public companies that have a guidance to use 50% of their profit for shareholders (I acknowledge it\u2019s not really profit we are discussing here). I think those as high level rules that shouldn\u2019t be challenged often. DeFi analysts can easily take that as an assumption for valuing MKR. Let\u2019s say we send 45% to the Treasury/Operation. The mandate from the MKR holder to domains/governance is quite clear: manage the protocol well and don\u2019t scale expenses too much so it\u2019s no longer sustainable. Minting MKR should be seen as management failure (maybe, or maybe not, excluding tail risks). It doesn\u2019t mean that some MKR will not be burn from the Treasury as well (no need to keep more than 18 months of operating expenses). But that set a shared framework. It allows us to separate governance decisions between strategic decisions (ratio for MKR burn, accepting stablecoins to solve the peg, onboarding RWA) and tactical/operational ones (rate setting, specific collateral onboarding, \u2026). Passive MKR holders/investors might care about the strategic ones and not having time/interest to read the tactical ones. ",

                    "content": "Hi everyone, just caught up on this thread so I will give my two cents. I think that it is an important meme to have a guaranteed MKR burn for MKR holders, so it would be best IMO to avoid periodic minting of bulk amounts of MKR for funding. I do think that it would be possible to have the best of both worlds if we had a set rate (option 2), that would be set by governance and would be (in profitable times) less than stability fees earned. This would allow us to maintain a predicable accrual of revenue for the protocol, just at a slower rate than normal. In addition, we could have option 1 implemented so that a percentage of the DAI from the surplus would be allocated for funding, and a portion would be used for burning MKR. This provides stability and predicability on both sides in terms of earning DAI and in terms of burning MKR because it would be a constant rate. This rate could/would work out to be less than an average salary, but would be compensated for by providing upside in terms of percentage of surplus. This would incentivize domain teams to work in a way that would generate maximum revenue for the protocol. I think that the base salary + bonus model would attract the most talented developers as it has the potential to provide a significant amount of upside, while maintaining a degree of stability. Technically speaking, I worked on the Keg a few months ago but @hexonaut has worked on it more recently in the context of this post. I will take a look today at his PR. ",
