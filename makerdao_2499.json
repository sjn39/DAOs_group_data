It\u2019s kind of common sense. If the value of ETH network (MCap) stays at $27B (compared to easily accessible world money at $37T) then ETH and DAI will have no impact on world economy. Such a complex system as ETH is not sustainable if it\u2019s just a playground for nerds without considerable business use. Why don\u2019t we all go and buy ETH then? Because ETH might have fatal flaws (technical/human/governance/adoption/legal\u2026) but in that case DAI will fail also. Also, if ETH loses its #2 spot by market cap permanently to another smart contract platform - ETH and DAI are dead because no critical mass adoption will happen. ",

Liquidations in that case serve to increase Dai demand further.  It would make more sense to sell Dai until the Peg is corrected and then to liquidate if it was necessary at that point.  OR for MakerDao to \u201cbuy\u201d the collateral in the vault for freshly minted Dai it self as it is cheaper to do so than to buy from the market at inflated Dai prices. Had this been the case during March there would have never been $0.00 bid auctions.  It is ridiculous that the system gave collateral away for free like that. ",

So long as the collateral being purchased is diversified I don\u2019t see it as a problem.  Everything gets easier as there are more diversified and liquid assets available for the system to use.  Right now that isn\u2019t the case yet (which is why this period is hard to navigate). If Dai was over peg and ETH falling for example:  Why add pressure by buying more Dai from the already demand overloaded market?  Instead I say MakerDao should sell Dai for other assets and if the price of Dai gets back in line then go ahead and buy it for the ETH. If not, trade the ETH for other assets as well if exposure to ETH was deemed too high and continue selling Dai until the price is back to Peg before unloading ETH for Dai directly.  MakerDao profits by selling Dai into a market over the Peg price and loses in the opposite scenario\u2026  Why lose when MakerDao can gain? ",
