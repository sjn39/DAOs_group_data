                    "content": " MIP41c4-SP41: Risk Facilitator Onboarding (RISK-001)  Preamble MIP41c4-SP#: 41 Author(s): @Primoz, @rema, @monetsupply Contributors: Tags: core-unit, cu-risk-001, facilitator Status: Formal Submission Date Proposed: 2022-02-08 Date Ratified: Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip41c4-sp41-risk-facilitator-onboarding-risk-001/19739 Ratification Poll URL:   Sentence Summary This subproposal onboards BA Labs, LLC as a Facilitator for the Risk (RISK-001) Core Unit, represented by @rema and @monet-supply  Specification  Motivation This MIP onboards BA Labs, LLC as the new facilitator of the Risk Core Unit. BA Labs currently has 12 contributors. We haven\u2019t branded ourselves as much in the past, but we believe we are one of the top risk management providers in DeFi. Our quality comes from talented individuals who have been analyzing risk at Maker and wider DeFi since the early beginning. Moreover, our risk dashboards - as makerburn speaks for itself - are the most comprehensive and open dashboards in DeFi that offer an in-depth look at collateral risk and on-chain activity at Maker. If the MIP4c2-SP34 in RFC passes on which this MIP is based, and if this MIP passes, the facilitation of the @Risk-Core-Unit will be handed over to Ba Labs, an LLC represented by @Risk-Core-Unit members @rema and @monetsupply. If MIP4c2-SP34 does not pass, @rema and @monet-supply are proposed as individual co-facilitators (instead of representatives from BA Labs, LLC) for the @Risk-Core-Unit.  Core Unit ID Name - Risk ID - RISK-001  Facilitator name and information Name - Marko \u0160temberger Forum - @rema Discord - mar#9661  Motivation I joined the crypto movement in 2013 as a potential alternative to the currently broken fiat-based monetary and financial system. I believe that no entity should have the ability to control the fates of many individuals via controlling the supply of money and who can use it and how which is one of the most fundamental constructs of modern human societies. MakerDAO attracted me due to my interest in monetary systems and obvious differentiation from other projects, in the fact that the focus of the project was historically on the development of the service rather than maximizing the financial outcome of early contributors via \u201chyping and price pumping\u201d, which is a phenomenon present in the majority of existing projects. For me, the main prospect of the crypto movement is the large potential to make a fundamental difference for all individuals, especially those born in unfortunate locations and circumstances. MakerDAO, in my opinion, was always one of the purest projects that actually followed this thesis in practice. Assuming the role of the Risk Core Unit facilitator is a great responsibility, but one which gives the ability to influence the development of MakerDAO and greater open finance ecosystem. The ability to influence motivates me, which offsets the burden of the function.  Facilitator Commitment As a facilitator, I commit to act in the best interest of the MakerDAO and relevant stakeholders, and to maintain the high quality standards and the risk-averse conservative approach to risk management that the Core Unit\u2019s predecessors established. I commit to continue delivering professional contributions from our team to the best of my ability, which ensure that MakerDAO is not exposed to unsustainable risk instances and is subjected to low-quality collateral assets. I will be open to feedback from anyone, a known face or a complete stranger, and will consider every opinion or criticism on our recommendations, current system settings within our mandate, or external developments in the crypto financial markets and their potential impact on the MakerDAO. I will do my best to incorporate good and productive feedback, while also not hesitate to express rejection of various opinions which might want to direct the community in unsound and intolerable decision-making. I commit to follow and respect the decision-making of the MakerDAO\u2019s governance, which is the primary interest group in this construct. Still, I will always consider the interest and well-being of vault users, especially dai holders, the most vulnerable stakeholders.  Facilitator Credentials Full-time Risk team contributor since September 2019 under the previous team lead Cyrus and later continued my contributions under current facilitator Primo\u017e. I have participated in reviewing and recommending many different parameter types and conducting analyses which RISK-001 was recommending or publishing, including but not limited to on-chain collateral types, auctions, on-chain collateral onboarding risk assessments, developing initial iterations and current iteration of risk model and conducting background research, such as historical analysis of crypto-related large market drawdowns and what could have sparked the panic and consequent sell-off. I have been an official member of the PPG-MOMC-001 group since December of last year but had contributed to the recommendations of the Risk team unofficially prior to becoming a member via team contributions. Since its inception, I have been responsible for representing our team in the on-chain collateral management initiative. I have published numerous signal requests and forum posts relevant to the operations of RISK-001 defined by the mandate of the core unit. Note that I joined the forum officially with an account later than I started my contributions; I naturally tend to have a low presence with interactions on social media. I was one of the authors of MIP74, passed but not yet utilized in practice.  Other Credentials Bachelor in business and economics, dropped out during masters degree due to increased interest in crypto-related activities and work opportunities in the space. I have worked full-time in the crypto space since the summer of 2017, my main occupation was of analytical nature.  Conflicts of Interest I do not have any significant exposure to assets or other crypto-related projects via equity investment or project tokens, which could put me in a position where personal interest could jeopardize my decision-making and thought process in my contributions to MakerDAO. I do not hold any position or function in other crypto communities. I am exposed to the value of MKR and, as such, have a financial interest in its success.  Facilitator name and information Name - monetsupply Forum - @monet-supply Discord - monet_supply#4662  Motivation I\u2019m a relative newcomer to crypto, having bought my first tokens in 2019 and beginning to use DeFi in 2020. But I have significant experience within the finance industry, having worked for the previous five years with a traditional financial institution before facing layoffs in the depths of the Covid pandemic in early 2020. This experience was a wake-up call for me, laying bare the extreme lack of resilience within traditional finance along with the arbitrary and capricious nature of government interventions; my prior employer nearly faced ruin due to inconsistent specification and application of government credit support programs. MakerDAO immediately stood out to me as a visionary project with a sincere, passionate, welcoming community, and has been my primary home in crypto ever since. Further developments since then, such as reaction to the Canadian trucker protests and other cases of expanding government censorship and surveillance, have only deepened my conviction around Maker\u2019s core mission: to support peoples\u2019 financial security and freedom with resilient technical and cryptoeconomic mechanisms rather than the fundamentally fragile and ineffective protections offered by governments. In my view, safe, decentralized, and resilient money is a moral imperative. I believe that serving as a Risk Core Unit facilitator offers a unique opportunity for me to make a positive impact, for the protocol as well as the overall financial system. Sound risk management will be a cornerstone of Maker\u2019s journey towards broader usage and acceptance, and I\u2019m excited to contribute to this mission with all of my efforts.  Facilitator Commitment I am committed to always acting in the best interests of MakerDAO and Maker protocol stakeholders in my capacity as facilitator. I will respect the will of Maker governance, as expressed by participating MKR holders and delegates, while ensuring they receive as much information and feedback as possible to enable sound decision-making on their part. To the best of my ability, I will ensure the delivery of work product that meets the high standards of quality and timeliness that Maker has come to expect from the Risk Core Unit. In particular, I commit to maintaining strong, conservative standards of prudential risk management, befitting a base-level financial primitive like the Maker protocol. Dai and vault users place significant trust in the protocol to continue operating safely and soundly, and I view fulfilling this mandate as our highest responsibility. I will be responsive to feedback from voters, users, the Maker community, and the broader ecosystem, whether positive or negative. Ideas and feedback will be considered purely on their merits, without prejudice, based on the source or person involved. I will seek to incorporate beneficial external proposals and feedback into our work while offering forthright and constructive criticism in cases that could cause unacceptable risk or deviation from Maker\u2019s collectively agreed mission and values. Transparency and value alignment are critical for the success of the workforce and broader protocol. Where applicable, I will dutifully disclose and mitigate potential conflicts of interest and avoid any form of entanglement or entrenchment that could negatively impact Maker.  Facilitator Credentials I have served as a Risk team contributor since September 2020 after Primo\u017e took the lead of the team. During my time with Maker, I have worked on various projects and risk initiatives, including sourcing and analyzing new collateral types, researching potential new business lines, developing analytical frameworks for the management of debt floor (dust) and other system parameters, and maintaining data resources for use by MOMC. Since its inception, I have also served as a member of the rates working group / MOMC, providing risk and strategic feedback on parameter changes. I have experience communicating system updates, parameter changes, and Maker\u2019s values to a broader audience outside the Maker community. I have also developed contacts across other DeFi protocols. I look forward to leveraging these relationships for Maker\u2019s benefit across external integrations and partnerships, while always continuing to put Maker\u2019s interests first.  Other Credentials I have received a BA in philosophy and undertook significant coursework in economics. Prior to joining the crypto space in 2020, I worked for five years in the traditional finance industry for a non-bank lender, where I held various responsibilities across customer service, training, product, technical writing, and investment service and sales. Since engaging with crypto, I have devoted significant time to testing (aping) protocols across the DeFi space, not only within the Ethereum ecosystem but also across alternative L1 EVM chains, L2s, Solana, and Cosmos appchains, which has provided a good base of knowledge for understanding DeFi mechanisms, industry trends, and strategic positioning.  Conflicts of Interest I am a delegate with external protocols, most notably Compound and Uniswap, with smaller voting support in other protocols, including ENS, GTC, and a few others. Certain protocols where I am a delegate or informal forum commenter may be potentially in competition with Maker, such as Compound and Aave. I currently serve as a reviewer on the Osmosis grants program, which comes with a small stipend. I have made private investments in certain crypto projects and companies, including Lido, B Protocol, Rabbithole, and Neon EVM. I also hold a broad set of public investments in crypto tokens (including some potential Maker competitors) such as AAVE, COMP, EUL, BLD, CMDX, UMEE, FLX, and others. I will provide disclosures for any cases where my work intersects with any personal engagements or investments that could pose or create the appearance of a material conflict of interest. ",
