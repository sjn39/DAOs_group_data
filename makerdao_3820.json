                    "content": " Context We have lately seen a lot of heat in the forum regarding how Real-World Assets should move forward. While some become uncomfortable with the idea of a DAO having an internal conflict, I see this as an opportunity to surface and fix all the issues pending to ensure that we move sustainably. Back to the drawing board, then, where we can all zoom out and focus on building!  Disclaimers  I think RWF is an avenue (if not the avenue) that will bring Maker to the next level. Let\u2019s scale it (in a sustainable way). I am not a Real-World Finance expert. I don\u2019t even play one on TV. My initial attempt at a Framework provides more questions than answers. Ideally, the real experts will join me (or take over).    Building Blocks  Abstraction I don\u2019t want to become an expert in real estate. Or farming. Or solar projects. Or invoice factoring. I assume most MKR holders share this feeling. We need the relevant Core Units, the Community, partners, and external experts to take care of the details.  Governance Overload Avoidance MKR holders want RWF to move forward. That said, it might be unfair to assume that they have thoroughly read the implementation details and want things to proceed precisely as outlined. It is possibly a full-time job to keep up with what is happening in the Real-World Finance area within Maker, and I tend to believe that voters have perhaps other duties.  Code is Law? Is it if the code is buggy? Or if it can be improved? I would not want our Protocol Engineering team to avoid making improvements on some module \u201cbecause the MKR holders voted for that specific implementation\u201d. I want to think that any MKR holder will vote for a \u201cbetter\u201d implementation.  Risk Appetite and Critical Failure There are different degrees of risk that, ideally, we can price accordingly. That said, anything that could lead to a critical failure should be sandboxed, tested, and improved until it is not critical anymore.   Another Framework  Code is Law We need a framework to evaluate, audit, and prioritize all the deals coherently. That should lead to more transparency, less second-thinking intentions, and more trust across the ecosystem.  Upgradeable The framework does not need to be perfect. It needs to be a model for all to agree on how to evaluate a deal. Ideally, anyone can propose ideas to improve it.  Removing Bottlenecks Much like the risk team has established assessments to evaluate collateral types (and the Community does many), we need to replicate this model to remove bottlenecks and standardize the process as much as possible.  Moving through the Onboarding Funnel Ideally, we have some checkmarks and checkpoints that each deal or collateral type needs to prove to unlock more debt ceiling, reduce stability fees, etc. We have many parameters to limit and charge for risk. We need our brightest to start working on this.   An Initial RWA Framework: an MVP We need to define a way of abstracting all the deals and making sure that they are comparable. Some starting points:  Parameters What are they? Are there different groups for them? What are acceptable ranges? Which ones could be changed unilaterally, which ones could not, and which ones might be?  Process  How are the parameters defined? How can they be changed? Is an email an acceptable method for communicating anything? Should Maker approve all changes by default? Should there be a different process for changing a parameter from a group to another group? Can or should an Asset Originator be able to change something? If yes, what? If no, how should Maker react?   Transparency  Which documents should be public? In which form Should there be any proxies? Should we have several actors representing different parties to avoid conflicts of interest? Is a proxy (trusted actor by Maker) reviewing the contracts enough? Should they be public? Will the Assets Originators accept that? All of them?   Incentives  What are the incentives for all the actors in the value chain? Is there any type of subsidy that might be skewing the numbers? Would any actor have a reason to apply favouritism? How can this be avoided?   Auditing  Which documents need auditing? At which point? Which firms could provide an audit? How do we measure their reputation? Is there any way to evaluate their independence (agency problem) by anyone interested in doing so?   Bugs and Post-Mortems  How are bugs defined? Who defines them? What should we do when a bug is found? What is the procedure? What happens with different types of bugs (based on criticality)? Who is in charge of the Post Mortem?   Compatibility  Can this framework be compatible with the one for digital assets? Is it possible to improve that framework based on this one?  ",

On this recent NewSilver deal there were terms like the max percentage that should be invested in a single (US) state and other terms regarding loan-to-value ratios. Dear people in this community - this.will.not.scale. There is just no way we can learn the ins and outs of every industry and offer a tailored package like that of a specialized fiat investment firm. Do note that this is in no way criticism of the people doing the deal (cough - I am myself on the rwa commitee) but just something we learn going forward in this ongoing experiment. Do we really need to know more than these two things?  Is the applying company real? What would they pay in interest rate if they had to source from fiat?  The first is standard due diligence work. The second is with some deviation to be found using google. That\u2019s it. What percentage they subsequently invest in what state, their loan-to-value ratios, or if they just blow it on coke and strippers I could not care less about as long as they pay back what they owe us.

Besides, many successful startups have gone from one product idea, and pivot-it to another. But obviously most community members don\u2019t want potential clients to pivot\u2013so, yea\u2013maybe a new framework with experience characters would work best.

My major concerns, for the time being, are:  no clear map of the risk / reward spectrum (e.g. development projects are so much rewarding, yet so very risky; farmlands, timber, solar are rather alternatives within alternatives and so the question is how liquid are they\u2026, etc.) no clear way to swiftly and objectively assess \u201cis this a good deal?\u201d (e.g. no large datasets with price points, no easy way to check the investment against market sentiment - now Resi in the US seems to be too hot to handle and so what will happen to those dev projects that are to come to market in 6-12 months, would the market still be growing?) how to check the project\u2019s status in an objective manner to see how it performs (both, the dev projects and the standing assets)?

Trying to understand the correlation to David Swensen style of management\u2026   My Yale reference was to @SebVentures earlier point on their slim structure (roughly 30 people on 30B USD) while e.g. HMC (Harvard\u2019s investment arm) has close to 200 people on some 40B. Swensen as Yale\u2019s CIO was a unique person, sort of super-human who did an extraordinary job which is usually done by many more, therefore his role was central and key to the Yale\u2019s Inv Office success over many years. Although I believe there\u2019s tons of wisdom in the way Yale run their endowment (e.g. their focus on Risk), I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s easily applicable to a more decentralized organization like MakerDAO. Honestly, I\u2019d need to deep dive even more into the strategy, roadmap and objectives of MKR to be able to recommend sort of role model, nonetheless - it\u2019s a great idea by Seb to be even looking this direction for guidance as they are a well-run entity with plenty of success over the course of decades.

And DAI are pegged to the dollar. So while large inflation lowers our profits, we are less captive to inflation compressing our net interest margin. That\u2019s mostly because we rub our hands together and magic up the DAI, so any yield >0 can be profitable \u2014 which is, of course, not the same as paying us for the risk we assume by issuing or guaranteeing the debt in the first place.

So on the currency level it\u2019s a great solution, yet on an investment / lending level, especially while dealing with real-world assets, it does not help much. Let\u2019s take the current 5% US inflation as an example, and let\u2019s assume for easier math that it continues to be at such level for the next 10 years (highly unlikely). Let\u2019s say in the year 2020 we invest 10M DAI into X and let\u2019s say we will get the money back in 2030 - although what we\u2019d get back would still be 10M DAI yet what we\u2019d be able to buy with it in 2030 is just 50% of the goods we acquired in 2020\u2026 Of course there\u2019s some level of stability fee and maybe initially it was thought out as a way to keep the purchasing power in place or maybe inflation wasn\u2019t much of a problem at the DAI\u2019s drawing table (especially while on-chain only) but in the real assets investment space inflation is quite important and has to be accounted for.

Since it\u2019s back to the drawing board, perhaps I can ask a question that I\u2019ve been too embarrassed to ask for a while now (I\u2019m relatively new, so I\u2019ve missed out on so much previous discussion \u2014 sorry!): When I first saw references to real-world assets being onboarded, I assumed they would be tokenized wrapped assets, e.g. shares of US equities, and we would onboard them like any other liquid ERC20 token. The risks we\u2019d have to assess would be those of 1) the asset itself, plus 2) the ability of whoever is doing the wrapping (e.g. the WBTC DAO or Paxos with Pax Gold) to actually redeem the token for the asset. We wouldn\u2019t be inventing any new legal or technical mechanisms for this; our tried and true collateral onboarding, liquidation, etc, would work. However, as far as I can see, we don\u2019t have any assets like this as collateral. Is that because none with with any serious volume exist for us to onboard? Has no one successfully wrapped US equities and achieved liquidity yet? (A USStocks index token seemed like a great idea, but I guess it didn\u2019t go anywhere?) Instead, it seems like the current RWA direction we\u2019re pursuing is to originate loans directly to real-world entities and hold property as collateral that can\u2019t be autonomously auctioned on a DEX nor redeemed during emergency shutdown? It seems like such a break from our current, well-oiled model that has been battle-tested for years and earned trust by holding the peg and not being hacked for all that time. I\u2019m sure there are good threads to read where all these discussions have happened before; can someone point me at them? ",

So we can either wait or work already. Centrifuge might be an ERC20 way, so investing in DROP is as much a way to invest our balance sheet as partnering to build the future of DeFi. This is why the RWF CU is prioritizing more looking forward stuffs (but also exploring the trust stuff as it might be useful in any case). We don\u2019t see investing in RWA like TradFi as a competitive advantage in the future (but something we might need to do to bridge the gap and learn).   Liquid ERC20 tokens as collateral will not be super profitable. The collateral is liquid and therefore margin will be super low in the order of risk-free rate + 10 bps (as the risk is super low, liquidation was a hard problem in 2020, difficult in 2021 but will be quite simple in 2025). As a comparison, you can borrow cheaply against TSLA stock and it doesn\u2019t even trade 60% of the time. It might work for us as we might have economies of scale. We will see. There is a reason banks don\u2019t invest only in risk-free assets.   Therefore you end up with illiquid ERC20 (or straight RWA). To us, illiquidity is defined as daily volume < 1-5% market cap (so it can still be quite liquid but not enough for a quick liquidation). That\u2019s what finance is about, how to bridge the short-term preference of savers (DAI holders) with the long-term need of projects.   It\u2019s not super visible, but things are moving. We have discussions with ERC20 stock index providers, with crypto-natives AAA-rated bonds issuers, \u2026 but, yeah, it\u2019s taking just too much time. When a RWA startup takes one month to have a meeting with regulators and lawyers, a crypto-only startup can fork some code, get $2B TVL and get rekt. ",

As to your points #2 and #3, I agree \u2014 but I sort of value stopping at barely profitable, highly liquid, completely on chain ERC-20 assets that can be managed by our battle-tested liquidation and emergency shutdown procedures. The code has been running for years and remains unhacked despite billions of dollars of incentive to do so, the peg has held, and that is (in my circles) why MKR is held in such high regard relative to any other crypto project.
