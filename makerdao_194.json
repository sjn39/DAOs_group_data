                    "content": "Hi, all! CES update #3. First, let\u2019s start with our new hires!   Kau\u00ea Cano @kaue will be joining us as a Smart Contract Engineer! Most recently, Kau\u00ea worked at Jigstack as a Blockchain Lead and led local and remote teams of smart contract and dApp developers involving multiple DeFi products of the Jigstack ecosystem. Prior to Jigstack, Kau\u00ea worked with or founded companies focusing on state-of-the-art on Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Blockchain, and DeFi.   Nazar Duchak will be joining us as a Smart Contract Engineer! Most recently, Nazar worked at ParaSwap as a Blockchain Developer and was involved with pricing aggregation, partner exchange integration, and designing and building ParaSwap\u2019s infrastructure. Prior to ParaSwap, Nazar worked for IOV Labs (RSK and RIF Platforms), Aeternity, as well as a variety of organizations as a full stack developer.   Phil Elsasser @0xean will be joining us as an Advisor to the CES Core Unit! Phil is the Head of Technology at the new Fox Foundation supporting the efforts of the ShapeShift DAO. Previous to his role with the Fox Foundation, Phil was the CTO and lead solidity developer on ElasticDAO core, worked for Amazon in Measurement and Data Science, was a founder of a DeFi crypto startup called MARKET Protocol, and has led numerous technical teams in the web2 and web3 space. His early career was spent building trading algorithms and execution systems on proprietary trading desks in Chicago which cemented his fascination in capital markets and the DeFi ecosystem.   Please take a moment to welcome Kau\u00ea, Nazar, and Phil to the CES Core Unit and MakerDAO. I\u2019m excited for them to bring their background, talents, and experiences to the team and the protocol! Again, I want to thank all that have assisted CES in hiring our team: PE (Chris & Brian), Oracles (Mark-Andr\u00e9), SES (Wouter), and Talent (Teodor). The CES Core Unit kicked off on Oct 4 and within six weeks, we\u2019ve been able to identify, interview, and make offers for all key positions (one more is coming that I will announce shortly). That is quite an accomplishment given the talent environment, the newness of a DAO, and industry we work within. CES Status This week, Nikolaj and Henrique formally started with the CES Core Unit\u2026and what a perfect week to start! Both were able to immediately jump in, while onboarding, and materially contribute to the WBTC-B, SocGen contract review/assessment, and MIP21 work. We also had our initial meeting with PE to discuss the initial transition of collateral work from PE to CES. Next week, Kau\u00ea will start on Nov 24 and Nazar will join us part time until Dec 20 as he winds down his ParaSwap work. Prior to the team starting, my time was focused on getting the CES Core Unit up and running, from an operational perspective, aligning with key Core Unit stakeholders, and recruiting the team. This week, we started the transition into operating the Core Unit and working to deliver on our mandate:  Scale the Dai supply (1T) by enabling anyone to onboard collateral in a stable and cost effective manner.  So, what\u2019s next? CES Focus & Deliverables In the past six weeks, I have learned a lot and am excited about the opportunity ahead of us. As we stay true to our crypto native roots, I believe the MakerDAO has a tremendous future by enhancing real world asset exposure to help us deliver on the CES mandate. In the short time remaining before the end of the year, the CES Core Unit will focus on a variety of goals and deliverables:  Onboard new CES team members Continue to identify and transition collateral activities from PE to CES Collateral process and coordination of MakerDAO stakeholders CES Strategic Planning  As always, please reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback on the above.

Our first priority is filling our open positions on the team. Today, I am very excited to announce two new hires:   Nikolaj Lollike will be joining us as a Solutions Architect! I\u2019ve worked closely with Nikolaj at the Maker Foundation where he was the Lead of the Integrations Team. Most recently, he was working within the SES Core Unit. Nikolaj brings in a WEALTH of experience and knowledge about the Maker ecosystem especially with collateral management and the integration of Dai into a variety of platforms. I couldn\u2019t think of a better Maker OG to join our team!   Henrique Barcelos will be joining us as a Smart Contract Engineer! Most recently, Henrique worked for Kleros as a Full Stack Blockchain Engineer. He has an extensive background in Web 2 and 3 technologies which will enable the CES team deep coverage on the range of technologies used for collateral management. Henrique is gearing up to be a Maker OG really soon!   Please join me and welcoming both Nikolaj and Henrique to the CES Core Unit! And\u2026we have a number of candidates in our recruiting pipeline and anticipate hiring the rest of the team in the next several weeks. Stay tuned!  High Priority Items Now that we are adding new members to the team, there are a number of higher priority items we are focusing on:  Onboarding new contributors into the CES Core Unit Offloading collateral onboarding from the PE Core Unit Provide clarification on when and how to use MIP6 including parameters for collateral offboarding Partnering with RWF, PE, Oracles, Risk, & Growth on the implementation of the SocGen collateral application Detailed product planning for crypto native and real world assets Continuing to setup the operations of the CES Core Unit  It\u2019s no small feat to operationalize a Core Unit! I greatly appreciate the assistance from the PE, Oracle, and SES Core Units especially with their help in interviewing our candidates. ",

For the ones who do not know me, I\u2019ve been working on scaling the demand side of Dai for 2.5 years at the Maker Foundation Integration Team, where we together with Business Development (now Growth CU) grew the number of integrations of mainly Dai and Vaults from 200 to just shy of 1000 in the timespan I was involved. We also wrote many guides on how to integrate with Maker, and even created a handbook for collateral onboarding - together with Risk, PE, and Oracles. I\u2019ve since then spent almost half a year at SES, where I\u2019ve helped incubate some really rock star teams, that will hopefully be accepted by Maker Governance very soon! Now I\u2019m excited to shift my focus back to integrations, albeit this time it will be from the Maker POV in terms of integrating collateral and tackle what I find the most interesting problem of MakerDAO: Scaling the Dai supply. I\u2019m hopeful I can use my experience from the Integration Team, and incubation program in SES to help the developers of CES team get up to speed quickly on everything Maker, so we can start executing quickly and work towards 1 trillion Dai  ",

SES has and will continue to openly encourage contributors to go where they feel they can have the most significant impact on their careers and MakerDAO\u2019s vision.   Nikolaj Nikolaj has played a significant role in bootstrapping SES\u2019 incubation program. He was of great help facilitating the meetings with the incubees, organizing resources, sharing Maker knowledge, and making sure that each incubee had what they needed to succeed. @lollike, @SES-Core-Unit will miss you and is looking forward to seeing your subsequent victories with @collateral-core-unit.
