                    "content": "All of these Gini coefficient posts are not necessarily helping us get to any conclusions. Let me first drop the definition:  The Gini index or Gini coefficient is a statistical measure of distribution developed by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912. It is often used as a gauge of economic inequality, measuring income distribution or, less commonly, wealth distribution among a population. The coefficient ranges from 0 (or 0%) to 1 (or 100%), with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality. Values over 1 are theoretically possible due to negative income or wealth.  Using the Gini coefficient on DGD token is like using the Gini coefficient on TESLA stock. It is not appropriate and is not even likely possible. Typically you would use the Gini coefficient to look at individuals in a society, where you know how many distinct people live in the society and how much they earn in salary or how much they own in property. Please let me know how I could look at any of these graphs and draw any conclusions. ",
