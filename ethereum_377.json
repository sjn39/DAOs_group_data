I was recently thinking about NFTs which are songs and can be duplicated/shared under some conditions and I think this interface it\u2019s the perfect minimal thing you\u2019d need. Any special reason why you are restricting transfer on the implementation? Also, I think  you should increment the _currentIndex on the share function.  It\u2019s always nice to have tests included for the reference implementations. Edit: I just saw this is already final ",
