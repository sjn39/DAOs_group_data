Having proven product-market fit for highly decentralized financial infrastructure with a platform that has thrived independently, Uniswap is now particularly well positioned for community-led growth, development, and self-sustainability. t is crucial that governance is constrained to where it is strictly necessary. With this in mind, the Uniswap governance framework is limited to contributing to both protocol development and usage as well as development of the broader Uniswap ecosystem. After 30 days, governance will reach its vesting cliff and Uniswap governance will control all UNI vested to the Uniswap treasury. At this point, governance can vote to allocate UNI towards grants, strategic partnerships, governance initiatives, additional liquidity mining pools, and other programs. A community-managed treasury opens up a world of infinite possibilities. ",

A very small % of UNI holders finds themselfes in \u2018Governance-meta\u2019 subforum. #2 Functionally the closest thing to UNI token from the traditional financial world is shares. You can vote as a shareholder, but you don\u2019t have to vote as a shareholder to receive dividends. When answering the question about rewarding UNI holders an important clarification needs to be made: How should UNI holders be rewarded? I see 2 ways to reward UNI holders:  With supply dilution - from the community treasury fund. This in my opinion is meaningless and achieves nothing, a lot of reasons for that were expressed above.  With the value that the protocol produces.  The second way is quite beneficial and necessary in my opinion, as it brings the value to the token. If part of the fees gained by the platform goes towards UNI holders, it becomes much easier for people to assess the value of their holdings by using metrics from traditional markets analysis. So, when speaking about the 2nd way, I don\u2019t think that much participation should be needed to receive ETH rewards from trading activity on the platform. As @mak already noted, forced participation is not a good thing. If it was up to me, I would distribute ETH rewards for holding the token and UNI rewards for active participation in the network. ",

I think I would like to see ETH rewarded to UNI stakers from transaction fees and UNI rewarded for providing liquidity and participating in protocol governance out of the 2% inflation rate, and perhaps out of the community chest before inflation kicks in. Obviously, the delegates should be rewarded foremost, and then the voters.

So far, in various projects, it looks like incentivizing governance leads to decisions that are either less thought-about or less long-term - although I am aware that \u201clong-term\u201d in DeFi might have a different definition. People would vote just to be voting. Or they would choose to vote to anything promising an higher yield.

So the holders have intensive to allocate and delegates (voters) to delegate (vote) Further we need to find out if we gone give a APY % to all Holders and voters, how much that gone realistically. Also we need t look at sustainability, can we have nice APY to cover the gas cost on short term? we need to keep in mine we gone get a lot of new people coming into to crypto space the coming years  and we need to provide eazy solutions fore theme, there gone come in and tray stuff out and the next weak thy wanna tray something else. So we need to provide the proper setting fore them. I think this can be that proper setting. ",

This can be via voting, potentially promoting or lending or whatever the network needs. However, I do believe the token should try and hold some value and provide incentives to holders beyond governance. I also agree with Po that Uni holders should be rewarded with some of the value from the network opposed to diluting uni supply. Rewarding UNI to UNI holders is pointless, getting value from the network will increase participation in protocol governance and have people more emotionally invested in the success of the platform.

This could help prevent whales.  If you hold uni for longer and longer, like 1 year, 2 so on, the percentage your unis are earning should increase. Maybe lastly if your active in governace and voting ideas you get alittle extra, just to say thanks. ( I shortened it for you all, sorry again. ",

A very small % of UNI holders finds themselfes in \u2018Governance-meta\u2019 subforum.  However despite this strong bias, the vote still seems to vastly favor rewards for UNI holders, even without participation in governance.

In the short term, I think Uniswap should invest in growing the platform and solidifying it\u2019s dominance as a DEX.  In the short term, this may mean the treasury will be better spent incentivizing users and liquidity providers, or hiring developers to accelerate protocol improvements.  Doing this improves the odds of Uniswap being the dominant DEX platform when the market reaches maturity (which could be many years from now). Once the DeFi market matures, I imagine daily DEX volume could be on the order of hundreds of billions dollars.  At that point the protocol fee can be turned on, which would generate billions of dollars daily for the community.  Some portion of those fees could then be used to return money to UNI holders. A little back of the envelope math: $100b daily volume 0.05% protocol fee $50 million daily fees to the UNI community 90% distribution ratio $45 million distributed to UNI holders daily $16.424 billion distributed to UNI holders yearly That\u2019s nearly 3x the current market cap of the token on an annual basis. But the only way returns like that are possible is if we think long term and not get greedy in the short term.  It\u2019ll be a journey, let\u2019s go onward together! ",
