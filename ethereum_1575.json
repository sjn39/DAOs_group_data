Nakamoto\u2019s system is powered by physical computing resources, and the blockchain is maintained by PoW-miners; there, each winning PoW-miner can extend the blockchain with a new block. In our design, as argued above, we (intend to) use both physical resources and virtual resources. That means, in addition to PoW-miners, a new type of players \u2014 PoS-holder (stakeholder) \u2014 is introduced in our system. Now a winning PoW-miner cannot extend the blockchain immediately. Instead, the winning PoW-miner provides a base which enables a PoS-holder to be \u201cselected\u201d to extend the blockchain. In short, in our system, a PoW-miner and then a PoS-holder jointly extend the blockchain with a new block. If Nakamoto\u2019s consensus can be viewed as a 1-hop protocol, then ours is a 2-hop protocol.\u201d Merging PoW and PoS would prevent possibility of another hardfork by PoW miners after ETH moves to PoS, also it supports the PoW miners who had been supporting the network since its infancy, instead of ditching miners entirely wouldn\u2019t it be better to integrate them into a new system where PoS and PoW can work in parallel, supporting each other. 2016-716.pdf ",

The proposal aims to integrate PoW miners into a new system where PoS and PoW can work in parallel, supporting each other. The post also suggests that merging PoW and PoS would prevent the possibility of another hardfork by PoW miners after ETH moves to PoS. The post explains the proposed system and its benefits.
