                    "content": " Overview During the market movements on 2022-01-22 we have seen tons of vault-liquidations leading to a massive spike of flap auctions. As we don\u2019t have a Liq2.0 equivalent for the MKR-burn, a lot of the added income by the penalty-fees of the liquidations have been sold in multiple parallel MKR-auctions (flaps) resulting in a huge slippage (more details here):  Over the weekend a couple of mitigations have been discussed that can be put in place:  introducing a rate-limiting into the Flapper adding dutch auctions (Liquidations 2.0) for MKR-burn \u2026  This post is not about moving forward in any of those directions but just to stop the bleeding of uncontrolled MKR burn, buying us time to have a viable fix.  Proposed Action I\u2019d like to suggest that we  deactivate the currently configured lerp of 1MM/week for the Surplus Buffer  and instead set the Surplus Buffer to 250 MM - which will hopefully be enough to buy us some time to implement a viable solution to this problem   Pros  Avoid auctioning MKR with the potential for high slippage.   Cons  No more MKR burning until we have a replacement implementation in place During a market decline, the burn feature causes demand on buying MKR (and destroying MKR) to support the price. Indirectly this protects the hat as the economic price for a governance attack is elevated.   Poll: Shall we implement this to avoid more uncontrolled MKR burning?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     FYI @GovAlpha-Core-Unit @Recognized-Delegates @Protocol-Engineering  Next steps As this is a proposal for an Urgent Response Procedure as outlined in MIP24c4 this poll will run until 2022-01-25T14:00:00Z and will result in an onchain executive vote assuming it gets enough support.

As the proposal mentions, there are at least the following 2 options to consider:  Introducing a rate-limiting into the Flapper Adding dutch auctions (Liquidations 2.0) for MKR-burn.  I think that following this immediate action to protect the protocol we should start the process to address the root cause and start taking steps towards solving it. Failure to do so might lead to loss in confidence in the protocol too, with resulting price drop and increased risk for governance attacks. ",

IF DeFI gets a full out black swan event here that liquidates 1-2B worth of collateral.  Even if we collect 13% on all of this we end up with 260M+67M = 327M.   We will still start flapping MKR in such an event.   I would urge IF we are going to do thia lets just nail it for now with 1B SB honestly since 4B at 13% would be 520M even if we get all that.  Then at least we end up with a few years of CU funding while DeFI recovers. Worst case we liquidate 1-2B and start eating losses and lose the SB.   Then Maker governance is going to look pretty bad flapping high and flopping low again to even start covering CU budgets much less a real loss in the SB. The time it will take to discuss and then create, and test any other solutions is too long.   We could see this hit come within days now and may still be too late to close this gaping hole in the protocol. ",

That said, it looks like the volume of our burn was causing some pretty serious issues, worth pausing to reconsider what\u2019s actually going on. Personal issues aside though, I believe a full stop of burn is pretty unwise here. Reading through the comments, it seems like many of us believe there might still be significantly more drawdown, and that we should reserve DAI for any emergencies if they do come up. It\u2019s not unreasonable, especially given how inefficient our burn has been. Keeping DAI on the side here, while we sort out the burn inefficiency, and having some padding for a potential black swan\u2026 can\u2019t argue much with that logic. However, if this is actually the bottom, or close to it\u2026 THIS is when you want to burn. Everyone sees a big drop\u2026 macro is bearish\u2026 why not hold out for more blood? If there is no more blood\u2026 if THIS was it\u2026 we are passing up on a once in a very rare time to burn at optimal prices. We should resume burn once things cool down and everything is clear? Point to a bottom in any market that\u2019s clearly a bottom. It\u2019s just as easy as recognizing a top. /s Anyway\u2026 I agree with reducing the burn if it\u2019s truly been inefficient, but I can\u2019t agree with a full stop.  Reduce the burn by 75%. Burn at a 25% rate.  Maybe a lower volume can be sold with fewer issues. If there still are any, at least our risk of loss is reduced by 75%. The other 75%, we can keep on the side for more downside and a true Black Swan. But not burning\u2026 at all? at these prices? Idk, to me, seems silly.  ",

Yeah, long duration still has the weak point of non competitive auctions. Seems like this is going to pass and we\u2019ll be seeing a temporary stop to MKR burning. Hopefully we\u2019ll be able to launch a solution to be able to bring back MKR burning. ",

There is material risk ahead due to a hole in the flap auction system. We should instead focus on making the system robust. Despite the fact that we all want to see MKR continuing to be burned at these prices ASAP, I do not recommend rushing to implement an easy fix for the sake of returning to burn. Instead, let\u2019s think about what the best possible burn implementation could be. If burning is really that important, then of course implementing the new burn should be prioritized accordingly. Of course the dutch auction is an obvious upgrade to the current liquidation auction, but what if we do away with flap auctions all together? Instead we could make all the excess liquidity available at a small discount to market price, and re-target price once per week or even once per month. Let the MEV ecosystem arbitrage when the price of MKR moves down. Using fixed price swaps instead of auctions requires less transactions, greatly reduces oracle usage, does not require keepers, and has no slippage. ",
