                    "content": "Even with governance rewards potentially being activated soon, there will still be too few ways to earn yield by holding maker (either governance, or a usually sub-1% yield on Aave) - hence the MKR token price and marketcap will likely still will not catch up to more dynamic defi protocols. What I propose is to add an another option independent of makerdao governance rewards - minting DAI with MKR in the Maker Stability Module. Wait, I know what you\u2019re thinking - \u201cBut MKR the token is the backstop to black swan events on the MakerDAO platform, let\u2019s not entangle it with leverage.\u201d Firstly, using that philosophy as an excuse to prevent a tokenomics overhaul has not served the token price and thus overall community sentiment positively, so maybe it\u2019s time for change. Secondly, this signal request will borrow ideas from Synthetix (as well as Aave) that has locked up the vast majority of SNX supply and increased its market cap to more than 3x MKR\u2019s, despite total sUSD being less than 1/13 of total Dai.  Deposit MKR into the stability module. SM mints Dai worth 1/5 of the USD value of MKR (similar to the SNX staking 500% overcollateralization), over time governance can change this value. Stipulate (inspired by aave stability module) that black swan events like March 2020 sell MKR staked in the SM above the printed DAI value first to recapitalize MakerDAO (before then printing new tokens), instead of the flawed stability buffer where makerdao will likely incur massive opportunity cost in 2021 by holding $4MM USD worth of inflationary fiat-based DAI in a crypto bull market. If the proportion of staked MKR is anywhere near the proportion of staked SNX, this along with the token price pump of tokenomics overhaul will be more than enough to hedge some sort of failure a la March 2020, or a potential USDT insolvency crisis. In exchange, those that deposit MKR in this pool get a portion of protocol fees, perhaps similar to governance voting rewards. (hopefully get rid of burn, split it half and half). And for that extra risk, MSM get any yield they can get from Dai on a 3rd party platform on top of rewards from maker protocol fees. Could also consider giving extra governance voting weight for those taking the extra risk. As an added bonus, this provides resistance against diluting MKR holders that choose to vote in governance without leverage for rewards or not stake at all. Creates another potential 100MM Dai (even more Dai if MKR pumps), that can be released into the wild for degen defi activity.  I have also attached an excellent podcast episode of Uncommon Core, which goes through the pros and cons of MakerDAO\u2019s and Synthetix\u2019s token models starting at timestamp 54:50: https://anchor.fm/uncommoncore/episodes/17-Defi-Top-20-with-Arthur0x--Su-Zhu-and-Hasu-eofj2n Please take a listen, as the host and guests bring up excellent points comparing and contrasting the two tokenomics models. And they\u2019re right, maker\u2019s tokenomics is stagnant and the protocol needs some radical change to climb back uphill. So in conclusion, what this request is proposing is a three pronged token utility overhaul for MKR.  Third party interest bearing MKR like aaveMKR (low risk, no involvement needed, lowest yield, already possible) Governance rewards for actively participating, or delegating to an active participant in governance voting. (low risk, some involvement needed, mid-yield, already discussed and potentially heading to exec vote: Introducing DssGovRewards) Stake in the Maker Stability Module (risky with potential of liquidation, much involvement needed, but gets equivalent of governance rewards + 1/5 USD value of their staked MKR in  dai that can be used for yield elsewhere, high yield) Can potentially give 2x the voting power per mkr, for taking all this risk.

But after the great progresses of the last few months, on all fronts, I now think that:  I think the governance in the forum has been stimulated enough in the recent months with SourceCred and such, and it\u2019s growing in a very healthy and relatively-quick way. MKR value comes from the burning mechanism. It doesn\u2019t matter too much if today the market does not recognise that we are currently burning 6% of MKR/year and that DAI supply is quickly increasing. It will, eventually, if we continue in the right direction. In my opinion the only problem left open is to incentivise onchain voting, somehow.  Since your proposal does not address (3), it doesn\u2019t find me very intrigued. The value of MKR will increase over time without any farming gymnic. ",

That is what I addressed in my original post, as well as the critiques from the podcast I posted. MKR has underperformed even ETH in the 2 year and 1 year timeframes despite the Dai supply and fees increasing by more than 10x-fold. The USD price of MKR stayed constant through defi summer where Aave and SNX both easily gained 100x against the dollar. I think we can say that assertion is flawed.

Even if it earns something - that money could not be spent because it must be kept as a reserve for potential losses or for fixing the peg. Sure, we burn MKR, but it is a negligible amount (see MKR price so far for proof) I think we first need to find a model which will show that MakerDAO can earn money  and then talk about the rewards. If noone is enthusiastic about the reward or sells it immediately for ETH/USD then what\u2019s the point. There is, of course, always the possibility for a MKR takeover which will raise the MKR price but I don\u2019t think that speculation is appealing to many users. ",

I think it will be more effective and a more clean growth strategy to just focus on providing high yields for MKR in stability module ",

Especially in a Mkt where folks are profiting using Maker\u2019s resources. Either that or find a way to become more profitable. Also, when product-market fit? When scaling to the masses? It\u2019s 2021 folks, not 2017. ",

Market share and marketing is by itself a hugely valuable fundamental asset! Maker is still ahead even while neglecting tokenomics, but rather than resting on the laurels, isn\u2019t it better to get even more ahead by using all the tools available to us? Taking the dogmatic high road on tokenomics is like being a politician with the greatest policies ever that refuses to campaign and appeal to the masses, and then as a result the crappy populist stays in power. Btw want to make sure I make it clear that I believe this community is amazing and kicks ass, and people like @flipflopflapdelegate are absolute rock stars. The comment above wasn\u2019t directed at you or anyone else of the awesome maker governance people. I just think that when it comes to tokenomics and learning from other projects we\u2019re stuck in a bit of an echo chamber because there are so many dumb things out there, and that makes it easy to discount all of the innovation as the same dumb irrational bs - but tokenomics, marketing and gamefication really is a big deal. It\u2019s real, it\u2019s tangible, and it should be taken seriously or we are fighting at a disadvantage. Don\u2019t forget that this entire industry was created purely from the tokenomics of bitcoin, with no other notable feature or technology to show beyond the 21 million meme. ",
