Are people interested in putting something together in Berlin this August? I\u2019ve always promoted the idea of fully decentralizing access to the Ethereum data, and have been making excellent progress lately. I\u2019d love to share my work, discuss it\u2019s implications, expand on how to proceed, etc. I\u2019m happy to try to put together an agenda, collect interested parties, but I\u2019m also totally open to supporting someone else if they wish to organize. I posted a suggestion to the Ring Formation online form, so it should show up on the agenda. Please feel free to suggest topics, discussion points, presentation topics, whatever. The more I watch the Ethereum space develope, the more I fear we are marching blindly into a situation where a few large companies are the only ones who will be able to extract and deliver historical data from the chain. This, to me, is a threat to the long-term viability of any blockchain. ",
