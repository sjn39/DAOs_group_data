                    "content": " Overview The last attempt of raising the Surplus Buffer by 40 MM DAI to 100 MM DAI failed onchain in late September. Since then, the growth rate of the System Surplus increased a lot - driven by a huge DAI demand from crypto-collateral and by DAI-supply slowly moving from PSM to crypto-vaults. As the reasoning for increasing the Surplus Buffer might be a bit lengthy, the TL;DR; is  we\u2019ll start burning soon and we should consider using the momentum to increase our treasury and increase portfolio risk compensation MKR price might get high and it becomes less efficient to burn The burning aspect doesn\u2019t do much in terms of MKR price pumps   Data Let\u2019s do a quick run down of the relevant numbers first. According to makerburn we are currently running on ~90 MM income from Stability Fees and ~40 MM expenses - leaving us with an annualized profit of ~50 MM. That\u2019s about a million per week. As the Surplus Buffer is currently set to 60 MM and we already have a System Surplus of ~57 MM DAI we will start burning MKR in about 3 weeks. Probably a bit earlier, as  Core Units expenses are usually not claiming their budget as soon as available Income from liquidations is not considered here This weeks executive will include some SF-increases which will add another ~20 MM of annualized revenue We might see some more DAI minting in the near future which will increase the revenue even more   image1261\u00d7791 67.2 KB  I created a little spreadsheet showing the different options and their effect on when we would fill a higher Surplus Buffer. Feel free to clone it and play around on your own. Taking the increased SFs into account, we would end up with something like this     Surplus Buffer increase New Surplus Buffer Burn Fraction Absolute increase per week Weeks until SB filled     $30.000.000 $90.000.000 0% $1.342.198 22   $30.000.000 $90.000.000 25% $1.006.648 30   $30.000.000 $90.000.000 50% $671.099 45   $30.000.000 $90.000.000 75% $335.549 89   $70.000.000 $130.000.000 0% $1.342.198 52   $70.000.000 $130.000.000 25% $1.006.648 70   $70.000.000 $130.000.000 50% $671.099 104   $70.000.000 $130.000.000 75% $335.549 209   $110.000.000 $170.000.000 0% $1.342.198 82   $110.000.000 $170.000.000 25% $1.006.648 109   $110.000.000 $170.000.000 50% $671.099 164   $110.000.000 $170.000.000 75% $335.549 328   $150.000.000 $210.000.000 0% $1.342.198 112   $150.000.000 $210.000.000 25% $1.006.648 149   $150.000.000 $210.000.000 50% $671.099 224   $150.000.000 $210.000.000 75% $335.549 447     Suggestions by Risk Core Unit @Risk-Core-Unit  proposes to keep Surplus Buffer in a range from minimum 2% to 3% of debt minted from volatile collateral, which is based on their new methodology of calculating Capital at Risk. This puts the proposed Surplus Buffer figure at 90m to 130m from their side. There is also a nice chart on makerburn showing how this has evolved in the past - we have been a lot better on this ratio in the past (we even touched 2.6% very briefly, right now we are back to 1.25%) and we should consider getting to a more healthy level again.  In the long run we should really come up with an IAM for managing the Surplus Buffer, so we don\u2019t have to worry about this anymore. But right now I think that\u2019s the way forward in the short term.  The Signal Request This Signal Request is split in two parts:  To which level do we want to set the Surplus Buffer? Do we want to keep on burning some of the profits?   To which level shall we set the Surplus Buffer?  Pros:  if the system goes underwater, fewer MKR will be flopped as the higher System Surplus can cover more bad debt enables us to more risk oriented behaviour - more aggressive debt ceilings, more risk taking collateral onboarding   Cons:  as long as the System Surplus is lower than the Surplus Buffer, we will not be burning MKR DAI in the System Surplus is DAI taken out of circulation (not a big issue, the supply side is elastic due to the PSMs)  Please vote on ALL options you would support in an onchain-poll.     60 MM (no change) 90 MM (+30 MM) 130 MM (+70 MM) 170 MM (+110 MM) 210 MM (+150 MM) Abstain     0 voters      Shall we increase the Surplus Buffer slowly so we keep burning a fraction of the profits? This is a bit tricky. With the current setup we cannot have something like \u201cuse 25% of burning and put 75% into the System Surplus\u201d. What we can do right now is to slowly linearly increase the Surplus Buffer over time. We would need to set the angle of this slow increase according to the forecasted profit/time. As the lerp will be configured on an absolute number over time I rather ask for an absolute number for increasing over time instead of asking for a percentage. However, assuming the next SF-increase passes onchain, we will likely have a profit of 1.3 MM per week (source). If we want to go for a slow increase of the Surplus Buffer, those options might make sense  set SF to new level directly (no burn) increase the Surplus Buffer by 1 MM per week (leaving ~25% for burning) increase the Surplus Buffer by 0.67 MM per week (leaving ~50% for burning) increase the Surplus Buffer by 0.33 MM per week (leaving ~75% for burning)  based on this calculation. Please note that the actual % cannot get guaranteed, as we would basically just calculate the end-date before adding it to the exec - if we accrue a lot of more fees than expected the burn-ratio will go up, if we accrue less, the ratio will go down (maybe even to 0). Also noteworthy, as it happened during Wild Wednesday: if we want to keep on burning a bit of the profit, a large wave of good running liquidation will result in a lot of liquidation penalties directly going into burning as it overflows the Surplus Buffer.  Pros:  we will keep burning some MKR while we also increase the Surplus Buffer   Cons:  it takes longer for the Surplus Buffer to get filled  Please vote on ALL options you would support in an onchain-poll.     set target level directly - no burning increase Surplus Buffer by 1 MM per week increase Surplus Buffer by 0.67 MM per week increase Surplus Buffer by 0.33 MM per week Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Poll will run until 2021-11-19T14:00:00Z; its outcome will result in an on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary.

Most of the cryptosphere now understands the value of burning.   Not burning is bad PR  The non-burning of MKR seems to be brought up a lot in the community outside of this forum (i.e. subreddit). If we keep pausing burning for long stretches of time, people will lose confidence in our intent or ability to burn.   Burning is investing in ourselves  If we burn MKR but need the capital later, we can just mint and sell MKR at that time (at presumably higher prices). While minting MKR to raise capital might be bad PR, at least we can communicate at that time why we need the capital.    ",

This puts the proposed Surplus Buffer figure at 90m to 130m from their side.   Let me be clear that I am not against partial burning of MKR, but for obvious reasons (I represent Risk Core Unit after all) we prefer a more appropriate sized Surplus Buffer. I do think that burning MKR can impact the price of MKR positively, but mostly because of potentially positive PR. In any case, partial burning should have a positive effect one way or another and it does help us with our capital backstop: if MKR burning stimulates MKR price and liquidity it helps Maker in potential debt auctions. So I\u2019d probably prefer 30m increase and 25% burning because it both has benefits in terms of capital robustness. ",

I think in general the negative reputation being gained by prolonged time between burns is underappreciated. When I first got into MKR the elevator pitch was that it was a coin that was generating revenue and ensuring payout by burning itself. I was really happy to see that pitch come into fruition this spring and disappointed when it stopped as suddenly as it started. Now I recognize that was a function of the parameters put into the compromise of a partial burn at that time, but I think seeing the burn start and then stop again turned a lot of aspiring MKR fans away from this project and over onto something else without a tarnished reputation. Disregarding risk-assessment seems ill advised but so does raising the surplus buffer once again just as burn seems within reach. MKR is a coin with low liquidity and thus high volatility. I fully expect such a disappointment in the eyes of many low level investors to have pronounced effect on MKR price. MKR in general has a high bar of entry and I think we should be careful to scare of new blood once again. ",

The current annual profit estimate on makerburn is 1.4% of the current level of DAI minted from non-stable coins. If the Surplus Buffer was set to reach a target of somewhere between 2% and 3%, with no partial burning, it would take about 1.5 - 2 years before every new DAI minted started contributing to the burning. And with the current level of stability fees, as long as there is positive growth in DAI minted from non-stable coins, there would actually be no burning at all. I therefore believe that a dynamic target (a percentage suggested by the risk team) combined with partial burning during the build up to the target would be the best way to go. This would of course lead to a higher gap between the System Surplus and the Surplus Buffer in periods with growth, which should be taken into consideration when setting the partial burning level, but at least then we would secure some level of burning during periods of growth. Btw, I am definitely not saying that 2-3% is wrong or too conservative (I choose to trust the risk team here), but I justed wanted to point this out. ",

Risk-Core-Unit has already provided a minimum level which are choosing to not follow. Can Risk-Core-Unit share how they sized the minimum 2-3% Capital Surplus range (measured versus debt minted from volatile collateral)?  What are the key assumptions in this analysis?  What are the downsides if we do not maintain at least these levels? Maker has a highly leveraged balance sheet where a capital surplus and liquidity are typically used to protect the balance sheet in stressed times.  And the capital surplus and liquidity are sized to deal with the risks in the balance sheet - credit risk in assets, liquidity risk in DAI\u2026 Its great to be able to burn profits to buy back MKR, but if Maker blows up due to credit/liquidity/insolvency risk, we all know what the value of MKR will be:       ZERO My rough sense of Maker\u2019s mission is as follows: Maximize DAI outstanding such to the constraint that Maker doesnt blow up along the way from key risks such as liquidity, credit and solvency.

The previous signal was started at the beginning of September, it\u2019s now the beginning of November. The DAI supply has increased by ~33% since then, as we\u2019ve gone from ~6B to 8B, further as people have noted the ratio of surplus to risk-DAI is lower. If circumstances change significantly, that is a reason to present options to vote, once again. That said, I do think it would be preferable to approach this in a more durable way. We could vote on a percentage to try to maintain, or vote on a desired rate-of-increase for the buffer. In an ideal world, I think we\u2019d have an instant access module to change the buffer according to some set of rules predetermined by governance. ",

Point here is that whilie everyone wants to burn MKR I think it would be prudent to tie DSSVest funding directly to MKR being bought by the flapper, and basically lerp burn some fraction of that MKR depending on protocol needs. Either that or we could just accumulate all flapped MKR in DSSVest and have governance decide whether/when to burn from that contract or to simply add a lerp kind of MKR burn function there. This kind of thinking basically eliminates MKR minting for DSSVest, and ties MKR compensation to the protocol being profitable and lerp flapping for MKR to fund DSSVest.    Then DSSVest basically pays out what is has accumulated as a ratio of what it has to what is requested. ",

This decision is key to the risk appetite and policy of Maker.  One can argue building capital surplus is really building the business (#2).   All three are valid (and competing) uses of profits. In a typical finance company the CEO, CFO and CRO will be very focused on capital allocation , return on invested capital and overall capital efficiency.  And the board of directors will be involved overseeing these key key issues. In general building Maker for rapid growth requires reinvesting more capital in the business (and capital surplus) and burning less MKR. ",

Like  People will lose confidence MKR price will go to zero  We can all agree that MKR has underperformed other defi projects and have left a lot of innovation that should have come from it, untapped. At the same time there are price fluctuations and erosion of trust. And I don\u2019t use the last sentence lightly. In my opinion project has become too detached from the MKR token. And there\u2019s an urgent need to bring it back in that direction to some degree. Also the capital allocation, ceo bit is also worth digging into. MKR is not Circle or Tether. And that\u2019s the differentiating factors of DAI and the reason many prefers it. In a nutshell. Project has gone too far from MKR and it should get tied up to it and start burning soon. Risk team needs more compelling arguments then being alarmist. If there\u2019s a crash and system is working as expected i.e. for MKR are printed then that\u2019s not a bad thing. Bad situation is if people lose trust in MKR and stop using DAI. ",

This proposal has options to burn some % of the increasing Surplus (25%, 50%, 75%)  ofc the 0% option is increase the surplus buffer and burn NO Maker doing it. Personally since the DAO has already approved MKR CU compensation via DSSVest I think we should start now to take the MKR slated for the flapper to act as input funding for DSSVest.   For now I am ok with a moderate burn component as the surplus buffer increases.  It is the simplest way to connect NET DAI profits to a moderate MKR burn component while we build the surplus. FYI:   Before Black Thursday Maker has a SB of like 500K to 1M with maybe 100-150M outstanding or less than 1% of outstanding at the time and a loss event of 4% of outstanding costing the protocol 6M.  If this were to happen today it would be 320M with a 60M backing buffer leaving a 260M hole to be filled by selling MKR. There are many reasons we want to increase the surplus buffer, a loss component is only one of them.  The other is that if Maker ends up needing to reduce fees reducing income we still have to pay for CUs and would rather do this by using a surplus than minting MKR.   Right now we have a surplus buffer that probably has 1-1.5yrs of CU expenditures. ",

These are generally the people that understand the project the least, I\u2019m sure that many of them would prefer to use the entire surplus buffer to burn tokens just to try and pump their bags but doing so would leave the protocol exposed to a negative credit event and would threaten to take down the entire DeFi ecosystem.     makerburn:  Burning is investing in ourselves  If we burn MKR but need the capital later, we can just mint and sell MKR at that time (at presumably higher prices).    The only time we\u2019ve minted is at the lowest all-time prices. There is zero reason to believe this will be any different in the future, especially if MKR holders vote to burn while we\u2019re in the midst of a bull market. We had burned nearly 15K tokens before Black Thursday and then had to mint nearly 21K to cover bad debt due to an inadequate Surplus Buffer. If we had a sufficient Surplus Buffer, zero MKR would\u2019ve been minted we could\u2019ve used the excess funds to purchase MKR at all-time lows. Instead, we bought hit and sold low. If the bull market continues, we could literally be in the same exact position we were right before Black Thursday in less than a month.  image750\u00d71334 145 KB  A year and a half later and it appears we still haven\u2019t learned our lesson. It is crazy to me that we are still making surplus buffer / burn decisions based on signal requests rather than defined risk parameters such as the leverage and CET1 ratios. Based on the current votes, it looks like the community is proposing to ignore our risk experts and proceed with trying to pick pennies up in front of a steamroller despite having a Surplus Buffer as a % of risk-weighted assets at 1.11% and falling by the day.  image1075\u00d7793 45.7 KB  Circling back to Black Thursday - please see below for a brief summary of what would\u2019ve happened if we had prioritized raising and filling the Surplus Buffer rather than burning MKR:  We burned approximately 15K MKR tokens prior to Black Thursday at an average price of around $500 per MKR, only to turn around and mint 21K at half the price following Black Thursday. If MKR holders decided to let all funds flow to the Surplus Buffer prior to BT, instead of having to mint 21K tokens and dilute the supply to 1.006M, the Surplus Buffer would\u2019ve covered all existing bad debt and we would\u2019ve had the option to start burning MKR at a much lower price. If the price still fell to $250 per MKR (it may not have since there would be no additional supply hitting the market), we would\u2019ve been able to burn nearly 9K tokens, more than has been burned nearly two years later. Last point I\u2019ll make is regarding real world assets. The Surplus Buffer is one of the factors that dictates the size of real world assets that can be onboarded - a lower SB limits the size of deals we can do and therefore is an impediment to growth.

I\u2019m not so sure this is true if it can attract new people to participate in the community. A bit anecdotal, but I was personally attracted to Maker because of the burn mechanic. Without the burn, there would be no makerburn.     Aes:  These are generally the people that understand the project the least   This may be true, but people who don\u2019t understand the project well are also the pople we need to draw in somehow to grow the DAO. Barrier of entry to MakerDAO is high.     Aes:  If we had a sufficient Surplus Buffer, zero MKR would\u2019ve been minted we could\u2019ve used the excess funds to purchase MKR at all-time lows.   If we predicted BT ahead of time, then yes, we could have applied this strategy. BT was a black swan event and those are generally hard to predict. The next black swan to give us a headache may very well be completely unrelated to system surplus/deficit and may also not be preventet by a large buffer. In my view, the primary problem of BT was an underdeveloped ecosystem around liquidations and bots that went offline. Without that problem, we might have escaped BT without any bad debt at all. Liquidations 2.0 have since been rolled out, and no bad debt has been created after, even during the violent pullback of May (when liq 2.0 was just rolled out with little time to mature) and aggressive pullback of September. As for missed oppertunities, we could also point to large stretches of time last fall when we did not burn any tokens at ~$500 or just recently when we did not burn at ~$2500. Then there is the missed oppertunity of several tens of millions of DAI sitting in effectively a zero-interest account during a time of extremely high inflation. Keeping a large surplus is not free risk mitigation. My preferred strategy is to always burn at least some amount of MKR and also fill the buffer. We\u2019ll burn some highs, we\u2019ll burn some lows, but as long as we keep growing this should even out and give us fair prices in the long run. ",

Absolutely agree, and I also believe that a large part of the bad PR could be avoided with a more long term and transparent burn strategy. Now a lot of MKR holders get disappointed because there is a new signal request every time we are close to a new round of burning. For people with limited knowledge of the project this might seem suspicious. The above is the main reason I voted for levels below the target suggested by the risk team in this poll. If a more long term and dynamic strategy was presented, I would definitely vote in favour of that. I would also love to see the main aspects and assumptions of the risk team\u2019s analysis to reach the recommended ratios. Personally I also hope such a strategy would include some level of burning on the way up to the set target ratios just to secure some level of burning during growth periods. Yes, it is a bit more risky, but as @makerburn points out it will help to diversify the purchase price of MKR burned, help increase the MKR liquidity and hopefully also have a good PR effect. ",

We may not get a second chance if sh!t really hits the fan. Just to be clear, I\u2019m pro-burning but my views are how I see us maximizing the quantity of tokens that can be burned over the long-run. The more collateral we can safely onboard now, the more we can burn later. We should really have a MIP that defines minimum risk levels prior to burning. Since @Risk-Core-Unit recommends 2-3% of risk-weighted assets, we could have a SB target at 2.5% then anything over that is burned. Since the lending markets are extremely volatile, we can spend less Governance time rehashing the same pro/con arguments for raising the SB/burning every time our risk weighted assets spike. ",

Maker has a vision and plenty of funds, but we lack both a strategy for how to get there and any form of long-term planning. In any normal organization, you would have investment proposals.   I have previously proposed that Risk CU should come up with a formula for the Surplus Buffer and then we stick to that to avoid a steady stream of signal requests on the subject. I now realize this was a mistake since Risk will always work to increase buffers and so cannot make what is ultimately a political decision. What part of surplus funds goes where will have to be decided by a MIP.   ",

When something is copied by no other team in crypto you might want to reconsider. Instead of trying to increase the Surplus Buffer we could just vote to disable the Burner until a replacement is found if the community has lost faith in it as a method of returning value to MKR holders.   I think this deserves it\u2019s own discussion because I think the burn mechanism is an integral part of Makers value proposition, and I\u2019m certain I\u2019m not the only one judging by numerous Reddit threads. I do agree however that it deserves to be enshrined in an actual policy and not being left up to signal requests that pop up at random intervals. I happen to agree with SCV that the burn method is a bread and butter method from the financial world in returning value to investors. I think the biggest difference between MKR and other crypto assets is that unlike the majority, MKR is actually turning a profit. I fully recognize that risk needs to be managed but I think it is also wise to take a step back and look at the bigger issue. Why do we need to manage risk? We need to manage it to maintain credibility. Users of DAI needs to trust that the value of 1 DAI is more or less equal to $1. In the same vein holders of MKR has to trust that MKR will not lose it\u2019s revenues through mismanagement and lost collateral. What I feel is underappreciated though is the loss of credibility that comes from not delivering on previous promises. Every time you do that you devalue your own credibility. If MKR was a company that in Q1 said that \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a share buyback in Q4\u201d they would tank their stockprice if they in Q4 instead chose to kept the profit in the company as liquidity reserves. This means that there are other risks to manage than systemic or financial risks. There are good reasons to have and to grow the Surpluss buffer, but I think it has to be done as a balance with regards to burning some of the profits. It is not uncommon for an organization to have competing goals for its resources and then one need to come up with a meaningful compromise. If anything I think this threat has shown the urgent need to establish a policy on distribution of profits, the level of risk and the size of the surplus buffer and how and when parameters regarding this is going to change. Predictability is a key word in this. ",

Personally, I would go with something like 15%-25% burn fraction and 90-130mm surplus buffer since it would be likely non-contentiously passed \u2192 imo, starting to increase the buffer asap, is the most important thing. There is nothing preventing anyone submitting new MIP to solve this (periodical) problem systematically. I would imagine large holders have strong incentive to do it.

Mainly the need to increase the SB and significantly. My only difference, I think, is how we are currently calculating rwa. In my understanding we actually should be using the official BIS percentages for asset risk weights, rather than coming up with our own. In that case, our ratio is well below than what we\u2019ve been reporting. Meaning we have much less protection than we think we have. Maybe a first step is to maintain clear and transparent documentation on risk weights for each single asset in Maker. Then a second step is to come up with a regulatory capital calculation first (standardised approach), before going on doing our own economic capital calculation. ",

I think we should focus on slowly increasing fees until we see material pushback from the market.

Some Key Observations : (1)  Maker has a leveraged balance sheet where A.  Liabilities are basically demand deposits pegged to the US $ B.  Assets include loans over-collateralized by crypto assets CBL), other stable coins, and a small amount of RWA (2)  Maker needs to understand, measure and manage the risks in both its liabilities and assets. Maker\u2019s key balance sheet risks including the following. (3)  Key Liability Risks A.  Liquidity risk:  Maker does not have sufficient liquid assets to enable DAI holders to convert back to US $ as desired, particularly when many DAI holders want out quickly (4) Key Asset Risks A.  Credit risk:  assets do not receive all their contractual cashflows due to default by counterparties B.  Crypto Currency/Liquidation Risk:  The crypto collateral backing the CBL falls so quickly in price that the Maker Keepers cannot liquidate under collateralized vaults at sufficient prices to cover the CBLs. C.  Interest Rate Risk:  market interest rates move against Maker\u2019s interest rate sensitive assets (for liabilities), devaluing them. D.  Currency Risk:  currency rates move against Maker\u2019s currency sensitive assets (or liabilities), devaluing them (5).  Capital Surplus:  this is a prudent reserve that helps Maker manage the Key Risks, including the ones listed above.  A reasonable Capital Surplus Policy requires that Maker be able to understand and measure its risks! ",

And understand the risks involved. If there was no burn mechanism MKR price would never have reached to levels that it had. Does your figures make sense if MKR was always a sub $100 token and no one was using DAI? I am sorry to say but MKR is on the wrong trajectory. And it will either get forked or DAI will get replaced by another more focused group. Risk team really need to get their act together and get this project tied to the MKR token. The classic mistake of thinking \u201cthings will always be the same\u201d is being made here on a monumental level. Without the MKR token, this project is just another blockchain webapp. There are many like that and lives of such projects is not long. It\u2019s fairly obvious that incentives are misaligned. And if MKR needs to succeed and take a further growth leap, it needs to become more blockchain ethos focused. Last edit: if the team is really so inclined. Please do make an announcement to detach this project from MKR token and have it delisted from exchanges. DAI will go with it.

It\u2019s polarizing, as we can see, and I think it\u2019s worth it to consider a pro-burn \u201ccounter offensive\u201d or an attempt at striking a more appealing compromise. Can we at least wait with rushing this through until the MKR price goes up? Right now is a fantastic time to go full burn - but once MKR starts going up burning will be a lot worse and hoarding cash will be a much better option. But instead it seems like the community wants us to hoard USD when the MKR price is low and then start burning when MKR is topping. The worst possible way to use the buy and burn tokenomics\u2026 AES, our resident internal finance specialist, recently released a valuation model that priced MKR at 6000. Pro-burners could consider using a signal request to prevent cash hoarding significantly below that price (personally I\u2019d say anything below 5000 is cheap assuming AES\u2019 model holds). If there\u2019s support for this I\u2019d be happy to push on this front. Additionally, I think there\u2019s a possibility that this poll is biased towards anti burn since that is the implied \u201cyes\u201d option, and we might do better in a signal request where \u201cpro burn\u201d is the implied yes option.

While there may be bias on behalf of the author, I don\u2019t think this is reflected in the choice to make the implied yes the \u2018anti-burn\u2019 option. Ideally the implied \u2018yes\u2019 should always be the change from the current state of affairs, which I strongly suspect is how @ultraschuppi approached this. If we leave things alone, do nothing, make no change, then we end up burning. If we change things, do something, make a change to the parameter, then we end up not burning (or burning less.) It makes sense to me for the \u2018yes\u2019 option to always be the option that advocates for a positive action, and for the \u2018no\u2019 option to be the current status-quo. I think to have the opposite convention, or to have a convention where this flips randomly, would be confusing and generally a bad time.  That said, all the points you made about trying to solve this in a more durable fashion make a lot of sense to me. It would be great if we could determine a policy for burn versus buffer such that we don\u2019t have to vote and  rehash the same arguments every few months. ",

IMO it is actually fine that there is always a bit of bias in a signal request (although it should of course be minimized as much as possible, which I also think it is here), because they are all about individuals bringing forth ideas about taking initiative and taking action. In the end MKR holders will have the final say no matter what so it\u2019s not a failure if something contentious goes through the SR process. My point is that given how close this vote is regarding partial burn vs no/minimal burn, it might be advantageous for the pro-burners to try with a different signal request that can somewhat counter the worst negative outcome from this signal request (not burning at very low prices) - specifically by linking price to how surplus buffer increases are implemented Side comment: This is always how I believe burn should be done, buy low sell high and all that - an automated approach to valuation model-linked burning is described in the Ember design in my original Sagittarius tokenomics post, and I\u2019ll post an even more advanced and powerful version of it soon in my v2 tokenomics documents.

The issue is two fold   Undervalued and overvalued are arbitrary. It\u2019s hard for MKR holders to be neutral and recognize when the token is overvalued.   The buffer exists to safeguard against high-risk events. It is most likely going to get wiped out when something goes wrong with the protocol e.g. on Black Thursday. We\u2019ve talked about how it\u2019s unlikely to happen again but there\u2019s always going to be the risk of unknown unknowns - that\u2019s what the SB is for! Such a black swan event is also precisely when the price of MKR will crash. So what do you do when MKR hits rock bottom and the SB gets wiped out? When this happened on Black Thursday, we chose to rebuild the buffer quickly while still burning - a very good middle ground. Now, if things go well with the protocol, the price of MKR should keep going up so there\u2019s never a good moment to raise the SB. You\u2019d always want as much burned now as possible - which is what many are advocating in this thread.   I think the right way to think about this is to look at the broader crypto market. I\u2019m going to ignore RWA assets for this analysis since the rate at which they will scale is unclear at the moment. Do we think that ETH and BTC will ever dip below their current price in the future? Personally, I think yes - the next bear cycle will result in cheaper prices than what we\u2019re seeing right now. Despite MKR being undervalued in ETH terms, I think it\u2019s still likely that we will see cheaper MKR in terms of DAI in the next bear cycle as well. This paragraph is finger-in-the-wind so I\u2019m curious if people agree with this sentiment. If you do agree with the preceding paragraph, then our way forward is pretty clear. When the broader crypto market goes into a bear cycle, DAI generated from crypto assets is going to be lower. If the protocol doesn\u2019t suffer any black swans, the SB will be much larger as a percentage of outstanding DAI than it needs to be. In my opinion that is the moment to decrease the SB and burn MKR - we\u2019d burn more MKR than we would by burning now and Risk will be happy to allow a decrease in the SB. ",

The broader crypto market is difficult to predict and I\u2019m sure many would just as much say this bull cycle has much more room to run.  But based on how mkr has performed relative to the market recently and fundamental financial metrics, I imagine most would say it\u2019s at least fairly valued even when adjusted for risk.  I also imagine there\u2019s a point where the majority would say the price is more than fairly valued.  Perhaps you can automatically slow burning and increase SB more quickly when at or near all time/52 week highs (even if the highs are justifiable by growth). Your point about reducing the surplus buffer in market downturns is a good one if executed well.  However, there\u2019s an element of trust required with the surplus buffer.  Since expenses are taken from it, there will always be a temptation to use it for more or continued spending rather than burns even when good opportunities arrive.  If you can maintain profitability during downturns, the decision is easier but that might mean reducing expenses which is difficult and contentious. ",

When I explain the MKR/DAI structure to a corporate-finance-savvy-but-crypto-newbie colleague, unanimously one of the moments in the conversation in which their eyes open wider in wonder is when I explain that after a certain amount of profit is generated that profit in the DAI stablecoin is automatically used to buy back MKR and then that MKR is burned.

If you look at price history of MKR, you can see that burning has had no to little impact on the token price. It really only starts to have an impact when annual cash flow is > 5% of the market cap which seems to be a floor value for the MKR token. The faster our cash flow grows and the higher it gets, the more MKR tokens we can burn. When I think about allocating capital, I strongly believe investing more in engineering and real world assets will significantly outperform buying back and burning MKR at today\u2019s prices. ",

When a company is making money that it does not have the present opportunity to use that profit in a way that will give the shareholder a healthy return, it is the smart call to distribute it to the shareholder as either a dividend or share buyback, like $AAPL.  As you read this and I said \u201cin 3 seconds tell me what we can put 60 MM DAI into use today that will likely bring in a healthy return\u201d what would that be?  If I was answering I would shrug my shoulders. Marketing and engineering budgets certainly could be bolstered but would be just throwing DAI away at that level, and we don\u2019t need it to expand DAI use and lending.  Which goes to the other nuance - and a beauty of the protocol \u2013 that new opportunities do not require a bunch of cash/DAI sitting around but will be created upon doing the secured loan, unlike a bank or corporation.

                    "content": "Edit: @prose11 definitely stole my thunder here Certainly. I\u2019m afraid this explanation will end up involving some minutiae of the Governance process so if you have any follow-up questions feel free to ask. First, let me start by pointing out that since that post was made there has been a redistribution of votes and the following 2 options are now above the 50% threshold for inclusion in the on-chain poll:  Increase Surplus Buffer by 0.67 MM per week Increase Surplus Buffer by 1 MM per week  A crucial aspect of the Signal Request process is that not all of the options offered to community members for voting in the forum will make it into the on-chain vote. Conventionally, we have used a cut-off of 50% of non-abstain votes to decide if an option is included in an on-chain vote or not. Remember that people can vote for more than one option so it is possible for more than one option to attract the votes of more than 50% of participants. In this instance, we have the ability to submit on-chain polls using instant-runoff voting rather than our usual plurality voting (FPTP) method. Of course, we need to know what will happen if no options cross the 50% threshold. In that instance, we would consider the Signal Request to be in favour of the status quo. Once it was realised today that none of the options in this poll in favour of slow increases to the Surplus Buffer (lerp) had above 50% of non-abstain votes we realised there might be a problem with this particular Signal Request. This is because it is the position of GovAlpha that the status quo for Surplus Buffer increases is to increase directly to the new Surplus Buffer. Lerping the Surplus Buffer is an active decision that Maker Governance must make rather than a default assumption. So in essence, this Signal is asking several questions:  Should we increase the Surplus Buffer? What size do we want the Surplus Buffer to be?  The default position here is \u201cno, we should not increase the Surplus Buffer\u201d, so if no options passed 50% the Signal would not proceed to on-chain, currently 2 options in favour of increasing the Surplus Buffer have above 50% of non-abstain votes so would proceed to an on-chain vote.  Should we lerp the Surplus Buffer increase? What rate should we lerp the Surplus Buffer at?  The implication of this question is that it is not automatic that the Surplus Buffer increase is lerped. Clearly, in this particular Signal Request, there are more people in favour of lerping the Surplus Buffer than not lerping it. However, there was not a consensus on what this rate should be. We realised that this may result in an outcome that had actually received the fewest votes (no burn/lerp) being the option that proceeded to an on-chain vote as this was considered the status quo option. If the poll was to end and an on-chain poll proceed without a lerp option then Governance participants may rightly be confused or frustrated. Consequently, we decided to post both on the Forum and on Discord to highlight this discrepancy to voters. As things currently stand in this Signal Request an on-chain poll will likely be an instant-runoff vote with 6 options:  Abstain Increase Surplus Buffer to 90 million, with a gradual increase of 0.67 million per week Increase Surplus Buffer to 130 million, with a gradual increase of 0.67 million per week Increase Surplus Buffer to 90 million, with a gradual increase of 1 million per week Increase Surplus Buffer to 130 million, with a gradual increase of 1 million per week No change to Surplus Buffer  For what it\u2019s worth, from a personal perspective I am not sure that the potential for the lowest scoring option to proceed on-chain is a desirable outcome for a Signal Request and I will be bringing this up at the weekly GovAlpha CU meeting next Monday as something we might need to provide clarity on moving forwards.

For what it\u2019s worth, from a personal perspective I am not sure that the potential for the lowest scoring option to proceed on-chain is a desirable outcome for a Signal Request and I will be bringing this up at the weekly GovAlpha CU meeting next Monday as something we might need to provide clarity on moving forwards.  This is what struck me as odd and I think should be investigated further. I think the situation could have been avoided if the signal request had been broken down into the four questions in your post. I think the problem originates in having several options that are essentially degrees of a preferred solution. In most cases you\u2019d expect to have opinions fall along a spectrum with some overlap, depending on the overlap you might very well end up in a situation where there is consensus for a direction but fragmentation in magnitude. In such a case I think it makes sense to do an instant run-off on the magnitude. Another aspect of this particular signal request is that the second question is dependent on the first. It doesn\u2019t make sense to restrict the growth of the surplus buffer if you\u2019re against raising it in the first place. This can lead to a portion of voters voting \u201cabstain\u201d in the second poll because they didn\u2019t find an option for \u201cIncrease Surplus Buffer by 0 per week\u201d. Your choice in the second poll can also change if the assumption is that there is going to be an increase vs. there isn\u2019t going to be one. It\u2019s a secondary kind of vote. To exemplify: My initial stance is that there isn\u2019t going to be an increase so I abstain the second vote. However, upon learning that there is going to be an increase, I might prefer the surplus buffer to either be filled quickly or more gradually. A second example. I initially prefer an increase of 130MM, but on learning that there might not be an increase without consensus I might prefer 30M over nothing even though I think that is way too low. In both cases I think it makes sense to separate the principle from the magnitude. First do a vote whether to increase or not, and then do a vote on how much under the condition that there is going to be an increase. Secondly do a vote on whether there shall be a gradual increase in the surplus buffer or not and then do a vote on how gradual that change should be under the condition that it is going to be gradual. Both the dependent votes would naturally lend themselves to instant run-off votes. ",

                    "content": "The poll is over and the discussion has been thorough, but I want to throw in my two cents. As investors in MakerDAO, the two major categories of risk we must consider are:  Risk of permanent loss of capital Risk of lower than expected returns on investment.  MakerDAO\u2019s ultimate long term success is extremely dependent on preserving the reputation of the Dai and it\u2019s peg. Keeping a strong Supply Buffer will allow us to avoid permanent loss of capital by preventing MKR being minted at the worst possible time, and will also safeguard the reputation Maker governance, which is the widest moat Maker can have. However, burning MKR when it is undervalued will greatly mitigate the risk of lower than expected returns. I propose the following heuristic: Rule #1: As long as the Supply Buffer is below the risk mitigation sweet spot, some revenue must be directed towards growing the supply buffer. Rule #2: As long as MKR is undervalued, some  revenue must be used to burn MKR. I conjecture that a 90/10 or 10/90 split in any case will perform better over the long run than 0/100 or 100/0. Calibrating the split, the buffer sweet-spot and the valuation of MKR is up to long term governance, but as long as the two rules are followed, I will feel very happy owning Maker for the long run.
