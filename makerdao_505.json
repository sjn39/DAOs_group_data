                    "content": "@Adam_Skrodzki has suggested some interesting changes to how we use polls to create executive votes which are worth discussing in more detail. Current Implementation With thanks to @psybull: when the MakerDAO governance polling system signals for some change, it does not automatically change the the system. Instead, the outcome from the poll is crafted into a proposal with a spell , which is a contract deployed to the blockchain that, when cast , will do the magic necessary to update the system (if it is chosen as the hat using the Executive functionality). Proposal Currently, each change begins life as a new poll. Adam\u2019s suggestion is instead to have continuous polls for each parameter which do not expire. Instead of taking the result of each new poll, creating a spell based on it, and then submitting it to the Chief so that it may become the hat, we instead specify some predefined timePeriod for each poll. If the poll reflects a result that is different to the current hat at the end of any such period, then a new spell is created and submitted to the Executive portal. If the newly-created Executive Vote is not accepted and the current hat is not replaced, then the next Executive Vote can be constructed based on next snapshot of polls results. There is also the potential to include an actual quorum requirement in continuous polls done in this manner, which would, at least, lower the potential for controversy in any given vote. It is also more in line with the technical implementation of the protocol, which is \u201ccontinuous\u201d anyway, as described in psybull\u2019s post linked above. Potential Benefits This may well be better from a UX perspective, as well as slightly decreasing the governance overhead. Instead of having to monitor the voting portal each week, catch up on calls and keep up-to-date with the forum, I can keep in my head the key factors (as represented by the polls running on vote.makerdao.com) and shift my position as new and relevant information becomes available. It also means that it would be easier to create lasting and useful educational resources for each key parameter. It may mean the wider community could gain the ability to create polls (as people could potentially stake some DAI to create a poll for some parameter they feel is important. Evaluating the inclusion of some parameter is far more doable than vetting random polling submissions, and could be standardised to at least some extent.) If that is not enough to convince you, it would also be easier to keep track of governance changes for each parameter, and do so in the same place as where the votes themselves take place - adding to the ease and educational value of the voting portal and killing many birds with one (continuous stream of) stone(s). Oh, and it would likely be easier to automate a bit (not that that is a huge priority to anyone who doesn\u2019t have their own economic interests in pointing to the current flaws in Maker\u2019s system atm ) One last point: it would mean that it is much easier to distinguish technical/emergency changes from monetary policy (as the former could be instituted as once-off polls) which would be more noticeable to people if they were more used to just seeing continuously available options. Potential Downsides This would likely require a lot of dev work done on the polling section of vote.makerdao.com. I am not familiar with the backend details, so it\u2019s difficult to estimate how many hours exactly. At the very least, it will mean giving the backend the ability to read what the current hat is and acting upon it, which is nontrivial. It would definitely require testing, and I would estimate it in the weeks of good dev work for the entire flow to be built and tested properly. However, given Nikolai\u2019s post, overhauling the polling section in general should likely be bumped up that \u2018priority list\u2019, wherever it is. Open Questions  What are the current key parameters?   SAI SF SAI DC DAI SF DSR Spread DAI DC Not exactly sure where things like the GSM belong in this kind of setup?    What is the best timePeriod for snapshots to be taken and turned into potential Executive Votes?   Probably a bunch of other things this noob doesn\u2019t even know he doesn\u2019t know. Like, for instance, the fact that there is a site at chief.makerdao.com and a good article by Nikolai which goes deeper into why the UI in total should be overhauled\u2026   ",

Actually some of them I did not even took under account before (like parameter history extraction). I think that timePeriod should be set to current frequency of new executives (7 days), but also that it should be subject to vote for change. One note, that currently there is no direct DSR vote, there is DSR Spread instead, Also. Personally I think we should have similar Yes/No polls about features like GSM but would love to hear counter arguments. ",

I\u2019ve not thought a huge amount about this yet, but for those that have: Are there any obvious downsides? Anything less obvious? What work needs to be done to make this happen?

Which are mostly a good deal of dev work, some of which would be non-trivial. Maybe I\u2019m too biased here though, so more than willing to hear other opinions about why this would be bad to do. Of course, the other benefit is that as discussions about BAT SF vs ETH SF etc etc grow, this way of doing things scales better, in terms of attention specifically. If we\u2019re struggling for voter involvement now, and there are only 2 collateral types, then when we really have multiple, it\u2019s gonna be a really big problem to have polls running as they currently do. Takes me back to my point about continuous polls and how they allow us to collate docs, educational resources, and governance history all in one place, from which you can also take appropriate action.

And even there is slightly smaller overhead since as it is today ever week there must be someone who creates new polls. Maybe little thing to be aware of is that for example in polls like SF you need to include all values upfront not change them everytime, but from automated history extraction that is actually advantage. One of interesting downsides (new properties? ) is that if You do not change your vote It stays forever on certain value (what if someone have lost access to his MKR\u2019s?). It can be mitigated by setting limit of time from which votes are being counted (how many blocks in a past) but that is something we should experiment with only if problem of stagnant votes has been proven to be real and important.

It would require some work, which at an initial glance doesn\u2019t seem too extreme. For example, I would consider dev work to; remove the poll end-date, flag at what point a snapshot would be taken (to support 3rd party sites like mkrgov.science), define a quorum threshold, and introduce rules for what level of parameter deviation would be acceptable from current protocol values. The technical side is fairly quantifiable, it\u2019s the social aspect that I\u2019ll let Rich comment on, which I think is a little more complex, for example might we be introducing the problem of building up MKR weights across a distribution of values similar to what we experience in executive votes? I guess we could solve that by introducing vote expiry mechanism (as we\u2019ve discussed for executive voting). ",
