                    "content": "Will you join us for a 100% community-driven experiment? Especially if you are just a user who thinks you don\u2019t have time for understanding OP governance or it\u2019s not worth it to participate, this is your DAO. You don\u2019t need to spend any more time than you can or are motivated to spend. Just support this post or claim the first token distribution it\u2019s a positive contribution. This will pretend to be a fair DAO, perhaps the fairest DAO ever if you join us. As we were discussing on this thread: https://gov.optimism.io/t/babel-optimism-brainstorming-for-language-barrier-inclusion A decentralized global community must emerge from global participation and most of the crypto projects have been biased toward using English for communication. Sure we need a common language to communicate, but that is a handicap for the great majority of the world\u2019s population. Even having a proficient level it\u2019s exhausting to use a language you don\u2019t master. How can something be decentralized without all that people participating? OP collective needs the indispensable inputs of culturally diverse views. The same things happen for normies/no-coiners, people with a digital divide, neurodiversity, etc. We need to count on them for participating in what is supposed to change the world. **We need everyone to share their strengths, values and their Optimism, and love for humanity ** Another important strength of our community is to reduce the possibility of collusion: forming a group including diverse people and settings some rules for claiming the first tokens can probably guarantee the lack of hidden interests of the group. Also, the middleman is one of the main obstacles for society to receive the whole benefit of a service or social goods. People tend to think in in-group and out-group terms, and they are easy targets for their own fellow citizens, that\u2019s why there is a point for an Optimism citizenship, where the information flows properly. A diverse group can control in a better way for bad actors. Since the projects are created from scratch (no matter how tiny would be) we could implement experimental methods to assure cleanness. Our goal is to start educating and experimenting with bottom-up governance models that empower the community. To welcome new users and bring fresh perspectives to the ecosystem. To foster real-world use cases that bring long-lasting benefits. This particular DAO is not about DeFi, but DeFi people who master crypto tools are very welcome to help us with this difficult task. We are applying for a GRANT as a part of this project:    [DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Entangled Optimism mDAOs - Cycle #10 Grants Council       Project name :  Entangled Optimism micro-DAOs. Iteration 1: Babel m-DAO  Author name and contact info  Discord: TheDoctor#9791 | Telegram: @ateneo1 (Other OP collective members may join and participate from the beginning)  I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes, and to any OP collective member who wants to check.  L2 recipient address : TBD  Which Voting Cycle are you applying for? :Phase 1 - Cycle 10  Whic\u2026      Road map:   Get OP community feedback and hope a large amount of diverse OP users member wants to participate. Set up some parameters and establish a deadline to claim the token. If anyone does not fulfill any criteria for the first token distribution, they are invited to our official forums to participate with their feedback and in the next distribution they could get some of the 49% destinate to newcomers on the terms we determined.   After sharing a private questionary (with the claimers so we can start with the experiment). A list of ideas to explore will be created, and lateral thinking and similar methods will be used to start working on it. A Key point is that everyone can express themselves in their own language or in English using a translator or trying their best without being judged. On the contrary, community will support to extract the value of any idea.   Our Governance Token: 5000 Babel token to be minted soon on Optimism. -If we finally get the OP grant, we will hold a 5000 OP treasure* backing every single Babel and delegated to the delegator chosen by Babel. Babel won\u2019t have any liquidity to be on an exchange, but any holder could burn it and ask for the if someone wants to leave the DAO. -If we don\u2019t get the grant. In my case, I will donate at least the Airdrop I received for voting in a DAO on Ethereum (271.83 OP). And if is there good reception some more I bought because I believe in the vision and I have seen some delegates and volunteers here working hard and sharing those values too. So, I know there are more fresh people willing to join this.   **Token distribution will be done in different phases and the exact criteria will be public after any distribution: (with a council chosen judge approval, we won\u2019t get 5k OP for doing nothing woth ** -51% for OP community members: being a discord or discourse member (before the time I publish this post) or being token holders or providing OP liquidity, participating on governance etc. -49% for inviting people outside the OP community chosen in a game theoretical way that provide a guarantee of value and using some mechanism to probably avoid collusion (some randomness in the invitations orders and some rules for proposals TBD). Look for diversity. Minimum % for each language community member. Newcomers to OP ecosystem supporting our project with their ideas, etc.   We may be needing some privacy for strategic reason, avoiding liking of information etc. We\u2019ll figure it out and we\u2019ll share everything at due time or just a trusted agent could check the content.   The idea from Rune\u2019s maker endgame that didn\u2019t occur to us is that, since we need to avoid friction, if is there an important division or conflict about some issue: the working group can split and keep going in parallel with a referee helping to take the best of both approaches to vote. What we do have clear is that we must avoid any friction about politics, religion or even blockchain technology preference Spread the Word and comment in any language you choose, we are babel now.    In this first iteration is a symbolic quantity so we experiment with DAOS backed by OP in their treasure and therefore contributing to governance or any other needs ** Do not forget this is a social experiment who is going to born in Optimism because we loved the OP collective vision and their working constitution: Working Constitution of the Optimism Collective Note: How about sybil attacks? Token rewards will be distributed for valuable participation, so if someone is planning on sybil they must participate double for double rewards. Besides that, the rewards are not in the OP token value of the shares, but in the real-world value trapped by frictions, bad agents, third parties, and basically a lack of curated information flowing property.   This is a draft, I need to review it and I hope you help me to improve it. This is not a personal project, I am just the one who was crazy enough to post it. Let\u2019s do it! ",

It is abstract and does not give a complete picture of your ideas. You can say whatever you want in writing. I think the first thing you do is shape the structure, rather than just bringing people in with an idea. I have no idea who you are or what you are trying to do. Please take action, not just write. Retroactive public goods are what they say they are. Past performance and Impact are the benefits. \"  Thanks for your valuable feedback and your time, I very much appreciate it. Let me try to kindly respond to your concerns: This is not a personal project, all who participate have the same rights. That\u2019s why it\u2019s still abstract, we need to be as many as possible and start working as peers. It seems complicated, but in practice, it\u2019ll be more simple. Action is already being taken. I\u2019m minting a token, I\u2019ll send it to all OP community fulfilling the first distribution request (all of you on discord and discourse apply) and we can start working on concrete things right away. Optimism is not only about retroactive public goods. Quoting the working constitution: they aim to \u201cthe foundation for a fair, democratic model of decentralized governance that\u2019s built to last.\u201d It is a very difficult problem to solve, we all know the crypto story: A beautiful narrative of freedom and decentralization ending up with people losing money as Fiat pattern repeats. (It\u2019s not easy to change our mindset) W. Constitution stays later: \u201cA commitment to experimentation. In its lifetime, the Collective will undertake a series of governance experiments\u201d We are part of the collective as token holders (no matter how many), so it would be great to experiment ourselves. As the most important part of a democracy, we smallholders (most common users/citizens) have much to say about a governance model, since Thanks for your valuable feedback and your time. Let my try to claryfy the idea: Optimism is not only about retroactive public goods.

As the most important part of democracy: smallholders (common people) have to be aware that we are not in a FIAT world. We must feel with power to participate in a governance model which is becoming more centralized as this is gaining complexity and size. Complex systems are not planned in some Foundation Desk, they emerge from the elements interacting with each other. I\u2019m not here to complete a quest and wait for a pump or a miracle. I\u2019m here to use crypto as it was designed to be used. We don\u2019t need any funds. We have our wallets and we have tools to use them to coordinate. Even though we have the right to fork: And I truly love this part of the constitution, because is what would happen in a decentralized scenery:  \" * Forking. The right to fork and the right to exit are critical to protect individual freedoms. It\u2019s expected and encouraged that if the governance of the Optimism Collective is captured, members of the Collective fork the system and reinstate a new Collective which better serves the people. All of the core software and tooling required to run the Optimism network should be made open source, freely available, and easy to use such that a fork is always a viable alternative.  ",

Aren\u2019t they? Do you read any feedback? Do you know of the Nudge concept? There are no people participating in governance feedback, we are proposing a way (perhaps it won\u2019t work, but what\u2019s the problem in trying?)     diligit:  This does not imply active participation of new people in the OP governance. That\u2019s what delegates are for, and that\u2019s how delegation works.   OP governance or even delegating can\u2019t be a full-time job or even a part-time job. With this we are inviting anyone to join and they may find a particular area of interest where share some value. People will participate more if they don\u2019t need to spend 3 weeks to get the governance process and can join to some m-dao or project of their interest. And about active participation in the OP governance by retail people, I think previous and much more expensive projects didn\u2019t bring much. Delegates are doing a great job, but people won\u2019t spend time enough getting to know them. Information is not going bottom up, if anyone doesn\u2019t see this it\u2019s because we spend much time educating about tech, economics, etc. and there is an important lack of philosophers, game theoreticians, behavioral scientists, etc.     diligit:  and at the same time, contradictory   It\u2019s not. It\u2019s about inclusion     diligit:  And of course, distributing the BABEL token yourself, for which users must fill out a form, is not an open process.   Who holds worthless tokens from the beginning doesn\u2019t matter. If the distribution process is not transparent and fair enough they\u2019ll be useless. If you read the grant proposal, it says clearly that OP tokens will be held by someone named by the council. I know people usually ask for 100,000 in grants to develop some smart contracts first.     diligit:  no need to create another DAO to be a delegate in the Token House   That wasn\u2019t the purpose of this particular project. But I don\u2019t see the problem anyway. ",

It matters, because in the beginning all tokens are owned by you, they are distributed by you, at your own choice, and the criteria are set by you. Since there is no community around the initiative you promote, you personally will control the treasury address, and you are the Council, BABEL tokens are useless. The only beneficiary in this proposal is you, there is no need for BABEL or OP tokens to educate and involve the community in governance.     TheDoctor:  But I don\u2019t see the problem anyway.   It is a problem, because so far it creates the impression that you create the visibility of supporting these proposals to receive the grant from the GF and delegate these tokens to yourself, here are only personal interests, it is not about the DAO.

I didn\u2019t submit mine (I was going to, but since I decided to stop the iteration it\u2019s better like this).

I don\u2019t know personally any of the holders apart from the discussion about the BABEL project open for anyone to see. It\u2019s funny (but fortunate) because I got more iterations with the Spanish community (although I was aware of not forcing much to avoid bias) and many of them show some support, but none of them submitted their address before the unannounced suspension. I would also send 10 tokens to @diligit (he helped me to see the experiment at this precise moment for the best). To @mozuku who was not supporting the project at this stage, but gave her feedback and deserves to be a part of it. And 10 more to @DRAMA  from the Russian community because we could get over a misunderstood and he gave me good advice. If any of them are interested now or later, I\u2019d suggest sending them the tokens. That\u2019s decentralization. Rest of the Babel Tokens (after thinking about it) I have sent them to @jackanorak (I apologize to him for not asking for permission, I like his view as a delegator and I would like to have his feedback. He\u2019s not involved in any of this and I haven\u2019t had direct contact with him (and he\u2019s not my delegate, so he can speak freely and ask me for gas).

Final feedback: In my opinion, this proposal does not present anything new, it is intentionally structured abstractly, and certain aspects are emphasized that everyone agrees with, such as:     TheDoctor:  A decentralized global community must emerge from global participation   or     TheDoctor:  OP collective needs the indispensable inputs of culturally diverse views.   and yes, just pointing out some social aspects that everyone agrees with, but all the abstract text with terms from psychology, sociology, is intended to prevent most people from analyzing more constructively and objectively, because the author of the proposal obviously knows more, and the ideas emphasized are correct, it means that the proposal is also correct, but not!!! But actually the point of this proposal is the following:   Create a proposal/idea based on social principles like equality. (which are also respected in the OP Collective, there is no need for a derived mDAO just for this value) *Form a community (DAO) around this idea. (BABEL token and airdrop are good solutions for this purpose)  Apply for governance grant.(But already as mDAO, community based on the values) Tokens obtained in the Governance Fund grant are delegated to a new delegate who will represent the interests of the mDAO in the Token House.  Thus a new delegate will be created based on the grant obtained from the Governance Fund, taking into account that other delegates have obtained voting power from the community supporting them, not from the Governance Fund, it is not fair. And finally I repeat once again what I wrote previously:     diligit:  The OP community can delegate to whomever they want, choose a delegate based on their own interests, and they can choose a delegate based on their spoken language, and anyone who wants to be a delegate can simply submit a commitment, no need to create another DAO to be a delegate in Token House.

                    "content": "@TheDoctor I like the idea of this but it needs some heavy improvements to work properly with the existing structure of Optimism. There are many fundamental aspects that are missing causing me to become less interested as time moves forward. I suggest implementing some other mechanisms from the existing governance system in place such as pgf. Does the OP Gov system need more active international members? Yes Can the OP Gov system be improved upon? Yes Will there be another DAO that solves this? Yes Let me tell you I have been digging deep into the systemic issues with less fortunate people being \u201cblackballed\u201d by organizations or networks claiming to provide public goods funding opportunities for others. I am being told about discrimination and exclusion on this 4 hour long recorded Twitter spaces you can listen  here  that most Public Goods establishments are racist and extremely judgmental when it comes to grant applications and providing funding for less unfortunate and underprivileged individuals. I agree  that this is a big issue. One of which I am also willing to tackle with the way our DAO will be structured as you have given me a great idea of how to come up with a solution for all of this!!! ",
