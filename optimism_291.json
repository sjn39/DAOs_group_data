The three core pieces of our ecosystem that we will be launching shortly are the ZZ Exchange, Genesis Zed NFT and ZZ Optimizer. ZZ Exchange focuses on providing a deep liquidity layer while maximizing capital efficiency to enable route-optimized and low-slippage trades for traders. ZZ Finance aims to be a platform of passive revenue, where farmers can safely deposit their assets to generate high yet sustainable idle income on Optimism. ZZ Optimizer aims to secure the deep liquidity layer we attained by incentivizing investors to further lock up their assets in ZZ Finance to achieve our long-term vision as a community. ZZ Finance will also be launching our own Genesis Zed NFT with real utilities as part of our effort to promote common identity and positive consensus within the community. Ecosystem Value Proposition: Project owners often find themselves in a dilemma between offering high returns to attract investors and generating sustainable yield to curb inflation of their native token. Many DeFi projects that offered passive income have failed, others succumbed to \u2018mercenary farming\u2019. These \u2018mercenary farmers\u2019 were at one point like you and I, humble farmers that invested and genuinely believed in certain projects but instead got burned badly. Some hate \u2018mercenary farmers\u2019, but we understand what individuals must do to be responsible for their own assets. The major problems when a protocol offers their native token as reward to back up the high yield are:  These tokens often have no intrinsic value and are not backed by the protocol\u2019s revenue. Investors had no incentives to reinvest, ultimately resulting in a farm and dump cycle. The lack of demand for these high-yield reward tokens quickly led to sell off, price depreciation and uncontrolled token inflation.  Breaking the loop of farm and dump - ZZ Finance aims to solve the issue of real sustainable yield & liquidity, thereby giving our investors reasons to reinvest and stay long-term:  Liquidity providers (LP) will share our trading revenue (0.17%), distributed proportionately based on their share in our pool. Liquidity providers (LP) will receive ZZF reward emission, following a deflationary emission schedule. ZZ Optimizer\u2019s vest & forfeit mechanism which incentivize lock up and reinvestment. veZZF holders hold the governance right to adjust ZZF reward distribution to the liquidity pools through voting. veZZF holders enjoy an increase up to 100% of trading revenue (0.25%), trading rebates, protocol fees, and increased farming boosts based on the amount locked. In preparation to form strategic partnership with other projects to further boost ZZF utility and adoption of ZZ Finance.  Our design offers a capital-efficient and sustainable model of operation for our protocol and investors, to attract and retain liquidity. In our vision, we seek to achieve strong consensus within our community, built around a circular economy model that seeks to maximize value and promote sustainability. Number of OP tokens requested: 300,000 Proposal for token distribution:   Gas & Trade Rebates (30%) 30% (90,000) of our OP allocation will be distributed as gas fee & trade rebates to traders on ZZ Finance. This initiative serves to incentivise traders and encourage trades by partially returning their transactions. The size of the rebate will scale with the amount of veZZF token held by the users. The rebate distributed will be a percentage of the traded amount, and will be fractionalized into OP and our native token ZZF in a predetermined ratio based on trade size. Since the rebate will be a percentage of the traded amount, spamming numerous small transactions will not grant you free tokens.   Liquidity & Governance Incentives (30%) 30% (90,000) of our OP allocation will be used to incentivize liquidity & governance participation for long-term holders. Soft-locking assets and rewards in our vault and locking ZZF in exchange for veZZF supports the health of our protocol by reducing circulating supply, increasing demand and achieving a closed-loop circular economy within the ecosphere. This will thereby result in a reduction in volatility and a positive scaling of ZZF price that benefits the entire ecosphere. In short, these OP tokens will be distributed as boosted rewards for long-term investors that participate in our visionized close-loop circular economy model.   Referral Program (10%) 10% (30,000) of our OP allocation will be distributed as rewards to users that contribute to the growth of ZZ Finance and Optimism via our referral program. When a user successfully invites other users into Optimism and our platform, both users will enjoy a boosted farming reward of up to 2.5% in the form of OP and ZZF coming from our treasury.   Marketing (10%) 10% (30,000) of our OP allocation will be used for marketing campaigns targeted to boost user volume on Optimism, and on ZZ Finance. These include task reward, content creation, marketing programs and promotion by key opinion leaders.   Security & Maintenance (20%) 20% (60,000) of our OP allocation will be used for security services, in terms of audits for our smart contracts and maintenance of protocol security. 20% (60,000 OP) would roughly be converted into 50,000-60,000 USDC, which will be used for future audits and on-chain monitoring services of our protocol. From the quotations we\u2019ve gotten thus far, that would lasts us for about 3-4 audits/services.    We notice there has been confusion about our Development & Maintenance allocation, it seems that it is often assumed as team allocation. To clear doubts, when we said development, we are referring to the audit and security services for our future smart contract and protocol that we will be deploying (We view audits & security services as part of the development process). We have amended this section to Security & Maintenance and added more details to prevent future confusion. Thanks to theenlightened & jackanorak for pointing this out.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? 6 months, subjected to the operation of the protocol. If we experience high adoption and demand of our protocol (e.g. high trade volume), the distribution period will be greatly reduced. After we have exhausted the OP incentives, a portion of our treasury will be allocated to take over the incentive program. How much will your project match in co-incentives?: Our community will be incentivized by our continuous ZZF Reward (80% of total supply), of which it will be partially supported by our treasury when OP incentives becomes exhausted. ZZ Finance is also in preparation to develop & collaborate with other projects to bring in more revenue for our community. Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? Auto-compounding Vault (ZZ Optimizer) will be launched shortly after the ZZ Exchange comes online. Emission in our farm will be largely redirected to ZZ Optimizer, whereby a vest and forfeit mechanism will be introduced. Users can choose to soft-lock their assets in our Vault, for up to 2 years to earn a scaling APR (ZZF + OP) much higher than our Farms. Unlike other protocols whereby their assets become completely inaccessible when locked. ZZ Finance offers flexibility to withdraw their soft-locked assets anytime. When a user decides to withdraw his/her asset prematurely, 70% of the forfeited rewards will be redistributed to the remaining stakers of that pool (DAO 30%). The percentage reward forfeited will scale inversely with the time of maturity (Earlier withdrawal = More reward forfeited). ZZF reward emissions are programmed to run in a deflationary and sustainable manner, meaning its supply growth will be reduced overtime. Our veZZF coming up thereafter, outlined above will lock up even more ZZF, boosting the value of ZZF and the health of our protocol. ",

But we feel that the idea of sacrificing asset mobility for higher reward is too rigid for our liking. So we came up with our soft-lock, vest and forfeit mechanism whereby we still offer a high staking reward, but with added flexibility to withdraw anytime for whatever reasons, and the users will only have part of their reward slashed for forfeiting the agreed locking duration. We also thought it would be better to have these forfeited rewards redistributed to the remaining stakers as added incentives for staying long-term. We foresee a high influx of users into our protocol during our initial launch, of which we aim to retain ~80% of the TVL we achieve through our Vault. The governance incentives is used to assist us as a kickstarter as our Treasury accumulates. As our ecosystem continues to expand and mature, we should see an organic growth in the overall adoption of our protocol. When we become fully self-sufficient, the incentive programs will be taken over by our Treasury. Yes, we are open to share it if the Governance Fund can be used to pay for security and maintenance services. ",

It was stated under Eligible Considerations that the \u2018no sales\u2019 rules include exceptions when OP are used to incentivize usage. I believe security & maintenance services does indeed falls under incentivizing usage. Security & maintenance services such as audits reduces the likelihood of hacks and exploits, thereby increases user confidence, leading to greater adoption of the protocol. Taking reference from other established protocol, they are able to retain high user volume & TVL not because they offer insane returns but rather they are security-centered with minimal risks of exploits. At the heart of it, they take good care of their investors\u2019 funds and in return the investors stay. ",

If they come from the same dev, they should at least allow users to disagree with them, pretend they did not see it, and not delete the proof of auditing post (as it could attract new users to go there). By deleting immediately, it shows they hate the new project and do not want the growth of ZZF \u2192 Proven they are two separate team. 5 This is not surprising, this is in their docs prior to the article long time ago, everyone already knew. Also, it not only airdrop to mmf holders but also OP holders, which contributes to 50% of the total airdrop amount. Similar to pancake swap, I will not complain a project based on similar UI, as I saw this kind of design on many projects already.  ",

But as an everyday investor, I think the best way is to observe, see how mmf team keeps their promise, e.g. building MMA for 8 months, and the product is not attractive, saying giving utility to burrow from early this year, but currently, there\u2019s none, and there are more examples. Simultaneously, observe how ZZF builds, and keeps its promise. If you have doubts, I think it is great, because you and me are just ordinary people who want to support the blockchain and OP, while make some money for a better life, and what we want? We want safe, right? Yeah, there maybe similarities, maybe because they are previous mmf investors, we know that past could have substantial influence to the current. However, I do not think it is fair to judge whether they should get the fund or not. Why? Because from what I believe, when giving funds, we should look at each project with a pair of fresh eyes, and not based on past experiences. I understand your rationale, but on the other hand, as opposed to a straight rejection, why not give the team a little time, let them prove themselves are different to MMF. There\u2019s better solution, such as maybe delaying the submission of the proposal to the next round, or keep monitoring their discord, or telegram. ",

I believe you should sort out all accusations clearly with strong arguments. There\u2019s minimal chance that this proposal go through without sorting this out. Here\u2019s my advice:   Open source your code. If you claim you are a fork of pancake swap, then you are required to make your front-end and other pieces of software open source by following pancake GNU v-3 license. This will help in proving that you are not indeed a fork of MM finance   You mentioned a few times in the comments about ZZ Team. Highlight yourself and them in your proposal and give some background on the work that they are currently doing.   Deploy   I would encourage you to deploy first before requesting a grant to run incentives. Highlight your data clearly once you deploy to ensure that the amount you requested make sense to your TVL ",

The airdrop % is very small, and only to cro users, not poly (most recent ones) users. Considering this is a project funded by past investors of MMF, they want to give all past MMF users a fresh start. The total airdrop is 418 ZZF per wallet, and linearly vested 90 days, considering the IDO price 0.05, it is only worth $20.9, and will be vested over 90 days, means getting $0.232222 per day, may not even worth for the gas fee to claim anyway. BUT it can attract a lot of MMF users come to OP and increase the transactions too. Also, it is free advertisement at VERY low cost as well. ",
