Paragraph Summary MIP41c4-SP27 onboards Will Remor as RWF-001 Facilitator. Will Remor is a longstanding contributor to RWA work and research in MakerDAO.  Specification  Motivation As MakerDAO enters a new phase were rapid scalability of the RWA pipelines that have been built up over the past year becomes possible, I believe it is crucial that the RWA Core Unit is improved and decentralized into multiple Core Units, and I believe as the oldest RWA contributor in the MakerDAO ecosystem Will Remor is the right person to take the role of Acting Facilitator and oversee the decentralization process.  Core Unit ID RWF-001  Facilitator Name and Information  Name: William Remor Discord: @will.remor#4365 ETH Address: 0x44d2509074993b858c54B6d276ebD3816FC93A68   Facilitator Commitment I approached Will Remor and asked if he was willing to take on the role of Acting Facilitator to oversee the decentralization of the RWA Core Units. Will has decades of experience doing financial and credit transaction, and is the oldest contributor doing work related to RWA in the MakerDAO ecosystem, originally doing research under the Core Community Development umbrella. The objective will be to work with various stakeholders in the Maker RWA ecosystem to develop a solid and scalable framework for RWA onboarding and then execute within this framework while decentralizing the RWA Core Units by splitting the current RWF-001 Core Unit into multiple redundant RWA Core Units that can operate in parallel. The framework will based on things such as the Arranger Model, the results of Luca Prosperi\u2019s decentralized RWA research project and the input of MKR holders. ",

I know the people in this team to be highly qualified professionals with the right experiences to take Maker to the next level in its RWA journey. These are my key guiding thoughts: (1) How can those achievements be built upon while maintaining trust internally at the DAO and with the wider group of stakeholders? (2) How can all the foundational work be possibly improved, with an eye for fulfilling the original vision of distributed and nimble risk teams? (3) How can a facilitator be a part of that improvement process and vision implementation? My natural conclusion was that the facilitator role for RWA could only be performed if it was in an \u201cinterim\u201d capacity. This means the \u201cinterim facilitator\u201d is there in a consultative capacity to work alongside the stakeholders to oversee the transition of multiple RWF functions towards a decentralised state with multiple risk teams. SES has proved that such transitions can be done successfully with tech-focused teams. I believe that with the right frameworks, mindset and experienced professionals this can be done with RWA teams as well. ",

The above statement is suggesting to me that you don\u2019t see this as a long term position.   I would consider at least for the first RWF CU to want to have a strong lead that sees significant growth potential and to have a plan to stay for a while or until certain goals are achieved.  The idea we cycle through people in lead positions has risks and hazards\u2026 Do you see yourself only taking this position for a short time? One aspect no-one has even remotely talked about yet is the idea that Maker CU units (with significant expertise and experience) themselves could become independent businesses with multiple arms (or redundancies if you will) so that they could expand to more people, work across the industry using the people, talent and legal IP to assist others to bring on RWF driving additional revenue streams (this allows CUs to diversify revenues).   This has some hazards and like everything has pros and cons but a possible real path towards decentralization of CU services. ",
