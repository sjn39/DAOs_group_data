                    "content": "Basic Details Project name: Popcorn Author name and forum name (please provide a reliable point of contact for the project): Michael Kisselgof - RealMischa L2 recipient address: 0x186156eFC621721d58AFD8B9ec17890e4773A543 Which Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Season 3 - Voting Cycle #11 I confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders and Growth Experiments Sub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited to be reviewed by the Builders Sub-Committee: [Yes/No]: Project Details What are you going to build?: Popcorn is building VaultCraft, a common permissionless infrastructure that will allow Popcorn and all of Optimism\u2019s builders to spin up liquid, automated asset strategies on any EVM-compatible chain. This would be one of the first open protocols allowing for the modularization of vaults using a protocol-endorsed VaultFactory that ensures the safety of the strategy and its contracts. Vaults will be able to interact with a variety of protocols through the ERC4626-Wrapper and will also be stackable in design, meaning you will be able to build on top of other vaults. VaultCraft will also provide specialized module functionality for trading, leveraging, staking, and more. The protocol will dramatically reduce the required capital and time to market for any B2B enterprise, like Popcorn, looking to quickly expand its DeFi offering and allow anyone with little coding knowledge to mix and match both protocols and strategies to create sophisticated DeFi products within just a few clicks. Vaultcraft will serve as DeFi\u2019s AWS equivalent offering scalable solutions for new protocols and Popcorn will do for the yield space what Uniswap did for AMMs! Popcorn is a multi-chain ReFi yield-optimizing protocol offering exposure to liquid asset strategies that not only earn competitive yield on your crypto but simultaneously fund nonprofits and social impact organizations at no additional cost to the user. Popcorn is a non-custodial, decentralized, and audited protocol that is governed by PopcornDAO. Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?: Popcorn will be the first ReFi yield-optimization protocol that uses vaults to automatically fund public goods with no additional cost to the end user. We measure success with TVL and funds donated to public goods. Thus we\u2019re and confident VaultCraft will introduce a new paradigm for DeFi where anyone can custom-tailor multi-strategy vaults for any asset on any EVM-compatible chain, attracting more more TVL from DAO treasuries and crypto hedge funds, especially ones who are impact conscious. Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: With VaultCraft\u2019s permissionless tooling for vault creation, any dev or non-dev can contribute to DeFi\u2019s portfolio of yield-generating products within just a few clicks. We\u2019ve developed a simple UX for internal use that shows how you will be able to create a vault below: Steps in creating a vault with VaultCraft:  Choose your protocol Choose your asset Choose the adapter Pick a strategy Configure your fees  Popcorn and VaultCraft will benefit Optimism\u2019s ecosystem by attracting protocols, developers, and funds that are looking to expand on methods of yield generation, which will inevitably attract more users, increase Optimism\u2019s TVL, and provide more decentralized options to fund public goods. Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Yes, providing developers with VaultCraft to help develop safe, risk-adjusted vaults for assets on Optimism. This will improve the quality, scale, and security of products created by developers in the Optimism ecosystem. Is your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Developers will have an easy, positive experience using VaultCraft to develop on Optimism resulting in an increased commitment to further development on the platform. The ease of use in developing vaults that are compatible with all EVM chains will be beneficial to Optimism\u2019s long-term vision of developing a super chain. Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  dApp Website Twitter Discord/Discourse/Community Github Other: Interview on VaultCraft with Code4rena  Other: VaultCraft audit with 230+ white hats   Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):  TVL: $2M POP locked: 8.7M (dune) POP holders: 7,693 (dune) Twitter followers: 24.7K (Twitter) Discord members: 6,412 (Discord)  All data as of 02/27/2023 Who are your competitors?:  Yearn Beefy Yield Yak  What differentiates you from your competitors?: Popcorn bakes social impact into the heart of the protocol by automating fees to fund public goods. Non-profits and social impact organizations are determined by PopcornDAO. With the release of VaultCraft, not only will Popcorn be able to scale up its product offering and increase funding for public goods even more, but we will also provide DeF modularity in customizing automated asset strategies within just a few clicks. Popcorn can design products providing additional yield-generating opportunities for specific tokens or routing liquidity to specific yield opportunities on other protocols. Non-custodial, audited, and decentralized Vaults for Good will provide unique and novel methods of funding public goods as well. We also work closely with prestigious institutions for research and governance initiatives. Recently we onboarded the Oxford Blockchain Society, Vanderbilt Blockchain, and Blockchain at Michigan to the University Governance Program. Will your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please explain: Yes, Popcorn\u2019s vault strategies rely on routing liquidity through other protocols such as Yearn, Curve, and several more under development. Additionally, other projects can leverage VaultCraft to create their vault strategies that utilize more projects within the ecosystem. Team Who are your founders?: Anthony Martin Michael Kisselgof What makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this project (1-2 sentences on each)?: Michael contributed to and used the ERC-1155 Multi Token standard to fund and license bio R&D in 2017 in his first crypto project, IKU.

Launch Vaults & Vaults for Good in Q2 2023 Launch POP & OP Bounty program Onboard at least 3 launch partners in the Optimism ecosystem  Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: VaultCraft by Popcorn solves the following business problems when developing vaults:  Time to market Vault complexity = costly  Capital/HR and lack thereof Audit per vault = $$$   Technical debt Centralized & permissioned vault development Ad hoc vault development is not scalable  Popcorn will also be a new paradigm of DeFi products that allow you to passively generate yield on your crypto while funding public goods. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: By providing the following features in a common permissionless infrastructure:  EVM compatibility ERC4626-wrapper Fee customization Simplified UX for vault creation Protocol-endorsed factory for optimal safety and security Customization in a few clicks by choosing  Assets Protocols Modules - Trade | Stake | Leverage | Compound | Claim Rewards    Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Anyone will be able to use VaultCraft to create safe, risk-adjusted vaults for assets on any EVM-compatible chain. VaultCraft will dramatically scale up not only Popcorn\u2019s suite of yield-generating products, both for personal gain and for funding public goods, but Optimism\u2019s ecosystem of yield-generating products. How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: Popcorn launched on Optimism on November 3, 2022. Additionally, several governance proposals [PIP-6] [PIP-12] have migrated liquidity, focused research, and enabled governance functionality on the platform. We are committed to continued development within the ecosystem. Is your project Optimism Native?: No Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: ",

Firstly, the creation of VaultCraft will provide a common infrastructure for automated, liquid asset strategies on any EVM-compatible chain. This will make it possible for anyone to create sophisticated DeFi products with little coding knowledge, which will attract more users to the Optimism ecosystem. Secondly, Popcorn is the first yield-optimization protocol that uses vaults to fund public goods with no additional cost to the end-user. This social impact focus will appeal to users who want to support public goods and nonprofit organizations. Finally, VaultCraft will benefit the Optimism ecosystem by attracting protocols, developers, and funds looking to expand their methods of yield generation, which will increase TVL and provide more decentralized options to fund public goods.
