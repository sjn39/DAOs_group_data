                    "content": "If the Maker community is going to function properly as an distributed organisation we need to have some form of internal transparency and reporting with regards to the activity of Core Units. As long as the Foundation was in charge the information flow ended up there, but with the transition to the Community things will have to be done differently. Core Units that have both their mandate and their budget approved by the Community will also have to report status and have some form of transparency of activities. Otherwise the community has no way of checking if the Core Unit is doing anything useful, if they are successful in achieving goals or if they have problems they need help to overcome. Let me be specific The last couple of weeks has seen some proposed Core Units with some apparent overlap between mandates. A post was made pointing this out. Do note my slightly unfair tactic - in the chart I am comparing already existing groups like GRO and MARCOMMS with proposed Core Units. This touches off some defensive response providing information. The method is continued in replies to the post about the Marcomms Core Unit. @Sebventures then really uses the hammer. The people in GRO are now so provoked they will simply have to respond and @MarianoDP\u2019s excellent reply provides more insight into the as-is situation at GRO than I have ever heard in all my involvement with Maker starting in 2016. The community now knows several things that were not known until last week  GRO has identified the need for a fiat on/off ramp as extremely important but solving this has yet to begin. MARCOMMS will not consider the use of emotional arguments in their marketing, prefering education. Marketing of MKR is not on the mandate for any group, marketing of DAI is shared by at least four existing and proposed groups. This type of information is highly valueable for the discussion around MKR minting.  All of the above is excellent and relevant information, the only problem is that it was extracted through emotional provocation. This is highly suboptimal, creating lots of stress, but plainly necessary when the groups in question will not provide the community with a real-talk version of their activites. How about we evolve? We need some system for reporting and a certain level of transparency from Core Units to the Community. The Smart Contract team has a chart for Liq2.0 implementation displayed at meetings. @mrabino1 has a state of business thread updated every month at least. These are examples that can be built upon. Possibly signal requests could be used for this? Or the Core Unit could be totally open to questions from GOV001 which then could choose what to tell the community? I hope other community members pick up on this - we need something here. Feedback appreciated and as always please point out my mistakes. ",

The RWF Core Unit publish a monthly reporting since January. The idea was to provide the community real facts on what was done. It\u2019s far from perfect. The format might evolve and I\u2019m not sure it would be better to follow a template. OS also has one weekly reporting format. Another point of reporting and transparency is participating in the discussions. This seems an easy way for future Core Unit Facilitators to bring value to the table. Having those discussions is not easy. It would be easier not to care. But I really think MakerDAO can easily be a $100B market cap so \u2026 ",

I agree this is just ridiculous, especially because He didn\u2019t break any NDA communicating the very few informations he gave us. (thanks @MarianoDP!) My impression is simply that, while the Foundation was running things, there was no incentive at all for people to communicate their work to the community/governance. And this is understandable. Now, since these CU will have to be voted, things will probably change, as we are starting to see. My suggestion, is that we (governance) might offer good salaries but also short-duration \u2018contracts\u2019 (3/4 months) as opposed to 3-4 years, in such a way that, if we are not happy with the results/transparency, we are free to liquidate a given Core Unit.

With that being said, very few people care about decentralization philosophically, and those who do generally only care until it costs them money. People care about the tangible benefits of a decentralized system. This is why we\u2019ve historically targeted integrations and use cases where Dai is used as a savings mechanism (store of value) - higher savings rates are Dai\u2019s tangible benefit of being outside the existing financial system. To illustrate this further\u2026 There\u2019s four functions of money: (1) Medium of exchange (2) Store of value (3) Unit of account (4) Standard of deferred payment (i.e. used to denominate debts) I\u2019ll throw out (4) for the moment because that is implicit to Dai\u2019s generation process. Item (3) can be mapped to what I\u2019d call the \u201cblockchain vertical,\u201d i.e. when dapps use Dai as a native currency. Augur and Erasure are good examples of applications where Dai is the exclusive unit of account. We\u2019ve historically been very successful in this vertical, Dai is far more adopted across dapps than USDC or USDT. But items (1) and (2) are where the real volume is, and where you can penetrate markets that are outside of out existing ecosystem. Now when we look at (1), this is effectively payments and cross-border transfers. This requires deep liquidity, little to no slippage, and very easy on/off-ramps. USDC and USDT will beat us at this game every day because they have access to the banking system. Maker has to generate its liabilities on-chain, USDC and USDT can tokenize others liabilities without limit. But that leaves them in a precarious position, because when you tokenize someone else\u2019s liabilities you can only offer a fraction of the interest that they\u2019re willing to pay you (in this case it will map pretty closely to LIBOR). Dai, on the other hand, sets its savings rate based on the net stability fees earned from its pool of collateral and loans. It doesn\u2019t have to rely on the legacy banking system for its rates. This is a huge advantage especially at a relatively small scale. Dai can win the market, but we need to be intelligent about how we position ourselves. It\u2019s been my belief for the past several years that Dai as a store of value is the path forward. ",

                    "content": "Reporting and transparency are vital to the success of MakerDAO, and I doubt if anyone would disagree with that. What made me want to launch my unit is the belief in a better way to run an organization that is decentralized with information openly shared to the extent possible. I am confident that it is also a belief shared by the community, and it is the same belief that prompted someone like me from the foundation to launch their unit. The community wants clear answers on different topics, which is understandable. There is also a lack of trust and information sharing, which I believe can improve as we have more of these conversations going forward. As for my unit, we plan to provide a monthly report so the team can effectively share the information with the community like we have stated in our proposal. I want to point out that we all share a common goal of wanting MakerDAO to achieve its full potential, and we are all keen to contribute in the way we can best do so. Based on this common ground, let me share my thoughts as someone who has proposed a unit. I can\u2019t agree more with you about finding the process stressful. For example, I honestly find your suggestions on marketing campaigns engaging, and my response wasn\u2019t meant to be defensive, but somehow it was taken that way by others. Another example, I don\u2019t think I have said the use of emotional arguments is something we wouldn\u2019t consider. However, that is being listed in this post as a fact. When comments are taken out of context, or someone starts using the language of doubt and distrust, it would generally be difficult to continue a conversation productively. (I am not pointing fingers here. I only want to get my points across.) Let me share how I view the process so far, hoping that the community can see the information isn\u2019t meant to be hidden somewhere or not shared. Starting a unit and making proposals to the Maker governance community is unlike a centralized entity where decisions can easily be made and executed. There are still many moving parts that need to be considered. In the case of Strategic Marcomms, strategies and deliverables need to be discussed thoroughly. Bringing in each team member\u2019s expertise and engaging in the process is my way of building a solid team and how I see we can achieve our goals effectively. That conversation is taking place simultaneously as we assemble the team, working on business strategy and evaluating budget. Trying to do all these, including securing the best talents at one\u2019s best ability simultaneously without knowing the outcome, can also be challenging. After the set of proposals are submitted, including our strategy and plan, we are ready to hear the community\u2019s suggestions. Since we highly value the community\u2019s comments and feedback, we plan to take that and reassess the strategy we have put together after this Request-for-Comments period. Therefore, rather than having something set in stone like having affirmative answers on whether we will or will not run XYZ kind of campaign, we instead have the overall direction and regional strategy and approach set. That way, we can address some of the community\u2019s concerns and suggestions to achieve our mandate and serve the community. We can also be agile and adjust to the market environment when needed. On information sharing, how about having a list of questions and another list of suggestions so the units can address them? So far, the two have been mixed in discussions where intention and purpose sometimes get lost in long threads, creating misunderstanding. ",
