Pros:  Encourages more DAI minting with another stablecoin which will have a downward effect on the peg  Cons:  Creates more systemic risk by trusting a centralized authority with overall collateral/peg integrity Creates further incentive for USDC Vaults to never pay back their DAI If liquidations are turned on, depending on the LR/peg, keepers may have difficulty profitably liquidating these vaults  Should we reduce the USDC-A collateralization ratio?     Yes - 101% CR Yes - 102% CR Yes - 103% CR Yes - 104% CR Yes - 105% CR Yes - >105% CR No Abstain     0 voters     This poll will end 2020-09-08T04:00:00Z Next Steps: If passed, this signal request will turn into a pull request to be added to on-chain governance polling the following Monday.

It invites fewer whales to solve this problem for us, but this creates a problem when those few whales with all that debt need to deleverage quickly. Better to have 20 whales than 2 or 3. Since the 20 will average out the deleveraging in a less chaotic way. The actions of one whale are sudden. The actions of 20 or 30 are distributed and strengthen the solution to this problem. I hope I am thinking about this right. Interested in hearing others who agree with me. ",

Entering the trade will decrease the DAI price. But if nothing changes, exiting the trade will put you back in the starting position with no profit (if curve model is symmetric which I guess). You will be able to unwind only if something else change. If DAI = 1 USDC, I will buy some DAI to repay a vault. If I\u2019m representative, the trader can now only unwind with a loss. No rational trader will do that. You can argue that you have time. But if you have SF > 0%, at some point, the trader will no longer make a profit anyway. The vault will be forgotten and will result in bad debt when liquidation will be enabled. Those last month are not evidence to expect the peg to be restored in the short term, quite the opposite. Again, no rational trader will take that risk. Now setting the LR at 101% allows an immediate profit for the first traders (until 1 DAI = 1.001 USDC). But they won\u2019t repay the vault if nothing change. Same problem. At the end you end up with a lot of USDC on Maker balance sheet (or a loss if you liquidate them). ",

                    "content": "I have multiple issues here the closer this gets to 100%.    Really wanting to hear a cogent argument on how this would play out not on spin up.   But on wind down.   Say I leverage massively and then a 1-3% rate is dropped on me.   Very quickly I could be looking at liquidation.   Liquidations have not been turned on and we don\u2019t even have a tested working liquidation system on this.   My problem here is that Maker could end up with a ton of USDC on the books and there is no hint that liquidity created by this facility is going to do anything to the PEG generally without a lot of DAI liquidity tossed at it.   I like idea that fees \u2018could\u2019 be put on this and that \u2018liquidations\u2019 \u2018could\u2019 be enabled.  But when I think of a LR of 1.01 my gut says do this right now and the facility will be maxed and probably for the most part abandoned.  If we had liquidations on I might go for a LR of 105 but not 101. I remember rune saying this isn\u2019t a problem since the backing value to DAI is actually > 1. I honestly think LRs in the 101 range are a mistake without having liquidations enabled as this means everyone will peg to max and if any fees are turned on and these people can sell DAI for > 1.01 they literally walk and let Maker clean up the mess afterwards by auctioning off USDC for DAI and either getting no takers or ending up taking a loss on this. I also want to iterate.  I have been one to short the PEG particularly in the 1.025 and up ranges because I have been able to close lower using various strategies but this is becoming more and more difficult and I still have some DAI to pay back on a small USDC vault opened.   Leveraging I made basically 5-7% maybe 3-4% after tx fees to roll into leverage so honestly even with the current 110LR I made money this concept that somehow going to LR of 101 is desperately needed and \u2018will\u2019 fix the PEG magically without any reprocussions to Maker system.    Good luck with that. I voted no change because of the above.   I might consider going to 105 LR but that is about it.  I made some good money shorting the PEG and covering but a 105 LR isn\u2019t going to encourage me to lever up from the 5x I have done to 10x.   The lack of liquidations means I can go right to the limit anyway but I don\u2019t feel comfortable doing that kind of leverage.    Literally this facility can already act if the price gets to 1.025 or above.   I am choosing not to anymore for a whole slew of reasons.  Unpredicatbility of rate changes especially hard if I have high leverage. Are liquidations going to be turned on EVER?    Inquiring minds want to know.   What will Liquidation fees be - don\u2019t even think you are going to get 13% at a LR of 110% even if people levered up (you get 10% max if you\u2019re lucky this gets even worse as the LR goes down). What is the evidence lowering this is going to help anyone take on the DAI short and actually lower the PEG because frankly I don\u2019t see a high DC with governance being extremely conservative regarding DC liqudiity to actually do this.  (i.e. governance power here is limited because of the conservative approach to this PEG issue generally) What are the real risks here.   I have not heard one word from risk on what implications are on a 105LR much less a 101LR?  So count my \u2018NO\u2019 vote here as a yes to LR of 105 but as someone who actually has shorted the PEG actively and done pretty well I am telling you changing the LR from 110 to 105 won\u2019t do crap to change my trading here. Change this to 105 and say you will never enable liquidations AND a SF on this vault and I will lever up everytime as long as fees don\u2019t kill me on the size of my working capital for a trade.   This is the truth from one real DAI-USDC shorter and trader. ",

I think I picked your post to reply to because I agreed the most with your post and your quote of @SebVentures  on this topic in this sense that you replied to @SebVentures on \"would be happy to join the 105% or lower pack if someone (domain teams?) provides an analysis that liquidation (or in my case vault abandonment) is not a problem. I also have added that with 13% liquidation fee any vault with LRs below 113% make no sense really. At LR of 101% literally the only piece with a chance for a fee is the 1% on the 100% and that is provided a liquidation gets full value which I am pretty sure it won\u2019t.     Which is my biggest beef here. I don\u2019t have a good handle on what Liq 2.0 much less 1.1 will do on the DAI prices fetched for USDC in these vaults given tx fees, and spreads on liquidation.   1% doesn\u2019t leave any room to make sure the system captures full DAI return much less any profit as a penalty for a vault liquidating.    My concern here is the behavorial mechanics get broken as we get too close to 100% and that the system will generate deficits liquidating these abandoned vaults (particularly if one tries to apply fees).

Also I have maintained when decentralized incentives won\u2019t work to create more liquidity the protocol itself has to stand up and provide liquidity as a liquidity provider of last resort.   Personally I would like to see a alogrithmic PSM where the facility usage determines the bid/ask prices offered and just use keepers to trigger auctions in the PSM bid/ask spread. I have also advocated for creating a secondary surplus for multiple reasons.   Using purchased assets to sell for DAI to mop up liquidity when times are good, and buying them when times are bad to inject DAI a valid use for liquidity but this secondary surplus probably wouldn\u2019t have enough financial power as doing something like a dynamic PSM with a very heavy DC weight (say .5-1B). I was interested in the MIP20 Vox idea mostly because it would finally break the 1:1 collateral backing to DAI which I thought was another straight up way to manage the PEG.  Unfortunately it looks like the community considers 1:1 DAI backing MORE important than the PEG otherwise we would have tried something like that by now. Let me add something here.   Getting RWA on to the protocol might also do more for the PEG than anything else other than a .5-1B DC on a dynamic PSM facility or moving off the 1:1 DAI backing.   Literally the PEG mechanics are correct the problem is we have a very strong exogenous driver skewing demandand still not enough DAI in markets to satisfy this.   Also I don\u2019t know if this was discussed but after the move in rates up - market PEG responded by going up from 1.015ish to 1.03 and looking to go higher (I am skeptical we hit 1.04 but we will see).   2.5% now to pay for a 2% yrly rate to close. really?..   It will be interesting to see if people think extending the 2% SF to ETH flies and what this does to the PEG. BTW:  After doing some reading on the crypto trilemma that one thing must give (scaling, decentralization, correctness) I am beginning to think there is a similar PEG trilemma (PEG, decentralization, 1:1 backing) where decentralization means the protocol NOT taking on the liquidity risk via direct intervention via a number of mechanisms proposed.  The prime reason other PEGs work is because there is a redemption faucet somewhere for stablecoins.   There is no such faucet available with DAI which I think is why @rune wanted desperately a PSM with 1:1 exchange rate.   It makes sense if you think of wanting a DAI 1:1 USD redemption faucet somewhere to maintain the PEG. ",

I just was checking outstanding and it looks like the USDC vault pegged at maximum again which is probably why we are at 1.03 - no-one can short the PEG using USDC anymore.  Also the outstanding looks like it increased slightly so can\u2019t say this move was DAI closing vaults.  Probably really due to more demand cropping up and USDC not being able to short this to satisfy the price rise. Maker really needs a better mechanism for DC management so we don\u2019t have to micromange these changes - just set high and low limits and how much the DC\u2019s can change during some fixed period (like 24hrs) ",

The debt ceilings get hit, there are no safe ways to mint DAI and the peg goes off.   I couldn\u2019t agree more.   I also want to add that I believe that a whole lot of the micromanaging stuff needs to be moved more towards the EPCs.   Literally I\u2019d like to see an EPC dealing with all of the SF, LR, LF and just putting forward what they believe should be next changes.  This would have the added benefit of saddling them with looking to improve the system with wholesale changes because it would get work off their tables.   The idea that governance needs and should micromanage all of this - really ludricous.   Create teams of people led by a central EPC with at least one assistant and one in training who makes the general recommendations for discussion, then after community feed back with a positive poll drop it out for governance to yeah/nay. I also believe we need a way to asynchronize some of the control aspects.  I know @LongForWisdom for a long time has cringed as we \u2018bundle\u2019 more and more things together in executive votes mostly because a no vote doesn\u2019t give a clear signal as to \u2018what of the bundle\u2019 was so bad.  Worse we pass something because part A, B and C of executive were so needed - while people hated D, E and F because what we desperately need A, B and C and - we can fix D,E, F later.   This end result really is bad policy generally.   Swallow some poison just to get your medicine kind of approach to doing something. I really want to see governance do one thing that gets a chunk of this micromanagement stuff off governance plates and puts it into hands of an EPC or a EPC group to make recommendations or so reduces governance cadence as to open up more governance bandwidth for other things. I think this whole DC management issue is ripe for a new and different approach.     Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module: Pre-MIP Discussion Proposal Ideas       Hi all,  The purpose of this forum post is to revisit the discussion on how a Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module could work. This work builds upon the thoughts generated in MIP17 and the subsequent community discussions such as the Working Group Call and the 30th July G&R Call, which describes MIP17 as laying the groundwork for a future Instant Access Module (IAM) to help automate such functions.  This post, therefore, illustrates exploratory work done by the Smart Contracts Team for how an IAM \u2026     So we need to focus on the things we know we can get off our plate.  Once this happens governance bandwidth increases so we can then focus on the harder things. ",

After that we submitted a ranked choice poll for options from 105%->101% due to the signal request poll being pretty close/contested. This on-chain poll can be found here.
