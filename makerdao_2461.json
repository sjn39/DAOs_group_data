                    "content": "Introduction The Maker community has been intensively discussing how to address the issues surrounding the DAI peg over the last three months. The recent pressure caused by COMP farmers using Dai as their asset of choice has accelerated the need to address this issue more formally. As of today, the community is moving forward with the response of increasing the USDC debt ceiling, which is important because it means that Maker Governance is showing a willingness to defend the peg, ultimately helping keep confidence in the Maker system. However, there are some issues with stablecoins as collateral that we must keep in mind. One of the main primary issues being that the liquidations for stablecoins are not currently turned on due to the current auction system not being well suited to handle liquidations of stablecoins. Another important issue is that adding stablecoins as collateral cannot actually fix the Dai peg, but only make it \u201cless broken.\u201d This means that the people who use Dai in their daily life, for companies that use Dai for business, or DeFi projects that integrate Dai, are still not getting the peg they expect or need. Recently, the community has proposed alternative solutions that actually go a step further and have the potential to fix the peg immediately. One of the alternative solutions is displayed below:  A thread detailing options for responses to the COMP farming risks, by @MakerMan and @Bit. They proposed that the DAO should create an Automated Market Maker that would autonomously trade Dai against USDC at the peg, directly injecting liquidity and stability into the Dai market.  Note that this concept has been proposed in a few different variations several times by community members in the past, for example:  By community member @LongForWisdom:  The Stablematic On-chain Market Maker   By community member @mmoossttaaffaa:  Idea to significantly lower centralized stablecoins risks as collaterals while scaling Dai USDC Vaults vs. Arbitrage Reservoirs    Initial Research and Findings After some initial research on how to implement the community proposed concept to fix the peg, the Foundation concluded that it could be achieved by reusing a variation of the code that was used to facilitate the Sai to Dai migration bridge during the Multi Collateral Dai upgrade. This solution will be called a Peg Stabilization Module (PSM). This is great because it means that the solution has already been tested extensively, having been live and battle-tested for six months. Thus, a Peg Stabilization Module can potentially be implemented immediately, quickly giving Maker Governance an option to bring relief to the Dai peg and shift risk away from the stablecoin collateral types that don\u2019t currently support liquidations. How do Peg Stabilization Modules work? A Peg Stabilization Module is very similar to using a stablecoin like USDC as collateral for Dai, except it enforces a price of 1 USDC per Dai directly in the market. This ultimately makes Dai significantly more liquid and stable. Using USDC as an example, Maker Governance would approve a special USDC collateral type with a Peg Stabilization Module adapter. The Peg Stabilization Module adapter would not allow users to join USDC as collateral into the Maker Protocol (the way standard adapters work), but instead would allow two things:  Allow anyone to trade USDC for Dai, given the special collateral type has the available debt ceiling. Allow anyone to trade Dai for USDC, given the Peg Stabilization Module has the available USDC.  In scenario #1, when a user trades USDC for Dai with the Peg Stabilization Module, it automatically uses the provided USDC to instantly generate the corresponding amount of Dai through the special collateral type adapter. In scenario #2, when a user trades Dai for USDC with the Peg Stabilization Module, it automatically uses the Dai to pay down its debt and free up the corresponding amount of USDC. Governance Control of Peg Stabilization Modules Governance can control Peg Stabilization Modules in the same way that it controls other collateral types in the Maker Protocol. Primarily, the Debt Ceiling risk parameter can be used to control how much exposure the system can have to a particular stablecoin. Diversification can be used to further manage the risk of the system and make sure that all of the exposure isn\u2019t concentrated in a single stablecoin, but is instead spread out across several stablecoins (based on their perceived risk). Governance will also be able to set a spread on the Peg Stabilization Module, allowing it to charge a small fee on every trade that is sent to the buffer - this way it becomes an income-generating feature and helps to pay MKR holders for the risk they are taking on the stablecoin collateral. This solution is both very useful for the short term situation that the community finds itself in, with the system out of balance for a prolonged duration, and the mounting pressure from the COMP distribution to Dai holders. Considerations for Peg Stabilization Modules: Short and Long term Benefits Creating more Dai utility through a stable peg The number one objective of the Maker protocol and Maker governance is to maintain the stability of Dai, so that the people, businesses and DeFi protocols that rely on it can trust that their money is protected from volatility. Delivering against this promise will drive continued growth of the project. The Peg Stabilization Module can restore the peg and utility of Dai to users around the world, which makes it a very important change to consider. Strengthening the collateral portfolio by replacing collateral types that cannot be liquidated The Maker protocol currently has a lot of Dai generated from the USDC-A collateral type, which has liquidations disabled. This is an undesirable situation, because the Maker Protocol wasn\u2019t designed to support having collateral types with liquidations turned off, and it could potentially result in Vaults with more debt than collateral value that would be abandoned by their owners, yet still remain in the collateral portfolio. But having liquidations disabled was necessary due to the fact that the current auction system is not well suited for liquidating low-risk assets, so it was done as a short term solution that would be replaced in the future. The Peg Stabilization Module is such a solution that would be able to replace this collateral type. It would allow Maker Governance to altogether remove stablecoin based collateral types from the system in the short run, solving the issue of disabled liquidations entirely, and removing any risk that the system will end up having abandoned, unliquidated Vaults with more debt than collateral value. Encouraging natural Dai generation from other collateral types through stability and liquidity A significant advantage of the Peg Stabilization Module is that it helps with stability and liquidity when the price goes above the peg. It also helps to provide liquidity and stability for when there is Dai supply to sell. This means that it helps encourage vault creation and Dai generation from other assets, such as ETH, because it gives vault users a lot of reliable liquidity to sell their Dai to if they are looking to pull fiat currency out from their vault. Generally, a reliable peg makes Vault holders more willing to generate Dai. In contrast, an uncertain peg makes it riskier to generate Dai, since it is less clear if it will be possible to later unwind the position again without having to buy back Dai at a price different from the peg. Providing a solution to this issue with the Peg Stabilization Module is a significant advantage in the short run to try to get the Protocol back into a natural balance. Still, it will also continue to be a substantial advantage in the long term. It generally improves the user experience and value proposition the system offers to its users, both Dai users and Vault users. Natural unwinding During times when the Maker Protocol is out of balance, the Peg Stabilization Module will keep the Dai peg stabilized by building up potentially large amounts of stablecoins as collateral. Since the Peg Stabilization Module encourages natural Dai generation, the built-up stablecoins within the Peg Stabilization Module will be used by new Vault users to exit to fiat if there is a significant buildup (this will only be temporary). This means that the Peg Stabilization Module naturally unwinds itself as the system goes back into a balanced state. Therefore, the Peg Stabilization Module will not contribute to the long-term buildup of stablecoins as collateral in the system. Instead, it will work against it by helping to bring the system back into balance quickly. This ultimately minimizes the amount of time the Maker Protocol needs to have substantial exposure to stablecoins. Becoming the trading hub for stablecoin swaps Another long term advantage that the Peg Stabilization Module offers is the ability to become a hub for trading different stablecoins against each other. If Maker Governance adds multiple stablecoins to Peg Stabilization Modules and enables low-fee 1:1 trading for each of them (against Dai), it would allow the trading of different stablecoins against each other as a side-effect. As a result, this would ultimately help with overall liquidity in the DeFi ecosystem. At the same time, Maker would be compensated by charging the Peg Stabilization Module spread twice for providing the service. Creating a reliable on-chain signal for automatic Dai Savings Rate (DSR) and Base Rate adjustments A planned feature of the Maker Protocol is a system for automatically adjusting the DSR and Base rate in response to changes in the market dynamics of Dai, to help better keep the long term stability of Dai. This would be similar to an earlier described feature of the system known as the TRFM (Target Rate Feedback Mechanism). Because changes in the market dynamics will instantly be reflected in the balance of stablecoins against Dai in the Peg Stabilization Module, this will provide a reliable, on-chain signal that such a system could The Peg Stabilization Module is a very powerful concept, so it isn\u2019t unlikely that there would be even more long term advantages that will be discovered by the community, once the immediate issue of managing the peg has been dealt with. Next steps Overall, this forum post aims to make the community aware that this proposal exists and that it is indeed technically feasible to implement on very short notice since a variation of the code used to facilitate the Sai to Dai migration bridge during the Multi Collateral Dai upgrade can be used. In terms of the immediate future, the plan is to continue research and development over the course of the weekend to test further the feasibility of implementing a Peg Stabilization Module quickly - So Maker Governance will have the option to use the Peg Stabilization Module to bring immediate relief to the peg as soon as possible. Initially, due to the time-sensitivity of maintaining the peg, the Peg Stabilization Module would be proposed as a non-Maker Improvement Proposal (MIP) executive vote that could be done on short notice. However, if the proposal is accepted by the community, the Maker Foundation will work with the community to create an official MIP that formalizes the various governance aspects surrounding Peg Stabilization Modules, and allows the community to iterate and build on top of the concept.

I also had an idea that IF this module is updated to have multiple ones with different DCs and up/down spreads. Example:  One facility limited to 10M DAI working outside of the .995 to 1.005 range.   Another with 25M working outside of the .99 to 1.01 range and the last with say up to 50M working outside of the .98 and 1.02 ranges. I was told unfortunately the modules as they exist now do not have this bi-directional pricing.   When I think about this I don\u2019t know why we can\u2019t just apply a fixed fee on the trade of some fraction of a percent to elicit this spread.   Will leave this up for discussion as these were the only two ideas I had for modifications to this proposal that would make it a lighter hammer but still achieve the same results vs. doing 1:1 straight up. Direct injection of DAI to markets to manage the PEG via a Maker facility that anyone can use to now actually arb the PEG prices directly. ",

                    "content": "I\u2019m trying to think about the differences between this Peg Stabilization Module (PSM) and current USDC vaults:  PSM offers infinite leverage up to some debt ceiling. You need 1 USDC to generate 1 DAI, but you can sell that DAI for USDC on the market and generate more DAI, etc until the trade is unprofitable vs vaults where you can only generate some finite amount of DAI per USDC PSM is unaffected by the risk premium and base rate. There is no stability fee. Instead, risk is charged as a small exchange fee.  We already have good tools to address the DAI/USDC < 1 situation: increase base rate and DAI savings rate until the peg is restored. Therefore, let\u2019s focus on the problem of DAI/USDC > 1,  USDC vaults can generate DAI and dump it on the market for >1 hoping to profit when DAI/USDC dips to <1. However, good market timing is required because the stability fee erodes the profit and can turn the trade into a loss. For PEM, holders of USDC can generate DAI 1:1 for a small fee. This DAI can be sold on the market for >1 DAI/USDC with the intent to reverse the trade when DAI/USDC <1. No special market timing is required because the exchange fee is fixed. The USDC obtained from selling DAI can be recycled again to sell more DAI with infinite leverage up to some debt ceiling.  The original post seemed to suggest that PEM can provide everything that vaults provide and more; stablecoin vaults can be retired once PEM is introduced. I guess we still want to keep the USDC-B vault type around to provide emergency liquidity for auctions. ",

But having liquidations disabled was necessary due to the fact that the current auction system is not well suited for liquidating low-risk assets, so it was done as a short term solution that would be replaced in the future.   Just to be clear. If we introduce this change we would be looking replace the current USDC-A, USDC-B, TUSD, etc vault types? I.E get everyone to pay back the DAI they owe there and set the debt ceiling to 0. If so, What is the current proposal for doing that?

                    "content": "Remember something about these stablecoins - there is an issuer who will give $1 USD for example for the 1 USDC - Coinbase. So while these market prices can move around (USDT frequently sits a little off $1) usually the issuer itself can either sop up liquidity if the stablecoin they issue drops below $1, they can also provide liquidity if the price is > $1. In both cases they make the difference as profit and simply use their own USD on account against their stablecoin to keep backing intact while still making profit off PEG deviations in various markets. I am not entirely sure this is done - but it can be done provided the issuer uses their own USD to back the minting of their own stablecoin to manage external market prices and liquidity issues in relation to market price deviations away from their PEG. The point of not clamping this strictly to 1:1 and having multiple facilities with different DC\u2019s and active up/down prices means when one facility is drained and the PEG rises or falls we get a pretty accurate measure of the strains on the market in terms of liquidity vs. pricing with regards to rate adjustments required to bring the PEG back in line. In my post I picked fixed DAI values for the different DC\u2019s but really these should be a % of the total DAI outstanding. PSM line 1 drawn say at .995 and 1.005 funded with 5% of the outstanding DAI at the time, .99 to 1.01 with 10% and .98 to 1.02 with 25% etc. Last and most important point: This way these PSM act as kind of automatic PEG circuit breakers with limited liquidity and when drained and the next PSM active we get rough measures from the market about what to do with fees to drive the PEG back into line and drain the PSMs back to normal. I think the hazard here is if for some reason USDC drops in value relative to USD too much. Should we have a circuit breaker on the PSM to deactivate it in case something goes whacky in the markets here. We are NOT going to want to wait the GSM to deactivate a PSM that in effect is losing value for some reason. Just a small thought here I am still wondering if it is a real concern or not. ",

Not clamping the facility to 1:1 bidirectional still means people can use vaults. Whether to turn liquidations on on these.  I think with the vaults and the PSM we have to ask a basic question what do we do if the USDC:USD oracle value is < 1 significantly and this is why the DAI:USDC PEG is off while the DAI:USD PEG right on.?   What is the real condition for operation of the PSM  DAI:USDC price or DAI:USD price.   My understanding is that we want these all to operate on the DAI:USD price not the DAI:USDC price. Notice in the compound protocol DAI basically has a DAI:USD oracle price used that can go up or down depending on the current PEG state to determine if a vault is undercollateralized and hence should be liquidated. Does this whole thing require a kind of stablecoin:USD oracle against the DAI:USD oracle to use to determine price metric and hence the up/down stablecoin prices the PSM will offer or is this redundant?

So we may want an auction mechanism for the PSM if the DAI:USDC rate is low and no-one is clearing the PSM.   I don\u2019t think this would happen because if people can cycle the trade through 10K DAI would come back and do the reverse levering to unwind that 100M because they would net some profit draining the PSM at .995 if the price is .991. The question is what if the DAI USDC price is between .995 and 1.005 and the PSM 1 module is maxed at the DC and rates are going up.   Is it a problem for the protocol that the USDC in the PSM is not paying the SF?    If the SF gets high enough it might be worthwhile for market players to use the PSM (even at a slight loss) to offset the building losses from the SF fees in their vaults. Ah so the point here is what if this DAI is deposited in the DSR and we are paying more fees in the DSR than SF fees generated.   That is a good point and a reason to adjust how the DSR acts not as a rate but as a fixed rate but as a % of the fees generated.   So the protocol never loses money on the DSR against SF unless governance specifically directs it to.    But I think this is a good point. PSM management up/down prices and hence spread and DC of the facilities will need to be managed against the other monetary levers and may end up bringing too much complexity to governance here as we are talking about using a spread (up/down price difference as a fee) with a DC against vaults that have a running SF against a facility with no SF and a fixed fee. Good catch on the whole DSR issue against this here and SF fees.   I think this was why I wanted multiple PSMs with different up/down prices and DC\u2019s with total DC not to exceed 50% of the outstanding SF payind DAI as I think the 40-50% DAI liquidity should be enough to manage the PEG but would only add 25-33% drain on SF against potential DSR cost.   We would have to have DSR spread 0 and over 70% of the DAI in the DSR for this to happen but it is a cosideration to take into account.  Realize if we get into this situation governance can just increase the DSR spread from the SF. ",

In short, a PSM is very similar to using a stablecoin like USDC as collateral for Dai, except it enforces a price of 1 USDC per Dai directly in the market. This concept ultimately makes Dai significantly more liquid and stable.  The results of this\u2026     ",

                    "content": "Due to the abbreviated discussion period, I\u2019ll briefly add some summaries of thoughts here. An attempt will be made to come up with a more prolonged and reasoned and comprehensive response soon. I will say that the speed with which is moving should be concerning to everyone. This proposal represents a fundamental change from what Dai is, i.e. a decentralized stablecoin with an overcollateralized basket of currencies backing it, to a hybrid token that is partially overcollateralized and partially collateralized at a 100% ratio to a competing stablecoin. As a Dai holder, I am more attracted to the former and less to the latter. Many in the community will feel the same if Dai no longer maintains the same guarantee of overcollaterization and loses some of it\u2019s luster as a premium collateral. This may be a non-issue in the short term if Dai is clearly in demand, but I am concerned about the mid-to-long term view of Dai as a collateral. This will spark competition from those seeking a more decentralized alternative, and some may find themselves wondering what benefit there is to holding Dai as a proxy for USDC, when they can just hold USDC itself. Due to it\u2019s current standing as an investment-grade collateral type, Dai has lately maintained a premium against USDC, I would argue that this premium exists because of Dai\u2019s nature as a permissionless, overcollateralized, and decentralized stablecoin, a superior product to USDC in many ways, and assume that many who use Coinbase as their fiat onramp immediately convert their USDC to Dai when it\u2019s available on mainnet. If my suspicions are correct, then Dai could theoretically have to absorb hundreds of millions of additional USDC in this market in order to reach saturation and partity against USDC. A $20mm PSM would immediately get tapped out and we would be in the same situation that we are in now, with the exception that Dai would now be less collateralized. The PSM alters the incentive mechanism of vaultholders by subtracting market incentives that they could have actualized by generating and selling Dai at the premium. It stunts the organic growth of Dai by socializing the USDC risk into the protocol for a one-time fee. By adopting this approach, we disincentivize essential market makers from participating in the system. Dai is currently in a period of extreme demand. Our debt ceilings are full, the solution for now seems to be to raise the ETH debt ceiling to a level that can consume this demand. ETH is still the premier collateral type for the MCD system, and it\u2019s clear that there is market demand for additional ETH vault capacity. Due to the seemingly overwhelming desire to provide additional Dai liquidity in an emergency situation, it is difficult to come out entirely opposed to this solution, however, it is important to understand and express how this seemingly simple modification will alter the public perception of what Dai is and what draws people to it. Use of Maker by vault holders is not a foregone conclusion and it\u2019s innate incentive mechanisms are the incentive to particpate and generate more Dai to sell on the market. Every Dai that is sold by the PSM contract is effectively some amount of profit lost to a market maker, and also a reduction in the perceived security of Dai itself as an overcollateralized stablecoin. In current conditions, the current market could easily eat tens to hundreds of millions of USDC and still not return Dai back to the peg, while reducing the percentage of overall collateral subject to a custodial stablecoin. Any artificial cap on this mechanism in today\u2019s market will quickly be reached and we will be in the same position that we are in currently, with the exception that we will have a less secure Dai, a less desirable Dai from a collateralization perspective, and a protocol that is subject to additional regulatory pressure. If this mechanism is to be considered, I would urge that the fee bands be wide enough to avoid market interference except in the most extreme of circumstances of demand. It is not clear to me that we\u2019ve reached that point, the current debt ceilings are maxed and the market has an appetite for further leveraging. Give the existing mechanisms room to breathe. During an acute spike, use the PSM as an emergency valve. The rest of the time, the market must be permitted to work as designed so that the incentive mechanisms have the effect of naturally increasing and decreasing supply. Anyways, I\u2019m sorry if this seems disjointed. I haven\u2019t had time to fully collect my thoughts on this. In the same vein, we have not had a chance to perform any sort of economic or public perception survey on how this change will affect prices or sentiment. ",

Overcollateralization of Dai is a red herring when it comes to USDC - the real issues are the USDC debt ceiling (because this is what creates the risk for MKR holders), the income that is generated for MKR holders from USDC collateral, and whether Dai minted from USDC helps restore the peg.   The problem with the current situation is that people minting DAI from USDC are not helping the peg- they are leveraging it on Compound to farm COMP.  This is terrible for the system since we take on the risk and the bad publicity of using USDC, we get a small SF income of 4%, and there is no selling of Dai to help restore the peg. The beauty of the PSM is that all USDC collateral is used to directly restore the peg (because the protocol is buying USDC and selling DAI) vs. the current system where no DAI need be sold on the market.   The trading fees can be implemented to restore any lost revenue from the current SF on USDC. You might wonder why people don\u2019t take advantage of the current high Dai price to mint Dai from USDC collateral and sell Dai on the market hoping to buy it back once the peg is restored.  The reason is that it just too risky to make the arb.  There is no guarantee the peg will be restored in a short time frame and MKR holders keep raising the SF on USDC collateral (0\u2013> 4%), which is basically an attack on people who are trying to use USDC collateral to help restore the peg. tl:dr:  currently we could raise the USDC debt ceiling to 100m USDC and all new Dai would go to farming comp and not restoring the peg.  No dai need be sold on the market.  Under the PSM, we could take on 100m in USDC collateral, and every Dai minted would be a market sell to restore the peg, and MKR holders would make the same income. ",

Currently, when you mint dai from USDC, you retain your ownership of the USDC and if you send the Dai to Compound, there is no sale of Dai that occurs.  Under the PSM, every exchange involves someone purchasing Dai at a price below the market (assuming Dai is above the peg) - which has the direct effect of lowering the Dai price.  This is a huge difference than the current system.  Agree with you that at 40m debt ceiling, we may not restore the peg, but at least every USDC in the 40m has resulted in a sale below the market price putting pressure on the Dai price as you have a seller offering Dai for less than others.   At current exchange volumes, if you sold 100m Dai at 1 USDC, you would absolutely make the price of Dai fall. Basically the PSM is identical to a large market sell order of Dai at a price of 1 USDC.  As long as the sell order is large enough, the peg will be restored.  In current system, you could mint a billion Dai and if it all got sent to Compound and leveraged there, the Dai price would not change. ",

I too had this idea back in April, but decided that there are very heavy implications for what DAI is, it\u2019s market based peg balancing mechanism, the risks and rewards of those mechanisms, DAI growth, and a while host of other implementation details.   My PSM was more of a fly-wheel that would unlock liquidity over time so as not to completely destroy the existing market mechanisms that balance the peg:     [Action Required] State of the Peg Governance       Earlier this week I was thinking about a medium term solution while dealing with some insomnia.  Since insomnia ideas are the opposite of shower thoughts, it might be terrible with some obvious failing.  What\u2019s more, this idea probably wouldn\u2019t work all that well unless places like DEX.AG integrated it.  I\u2019m still wrestling with it, and the full version is probably its own post if not its own MIP, but here\u2019s the short version.  We create a kind-of flywheel module to the Maker Protocol that is s\u2026     As you can see I eventually walked away from this idea.  I had one other iteration in my head that solved some of these problems, but it started to rival the complexity of the Maker Protocol itself, and without the careful thought and economic analysis, I started to find peace with, and wisdom in, the existing mechanism design. So, perhaps we want an emergency facility for peg management that activates at some spread, or perhaps we want to unlock more DAI with time (fly-wheel), and perhaps we want both mechanisms or none at all.  I can assure you that what we\u2019re discussing is technically possible, and is even possible to do with little technical risk; however we need much more time to think about all the macro implications of this module, in addition to its possible implementation details. As @brianmcmichael indicated earlier, we are hoping to work up and release a forums post with more details that should be considered before we fast-track the PSM through the MIPs process.  Much of those considerations strike at the heart of what DAI is, how it\u2019s used, how it grows, and the interplay of these, sometimes at odds, goals.      ",

However, as you said, most of us (myself included) abandoned these ideas because when we looked at them for awhile, we started to realize that the raptor we were chasing in this case was just luring us to a place his other raptor buddies could maul us to shreds.  The system needs negative rates, or some other balancing factor to solve this issue.  Soaking up potentially billions of dollars in USDC is more like cornering ourselves\u2026 ",

Currently we have ~22m DAI backed by USDC but almost none of it is helping the peg since its just sent to Compound to farm COMP.  If we implement the PSM and add a 20m limit sell order at 1 dai for 1 usdc, it may be enough to meaningfully improve the peg.  The demand for Dai is not infinite.  I think 50m sell pressure could restore the peg given when we are today, and that amount of risk is acceptable right now to address the peg problem. ",

A question of whether to liquidate entirely the side of the facility vs. saving some USDC for the low side of the spread will need to be asked.   How much USDC do we want to \u2018retain\u2019 in the facility as the low side of the spread liquidity stabilizer.    So consider that we will want to have some amount of USDC in the a DAI/USDC PSM facility so we can make both sides ot the trade on this spread.   Use the liquidation system to manage the assets in each facility via reverse auctions to sell towards 1 from the outsides of the spread if we exceed the nominal collateral level in the facility.   Keeping some stablecoin in system as the nominal collateral level to provide liquidity in the spread will be important.  Using keeper system to auction towards 1 to relive excess pressure until nominal stablecoin level is reached will be another tool to drive the price towards 1 using the liquidity provided by takers hitting the outside of the spread.

I just want to say I\u2019m very excited again about the PSM. It seems like it is a better approach than the current stablecoin vaults because anyone, not just the vault owner, can unwind the stablecoin balances. Not only does it create an upper limit on the DAI price (with enough debt ceiling) but it could provide substantial DAI to stablecoin liquidity. Plus MakerDAO generates fees on both ends! ",
