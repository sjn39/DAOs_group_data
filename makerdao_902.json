If I have my MKR tokens locked into AAVE (I\u2019ve borrowed against my MKR tokens to purchase more MKR) \u2014 am I able to still vote with my MKR? Or, because it\u2019s locked into AAVE, am I unable to vote with those tokens? ",

There is no way to double spend it, so you would not be able to vote twice with it. It would make most sense if you can only supply it as collateral, and not be borrowed. However in case you can borrow it, you would just be shuffling votes around, the total amount would still be the same. I think you would need some kind of intermediary contract to handle the deposit balances in the DS-Chief. ",
