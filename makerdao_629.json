I want to thank @Andy_McCall @Allan_Pedersen for their comments.  Summary  This ALM framework proposes to optimize the MakerDAO balance sheet for MKR token holders profitability while being subject to a set risk constraints MKR profitability is a slightly modified return on equity formula Two groups of constraints are: solvency and liquidity Solvency risks aim to ensure the backing of DAI  Asset risk is the fluctuation of asset prices Market risk is linked to liquidation issues of crypto-loans Interest-rate risk is related to fixed-term lending Counterparty risk is the failure of a counterparty on its expectations Credit risk is the inability to repay a loan from a borrower   Liquidity risks aim to ensure the peg of DAI  Maturity risk control the mismatch of maturities on the asset and liability side Shiftability risk is the failure to get liquidity that was expected from an asset   The first draft of an ALM dashboard is proposed   Introduction We define Asset-Liability Management (ALM) as the tools and processes for optimizing the balance sheet to maximize token holders\u2019 profits while being constrained by a defined risk appetite divided as solvency and liquidity. This document provides a framework to define the ALM problem space. It does not provide a solution as that will depend on MakerDAO community risk appetite. The MakerDAO balance sheet is the core focus of this framework. Below is presented a possible balance sheet structure for the end of 2022 (purely figurative).  The balance sheet is composed of assets and liabilities (+equity, i.e. Surplus Buffer). Assets are used of funds (i.e. investments), we can list the following categories (from the most liquid to the least liquid):  Stablecoins: This includes the PSMs and are our liquidity reserves (the closest thing from a US Dollar) in case of a drop in DAI demand. It is the first line of defense of the peg. It doesn\u2019t provide revenues. Money Markets: Those are DeFi Money Markets investments (like D3M on Aave). It is very liquid as well as it can usually be converted into stablecoins quickly (the actual process is more complex). There is an upper limit as such investment is impacting the lending ecosystem. This provides a low return. Short-term bonds: This represents an off-chain investment in short-term bonds (government or corporate). While profitability is low to very low, it doesn\u2019t impact on-chain interest rates. Liquidity is quite good and the position could be unwinded in a few days with very low to no losses. Crypto-backed loans are currently the bread and butter of MakerDAO (e.g. ETH-A and WBTC-A). While the rates can be changed at will, there is an expectation of low volatility in rates (for the flagship products at least). Liquidity is therefore not immediate if we want to keep customer trust. It is nevertheless still quite short-term (a few months). Profitability is average.  Institutional Vaults are the next MakerDAO product that will offer non-contractual stability for institutions in terms of interest rates (fluctuation limited to 1% every 6 months). This is therefore a quite illiquid product line but provides revenues stability with a low to average profitability.  Real-World Assets (RWA): Private credit investments both off-chain and on-chain. They can\u2019t be liquidated quickly but are expected to provide superior returns and good visibility.  On the liability side, which provides the funding of the asset part, we have only two buckets so far:  DAI: the MakerDAO stablecoin. We also include the DSR in it. The cost of this capital source is very low (DSR is 1bps) but growing demand is quite difficult in terms of product and marketing and can\u2019t be commanded (except by increasing significantly the DSR which leads to other issues). Some part of DAI issuance is stable and some is volatile (subjected to be converted to another stablecoin in case of stress). Surplus Buffer: The capital reserve of MakerDAO which belongs to MKR holders. While there is no cost of capital per se, it can be derived from the market valuation of MKR.   Tokenholder profitability defined First, what do we mean by maximizing tokenholders profits? ALM focus on the balance sheet, hence each balance sheet item will be assigned an annual percentage yield. If positive, the balance sheet item is producing profits. Most assets should produce revenues (e.g. loans will provide interest revenues). If negative, it is producing expenses. Those will be mainly liabilities (e.g. DAI Saving Rate where the protocol incurs an expense to reward DAI stackers).  Using return over equity metric We suggest optimizing for Return Over Equity defined as follows. We weight each balance sheet item value (Vi for the value of balance sheet item i) per the annual yield (positive or negative) of this balance sheet item noted APYi. The sum of all those balance sheet items is then divided by the amount of equity of the protocol (i.e. the Surplus Buffer).  We can discuss incorporating direct costs to the APY of balance sheet items. Indeed, DAI holdings are due to integrations with the wider ecosystem and a brand built over time by marketing. While the APY cost of DAI is 0%, one can argue that marketing costs should be taken into account. On the asset side, Oracles costs are significant and some collateral facilities are at a loss if those costs are taken into account. Core Units costs in general are quite a significant expense. Nevertheless, most of those costs are fixed (or at least not scaling linearly) and might end up being subjective. While those considerations should be used to keep or dispose of a product line, it seems more relevant to stick with pure capital items for ALM purposes. The same goes for structural costs and exceptional items (i.e. liquidations income). As of end December 2021, the balance sheet of MakerDAO is the following (values in $M)  This gives an annual return of $143M which, divided by the equity (i.e. Surplus Buffer so $64M), gives an ALM RoE of 222%.  Comparing RoE with Net Income One consequence of using RoE over broader profitability metrics (like net income) is that it allows optimizing the amount in the Surplus Buffer as well. By construction, reducing the amount of equity is relutive to RoE if, and only if, the price of MKR ($2000 as of writing) is below the equity per MKR ($75 as of writing). The same applies on the reverse but the catch is to find usage for such additional capital. As discussed, the current RoE of MakerDAO is around 220% and it is unclear how to allocate additional capital without decreasing the RoE.  Comparing RoE with Return over Asset (RoA) Another metric that can be used is Return over Asset (RoA). This is the average yield of the assets items. The problem with the RoA metric is that it doesn\u2019t take into account the leverage. Assuming a zero-cost funding, RoE = RoA * leverage. Using the number as end of December 2021, we get a RoA of 1.57%. This could largely be improved by decreasing the PSM, which means decreasing the utility of DAI. This is obviously not a sane course of action, therefore not a good metric.  Comparing RoE with Net Interest Margin (NIM) The Net Interest Margin (NIM) is the weighted yield on balance sheet items divided by the total assets (the size of the balance sheet).  Same as the RoA, the NIM doesn\u2019t take into account the inherent leverage of MakerDAO. Now that the profitability objective is defined, what are the risks that constraint the balance sheet? Comparing RoE with Economic Value Added (EVA) Economic Value Added is a derivative of the Net Income (or NIM depending if we excluded non-balance sheet items revenues/expenses) where we subtract a capital charge corresponding to value that MKR holder expect. It is better than the RoE in the sense that it favors increasing the capital base as long as we can generate value over the capital cost. Nevertheless, there is a great sensitivity to the capital cost input. Moreover, the metric is less easy to interpret.  Solvency Solvency is the constraint of having assets being worth more than liabilities, i.e. DAI being backed. This constraint is built deep into the Maker Protocol. If at any point in time, there is insolvency the protocol will issue MKR token on the market to build up reserves (more precisely removing the \u201cno longer backed\u201d DAI from the market). Maker also has a concept of Surplus Buffer that provides first loss protection. Solvency concerns can be expressed with the following chart.   Expected losses (related to risk mostly) are statistically expected losses and are embedded in the pricing of each product. That means that, on an average year, the profits (after deducting the cost of funds) from a product are greater than expected losses. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to lend in the first place. With the law of big numbers, we can produce strong statistical models. Unexpected losses happen when it is not possible (or not accurate) to use statistical models. The economic cycle can lead to systemic credit risk (e.g. subprime crisis where borrower default correlation goes to 1). Other sources of unexpected losses are market risk (e.g. ETH losing 90% of its value in a few minutes) or operational (e.g. zero-bid auctions Maker endured in 2020). Depending on the level of unexpected losses, 3 scenarios are possibles:  Losses < Surplus Buffer: In such a case, the bad debt is subtracted from the Surplus Buffer. While it decreases the share of the capital of the MKR holders, it doesn\u2019t impact their share of future earnings. If the Surplus Buffer is not enough to absorb the loss, then the system will sell MKR tokens on the market to fill the gap. This lead to MKR holder dilution which reduces their share of underlying capital (which is 0 at this stage anyway due to the previous step) and future profits. If we assume a $2B market cap for MKR and an unexpected loss of $1B, each pre-existing MKR holder will be diluted by 100%. There is a reflexive effect as an unexpected loss will impact negatively the MKR price which will lead to greater dilution, itself impacting the MKR price. Therefore, while it is unclear what level of unexpected losses is sustainable compared to the market capitalization, it is possibly an order of magnitude smaller than current market capitalization (e.g. a maximum $200M loss can be absorbed by a $2,000M market cap). Some early work used the DCF to estimate the possible dilution. If MKR market cap falls below the loss (after Surplus Buffer deduction), then the system is defaulting as it can\u2019t raise enough DAI on the market by selling MKR.    MKR holders have to decide on the size of the Surplus Buffer which will decide the probability of MKR issuance to cover exceptional issues. As the price of MKR is outside the control of MKR holder, it will also define the probability of a protocol failure (but without providing a clear metric of the maximum sustainable loss). On the solvency front, we can identify 5 main sources of solvency risk:  Asset risk Asset risk is the risk of an asset fluctuating in the market. This could be a direct holding of the asset (like Fei protocol is doing ETH) in which case each decrease of the value of the asset is impacting the solvency (as of writing Fei would be insolvent if ETH drop by more than 60%). There is also a recent trend of DAO to DAO swaps where DAO exchange some governance tokens. This would create a market risk exposure to the tokens. So far, this risk is quite limited for MakerDAO as most assets and most liabilities are expressed in DAI. The exception is some ENS tokens in the DsPauseProxy contract, but the amount is small ($1.4M as of writing) and usually excluded from consideration anyway. Asset risk is for fluctuation of the price but orderly markets, in case the risk is not so much asset fluctuation but sudden moves, it is labeled market risk which is the next risk.  Market Risk For crypto-loans, the Risk CU provides a market-driven market risk estimation. It is the risk of capital losses using stressed scenarios (hence falling into the unexpected loss realms as no loss for crypto-loans is expected in normal circumstances). This metric uses market liquidity and a granular level of vault riskiness.  758\u00d7479 82.6 KB  Therefore, Risk CU is providing a direct capital at risk metric that can be used to size the Surplus Buffer.  Interest-rate risk Interest-rate risk is the potential impact, adverse or otherwise, on the net asset value of a financial institution\u2019s balance sheet and earnings resulting from a change in interest rate. A change of interest rate impacts the net present value of an asset that has a non-zero duration. Duration is a measure of the price sensitivity of an asset (debt instrument) with interest rates fluctuations. A duration of x means that the price of the debt instrument move by x% if interest rates are moving by x% (we are using the modified duration definition). Assuming low-interest rates (<5%) and a zero-coupon bond structure (what we use in DeFi usually), the duration is close to the maturity of the debt instrument. Therefore, a zero-coupon bond with a 3-month maturity has a 0.25 duration, a 1-year zero-coupon bond has a duration of 1. At this stage, the mere definition of the market interest rate is almost impossible in DeFi. Is it ETH-A SF? The DSR? Is it money-market rates (Aave or Compound, with or without incentives)? Should we stick with the TradFi yield curve? We suggest considering differently the two sources of interest-rate risk: Real-World Assets and Institutional Vault (IV). For RWA, it should be possible to use the TradFi yield curve. For institutional vaults, we suggest using the reference rate (for instance an ETH-based IV will be based on ETH-A SF). From there we will compute the loss that the \u201cfixed\u201d component of IV will generate. If we have a 1B institutional vault with an ability to increase rates only by 1% every 6 months, an increase of 1% of the ETH-A SF will lead to a \u201cvirtual\u201d loss of $5M (virtual in the sense that the current Maker Protocol don\u2019t account for that). The ETH-A SF, considered fixed going forward, will be used to actualize the loss if this is significant. More elaborated models will be worked on when this topic will be of greater importance.  Counterparty risk The counterparty risk is the possibility that a counterparty will not be able to meet its contractual obligations. We will treat failure to repay a loan as a separate risk (credit risk which is still a kind of counterparty risk but addressed specifically in the next section). The counterparty risk, in this framework, should have a low probability of occurring but with a possible significant loss when it occurs (loss given default being often 100%). Being unpredictable, it will lead to an unexpected loss. For crypto-loans, the Risk CU already monitors the different counterparty exposures. As we can see, the main one is exposure to Circle due to the USDC PSM. The second one is to BitGo due to the WBTC crypto-lending.  744\u00d7527 50.5 KB  Counterparty risk should be kept reasonable by not allowing any single counterparty to be a significant risk to MakerDAO. Sadly, this is not possible yet. Therefore, some key counterparty risks should be listed in a whitelist. We can think of Circle, BitGo, and Paxos currently.  Credit risk Credit risk is the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower\u2019s failure to repay a loan. Using this definition crypto-vaults users are not incurring a credit risk as we don\u2019t expect them to be liable to repay (as we don\u2019t know them in the first place). Credit risk is decomposed by the probability of default (PD), the probability of occurrence of a credit event, and loss given default (LGD), the expected percentage of loss when a credit event happens. Another component is the expected exposure at default (EAD) which represents the amount at risk when the credit event occurs. It is understood that when providing a credit facility, the usage of it will increase just before the default. EAD allows taking that effect into account. Therefore, credit risk is mainly in the realm of RWA and most parameters will be given by the RWA-related CUs.  Liquidity In TradFi, the concept of liquidity is the ease with which assets can be converted into cash. Banks need to be able, at any time, to meet customer demand for deposit account withdrawal. MakerDAO doesn\u2019t have the same issue as DAI are not redeemable for anything (only for $1 of any kind of asset at Emergency Shutdown). Nevertheless, DAI should be worth $1 to fulfill its promise of being a stablecoin. Stablecoin holders should be able to use the stablecoin to buy something worth $1 on-chain or off-chain at any time. Therefore, while there is no contractual liquidity risk, the market demand liquidity DAI (ability to buy/sell DAI for $1 at scale in secondary markets) to be taken care of by the DAO. The history of DAI at par value is studied in another paper. The mitigant for this volatile kind of liability (stablecoin) is to keep liquid assets as reserves. Currently, MakerDAO keeps a huge amount of USDC (and USDP on a lower scale) as reserves as DAI demand is far above DAI supply from crypto-backed loans. DAI holders can get USDC or USDP without a spread (or DAI from USDC/USDP) and from there convert to US Dollar without slippage. This provides a risk-free arbitrage enabling a strong peg. As of writing, such stablecoin reserves represent >60% of the balance sheet which is seriously decreasing our profitability level and is unlikely to be an optimal situation. Liquidity should be strong to sustain any stress but is also costly for MKR holders. Hence the motive to study what is the optimal liquidity. Holding stablecoins as reserves is not the only way to ensure sound liquidity. Influencing market behavior by moving interest rates on both our crypto-vaults (Stability Fees) and our DAI product (DSR) can decrease loans demand and increase DAI holding. Nevertheless, increasing DSR to source some DAI holdings might prove difficult in times of stress. Pushing our borrowers out by increasing their Stability Fees is neither a great outcome as it would put stress on our borrowers. This is not commercially great. Short maturity assets can be a precious intermediary solution. MakerDAO is already providing capital on Money Markets through D3M (Direct Deposit DAI Module). While withdrawing out liquidity will increase the borrowing rate there, the commercial impact is lower as borrowers on money markets are not our direct customers. Still, there is a limit on how much MakerDAO can leverage Money Markets protocol as it could cannibalize its own crypto-loans product line. A TradFi solution would be to use money-markets or short-term bonds investments products to invest the excess liquidity. Real-world money markets and DeFi Money Markets are, at this stage, still uncorrelated. Therefore, scaling wouldn\u2019t be an issue. We will decompose the liquidity constraint into two parts. First is the maturity risk, i.e. the risk of using short-term funding to invest in long-term assets (again assuming DAI is short-term on a behavioral basis and not on a contractual basis). The extent to which this mismatch is acceptable is a parameter that should be set by the community. Then we will emphasize the shiftability risk which represents the inability, due to market condition or others, that a long-term asset expected to be used as a liquidity source is no longer redeemable, sellable at an expected price, or usable for a repo operation.  Maturity risk When dealing with the maturity of the items of our balance sheet, using the more likely \u201ccontractual\u201d maturity is quite deceptive. As already discussed, DAI has no maturity yet we need to keep the peg to remain an ongoing business. It is nevertheless overly pessimistic to assume that all DAI holders will try to get out of DAI at the same block. While the ALM literature provides some solutions, none is applicable directly to a DeFi setting. For instance, the Basel III framework is using the type of deposit account (retail versus corporate, \u2026) to issue a maturity profile (or more precisely a risk of run-off). Believe it or not, the run-off rate of a retail internet account is twice the run-off rate of a retail branch account. Basel III doesn\u2019t provide any guidance regarding smart contracts or DAOs customers. One strength of the blockchain is that, while customers are usually anonymous, their behavior is public (even if making sense of it is not easy). How to define the maturity of DAI remains an open question and will require more work. The same applies to the crypto-loans which are most of the assets of MakerDAO. Those have no real maturity but we could \u201cclose\u201d them by increasing the Liquidation Ratio (1000%+) to the maximum or using a punishing Stability Fee (100% APY). This is nevertheless not realistic if we want to be an ongoing business. You can see below an illustration of MakerDAO current liquidity maturity profile (numbers are only for the illustration). Items on the positive side are MakerDAO assets distributed by maturity. Stablecoins can be sold within a block to meet DAI selling demand (through the PSMs) hence a 1-block maturity. Crypto-loans are distributed between the 1-week (announcement and first rise in rates) to 1-year (people being not rate sensitive). On the negative side, you have the liability items with the Surplus Buffer being at the 1-year+ maturity (actually having no maturity at all) and DAI that are distributed quite arbitrarily around the time horizons. The purple line represents the cumulative liquidity gap for each maturity. If positive, it means that there will be a deficit of asset funding. It will be solved by DAI being below par (speculators being willing to bet on the ability of MakerDAO to solve the balance sheet issue). As we can see, in this scenario MakerDAO has no liquidity maturity risk. This is not a surprise as we have a very strong liquidity buffer currently.  1288\u00d7667 12.4 KB  If we assume the development of RWA and Institutional Vaults (IV), hence a lower liquidity buffer, we could imagine a liquidity maturity profile showing a $1.4B funding deficit at the 1- week maturity.  1288\u00d7668 11.6 KB  As an aggregation of the liquidity maturity profile, we could use the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) which is the ratio between High Quality Liquid Assets and expected 1-month outflow outflows (i.e. net decrease in DAI holding) under a stressed scenario.  HQLA can be both assets that have a short term maturity (stablecoins which have a 1-block maturity or Money-markets instruments). We will use all assets with an expected maturity up-to 1-month.  Shiftability risk As we have seen at the beginning of the liquidity section, one solution to ensure the peg is to keep liquidity reserves, in our case mainly in USDC. Having huge reserves of stablecoins (50% of the balance sheet as of writing) is nevertheless quite opposed to our aim to maximize the balance sheet profitability for tokenholders. The yield of holding a stablecoin is 0%. Moreover, even USDC can be seen as just a proxy of what our customer wants (US Dollars). If the link between USDC and the US Dollar is severed, i.e. Circle suspending convertibility for any reason, those USDC would no longer perform the expected liquidity role for DAI. This would be an indirect shiftability risk, i.e. the risk of being able to convert an asset into liquidity. One solution would be to provide many kinds of liquidity reserves (which we have with USDP and GUSD). Indeed, the Maker Community should enforce diversification in the used liquidity assets. Besides this low immediate shiftability risk (can USDC be converted to US Dollars?), shiftability risk makes more sense when using longer-term investments that are assumed to be liquid enough to meet liquidity needs. We will consider short-term investment and long-term investments separately. On the short-term front, we can see money-market investments, both DeFi and TradFi. DeFi money-market investments are the usage of D3M (Direct Deposit DAI Module) for Compound and Aave. Those money-markets work as a repurchase agreement where the DAI deposited can be lent by the money-market platform to third parties. The borrowing rate is sensitive to the level of liquidity in the pool which should force some level of liquidity. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that DAI deposited could be redeemed within a fixed period of time. This problem grows as MakerDAO is a significant lender of a pool. TradFi money-market would be represented by investment in money-market-like ETFs or money-market-like managed accounts. Shiftability in such a case would be more about the inability to get a good price when needed. There are some rare exceptions where shiftability doesn\u2019t work for money markets or short-term bonds investments. We can recall the subprimes and the Covid crash. The rise of uncertainty in those periods make price uncertain and market-makers, facing the liquidity constrain themselves, are no longer there to provide an orderly market. The key for the future DeFi system might be to manage shitability on long-term investments. The shiftability theory was introduced by Moulton as a new and unconformist (in 1918) way to increase the maturity mismatch of financial institutions. We will illustrate with two examples: one from TradFi and one from DeFi. In TradFi a lot of financial entities are holding long-term assets (like Treasury bonds) but are funded short (e.g. from Money Markets). They don\u2019t face the liquidity constraint because it\u2019s quite easy to do repurchase operations (repo) with a Treasury Bonds. Therefore, even if you can\u2019t/don\u2019t want to sell the asset you can get funding from it. The yield curve being usually upward, the operation provides a profit. The corner case is when shiftability breaks and no repo counterparty can be found. The equivalent in DeFi would be to own ETH by speculating that the price will increase over a long period of time. If MakerDAO would face a liquidity constraint (i.e. DAI != $1), it would be able to repo this ETH position on money-market like Aave or Compound. In case of a need of liquidity, such ETH position will be used on the money market to borrow other stablecoins to defend the peg. While ETH is the best example today, it is likely that DeFi will evolve to provide more term yield-generating products that would provide sound investments and provide great shiftability as well (looking more like Treasury Bonds). Yet, here gain, shiftability works until there is great stress in the market which breaks shiftability (in the first sense or by providing punishing rates). It is too early to have a more detailed discussion, but this is an area to follow carefully.  ALM Reporting If such a framework is accepted by the MakerDAO community, the next step will be to define the risk parameters and provide a monthly (and/or real-time) report to monitor if the MakerDAO balance sheet is within the limits that the community agreed on. This would be useful to warn and take action. While the report could be more detailed, the key metrics will represent the different concepts presented in the framework: profitability, solvency risks, and liquidity risks.     Indicator Description Formula / Constraint     Profitability Capital usage efficiency ALM RoE   Asset risk Asset fluctuation risk over time. Long term 1-year VaR < Surplus Buffer   Market risk Inability to liquidate a crypto-vault in an orderly fashion. Short term Capital at risk (30d average) from Risk CU < Surplus Buffer   Interest rate risk DCF fluctuation due to interest rates change Negative impact of a 100bps rate variation < 10% of the Surplus Buffer   Counterparty risk Exposure to counterparty that can default No counterparty exposure above the SurplusBuffer (except for some whitelisted counterparties)   Credit risk Contractual loans that can default Capital at risk < Surplus Buffer   Maturity risk Inability to provide liquidity to keep the peg Max liquidity gap within 1- month <= 0   Shiftability risk Inability to convert some assets that were expected to be liquid No counterparty exposure above the 10% of outstanding DAI    A current mockup of such a scorecard can be found below. It shows that, in this example, we are taking too much market risk compared to the budget (illustrative, set at the Surplus Buffer level).  This report currently doesn\u2019t aggregate risks (mainly asset, market, and credit risk), treating them as fully uncorrelated. This is not accurate but not significant as currently, only market risk is significant and can be managed by allocating smaller targets for each risk.  Open questions to the community  This framework adapts some traditional finance concepts to the reality of DeFi. Should the framework follow more directly an established TradFi standard like Basel III? How should the MKR minting be seen? Something dramatic that should happen only when everything goes wrong?.Or something that is within the scope of business as usual (i.e. once or twice per year). This will influence the size of the surplus buffer (for the same level of risk). Do you have a view on the constraints, of both solvency and liquidity, that MakerDAO should decide?   Conclusion As we have seen, ALM can be seen as a constrained optimization problem where balance sheet items and the market environment are the inputs and should be arranged in order to optimize value-creation for MKR holders while checking the risk constraint that protects DAI holders. A framework was proposed that led to the first draft of an ALM report. Going forward, the following items need to be addressed:  The risk constraints should be defined and approved by the MakerDAO community; More work needs to be done on a term structure of interest rate in DeFi and comparison to the TradFi one; DAI maturity profile should be studied; A more elaborated monthly ALM report should be presented to the community  ",

It is the risk of capital losses using stressed scenarios (hence falling into the unexpected loss realms as no loss for crypto-loans is expected in normal circumstances). This metric uses market liquidity and a granular level of vault riskiness.   I\u2019ve mentioned this before, but I\u2019ll just add it here as a point of discussion. Would getting some sort of institutional portfolio insurance be a better mitigation for the market risk here? Once the protocol is into \u201cunexpected loss\u201d territory the nominal losses can get quite large (probably even larger than $100MM). However, these should be relatively low likelihood events. That being the case it seems that you would likely make better use of capital by paying some 3rd party to insure the protocol solvency in the event of some Black Swan Event. Assuming you could find a 3rd party willing to offer such a policy. ",

Does the addition of RWAs (off-chain) play an important role in changing this perspective/point-of view?   Our liabilities are \u201ckind of\u201d $4B ahead of our assets. Off-chain investments can solve this problem overnight.

Can it help identify shock absorbers during stress periods?  Can this framework allow the DAO to identify if distressed asset purchases can help expand the balance sheet.   The framework helps to avoid too much leverage by putting risk limits. Risk is providing the capital at risk metric, for instance, it is always considering some stress scenario. Indeed we are taking way more risk than the surplus buffer before the crash last month. Everything went fine. It is up to the community to continue to stay below the risk even when everything looks great. Stress scenario modeling is mainly in the realm of Risk CU. We had almost $2B on Curve, what if the liquidity farming stopped and everyone withdrew their liquidity? Would it be kept in DAI? Sold for USDC or USDT? This would be a huge swing for us. \"distressed asset purchases \" let\u2019s avoid buying MIM  But your point is valid that we could avoid being up to the risk limit all the time and keep a risk budget to seize some opportunities that might arise. But we are not there yet.     luca_pro:  Would you consider splitting the topic into blocks and discuss each with the community through forums or even better AMAs?

We can also extend the conversation in the public channel of strategic finance on Discord.     Andy_McCall:  Would getting some sort of institutional portfolio insurance be a better mitigation for the market risk here?   Sure, it would allow to increase the risk thresholds by the amount of the insurance. There actually was a Declaration of Intent on that but didn\u2019t pass the poll. It is also a question of finding such actor to insure us at a good price. Let\u2019s remember AIG during subprime. ",

                    "content": "Hi @flipflopflapdelegate One quick note on DAI and traditional capital structure and a vector of potential Maker development I am working a bit on. In banking (under basel III) and insurance (under solvency II) there is a Tier 2 capital category (different though for banking and insurance). These are - very very broadly speaking - debt type instruments for loss absorption. I am trying to figure out if there is a way that a drawing right on a DAI vault could be constructed to be admissable tier 2 capital for banks and insurers (loss capital, so on a first principle basis, the DAI do actually not need to be minted at day one in fairness). Or perhaps - more realistically for now - a \u201ccompromise tier 2 debt instrument\u201d could be constructed with some hard cash plus drawing right plus minted DAI in custody. But overall I am trying to deliver a reasonably cheap and efficient admissable Tier 2 capital structure built on Maker \u201ctools\u201d (DAI & Collateralization) that banks and insurers would find advantageous to take up. A good number of issues to be addressed to get there though. Nobody would want DAI drawing rights unless you believe it can safely be drawn and has liquidity to convert into required capital. Nobody wants DAI holdings as loss absorper unless they belive it will retain value and liquidity etc etc. We will try to find short-cuts to manage these issues short-term, but long-term it relates to Maker having exceptional quality risk management, ALM and appropriate capital structure. The really cool part about that is that we can make first principle choices on these matters as we are not under basel 3 or solvency 2 or anything. These requirements all have flaws, inconsistencies and compromises - and move very slowly in changing. A substantial advantage for Maker, I believe, can be built in being a the forefront of risk management thinking and techniques - and using our unique set of tools in achieving stability and safety. An advantage that will allow us to do safe instruments to TradFi that nobody else can - the ruthlessness of the capital markets will then invariably secure adoption I\u2019d venture. At anyrate, I see Tier 2 capital instruments as a not entirely unrealistic way to potentially make Maker/DAI a part of TradFi backbone capital in insurers and banks. If we could put ESG demands on such capital also, well then I\u2019d really think we would be winning. In trying to ensure the shortest distance between idea and realization/rejection, I am right now teeing up a legal counsel and an investment bank to help firm up the idea and see if a solution can be made for test in the market. \u2026just a picture to illustrate - this is % of risk-weighted assets.

Having spent 15 years in FIG I am quite familiar, so are we doing it to reduce cost of capital for MKR holders? There\u2019s no other reasons. The current profitability and valuation framework around MKR doesn\u2019t require capital optimisation as we have seen through the ineffectiveness of the buy snd burn mode, for price sustainability. Although I believe that capital optimisation of some kind will come, I think this is not a priority for the protocol. Understanding the numerator is, ie valuing credit risk and liquidity and other types of risks as @SebVentures is trying to do with this framework. In the meanwhile, having a conservative approach to retain profits as de facto Core Tier 1 capital is the easiest approach. We don\u2019t have RoE problems or dilution problems following regulation pushing us to issue Tier 2 or Alt Tier 1 instruments currently. Happy to engage. ",

                    "content": "Thanks @Allan_Pedersen, I am sure it was me that misunderstood your point. I fully agree with you. But I have an overarching comment. I do not think anybody in the DAO has the required experience to manage a bond book, being it of treasury or of FIG bonds. These areas as you know are highly technical and it doesn\u2019t make sense (in my opinion) to fight against professionals and large institutions. What I think, and I have expressed this many times, is that we could partner with those professionals, in the same way we are trying to sort out the \u2018arranger\u2019 model. In doing so Maker would retain the analytical brain and vote on the major decisions (i.e. investment policy, ALM policy, quantum to be invested/ liquidated etc.), but leaving execution to others. The way I envisage this, is to attract large asset managers, regulated, and convince them to pitch for a segregated account to manage within a specific investment policy. We could do this in a vault construct. Obviously, as you know much better than me, building this bridge is the real complexity. Regulated entities have serious KYC/ AML/ UBO requirements, and we should try to find a structure that satisfies them and the DAO. Whether those structures would be provided by intermediaries such as Monetalis or captively by the same asset managers, is something I would be very keen to have your view on, as well as that of many others. To summarise, I think that systematising the conduit structure between the DAO and the TradFi should be one of the most pressing items in our agenda. Once we do it, then we could collectively decide on an investment/ ALM policy that would draw the box for those intermediaries to operate in. I would not feel comfortable with, or personally endorse, anybody not institutional to manage large pools of capital for the protocol in highly professionalised asset classes.

The last published work to date shows a structure worked out by RWF managed by professional corporate trustees and funds managed by reputable firms. If I was leaning on ETFs it was not due to some fanciness but because both VanEck and Vanguard advised this route regarding our needs (as explained in the post). We discussed SMA as well. For sure avoiding KYC on their end was probably as well in their mind. Moreover, a set of ETFs can be automated, while an asset manager remains a \u2026 human. But all that is more or less irrelevant at this stage. What matters is the underlying and the security of the whole conduit. I can only agree on the real-world conduit, which was the work we made with @christiancdpetersen on the RWA Foundations. A lot of learnings were made. One of the main learning actually was that merging theory and practice is harder than expected. If Blackrock can set up a BVI Trust under MakerDAO executives\u2019 vote direction, take care of the DAI<-> USD conversion, provide an SMA and act as requested by executive votes without any human involvement on our end, that\u2019s the dream. And someone needs to make a version of this dream happen. Therefore, while I don\u2019t agree with @GFXlabs approach, I respect their willingness to work. We should embrace having a community willing to work, this is decentralization. But we need to provide clarity on what it is that we want. I\u2019m working on a MIP for that so the RFC could help shape the need as a community (and to avoid any doubt, I will not do anything). ",

As I mentioned to @Aes, I believe such a project would be better managed jointly by RFC an RWA:  There is a credit risk element in drafting the investment policy that an asset manager should follow programmatically There is a liquidity risk element in both the investment policy and in defining the programmatic (or discretional) triggers to increase/ decrease the amount that should be deployed in the strategy There is a structuring component that is keeping RWF busy on a daily basis while they try to engage structured credit counterparts - actually it is much easier here, given the more programmatic nature of the strategy  For this reason, I am suggesting RFC and RWA to co-lead this initiative. As you know, although I am not currently part of any core unit, I am operating under SES\u2019s incubation program as part of a future Lending Compliance CU, for this reason I would be very happy to be involved, as humble servant of the DAO. I believe my past in the Wall Street industry could be leveraged. I will share my views with you, @Aes, @williamr privately, so that we could converge and propose something to the community to steer our efforts. I hope that my spirit of initiative will be appreciated. ",

As it appears to me the DAO seems to have an implicit stance (adherence) on assets such as renBTC, sUSD, et all \u201ctrustless derivatives\u201d and, by and large, that prevents it from pursuing those assets to mitigate known counterparty risks. As I read this framework I\u2019m having a hard time seeing what here explains that position. Potentially I am missing something. If the official \u201cALM\u201d policy were to say the \u201cexposure to systemically risky derivatives should be bounded by what could be absorbed the stability buffer\u201d that stance might be explained this policy. I.e if solving the counterparty issue through increasing exposure something like sBTC/renBTC were to break some other tenant of the policy then there would be policy pros and cons for the community to weigh and discussion could be had within the context of the ALM. Disclaimer: Again I\u2019m not advocating that anything should be done necessarily (and certainly not advocating for any of those particular assets) I am more looking for some clarification from policy on when exceptions are warranted.

In order to frame the question, MiCA ask for an own funds requirement of 2% or 3% (let\u2019s assume we would be in the 3% rule). Own funds are CET1 instruments for let\u2019s assume it is equivalent to the Surplus Buffer in MakerDAO parlance. It\u2019s roughly the leverage ratio we publish every month (currently at 0.83%). I have no view on whether this regulation would apply to MakerDAO and I assume there would be plenty of other issues.  image850\u00d7214 28.3 KB  From an ALM view, there is no good leverage ratio per see. Nevertheless, the higher the leverage ratio, the higher you can go in the risk/reward curve while keeping the same risk appetite (which is quite low for MakerDAO). This is why the framework is focused on optimizing the RoE (and I have no clue yet on what is the optimal leverage ratio, it\u2019s too early). From a personal view, I\u2019m for a bigger leverage ratio and the regulatory pressure is a factor (but not the only one). If in 5 years we need to go from 1% to 3% on the leverage ratio due to regulatory pressure, it will be quite difficult. And being at 3% already would make us less a target from regulation.

Thoughts: An increase from 0,83 to 3,00 pct to be able to be a credible alternative to fiat (assuming all else equal), the RoE would drop to 62 pct from the 220 pct you mention.

If this is the strategy we pursue, the liquidity constraint should be quite high (let\u2019s say as currently) and better solvency than today (assuming our metrics make sense). This would reduce significantly the expected RoA (Return over Assets). It would also impact the RoE as people would most likely use higher-yielding stablecoins in normal time and we would need to keep ample buffer to be ready for stressed times. I\u2019ve published a piece on a ClearingDAO and that could be the way to be the lender of last resort. Crypto-lending against volatile assets in stressed times is decreasing sharply so there is no need for a lender of last resort in this activity. But we could provide much-needed liquidity to other stablecoins issuers. I need to expand more on this, but it could have some nice benefits like diversification of our liquidity exposure.     Haxelax:  what would in this view be the appropriate RoE in a state where DAI was to become some relevant alternative reserve currency?   The goal of the ALM RoE is not to provide any guidance on the number but just to be optimized to be the highest. For instance, the ALM RoE of Circle (issuer of USDC) is just x4 within 2 months due to the rise in interest rates. It is not safer or riskier due to that. Just more rewarding for shareholders. My view is that Maker is a capital powerhouse. Valuation is usually between 0.5-2x book value (i.e. equity, i.e. surplus buffer). This reflects sentiment in the market and growth prospects. We are quite an order of magnitude above that currently because we are only a startup. At maturity, except in the case of a breakthrough in finance, we will be around that. The Price Earning Ratio that the market will command will therefore be easily converted into the RoE. I think between 5-15%. The ALM RoE (excluding CUs expenses for instance) will have to be higher. Is it possible to be in a monopolistic situation and enjoy unfair advantages (like we kind of are now where DAI is on most liquidity farming programs while our DeFi competitors aren\u2019t)? Sure. ALM can be used to support any strategy. But the underlying assumption is that MakerDAO is a for-profit operation. We want the price of MKR to go up. ",

We provide a CET1 ratio -like on our monthly financials but it\u2019s very crude, all crypto-backed loans are weighted 100%, the risky ones (ETH-B) are weighted 200% and the low-risk ones are weighted 50%. Stablecoins are weighted 0%. Never took the time to search how to model that correctly (margin-loans in the real world). Risk is providing a Capital at Risk metric that is Monte-Carlo-based (or something like that). It is this one that is used in this ALM framework. Probably Basel III can serve as a better guide for Real-World Assets. Feel free to weigh in with your tradfi banking experience. As discussed, I thought first to follow Basel III but I no longer think it is the best path. Happy to hear your thoughts. ",

Banks get liquidated when their CET1 <7% or so, you\u2019re well below that even under a generous interpretation. So I wouldn\u2019t suggest trying to replicate Basel III. The purpose of capital is also a bit different here, and it\u2019s probably not necessary to operate at such high buffers given that there is a mechanism to automatically issue more capital (and dilute existing holders). There aren\u2019t any creditors, regulators or mechanism to force the DAO into bankruptcy (?) so is it acceptable to be insolvent periodically?  What is the holders\u2019 risk appetite for insolvency? I understand there was even a case last year of operating with negative surplus buffer, which in the real world of course is illegal and the end. Liquidity risk is more the issue, and that\u2019s dependent mainly on confidence and operational constraints. Again Basel III probably not very helpful but you could try analysing withdrawal behaviour in times of market stress. The very high ROE is mainly an indication of the very very very high risk here. Increasing capital (surplus buffer) always reduces ROE and risk. Why bank shareholders all love buybacks (burns). Banks have models optimising target capital levels and ROE based on parameters like underlying capital generation and asset growth in the business, taxes etc, it\u2019s all the same issues here. As a general indicator of risk trends the VAR measure is probably better as it takes into account actual asset price behaviour, whereas Basel III is just a rule of thumb (based on historical performance of real world loans). VAR also tells you helpfully how often you can expect to go insolvent which CET1 does not. Tier 2 capital is an arbitrage to meet capital requirements without issuing equity, they are complex debt instruments that convert into CET1 in times of stress and provide \u2018gone concern\u2019 (i.e. liquidation) capital. I\u2019m not sure what the point would be given there\u2019s no regulatory capital requirement. A similar concept though, if there was demand, would be a mezzanine type instrument with insolvency risk to the holder lying somewhere between the surplus buffer and the pegged instrument. Hope this ramble is useful. Interesting to see people bootstrapping basic banking! ",

                    "content": "On the weighting on USDC I agree, in DeFi it\u2019s the closest thing to cash sadly. And it\u2019s big enough for us that it\u2019s one big tail risk. I would also say that crypto-loans are close to repo so probably less risky than 100%. But I agree on the line that those are details compared to our undercapitalization using tradfi standards. On the ALM RoE, it might be a bit deceptive to derive the risk from that. DeFi is not mature at all. Money-market rates are falling and will, at maturity be close to SOFR. There is plenty of institution going to crush the alpha spread. So revenues will fall. On the lending side, in a more mature market, the DSR (yield we offer on DAI) will have to increase as well. But that only means we will have to take more risks to keep a spread significant. Which will require more capital indeed. I also believe VaR-like metrics are more meaningful than Basel 3 guidances. Most risks presented in the framework are based on that. There is also a lot of concern about tails risk. It\u2019s due to the immaturity of the space, lack of possible diversification, and lack of a Fed/government to guarantee at least some things.     Heidi:  There aren\u2019t any creditors, regulators or mechanism to force the DAO into bankruptcy (?) so is it acceptable to be insolvent periodically? What is the holders\u2019 risk appetite for insolvency? I understand there was even a case last year of operating with negative surplus buffer, which in the real world of course is illegal and the end.   A great question indeed that echoes mine on the community view on MKR minting (the other face of insolvency). For instance, Scor, a big reinsurer, is targeting a RoE > 8% and was disclosing a probability of recapitalization of 10%/year (which starts way before insolvency in TradFi). MKR minting once every decade seems like a good target to me. Never stay insolvent and commit to building surpluses when we are not above a safe threshold. ",

We could get the same result by moving some DAI to a Required Buffer or something similar. Is it worth it? I don\u2019t know, the market will certainly not care much at its current level of maturity. The community should provide guidance here.  image1142\u00d7506 114 KB  It kind of matches the graph from the ALM framework with the 95th percentile loss (5% to mint MKR) and the 99th percentile loss (1% to be fully insolvent, i.e. no amount of MKR minting can save you). Numbers were placeholders and the question to the community is really should it be 50th percentile, 90th, 95th, or 99th? I believe 90th or 95th is a great fit at this stage (more 90th but the difference isn\u2019t that big as models are imprecise by definition in uncharted territory). 50th is quite dilutive and doesn\u2019t fit with our brand. 99th is not realistic anyway. If USDC blacklists us we are dead. Good luck figuring out the probabilities for that (0.01%, 1%, 2%?).  Maybe as a comparison, FRAX or Terra are always playing in partial insolvency by design (they are technically insolvent but could cover the gap by selling tokens as their market cap is big enough, at least that\u2019s the narrative). FEI is probably like us but their ability to cover a loss by minting is better on paper (as their stablecoin is far smaller and they are now a diversified business) but most likely less in reality (as they will have to mint when ETH price is -50%).

My main concern is just that \u201callow listing\u201d and forgetting is effectively the same as not caring. One last thing\u2026     SebVentures:  Market Risk For crypto-loans, the Risk CU provides a market-driven market risk estimation . It is the risk of capital losses using stressed scenarios (hence falling into the unexpected loss realms as no loss for crypto-loans is expected in normal circumstances). This metric uses market liquidity and a granular level of vault riskiness.  Therefore, Risk CU is providing a direct capital at risk metric that can be used to size the Surplus Buffer.   Would this risk not be better mitigated by controls around what percentage of the portfolio is made up of \u201cRisk Weighted Assets\u201d or even potentially basel III guidelines as mentioned above. The thing i worry about with the strategy outlined in this post is that it seems to rely to heavily on the SB. The DAO has limited control over the nominal size of the SB, so if the \u201cmarket driven risk\u201d number is ever greater what are you even going to do? Controlling the % of your portfolio that is ostensibly invested in \u201crisk on\u201d assets i suspect is an easier task since you are able to drive inflows into \u201crisk off\u201d assets through changes in the DSR / interest rate hikes. For instance if you imagine the 3 risk categories from blockanalitica as having a risk weighting of 3x, 2x, 1x respectively you might arrive at a risk asset value of something like ~4.1B. If you wanted to say have no more than 40% of you\u2019re portfolio into risk assets you might take actions that would drive down exposure or increase PSM inflows. ",

I also want to share 2 papers from Grzegorz Ha\u0142a  Optimal asset structure of a bank Dynamic balance sheet model with liquidity risk  Both are providing a similar framework but are way more precise and mathematical.

SebVentures:  I also want to share 2 papers from Grzegorz Ha\u0142a  Optimal asset structure of a bank  Dynamic balance sheet model with liquidity risk     as far as this point goes.     SebVentures:  As soon as the Surplus Buffer is below the Capital At Risk you can mint MKR. You can keep a buffer on top as well.   One thing i would advise anyone following this thread to consider is that Capital at risk != to the nominal amount that maker might lose in the event of a crash. See this post on capital at risk from block analitica.  It is computed by multiplying each vault type\u2019s Risk Premium with its outstanding DAI.  It\u2019s basically expected annual income from stability fees. Although a better way to describe it might be \u201cExpected or AVG losses.\u201d My point i want to try to get across here is that while I agree with Seb that you should probably seek additional capital once your cash reserves got that low I also think that you\u2019ve gone into seemingly dangerous territory by waiting that long to do so.

Thanks @Andy_McCall for reading through the model methodology post. I agree with most of your CaR takes, the only point of disagreement is on the model output interpretation and better to clarify this asap. In our model, we do simulate extreme market conditions to estimate financial tail risk which then outputs RPs. We also mention this when describing the jump severity parameter which is used as an input in the Collateral Risk Model. If we didn\u2019t simulate extreme market shocks, the model wouldn\u2019t output any protocol losses/compute zero RPs (which makes intuitive sense given historical data of \u201caverage/expected\u201d protocol ops). Or more to your point: Capital at Risk == nominal amount that Maker might lose in the event of a crash. Additionally, as you mentioned, it\u2019s meant to estimate expected losses, the only addition is that its aim is to do this on the \u201cknowable\u201d tail end (no claim of forecasting Black swans). Expected shortfall, a risk measure often used in TradFi also combines both \u201cexpected\u201d and \u201ctail\u201d concepts. Adjusted to Maker/DeFi (different methodology), CaR can be interpreted similarly. Aligned with the arguments that were already presented, a big reason for using CaR to size up the necessary Surplus Buffer is that whereas portfolio risk profile can change rapidly (change in exposure, slippage, etc.), the revenue stream from RPs is not instantaneous (annualized) which means that losses can occur before the projected revenue ends up in the protocol\u2019s balance sheet. We need a financial buffer to mitigate this risk which is increasingly being brought up as a topic for a good reason. ",

Or more to your point: Capital at Risk == nominal amount that Maker might lose in the event of a crash.   so i don\u2019t want to argue semantics over a model that i have limited visibility into, but unless the methodology has changed significantly over the past year the model simulates drops at a certain level and then the RP is regressed onto the DC based on the severity of the \u201cHedged\u201d drop. If anyone outside of the risk cu wants a look into this model i would suggest taking a look at this sheet where this risk premium calculation was done for the collateral onboarding of UNI-V2-USDT-ETH What I am pointing out and why I am saying     Andy_McCall:  Capital at risk != to the nominal amount that maker might lose in the event of a crash.   Is that the RP doesn\u2019t hedge for drops greater than the \u201csimulated drop\u201d nor does it speculate on the likelihood of a drop of that magnitude. Additionally the fact that it is regressed linearly. If a given collateral were to ever drop more than what is hedged against in that model you could imagine a situation where the protocol is at risk of insolvency. That is why if you\u2019re looking for a threshold at which the DAO might want to consider seeking outside capital CaR WORKS but it is probably a bit optimistic if you\u2019re hoping for a 1000 year DAO.
