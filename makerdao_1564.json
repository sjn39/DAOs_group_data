We will be making a final call on Thursday and updating the community with further information.  Executive Delay For those monitoring the #new-spells channel in Discord, it\u2019s not a surprise that we have run into a few issues with the spell prepared for tomorrow. Ultimately, we are waiting for communication from a trading firm on swapping the most recent batch of 25M DAI for USD. Note this delay is unrelated to RWF-001 and the proposed RWF-0x, and entirely based on our designated broker citing compliance concerns. Ultimately, after discussion with the other @Core-Facilitators (and mandated actors) GovAlpha agrees that the best course of action at the moment is to wait for more communications and plan for a replacement spell to be issued at the end of the week if we do not get further clarity on the situation.  Next Steps CUs and Stakeholders will be in contact with our partners to see if we can reach a speedy solution for the last 25M DAI sent. In the meantime, GovAlpha will not be putting any spells onto the voting portal that include more distributions to the trading partner and will update the community when that position changes.  Questions and Concerns Most pressing (in the view of the mandated actors) is the fate of the 25M DAI sent to the trading partner. We are in communication with the trading partner to figure out what their plan is and how both sides wish to proceed given this new hesitancy for converting DAI for this vault facility. While the legal agreements were put in place to help alleviate concerns in situations such as these, it would not be prudent in our view to continue sending funds without clarity on their fate. I encourage the community to use this thread for further inquiries, and GovAlpha will post links to the following updates here so anyone concerned with the situation can follow allow by turning notifications on for this thread.

Genesis\u2019 compliance concerns were around a technicality in the structure where under Cayman law the Foundation Supervisor is considered a beneficial owner, but from Genesis\u2019 perspective they are not, and they cannot process a trade without KYC on a beneficial owner (even if from their perspective there isn\u2019t one). Boxes need to be checked, even if they don\u2019t make very much sense. It\u2019s all very technical and, in my opinion, has nothing to do with Tornado Cash or any other recent actions. Since I\u2019m contracted by the bank and not the RWA Foundation, I can\u2019t give Genesis direction. I\u2019ve only been acting in a clarifying capacity along with @christiancdpetersen who has been extremely helpful. My next steps will be to work with the Delegated Committee outlined in the  HVB application to brainstorm solutions and ultimately have them provide advice to the Cayman Foundation. EDIT: To be clear about the implications, they are sending the Dai back that they currently have and Maker will need to remove the drawdowns from future execs until this is sorted. ",

It is puzzling because RWA Foundation satisfactorily passed KYC with Genesis before it could even open the account and make any transactions. I also note that RWA Foundation and Genesis, as part of the HVB transaction, actually signed an agreement that pre-determines how Genesis will handle DAI/USD received during the life of the transaction. That was all apparently okay until it wasn\u2019t. I cannot actually provide any further insights because Genesis has not given us the pathway to square the circle. We have provided Genesis with more than enough information (RWA Foundation articles of association, register of members, directors and officers, authorized signatory list for the corporate director, etc.). We have also provided a legal memorandum from Cayman counsel that identifies, for purposes of Cayman law, that the supervisor is the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d. @g_dip and I are evaluating with CES the next steps. But it is deeply disappointing because the \u201ccash flow pipes\u201d worked as designed for the 1st transfer to Genesis and then from Genesis to the RWA Master Participation Trust. ",

We know from public documents and reports that their exposure was in the billion(s) and their parent company DCG needed to step in. Bloomberg reports the facts as follows: Genesis had earlier disclosed that it was exposed to Three Arrows, and a July 9 filing in Singapore high court lists a $2.36 billion loan to the fund from Genesis Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. Genesis sold collateral and hedged its downside once Three Arrows failed to meet a margin call, Michael Moro, chief executive officer of Genesis, said in a series of tweets this month, without specifying the hedging strategy it employed. The loans to Three Arrows had a weighted-average margin requirement of over 80%, he said, without disclosing the total loan amount or the economic loss. Digital Currency Group has since assumed some of these liabilities. \u201cBoth the DCG and Genesis balance sheets remain strong. With no remaining exposure to Three Arrows Capital, Genesis continues to be well-capitalized and its operations are business as usual,\u201d a spokesperson for DCG said in an emailed statement. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-18/three-arrows-said-to-owe-digital-currency-group-1-2-billion ",

I can assure the community that everyone involved with the transaction is working hard on this and that Genesis has repeatedly committed to trying to get this done if they can satisfy compliance. I\u2019m also exploring alternative brokers to facilitate the trade. Either way, we\u2019ll get this fixed and have $100M of RWA in the near future.

Cayman Islands law recognizes the \u201csupervisor\u201d as the beneficial owner.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Sounds like this type of structure does not scale without the approval of centralized intermediaries.   Every structure will be required to undertake KYC. A charitable trust, a STAR trust, a company, a partnership, etc. The Cayman foundation company is not any different.     flipflopflapdelegate:  If so, this structure should have never been considered by MakerDAO.   On what basis? Cayman counsel advised on the use of the Cayman foundation entity over other available options. As you may know more than I, many crypto projects utilize the Cayman foundation as a legal entity. Further, each of the other parties in the transaction chained completed KYC of RWA Foundation without any issue and at least one of them confirmed the same to Genesis.     flipflopflapdelegate:  It also means that MakerDAO getting its money back will also be dependent of intermediaries willingness to comply w/the same orphan structure. Am I wrong?   Genesis has asked that RWA Foundation update the portal with the RWA Urn address so that it may send the DAI back to RWA Urn. As indicated Here, the process has been initiated to have the MKR voters approve the change of wallet address. As a principal matter, for Maker to integrate into real world, the best option is for an orphaned structure. ",
