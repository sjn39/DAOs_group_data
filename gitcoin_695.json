            "body": "\nThe proposal is that a pool of GTC is allocated across the Stewards Council for the term. This is to cover gas costs incurred in voting and offer fair allocation for the group as long as they fulfil their functions outlined above. *The sum is for the whole council for the entire term.*\n\nThe funds can also be allocated to everyone voting as highlighted by some of the comments on the initial version of the council proposal. This action can be decided on by the council as one of their first joint proposals.\n\nThis is a separate Snapshot proposal to determine allocation aside from vote on the creation, members and mandate of the council. Based on the comments on the initial post, an overall agreement was option A. 5,000 GTC for the whole council for the whole mandate. I do want to include all 3 options in this Snapshot for broader agreement.\n\nA. 5,000 GTC\nB. 10,000 GTC\nC. 15,000 GTC\n\n*These options are here for the community to assess what a fair level of compensation might be in the context of the steward council and its mandate.",
