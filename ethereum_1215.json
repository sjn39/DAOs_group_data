During the upcoming hostile push by the EIP-1559 team Tim has been on the 1559-mining Discord supporting slandeorus remarks against miners, deleting posts against 1559, and banning those that oppose them. Below are just a few of the many problems he is creating in the mining community. ALL CONTENT HAS BEEN EDITED TO ENSURE COMMENTS ARE NOT TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT. SORRY FOR THE LARGE IMAGES. Tim works for Consensus which receives money from Defi to work on 1559 for them. Because of this he will not be a neutral facilitator for any meetings discussing 1559 nor should he decide on meeting agendas to include1559. Please draw your own conclusions. image955\u00d7561 76.9 KB Here is a post of a slanderous remark against miners that is still on the board today image1067\u00d7613 93.2 KB Here is a comment made three minutes after sadcat comment that was not deleted or called out for it. However this comment was deleted and the user banned image1066\u00d7384 50.5 KB Here are other users asking why this comment isn\u2019t deleted and the mods (Tim, Piper, Micah, djrtwo, Butta) not saying that it is wrong and still not deleting the post. Tim can be seen at the end trying to justify the sadcat comment by saying \u201cWhen people say \u201cminers aren\u2019t part of the community\u201d, they don\u2019t necessarily mean the individuals as much as to say\u2026\u201d. As if he was speaking for sadcat. image1132\u00d7488 85.4 KB image1129\u00d7371 70.2 KB Finally Tim trying to justify sadcats comment after a number of people objected.  Tim is completely against POW mining the way all coins have mined since the beginning. Here he actually stirs the pot with this comment against miners. image1114\u00d7497 80.9 KB EIP-1057 was blessed (approved) for deployment but was not implemented due to it being a \u201ccontentious fork\u201d. Tim is already admitting 1559 will be contentious but will still push it through anyway and does not care. image1139\u00d7386 70.3 KB Considers miners comments on EIP-1559 \u201cdisruptive\u201d. Gotta say when I went back to try and capture the whole context of this comment my jaw dropped. The comments by fire_kasina were not reprimanded for violating the TOS and in fact Tim backed him up by saying miners have been disruptive. He injected that, not the comment he was responding to, which was a personal attack on miners. image1123\u00d7430 68.6 KB As of today the majority of the community are opposed to 1559 by 62% margin. This means Tim KNOWS it will cause a chain split but continues to push it. image1134\u00d7625 75.1 KB ",

These screen shots are taken out of context. Generally, without context, these would even not be usable in any proposal you would make on an ACD call. Placing these screen shots here in this way is not appropriate IMO. Making a case like the one which you wish to make is a delicate matter and would involve making a well-crafted case to the ACD and others involved in release management e.g. Cat Herders. I understand that you feel strongly about EIP-1559 and believe him to be biased, but please be respectful as you proceed with this effort. ",

What I do believe is wrong is putting someone who has allowed exclusionary statements from the people that he is supposed to be managing and moderating have a position where those biases can do much greater harm to miners. He might not be a bad guy, but he let himself get wrapped up in controversy that should be disqualifying. ",

The role in the current shape and form is meaningless since there is no conflict resolution process. A coordinator is someone who helps to coordinate a compromise based on formal conflict resolution rules. The current position is an engineering manager that executes what is communicated from the top. The root of the problem is a lack of formal governance.  People are good, governance is bad. ",

The outsized role that this company plays in 1559 is ethically troubling, and the fact that no disclosure has been made, particularly in the whitepapers and, what I would call \u201copinion pieces\u201d authored by Tim, is equally disturbing. If you start off a paper by saying, I work for X company, and the technology I am proposing will benefit my employer financially/via efficiency/whatever, and\u2026here\u2019s why I think this technology is a good idea - it gives the reader appropriate context to decide how credible the clams are, if there is (or is not) an inherent bias and which topics or sections to view critically. Many of the claimed benefits of 1559 have been subject to very objective criticisms which have been responded to with articles mostly by Tim, again with no employment affiliation/possible conflict disclosure.  This is, in my opinion, unethical.  The fact that Consensys makes metamask and 1559 is very closely tied to that technology makes it even more so.  I don\u2019t fully understand how Consensys makes its money, and if it will obtain any advantage for metamask with 1559, but frank and honest disclosures by the Consensys team are warranted given that they have played central and critical (almost exclusive) roles in proposing and advancing 1559. Maybe absolutely nothing is going on.  Maybe there\u2019s no nefarious connection at all.  However, the fact that an employee of a private company basically runs the entire development effort of Ethereum and continues to push an agenda with no disclosure of any potential conflicts just really looks bad.
