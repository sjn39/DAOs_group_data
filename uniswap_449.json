If that is correct, it makes sense to launch a discussion and do another temperature check - and see if there\u2019s a consensus on it. It would save a lot of people a lot of time. ",

It\u2019s built to be replaceable by governance, and Compound (which Uniswap governance is forked from) has already done so once.
