Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates.  Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  Volatility in markets ramps up liquidations The recent drop in the cryptocurrency market has left several vaults undercollateralized, kicking off dozens of liquidations over the last two weeks. To participate in auctions, check out MakerDAO\u2019s Auction Portal from the SideStream Auction Services Core Unit, and please see MakerBurn for more information on individual auctions.  New Silver shares bright outlook for 2022 @prankstr25 recently posted an update from New Silver on their efforts to onboard Real-World Assets to the Maker Protocol. In December, New Silver received 247 applications and closed on 16 loans. Those loans represent $3.7 million in volume at an average interest rate of 8.7% over 12 months. New Silver\u2019s debt ceiling stands at 20 million Dai, of which 10.7 million has been used.  21 new polls up for vote! Twenty-one new polls are going up for a vote this week. Five of the polls end on January 13, and the other sixteen last until January 24. The polls cover a wide variety of proposals, including Community Greenlight polls for new collateral types, Ratification polls for new Core Units, and changes to a variety of system parameters. Please head over to MakerDAO\u2019s Voting Portal to read the polls and cast your vote.  Discussion on the use of stablecoin treasury resurfaces with new proposals @GWintery starts a new discussion on Utilizing USDC in the PSM just days after @GFXlabs published a pair of proposals to onboard US Treasuries as collateral (12-months and 2-10 years). MakerDAO currently holds over 3.5 billion USDC, 499 million USDP, and 4.9 million GUSD in reserve, thanks to MakerDAO\u2019s Peg Stability Modules (PSM). @GWintery\u2019s discussion brings up several ways the funds could be used, while the proposal from @GFXlabs would use the funds to purchase US Treasury obligations.
