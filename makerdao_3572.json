                    "content": "Hi Everyone, Presently, we have determined to burn approximately x% (eg. 25%) of accumulated protocol revenues accruing to the surplus buffer via FLAP auctions up until a new maximum (eg. 60M DAI). In order to do this we have set a target in the future based on historical revenues in which to slowly increase the surplus buffer up to the new maximum. For example, the protocol is bringing in 400k DAI per day. We want to increase the buffer every day by 300k DAI so that 100k gets auctioned off. This will take ~100 days at the current rate. This is where the lerp module comes in.  The Lerp Module  The lerp module is the smart contract that calculates and executes the ability for the surplus buffer (as well as any other realistic use case) to increase at a pre-determined rate. To use it is quite simple.   Simply navigate to this contract on etherscan. Additional lerp contract can be found here.   Connect your wallet of choice via Web3.   Once connected, expand the \u201c5. tall\u201d category and click \u201cwrite\u201d.   Finish by executing the transaction.   Voila! The surplus buffer will now have increased based on the calculation set within its code.    Conclusion  I created this simple tutorial mainly as a searchable reference point for community members wishing to maintain and contribute to helping the protocol. Please let me know if you have any feedback. I hope you find this useful. Thanks! ",
