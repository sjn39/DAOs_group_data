Once there is discovery, assuming it gets to that stage, there should be a fair amount coming out. And I suspect other exchanges and platforms will be next. One of the intriguing things to me is how the SEC is almost using these defendants as a way to get to some other issues, like essentially saying certain tokens are basically securities or something close to it.

Also, procedurally, it gets messy because there is a related criminal case being presently prosecuted so there really is a lot at play. Some might argue the SEC is making noise so they still are as relevant as the CFTC which might be given more power (and money).
