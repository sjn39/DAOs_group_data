Highlights of the Month   220513_MakerDao_Nature POAP1179\u00d7826 58.6 KB  1) Nature \u2014 a Brand initiative for Maker Vault owners.  We designed the whole Nature campaign and coordinated the execution of all needed assets to make it work: narrative, website, integrations with POAP and One Tree Planted, etc. We developed the announcement strategy through MakerDAO Twitter, Maker Growth Twitter, and Bankless Publishing. At the time of writing, Maker Vault owners have minted 284 POAPs and planted 117 trees through this initiative.   Thanks @Uncle  for helping the planet! 2) PR \u2014 we began positioning MakerDAO in the international media  The Brand Team was approached by several journalists and media channels to discuss the Terra/Luna crash from the MakerDAO\u2019s perspective. Thanks to our PR help, many media outlets have covered the Terra/Luna crash story with input from MakerDAO via quotes and interviews. We were offered a speaking opportunity on the Permissionless\u2019 stablecoin panel, where Sam MacPherson participated. This participation also had media coverage. For further details, please visit our latest PR Updates.  3) MakerDAO Twitter \u2014 growing metrics  Since we started managing the official MakerDAO Twitter account, we\u2019ve reached sustainable growth on its overall metrics. During this time, the MakerDAO Twitter account gained over 24,000 new followers, surpassing the 200,000 follower mark. Since the last tweet from the Maker Foundation times, we are witnessing record levels in monthly Impressions and Engagements metrics.

We had record highs in Impressions and Engagements during the last month. Due to the Terra/Luna crash, the MakerDAO Twitter earned organic attention from a new audience. We noticed that and responded with reports and important information that positioned us in a safe perspective during this difficult market context. Based on our top-performing tweets, we learned that our audience is interested in knowing how the different components of the Maker Protocol work (educational content) and what the status of the Maker Protocol is (informational content). From there, we created a content strategy based on these 2 pillars: information and education.   Top Tweets from May by Impressions:  StarkNet Dai Bridge Announcement. MKR listed on Celsius. Status of the Maker Protocol after the market downtrend. Mastercad x ConsolFreight x MakerDAO. rETH & sETH2 Collateral Onboarding Processes.   The MakerDAO Announcement Table    During the month of May, we\u2019ve managed and executed 7 important announcements:   MakerDAO is sponsoring Hack Money 2022 - May 3  Mastercard taps DeFi through MakerDAO & Centrifuge - May 10  WSTETH-B Vault Type onboarding - May 16  Celsius listed MKR - May 20  StarkNet Dai Bridge on Mainnet - May 30  Nature Initiative - June 5  MOMC Committed not to increase Stability Fees for several Maker Vaults until August 31st - June 9     Current status of the MakerDAO Announcement Table: Since we are currently working to coordinate all of the major MakerDAO announcements for our Twitter and media audience, we created a workflow that treats each announcement as a project, and whose documentation process is publicly updated through this Notion database called MakerDAO Announcement Table. You can access this public table via announcements.makergrowth.com  New Project - 2022-06-22T132205.6851437\u00d7843 87.9 KB   The Brand Team Ongoing Initiatives    New Ad on Bankless Podcast: We\u2019ve developed our first advertising action through the Bankless Podcast.

From there, we created a content strategy based on these 2 pillars: information and education.   Hey, my name is Colby Anderson. I am currently the facilitator of the incubating core unit, Maker Academy. We have been creating educational content for the past few months as well as creating an online academy where people could go to learn. In addition to showing our own content, we will show content that SES is making and PECU is making. Perhaps, Growth could set up a meeting with Maker Academy to ensure there is no duplication of work going on. We could also show you some of our features to see if you would like to utilize them when developing your own content. My discord handle is colbyanderson#8887 The link to the Maker Academy discord is MakerAcademy ",
