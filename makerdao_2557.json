Our community on Reddit has served as a place to discover and learn about the Maker Protocol for years now. It is still a place where many newcomers lurk to learn more information, ask questions, and share their own opinions and insights. A quality moderator that posts often, shares links to resources,  is consistently present, and is mindful about the health of that subreddit would be a huge help and a great force in the community. image820\u00d7623 82 KB If you\u2019re interested in this role and want to earn some extra Dai week to week reach out to me on rocketchat.

I suggested we add /r/MakerDAO reddit to sourceCRED  if possible. ",
