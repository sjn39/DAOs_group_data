                    "content": " Protocol Engineering Month in Review: May 2021 Our first month as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit has seen some wild market fluctuations that have led to extensive discussion and debate about the robustness of Maker Liquidations. As the following illustrates, the team has continued to work not only on Liquidations but also on a variety of other initiatives across the protocol. This list serves to summarize the work completed during the month of May and provides a useful overview. Please feel free to review, ask any questions you may have, and we look forward to continuing this work in June!  Weekly Executives The month of May saw the usual Executive Proposal cadence. There was some delay passing the initial Liquidations 2.0 activation executive, however it was all in time for the sudden market downturn. Thank you to the other teams that worked with us to get these proposals up on the portal each week.   April 30: Liquidations 2.0 Activations and Oracle Feed Changes  May 7: Liquidations 2.0 Activations, Transfer May Core Unit Budgets  May 14: Parameter Changes and Oracle Updates  May 24: Approve May 2021 Governance Cycles  May 28: Urgent Changes, Oracle Whitelisting, Liquidations 2.0 Activations   Disclosures and Postmortems The team identified two potentially problematic threats to the protocol and therefore highlighted a number of mitigations based on a root cause analysis. This work identified what triggered the oversight and includes future considerations for improving our processes and ways of working.  End.flow() Overflow Bug Postmortem Emergency Shutdown Module and End Module Upgrades and Disclosures   Liquidations 2.0 Deserving its own section this month, Liquidations 2.0 underwent final parameter tweaks documented in the following forum posts:   MIP45 Parameter Changes and Updates  Adjustments to the tip parameter as final change to incentivise kicking off auctions   Auditor Engagement The Team conducted extensive back and forth discussion with auditors leading up to the release of the new auction mechanism. This included the following 3rd parties, all of which can be found on security.makerdao.com:  Quantstamp Trail of Bits ChainSecurity  Gauntlet for additional Economic Simulations   Keeper Development Working with the Integrations Team, we made final enhancements to the backstop keeper ensuring there was a supported ecosystem participating in Liquidations:   Backstop Keeper Enhancements as an example implementation to interact with Liq2.0  Updated Exchange Callees to support flash loan functionality within Liq2.0 auctions   Updates and Upgrades The Maker protocol requires updates to support the addition of new collateral types as well as weekly changes to parameter values to ensure safe operation. These are often needed across Kovan and Mainnet, and this month included:   Dss-deploy-scripts updates incl. tolerance, parameter, value changes etc  Spells-Kovan upgrades incl. new collateral types, authorizations, tests etc  MCD-Changelog updates incl. updated contracts and collateral types etc  DssExecLib Office Hour logic Updates for improving office hours implementation   Smart Contract Development The team reviewed and improved a number of important contracts, including:  DssVest Contract, testing scripts and forum post  Keg contract review, was superseded by DssVest  Delegate Voting Contract team review and improvement  MIP22 Centrifuge Direct Liquidation Module review/discussion with Centrifuge team  SushiJoin Adapter CropJoin + SushiJoin variant  Flash Mint Module incl. team review, update and preparation for release   Collateral Technical Assessments The following collateral types were reviewed this month. Thank you to Seb for preparing the Centrifuge collateral types for our review.  SC math review of MIP21 Trust Company RWA001 [SLP-USDC-ETH] ERC20 Token [SLP-WBTC-ETH] ERC20 Token [SLP-DAI-ETH] ERC20 Token [RWA003/CF4DRP] CF-DROP/MIP22 Token [RWA004/HT2DRP] HTC-DROP/MIP22 Token [RWA005/FF1DRP] FFT1-DROP/MIP22 Token [RWA006/PP1DRP] P1-DROP/MIP22 Token   Layer2 Development Layer2 discussion has really heated up this month with a variety of Layer2\u2019s growing in TVL. We\u2019ve been focusing on getting the initial Optimism Dai Bridge configured, while also working towards a multichain strategy:  Optimism Dai Bridge: Continuous Integration Testing, Slither CI Testing   A Multichain strategy and Roadmap for Maker forum post Subsequent discussions with other Layer2 contenders following our post   Oracles Interaction The team completed a number of audits and improvements to oracle operations:  LP Oracle Token audits  MegaPoker and OmegaPoker (Kovan) which ensures that oracles are being correctly updated   Overhead and Management Meetings In addition to the above development and reviews, much of this month included discussions covering;  Liq 2.0 Coordination with Integrations, Partners, Keepers and liquidity providers. Taking time to create tooling that maps out existing authorizations to improve security and visibility into contract authorizations. The team did a review and update of the Collateral Framework List for the Smart Contracts Domain. We are in the process of moving smart contract copyright to the DAI foundation. This is an incremental process as various code moves from external repositories. The team has also engaged in Growth Core unit discussions exploring whitelist vault options, and L2 exploratory discussions.   Team Admin A small detail worth mentioning - our team multisig has been transferred to the PauseProxy, meaning that Governance, if it so wishes, can vote to remove our access to monthly funding.   Protocol Engineering Core Unit Multisig added to DSPauseProxy ownership   New Hires We are pleased to announce three new additions to our team. They come with extensive smart contract experience, exposure to Layer2 technologies and engineering best practices. I look forward to welcoming them into our team as they join us during the following months, and will let them introduce themselves in upcoming calls and/or forum posts.  Julien Tal Olivier   Team Finances Our first month closed within budget, for transparency the following is a summary of transactions:  We converted 50k DAI into ETH to support current and future gas costs We transferred 8k DAI as payment to a 3rd party tooling provider that will be helping us with our Holistic Safety and Security Strategy  We transferred 20k DAI to the Liq2.0 Keeper to ensure that a keeper was funded to kick auctions. Once the tip parameter is updated, this should not be needed. The remainder of the transactions were for team member salaries, some of which have been deferred to June due to delays setting up corporate accounts.  Thank you to the community for all your interaction in the forum and on RocketChat since we\u2019ve become a Core Unit. A reminder that we also hold an office hours meeting, 3pm UTC every Tuesday for those that would like to drop by, have a chat or ask questions  . The invite can be found on the Community Calendar.

Overall, this was a productive month despite some development time being lost as a result of the Sushi team pivoting to a new AMM that introduced custom ranges to LP tokens. A summary of the month is as follows: Executive Spells  July 23 2021 Centrifuge Asset Onboarding  July 17 2021 FLAP Auction Adjustment and RAW-02 (NS-Drop) Debt Ceiling Increase  July 2 2021 Rates Changes, July Core Unit Budgets, and PSM DC-IAM   Smart Contract Work   DssVest: ABDK audit completed, incorporated feedback, and consistency improvements along with supporting Fuzz tests and proofs. dss-Crop-join updates, including a generalized clipper to prevent inheritance and ongoing formal verification proofs.  managed dss-gem-join with updated exit functions  dss-exec-lib enhancements  including lerp support  Delivery of the Optimism Dai Bridge, including: Dai Address deployed on Optimism, along with deployment Scripts including permissions and safety checks, Tests for the Governance L2 spell, Fuzz tests, and a ChainSecurity Audit  DssFlash and DssVest added to DssInterfaces  Working with Centrifuge to test DROP Tokens on Kovan   ds-pain to support dapphupp updates and dependency management  slosm Prototype lightweight OSM for providing delayed feeds Vote Delegate enhancements  Keeper implementation of Uniswap V2 LP tokens  ClipperCallee implementation for SushiJoin and Fuzzing tests Institutional Vaults: DssCharter contract to support institutional vaults and long term vaults, along with discussion with Risk and Growth CU\u2019s for a Forum Post   Collateral Evaluations  Staked Eth (StETH) Technical Assessment Forum Post  MATIC Technical Assessment Forum Post  GUNI-DAI-USDC Technical Assessment Forum Post   Documentation   EVM Bytecode Programming HackMD guide to deploy bytecode contracts Layer 2 Risk Framework Forum Post  Faulty 2021-07-16 Executive Spell Postmortem  ESM Governance Permission Revocation Bug Postmortem   Infrastructure   Changelog updates to include ILK Registry and new collateral types. Goerli node testing and setup by the team in preparation for Kovan sunsetting  Layer 2 Specific  Internal team research into Oracle options on Optimism Ongoing work to implement the Arbitrum Dai Bridge Actively working with StarkWare to create a new independent core unit  Worthy Mention: EthCC During the 3rd week of July, some members of the Protocol Engineering team travelled to EthCC to meet the Ethereum community. Aside from attending technical workshops such as the Geth Workshop, we had productive meetings with many ecosystem partners, including but not limited to:  Lido; to discuss onboarding Staked ETH Witnet; to explore Oracle and Keeper solutions StarkWare; to discuss extending DAI on StarkNet Institutional; learnings with Aave and Uniswap Certora; to talk about formal verification proofs Optimism; to celebrate our recent Dai bridge and talk about future developments Gelato; to discuss GUNI and collateral onboarding  Last but not least, it was productive to meet with Oasis, TokenFlow, Growth and SES Core Units to discuss current and future work. It was also of particular pleasure to meet moneysupply, elpro, schuppi, saint.burban, Mariano.Conti, david.hoffman, swakya and other community members, where stability fees, NTFs, AMMs, collateral, yields, Layer2s were all hot topics of conversation.

Also, not to pick on the little things\u2013but for some folks that stop-by here\u2013would it be possible to get a simpler explanation to what is being done when you say, changelog updates 1.9.2, 1.9.3, or \u201cUpdates to dss-deploy by updating CALC_FAB on the chainlog\u201d\u2013I find myself going to GitHub and I still have to bear down to figure out what exactly is going on haha  A good example of folks asking for where Maker is headed is this question submitted: will we be able to generate and pay back DAI on Arbitrum based of our vaults which are still on L1 Ethereum?

For future iterations I will include a bit more human readable text for awareness/description as it will help give a bit of colour to what side tasks are required to support the headline items we work on. Thank you for the feedback! In this instance: 1.9.2 - Included RWA address updates on Kovan and mainnet, including the input conduit (where broker dealers send DAI) and the output conduit (which has the Draw function ability to send DAI to broker dealer accounts as approved by governance). 1.9.3 - Included adding VoteDelegateFactory into the changelog so it is visible on the page that developers use to reference official MakerDAO smart contracts. 1.9.4 - Added MATIC to the changelog and updated IPFS links as a source of truth. Regarding Competitive Strategy; In the short term we are immediately focused on the following, as top of mind:  DssCharter (audit review and deployment) D3M undergoing team and audit review Arbitrum DAI Gateway (imminent! - this is a big focus point this week) stETH/ETH Curve pool investigation G-UNIV3-DAIUSDC prepping for poll next week  Zooming out a little - L2 is the main development area getting a lot of focus and has significant attention (namely fast withdrawals). As part of this we are working with the Oracles team to determine optimal message passing approaches. Possibly not as flashy, but the team are also looking at automating certain technical aspects of collateral onboarding (we call it creating factories which allow easier deployment of new collateral types including RWAs), we\u2019re also working on cropJoin enhancements to support new reward earning pools. We also have some brainstormed ideas for NFTs, liquidation enhancements and Governance (dssGov) but these are not formally on the roadmap - would be something we\u2019d put in-front of Governance first.

                    "content": " Protocol Engineering Month in Review: June 2021 The following is a summary of Protocol Engineering team efforts for the month of June. As evidenced by the numerous code submissions, especially with respect to CropJoin, SushiJoin and Optimism contracts, we\u2019ve been pretty heavily engaged in reviews, updates and enhancements across the board. Team discussion also moved towards increasing and broadening the DAI supply through conditional vaults and new collateral types. Similarly, L2 progress has been strong, involving close collaboration with Optimism, Arbitrum and StarkWare.  Weekly Executives Only three executives in June as we shifted the last executive (PSM autoline) into July:   June 4th: June Core Unit Budget Distributions, Other Changes (including Liq2.0 and PSM)  June 11th: Parameter Changes, Oracle Whitelisting, Other Changes (PSM DC, ETH vault parameters)  June 18th: Flash mint Implementation, Debt Floor Changes   Smart Contract Development A diverse list including periphery modules, proxy contracts, collateral adapters and interfaces:   Uniswap V3 Periphery Contracts: Peripheral contracts enabling profit reinvestment  Vote-Delegate: Contract updates, testing and the addition of a 1year expiry parameter  Flippers changed to Clippers for Stablecoins: Removed tech debt and updating all collaterals to Liq2.0  Updates to CropJoin and SushiJoin: New naming, manager implementation, and proxy patterns  DssFlash: Completed testing on Kovan and deployed the Flash Mint Module  DssProxy Actions: Updated integration with CropJoin, CdpManager, Sushi LPs and PAX-G  Direct Deposit Module: Enhanced gem redemption in the event of protocol shutdown  Oracles IAM: Created a solution allowing the addition but not removal of reader authorization  Adding Permissioned-Gem-Join: Updated for authorized users to interact with a join adapter without granting full auth access  Dss-Interfaces and Dss-Deploy-Scripts: updated to support DssFlash  PSM DC autoline: Introduced an IAM debt ceiling autoline to the PSM   Layer2 Development Our primary focus remains on delivering Optimism and Arbitrum as they are technically very similar. We have a number of dependencies with these teams as they wrap up their deployments and audits.   Optimism-dai-bridge: Fixes, fuzzing tests and improvements. Deployment is imminent! Arbitrum: Ongoing work for the Arbitrum Bridge (still private repo) StarkWare: Exploring options to bootstrap StarkNet development   Keeper Development With the move of the remaining collateral types to Liquidations 2.0 we had a final task to update the auction demo keeper:   Auction-demo-keeper: Support and enhancements for new collateral types   Auditor Engagement Ongoing engagement to ensure code correctness for new implementations:  ChainSecurity: Optimism-Dai-Bridge reviews and work on internal deployment scripts  ABDK: Vote Delegate review completed   Forum Posts and Documentation   Architectural Debt Cleanup: Migrating Remaining Collateral to Liquidations 2.0  Flash Mint Initial Parameters: Max set to 500m DAI and toll set to 0.05%  Defined Numerical Ranges Document: for all dss parameters and quantities ESM Postmortem: team discussion - pending publication Oracle Tail Risk Mitigation: team discussion - pending publication Staked Eth Technical Evaluation - pending publication   Internal Team Training  BlockScience: DSR scenario analysis, entity relationships and system modelling Certora: Extending proof assessments of the DAI Optimism-Dai-Bridge to ensure variables are consistent and that there are no code violations.   DAI Supply Discussions Worthy of mention this month are discussions that have been occurring between Protocol Engineering, the community and Mandated Actors exploring possibilities for increasing the DAI supply. This has led to focussed work regarding CropJoin and SushiJoin, and will lead to immediate work on defining conditional vaults in the coming week.  Team Admin and disclosure As introduced earlier this month, we welcomed two new hires; Tal and Julien. Both have been instrumental in writing and reviewing executive spells, conducting collateral assessments (StakedETH) and contributing to the team. We are super happy to be extending the team\u2019s capability! Protocol Engineering team finances are temporarily trending slightly below budget due to outstanding payments to a number of team members and 3rd party auditors and tooling providers. We expect to clear KYC requirements to be able to make these outstanding payments within the coming weeks. ",
