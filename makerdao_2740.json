Up to now, the foundation has supported all Maker protocol development presumably through spending the funds stored in the Maker multisig, which currently has ~$50m remaining.   I am assuming that these funds are earmarked to support the existing, announced activities (e.g. auctions 2.0, voting contract redesign, real world assets).  Its not clear, however,  what the runway is for when the community is supposed to take over from these funds or if all funds in the maker multisig are planned to be spent on development activities. Obviously, if the foundation was out of funds, we would need to urgently divert stability fee income into paying for ongoing protocol development activities.  At this point, it seems like the foundation is still able to function effectively and do great work, but we should start planning and setting expectations for when the community will need to take over financially and what types of activities need to be supported now by the community if they are going to move forward.  If we pay for activities out of the Dai surplus, does this mean that less MKR will be sold from the multisig account?  If so, we need to start having some accounting transparency so that the community can evaluate these tradeoffs effectively. ",

I have raised this point many times in the chat, but when the partnership with a16z was announced (MKR was sold at a discount), it was claimed that they would bring great intellectual value and \u2018contacts\u2019. Is it too much to ask what these contact are? And ask a16z to help the DAO to build the community, to help us hiring a good team of smart-contract coders, etc? I personally never had the pleasure to chat (in the official Maker chat) directly with any representative of a16z. Have you? Do they even vote? But a16z is just one of several investment groups who bought MKR in the past. What are they doing? Are they free to dump their MKR? If not, for how long they need to hold? Etc. ",

If we read the origina blog post:    Maker Blog \u2013 26 Sep 18    a16z crypto purchases 6% of MKR, backing Stablecoin Vanguard MakerDAO - Maker... Signaling their support of MakerDAO\u2019s Dai stablecoin, investment fund a16z crypto has purchased 6% of the total MKR token supply for $15 million USD.      we can read:  As part of this partnership, MakerDAO will receive operating capital through the next growth stage, 3 years of support for the MakerDAO community, and most importantly, full operational support from the 80+ person Andreessen Horowitz a16z team. Specifically, Dai Stablecoin adoption and regulatory support are two of the first priorities. Andreessen Horowitz and a16z crypto are opening up their expertise and network in areas ranging from sales and business development (including partnerships), marketing, technical talent, HR operations, and more. We look forward to being able to utilize a16z\u2019s vast array of resources and knowledge to help guide and build Maker for years to come.  More than 2 years have passed. And we (i.e., MakerDAO community cited in the blog post), as opposed to the Foundation (which is not cited even once, also bacause it did not exist at the time), have no idea of what a16z has concretely done, nor how the 15m USD have been spent (it\u2019s quite a bit of money).

When I hear rumors that the Ethereum Foundation Devs are overworked and underpaid ( not to forget under pressure to deliver Eth 2.0) \u2013 I pray that the Maker Foundation is not making the same mistakes\u2013because I  this community and I could care less what has been done with the A16Z money\u2013or what A16Z does for MakerDAO \u2013 as long as the investment has been put to GOOD use\u2013(like taking care of the Community and Foundation Employees). And IMO\u2013I think it has. Here\u2019s an excerpt from Anthony Sassano on the Trials and Tribulations that Eth Foundation Devs go thru: \"  the number 1 reason seems to be core developer burn out. The core developers are the people who are making sure the critical infrastructure such as the Ethereum node clients are running smoothly and without issue. This is a thankless job as almost no one in the ecosystem actually sees what work these developers do - from low-level protocol and node software optimizations to putting out fires that you didn\u2019t even know were there. These people are under an incredible amount of stress to ensure that the network keeps running smoothly so this has led to some burn out which is totally understandable. There is also a lack of clear public communication from the parties involved in the core development process of Ethereum (and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily their fault). I bet most of you haven\u2019t even heard of the Ethereum Cat Herders who actually do put out regular updates and have been for a while! I believe the problem here is that there is no one \u201cleading\u201d marketing/public relations for the \u201cEthereum project\u201d itself - not even the Ethereum foundation - which leads to a \u201cbystander effect\u201d of sorts. What I mean by this is that for Ethereum marketing/PR updates, we pretty much have a situation where there is no \u201cleader\u201d to tell someone to put out these updates so everyone just assumes that someone else will do it. What ends up happening is the community tries to fill the void as best they can but this leaves much to be desired.\" \u2013Anthony Sassano I believe that \u201cWe the Community\u201d-- will do a kick-ass job in making sure this MakerDAO/DAI will survive and change the World for the better, with the help of You & every single community member. I also believe that 99% of people in this ecosystem are Good people. You compare that to other industries and it can be 60-40, 50-50, or worse. All in all I believe that 99.9% of our community is genuine. And at the end of the day\u2013that\u2019s all that matters, IMO. ",

I would have liked to see a breakdown so that the community could look at what things could be taken off the Foundations back as well. Given the lack of any response on this topic my expecation is as follows:    As domain teams come on line, EPCs, Oracle Team, smart contracts, etc. we should start to get some idea of costs. My biggest problem here is that as far as I can tell the DAO itself doesn\u2019t really have a clean mechanic yet for:  Provisions for MakerDAO Treasury (i.e. MIP14 or the like) Connecting (1) to people to manage old and new initiatives using such a Treasury.  I want to link to what @amyjung  etc.are doing with grants for domain personelle etc.   I had a link to presentation but am not sure if this connects.  In the end I suspect Foundation is working to offload - so over time we should have a better handle on this simply by doing it.   My expectation is that doing what the Foundation does now in a centralized fashion will cost 2-3x to do it in a decentralized one. Hopefully someone from the Foundation will offer some insight here as I don\u2019t see how the DAO can just pick up things without knowing what is to be picked up - from an authoriity/responsibility perspective but also a cost and legal one.
