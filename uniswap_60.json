There is literally 0 risk here. Matic is Ethereum friendly. Aave, Curve and Sushi already on it. Many L2s is better than just one L2. While I really love and support the work of Optimism, I see no reason for Uniswap to put all its eggs in one L2 basket (Optimism) at this point. I just can\u2019t see why it would be a bad idea, considering all the congestion. PS : Even with the new licensing scheme, nobody can stop an anon from deploying their pirate fork/version of V3 on L2s. Governance should frontrun such anons. Edit : Polygon isn\u2019t an L2 technically, it\u2019s a sidechain. ",

I agree that it\u2019s not \u201ctechnically\u201d a L2, and it\u2019s really more of a \u201csidechain\u201d. But when Optimism gets delayed for a 5th (or so) time, etc., maybe it\u2019s just time to drop the purism and the haughty take on the ecosystem and just deploy on Polygon as a means to maintain market domination. Maybe they have some kind of contract with Optimism we are not aware of. In any case, they seem to have deep ties with the team. In the Discord AMA the team clearly stated that they were not \u2018maried\u2019 so to speak with Optimism. Maybe it\u2019s time to prove it\u2026 idk. Also, maybe let the users choose which is the best EVM sidechain or L2 for them ? If Optimism is indeed a better solution, I think Polygon will become a ghosttown when it really lands on Ethereum\u2026 It\u2019s an interesting bet to say the least. And it\u2019s pretty much an \u201call-in\u201d bet right now. Like, it seems there are just no possible compromise in their minds. As it\u2019s been highlighted many times now on Twitter, Sushi is basically doing the opposite : taking literally ANY opportunity, opening up to multiple communities at once. And in doing so, beefing up support on social media, etc. (But with clearly inferior infrastructure post-V3). In any event, it would be nice to get a symbolic proposal going. UNI holders signaling support for Polygon deployment or not. Governance doesn\u2019t technically control deployment to other networks. I\u2019m thinking the Optimism public mainnet eployment might be, very soon (still july on their website though). That\u2019s maybe why they want to refrain from deploying on Polygon at this precise point in time. There are just 0 updates from them on their blog, or even on their twitter ! ",
