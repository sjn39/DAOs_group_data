                    "content": "Over the past few months, I\u2019ve heard multiple individuals bemoan the lack of a marketing core unit. For those that are unaware, there is a concrete governance action you can take that should make it easier for MakerDAO to attract individuals or entities wishing to fulfil this role. This action was laid out in MIP13 and was specifically designed to help resolve this issue.  A declaration of intent is a statement that declares an intention Maker Governance has to the wider ecosystem. Such declarations should be made with the aim of prompting action in a certain area. - MIP13c1   The point of this structure is that it allows authors to declare something ie: \"MakerDAO wants to employ a marketing core unit\" And then have it be voted on formally, such that it becomes something that MakerDAO as a whole has declared. This declaration can then be used as evidence / motiviation / etc for potentially interested parties. It can also help guide the structure of any applications proposals.  There is no limit to what a declaration of intent can include. For example authors could include statements in the form of any or all of the following:  MakerDAO intends to reward valid marketing core unit proposals with 10,000 DAI, even if those proposals are unsuccessful. MakerDAO intends to deliver successful marketing core units a 100,000 DAI signing bonus. MakerDAO intends to deliver a 1,000,000 DAI performance bonus after a marketing core unit has 1 year of continuous service. MakerDAO intends to reward valid marketing core unit proposals with 5,000 DAI if they their proposals follow the SES Core Units guidelines correctly, even if unsuccessful. MakerDAO intends for a marketing core unit to respond to requests for marketing support from other core units. MakerDAO intends for a marketing core unit to deliver a cohesive marketing vision for MakerDAO after 3 months of operation. MakerDAO intends to reward the author and contributors of this Declaration of Intent with 5,000 DAI apiece if this Declaration of Intent passes through governance successfully. MakerDAO intends to reward the author and contributors of this Declaration of Intent with 5,000 DAI apiece if this Declaration of Intent is met within 6 months.  Like the possibilities here are only limited by the authors imagination and their ability to convince MKR Holders that their ideas for incentivisation have merit.  Like, you all have the power to make a difference in the DAO, to fix the problems people are seeing etc. In many cases, you can literally write in bounties to yourselves for producing a successful proposal into the proposal itself. The only thing GovAlpha will definitely veto is payments to delegates or voters for voting in favour of a given proposal on the grounds that this can be considered a governance attack. ",
