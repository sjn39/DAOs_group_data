In order to increase diversification of stablecoin reserves, GFX Labs is signaling to raise this debt ceiling to 60 million DAI. This would represent approximately 32% of the outstanding GUSD float, and is in line with what could be covered by the Stability Buffer in a worst-case scenario. An informal consultation with Risk indicated that this was within acceptable range. Pros: -More DAI in circulation. -Another asset in the portfolio of peg management (PSM-USDC, PSM-USDP, Gelato tokens, some UNI LP tokens). Cons: -Material exposure to another centralized, redeemable stablecoin.    Should The PSM-GUSD Debt Ceiling Be Raised To 60 Million DAI?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Next Steps This poll will run until 2022-02-08T05:00:00Z. An outcome favoring Yes over No will result in an on-chain poll. An outcome favoring No over Yes will result in no action taken at this time. ",
