Recent progress   TechOps has begun identification of their critical infrastructure as part of their CU mandate Coordination with the Forta team working with TechOps has begun to evaluate their use for monitoring of other critical infrastructure. Further work on the identification of critical infrastructure in collaboration with DeFi Safety  Bug bounty MIP is posted GovComms CU has developed a draft incident response document, to which we are contributing We continue to gather ideas for educational content  We made our first social media post and have set up MakerDAO channels within the Immunefi Discord In our original Roadmap, we were to post a MIP for our operational security audit in Dec 2021. Since there is no governance cycle in December, we decided to push this MIP to Jan 2022. This will not delay the starting date of the first operational audit.  I want to take this opportunity to heartily thank TechOps and GovComms CUs for collaborating and contributing to our CU\u2019s goals.  Anticipated soon  First regular office hours on December 22nd at 17:00 UTC Technical onboarding of Immunefi Services   Anticipated Jan 2022  Formal submission of operational security and bug bounty MIPs Complete initial review of incident response procedures Complete initial inventory of critical infrastructure monitoring Begin publishing educational content   Anticipated Feb 2022  Backups for critical monitoring infrastructure Fire drill Bug bounty program is live Begin operational security audits   Slides We presented this update as a video (link to be posted). Here are the slides. ",
