Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates.  Online PDF Version  We have some new ideas for improvement and would appreciate your feedback to help make the Weekly Relay more enjoyable publication.     Amended MIP40: Important Information for Core Units From \u201cActual Expenses vs Budget\u201d reports to fifty-comment forum threads on the best way to determine compensation levels in a remote-first, global organization, budgeting is a perennially hot topic in internal MakerDAO discussion. The latest development of the ongoing discussion, MIP40, defines a framework for managing and modifying Core Unit budgets has been amended with several substantial changes. Primary Changes   Budget Submission Windows: Budget Submission Windows is a new aspect of Core Unit budgets outlined by MIP40. Budget requests can only be submitted quarterly in March, June, September, and November.  Budget Start and End Dates: Budgets now have a maximum duration of 12 months and cannot start later than three months after being formally submitted.  Budget Composition: Budget requests are now required to provide more specific details, including:  How revenue growth and/or the potential for improvement in operational efficiency will be increased. How the Core Unit could guarantee viable business if operating Bear/Superbear/Bull context. A timeline for specific deliverables.    Transparency, Return of Funds, Unwinding: To increase transparency, Core Units are now required to:  List expenses by time. Specify the percentage of the budget going toward ongoing and one-time expenses. Disclose the number of members in the unit. In the case of budget increases greater than 10%, including variance analysis. Core Units are now required to return all funds (with qualifications) in excess of three months of budget. Core Units are now required to define how they are to be wound down in the event of a governance vote to defund them, with accompanying rationale (period, use of funds, return of funds).    MIP40c3 Subproposal Parameters: Ratification Polls for MIP40c3 sub proposals no longer use binary voting. Instead, they now use ranked-choice voting with the following options:  Approve existing budget only (business as usual). Approve increased budget. Reject budget. Abstain.    @prose11 commented that a grace period had been established for budgets posted to RFC for the June cycle before these amendments passed\u2014i.e., MIP40 budget proposals will not be required to adhere to the rules outlined in this amendment. To illustrate the timeline, @adcv provided an example of the budget sequence for the March cycle:  Through to the end of January: Design of budget proposal Beginning in February: Post on the forums for RFC within the submission window Beginning in March: Formal submission of the budget March: Vote April: First effective date  GovAlpha will be hosting a public \u201cKnow Your MIP\u201d call for discussion on this amendment in the near future. A MIP4c3 amendment to clarify some points of this MIP is currently in progress. Review the original forum submission for this amendment and the ratification poll for more information. Contact @Gala, @blimpa, or @sebix on the forums for questions or comments.  Beware of the Most Recent NFT Scam Happening!! There\u2019s a new NFT scam where victims receive an NFT airdrop from an unknown collection into their wallets with a 1 wETH offer. The fraud wETH offer allows users to approve the collection for sale, but the offer will revert when they try to accept it, which will waste gas. The revert message directs the user to a phishing site. Keep an eye out for this  and share with the community! For more information, check out this thread.     Executive Vote(s) Raise the ESM Minimum Threshold, MKR Vesting, Adjust the lid Parameter on the Rate-limited Flapper This executive proposal passed, and the following changes occurred within the Maker Protocol:  ESM Minimum Threshold Increase As per this Governance Poll, the ESM Minimum Threshold (min) -i.e., the minimum MKR amount required for triggering an Emergency Shutdown- was increased from 100,000 MKR to 150,000 MKR.

Core Unit MKR Vesting Transfers     Core Unit Amount Budget Proposal     Development and UX Core Unit 355.86 MKR Budget Proposal   Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit 243.7953 MKR Budget Proposal     lid Parameter Adjustment of the Rate-limited Flapper As per this Governance Poll, the lid parameter (which sets the total value of DAI allowed to be sent out to surplus (flap) auctions at once) was adjusted from 150,000 DAI to 30,000 DAI, effectively reducing the amount of parallel flap auctions from five to one.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  Online PDF Version | Show some love to our Medium account   We have some new ideas for improvement and would appreciate your feedback to help make the Weekly Relay a more enjoyable publication.   Check this out!   SES and Julian are researching challenges and opportunities for Maker involving environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG). They are currently asking the community\u2019s opinion to help identify topics with potential business relevance. Check out the survey here. For more information:         Improved Governance Cycle The Protocol Engineering Core Unit has announced that executive proposals will be posted weekly on Wednesdays instead of Fridays. Increasing the time between polling and the executive will give development teams more time to safely deploy any contracts introducing protocol-level changes. Previously, polls have been made available on Mondays to finish on Thursday for deployment on Friday.  The limited-time available to deploy approved contracts led to several impactful issues, including:  It was not possible to adequately test spells on the Goerli testnet Working on two spells in parallel (Goerli and mainnet) is not a best practice It did not provide enough time to review and accept pull requests from other engineering teams  Moving the deployment of spells to Wednesday enables our engineers to address these issues and ensure a safer, more thorough development and deployment process.  In more detail:  GovAlpha will continue to launch polls as they do today, starting on Mondays and ending on Thursdays.  At the same time:  Protocol Engineering will have begun Goerli spell preparation at the beginning of the week, working with CES, Oracles, and others to merge pull requests into the Goerli spell. Protocol Engineering will update the Goerli spell with the spell copy provided by GovAlpha by Friday.  The following week:  Protocol Engineering will deploy the Goerli spell on Monday before starting the mainnet spell targeting deployment on Tuesday. Protocol Engineering will inform GovAlpha of the completed spell, who will then post it on the Governance Portal.  The next executive vote will take place on Wednesday, May 11th, instead of Friday, May 6th.     Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) Weekly MIPs Update #86 by @blimpa  1380\u00d7778 23.2 KB   May\u2019s Formal Submission Window closed last Thursday; five proposals entered it and are now on-chain as Ratification Polls. These will run for two weeks and close on May 23. The latest possible date for posting proposals* that will enter June\u2019s Governance Cycle is Wednesday 11. Ratification Polls will close in two weeks, on May 23. June\u2019s Formal Submission Window opens on June 6.  RFC and FS Dates for reference and existing proposals can be seen on this proposal tracker.

Active Signal Requests Maker Accessing Mortgage loans Through Bacon Protocol This proposal from @abdalla requests the onboarding of a Dai Direct Deposit Module (D3M) to create a Bacon Protocol Dai pool. BaconCoin is a stablecoin backed by US mortgages. Potential benefits include:  A single onboarding procedure that can scale both the amount of capital used and the number of home loans over time Broad distribution of Dai to homeowners in the US Higher risk-adjusted yields across a diversified set of home loans Maker selects the underwriting criteria to use, allowing for investing in loans that are highly aligned with Maker\u2019s vision of funding sustainability initiatives Bacon will develop and maintain the D3M integration in line with the CES enablement strategy Governance has direct control over the Dai supply added to Bacon through the Debt Ceiling  @abdalla lists smart contract risk as a potential con but also offers two ideas for mitigating risks:  Whitelisting addresses with deposit functionality can reduce exploit risk (Maker would be the only liquidity provider) Credit risk assessment of borrowers can be performed by loan originators using the industry-standard FICO score  The vote will run until May 19th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1702\u00d7685 97.4 KB   Increase the ESM Minimum Threshold GovAlpha submitted a Signal Request to gauge support for increasing the minimum threshold to trigger the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) from 100,000 MKR to 150,000 MKR. GovAlpha recommends this adjustment to minimize the threat of a hostile emergency shutdown occurring. With the recent fall in the MKR price, triggering an emergency shutdown has become significantly cheaper based on the current minimum threshold. The goal is to find the right balance between making it very expensive for a bad actor to acquire or borrow enough MKR to trigger an emergency shutdown without making it overly difficult for a legitimate emergency shutdown to be triggered if necessary (for example, in response to the discovery of a critical bug in the Maker Protocol or the prevention of a malicious governance attack). The vote will run until May 20th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1655\u00d7687 109 KB   Antalpha Institutional Vault @William_Chiu has compiled recent discussions between the Growth, Risk, and Protocol Engineering Core Unites and Antalpha to propose a new institutional vault. The post outlines both the goals of the proposal and the mechanisms for achieving them. Goals  Boosting DAI Supply Generating greater revenue for MakerDAO and our partners Enhancing capital efficiency for our partners Longer-term borrowing commitment with a level of borrowing rate-predictability  Mechanisms  Boosting DAI Supply Generating greater revenue for MakerDAO and our partners Enhancing capital efficiency for our partners Longer-term borrowing commitment with a level of borrowing rate-predictability Origination fee: will be applied to all DAI at the time of minting. This is not restricted and is open to change via Governance (specifically the Parameter Changes Proposal group). Meaning that any partner will have a lead time of 2-3 weeks before any changes are implemented. Stability fee: is determined upfront and fixed for a period of time. This fixed rate can be reduced as additional collateral is added. Vault starting size: to ensure that such vaults will mint a minimum amount of DAI to gain favorable rates. Antalpha intends to utilize a DAI loan to strengthen the stable coin portion of the balance sheet to support one of its primary lending and borrowing businesses. Antalpha will take on collateral at a higher level than the level borrowing from DAI to implement proper credit risk management and utilize systems and algorithmic trading to facilitate managing the loans and collateral.  Proposed Terms     Institutional Vault Type Permissioned ETH and wBTC Vaults (INST-WBTC-5, INST-ETH-5)     Qualifying Vault size: 200MM   Debt Ceiling 1B, 500MM for ETH, and 500MM for wBTC   Origination fee: 1% of DAI minted   Origination fee behavior: Origination fee is not restricted and can be changed through Governance via a Parameter Changes Proposal. Antalpha has a 2-3 week lead-time to any Origination fee rate change.   Origination fee future commitments Maker and Antalpha will work together to propose reductions to the origination fee if the vault size grows significantly.   Stability fee: WBTC-A stability fee1 - 50bps & ETH-A stability fee2 - 50bps   Stability fee3 behavior: Fixed for six months. After the 200m DAI minted, an additional 100m DAI minted will reduce the stability fee by ten basis points (per vault) to a minimum of Stability fee-30bps for six months. The stability fee reduction will be manual via an executive vote. After six months, open community dialogue facilitated by the Growth CU will determine ongoing stability fees.   Collateral Ratio: 150%   Collateral Ratio Behavior: Failure to maintain 200% CR4 over the majority of seven days will increase the SF to 5% and the LR to 150%. The seven days would be calculated by ensuring that 95% of the OSM updates show that the CR is equal to or greater than 200%.   Liquidation Ratio: 120%    The vote will run until May 19th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1697\u00d7680 111 KB   Restart The Burn @aburban90 presents his request in favor of reactivating the MKR burn. He states that shutting down the burn also shut down our only revenue distribution model and that we have yet to replace it with anything better. These actions have caused some OG stakeholders to lose faith in our ability to deliver. Our community and stakeholders are very important, and there is a possibility we may be risking their confidence in us if we continue not to burn MKR during times of such low prices. In conclusion, Andrew asks the community whether we want to restart the burn with a reduced lid parameter to mitigate many of the inefficiencies. The vote will run until May 14th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1697\u00d7902 179 KB   Deploy the balance sheet in ETH As expressed in Towards taking asset risk and A balance sheet approach to an Aggressive Growth Strategy, ETH seems like a sound investment for MakerDAO. Sebastian from Strategic Finance moves forward on the Balance Sheet Approach toward an Aggressive Growth Strategy by gauging community sentiment on whether we would like to begin working on allocating some of the MakerDAO balance sheets into ETH and/or ETH derivatives: Pros:  MakerDAO is using Ethereum as its home base and is therefore linked to the success of ETH. ETH is a strategic asset for the operations of the DAO because it pays gas fees for on-chain transactions and oracles. Competitors like Celo, TribeDAO, and Angle are holding ETH on their balance sheet, and not holding ETH puts Maker at a distinct competitive disadvantage. The upcoming Merge will significantly reduce the issuance of new ETH and create a competitive market for balance sheets with a high degree of exposure to ETH. Post-Merge staking fees are currently estimated at 7-11%, doubling current staking yields overnight and making ETH a truly productive asset.  Cons:  ETH is a volatile asset whose ETH/DAI price can wildly fluctuate and occasionally go down over significant periods The Merge and L2 impacts can have unexpected long-term impacts on price.  Sebastian also notes that this Signal Request aims to understand whether there is a community desire to work on this topic. No priority is currently being attributed, and a formal implementation for such actions will have to go through the governance processes. The vote will run until May 12th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1705\u00d7912 190 KB   Change lid Parameter on the Rate Limiter The passing and introduction of the Rate Limiting Flapper have been successful, but it only allows to kick off a new auction if the new auction does not increase the total-DAI-currently-in-auction above a certain threshold - the lid unless it\u2019s at the same value as the bump. Currently, the value for the lid is set to 150k Dai, which can run five flap auctions at once. However, ultraschuppi believes there is no good reason to burn so much MKR and proposes setting the lid to the same value as bump - 30,000 Dai. Having a 1:1 \u2018lid\u2019 to \u2018bump\u2019 ratio will ensure that there is only one parallel flap auction running at any given time. What\u2019s good about this is that in the case of a huge spike on the System Surplus causing spillage to the Surplus Buffer, the time spread of those resulting auctions will be 5x compared to the current setting, thereby producing a more steady burn. However, we will limit the maximum MKR burnt per day from 7.2MM Dai to 1.44MM Dai in sacrifice. Vote will run until May 13, 2022.

Stop-Loss Protection will ensure that a vault will close out automatically if the collateralization ratio hits a preset threshold and protect against liquidation. Setting it up has no additional cost except the gas fees for the transaction. However, it is impossible to know the gas and swap costs at the moment of the transaction. The value shown before execution is an approximate value that may slightly differ from the actual value. To learn how to set up a Stop-Loss Protection or how it works, check out their blog.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates.  Online PDF Version | Show some love to our Medium account   We have some new ideas for improvement and would appreciate your feedback to help make the Weekly Relay more enjoyable publication.     The Endgame Plan and Voter Committees  Last Thursday, MakerDAO co-founder @rune made a public presentation of the Endgame Plan, a long-term plan for MakerDAO with \u201ca fully defined, immutable steady state as its end goal.\u201d The idea involves a comprehensive overhaul of MakerDAO governance practices, narrowing the focus so that MKR holders can realistically stay up to date with important happenings in Maker governance. The plan centers around the idea of MetaDAOs, in turn, an evolution of the idea of SubDAOs or DAO Pods\u2014in essence, \u201csmaller and specialized DAOs that are connected to a main \u2018mothership DAO\u2019 (Maker in this case) through shared tokenomics, incentives and/or infrastructure.\u201d @rune argues that MetaDAOs can help us solve most or all of the problems MakerDAO is currently being confronted with, as well as helping us make the best decisions in cases where trade-offs are unavoidable. Discussion of @rune\u2019s latest series of calls and ideas is ongoing in The MKR holder Confessional. The MKR Holder Voter Committee Public Call is available every Tuesday at 3 PM UTC  Join Link  Real World Finance: Decision-Making and Delegated Committee Proposal @christiancdpetersen of the Real World Finance Core Unit made a post outlining a proposal for a decision-making methodology for Real-World Assets (RWAs) after they have already been onboarded as collateral. In a nutshell, the proposal involves delegating a slice of decision-making to a committee of volunteers approved by MKR token holders. This proposal\u2019s primary motivation is that RWAs require a wider range of decision-making than crypto-native assets.  Maker needs a methodology for managing onboarded RWA collateral that is:  Transparent Practical Commercially reasonable Responsive to MKR token holders  In the TradFi world, \u201chigh-impact\u201d decisions are referred to as \u201cLender\u2019s Sacred Rights.\u201d In the context of MakerDAO, we can view these rights as follows:  Once these rights are well defined, other, lower-impact decisions can be delegated to an independent third-party committee of volunteers.  The Real World Finance Core Unit proposes establishing an independent Committee of Delegated Maker Representatives to handle decision-making for issues not included in the high-impact \u201csacred rights\u201d category.  Some initial ideas for criteria potential volunteers should satisfy include:  Traditional finance experience (commercial, legal, executive, risk, etc.) and/or experience with the particular asset class at hand Willingness to be a decision-maker on matters delegated to the Committee Willingness to review and make decisions on complex issues quickly, given commercial timelines Willingness to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement with the borrower, as the delegate may have access to confidential, non-public information Willingness to represent the Maker community No economic interest in the proposed borrower or the proposed asset (subject to standard carve-outs for non-material ownership interests in public companies) No economic interest in an existing borrower or an asset already onboarded into Maker  If interested, contact @eumenes or @christiancdpetersen on the forums. Governance Stats and Tracker Dashboard  761\u00d7215 10.1 KB  GovAlpha has introduced v1 of its Governance Dashboard, providing visualization tools for important stats and metrics related to governance and delegation.  Some of the data available includes:  MKR delegated and delegator count for all recognized and shadow delegates, as well as total amounts for all delegates Total and individual amount of MKR staked and delegated Current and historical vote weights for delegates Number of poll voters per month   The Tracker section includes GovAlpha\u2019s Governance Tracker, together with extra functionality, such as custom filters for active proposals, high-impact proposals, and proposals ending this week. [Postponed] Focus On #12: Centrifuge Indenture Trust Agreement Deep Dive The 12th episode of Focus On, originally scheduled for May 21st, has been postponed due to illness. If you\u2019re interested in a joint discussion by Centrifuge and the Legal & Transaction Services Core Unit (currently under incubation) to discuss the development of Centrifuge\u2019s legal structure, keep an eye on the forums for an announcement about the new date. General Counsel of Centrifuge Eli Cohen (@elidco) and Legal & Transaction Services Core Unit member Christian Petersen (@christiancdpetersen) will explore:  The goal of the agreement How the agreement works in practice How the structure will scale real-world assets for both Centrifuge and MakerDAO      Executive Vote Foundational L2 Work, Authorize New Flash Mint Module, MKR Vesting - May 18, 2022 This executive proposal passed, and the following changes occurred within the Maker Protocol:  Core Unit MKR Vesting Transfer As per their successful MKR budget proposal, a total of 541.47 MKR was transferred to the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit (SES-001).  Foundational L2 Work The Maker Teleport initiative, previously known as Maker Wormhole, will be bringing canonical DAI capability onto L2 domains. As part of this development and to support L2->L1 fast-withdrawal functionality, it is necessary to introduce a new module called DssCure and update the existing MCD_END module to interact with it.  A new DssCure module was added to the Maker Protocol as MCD_CURE in the chainlog. The MCD_END module was replaced by a new version that interacts with MCD_CURE. The existing ESM contract MCD_ESM was made to point to the new MCD_END.  For more details, please read this forum post by the Protocol Engineering Core Unit (PE-001).  New Flash Mint Module  As described in this forum post, the following changes occurred:  A new Flash Mint Module was deployed and authorized. The new module has no fee parameter and charges no fee to save on gas. The Debt Ceiling was set to 250M on the new module and reduced to 250M on the existing module to maintain 500M total. Both modules are available in the chainlog as MCD_FLASH_LEGACY and MCD_FLASH. The intention is to remove the MCD_FLASH_LEGACY contract in a future executive proposal once usage has shifted to the new version.

Active Signal Requests Do you believe Signal Requests are valuable in the Weekly Relay? Should we omit them and keep them only in the Forum at a Glance? We are discussing trimming any redundancies and low-value sections from the GovComm publications; let us know if you have any ideas, opinions, or feedback. Thanks! Request Return of MKR Tokens Inadvertently Sent to Governance Address wingstick_99942 inadvertently sent 3.1994 MKR to the MKR Governance Address and submitted a signal request in hopes of a way to return that MKR to the sender\u2019s address. Several Core Unit members and Recognized Delegates stated the unfortunate reality that it is impossible to return MKR from the Governance Address because nobody has keys or control over that address. The vote will run until May 30th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1675\u00d7737 103 KB   Offboard UNI, UNIV2DAIETH, UNIV2WBTCETH, UNIV2UNIETH, and UNIV2WBTCDAI This signal request was prepared by the CMON (Collateral Management On-chain) initiative and its stakeholders, including different CES-led core units. Due to lack, they propose to offboard UNI-A, UNIV2DAIETH-A, UNIV2WBTCETH-A, UNIV2UNIETH-A, and UNIV2WBTCDAI-A of demand and consequent negative cash flow. The main problem with these vault types is pure lack of demand as the underlying assets (ETH, WBTC, and UNI) have relatively high on-chain liquidity. MOMC attempted to make them more attractive by lowering the SF at the end of January, but demand, unfortunately, didn\u2019t increase. Proposed parameters were set in a way where we try to minimize the damage done to existing vault owners while ensuring that sufficient amounts of debt will either be repaid or, less desirable, liquidated with minimal costs for the vault owners. Proposed parameter changes;  Set liquidation penalty to 0% Set debt ceiling to 0 Set tip to 0 Set duration of dss-lerp for liquidation ratio to 30 days Set the end parameter of dss-lerp for liquidation ratio for each vault type as the following; highest collateral ratio vault within each vault type multiplied by 3, rounded on hundred.  The vote will run until May 26th, 2022 Outcomes will either result in on-chain polls assuming the outcomes are yes, or will be reinitiated with different parameters and/or strategies.

Online PDF Version | Show some love to our Medium account   We have some new ideas for improvement and would appreciate your feedback to help make the Weekly Relay a more enjoyable publication.     Decentralized Voter Committee Citing the decentralization risk inherent in any large system such as a DAO that falls prey to a \u201ccomplexity spiral\u201d\u2014in which it becomes increasingly difficult for anyone but a full-time professional DAO member to develop and maintain a complete understanding of the inner workings of the DAO and how decisions are made\u2014MakerDAO co-founder @rune has shared his Endgame Plan strategy, which aims to:  Establish principles that enshrine radical decentralization and transparency as fundamental pillars for how governance works Create a bounded, immutable scope of Maker Governance it cannot expand beyond to prevent organic complexity growth  The first step of the Endgame Plan is to establish Decentralized Voter Committees, in which MKR holders are provided a \u201csafe space\u201d to air their concerns, discuss their interests, and coordinate on votes. These committees will take the form of transparent, recorded conference calls available both to members of the DAO and to the general public. The first Decentralized Voter Committee took place on Tuesday, May 17th, at 5 pm CEST (3 pm UTC). The video recording will soon be available along with a semi-transcription summary. The first Decentralized Voter Committee was designed to serve as \u201ca bit of a test run\u201d and will likely focus on bringing in larger MKR holders, who \u201chave more skin in the game and a larger sway on votes.\u201d A thread for discussing potential topics and ideas for the first meeting is available here.

Active Signal Requests Request Return of MKR Tokens Inadvertently Sent to Governance Address wingstick_99942 inadvertently sent 3.1994 MKR to the MKR Governance Address and submitted a signal request in hopes of a way to return that MKR to the sender\u2019s address. Several Core Unit members and Recognized Delegates stated the unfortunate reality that it is impossible to return MKR from the Governance Address because nobody has keys or control over that address. The vote will run until May 30th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1692\u00d7692 88.8 KB   Offboard UNI, UNIV2DAIETH, UNIV2WBTCETH, UNIV2UNIETH, and UNIV2WBTCDAI This signal request was prepared by the CMON (Collateral Management On-chain) initiative and its stakeholders, including different Core Units led by CES. Due to lack, they propose to offboard UNI-A, UNIV2DAIETH-A, UNIV2WBTCETH-A, UNIV2UNIETH-A, and UNIV2WBTCDAI-A of demand and consequent negative cash flow. The main problem with these vault types is pure lack of demand as the underlying assets (ETH, WBTC, and UNI) have relatively high on-chain liquidity. MOMC attempted to make them more attractive by lowering the SF at the end of January, but demand, unfortunately, didn\u2019t increase. Proposed parameters were set in a way where we try to minimize the damage done to existing vault owners while ensuring that sufficient amounts of debt will either be repaid or, less desirable, liquidated with minimal costs for the vault owners. Proposed parameter changes;  Set liquidation penalty to 0% Set debt ceiling to 0 Set tip to 0 Set duration of dss-lerp for liquidation ratio to 30 days Set the end parameter of dss-lerp for liquidation ratio for each vault type as the following; highest collateral ratio vault within each vault type multiplied by 3, rounded on hundred.  The vote will run until May 26th, 2022 Outcomes will either result in on-chain polls assuming the outcomes are yes, or will be reinitiated with different parameters and/or strategies.

Teleport will burn Dai on the origin chain and mint it on the destination chain without any need for a centralized party.  With these features in place, Maker Teleport is expected to be faster and more secure than an existing competitor; even with a one basis point fee, Teleport is estimated to remain 75-99% cheaper than competing protocols. While one basis point may seem low, the Strategic Finance Core Unit believes that Teleport will experience strong growth, leading to significant revenues for Maker.

BaconCoin is a stablecoin backed by US mortgages. Potential benefits include:  A single onboarding procedure that can scale both the amount of capital used and the number of home loans over time Broad distribution of Dai to homeowners in the US Higher risk-adjusted yields across a diversified set of home loans Maker selects the underwriting criteria to use, allowing for investing in loans that are highly aligned with Maker\u2019s vision of funding sustainability initiatives Bacon will develop and maintain the D3M integration in line with the CES enablement strategy Governance has direct control over the Dai supply added to Bacon through the Debt Ceiling  @abdalla lists smart contract risk as a potential con but also offers two ideas for mitigating risks:  Whitelisting addresses with deposit functionality can reduce exploit risk (Maker would be the only liquidity provider) Credit risk assessment of borrowers can be performed by loan originators using the industry-standard FICO score  The vote will run until May 19th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1695\u00d7685 112 KB   Increase the ESM Minimum Threshold GovAlpha submitted a Signal Request to gauge support for increasing the minimum threshold to trigger the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) from 100,000 MKR to 150,000 MKR. GovAlpha recommends this adjustment to minimize the threat of a hostile emergency shutdown occurring. With the recent fall in the MKR price, triggering an emergency shutdown has become significantly cheaper based on the current minimum threshold. The goal is to find the right balance between making it very expensive for a bad actor to acquire or borrow enough MKR to trigger an emergency shutdown without making it overly difficult for a legitimate emergency shutdown to be triggered if necessary (for example, in response to the discovery of a critical bug in the Maker Protocol or the prevention of a malicious governance attack). The vote will run until May 20th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1700\u00d7702 110 KB   Antalpha Institutional Vault @William_Chiu has compiled recent discussions between the Growth, Risk, and Protocol Engineering Core Unites and Antalpha to propose a new institutional vault. The post outlines both the goals of the proposal and the mechanisms for achieving them. Goals  Boosting DAI Supply Generating greater revenue for MakerDAO and our partners Enhancing capital efficiency for our partners Longer-term borrowing commitment with a level of borrowing rate-predictability  Mechanisms  Boosting DAI Supply Generating greater revenue for MakerDAO and our partners Enhancing capital efficiency for our partners Longer-term borrowing commitment with a level of borrowing rate-predictability-   Origination fee: will be applied to all DAI at the time of minting. This is not restricted and is open to change via Governance (specifically the Parameter Changes Proposal group). Meaning that any partner will have a lead time of 2-3 weeks before any changes are implemented. Stability fee: is determined upfront and fixed for a period of time. This fixed rate can be reduced as additional collateral is added. Vault starting size: to ensure that such vaults will mint a minimum amount of DAI to gain favorable rates. Antalpha intends to utilize a DAI loan to strengthen the stable coin portion of the balance sheet to support one of its primary lending and borrowing businesses. Antalpha will take on collateral at a higher level than the level borrowing from DAI to implement proper credit risk management and utilize systems and algorithmic trading to facilitate managing the loans and collateral.  Proposed Terms     Institutional Vault Type Permissioned ETH and wBTC Vaults (INST-WBTC-5, INST-ETH-5)     Qualifying Vault size: 200MM   Debt Ceiling 1B, 500MM for ETH, and 500MM for wBTC   Origination fee: 1% of DAI minted   Origination fee behavior: Origination fee is not restricted and can be changed through Governance via a Parameter Changes Proposal. Antalpha has a 2-3 week lead-time to any Origination fee rate change.   Origination fee future commitments Maker and Antalpha will work together to propose reductions to the origination fee if the vault size grows significantly.   Stability fee: WBTC-A stability fee1 - 50bps & ETH-A stability fee2 - 50bps   Stability fee3 behavior: Fixed for six months. After the 200m DAI minted, an additional 100m DAI minted will reduce the stability fee by ten basis points (per vault) to a minimum of Stability fee-30bps for six months. The stability fee reduction will be manual via an executive vote. After six months, open community dialogue facilitated by the Growth CU will determine ongoing stability fees.   Collateral Ratio: 150%   Collateral Ratio Behavior: Failure to maintain 200% CR4 over the majority of seven days will increase the SF to 5% and the LR to 150%. The seven days would be calculated by ensuring that 95% of the OSM updates show that the CR is equal to or greater than 200%.   Liquidation Ratio: 120%     Here are the current voting results:  1690\u00d7690 116 KB   The vote will run until May 19th, 2022    Last Week\u2019s Call Recordings:  Governance & Risk: Episode 190 | Video | Forum  Collateral Onboarding Call #43 | Fei & Rari Pools Use Cases   video | Forum    Collateral Onboarding Call #42 | Monetalis MIP65 & MIP68 AMA   video | Forum     Upcoming Calls:  Meet Your Delegate #12 - London Business School (LBS)   Forum | Join Link 2022-05-25T18:30:00Z     Governance & Risk Call:   Join Link | Agenda - Thursdays at 17:00 UTC  Core Unit Office Hours   Join Link | GovAlpha Governance Q&As - Mondays 17:00 UTC  Join Link | Immunefi Security - Tuesdays 00:00 UTC  Join Link | Protocol Engineering - Tuesdays 15:00 UTC  Join Link | Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling - Tuesdays 15:30 UTC  Join Link | Growth - Wednesdays 17:00 UTC  Join Link | Real World Finance - Wednesdays 17:00 UTC  Join Link | Governance Communications - Fridays 18:00 UTC     Useful Links Open Forum and Maker Chat Discuss and debate MakerDAO.
