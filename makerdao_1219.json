                    "content": "We\u2019ve had a couple of good threads discussing what the authors feel are systemic risks to the Dai Credit System. In addition there have been a few more risks discussed off-forum or on the now deprecated mkrgov subreddit. This topic is meant to collate these risks and to provide a place for the community to signal its informed opinion of the severity of these risks so that the community can consider the wisdom of possible fixes or mitigations. Note the emphasis on informed, please do take part, but take the time to inform yourself on what you\u2019re voting on first.  The scale used is open to debate, but I suggest a 1-10 scale where: 1 = I am happy to live with this risk forever. 10 = I believe we will have to Emergency Shutdown due to this risk in the near future.  Flat-rate increases across multiple loan types due to exogenous reasons has unequal impact on the market competitiveness of collateral-packages. Detailed here.    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10    0 voters      Under the proposed system and policy, there is no adequate tool for combating high demand for a specific collateral package without effecting the rest of the system. Detailed here.    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10    0 voters      Scaling through additional collateral types will not come quickly enough to prevent organic Dai demand from overtaking Dai supply which could result in the Dai peg breaking. Detailed here.    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10    0 voters     I would encourage anyone that has identified possible risks in the system to write them up in a forum post. Once they have been discussed, they should be added here for signalling and visibility. ",

Several other systemic risks have been discussed over the last few months, it would be great if someone wanted to create/link discussion threads and create entries on this list. The MKR governance attack issue is one that would be good to add, although I\u2019m not sure if there has been a forum post that describes the attack from a neutral and balanced perspective. I would also encourage engaged members of the community to read through the currently listed risks and help us to judge their severity. I\u2019m also going to pin this to the risk category, if it ends up being used great, if not I\u2019ll probably unpin it in a month or so (or if something comes up to replace it.) ",

We are able to set different SF values for different collateral types (and also different collateralization ratios) while having one fixed DSR so we can mitigate differences in demand. Actually required collateralization ratio on its own looks like perfect tool to mitigate both risks ",
