I am currently conducting research to be used for a book in which a substantial section is dedicated to MakerDAO. To do so, I am mapping the token flows within the MakerDAO system and am in need of  information on some of these flows. Furthermore, a stakeholder map will be drawn. There are numerous questions that need answering to produce a comprehensive dive into MakerDAO. These questions range from initial MKR distribution, to the specificities of Keepers, and their, as well as other stakeholder\u2019s incentivization. I would much appreciate if someone within MakerDAO could reach out to me to set up a line of communication, or if a community member could guide me to the correct places to ask my specific questions. Thank you all  ",

Unfortunately, the answers to the questions surrounding these models and research in general cannot be found within the Technical or other documentation, or have conflicting documentation (both within and outside of official MakerDAO docs). This research will be published in a book, and so it is imperative nothing is left to assumption. ",

Good luck with the research and definitely make sure to leverage the community for any specific questions\u2014the state of documentation at MakerDAO is a bit of a mess at this point\u2026 Also note that we have a #research channel in the MakerDAO Discord, so I highly suggest you join there as well.
