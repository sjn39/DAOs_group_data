Many of the public good projects that Gitcoin funds would benefit from having something similar for their own community. I propose setting up something along the lines of a 1Hive Garden as an option for projects that are ready and suitable to run their own token market. I believe this will encourage more projects to be self-sustaining more quickly. ",
