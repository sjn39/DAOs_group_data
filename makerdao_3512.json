I would like this thread to be a place to both brainstorm specific ideas and draw attention to a potential revenue source from our existing and future oracle network. I think it deserves attention and as someone not involved in its operation, would like to learn more about its capabilities and potential. My first thoughts are that our feeds \u2014 both Medianizer and OSM \u2014 could be either sold as a subscription or bundled with private vaults (to KYC and collect more market data) in the following ways:   Near real-time data across markets to enable/prevent arbitrage   Added risk management by exchanges/brokers that wish to be alerted to possible market manipulation in their specific pools (waves to Compound)   Collection of historical data for algorithmic and other technical trading desks to backtest strategies   Better information for news sources that currently all seem to draw 24-hour VWAP feeds instead of ours   Ability for market participants to see the true depth and liquidity of individual assets across the fragmented crypto exchange ecosystem   \u2026and so forth and so forth. So. What resources does the oracle team need to retain historic data and how can we make a product that growth can pitch? ",

Is this because we\u2019ve been mostly internally focused, is the market just unaware, or are they different businesses? I don\u2019t really know anything about the oracle business outside of the LINK marines trying to shill everyone under the sun about their partnerships so appreciate any insight. Very much looking forward to the CU proposal! ",
