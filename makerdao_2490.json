The alternative is that these other protocols, including potential issuers of a Dai-like token, will outcompete Maker because depositors and borrowers are better off using other protocols. If MKR holders decide they do not want to see the peg drift up to $1.10 as deposits leave Maker for Compound, Aave and other protocols, they can start issuing MKR tokens to depositors. The downside is MKR won\u2019t be deflationary. The upside is MKR tokens will accrue tremendous price increases anyway. ",

Consider the following: COMP offers a supply rate of 1.7% on USDC right now.  If MakerDao had a PSM that traded Dai for USDC at some price over $1.00  MakerDao would profit immediately from the trade, reduce the price of Dai in the process, and could then loan the USDC out to people for 1% or any percent lower than COMP.  MakerDao profits again from the interest, increases the Dai supply, and at the same time because those people are going to take the USDC they get as a loan over to COMP to \u201cfarm\u201d this will increase the supply of USDC over at COMP which will make their rates less attractive. My point is MakerDao is doing things right and these places like COMP are doing them wrong.  We don\u2019t need to emulate poor behavior.  MakerDao should make prudent sustainable choices and simply take advantage of COMP and AAVE making these short sighted mistakes they are making currently. ",

As they do this, it destroys Dai and increases the price of Dai. At some point Maker will be forced into global settlement.

MakerDao can loan cheaper than these other systems and then if they want to further subsidize MakerDao loans more power to them throwing money out the window while MakerDao profits and they continuously hemorrhage money (or Dao equity in this case). Eventually the profit from these loans could even be used to circle back into paying vault holders to generate Dai like you are saying. Let\u2019s look at ETH as an example:  You can take ETH to COMP and get .3% for it in interest as a deposit.  OR you can take it to MakerDao and borrow Dai for 0% then take the Dai to COMP and loan that out for 2.5% interest.  Which is better? ",

As a result most people are borrowing with leverage and the rates are variable on the loan.  Not only that, the payment you are using is in COMP which can also change value at any time.  This is a recipe for disaster for borrowers over there.  What do you want me to address?  I have already stated it is unsustainable. Hopefully those loans unwind easily I am not too familiar with how that goes over there, but I can tell you that even if you believe that what COMP is doing does indeed work and will last\u2026 (which it won\u2019t).  That even if it could, it would still make sense to borrow from MakerDao first and take what you have borrowed to COMP to get the subsidies in pretty much every asset MakerDao decides to give loans in.  (right now that is only DAI). COMP borrowing is essentially a ponzi scheme is what I am saying.  Just be sure to get out before everyone else or you are going to have a bad time. ",
