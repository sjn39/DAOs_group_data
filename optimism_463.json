Growth Experiments Grant category: NFT Project description: Oppa Bear NFT community creates the ecosystem itself into a number of ways e.g. Staking & Rewards platform, Merch Store platform, Augmented Reality (AR), Art Toy, Game Card, etc. We aim to create in-real-life (IRL) business and put into Oppa Bear community\u2019s benefits. We have two main collections: \u201cOppa Bear Pixel\u201d and \u201cOppa Bear Evolution\u201d. \u201cOppa Bear Pixel\u201d is the NFT project focusing on linking up the community with the real-world businesses. It is a 1,000 Generative utility NFT with back-up assets. We also have another collection called \u201cOppa Bear Evolution Gen.1\u201d(1,500 NFTs), which can be transformed into Oppa Bear Evolution Gen.2 from Growth Serums and turning into Mutant Oppa Bear. This is to make it more fun for our holders to participate in the project activities. Both Oppa Bear Pixel and Oppa Bear Evolution are linked together under Optimism.

Yes Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: July 30th, 2022 Ecosystem Value Proposition: We have a fantastic community ever on the Optimism NFT community. Our main focus is to develop IRL businesses into the Oppa Bear community. We aim to link with the real-world usage of goods and products under four pillars:  First, Oppa Bear NFT is partnered with many other NFTs in Optimism and other platforms e.g. Apetimism (Optimism), BitToon DAO and BullMoon Club (Ethereum), Stocker DAO (Bitkub Chain) etc. We\u2019ve created the NFT fusion between Oppa Bear NFT and other NFTs to be used for some benefits. For example, the holders who hold both partnership collection will get NFT airdrop e.g. Oppa BApetimism, Oppa Toon, Oppa Bull, Oppa Stock and Oppa Neard, etc. This is to link our Oppa Bear Community and other communities closer and closer. We also invited and were invited to participate into the real-life event e.g. Super Car Racing, Dining activities, Karaoke events, and meeting up events between communities.  Second, Oppa Bear NFT aims to be the utility NFT to be beneficial to Oppa Bear holders. We\u2019ve partnered with many businesses. For example, Oppa Bear holders are able to show up their Oppa Bear NFT to get 10% discount at Mandarin EastVille Pattaya (Hotel business), 10% discount at SoEra Aesthetic Wellness Clinic (High-end clinic and spa), 15% discount when ordering DTF Screened Shirt/T-shirt/Hoodie, 10% discount at Symmetry Bangkok Coffee Shop, etc. By linking our Oppa bear community with the strategic partnership will help improving engagement and drive growth of Optimism ecosystem.  Third, Oppa Bear NFT is now linked with back-up asset brand ETACHA. ETACHA sold over 10 Million bags in the past two years and now partnering with Oppa Bear! We created a number of design and put our Oppa Bear NFT into their bags for launching new collection and sell throughout offline eight department stores in Bangkok and online stores too. Oppa Bear community will also get 10% of Royalty fee from the sale of ETACHA and 100% belong to the community. We will add more partners in the near future.  Fourth, Oppa Bear NFT also aims to have generated revenue itself to Oppa Bear community. Hence, we started to create Oppa Bear Studio to capture the souvenir gifts in special events e.g. Valentine\u2019s day gift, Birthday gift, Wedding ceremony, or even Augmented Reality (AR) Marriage proposal. We believe this would help generating revenue into our community. Please see more details of example in the link here. We also created the Merch Store to sell products such as Shirt, Hoodie, Cap, Trousers, etc. All profit will belong to the community.   All of these four main pillars are the philosophy of Oppa Bear community, which leads to \u201cSustainability\u201d in the long-term goal. As we have Optimism to support for OP Granting Fund for back-up funding, this would help a number of ways in driving the strong interest in Oppa Bear NFT and community. Number of OP tokens requested: 30,000 $OP (we believe this amount would be far enough in maintaining and driving activities in our community as we have very lean operating expense). We now spend only about $500 a month in driving all community activity and events, including staking & rewards pool to be exchanged for staking OPB token. Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No Proposal for token distribution: 50% \u2013 Staking Pool We\u2019ve created the staking & rewards pool for our Oppa Bear Holders to enjoy profit of OPB Token, which can be exchanged to our rewards. Please see link here: https://www.oppabear-nft.com  Once the holders buy NFTs, the NFTs will be locked for 15 days in our smart contract pool and can claim rewards, OPB Token, anytime. The OPB Token can be used to purchase T-Shirt, Cap, Cup, NFTs. This is to keep our OPB ecosystem and attract new potential holders into our pool. If we are granted for $OP rewards, this will be a big news to our community as we can turn OPB Token into $OP simultaneously. This would be more attractive to our holders and make them happy. 30% \u2013 Reward Pool Our holders will be able to get the Reward Pool from: OPPA BEAR STAKING AND REWARD. We will also need to make some product for inventory in our reward pool if we want the price to be lower from suppliers. Currently, we are able to send delivery only in the country (Thailand), but if we receive this funding, we are able to send worldwide; so we can have more participants and holders. 20% \u2013 Development & Marketing Expense We are aware of spending money in our pocket as it belongs to the Oppa Bear community. However, there are a number of expenses relating to the investment in development such as staking & reward pools, Fusion website (from Gen.1 to Gen.2 and Gen.2 to Mutant Oppa Bear), Merch Store development, Website maintenance, etc. If we are granted for the $OP Funding, this would help us in maintaining activities in our community to be more active.

The main issue I see here with a builders grant proposal like this is that the team did not take the time to understand that there is a token lock for 12 months and that they are not able to use the tokens right away. The staking and reward pools that are mentioned in the grant or something that would fall more into the category of growth experiments. I do not believe that funds are available for things such as creating a merchandise store because that would be something that is not Blockchain related first off if they are accepting payments in fiat and second not an appropriate usage of the funds if they are being used for development as well as something that would be applied for through a foundation or growth experiment grant. Especially if the project is looking for development funding, website maintenance, and marketing. Some extra guidance may be needed for smaller NFT projects within the ecosystem to re-apply in cycle 11 if there is a bit of a miscommunication or understanding on how to submit. As well as an AMA coming up on the 3rd from OP Gov about this. ",

While we ourselves are open to this policy changing, it is the current policy and will not be changing for this grants cycle. Currently 20% of the distribution is earmarked for development and marketing expense, which would appear to violate the no sale rule. 2. There do not appear to be clear milestones to track the progress of this grant. Please include some measurable milestones in the grant plan. Thank you, and feel free to reach out to ourselves or the Grants Council lead with questions about the process. ",
