(Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Growth Experiment Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): Giveth is incredibly aligned with Optimism in using web3 to evolve our coordination around Public Goods! Our community is focused on Building the Future of Giving using blockchain technology. Our intention is to support and reward the funding of public goods by creating open, transparent and free access to the revolutionary funding opportunities available within the Ethereum ecosystem.We would like to add our Donation Application (https://giveth.io) to the Optimism chain so that every project on Giveth can raise funds with Optimism. On our DApp, 100% of donations go directly to the project and Donors to verified projects are rewarded with GIVbacks. Making a project to raise funds with Giveth is simple and permissionless, however to be part of the GIVbacks program and reward your donors with GIV, projects have to submit an application for our verification team to review to ensure they are truly a Public Goods project.The GIVeconomy is what really sets us apart from just being another donation application, below is a quick run-through of the major pieces of our ecosystem.GIV - A transferable ERC-20 token that lies at the heart of the future of giving (native to Mainnet). (LAUNCHED)GIVbacks - The entry point to the GIVeconomy. Donors to verified public goods projects, get GIV tokens in return. This flips the script on tax deductible donation, creating a decentralized and borderless way of incentivizing donations. (LAUNCHED)GIVgarden - Giveth\u2019s token holder DAO. GIV token holders are able to propose and vote on how to use the Giveth community treasury using Conviction Voting. (LAUNCHED)nrGIV DAO - The equivalent of other economy\u2019s foundation, this is a unique reputation DAO, any contributor who has been actively participating in our community for over 3 months can join. This DAO mostly handles the day-to-day operations and stewards the GIVeconomy smart contracts. (LAUNCHED)GIVpower - Donors can lock their GIV tokens for GIVpower and use them to boost/curate projects and public goods on the platform. Projects with more GIVpower are ranked higher and in turn, reward their donors with more GIVbacks. Locking is live, boosting is fully developed and being tested now, it should roll out in an upcoming release (LAUNCHED)GIVfi - Latent donations on the platform can be used to generate a low-risk yield while waiting to be disbursed. This yield is split between buying GIV tokens on the open market and the projects themselves (via GIVsavings), enabling nonprofits to have a defi saving account . (PHASED ROLL OUT - 2023)GURVES - The holy grail of public goods funding. Giveth projects can evolve into DAOs with their own micro-economy collateralized by GIV in a Bonding Curve. This is still very much in the research phase in partnership with Commons Stack, but is the Giveth endgame, turning the donation platform into an investment platform. (TBA)We also intend to integrate NFT fundraising, Quadratic Funding in partnership with Gitcoin as well as several other integrations, partnerships, and community projects in the pipeline.

Is/will this project be open sourced?: Yes Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 4/5/2023 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?: Optimism is sorely missing a donation platform. If someone wants to donate some of their profits to a for-good project, they must bridge to mainnet first. Giveth wants to change that!Not only can Giveth bring hundreds of already verified Public Goods projects to the Optimism network, we can also integrate and enhance the retroPGF system.We can enable projects on Giveth to raise funds on Optimism and any donation to verified projects on Optimism would get up to 75% of their donation back in GIV tokens through our GIVbacks program.GIVbacks is a Public Goods lego that could plug in nicely to the Retroactive Public Goods Funding program. Any funding to a verified project would receive GIVbacks. For example if a project (outside of the Optimism team) is providing an alternate RPC, they could qualify as a verified project and donations to support them would be eligible for GIVbacks.Learn more about GIVbacks here: What if giving gave back? Using web3 to evolve philanthropy. | by Lauren | Giveth | MediumGiveth enables anyone working to produce public goods to raise funds with crypto, hopefully soon that will also be with funds on Optimism!But this is just the beginning. Giveth hopes to help projects evolve past donations and sacrifice. Public goods are not just a feel-good, heartwarming act of kindness. They are a $25 Trillion global industry, and in our opinion the most overlooked web3 opportunity. We have the opportunity to disrupt this sector with web3 tooling & Giveth is positioned to lead the way. Check out this awesome video from Devcon with Griff describing this opportunity at length, while also giving a shout out to OP and RPGF. (The Biggest Web3 Opportunity No One is Talking About! by Griff Green | Devcon Bogot\u00e1 - YouTube)Crypto donations is witnessing incredible growth. The total annual volume of crypto donations grew by 1,558% or more than 16x from 2020 to 2021. Source: theGivingBlock. Giveth can bring this growth to Optimism. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: We would like bring the donation culture in as many chains as possible. But we believe Optimism is a great start for this project. Giveth can bring hundreds of already verified Public Goods projects to the Optimism network.We can enable projects on Giveth to raise funds on Optimism and any donation to verified projects on Optimism would get up to 80% of their donation back in GIV tokens through our GIVbacks program. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: We would like to add Optimism to our DApp so all our projects can collect donations on Optimism. We would incentivize donations made on Giveth using Optimism with our own tokenWe will measure the success of this project by number of projects onboarded on Optimism and creating a bigger demand for Optimism which is measured and produced during our weekly DAO calls as well as on our dashboards. So far we have more than 1,700 projects registered on Giveth, over 14,500 donations with + 4,200 unique donors who are actively contributing on our platform. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: Not really, we were part of the first retroactive public goods funding round before Optimism launched but haven\u2019t applied for a grant since the token was created. Number of OP tokens requested: 230,000 OP for this grant Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: 0 How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): 100% of the incentives will come from our token, we will incentivize donors to donate on OP with GIV tokens and not use OP tokens for incentives. Instead we will make a liquidity pool with the OP and GIV. How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): Our GIVbacks program is incredible, it is the web3 replacement for tax deductible donations. No tax rebates, no government involvement at all. Instead, when people donate to verified projects on Giveth, they get up to 80% of their donation back in GIV tokens.The intention is to create a win-win partnership where both projects get the benefit of extra liquidity on Mainnet, and we do not have to sell any OP. If people prefer OP rewards to GIV rewards, they can trade the GIV for OP.Assuming prices stay stable, this distribution approach would create demand and deeper liquidity for OP instead of sell pressure as is the norm with these proposals. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: Primarily we\u2019d like to ask for: 200K $OP to create an LP against GIV to allow GIV to have a secondary market on Optimism. 20k $OP would be rewarded to the first 400 verified public good projects on Giveth that add an $OP 10k $OP will be allocated for the development work (2 months) for this project based on the technical roadmap outlined below.To allow GIV to be given to donors on optimism, we would need to have a liquid market on Optimism, otherwise we would be driving people off the chain. This is why we\u2019d want to create a sizable LP with Optimism. This OP will not be sold, it will simply be held in an LP for perpetuity. We would be very happy to hold it in a multisig with other members of the optimism community so that Giveth doesn\u2019t have control over it. Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: technical milestones with funding split + LP request is outlined in detail in this document:   docs.google.com    Giveth x Optimism Milestones Milestones Onboard Objective for this funding: Primarily we\u2019d like to ask for 400K Optimism to create an LP against GIV to allow GIV to have a secondary market on Optimism. 20k USD out of this grant would be distributed to support part of the...      Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: With the LP solution, the incentives will not dry up. Our GIVbacks program has GIV tokens allocated to it until Dec 2026 and we assume it will be extended\u2026 Even better, when people donate and get GIVbacks, they get a portion as liquid GIV and the rest is streamed to them for the next 4 years. This will mean that for 4 years, these public goods supporters will have to switch their network to Optimism to collect their GIV, which will be streamed to them every minute of every day. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): NA Confirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here): I have read the Eligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions ",

None of this is going to Giveth. 200k $OP is effectively a Token Swap, the 20k $OP is funding nonprofits on Optimism.

The $OP is used to give $GIV liquidity so people do not have to leave Optimism to cash out. 87% of the $OP is going to be held in a liquidity pool, and will not be sold by our team, nor given out to anyone as rewards. On top of this, we are giving our $GIV as a reward to donors, altruistic people who are supporting public and are less likely to cash out to take profits than the traditional liquidity mining audience, who\u2019s goals are to increase the money in their bank account.

We will reward donations on Optimism to verified projects and we will launch an incentivized staking and locking system called GIVpower. Both of these systems will be rewarded in GIV, streamed over time on Optimism, which will bring users back to the Optimism chain again and again to claim their rewards until the GIVstream ends on December 23rd, 2026. Why do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?: We have been around since 2016 and aren\u2019t going anywhere. Our current version of the donation application rewards donors in a similar way as tax deductions, but without the borders or bureaucracy. Donors are rewarded when they donate to any verified project anywhere in the world. They aren\u2019t rewarded with paperwork though, they are rewarded with $GIV. This is a web3 improvement on the subsidy model for nonprofits that has been used around the world with great success. $GIV\u2019s token model is very similar to veCRV, except the locked tokens determine the donation mining rewards instead of liquidity mining rewards. Regen instead of Degen. But our mission is much larger than the current state of the GIVeconomy. Our goal is to enable nonprofits to create their own economies that can reward them for their work. We believe nonprofits create value, and that economies can be created around that value. If this theory is true, we will succeed, as we are further along this path than anyone else. Our very close partner, Commons Stack, helped deploy a nonprofit microeconomy called the Token Engineering Commons, which has only donated to projects supporting the Token Engineering space. It has had no other token utility other than governance over it\u2019s small pot of funds and yet their token price has actually beat the price of ether! When the TEC was launched in 2021, ether was $3300 and TEC was $1. As of time of writing, nearly 2 years later, ether is down ~50% and TEC is only down ~30%. This is very encouraging. Commons Stack has learned a lot from the TEC and has improved the design pattern and is now partnering with ReFi DAO to continue this applied research by deploying many more of these microeconomics. This research will end up being used to build a path for projects on Giveth to follow so they can also launch their own microeconomies. This long term vision is well outlined here: Evolving Nonprofits into Regen Economies | by Griff Green | Giveth | Feb, 2023 | Medium How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate: Since 2021 on our current iteration of the Giveth DApp (excluding the previsions iterations) we have had more than 2,300 projects created, and over 1,400 of those have been verified by our team to be legitimate public goods projects. We have had over 15,000 donations (obtained from our development team) from 4,500 unique donors for over $1.6 mil. This data can be obtained here: https://analytics-dashboard-blue.vercel.app/ How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism: With this grant we will build out the Giveth ecosystem on Optimism. There are no donation platforms on Optimism as far as I know. This use case is completely missing, and for a project focused around public goods, we believe there will be a lot of users willing to donate, more on average than most chains. Giveth\u2019s system will lock them into the Optimism ecosystem for the next several years. We will:   Enable projects to collect donations on Optimism.   Enable Optimism users to donate ANY token in the Optimism network to their favorite nonprofits.   Reward donors to verified projects on Optimism with GIVbacks streamed for the next several years on Optimism.   Allow GIV holders on Optimism to stake and lock their tokens in GIVpower for governance rights to boost projects. Boosted projects show up higher on our home page and give more GIVbacks to their donors.   Reward GIVpower users that have staked and locked their GIV will earn a yield in GIV streamed for the next several years on Optimism .   Our rewards programs are sticky. When a donor donates to a verified project, or when someone stakes GIV, they get some liquid GIV and a GIVstream that will stream GIV to them until Dec 2026. This means, any donor or staker on Optimism will be coming back to the Optimism network to collect their GIV for the next several years. Giveth has been active in the Ethereum community since 2016 and isn\u2019t going anywhere, our token is more likely to have value for the next several years than most teams that apply to this grant process IMO. This grant will be used to provide long term liquidity for GIV to keep users on the chain for the next several years. Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.: We are targeting nonprofits, public goods projects, Refi projects, impact DAOs and crypto donors of all kinds. More specifically: Nonprofits: Any organizations in the non-profit space regardless of the regional scope and legal status. We aim to target it with partnerships with organizations already working with many of these actors. Public goods projects: Any project working for public goods, including community projects, activists and all efforts intending to provide public goods. This is the broader target. We aim to target it with partnerships with organizations already working with many of these actors. ReFi projects & Impact DAOs: Web3 native projects focused on making a positive impact. These projects are growing exponentially. In a very niche space where Giveth is well-positioned to capture. Crypto Donors: Basically anyone who has crypto and isn\u2019t a 100% full on degen. This is a large market, which depends on the world situation. For instance, the war in Ukraine and the earthquakes in Turkey & Syria turned many Ukrainian and Turkish crypto users into donors, even if they didn\u2019t probably didn\u2019t consider themselves donors before those events. Over $50 million was raised by Ukraine projects in crypto and over $6 million for Turkey and Syria so far.    Chainalysis \u2013 21 Feb 23    Crypto Donations Provide Fast Relief for Earthquake Victims in Turkey and... With a death toll now surpassing 47,000, the devastating earthquake on February 6 in Turkey and Syria have left many worldwide feeling powerless to help. Additionally,  Est. reading time: 4 minutes       Just last week 1inch donated $100k to Earthquake Relief projects on Giveth. As a DAO that doesn\u2019t pay taxes, Giveth is the natural choice for donations as 1inch can\u2019t get a tax deduction, but they can receive GIVbacks. Our verification team and GIVbacks for donors sets us apart from most of the crypto donation space and we are confident that as more people realize that donating on Giveth is a safer and more rewarding experience than donating to random addresses they find on Twitter, we will capture more and more of the crypto donation market. Expanding to Optimism helps us achieve that mission. Gnosis chain is our only chain for low cost transactions, but it has very few users. Optimism is very aligned with our mission and has a much higher TVL. We expect many of our future donors to prefer to use Optimism for cheap donations as opposed to Gnosis Chain. How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: Donors would be able to donate on Optimism. When they do, they will get GIVbacks which will lock them to the Optimism chain as they will get a stream of GIV until Dec 2026. Projects will have a donation address on Optimism and will receive donations at that address as long as they maintain their project on Giveth in good standing. GIVpower users will consider bridging to Optimism to get exposure to the APRs for staking and locking their GIV, which will lock them to the Optimism chain as they will get a stream of GIV until Dec 2026.

(TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): Since our launch at the end of December last year, we have helped raise over $1.5 million to projects on our platform. We have this dashboard with key stats of the platform connected to our backend https://analytics-dashboard-blue.vercel.app/ But here is a summary of the main metrics from December 2021 to March 2023 (15 months): Projects created: 2015 Donors: 3384 Total donations value: 1.56 Million USD Who are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?: There is no competition in funding Public Goods!But at our core right now, we are a donation platform so some similar projects are:GitcoinClr.fundThe Giving BlockNone of these platforms have launched on Optimism. Additionally, we believe we complement these projects well as we are running our benefits for donating 24/7 as opposed to quarterly rounds & have key differentiators like the GIVbacks program. We have integrated The Giving Block Projects on Giveth and are actively collaborating with Gitcoin. (Gitcoin & Giveth Partnership - QF integration + beyond! - GIVernance - Giveth Forum: Join the conversation to shape the Future of Giving Please link to code audits (if any): The GIVeconomy contracts were formally audited by Oleksii Matiiasevych, one of the devs that initially developed Tether & the first person to ever create a token on Ethereum. The audit found four minor issues that have since been resolved. Audit link: code-reviews/Giveth GIVeconomy Contracts Code Review.pdf at main \u00b7 lastperson/code-reviews \u00b7 GitHub The code was also reviewed closely by Jordi Baylina from PolygonHermez, Eduardo Diez of DAppnode, and several other well respected members of our community. We have many white hat friends, as we were started by the White Hat Group, and they help us pro bono a lot, but we rarely get formal reports. Team: Giveth has an incredible community of well over 50+ active contributors, below are many of the active contributors people may know.  1596\u00d7896 309 KB  Who are your founders?: Griff Green is the most active co-founder of Giveth. He is also a co-founder of Commons Stack, Trusted Seed, Praise & dappnode. Community manager for TheDAO, led the crisis response effort for TheDAO Hack and first Parity Multisig Hack from every angle, co-founder of the White Hat Group and led the creation of Token Engineering Commons. Advisor for PolygonID, PolygonHermez, brightID, Doingud, and steward for Gitcoin, ENS & actually Optimism as well ;-D Jordi Baylina, Grace Torrelles and Vojtech Simetka are the other founders, however Giveth was founded nearly 7 years ago and these 3 only occasionally contribute to Giveth. Jordi contributes the most by writing and reviewing most of our smart contracts, including the ones we will deploy on Optimism. What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal? We have a strong & robust team that has led us to the successful launch of the system we are proposing on Gnosis Chain where we have grown our community up until now. We intend to further grow our community in Optimism. Is this your first Web3 project?: No. If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): TheDAOWhite Hat GroupAragon (https://aragon.org/)Status (https://status.im/)iden3 (https://iden3.io/)Polygon Hermez (https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-hermez/)1hive (https://1hive.org/)xDai - now Gnosis Chain (https://www.gnosischain.com/)Commons Stack (https://commonsstack.org/)Token Engineering Commons (https://tecommons.org/)brightID (https://www.brightid.org/)dappnode (https://www.dappnode.io/)General Magic (https://www.generalmagic.io/)  Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 110k $OP (Max) How do you justify the size of the grant?: 100K $OP will be given out in 20k milestones based on usage and will be used to create an LP against GIV to allow GIV to have a secondary market on Optimism. Giveth will use its own GIV and pair it with the OP to make a 50/50 liquidity pool on the best dex as advised by the Optimism Grants committee (probably Velodrome if we can get GIV whitelisted). This would make the liquidity about the same as Gnosis Chain. It is important that the liquidity is relatively close to the liquidity on other chains otherwise it may incentivize people to bridge their GIV to other chains for better liquidity. 10k $OP would be rewarded to the first 500 verified public good projects on Giveth that add an $OP donation address. This is important to bootstrap the network effect of Optimism on our platform To allow GIV to be given to donors on Optimism, we would need to have a liquid market on Optimism, otherwise we would be driving people off the chain. This is why we\u2019d want to build our way up to a sizable LP with Optimism. This OP will not be sold, it will simply be held in an LP for perpetuity. We would be very happy to hold it in a multisig with other members of the optimism community so that Giveth doesn\u2019t have control over it if that is deemed necessary. In my honest opinion, this is much better than liquidity mining. We can do that though. We can create an OP/GIV farm on Optimism and \u201crent\u201d the liquidity, but Sushiswap APRs for OP/ETH is >80% so for a OP/GIV pool, I would expect it to find a balance at ~150%. This would mean around 100k OP would get us $400k of liquidity for <6 months (assuming the price stays stable). We can do that and I will outline some cool ways to do so in comments below in the next few days as an alternative, but we truly believe a token swap approach is much more beneficial for the Optimism ecosystem, so that is what we have included in this proposal.  Roadmap and Distribution Plan Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan. How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. See the no sale rule here 1): Formatting in Discourse is hard so I made a table in this Google Doc:  docs.google.com    Giveth x Optimism Milestones Milestones Onboard Objective for this funding: Primarily we\u2019d like to ask for 400K Optimism to create an LP against GIV to allow GIV to have a secondary market on Optimism. 20k USD out of this grant would be distributed to support part of the...       1452\u00d71566 361 KB  1446\u00d71238 208 KB  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?: These metrics should all be achieved within 12 months of launching Giveth on Optimism. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: I believe this is answered above. I will also link again our blog on our goals for 2023, we have lots of important milestones there as well: 2023 Giveth Looking Forward. \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Watch out, 2023, Giveth is\u2026 | by Dr Suga | Giveth | Jan, 2023 | Medium Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: I believe this is answered above. If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: We will be using the GIV token for rewards so we don\u2019t need to be continually asking for more funds from Optimism and users will stay on Optimism to claim the GIV tokens that will be streamed to them until the end of 2026. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): Our main multisig on Optimism is at 0x4D9339dd97db55e3B9bCBE65dE39fF9c04d1C2cd the other contracts will be deployed if this proposal passes and we can link to the deployment document with all addresses.  Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how? & Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Optimism is sorely missing a donation platform to fund public goods where they can donate whenever they want & get rewarded for their support. If someone wants to donate some of their profits to a for-good project, they must bridge to mainnet first. Giveth wants to change that!Not only can Giveth bring hundreds of already verified Public Goods projects to the Optimism network, we can also integrate and enhance the retroPGF system.We can enable projects on Giveth to raise funds on Optimism and any donation to verified projects on Optimism would get up to 80% of their donation back in GIV tokens through our GIVbacks program on Optimism.GIVbacks is a Public Goods lego that could plug in nicely to the Retroactive Public Goods Funding program. Any funding to a verified project would receive GIVbacks. For example if a project (outside of the Optimism team) is providing an alternate RPC, they could qualify as a verified project and donations to support them would be eligible for GIVbacks.Learn more about GIVbacks here: What if giving gave back? Using web3 to evolve philanthropy. | by Lauren | Giveth | Medium Giveth enables anyone working to produce public goods to raise funds with crypto.But this is just the beginning. Giveth hopes to help projects evolve past donations and sacrifice. Public goods are not just a feel-good, heartwarming act of kindness. They are a $25 Trillion USD global market, and in our opinion the most overlooked web3 opportunity. We have the opportunity to disrupt this sector with web3 tooling & Giveth is positioned to lead the way. Check out this awesome video from Devcon with Griff describing this opportunity at length, while also giving a shout out to OP and RPGF. (The Biggest Web3 Opportunity No One is Talking About! by Griff Green | Devcon Bogot\u00e1 - YouTube)Crypto donations are witnessing incredible growth. The total annual volume of crypto donations grew by 1,558% or more than 16x from 2020 to 2021, (Source: TheGivingBlock) and with well over $50 Million USD in crypto donated to support Ukraine, 2022 likely saw a similar increase. Giveth can bring this growing use case to Optimism. Is your project Optimism Native?: No.  Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes ",

I woud love to see this come to fruition, and as a leader of our comms team at Giveth, and product owner of the GIVeconomy, I would be super happy to support through the process from chain integration, to comms campaigns for Optimism usage, to GIVbacks implementation, to creating an GIV <> OP LP & beyond. I think we have a lot of synergy between Giveth & Optimism, especially with our shared mission to use web3 to effectively fund public goods, and I completely agree that giving Optimism users a donation platform with the reputation, proven systems & functionality of Giveth adds a critical donation lego to (and fills in a clear gap of) the Optimism network. Yesterday I worked hard putting together this tweet thread outlining Giveth\u2019s past contributions to Optimism for RetroPFG, and it has really stuck in my head the importance of having multiple EVM chains for scalability. I strongly believe that adding a donation platform to Optimism makes Optimism more versatile in its abilty to provide well-rounded public goods funding solutions - both for projects seeking retroactive funding, and for those who don\u2019t qualify - and this is a value add to the entire web3 ecosystem. Also, would love to add to this: As of today, we have an incentivized web3 donation platform on Mainnet, Gnosis Chain and Polygon! This 1st level integration of a new EVM chain on Giveth is a great proof-of-concept. Our devs are well-practiced  ",

                    "content": "We suggested using 100k OP to create a liquidity pool above, however we understand that this novel approach may not be acceptable, so as an alternative we would like to offer using our GIVstream contracts to create a Regen Farm (a Regen spin on classic liquidity mining). We worked with Shapeshift and CultDAO to reward users with a mix of streaming tokens and liquid tokens, we can deploy this type of farm on Optimism as well.We would create an OP/GIV 50/50 LP and reward people who stake the LP on the GIVfarm with and OPstream. This is much better than traditional Liquidity Mining because it naturally attracts longterm supporters over short term mercenary liquidity providers. We would set the rewards to be 10% liquid at the day of the launch and 90% OPstream, with the OPstream ending in Dec 2026 just as the GIVstream. We would request 100,000 OP for this as well, following the same metrics.You can find more details on Regen Farms in this blog post and in the documentation. ",

                    "content": "Thank you for submitting this grant application! Throughout the application process, this forum thread will be one of the official means of communication. Please be sure to monitor it for updates over the course of the review period. At this stage, applications are mainly being reviewed for completeness, and nothing at this stage should be construed as support or opposition by any members of the Grants Council. A little bit of feedback (keep in mind that this is just one council member\u2019s opinion and does not represent the views of the entire council):     Griff:  To allow GIV to be given to donors on Optimism, we would need to have a liquid market on Optimism, otherwise we would be driving people off the chain. This is why we\u2019d want to build our way up to a sizable LP with Optimism. This OP will not be sold, it will simply be held in an LP for perpetuity. We would be very happy to hold it in a multisig with other members of the optimism community so that Giveth doesn\u2019t have control over it if that is deemed necessary.   In my opinion, this part of the proposal is what really causes some hesitation. Given that $GIV is an inflationary token, I view any kind of liquidity pair with grant-provided $OP a direct subsidy to the $GIV token price which is something I\u2019d like to avoid. I\u2019m happy to change my mind if there is anything that you can clarify on this front. I think the much stronger parts of the proposal are those incentivizing projects to launch campaigns on Optimism on your platform. In order to make the proposal stronger, my suggestions would be to reduce the size of the grant and eliminate the liquidity pool provision. Giveth is a great platform and it would be great to see you have a home on Optimism. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions. ",
