Proposal The one and only benefit for optimism is that you\u2019ll fund a public good and that defillama is helpful for people looking to get analytics on optimism. We believe that it\u2019s important that we stay completely neutral, so we will strictly not offer any benefits to optimism for this grant. We won\u2019t prioritize anything related to optimism due to this grant and we will treat optimism exactly the same whether this grant gets accepted or not. In other words, we are asking for a donation. We believe that our previous work speaks for itself and since we are neutrality maxis we don\u2019t want to go into any deal that would bias us.

Perhaps some information on how their plans for data availability and transparency positives impacts everyone in crypto could be shared so not as to change their stance on remaining neutral. Also, they have big ambitions that this Public Goods funding will play a big role in - which again - indirectly benefits us all.
