                    "content": "I\u2019ve chatted with both Rune and Luca separately, I would say I have \u2018friendly\u2019 relations with each, and both of them seem willing to collaborate in good faith to work through this. First of all my recent statements in chat about \u201csecuring supermajority vote\u201d should not be interpreted like there is some coalition with a specific agenda, there is not, this was intended as a provocative statement to highlight that useless overpaid delegates who talk a lot are in a small minority and can simply be ignored. Second, I inferred that the borrower was voting Yes on the LOVE proposal because 1) it was a big change structural change and 2) it was done at the same time as a massive borrow took place on Aave. Borrowing to vote \u201cno change\u201d is not a sustainable play, it only makes sense to do it if you can use it to gain some kind of ground. Third, the timing of the different attacks against me and against the Rai system made it seem very much like it was coming from people who were not happy with the fact that I was interrupting this vote, which made me further think it was coming from the \u201cyes\u201d side. I realize now those attacks might have actually not come from either of these sides, and that actually it is some completely external threat. All that said, I want to emphasize that I am not in favor of the MetaDAO proposal any more than I am in favor of the LOVE proposal. I think both are under-developed and possibly existentially bad moves. I think at this point we need to step back and not make ANY drastic actions until we solve the core problem that governance here is completely dysfunctional, and that can be done by reducing complexity and clarifying how the current voting system actually works at the core. In one of my angrier posts I said something like \u201cwhy don\u2019t you guys let me and Rune design a better collateral onboarding system\u201d, but now I see that as being misinterpreted to mean I support his particular endgame proposal. That\u2019s not true, what I should have said it \u201cI want to figure out who is a good-faith contributor and who is a sockpuppet, and design something without getting divide-and-conquered by shills who talk all day but don\u2019t make or do anything.\u201d What is clear to me now is that neither of these proposals has \u201cbroad\u201d approval. This is exactly the outcome that you can expect when governance is a simple majority vote system! Here I made a little diagram showing roughly how I intended the governance contract to be used. It is very rough, don\u2019t take it as a complete description of either Maker nor any new system. I made it to emphasize just one thing, which is that approval voting was always my intended design, and the result is that the system is resistant to governance attacks and is not constantly preoccupied with contentious political proposals. Right now we need it more than ever. (Here \u201cold model\u201d and \u201cnew model\u201d is in the context of my new projects \u2013 here we would be adopting something like the \u201cold model\u201d, because Maker is rooted in the ds-chief contract).  Screen Shot 2022-07-30 at 5.08.57 PM3262\u00d71798 466 KB  The good news is again that the system is still grounded in the ds-chief contract, and it can still safely be transitioned to a state where approval voting is used to then also select delegates. With a set of broadly supported core system delegates, we can start untangling this mess without every single vote being split down the middle based on essentially political lines. I think we should do this before committing to a direction for RWA onboarding policy (but I don\u2019t object to small case studies with responsibly low debt ceilings so that progress is not totally stalled). I can try to lead by example and show what approval voting for a set of delegates looks like in vivo in parallel projects for a little bit, this way Maker does not need to experiment with fundamental structural changes and can adopt it once it is clear that it actually works. Again the only thing I think everyone can agree on now is 1) we need to not make drastic governance changes or add too much more \u201ccontentious\u201d collateral types, and 2) there is at least a possibility that an approval voting system can help us fix all these problems. Once again I am in contact with both Rune and Luca and we are all at least in theory willing to work together in good faith. If you are aware of a large bloc of voters that feels that neither of these represents the best interests of Dai and the Maker system, feel free to DM me on discord and I will hear you out. Please be aware I am very much on guard for shills and sockpuppets, those kind of actors stick out like glow-in-the-dark clowns to me, it\u2019s like I have special goggles that let me see even the tiniest bit of fluorescent material from a mile away.

Those proposals have massively different scopes, ambitions, and actually could partially be contained one (LOVE) within the other. I believe there is no need for me to address publicly that I have not been involved, neither I know of anyone involved, in the MKR borrowing or in any vicious attack to you or the RAI project - of which by the way I am a massive fan. I would also add that the inference that a borrowing position would naturally be open to support change rather than protect the status quo doesn\u2019t seem as straightforward to me. Hence, I\u2019d prefer to remain agnostic. I have distanced myself from the day-to-day of Maker after the LOVE vote, but I remain a community member and a huge fan and supporter of the project. I have my own ideas, but I am keeping those to myself as an independent thinker for the time being. I have no affiliation to any group nor any investor that is significantly exposed to Maker. At the same time, I would be happy to provide my views and collaborate on things I believe in. I think your intentions to move away from simple majority voting is to me at the highest priority of what Maker would need. I am looking forward to hear more. ",

Being a contributor to @Real-World-Finance since February 2021, I agree with the general statement. My only query will be to define \u201cresponsibly low\u201d. A reasonable interpretation may be had by reference to term, counter-party risk (financial and/or experience), legal structure risk, and likely impact on the surplus buffer if there is a negative credit event. Up to now, many MIP6 applications require bespoke structuring (which takes time) and/or an imprudent mixture of the above factors. I fully support the premise that we not stall progress. This is critical as Maker has a meaningful head-start in this space. Frankly, I think \u201cprogress\u201d is where Maker can really exercise leverage to push the envelope in a manner that traditional finance cannot (for whatever reason). What I mean is that Maker should move on from TradFi with a crypto overlay. Maker should (1) push for digitally native assets (or at least assets that are more likely to be digitized than not) and (2) focus on assets that already have (or have the potential to have) digital oracles associated with them. I think you can then layer on a \u201cclean money\u201d thesis as a 3rd metric. As an example (though not perfect) is an account receivable created upon the delivery of a cargo of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The account receivable is an IOU and can be easily digitally native. The LNG is electronically metered and scientifically measured by an independent 3rd party at delivery (i.e., an oracle), the LNG price will be calculated by reference to a public benchmark (Brent, TTF, Henry Hub, or JKM (i.e., an oracle)), and the buyer (typically a credit worthy entity given the $ involved) has 7-10 days to pay (short-term). There are some shortcomings with the above proposal (which I will not get into here), but directionally this is where Maker can excel. Another example may be hash-power backed loan obligations as introduced by @teej. HBLO Maker can safely push the envelope in a responsible manner and capitalize on its existing leadership role. We need to have a thoughtful discussion on the opportunities. ",

I can try to lead by example and show what approval voting for a set of delegates looks like in vivo in parallel projects for a little bit, this way Maker does not need to experiment with fundamental structural changes and can adopt it once it is clear that it actually works. Again the only thing I think everyone can agree on now is 1) we need to not make drastic governance changes or add too much more \u201ccontentious\u201d collateral types, and 2) there is at least a possibility that an approval voting system can help us fix all these problems.   Echoing CPs points and will add: We have two simultaneous truths in RWA land:  On-chain RWAs will invariably be re-ledgered and on-boarded, we just don\u2019t know exactly how. All of us working on this intersection know, intuitively, that we\u2019re moving in the right direction. But the space is unlikely to develop in a predictable way. In several years the term \u201cRWA\u201d will be an anachronism. It will just be \u201cassets\u201d as everything will live on crypto rails. RWAs will not benefit from the same trust-minimization as crypto assets out of the gate.  When you consider these two in concert, as the only senior secured lender in RWA land, we can either: A) Take no balance sheet risk, wait for infrastructure to develop (years) before touching RWAs. B) Take strategic, well-aligned risks and progressively push the innovation we want to see in the world. Incentivize existing assets to be re-ledgered (ReBirth) and creating novel digitally-native assets with better oracles (Birth) CP touches on deterministic LNG receivables, one of MANY examples of Birth assets that Maker can create internally or more likely incentivize an external specialist to package and offer us. The other component, Rebirth, is today more important to progressing because it does not require new tech. To maintain momentum and maintain our edge in RWAs, we should continue onboarding RWAs in a way that ensures each deal is better than the last. Further, given that on-chaining RWAs seems to be one of the theses the market is rallying around right now, maintaining progress is critical for MKR as an asset. ",

I don\u2019t know enough to refute it. But LNG is notably cleaner than other fossil fuels. And blanketing all fossil fuels as dirty and thus shameful is a luxury of the developed world. The question is more so: is pursuit of LNG a net good at this juncture? Some fodder:  We abandoned domestic LNG projects and pipelines due to ESG obsession. With that went energy independence. Enter War: now we are paying the price with inflation, eroding the earnings power of the lower and middle classes. Not great for the \u201cS\u201d of ESG. Further, the US\u2019 premature pursuit of \u201cclean energy\u201d has forced us to pander to countries with horrendous human rights histories. Even worse for the \u201cS\u201d. Another piece, while there\u2019s some nuance to wrt to LNG as \u201cclean\u201d, there\u2019s even more nuance wrt to clean money as a core principle of the DAO. With that said, if you read the piece CP, Eric, and I wrote, there is reference to a similar receivable (inherently digital, oracle-produced) but for solar energy.    Charting a Path for RWAs Part 2: The Maker Standard   As a working example, let\u2019s think about an oracle-driven solar receivable. The energy output of solar panels is electronically metered. That digital representation of output, combined with an oracle of the applicable $/kwH, represents a digital account receivable, a novel RWA.   CP worked in LNG for 15 years so is probably using an example that he\u2019s an expert on. There are all kinds of novel assets that we can accelerate the creation of. The point is that many industries remain untouched by capital markets. We can make an impact. ",

I think I read last week that prices are up 1400% since the summer of 2020. That\u2019s bananas for an industry that incurs cost of $200M++ just to build 1 LNG carrier.

From my understanding most of the natural gas and LNG developments/exploration/production activity, has been historically dominated by a national oil company \u201cpartnership\u201d with an international oil company. Think BP/Shell, or the Senegal Gov doing bizz w/USA, China, France, India, UAE, etc. As far as Funding capital costs\u2014it typically involves financing across a long development cycle. It also involves both project management and \u201cassurances\u201d that the local authorities/govs are supportive of the project. Otherwise whats the point. All-in-all the partnership will need to find credit worthy offtakers of the NG, or LNG\u2014so that the government and companies + lenders can begin to recover cost and generate revenues. Hence, you\u2019ll more than likely need some serious boots on the ground by an internal project finance team. ",
