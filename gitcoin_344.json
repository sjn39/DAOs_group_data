                    "content": "Introduction The Gitcoin Program Beta Round is the second set of Gitcoin Program QF rounds that will run on the new decentralized Grants Stack. The planned dates for this round are April 25th to May 9th and there will be 5 Core Rounds each with a distinct matching pool:  Climate Solutions Ethereum Infrastructure Web3 Community & Education Web3 Open Source Software ZK Tech  As we continue our efforts to decentralize and shape the new Gitcoin Grants Program, these rounds were chosen from a larger pool by the community through a Snapshot vote.  340\u00d7649 62.5 KB  Note: There will also be a number of externally operated Featured Rounds that run in this same 2-week window; the details of which are still being determined. The purpose of this post is to outline the general eligibility policy that ALL grants must meet in order to qualify for acceptance into any of the 5 core rounds. In addition to the general eligibility, grants must meet the extra criteria for the round they are applying for. The description of each specific round\u2019s eligibility criteria is listed after the general eligibility policy. The PGF team is asking DAO contributors, stewards, and community members to carefully read these eligibility requirements and provide feedback or engage in an open discussion where needed. The requirements are subject to change but will be locked in before the application window opens.  Gitcoin Program General Eligibility Policy This policy is set and enforced by the FDD & PGF workstreams of the GitcoinDAO and is ratified by the GitcoinDAO stewards. The following are not permitted in Gitcoin-operated rounds:   Hateful Content - No racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful speech, no discrimination  Deceiving Users - Malicious content that could cause harm or unintended consequences to users  Falsification - Any type of hacking to falsify a contribution is prohibited. No encouraging or enabling Sybil attacks or other forms of malicious manipulation of the grants platform or the Gitcoin community  Fraud & Impersonation - Claiming to be a brand or person you are not. The Grant owner must be directly affiliated with the project, the funds must go to the project, and be used for the purposes stated in the Grant\u2019s details  Quid Pro Quo & Bribery - The Grant may not have any form of quid pro quo that has financial value (a scenario in which a user gets some additional unique benefit/award in return for their donation)  Advertising - Using grants to showcase something you are selling like a token sale or NFT drop  Well-capitalized projects - Not have prior external funding of over $500k USD via venture capital, token launches, or NFT sales  Grantees cannot be subject to sanctions, and funding cannot be used in violation of any applicable law, rules, or regulations (for example those addressing sanctions, financing of terrorism, and anti-money-laundering) Grantees can be eliminated from consideration in the round if they are found to be encouraging or enabling Sybil attacks or other forms of malicious manipulation of the grants platform or the Gitcoin community.  Additional criteria that projects must meet:   Project Update - If you are a returning grantee, you must provide an update on what work has been accomplished since the last grant round your project received funding from Verified Github (if applicable) and/or Twitter account   Web3 OSS Round Eligibility To qualify for the Web3 OSS round, in addition to meeting the criteria outlined in the program policy above, grants must:  Be an open-source project with meaningful Github activity in the prior 3 months that has demonstrated work completed towards the project\u2019s mission Primarily focused on developing on top of or advancing the broader Ethereum and/or Web3 industry   Ethereum Infrastructure Eligibility  The Grant must be in support of, or directly advancing the Ethereum ecosystem. This includes areas like:  Core client devs (e.g., geth / nethermind; prysm / lighthouse) Tooling providers (e.g., hardhat / ethers.js) Those showcasing the power of critical ecosystem ideas (e.g., dark forest with zero-knowledge proofs) Those doing the hard work of educating developers (e.g., Austin (Gitcoin) / Nader (DeveloperDAO))   The Grant must be open source (if software-related)   Climate Solutions Round Eligibility   Projects must be at least 3 months old. Newer projects should establish themselves and submit to the next round.   The Grant must be primarily focused on climate solutions (the group may do other work but the grant proposal should be directly related to climate solutions). The proposal should explicitly outline how this project will help reduce GHGs or is an important core infrastructure for web3 climate solutions.   Grantees who received funding in previous rounds should report on project progress since GR15 or the Alpha round. We understand that some projects may have less progress given the timing of Alpha round disbursements. This will ensure accountability to supporters and also help encourage contributors by showing what you\u2019ve been accomplishing.   All returning grantees are expected to update their proposal, in addition to project updates the proposal should include lessons learned from previous work and how they will use the additional funding from the upcoming round. The updated proposal should indicate how additional funding will help the project meet its goals, and include a rough timeline for the project overall.   There is a general expectation that projects are within the \u201crealm of viability\u201d.  Even if a project may be at a very early stage, it still must seem credible to the average person with an understanding of web3 technology and climate solutions. Grantee founders must genuinely intend to build the project, and the project must not broadly be considered an impossibility.     Web3 Community & Education Round Eligibility The Web3 Community & Education Round is a new category that has not been a Gitcoin Program round in the past; however there have been similar ecosystem rounds called \u2018Media\u2019 and \u2018Community\u2019. Reflecting on the Alpha Rounds and all the legacy \u201cMain Round\u201d grants, there were many great projects that couldn\u2019t join OSS due to specific \u201cactive OSS repo\u201d requirements. In GR12 and before we had mutually exclusive categories like \u201cinfrastructure\u201d \u201cdapps\u201d and \u201ccommunity\u201d - and this would be like the old community category, which included podcasts, newsletters, educational projects, journalists, and more. As we\u2019ve now split open-source software into its own round, we will run this Web3 Community & Education Round to focus on non-software related projects that are helping to push the Web3 space forward. The requirements to be accepted in this round are outlined below*:   The project must be focused on improving the Web3 ecosystem. Examples of projects which may fit are those that are:  Growing new communities Providing educational resources Creating content (youtube tutorials, newsletters, blog posts, podcasts, etc) Protecting users by investigating bad actors DAOs focused on socialization Onboarding new users Working on inclusion/diversity/advocacy    *Note: As this is a new Core Round category, we\u2019d love to have the community weigh in and narrow the scope or suggest more objective criteria.  ZK Tech Round Eligibility   The Grant must be in support of, or directly advancing the ZK tools, libraries, community, or protocols.   The Grant may not have any form of quid pro quo that has financial value (a scenario in which a user gets some additional unique benefit/award in return for their donation)   The Grant owner must be directly affiliated with the project and the funds must go to the project.   The Grant should be focused on accomplishing the following for ZK:   Usability - improving the user experience of zero-knowledge tools/libraries, not zero-knowledge rollups. This could also be technical education and documentation.  Tooling - improving the developer experience or making it easier to develop applications utilizing zero-knowledge proofs or technology.  Applications - technical implementations of zero-knowledge proofs and circuits, not simply applications built on top of zero-knowledge roll-ups.    The project should not have its own token or have raised VC funding (let\u2019s keep the funds for the aspiring projects!)   The project must have been active in the last 3 months - social media and GitHub.   The project should have demonstrated either concrete progress, or evidence of a substantive technical roadmap that clarifies how ZK technology will be used and advanced.   The Grant deliverables should be open source.    Conclusion These eligibility requirements are designed to ensure we capture and provide funding to the highest quality projects in each category. As a reminder, the requirements are not yet set in stone and we are highly encouraging the community to discuss what makes sense and what could be changed. Thanks for reading this far and stay tuned for more updates! ",

I\u2019m not sure we can really do a formal snapshot vote on the many various criteria and limitations, however, it would be INCREDIBLY helpful to get more input from the community: Stewards, grantees, donors, etc. Some topics I\u2019d love others to weigh in on, not all mentioned in the main post: Multiple entries - Should one single grant be allowed in multiple rounds? Multiple core rounds (ie. OSS and Eth Infra)? A core and a featured round (ie. OSS and DeSci)? Can/should we as Gitcoin even moderate featured round reviews and approvals? And on a similar wavelength - should a single person be allowed to have multiple different grants in the same round? Should they be allowed to have multiple different grants in different rounds? Is this really enforceable in an \u201canon-friendly\u201d platform? Quid Pro Quo - We\u2019ve always had issues drawing the line here. Does a POAP count as QPQ? Does a Discord role count as QPQ? We\u2019ve tried to draw the line at \u201cmonetary value\u201d, but we\u2019ve also seen things like POAPs act as incentives even without \u201cvalue\u201d - and of course, we get into potential airdrop speculation/farming territory. NFT \u201csales\u201d or drops have also been a bit of a gray area - would love to hear what others think about this. Matching caps - are they good? Should they be higher? Lower? Removed altogether? And in general, should we aim to be more strict on approvals to better curate quality projects, or be more lenient and trust the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d? Should brand new projects with little history be allowed in, or should we aim to check and verify past work and some level of prior progress? The issue is we don\u2019t want to discourage new ideas and prevent funding from getting into the hands of very early creators, however, we\u2019ve also had many issues with \u201cgrant emulations\u201d, or essentially, projects that look \u201clegit enough\u201d but in reality were just totally made up for the sake of farming donations. I\u2019ve found the community often has tons of opinions on criteria after a round is over, but ideally, we can start fixing these issues proactively  ",

Maybe in the future we can even weight it, so like the 1st pool a grantee is in has the most matching potential, and it halves in any additional round they get approved for, to give the most relevant grantees priority. For multiple grants, I\u2019m with you on the enforceable aspect lol. We could \u201cstrongly suggest\u201d focusing on one grant per season. But someone can realistically have varying levels of responsibility in different projects, & seems hard to make a judgement call. For me, the potential for fraud outweighs this multi-grant scenario. IMO at least for Beta, we should place a limit of 1 per grantee (to the best of our control). POAPs seem ok-ish to me if they\u2019re not openly offered upfront, Discord roles feel a little weirder. Are we evaluating this just based on what grantees say in their applications, or are we/the public also auditing them during/after the process? Don\u2019t like Gitcoin funding NFT drops, but can imagine exceptions with less typical use cases\u2013e.g. such as using grant funding to teach an underrepresented population like how to empower themselves creatively, releasing an NFT collection to further this cause. Giving NFT\u2019s a soft no for Core Beta Rounds, just due to optics and abuse potential. Matching caps = good  Keep for sure! No opinion on higher/lower In general: my vote is to be more strict to curate quality projects. Know that our whole schtick is being decentralized af, but grants programs literally anywhere else on this planet are way more stringent, with good reason\u2026 free money lol. As we narrow our public goods funding focus by reducing to 5 Core Rounds (which the community gets to decide) while branching out to wider cases with featured rounds, more eyes (and attacks) are going to be on us. Our teams are leaner now, & we literally don\u2019t have as much manpower to identify donation farmers once they\u2019re thru. If my responses seem conservative, it\u2019s because Partnerships works hard on a tight schedule to secure grant round support every single quarter  & it is really not easy in this market, so let\u2019s do what we can to ensure it\u2019s only going to the right places\u2013would rather not work to line the pockets of scammers, even just a little bit lol  Love that we\u2019re fine-tuning the eligibility with these questions before the round happens!
