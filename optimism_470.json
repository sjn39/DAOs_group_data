How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: zkHoldem as a poker platform can potentially become a great tool for the Optimism community to engage and have fun, since poker has always been a common hobby for a large number of degens, traders and VCs. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Currently, despite the heavy interest towards poker within the crypto community (a large number of DeFi/NFT communities have their regular poker night events), there is no on-chain poker platform in existence gaining meaningful traction. We believe that with the launch of zkHoldem, a large number of crypto communities will switch to zkHoldem from its centralized alternatives, and this will drive significant growth to both on-chain activities and community engagement for Optimism as a whole. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: no Number of OP tokens requested: 50,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): We can make to 2% of total supply will be incentive for OP users if there is grant support How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): Pre-launch Marketing Campaign reward: 20%- 20% of the grant token will be used to incentivize a series of marketing effort to attract the initial community for zkHoldem. By completing tasks of our marketing campaign, this group of people will be able to bring in significal exposure and create guerilla marketing effect and therefore help us find the initial user base.Testnet Participant reward: 30%- 30% of the grant token will be used to incentivize participation in our testnet version DApp, which will not only help us further improve the UX and find potential bugs for the DApp itself, but also create the hype needed for the final mainnet launch.Mainnet Poker Mining: 50%-50% of the grant token will be used to incentivize poker players after our mainnet launch. The mining program will be able to fully/partially compensate for the gas fee used during game play, making sure that the frequent users or users playing with large bankroll are properly incentivized to potentially become a regular user even after the reward stops. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: Pre-launch Marketing Campaign reward: 1 monthTestnet Participant reward: 2 weeksMainnet Poker Mining: 3 months Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: Pre-launch:25,000 followers for @zkHoldem twitter account;5,000 community members for zkHoldem discord serverTestnet:5,000 - 10,000 testers;15,000 - 30,000 game playedMainnet:5,000 - 10,000 users and 20,000 - 40,000 game played within first 2 months Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: zkHoldem is providing an online poker platform with incomparable safety and fairness guarantee. Given the large number of online poker players (100M active player worldwide), we believe the initial token incentive is merely to bootstrap our recognition with the space, and once people have formed their user habit, they will become loyal users as long as the fee remains competitive. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): OP Goerli Contract:0x11Bf2d31150a8eEd92C1d1B6F5D84B68dA4dBc83 Confirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here): I have read the Eligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions ",

First, it is not exactly clear how the marketing campaign would function. It\u2019s possible that what you are planning would violate the \u201cno sale rule\u201d that we have for growth experiments grants, but either way we would need some more details. Second, because this is a new/experimental project, it would be great if you could go into more detail in your milestones and also tie those milestones to token distributions. For example, spelling out at what milestones tokens would be distributed. Because we are already getting deeper into this voting cycle, I advise that you refine your application and re-apply for cycle 11 which would also be closer to your launch date. Again, zkHoldem looks like a really cool project, I can\u2019t wait to see what you build! ",
