I read some books and articles, but I have not yet had the opportunity to experience it first hand. Having said that, the more we are trying to figure out things for the core units the more attractive this concept seems in the context of managing distributed organisations. It also seems in sync with the mindset presented by MakerDAO as a whole. Have any of you entertained the idea of applying some (or all) ideas described by the umbrella term of \u201cholacracy\u201d to the newly forming Core Units? \u2026or maybe MakerDAO is already an holacracy but not called like that? I would much appreciate a discussion on this topic.  BTW, this is my first post here. I am Pawe\u0142 and I am working as an engineer in the Oracle / Backend Services Team at Maker.  ",

Though I don\u2019t think anyone ever sat down and said \u2018let\u2019s make this a holacracy.\u2019 Some examples:  \u201cSome have described the authority paradigm in Holacracy as completely opposite to the one of the traditional management hierarchy; instead of needing permission to act or innovate, Holacracy gives blanket authority to take any action needed to perform the work of the roles, unless it is restricted via policies in governance or it involves spending some assets of the organization (money, intellectual property, etc.)\u201d  We do this, at least, we try to. I wrote a post about it ages ago.  \u201cHolacracy specifies a tactical meeting process that every circle goes through usually on a weekly basis. This process includes different phases to report on relevant data, share updates on projects, and open discussions where any circle member can add to the agenda.\u201d  We do this at GovAlpha, I\u2019m fairly sure that other CU\u2019s have similar meetings. The whole open-agenda thing is practiced pretty widely as well (again, at least at meetings in which I\u2019m present.)  \" Holacracy structures the various roles in an organization in a system of self-organizing (but not self-directed) circles. Circles are organized hierarchically, and each circle is assigned a clear purpose and accountabilities by its broader circle. However, each circle has the authority to self-organize internally to best achieve its goals. Circles conduct their own governance meetings, assign members to fill roles, and take responsibility for carrying out work within their domain of authority. Circles are connected by two roles known as \u201clead link\u201d and \u201crep link\u201d, which sit in the meetings of both their circle and the broader circle to ensure alignment with the broader organization\u2019s mission and strategy.\"  So this is the part that we\u2019re half doing. I would say that we have circles, but not a hierarchy of circles (at least not explicitly, at least not yet). One could potentially describe our circle hierarchy as: Multiple Core Unit Circles \u2192 Mandated Actors Circle \u2192 Governance / Community in General. At the least, the mandated actors circle is starting to act a bit like a higher-tier circle over the core units.  So yeah, pretty interesting parallel to draw. Honestly adopting this model more intentionally might be to our benefit, given that we have some weaknesses in areas that this may solve. On the other hand, there is already a fair amount of administrative overhead just with the requirements for governance and transparency - so maybe we don\u2019t want to add additional administrative overhead that this sort of structure would bring.

Indeed, it\u2019s difficult to imagine a total holocracy where you have token holders that wield a good portion of the power; that sort of naturally imposes a management hierarchy. So it seems to me that what you end up with is a management hierarchy with a holocracy encapsulated somewhere vaguely within it. ",

It\u2019s about an hour a week, not a big time investment, and sometimes you get an idea how some aspect of business management can be improved. I don\u2019t think it is important to do something like Holacracy by the book. It\u2019s more important to make incremental improvements. I mean, a large part of Holacracy is the idea that business processes should not be allowed to ossify to the point that the ossified process becomes antagonistic to the goals of the business. ",
