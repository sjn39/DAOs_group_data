We should focus on contributors currently not receiving compensation. Micromanaging SourceCred will add additional overhead to GovAlpha\u2026 is it worth it? We need to figure out whether we want to bring in new contributors or retain current contributors and help improve their value by offering appropriate contributions. Having a marketing team can help improve SourceCred marketing and utilization. How do we identify quality production of work being compensated through SourceCred?  It\u2019s difficult to quantify quality. GovAlpha tried once and it went wonky.    If anybody has opinions or ideas for improvement, please, reach out to GovAlpha.  Dai Liquidity Solution Design   What\u2019s the ideal model to improve Dai liquidity?  UniV2 democratic AMM has a pretty good model for liquidity. Dai should also be able to participate in governance. We can create protocol owners with LP pairs, which helps reduce volatility and collateralization risks.    Flops are not a practical mechanism with MEV front running. It\u2019s essentially a temporary meme. We need a longer-term solution that doesn\u2019t involve flop.   What\u2019s the objective? What\u2019s the problem?  Building MakerDAos general capital beyond Surplus Buffer? We want to create a single solution design instead of having 4-5 various solutions simultaneously.    We can partner with projects on L2 to insensitive them to use Dai as their LP pair which can be effectively used to boost liquidity.  We need available funds to spend on improving liquidity.

Welcome to episode #177 of the Scientific Governance & Risk meeting for MakerDAO. We are joined by a bunch of awesome Maker people who are interested in the protocol. Many of us are working forward. We are here to talk about the current issues at hand, do some reporting on governance, and discuss risks. This has been recorded for YouTube. Let us try not to talk over one another; it is rude and annoying for the recording. We have a chat. You are free to unmute to share questions and opinions. If you are unable or otherwise unwilling to do so, please drop your comment in the chat. I am happy to read. Using the raise hand function is super helpful. That way, I can call on you if you have something to say, and you do not have to worry about jumping over anyone.

Here is the list of the stakeholders involved. Our team and Immunefi Security mainly lead the coordination. The initiative itself covers several different things, such as emergency preparedness, identification of critical infrastructure, and bug bounty programs. It is an umbrella security initiative. We have identified four main milestones, which I will go over individually.   Milestones 16:06  845\u00d7464 171 KB   The first milestone is to sync PagerDuty across all the relevant CUs. Pagerduty is an application emergency to call upon devs and other key people in an incident. We currently have several different engineering and infrastructure teams that use PagerDuty in their silos. Over the next few quarters, we want to get to where PagerDuty is all synced. The components of this milestone are to document all the assigned primary and secondary coordinators and the subject matter experts associated with various emergency types. This is in progress. Immunefi Security is in the process of doing this as well. The second component is identifying the ticketing and incident tracking systems that exist. Immunefi Security is also handling this. After all the people are documented, there will be a migration/sinking plan around PagerDuty.   842\u00d7477 127 KB   We have the completed first version of the emergency playbook and associated resource documents for milestone two. This emergency playbook lists out the basics of how MakerDAO handles and defines emergencies. What are the major buckets of emergencies? What roles has Maker outlined? Who are the subject matter experts? What types of threat monitoring are occurring? There are also buckets of resources for individual emergency types that complement the playbook. This provides collective resources, documents, and templates for missing or critical people, emergency shutdowns, or critical bug scenarios. The third milestone is the Defcon spell library renewal. Defcon is a list of spells that are pre-written in response to emergency scenarios. These can be quickly deployed. There is no intended time for an engineering team to craft the spell. There is currently an existing Defcon spell library, but we need to review them. The three components, all in the To-do Phase, are listed below.   826\u00d7477 111 KB   844\u00d7456 158 KB   The fourth milestone is the complete launch of the Immunefi Security Bounty Program. The first component was implementing the MIP64 Bug Bounty Program for MakerDAO critical infrastructure; this MIP passed and is in existence. There are some amendments in progress to improve the smaller bug bounties. We want to pay and payout bounties without the need for an executive. Immunefi Security can pay out of their operational wallet. These slides are linked to the agenda. Additionally, there is the completion of the draft documentation for the programs. MIP64 outlines the framework of the program. The documentation for the program goes a lot deeper. It identifies the basic infrastructure and outlines the bounty amounts. It is one level deeper of granularity around the program. Lastly, onboarding the stakeholders to the bounty dashboard is the component. There is a bounty dashboard that Immunefi Security is working on that will be a collaborative effort between them and all the CUs that manage critical infrastructure. They need to be able to list manage those bounties.   Team-Led Discussion  David Utrobin  ETHDenver 22:03  There are two things I want to cover here. Number one is to everybody on this call, whether internal or external stakeholders. Please reach out to me in Discord. I would love to invite you to our channel room for ETH Denver. Second, we have a shared Google spreadsheet that lists the events on MakerDAO\u2019s radar, the speeches, and an attendee list of people. The spreadsheet is publicly viewable. I am happy to share editing access with any stakeholders attending, as this is a collaborative effort. Please feel free to add any exciting events you find. Some people will be there earlier and some later. If anyone wants to bring anything up, please do. If not, we can move on to the following discussion.   Goverance Compensation Improvements 23:54  Goverance Compensation Improvements804\u00d7443 114 KB   Prose11: Next, we have governance compensation improvements. This topic came up regarding the discourse on Sourcecred. I believe it was Josh who put up the signal asking if we should remove paid contributors from the DAO and the Sourcecred payment list. Maybe someone can drop the link, or I will in a moment. This comes at an interesting time because GovAlpha is working on our next budget. We are looking at our funded programs, Sourcecred, and considering alternative incentive mechanisms we should be utilizing. Should we even use any at all?  24:55  David Utrobin: Why do people think the Sourcecred should be discontinued for people like delegates? It is additional dynamic compensation that can incentivize more participation. There is a bare minimum that delegates must fulfill to be compensated through the program. Sourcecred is a good system that we do not market properly. It should be kept but not for facilitators and employees. I am curious what people\u2019s thoughts are on the subject.  25:36  Andrew Burban: How much has Sourcecred paid out? I am curious as to what sums it is paying out. I have received some payment but nothing too much since I am not active on the forums. Are people making tens of thousands of dollars doing this?  Prose11: We distribute 5,000 every week. It has been that way for a little bit. You can pull up the site here if you do want to explore. David Utrobin: I think the largest payout is 2,000 a month for an individual. Correct me if I am wrong. Andrew Burban: 2,000 a month to someone already getting full salary may be unnecessary. I am all for taking it down for people already getting compensation. However, this does keep an incentive for people being paid to continue participating more in forums. I favor keeping the money reserved for people who are not already on our payroll.    26:57  David Utrobin: This is a flexible and configurable algorithm. Is there a way to assign specific forum users labels? For example, a delegate here. You still want to give them compensation, but maybe downgrading their compensation multiple?  Joshua: Since posting that signal request and reading all the comments, I think a better approach would be to have two Sourcecred instances. We should leave the current and working Sourcecred instance and add another one that compensates contributors whom the DAO does not already pay. If so, we do not need to rejigger things with the old one; only add a new one for contributors not already receiving compensation. LongForWisdom: One of the big selling points on Sourcecred was that it did not require a lot of micromanagement. Adding another instance and additional rules (i.e., Some people are eligible and others are not); might contradict this nice selling point. Prose11: That is a good point, Long. To add to your point, David, they constantly ship new features for the main Sourcecred instance. But it takes work to update ours properly. There are a couple of features that could be interesting to your point. There is mainly one that allows you to assign a salary to users. They will only get paid if their distribution exceeds that sale amount. In theory, you would be paid extra. However, as Long pointed out, that would mean a lot of management to keep track of the DAO\u2019s payroll and salary increases.    29:24  David Utrobin: I want to bring up Mark\u2019s point in the chat. We need to focus on the outcome and not the solution first. With Sourcecred, the original creation was to increase high-quality forum participation. Sourcecred allows you to assign higher cred scores to specific categories of posts. For example, we wanted more participation in signals or RFC. Is that the case? Feel free to correct me if I am wrong.  LongForWisdom: That is not the case. We wanted to do that, but it was impossible or not easily possible.    30:09  Joshua: One goal important to keep in mind is bringing new people into the Maker ecosystem. That is why I posted a signal thread in the first place. I felt like the main beneficiaries of Sourcecred were people who already knew about and participated actively in Maker. We want to try and bring in new people.  Unknown Speaker:  Sourcecred is a tool to bring in new people while retaining people in the ecosystem. We need to do marketing about Sourcecred, the DAO, and DAO participation in bringing in new people. LongForWisdom: I would agree it is more about retention. The idea is that someone arrives on the forum and is excited about Maker. Sourcecred justifies the time they spent to get up to speed with and absorb the vast information and context. The hope is that this person then becomes a delegate, joins a CU, or further engages in the community.    31:22  David Utrobin: I wanted to make sure that people understand what Sourcecred is because we did not define it in this discussion. Sourcecred is a module tool on the Maker forum that rewards people for participating. You can opt-in by DMing the Sourcecred admin. If you search up Sourcecred in the Maker forum, it will give you instructions to opt-in. Many parameters define your cred scores, such as the number of post likes, post quality, and post length. The cred score is mapped to a Dai payout. You sign up with an ETH address and get paid Dai for participating in the forum.  Prose11: That is a good rundown, David. It is based on PageRank. We have a forthcoming report from GovAlpha that will detail Sourcecred. TL did it. However, it is difficult to empirically determine if TLDR effectively incentivizes people to participate more on the forum. A lot of the reasons why we do it are a bit anecdotal. We are struggling with incorporating Sourcecred and incentives into next year\u2019s budget. Long pitched the idea of an alternative rewards proposal. Instead of rewarding all the involvements in general, it would go through governance directly. There are some trade-offs there but is an alternative we can consider. Governance participation is an interesting problem because it is a collective action problem. Doing the proposals yourself takes a lot of legwork and months of attention to a particular topic. In addition to other downsides, this makes it a bit disadvantageous to become a MIPs author, for instance. I want to see this combated.    34:38  Mark: There are two big components here. Firstly, there is marketing the DAO and Sourcecred. Marketing can provide a solution to attract and build community aspects. This is challenging given that we currently have no marketing team. The second component is retention. There is a broad consensus on not paying facilitators and paying part-time contributors. I assume that most facilitators want part-timers converted to full-timers because full-timers are fully engaged and drive more value than the equivalent number of FTEs. For delegates, there should be a cap for Sourcecred. For example, if you get 12,000, you should not be eligible for Sourcecred. However, if you are starting out and not getting paid much, you would greatly benefit from the generated SourceCred. At this stage, the first part is more important because we want to bring in more people. The community is already highly engaged; we need more people to join this ecosystem and community.  Joshua: Regarding overhead, would drawing the line between part-time and full-time be more work to keep updated than drawing the line between those receiving MakerDAO compensation and those new to the forum? LongForWisdom: Figuring out which people work part-time enough to qualify for Sourcecred is not going to be fun. We do not want to do this because it is difficult and requires us to know how many part-timers who want Sourcecred are paid. This is not feasible.    37:01  David Utrobin: I am curious about the second part of the compensation for successful MIPs and sub-proposals that go from forum posts, through the RFC, into formal submissions and then ratification. We would love to hear more about that idea.  Prose11: Long; feel free to jump in. As you mentioned earlier, we tried a governance\u2019s boost to incentivize hosting more MIPs and signal request with sourcecred. Due to the Patric algorithm, you get peculiar results when you mess with some of the weights. The algorithm builds a graph based on everyone\u2019s likes. It ends up flowing weird if you ratchet up the like weight on one category. We could not find a data set that suggested compensating participation on MIPs and in signal requests or separate puzzles when trying to get that to work. This was what we wanted to do. The counter would take a pool instead and divide it among all the successful proposals for that month. There are many ways to implement it. The idea is that if a proposal goes through governance, in theory, it was a quality signal that the community wanted. Perhaps, we can incentivize that directly rather than incentivizing participation more vaguely. LongForWisedom:  There is a slight downside to doing that. I have not previously alluded that the point of sourcecred is to track various inputs. If someone gives a lot of feedback and gathers a lot of activity, the sourcecred size indicates its usefulness. If we pay for proposals, we lose sight of this almost entirely. For example, we would most likely pay authors and contributors marked down in MIPs. However, there is nothing forcing authors to put contributors in. Then, we must make weird decisions on adding contributors and determining the contribution amount. Joshua mentioned splitting MIPs into smaller MIPs to get more credit payouts. That is an argument in favor of having a pool of bounty money that is split across all successful MIPs in the month. It is pointless to create more.    40:07  David Utrobin: The MIPs framework guards against making too many MIPs. Why would you create three MIPs when you can make one?  LongForWisdom: If someone is trying to abuse it, we would tell them to combine them. Spam is a potential issue, but it is a potential issue with any system we use for incentivizing activity.    40:35  David Utrobin: As Paper asked in the chat, are we trying to pay people to do governance or pay people to show up? In my opinion, it is paying people to be proactive with putting things through governance. Tim Schuppi is an excellent example because he is highly proactive in getting much-needed signal requests and governance polls. We want to incentive that type of behavior.  LongForWisdom: There are a few things we potentially want to incentivize. As Mark mentioned, it is challenging to use sourcecred to bring people to the forum because you risk people trying to abuse it. People are coming in for money and not because of an interest in the protocol. A retention tool could be managing the bridge of engaged community members that do not have the experience or desire to join a CU, become a delegate, or work for a salary. As Paper said, we want people to do MIPs, signal requests, etc.    42:09  Prose11: Cool, I am getting signals to move on here. I want to give a shot to anybody who has not weighed in yet. If you have any thoughts or general ideas about this, please feel free to drop me a DM.   Dai Liquid Solution Design 43:00  849\u00d7412 142 KB   David Utrobin: I could introduce the topic, but we have many heavy hitters\u2019 participants with great opinions. But to generally set us up, Maker has been wrestling with the ideal model for creating Dai and MKR liquidity in the markets. This includes L1 and L2 to bootstrap those markets. We are questioning if we should outsource it to trusted third parties. Do we do a protocol-owned liquidity model where the protocol diverts surplus to funding liquidity position? The conversation I want to set up here is the ideal model? What are the high-level requirements? I want to open up the discussion to the main people with the strongest opinions.  Prose11: There are different elements worth noting here. I saw Wintermute come up with a few things. There are also L2 considerations, and we could focus on liquidity in many other places. I see Makerman raising his hand here.    44:29  Makerman: All right, I will give this a shot. I have not published my work on this. Based on my research, something like the Uniswap v2 liquidity has ideal characteristics for DAO-owned liquidity. My work assumes this. Once a third of the overall liquidity is paired with a stablecoin, you get some nice properties from the AMM model. Firstly, 30% is a big number. It becomes the market and defines every arbitrager as a liquidity source. In terms of price support, with a third of the liquidity, you are paired with Dai at 2000. Even if you eat all the additional liquidity, the maximum downfall with that third is about a factor of nine. That AMM with fees will also basically be the DCA fee and the LP pool. You would set up the LP pool to 30%. We picked a high number but an achievable target. If you earn 10% in that pool, you will soak up 3% of the available liquidity in Dai or Maker. It would take about 20 years to eat all the liquidity to get an estimated 10% per year. The liquidity is rolled through the liquidity contract. You may do the math at 0.3%; it is ideal. The beauty of the v2 liquidity is that it sinks Dai. There is no price range to pull Maker out of that contract. There will always be Maker stuck in that contract at some price, and the same with Dai. You can debate Dai being a liquidity source, but it essentially syncs it all. If the DAO owns the liquidity, the DAO earns fees on that liquidity. We do not even need an auction system if we make that liquidity. We can buy Maker from that contract, pair it with Dai, and stick it back in. We will use an MEV bot that does not get front run on if we are smart. In the end, I have about 20 different reasons: this was part of a proposition scheme for growth. The concept here is that Maker Dai should also participate in governance; it is an ideal way to vest. The v2 liquidity contract for the DAO is conceptually a great play for long-term investors. When you stick it in governance, you can do exactly what Rune wanted, borrowing Dai against that LP. If you look at it as just an investment vehicle, it may be a permanent loss. However, I consider it a misnomer. When you pair a token with a stablecoin, there is no correlation in price. Whereas if you do ETH and Maker, ETH can drop a factor of 2, and Maker will go rate with it. Also, you hardly get any action in terms of fees. But in my work with an uncorrelated stablecoin pairing, you get at least double the fee return and price support. There are many great features of the AMM model, particularly the V25050. You can do other things with other models I studied, such as balancer. However, this one is so compelling. It is democratic to anybody who owns that LP. Only the people are in V3LP and V2 are in front of you, but they share those fees equally. The idea is that they will hoover up liquidity over long periods to where you get 60-80% of the total liquidity and great price support. Then the DAO would have started selling the LP.  48:40  Andrew Burban: Rune wanted to create a Maker Dai LP that could somehow participate in governance. He did much complex math and should be heard talking about it. He has been telling me about it, and I like the idea. This is just one of my thoughts; we can somehow bond the Maker token or absorb the LP ourselves just for people who provide it. They would then get a governance share by having been in this LP. Our liquidity is dire. People want to panic sell while not realizing that we are a liquid market selling several thousand Maker. That is one liquidity solution, and Wintermute is another. Regardless, one of our most pressing issues is getting a liquid market for MKR. I got a couple of friends to buy a small amount of MKR, 8,000 to 10,000. They were getting margin calls on equities. There was a market dump as the bond market sold about 1,000 Maker. Now they realize what that might do to the price. People are familiar with how liquid we know to spread the investment over a given period.  David Utrobin: I understand that liquidity is important for the fundamental security of the protocol. Imagine a situation where there are flop auctions, and MKR is minted and auctioned off. We would still benefit from the situation if there were a huge pool of protocol liquidity to make those trades against. The more liquidity, the less price impact. Is that the right way of understanding? Andrew Burban: Yes. That would be a worst-case scenario where we have to bail out bad debt right now and mint Maker into liquid markets.    52:38  Niklas: There are many valid reasons for LPing and creating liquidity. However, making a liquidity flop is not one of them, especially at our current scale and liquidity state. Even if you get the liquidity to \u201cgood shape\u201d compared to other Defi tokens, you will still not be able to flop 50 or 100 million of bad debt. This is regardless of MKR\u2019s liquidity state. This moves the needle so little that it is practically meaningless from a flop perspective. The real mechanism you have for backstopping is an insurance buffer in the surplus buffer. This is not to say that liquidity provisioning is a bad idea. However, justifying it to make flops more effective is not practical. Flops is a meme.  54:08  Prose11: Does anyone have thoughts on MKR liquidity versus Dai liquidity? Both are going to affect us quite a bit. We had a few discussions with mandated actors about L2 liquidity being soft on Dai in particular.  David Utrobin: I understand that Dai liquidity is a lot more about business development. If you can ensure Dai liquidity, then you can ensure that you are the leading stablecoin in a given network of markets. The MKR liquidity piece is more about the protocol\u2019s health, industrial options\u2019 health, and to some extent building up a capital battery. LongForWisdom: If we are talking about on-chain liquidity in general, the goal should be to make Dai the routing token for all AMM transactions. USDC does this by default. That is the goal because you would get all trading fees. You also get lots of liquidity for collateral.    55:38  David Utrobin: How does the DAO arrive at the ideal solution? Does somebody have to spearhead a proposal that goes into RFC? There is a time sensitivity around this topic. If we do not move quickly enough, we lose an edge. Who should ideally spearhead this kind of initiative? How do we get a wise ideal model?  Prose11: Part of the problem is that you could take many different solutions or routes to provide liquidity. Even arriving at the best ones is not a trivial task.    56:42  David Utrobin: That is also part of the attraction to using somebody like Wintermute. This gives us a more efficient method because it does not have to go through all governance. It also does not need to go around all the stuff we build if a protocol is owned and managed. PaperImperium asked what the exact problem we are trying to solve is? Mediocre attempts end up tying up a lot more resources. Like software solution design, you do not want to do five things simultaneously. Instead, you want to identify the wisest approach and put all your resources into that. That is why I am against trying several intermediate solutions. I am interested in maybe two, for example, a limited engagement with a third-party market Maker while also building out the protocol\u2019s side.  Prose11: There is some question of Dai versus MKR. There are several differences in reasoning. Liquidity comes up because you can provide a giant Maker Dai pair, as Makerman was suggesting. David Utrobin: Lunaman pointed out another approach, partnering with projects on Layer2 and incentivizing them to use Dai as their LP pair. This could be an effective way to boost Dai\u2019s liquidity and develop some business. LongForWisdom: There is only a handful of ways we can do this. We can pay someone to provide liquidity. We can mint Dai, expect it not to be 100% backed, and use that to get liquidity. We can use a surplus buffer, but that limits our capabilities because it is small. Or, we can make Maker and sell that to get the funds we need to order liquidity. Another option is to borrow against MKR on something like Aave to get Dai\u2019s liquidity. This seems a bit sketchy. Another possibility is to use some other protocols. We send the money is also important, but we need to have the money on liquidity.    1:00:01  Prose11: From a technical standpoint, how different is minting Dai to provide an LP pair from the D3M implementation? We mint Dai, deposit it (in this case with Maker), and then receive collateral back in the LP token.  Niklas: One can become severely under collateralized. While it is possible for the other, it is much less likely. The volatility is reduced with an LP token, but it is not gone. With the right market drop, and depending on the size, you could make the system insolvent if you start minting Dai against another token to make an LP. It is also different from a D3M when the market moves down Aave. Okay, fine. People get liquidated. There is a self-sustaining mechanism with this feedback loop to keep Aave solvent. In return, this keeps our D3M solid. We do not have that guaranteed with the LP stuff. What do we do when the market dumps? Do we start unwinding that position? We end up becoming speculators trying to guess the market direction. That sounds like a terrible place to be from a protocol level. You can speculate on the treasury management side, but not on the protocol level. LongForWisedom: One of the problems is all the options are unpalatable. It is also impossible to buy MKR and sell it to buy Dai for liquidity. So, it is not doing much because the service buffer limits us. We must make some trade-offs to deploy significant amounts of liquidity.    1:02:47  Prose11: Have we heard anything from the Wintermute\u2019s side? Maybe Nadia or Burban, have you been in touch?  Andrew Burban: I have not reached out to them for a little while. Nadia\u2019s bandwidth might be stretched thin, but I hope we can organize at least a community call. He had COVID that last time we were on call, so he was all over the place. We should have a dedicated call for this topic if Nadia or someone can coordinate it. We are also getting a quote from LedgerPrime to see our other offers. I am more partial to Ethereum, having met and liked the team. However, the more offers on the table, the better.    1:04:16  Prose11: Lunaman asked a good question: is the goal incentivizing Dai liquidity in LP pairs or on L2 lending platforms. I do not speak for everyone, but yes. L2s are important now, but Dai is generally the go-to pair rather than ETH.  LongForWisedom: The plan is to eventually launch Maker on L2. That would provide Dai liquidity for borrowing.     Open Discussion 1:06:12  Andrew Burban: I am trying to see how they promote our main product and wonder how we can work together. Few projects are showcasing Dai as the token of choice. They have seemed to have developed some well-designed tokenomics for their token; we can borrow some of their ideas. He is posting some on the chat right now. We might use it as a tool for auctioning or hedging positions.  1:08:06  Kirk: I will use the opportunity for a short rant. The whole point of tokenomics is to incentivize good governance. That is what Maker needs. I see it as a secondary issue to the more fundamental problem. The fundamental problem is scaling and integrating with the legacy economy. Lately, there has been a hot buzz in DeFi about the vote escrowed model, and many projects are switching to it. That is not necessarily a bad thing; I think it is interesting. However, I would caution people not to get too caught up in navel-gazing over-designing the sexiest tokenomics mechanism. All that matters is, how do we get Dai used by a billion people? How can we support a meaningful chunk of the global economy using the protocol? If we 10x the Dai supply and the systems\u2019 revenue, the tokenomics does not matter. The tokenomics is not blocking us from doing that. While designing a better tokenomics system is good, I caution people not to get too caught up in it. The MKR token has the right to all future system revenues. I prefer to focus on creating the value first and the more specific tokenomics mechanisms later. I am not saying we should not redesign the tokenomics mechanisms to be better. However, tokenomics has become this totalizing thing. People may focus on it and drop the ball on scaling or other important things. So that is my rant. Thank you for coming.

My name is Payton; I go by Prose11 online. I am one of the Governance Facilitators. A group of awesome people from Maker joined me today. They work for the protocol, care about it, and wish to engage with it. This is our weekly call, where we discuss what has been going on and what needs to be considered by the DAO. As usual, we have an Agenda to get through. We are recording this call. We also encourage this to be an open meeting: we want you to ask questions, give feedback, and engage with the conversations while keeping a respectful manner. You can use the raise hand feature on Zoom to join the speaking queue or speak whenever there is a moment to do it. You can drop a comment on our sidebar if you are unable or unwilling to use your microphone, and we will try to address it when the timing is appropriate. Thanks for joining. As usual, we will get started with our Governance roundup. This will give you an idea of what is going on with our official Votes, the MIPs process, and what is happening in the Forum. There are no Initiative Updates today. We have a light discussion topic: the presentation for the Ambassador Program. We will talk about that at length, and I believe there will be time for open discussion.

Forum at a Glance  Artem Gordon 09:45 Post: Forum at a Glance: February 24th - March 2nd Video: Forum at a Glance  Team-Led Discussion  Pilot Ambassador Program  Kat 17:50  Discussion - MakerDAO Ambassador Program960\u00d7540 168 KB   Hello everyone, I am Kat. I have been around here for a while. I am currently running the Ambassador Program. Hola, \u00a1bienvenidos, amigos latinoamericanos!    Discussion - What is the Ambassador Program?960\u00d7540 210 KB   The Ambassador Program seeks to engage with and provide resources for non-English speaking communities who would like to learn more about MakerDAO and Dai. We are currently doing a pilot in Latin America because it is our largest demographic other than the English-speaking public.   Discussion - Who are the Ambassadors?960\u00d7540 148 KB   We are bringing MakerDAO to new communities and engaging them in their language for them to participate.   Discussion - Pilot Progress960\u00d7540 221 KB   We formally piloted the Ambassador Program with the\u2013now offboarded\u2013Content Production Core Unit. It was adapted from the GovComms Translation Program and the formerly Dai Action Group\u2013no longer in existence\u2013. There is a large amount of want and need for educational material in other languages, especially Spanish.  Since we have created accounts and groups for this program, we have received a large wave of appreciation and excitement from the Spanish-speaking audience\u2013that often felt forgotten\u2013.   We created an infrastructure for the team to have a cohesive voice and consistency in our content. A big thank you to Sebasti\u00e1n, who took the lead on this.  We created a translation guide and designed a workflow that prioritizes and rotates tasks; this ensures consistency in our translations and guarantees that each ambassador has exposure to every material. Therefore, if an ambassador is absent for some time, none of the other ambassadors would have a problem taking over their content.   There are longer-term projects, such as translating our evergreen content. We completed a content audit for English and Spanish resources to prioritize what to translate first and translate from Spanish to English. We have just completed our fiftieth project. Since we have started this pilot, we have made a huge amount of progress on the Maker Operational Manual. We translated the \u201cHow to Vote\u201d video subtitles as well. We would love to work with other Core Units when more educational material content is produced.   Discussion - Pilot Future960\u00d7540 173 KB   Questions 23:22  I will answer some questions from the chat. There is one about translations and languages.  Right now, our pilot program is for Latin America, in Spanish. In the future, if it is successful and we can create our Core Unit, or we integrate with another Core Unit, we would like to see this expand to other regions: Asia, Eastern Europe, would be some of the larger ones. Latin America in Portuguese, instead of Spanish, would also be very helpful.   Andrew Burban: I saw a discussion on the Forum about why not just pay these people in SourceCred. In my opinion, the SourceCred trickle is fine but is probably not enough to cover the scope of what you are trying to do. Could you add a little bit in that regard? Why does this need slightly more budget than SourceCred itself pays out? I am for what you are doing, but some people have just asked why does not SourceCred pay for this?  Kat: This is professional translation material. It is not just participation. Neither is it the kind of participation any of us has online or in the DAO. It is professional work that we need to pay for. Andrew Burban: I do not think this was covered here, but you are asking for a preliminary budget for the first quarter to see how it goes. If everyone likes it, you can expand the budget in the future. But, for the first quarter, you ask for a minimal amount of money, which the DAO can provide. Kat: I agree. Thank you. We need trained professionals to do this. Therefore, we need to provide more incentive than just SourceCred. The cost of running the program for a year at its current state would be our budget times four: a hundred thousand a year. That does not include my salary\u2013I am running it\u2013. This is only to pay our three ambassadors. If this goes well and grows, the cost would be higher because we would expand to more regions.   Chat: Twitter has not been active, with only three tweets so far. Any plans to make it more active?  Kat: Yes. We created that Twitter account about a month ago. That is part of our pilot program. It already has a huge amount of engagement and followers. We do seek to make it more active. We just need our content to be able to post. We posted today about our new Welcome Thread in the Latin America Forum. We also posted about this governance call to have people join. Despite being a very new account, it has been doing well.    27:42  Andrew Burban: Another question people might ask is if you envision this spinning off into a new Core Unit, or you think the Ambassador Program could become a would-be subsidiary of another Core Unit that already exists; so you would not need to become a Facilitator, managing budgets and such.  Kat: It makes sense to be its Core Unit, but if the Community or another Core Unit would like to take it on and take the responsibility, that would be wonderful. I will do it if I need to. And I think it makes sense for this to be its Core Unit.   Chat: Any plans for translating makerdao.world?  Kat: Yes. As our Community Portal, it is one of our top priorities.   Kat: Regarding social channels, it depends on the regional aspect. We have seen that the biggest communities are Twitter and Telegram. We drive people to the Discord channel and the Forum, but it depends regionally. For Latin America, Telegram might be larger. In Asia, WeChat. The ambassadors are doing more than just translation work; they are doing ambassador work so that we know where to post and where to make contact with the community we are trying to reach. Chat: Is the goal to attract diverse talent Stakeholders, Dai users, Vault users?  Kat: I think we will be able to get all of those. The content we are translating right now is more technical and aimed at people interested in participating in the MakerDAO Community Governance, with a larger goal than just holding Dai. We would like to see the number of Dai users increase, but we need our content to do that.   Artem Gordon: I have a quick question. From my personal experience, somebody will probably ask this sooner or later. Do you have any ideas, or any potential strategy, on how you might quantify or analyze the value of the translations?  Kat: Of course. We will be able to see it through our click-troughs and analytics. Also, through the community\u2019s growth, with new users signing up to the Forum and participating in the Latin American portion of it. I currently do not know how to get those analytics, but I am sure that we can and will be able to be quantified. Artem Gordon: I am currently trying to get API access to get Google Analytics on discourse. If anything, I will update you. Kat: Perfect! Thank you.    31:48  Person 1: I will mention one word of support for this. This is a baseline internationalization expansion strategy. We cannot even hope to grow in these other markets until we have the right translation infrastructure. I have worked for several companies that have expanded internationally, and this is a pretty standard first step. I am very much in support of funding this experiment. Person 2: Plus one!  Kat: Thank you, guys!   Payton Rose: One question is coming up from the Governance side. Have you thought about how you plan to implement the trial process in administering the funds and reporting how they were spent?  Kat: Yes. I am waiting on one confirmation for my multi-sig, and I will have a post that wraps everything up for that. We will have a two out of three multi-sig with specified dates and milestones to reach to ensure we are on track.    33:15  Andrew Burban: This is tangential regarding multi-sigs. As some of you might know, I have a one-on-one multi. I do not have a multi-sig. I might move my next budget to a multi-sig. After the whole fiasco with Content Production, it seems like it does not matter who is on the multi-sig. I do not know how it is done right now exactly, but I think the multi-sig should probably be, at least in part, made of other Core Unit Facilitators who keep the meaningful community separated from the actual people in the Core Unit. That is a tangential topic.  Person 3: There are a couple of things there, Andrew. On the one hand, yes, the DAO wants more security guarantees. But, on the other hand, you have a huge inefficiency if a Core Unit cannot control a multi-sig on its own. Depending on the number of transactions you have to do, if you have to rope in other Core Units every time you need to make any transaction, this will not scale. It is not viable at all. The best we can hope for is that if a Core Unit wants to run off with the money allocated, they can do that. There is not much you can do to stop it without crippling the Core Unit\u2019s ability to execute. And I think, between those two, we should err towards the not-crippling Core Unit side. What you want to protect, and this is what we can fix if there is an accident or bad blood with some member that you are not dependent on, is for the Facilitator or the members of that Core Unit to play along where other facilitators or people that Governance thinks should be on this multi-sigs could pull the funds back. That is what we are protecting ourselves from. With the former scenario, you have no hope of defending against that. Andrew Burban: What if the Core Unit has the main wallet, a multi-sig held by other coordinated facilitators, that can be accessed when necessary. Then, a secondary wallet could be held by people from the facilitator\u2019s group itself, and they can spend from that wallet as needed. But when they want to tap into larger portions of their budget\u2026 Person 4: This only works when running a budget surplus. Not when you are spending less than you expected in your budget, which should not be the case, although it is common at the moment\u2013at least for my Core Unit\u2013that we are spending significantly less than we budgeted for. But that is more a symptom of a problem than something you can rely on to create this mechanism; this multi-tier ladder of multi-sigs to get some protection. The streaming of the payments is supposed to be that you are spending what you need to spend. You are allocated what you need to spend every month. Andrew Burban: It might just be overcomplicating it. We take the risk when we hand over a Core Unit budget. We assume the money is gone. And if they run away with it, that was the risk we took. And if they do not run away with it, that is great. I was seeing the fall out of it. How can we mitigate that if the way to do it is just not voting in people like that again? Person 4: If people are budgeting appropriately, the most the Core Unit can run away with would be one or two months\u2019 worth of budget. If we are budgeting inappropriately, you get these giant surpluses within the multi-sigs. There are these lump-sum payments that a Core Unit can run off with that are substantial in terms of loss to the DAO. The way to combat this is to be more prudent when budgeting. For example, when it comes to renewals for a Core Unit\u2019s budget, you need to ask: what did you spend last year? What changes are you trying to implement this year to justify spending more in certain areas? If you asked for a two hundred thousand legal budget, but you only ended up spending fifty thousand of that, there is no reason to ask for the same initial budget next year.    38:53  Payton Rose: I appreciate the discussion, but I want to drawback to the Ambassador Program and see if we have any other questions or comments before moving on to other topics. Chat: Is there a budget breakdown in terms of cost per session or action?  Kat: We have hourly rates for the ambassadors, and we have a budget breakdown of how that will go monthly throughout this pilot. That will be shared later today when we confirm our multi-sig.   Kat: I think we are finished with the last Ambassador Program questions. Thank you so much, guys. \u00a1Gracias!  Payton Rose: Thank you, Kat. We appreciate the presentation. As we said, that was an Active Signal on the Forum. It will be going up for polling, presumably, on Monday, as long as those implementation details are posted.     Open Discussion  Payton Rose 40:36  That was all for our planned discussion topics. We have much substance in the chat to facilitate Open Discussion, which is awesome. The first one to ask to be a part of this portion was Luca, who wanted to talk about the Real World Asset Fast-Tracking Signal. Luca: Thank you, Payton. I wanted to highlight this very quickly and open the floor for discussion.  Yesterday, there was a Signal Request, as we have seen before, to propose a fast-tracking channel for the Real-World Assets application. I want to give some context: we all want RWA to be onboarded on Maker, albeit this has never been done before. It is complex. We are talking about enormous sums without the transparency of the Smart Contracts concept we are used to. With a legal setup that is untested. This requires an incredible amount of work. On the other side, borrowers are not our friends. Borrowers have conflicting interests with their lenders. This is the nature of such a beast. Hence, this competent, sophisticated, and prudent RWA construct within Maker in the Core Units was created. Unfortunately, not all borrowers will receive positive feedback. Sometimes, these borrowers have blatantly insufficient structures or track records or other issues that the Real World Finance Core Unit needs to work on for the Community. The system is not perfect. I know there are many frustrations because things are slow, and people would like them to be faster. Despite not being there yet, things are improving massively. Providing an opportunity for unhappy borrowers\u2013potentially with political contacts\u2013to bypass Real-World Finance, any other Core Unit, or any borrowing application, is nuclear. It does not provide the community with the required information. It creates an existential threat if we are onboarding hundreds of millions without any analysis, without any counterweight within the community. The community should carefully assess who is asking for this type of back-channels and willing to use them. Because, on the other side, another counterpart is very happy\u2013although it is heavy-lifting, and they have conflicting interests\u2013to labor with us in doing this workout. I believe Real-World Finance, as well as myself\u2013I\u2019m incubating a lending oversight Core Unit\u2013, have made mistakes in being not public enough with the heavy work we are doing. We will amend it. We will be much more open, and we will create office hours so anybody can chip in. Distrust people who want to project the image that doing this is easy because it is not. I leave it to you, guys. Thanks for these couple of minutes.    43:54  Prose11: It was GovAlpha that put up this signal. We try to be clear that we were not endorsing the option, but instead trying to facilitate many people asking why there is no quicker governance process for this? The answer was because no one had proposed it yet. We took the opportunity to ask the community if they think a faster process should exist. Whatever the community agrees to do will follow us as governance here.  Unknown Speaker: I want to complement what you and Luca just said. This issue with signal requests is we have been spending a significant amount of time working with contract parties. We have a bit more work with not neglecting the transparency and communications in the form. We have spent a lot of time working with contract parties and sought to be as gentlemanly as possible. We are doing okay in the professionalization of flutter. As we are giving many opportunities to contract parties, I should point out the associated risks so we can find workable agreements for possible mitigations. We have had this approach with both external and internal Core Units that we work with. In private, I have expressed the vital issue that I found with the signal request. Now I shall express it in public. While we have taken a goodwill approach to the contract parties, they did not reciprocate when the signature press was discussed. Honestly, the signal request was not even discussed before its submission into a call to action. This caused this so much disappointment with the signal request. I understand that you all have the role in facilitating the discussions that bubble up to you. That is part of the process. However, in terms of normal adult interaction, not having the professionalism of engagement is simply out of this world. I have expressed this before in the community. I have four-year kids, and this is like a kindergarten on steroids. The fact that borrowers can self-deal is an extremely dangerous prospect. I am not advocating for bottlenecks in the system or restraining particular Core Units. However, no interaction and oversight on a protocol are a nuclear bomb waiting to happen. This is not only for real-world assets but also for all protocols. I would encourage action risk professionals with professional integrity to thoroughly examine this topic. This is about the DAI and MKR that you hold. I would leave the protocol tomorrow with it was fully self-dealing with no oversight going forward. This is serious. This is not about bottlenecking Core Units. I am making deliberate efforts to scale the number and professionally acquire the number of Core Units. I encourage people to do that, but having zero relationships between borrowers and lenders oversite is a nuclear bomb.   Prose11: The only part I wanted to comment on was to issue an apology for not warning for Real-World Finance. Long addressed that on one of the posts on the thread. However, we wanted the discussion to take place publicly. While we agree we did not execute this ideally, its benefit caused public discussion. This gave us a lot of feedback, and many people felt the process was opaque. People felt the discussion was not taking place as publicly as shared. I wanted to add some caveat with the [perhaps poor] apology. I appreciate you.  49:50  Unknown Speaker: Although I have been involved for a little while, I only properly handled facilitation with the possibility of deploying budget for the choices of the Core Unit in one month. I had overseen one of the worst transition processes that the DAO probably has ever witnessed in terms of handover. I was there for that operation for about a month. I am not rejecting the fact that communication needs to be improved. The initial focus was getting the teams in place to set the mod partially for its professionalization. I have not communicated enough on the forums, but I am putting money in place for the action plan to share more proactively and regularly with the farms. This ensures that the process is transparent, and the people have access to our actions and monitors in that space. We have not stopped working for the whole month. I have delivered efforts in ensuring that we were not working in isolation. We are collaborating and building bridges with different teams in the DAO. Those teams are aware of our actions because we have coordination sessions and workshops with them weekly. The units are fully engaged. To clarify, the team comprises two risk professionals, one lawyer, and me working on the incubator programs. Currently, the Lending Oversight CU has assisted a lot in ensuring our processes. This is not entirely an off-market process, but it helps with that professionalization. But anyway, I am not saying that our communication has been perfect in any way. Improving this communication is my priority for the month ahead.  53:14  Justin: This is a discussion between Governance and Real-World Assets, so I had to let everyone get what they had to say off their chest. I want to zoom out and take a larger view. I can see the frustration generated by this request. However, we also need better to respect the different Core Units and their competency. I realized that these things are trading at a timescale that seems very slow for crypto natives. But that is because we are on the finance frontier trying to do something that has never been done before. We are also trying to do so in an organizational forum that is very novel. These combined factors create a negation challenge that causes things to take even more time than they might otherwise do. Simultaneously, I agree with Luca because you must be extremely careful in your approach. The whole protocol survives on trust. If we lose that competence and confidence, we no longer have the protocol. We cannot afford to have real-world assets blow up in our faces. We are better off not having real-world assets than those that fail. We should be cautious in approaching the subject matter and take baby steps to ensure that everything holds together before taking the next one. If a borrowing application is brought before the vote that Real World Finance has not yet reviewed, I do not see a scenario where I will favor such a proposal. Suppose I see a borrower unwilling to interact with Real-World Finance, which immediately makes me question their motives. If they are the most professional counterparty with everything perfectly laid out, maybe all Real-World Finance must do is review and approve the proposal without talking to the counterparty. But unless Real-World Finance approves, I can see myself voting in favor of it.  56:17  MakerMan: I will try to keep this short. I hear you saying that we are like a bunch of five-year-old children. I have dealt with many DAOS and calls; I would like to reduce the inflammatory language. Nuclear seems a bit inflammatory. The real issue here is our players who would like some word as to a reasonable timeline for a first agreement. Yet nobody has anything, and people would push forward on stuff. I understand that Real World Finance is changing. From a budgetary perspective, people are looking for clarity on how long and how much money it takes to give one tangible agreement that we can move forward on? This is the real issue. This poll came about because of pushback from people who want to work with Maker but feel stuck. We are not giving them any clarity on any account of a timeline. Everyone is on hold, situated, and trying to navigate positions. We are spending a lot of money and not finding a lot of traction. I think it is apparent that Real World Finance needs to put forward some clarity that we can get behind. I agree that it is not suitable for the protocol to move forward on agreements that we cannot characterize rampantly. We need not just one legal team but a couple of different groups to give careful attention to gatekeeping. This includes how they come in, are accelerated, who lets them come in, and how we reject them. That requires time, but we need to clarify how we move forward.  58:32  Luca: We are bad at communication. Please, we need to improve, and we have taken the point. However, this is incorrect. I have been overseeing the Real-World Finance team for one month, which is nothing. Within one month, pretty much all their counterparties have engaged in improving unsatisfactory legal structures that will not give any right as a borrower at Maker. Simultaneously, we have provided a detailed overview of the requests of monetarists in this case. I am calling the names, as requested. We have allowed them to amend the proposal with those reviews because they have published any specific proposal. Henceforth, we have not published our review because we wanted as gentlemen to allow the borrower to reply. The borrower has not replied for a month. He stalled the process and worked with Governance. This is bad faith. Although we will try to remain gentlemen, we will change because gentlemen are not welcomed in the house. We will publish every assessment without allowing the counterparty to remedy it. This is unprofessional, but we will do it because otherwise, we have no protection against ourselves. We shared the analysis of monetarists with them, and they have not replied. The monetarist can decide to go through a standard process, disregarding our view and endorsement. As we are not gatekeepers, they are free to do so. However, monetarists cannot say they have been waiting for an answer given them a month ago. That is like a borrower asking for a million dollars without substantiated facts based on risk management. Since the risk management opinion is negative, lobbyists take over the board of directors for a direct relationship with the committee overseeing any internal controls. I will walk away from this protocol and sell every DAI I have if a million dollars are given without any internal checks and balances because that is insane. I do not want anybody to say they have been hanging or waiting because this team has provided opinions for months. We are not forced to give any constructive opinion to people we believe do not have the requirements. This is why we are here. We are here to protect the protocol and help it grow. It will be much easier for me to give away money to random people, professional or not than be here in six months because Maker burn said we had delivered $1 billion. I will make clear this important point of falsity. We have been gentlemen, and we will change our approach by publishing everything. Now ask yourselves, what kind of borrowers are not deciding to engage and ask for direct relationships with Governance bypassing everything? What type of borrowers are they? I am not making money on this job. I am dedicating time to subpar compensation because I love this protocol. I will walk away and sell every DAI because I can guarantee that if we give hundreds of millions like this, this protocol will not live a long life. Instead of being Maker, it will be another copycat of Mint, Tyme, or Wonderland. Now pick your battles. We are doing our jobs. It is time-consuming as we cannot even engage with top counterparties. We have spent all the time protecting our backs politically against these types of movements. This is unacceptable. Now the rest is with you. I want to make sure that everything is clear. From today, we will publish all the opinions shared with our counterparties before.  1:03:20  Prose11: In a DAO, people can always propose things through MIPs or other structures to voice their proposals to a vote of MKR holders. From Governance, our main concern is that if the information is not publicly available, then MKR holders are inherently making uninformed decisions. So, that is the push for transparency. It is not for people to be mean and start trashing people on the forum. Instead, if people seek a vote (in which there are many avenues), MKR holders need to know what the people they elected professionally think about the manner.  1:04:10  Will: In the diligence process, you do not necessarily have a single assessment but instead have several stages that can happen in an assessment. For example, monetarists pointed out several critical risk issues in many DAOs. We recommend certain mitigants to be worked through. We got back in response to the blunt rejection of single-issue pointed out the assessment. They had access to double opinions that came to a similar conclusion. This is not simply a case of he says, she says. We are talking about people that worked in the credit arena for 25-30 years. On the other side of the equation, people have all experiences, but not everything is like that. Regarding the relationships, we talked to professionals in the industry with like for like marketing experience. The counterparty expressed a desire to inquire about which professional firms in that jurisdiction would like to get in that market. That was how we formed the logic of the opinion. We are not doing something entirely out of whack. As Luca said, we expressed these concerns a month ago. And since then, there has been no interaction. The counterparty has spent the whole month in the forum asking when you will originate half a billion dollars in assets. However, it would help if you spent some time working rather than in the forums. Otherwise, it will be hard to originate half a billion dollars like that. I find this quite concerning. However, we have been making every effort to be gentlemanly and operate, knowing there are multiple stages in a due diligence process. The risk assessment cannot be the sole entity because there is no back and forth communication. That is not how the process works. I just wanted to clarify that we will improve the documentation, so any data holders know the facts.   Open Discussion 1:09:06  David Utrobin: I want to echo this idea of the borrower versus the lender side of any of these deals. This is why high-quality control and compliance throughout is essential. It is not the same as an on-chain asset where you have immediate recourse. You approve unsecured loans if you do not have a high caliber of diligence in each deal. I hear a bit of impatience in the forums; we want things to happen very fast. I will be the first to say that I cannot wait for billions of dollars to be sourced from real-world assets. If Maker survives long term, it must source at the highest level to attract the largest market participants and a world leader. If we do not, we will attract all the garbage collateral. We will implode, die, and be another story in history.  1:10:49  Andrew Burban: This is unrelated to anything on the topic, but a person whose name I do not remember brought up many things. He asked me about the ESM attack and whether we should lower or raise the amount of Maker in the ESM. In the emergency shutdown model, 100,000 Maker must be locked up and burned to shut down the Maker system. The question was: can someone in principle borrow and buy up that much to shut down Maker while simultaneously opening a short? That would be profitable. So then, can someone maliciously exploit that by burning their own 100,000 Maker to shut down the system and profit by shorting Maker on centralized exchanges? His analysis said that the market buying that much Maker would bump the price up 17%. I think it would probably be more. I investigated loosely on liquidity on centralized exchanges, but nothing anything unchained. It looks like an attacker would borrow around 50,000 \u2013 55,000 Maker between Aave and compound. This puts his collateral at risk to borrow that amount. If they are borrowing 50,000, Maker, let us say $100 million, they might pick up $150 to $200 million of their collateral. Then, if they get a market price, they would have to buy up another 100,000 Maker on the market. That is another 100 million dollars at the current market price. To even initiate the attack, they will need to commit 100 million-plus of collateral, almost $300 million. They then must burn by shutting down the Maker system. To make a profit, they need to simultaneously short more than 100,000 Maker as it drops 70-90%. And then you can make a profit. The upfront capital requirement on order is close to half a billion dollars even to execute the attack. Maker\u2019s liquidity is so thin across the board that someone cannot short that kind of volume on Maker and make profits that exceed the upfront costs to execute the attack. There is one place they could do something using synthetic leverage on trade gains, but they put a cap of 900% on any position. So, let us say you do a 150 short on Maker. Their current maximum bet is $75,000 with a 900% gain. You would not be able to recoup your upfront capital in this way. I think liquidity to short that kind of volume elsewhere is nonexistent. The only place I had not looked at synthetics, but I imagine it is also not a viable place to get that short. This question came up partly because 100,000 Maker to shut down through the ESM is relatively high. We want to lower it and reward benevolent actors who trigger it for good reasons while dissuading malicious actors from exploiting it. That attack vector is probably not viable from a financial point of view. However, someone can pull off a Joker-style attack where he burns a ton of cash just for the sake of doing it. If someone had half of billion dollars laying around and wanted to destroy the system, they could do so. They will not gain financially but may fulfill their ulterior motives. Dai would not be shut down due to volatility. I do not think it would lose its peg. It just becomes one-to-one with the collateral it backs.  Prose11: After the end of Dai, it will no longer be pegged to $1. It will be pegged to the basket underneath it. So, it will lose its peg.   Andrew Burban: Dai will lose peg, but marginally, it should be worth more than $1. It will be redeemable for the collateral backing it. This attack is not financially viable, but it will be malicious viable. The attacker would not likely not gain much but risk a lot. If he does any misstep in the attack, he risks burning all the money he put in front. The question was raised because we do not want the ESM to be 100,000 Maker. We want a bit lower. My default thought was to keep a five to ten percent buffer of all the Maker borrowable on Aave or Compound rather than 100,000 MKR. Those were my preliminary thoughts; someone might want to look at synthetics shorting. This attack is possible for a malicious actor looking at burning his cash and is genuinely for the sake of destroying Maker.  1:17:58  Prose11: People are noting that you could short other instruments. You could count on the market instability of Dai losing its peg to have other effects, potentially making different ways to profit. As far as the higher or lower, we do not necessarily want to lower it. It could be higher. We want to look into the PSM threshold setting because it can be called maliciously if it is too low. If it is too high, it cannot be called in a situation where you need it.  1:18:32  Andrew Burban: Let us say the system genuinely needs the ESM being triggered. There is a tiny incentive for anyone who has that Maker to opt to burn their Maker. You would probably get it back if it were a good burn. But if you see the whole thing is about to implode, you would instead dump your Maker rather than burn. That is the disincentive structure. Who here would burn their Maker if Dai is about to implode somehow? We could consider bonuses as an incentive to burn.  1:20:56  Andrew Burban: One last tangential thought. Some of us like QiDAO, My.Financing. Some do not like it; some do not know about it. They have a symbiotic relationship with us. They absorb a lot of Dai and do partial liquidations. They are very friendly liquidation with a lot of overhead to build, so it might not make sense for us to do that. Their liquidation system works because you have some debt, and they apply a liquidation penalty to your debt. Then, half of your debt gets liquidated as they sell the collateral to cover half your debt. Approximately 40% of your collateral is sold instead of it all. This is probably too much overhead for us to build and maybe unnecessary. However, we have one of the most vicious liquidations in the DeFi space. I do not see anything wrong with the 13% liquidation penalty. There may be something to gain by doing partial liquidations, like the Seven Siblings. Instead of liquidating their entire $600 million vault (or anyone\u2019s entire vault), you are only dealing with half. You introduce people wanting to allow themselves to get liquidated. It will put less stress on our whole liquidation system by liquidating less at a time and moving the collateral ratio up. They would not get liquidated again for a long time. Does anyone think that is a topic worth looking into?  Prose11: There are many open-source options. Anyone can develop an autonomous technique, and that is a beautiful thing.    1:23:25  David Utrobin: I have a quick question about multi-collateral Dai slave instances of it. How does the protocol upgrades itself? Is slave instance just copying the parent? Will upgrades have to be compatible across different networks and languages?  Unknown Speaker: I can answer that. The current plan is to copy MCD to get something online. MCD in and of itself can be extended in any way possible. You can see that with a new collaterals routing, crop join stuff, as well as the institutional vaults. So we can extend MCT in any which way we want. You can think of the slave instances as a duplicate of MCD at the stage.   David Utrobin: I got it. Once this version of MCD gets upgraded with, for example, rate-limiting individual vaults, a different circles buffer management system, or a new emergency shutdown module,  those slave instances must be dealt with separately as a second order.  Unknown Speaker: It depends on the module. Stuff like the shutdown is not the same. There are also differences in how the surplus and deficits are managed. The VAT can never be redeployed without some Herculean effort on layer one. So that is immutable and weak. But we can tack new features on by attaching them to the VAT  with a new type of module to get these new features. But it is not like replacing the current VAT.     Conclusion  Payton Rose 1:25:38  I am sure we sent any new listeners down a giant rabbit hole. Please reach out to us, and I am happy to give you some resources and documentation. With that said, we are past our scheduled time.  Chris: We should have an excellent little discussion session at some point. Some parts of the plan are still being written up. Everyone will get a kick out of seeing how technically feasible it will be. Everyone will end up with a good mental model of expanding the protocol. Unknown Speaker: One thing I\u2019ll add is for layer two; we can redeploy that. If there\u2019s some future upgrade, we want to tack on to it. We could do a new deployment on L2 because it is not the master instance.   Thanks, guys. I would be more than happy to help facilitate that call. Thank you, everyone, for your time and attention. We have a lot of discussions today, and I would like to continue it in the forums. That is a great place for preserving the longevity of what we discussed. We will see you same time, at the same place next week.

This is the #182 Governance and Risk meeting here at MakerDAO. My Name is Payton or Prose 11 online, and I am one of the Governance Facilitators. I am joined live by a group of awesome Maker people interested in the protocol. We are here to give a weekly update to discuss some of the things going on in governance, some of the risks that the protocol is facing, and answer any questions or concerns by the audience here joining us today. The meeting is being recorded, so try not to talk over one another. If you have questions, feel free to utilize the raise hand feature in Zoom. Then I know I should call on you. You can also drop comments in the chat, and I will be more than happy to read them out if you are unable or otherwise unwilling to hop on the mic.   Our Agenda Today:  We will start with the governance round-up go over the votes, Maker improvement proposals, and general goings-on in the forum. We have a couple of initiative updates, including the off-chain collateral management, February financials, and a resilience initiative. That resilience initiatives should be closely related to Budget management, spending growth, and all that good stuff we have listed under discussions. After getting through all that, there will be open discussions if we still have time.

Milestone 1    960\u00d7540 84.6 KB    David Utrobin: The first milestone has been broken up into per deal sub milestones. The milestone is to lead the existing deals through the due diligence pipeline that real-world finance effects. And basically, our target dates here were for the end of Q2, and the last time I brought this update to the call, the team was focusing mainly on Monetalis V1, SocGen, and 6S. The assessments have been delivered with Monetalis V1 and SocGen, and the ball is in their court. The status of that is delivered from the real-world finance side. And SocGen, I believe, is still in progress.   Christian: On the SocGen transaction precisely, in terms of what has to happen, I think two parts are happening now, which is the technical diligence. The CES team ensures that SocGen\u2019s token works and how it works within the Maker vault. An exception case for actually, still working through that issue. There were some technical differences between what SocGen had put together and the kind of standard Maker token. But in terms of the contracting itself, there are three agreements. We have been going back and forth with SocGen on two of the three; their counsel has prepared the agreements. SocGen is driving the speed at which documents get ready. It involves making sure that the agreement reflects the transaction outlined and agreed upon with SocGen. It also ensures that some of the legal issues that pop up, based on the structure that we are seeing, are adequately addressed. There was an issue that we were looking into, as to French law, the creation of the pledge, the SocGen holding the keys to its token, and what that meant for transferability of the underlying asset if there was a liquidation. We are working through those issues with the external counsel to make sure that when we put the risk assessment together, we fully understand the various nuances of the token itself and how that token interplays with the underlying agreements.   David Utrobin: That process you described with SocGen applies to every one of these efforts levels. There is a technical and a legal assessment that has to happen. It is like a volleyball match, going back and forth.   Christian: To end to a higher level concerning every single one of these transactions, each asset will be different; some will be tokenized, some will not be tokenized, some will be partially tokenized, and some will have Centrifuge. They all bring a different set of issues to the applicant from another jurisdiction. We have to address how we (as Maker) interact to integrate with the real world. It is no longer a Delaware statutory trust situation when dealing with a transaction in a jurisdiction outside of the US. Then, that involves several other issues that need to be considered both by the applicant and ourselves. That is probably one of the biggest issues I deal with: the DeFi real-world integration piece. Each one of these transactions has that.   Luca: We are doing a lot of heavy lifting that we would expect the counterparties to do themselves in the medium term. We expect them to come up with an application as ready as possible. We are onboarding because we want to do business in the most prudent way possible. We are also pushing counterparties to productize and standardize as much as possible their package on a technological and legal side, that they will come with a set of characteristics that are meet the minimum requirements in our site; that way, we do not have to reinvent the wheel all the time. That is the ambition we are having. We are trying to work for the short term because we know the community is eager to do business with real word borrowers. They are also eager to work for the long term in standardizing productizing. I think we do not want to transform Maker into an old TradeFi bank; we want to push borrowers to innovate on the technological side. Everything is running smoother, better, and safer than we were used to in the old world.   Milestone 2    960\u00d7540 71.8 KB    David Utrobin: Milestone two is to graduate the three real-world asset-related Core Units from the SES incubation program. I believe the intention is to take the existing real-world finance Core Unit, split it into three, and each has its specific scope. These are the LINC Core Unit (the Lending Incubator), the RWA legal Core Unit (the legal and transaction services Core Unit), and the LOVE Core Unit (the Lending Oversight Core Unit). Combining these CUs effectively splits up the work it takes to take an application from being submitted to being assessed to be integrated. Of course, other teams play a huge role in that. The SES incubation program has several standard steps for each Core Unit. The three of these are all in progress and are in varying stages of being put together.   Milestone 3    960\u00d7540 22.5 KB    David Utrobin: Milestone three is a revamp of the collateral onboarding pipeline for applicants. For this one, I will give it over to Monkey Irish for a brief overview.   Robert: Hello everyone. I know the title might be a bit different from what I suggest because there are multiple Core Units involved in revamping the pipeline for applicants. To give you a very quick update, this is the upcoming revisions to the collateral onboarding process, part of the MIPs that I put into the RFC process is the basis for some upcoming actions. One of them is to update all, both are on, and off-chain greenlit collateral, with an explanation of some additional guidance and parameters that we would like to see to ensure the growth and the health of any collateral that has been proposed as a MIP6. We want to give that publisher of the MIP6 a comeback opportunity and either respond to it, update their MIP6, or maybe even withdraw that. We are talking about some very basic parameters. How much Dai can be generated? Is there liquidity in the market for this particular instrument? Are we working with key stakeholders in the community to ensure the parameters? Nikola is working on the parameters inside the CES group to ensure we have plenty of feedback from the CU before we go into the forums and post that. We are talking about the April time frame to do this because it will generate a lot of activity and chatter in the forums. We just want to be very careful that we have the necessary CUs lined up to be able to answer questions. And as part of that, to tack on to something that I think Luca was talking about, I would also put another action to set expectations and clarity on what is possible today, as it relates to the proposals that are being made for real-world assets onboarding. We do have tech today. I want to make sure that we are clear in the community the mechanisms that we have available to us. We would love to see some proposed mechanisms in the future, but some work needs to be done before we get there. Again, there are realities and expectations that we just want to set to let everyone know if we decide to onboard a piece of collateral, the process by which we would do that today.   Milestone 4-5    960\u00d7540 21 KB   960\u00d7540 21.4 KB    David Utrobin: Milestone four and five are both very similar. One is to Lead Maple Finance through an ongoing legal R&D project and similarly Lead Centrifuge through an ongoing legal framework R&D project.   Christian: We have just gotten started on the Maple Finance one and Centrifuge; we have made a little more progress. I think Centrifuge posted something recently. We are now just discussing the agreement\u2014and just trying to make sure that the points that the community raised in the past concerning Centrifuge and its improvements to the overall structure of their transaction are being addressed.   Milestone 6    960\u00d7540 19 KB    David Utrobin: Milestone six is to publish an ALM asset-liability management legal research report.   Christian: This one is trying to find the first time to bring on new assets to replace the USDC. Again, the real-world DeFi touchpoint is locked right now. We are just looking for various keys to unlock that. We are having discussions with various people. Frankly, the more conversations we have with people, the better understanding we have of counterparties issues, and I feel more confident that we will find that key. Still, as Luca would say, it is the first time that has ever been done, so it is not something that you can necessarily rush into. We want to make sure that it is done right.   Milestone 7    960\u00d7540 22.6 KB   David Utrobin: Milestone seven is to update the existing greenlit off-chain, MIP6 collateral applications with the status update, which Robert already alluded to. It is part of our milestone three throughout the overall process. Milestone seven is to provide an answer to all the existing applications that are waiting to hear back. That is about it for the collateral management off-chain. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve our brevity or the level of depth you would like us to cover for any of these, please let us know.   February Financials  Aes 35:02  MKR Strategic Finance Core Unit Overview1039\u00d7719 177 KB   Overview of Monthly Results I1040\u00d7720 113 KB   Before talking through the Cash Burn Analysis, we will cover the financials.  In February, the protocol revenue decreased by 75% compared to the prior month, driven by nearly a 100% reduction in liquidation income. Our net interest income was down 34% compared to the prior month. Workforce and Oracle Gas expenses were down 17% and 60%, respectively. Note that the workforce expenses reflected on-chain flows might not reflect the actual cash burn. Please reference the expense reports posted on the Forum to find this information. Recurring income was down 38%, and lending markets continued to take a beating through mid-March. We started to see signs of life the past few days in collateral prices. Hopefully, this trend will continue.     Overview of Monthly Results II1040\u00d7719 94.9 KB   Here is a waterfall chart breaking out the month-over-month change in recurring net protocol income.  As we all know, risk-weighted assets have continued to unwind for several months. Yields have decreased as well. We have taken a significant hit to the bottom line. Lower workforce and Oracle expenses are not enough to offset the large decreases in the change in assets and yield.     Overview of the ETH Market Share1039\u00d7720 161 KB    I would like to address the ETH Lending Market Share on level one.  This chart shows the past six months of the ETH Lending Market. As you can see, we have been essentially in a bear market since October. Compared to last month, ETH lending markets retracted 6%, and we are down 14% from November, with Maker losing 13% of the share from January and 15% from November. We are trying to dig into these numbers to better understand where this ETH is going. Whether it is into staked ETH, as we\u2019ve recently opened those wallets, and so has Aave for deposits, or if it is users unwinding due to bearish crypto market conditions.    Next, I would like to introduce you to Adrian, also known as adcv on the Forums. He will be presenting a cash flow analysis and opening up a discussion around budgeting, given the recent Forum activity.  Adrian recently joined the Strategic Finance Team as a CEO and General Manager and M&A Investment Banking at Goldman Sachs.     Adrian 37:50  Hello everyone. I am pleased to come on board, and I look forward to meeting you all. I am sorry to jump in with a grim subject like MIP budgeting, but I have to start somewhere.   Forum Activity1040\u00d7720 357 KB   We want to highlight the conversation that has been happening in some of the Forum posts.  There has been plenty of frustration with the lack of clarity in how we accept the budgets and the processes involved in doing so. Particularly the frequency with which they arise on the Forum; they are sporadic and try to fit the Governance windows. It can be overwhelming for MKR Holders and Delegates to evaluate this diligently. As a result, we have decided to do some back-of-the-envelope simulations, and we wanted to show you the results and conclusions.     Overview of Cash Burn Sensitivity - Profit and Loss Statement1039\u00d7719 127 KB   On this slide, we show a simplified P&L focusing only on recurring items, excluding liquidation and training.  From top to bottom, we start with assets. Net Portfolio Yield brings us to revenue, excluding liquidations and trading fees. Then, Core Unit Operating Expenses and Oracle gas to get the recurring Net Protocol Cash Flow. The line below the yellow row shows what this would look like if we approved 100% of the proposed new Core Unit expenses. Lastly, we present a hypothetical increase in Core Unit expenses related to customer acquisitions. This is something in which some of our competitors engage, but Maker does not. However, it may engage in the future. From left to right, we have illustrated various scenarios\u2013ranging from bull to super bear\u2013and the impact these might have on the protocol cash flow. These show the size of the asset exposure relative to today. We are assuming long-term yield comparison as competition intensifies, and we believe that 2% Net Portfolio Yield will decline across each of the increasements, with no scenario in which they will trend back up. We presume Oracle gas scales with the size of the assets in the protocol, which may or may not be completely true, but we have tried to come up with a heuristic, and in any case, gas is not one of the main cost-drivers.   I would like to focus on a few takeaways from this slide.  Firstly, our operating environment is highly volatile. That is very likely to appear in any of these scenarios; it is still early in the adoption group and in a stage where things move in fits and starts, rather than continuously pumping an s-curve style of growth. Secondly, we also want to highlight the impact of ongoing operating expenses on the profitability and sustainability of the protocol. The key message here is that adding operating costs makes cash flow more sensitive to environmental changes. Sebastien is noting that we excluded stock-based compensations in a very start-up fashion. Maker expenses are not in this table, but they would come on top.   There are two distinctly different types of risks we would like people to take away from this slide regarding the exposure that our protocol faces.  The first one is being caught off-guard with high operating expenses, yielding little business results when conditions deteriorate. The second one is the opposite: being caught off-guard with low investments in growth in an environment where the market is pumping and then lagging behind our competitors and losing share. We summarize these two risks as insolvency\u2013which has happened once before to Maker\u2013. There is also the risk of being flipped by a competitor with an income and position against which Maker should be defended and invested.   With this context in mind, we want to loop back to some of the concerns that members of the community have raised regarding how we manage operating and expense budgets for Core Units; bearing in mind that we want to be flexible enough to mitigate both of the risks: under-spending and over-spending.  42:53  Overview of Implications and Next Steps1040\u00d7720 180 KB   We would like to go over some of the risks we mentioned earlier\u2013insolvency and flippening\u2013, and the problems we face in terms of positioning the protocol to mitigate them.  With insolvency, it appears that the budgeting process is broad and lacks structure. Budgets can be proposed haphazardly at any time and for any amount, without considering overall DAO expenses or how that Core Unit might have performed in the past, or whether that specific activity is a crucial need for the protocol moment. Once approved, Core Units have no formal expense reporting requirement. At least not in a standardized way. Therefore, the DAO has minimal visibility on how its funds are spent. There is no formal accountability. It is easier to onboard than offboard, as seen with the MakerDAO Shop.   To resolve this, we would like to propose budgeting principles that aim to do two things:  First, helping Core Units remove cognitive overhead when it comes to managing reports. We want CUs to focus on Maker, being a DAO, and their roles as CUs. Thus, minimizing the amount of time spent on paperwork. Second\u2013and most important\u2013, equipping MKR Holders and Delegates with the best and most timely operating plans and financial information to make decisions.   Both of these principles are focused on another set of four main ones:  Each Core Unit investment should drive new revenues and/or help support the business effectively. In the absence of vowel objectives, or an executive team that can coherently set this direction, an easy way of testing this principle for each investment is asking the questions: are we adding, at least, the amount of revenue that the expenses are increasing? How does this investment support operational efficiency, growth, or user satisfaction? Dollar thresholds are used to measure the impact of the change in the budget. A little financial transparency is better than nothing, and more is better than a little. We would like to encourage all the Core Units to be as transparent as possible, as it is already part of the Maker culture. Flexibility to respond to changing macro environments. These two key risks move in either direction. The protocol and CUs need to be prepared to react in an agile way to both scenarios. We want CUs to think 5%, 10%, 20%. What is the minimum that you need to get the job done? What would you need extra in case the market turns? How much can you scale back the expenses in the event of a super bear scenario?   To summarize, we are aiming to:  First, DAO-wide organizational goals that support the strategic focus areas. There is a general sense of overall motivation and direction. Nevertheless, there are still numerous conversations about the lack of an on-paper strategy that everyone is striving towards in the same direction. This is probably part of the challenge of being a DAO, but having these organizational goals in mind would be helpful. Second\u2013in practical terms, this is something that we can help solve faster\u2013, a budgeting process with a more robust MIP40, with defined budgeting periods and a way to align them with these organizational goals however they might be defined. Clear, transparent, standardized, and timely financial reporting. A way to measure Core Unit performance and alignment with the mind that MKR Holders have entrusted with them.   To close out on this topic, in terms of the next steps, the Strategic Finance Team is picking up this mantra of having a bias for action. We are keen to do things, rather than doing less, in communion with the spirit of Maker mentality. We want to take advantage of this G&R call to produce a broader discussion and get preliminary ideas. Next week, we would like to submit a first draft proposal to further discuss this subject. Meanwhile, if you have any thoughts or comments, we are always available on Discord.  Will mentioned auditability. Who guards the guardians? This is the kind of discussion we wanted to stimulate in this call.   Thank you for your time. Nice to meet you. I\u2019m sorry I had to take part, as a first appearance, in this serious set of slides. I look forward to interacting with more of you in the future.  47:56  Aes: Next time we have you present, it will be about Maker numbers going up.  Adrian: It would be my pleasure. Aes: This is a tradition. When I first presented financials, the price was quite down, if I remember correctly.   Aes: Thank you, Adrian. To tie a bow on this, we know many people, Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling included, who are working on these types of initiatives already. There is plenty of collaboration going on behind the scenes.  SES presented its performance update on this call, which is also in the pipeline. I think we are moving towards a better place in terms of transparency and accountability for the entire DAO. I am excited about that future. We are trying to continually take one step at a time to keep getting better.   Payton Rose: I appreciate the presentation. I know we have not had too much time for discussion. Hopefully, we will have some at the end of the next one. Resilience does speak well about some of the things we just talked about. I will go ahead and hand it straight over to Wouter, I believe.   Resilience Improvement  Wouter 49:18  Thank you, Payton. Indeed, resilience is related to building upon what Aes and Adrian have presented.   Context: SES-specific Concerns960\u00d7540 141 KB   First, I want to set the context to why we are starting with this strategic initiative and all the discussion and budget flexibility aforementioned apply to the SES activities.  Planning the on-set for season two of our Incubation Program with changing market conditions is difficult. It is almost nine months that you need to look into the future. Given the crossroads we are at, it could go in any direction. We need strategy and structure around that to be able to fit everything in. I believe it was monkey.irish who posted on the Forum asking questions like: Is MakerDAO a start-up, or are we supposed to be an established organization? How are we funded? On the other hand, there are the checks that we want to put in place for expenses. There is a need for continued growth. What does sustainable growth look like? What will MakerDAO look like in a year? Those questions arise as well. Our current approach is flexibility and resilience. We are staying on course with what I call contingency add-ons, meaning that we are not canceling everything. That might be overreacting. We would rather keep working on the Incubation Program with support from minimum viable operations. This is in line with the consideration about what is the minimal cost with which you can operate Remaining flexible in terms of scaling parameters, we will not make any sweeping decisions about the number of Facilitator candidates or the number of Core Units that would graduate. At least not sooner than is needed. We want to support a budget-neutral scenario, which means the existing budget of the SES Incubation Program\u2013which is completely separate from our permanent team budget\u2013could carry over to the new independent CUs even when they graduate; ergo, the total is net-zero, we can do that without extra cost for the DAO.   These are SES-specific concerns related to more general worries that have appeared in the DAO.  52:44  Context: General Ongoing Concerns960\u00d7540 132 KB   Considerations on operating expenses and sustainable growth amplify the need for a broader strategy and vision in the DAO. Delegates should support this.  This has been a challenge from the start. Now that we are at this crossroads, it becomes extra important; Evaluating, approve or reject a budget dependent on strategy and vision. Subject to the scenario and the direction in which you want to go, the same budget might or might not make sense for a Core Unit.   Several projects are going on to improve these things. Nevertheless, when looking at the whole set and connecting it to the bigger picture, we believe there is an opportunity to improve our coordination mechanisms.   Vision/Strategy Roadmap960\u00d7540 93.1 KB   We already have several structures in place. We have our MIPs\u201339, 40, and 41\u2013that define the Core Unit framework. We have strategic initiatives as another element to coordinate and bring structure to the DAO.  These initiatives contain the fundamental roadmaps and OKRs to make reporting on deliverables possible.   We hope that one day, all of this will result in a broad strategy and vision that we could collaborate on with the Delegates.   Resilience Improvement Strategic Initiative I960\u00d7540 121 KB   We want to add this new strategic initiative: the Resilience Improvement Strategic Initiative.  We want to have a plan for all these different scenarios, and we want to make sure that we know how to scale our operations up and down. We believe that this additional challenge that we have put before is an opportunity to explore how we can synthesize an emergent strategy and vision with the Delegates. That should be an interesting experiment to coordinate. Several ideas have been brought up on how we can improve the issues we face. We want to make sure to bring them all together and that they fit into a broader strategy.   As Adrian mentioned before, this would be with an iterative approach, where we can combine quick action with longer-term alignment. For this initiative, contrary to existing ones, the stakeholders would not include relevant Core Unit representatives only, but interested Delegates as well.  We will be reaching out to recognized Delegates and asking them to which extent they would like to participate. In the beginning, we will be acting as the initiative Facilitators, at least until the groundwork is set.     Resilience Improvement Strategic Initiative II960\u00d7540 124 KB   We will hold regular stakeholder alignment meetings, similar to the ones we have for the other strategic initiatives. However, we will go through the entire process, from the problem description to the solution. This would be wider than what we are used to, coordination around building solutions. We will try to combine the solutions we come up with as a coherent roadmap within a coherent strategy. Since we are a decentralized organization, we will be open to the possibility that there might not be a single strategy but competing strategies. We are keen to explore this and see how we can deal with that.   Resilience Improvement Strategic Initiative III960\u00d7540 100 KB   We want to keep things as transparent as possible. There is no reason to limit transparency in any way.  We already have a Discord channel similar to the other initiatives, called #resilience-stakeholder-alignment. To ensure full transparency around the discussions, we are having, the channel will be available for all MakerDAO members. Coordination calls will be open for anyone who wants to join. These will also be recorded for people who cannot join due to, for example, time-zone incompatibility.   I believe that is all for the presentation.   Payton Rose 1:01:01  Thank you, Wouter. I am sorry that those three things we just presented took some time, but they are intricately related. We will now have an open discussion about the topics we covered and finance-related thoughts, and the general future for MakerDAO.   Discussion  Discussion960\u00d7540 49.7 KB   It would be logical to ask if there are questions or clarifications needed for any presentations.  David Utrobin: What is the timeline for redesigning MIP40, which guides the Core Unit budget proposal process? Is Strategic Finance going to lead that revision? Aes: Yes. We are working on a revision that we plan to post by next week.   Payton Rose: Back in the Finance presentation\u2013and I do not know if Mark or Adrian would be ideal to answer this\u2013you mentioned that in broader lending markets, there had been pullback. It is not just at MakerDAO. Can we go over the potential causes or reasons why we might be seeing that?  Aes: Broadly, a lot of it is due to the crypto market going down the bearish trends. The price on most crypto assets is down from Q4 2021. Most recently, due to the conflict in Ukraine, the markets have been even more skittish, and I think people are more concerned about their investment decisions. To the extent that people are leveraging assets through Maker and might be taking more conservative approaches. We are also starting to see fundamental changes in the market. L2s and side chains are picking up, as well as staked ETH. These are big trends. We see tons of staked ETH flowing to Maker, and I think that trend is likely to continue. Especially after the merge, staking proliferates to a much higher degree. We started to see a little price relief in the past few days, but I am not ready to call that a trend. Perhaps things might turn around. One thing we are looking at is segmenting customers based on their debt size. Largest vaults have brought down their exposure more relative to smaller ones. I am talking about ten million or more size vaults. We are trying to do some on-chain analysis to understand where the ETH is flowing and get to the bottom of it, but we are just in the initial stages of that research.    1:05:04  Frank Cruz: I have a question for Mark regarding how you manage the balance sheet and present it to the community. How do you account for the vesting budget and Dai, which is locked up in the auditor\u2019s wallet? How does that fit into the whole outlook in the MKR burn that you presented a few minutes ago?  Aes: We are not considering the cash balance that each Core Unit has. We are looking at the draw from any other wallets into CU operational wallets. One thing we are looking at is the actual burn, money flowing out of those operational wallets relative to the budgets that have been approved. We are underspending those budgets by a significant amount, as you have probably seen. Despite this, we need to have clarity and confidence in how that cash flow will increase. This is why we started to do these off-chain/on-chain reconciliations since we are not going through a formal accrual process. There is a buffer measured in our balance sheet. We have a surplus buffer plus the cash balance in those other wallets, which is not in the Maker protocol itself. If you look at the surplus buffer on MKR burn, it does not include those other balances, but our financial statements do.   Frank Cruz: How does a subsidiary\u2013someone like KKR or J.P. Morgan, who has a hundred different subsidiaries\u2013report their earnings when, say, J.P. Morgan\u2019s Vision Fund number two is sitting on two hundred million in cash? I am trying to understand how subsidiaries are reporting these to the public markets.  Aes: Generally, subsidiaries will consolidate into the parent company, but it depends on how much of the subsidiary the parent company owns. Sometimes there are equity investments: if it is greater than 50% ownership, it will consolidate like the pro-rata financials from that subsidiary. If it is less than that, it might account for equity investment on their balance sheet. Frank Cruz: Got it. I guess we are not looking at Core Units as subsidiaries, right? Aes: Right. I assume that funds in these auditor wallets are still technically controlled by the DAO and the protocol.   Adrian: About making sure that budget reviews will not be taken personally, we have noted on the conversation in the Forums how heated and emotional it can get.  Our diagnosis of this is precisely the absence of an objective structure framing budget proposals in the first place. It becomes harder to evaluate things objectively or even right when things are implied. Our aim with the revised MIP40 is to bring clarity and, as we mentioned earlier, remove the cognitive overhead for the person submitting the budget so that they do not have to think twice about how to write it in the first place. And so that they can ask themselves the questions: Is this driving revenue? Is this effectively supporting the business? And secondly, for MKR Holders and Delegates to evaluate this as clean, objective, and impersonal as possible.    1:09:41  MakerMan: In my post, I brought up the idea of segregating operational expenses or critical operations from growth.  Every organization I have ever been in has distinct segregation on that, and they do status updates: Am I a growth company? Do I have money? Can I grow, or am I in operations mode, trying to get to a place where I can get revenue to do something new? The point is that budgets are ultimately the centralizing constraint for an organization. That is a thing we are going to have to deal with. If you have autonomous people on autonomous CUs that are going to coordinate to do something, you might want to think about enabling them to drive revenue; and ensure their budget requirements from a particular player can be mitigated to some extent. I do not see anybody talking about that, although we are starting the process here. I think that discussion will continue. We have got several MIPs, including MIP 6s, that we have done\u2013for Strategic Finance to review and determine which ones led to revenue and its cost. Many of these did not lead to revenue, but there is a whole lot that did. Considering that information, we can determine where to focus our energy and what will be a waste of time for the DAO. At least to get the first shot at that. These are the things I am considering. In the meantime, I am figuring out how to do coordination around funding and initiatives. I see several CUs doing their initiatives\u2013that is great\u2013but they have to come back and be coordinated. We need a process to tighten that up. That is all I have.   Aes: I am eager to see a performance evaluation, KPI, and ROI, introduced in the DAO and evolving. Going back to this iteration, we are trying to move forward quickly because little is better than nothing, and more is better than little.  At a point where we have twenty Core Units and over a hundred contributors, we can start putting together some of these activities and rolling the ball. There are priorities for the DAO as a whole and plenty of things that need work, but, given the structure, I think having accountability is crucial. There is plenty of trust going out to contributors. We need to ensure that MKR Holders and their interests are reflected and accounted for. We are also in a position where markets have been bearish, cash flow has been declining. We may need to make some tough decisions. If we do not have any process to help facilitate decision-making, it will be messy.    1:13:53  Tim: I will chime in, but it would just sound like echoing. Mainly, I like the idea of not only tying everything to P&L because that would give us a granular focus that will be tied to market sentiment.  To Wouter\u2019s point on the Forum, I think we need room to take bets and experiment on things. If we do not iterate towards the future we want, what is the point? My main contribution, I would say, is to let Core Units that may not be able to tie back to profits start to think about how their initiatives are driving value and think more holistically. David Utrobin: That is something that my Core Unit, Governance Communications, struggles with a lot to defend because we do not drive revenues directly. Our impact is more on the stakeholder/user experience side of things. Not just how things get tracked at MakerDAO and how CUs work together on various initiatives, but also how external stakeholders\u2013just investors\u2013can have access to the happenings of MakerDAO: What kind of reports are we putting out? Where do we put them out? It is indirect. We do not drive revenue, but we believe ourselves to be very impactful for the day-to-day business operations. We set KPIs for the team as a whole, our team members, and even our programs. But this is something that is not as easily quantifiable. We see it more as a qualitative matter. Nevertheless, this is something that we are certainly thinking about. Artem Gordon: I will quickly add a comment on David\u2019s point. Overall, yes, it is true. There are very negligible ways to get a little bit of revenue through publications, but it will not be much. It is something I have been looking into.   Wouter: I wanted to add to what Tim was saying. It is especially difficult to make calls about budgets and the usefulness of a particular Core Unit if they are not directly driving revenue. If they are, it is an easy decision. You immediately get more by voting them in. If it is a supporting Core Unit or a Core Unit that is valuable in another way, you need a strategy and a vision to fit that in.  That is where the CUs that are cost leaders, in certain strategies and visions, might make sense, whereas, in other scenarios, they might not. With the new Strategic Initiative, we hope we can help figure out that connection to formulate that emergent strategy we discussed and make it possible to base decisions on that. Numbers and ROIs are not enough. Some things are long-term, some things make sense when following a certain strategy and a vision. We need to be able to express those things as well.     Open Discussion 1:18:15  Aes: I want to put some closing thoughts on this ROI versus non-ROI support versus revenue-generating Core Units.  One thing that we do not discuss enough is the perspective of the Vault users; the customers of the protocol, the people driving the revenue, the cash flow, everything. We need to focus a lot more on that perspective\u2013purely like a product perspective\u2013and get growth from those customers. Sometimes we spend our time talking about other things that can add value, do not add value, and do not cost money. One important thing is: does Amazon invest in the supply chain because it makes them money? It does not make their money directly, but their supply chain has become a model. How efficient are they shipping packages all over the world, and why?: Because customers love free and fast shipping. If we make investments that make the customer/user experience better, that will create value. Even if it is not someone from Growth finding an institutional client, people are naturally drawn to the protocol because it is a purer product than what is on the market. We need to have a stronger focus on that area. I am not exactly sure about what metrics we can use to track that at this time, but this is something I would like us to think about more. Wouter: That is a good example. The decision is to build that model. When you start building it, you cannot be sure that it will work. You can calculate the hypothetical ROI, but still, there are many things that Maker could do that might be profitable in the future. We do not want to do all these things, so which ones will you do and which things will you not? You need strategy and vision to determine what is in scope and what is not. I think that very well illustrates the problem.   Payton Rose: Awesome. I appreciate all the points in the Chat. I want to thank you all for staying engaged.  I have seen many comments like \u201cwe should try this\u201d or \u201cwe should do this.\u201d It is probably a good time to remind you that this is a DAO: if there is something you see that you think would be beneficial, you can do it. We encourage you to take ownership, post things transparently, and engage with the community. I appreciate everyone on the call. We are wrapping up. This is the last chance to hear your comments and questions.   David Utrobin: Another subject that we have not touched on in this conversation, but Sam and that group that posted their strategy for aggressive growth touched upon, is a capital raise. They are proposing Maker should consider this.  Typically, people think that the only way Maker can raise capital is by selling MKR or increasing revenues, but Sam makes an excellent point: we can do so with debt. And not only that but there are also more innovative mechanisms that we could build into a capital raise\u2014for example, raising debt/capital from customers\u2013like Vault users and Dai users\u2013and giving them special privileges in the process. Beyond just having capital as a result of revenues, I think stakeholders should consider this idea of a capital raise.     Conclusion  Payton Rose 1:22:54  We seem to be naturally winding down. I am unsure if that is due to the time or people running out of things to say, but I appreciate the conversation. Special thanks to everyone who presented today. As usual, we will be back same place, same time, next week. Thank you, everyone, for joining.

Legal Disclaimer960\u00d7540 56.5 KB   Before beginning the report, there is just a brief legal disclaimer. It does not constitute financial investment, legal regulatory, or tax advice.   Monthly results960\u00d7540 50.6 KB   The protocol had its most profitable month ever. It had about 26 million in net protocol income, driven by the record liquidation income of a little over 18 million Dai. The net interest income decreased 15% over the month. The tightening financial conditions and overall bear markets caused it. The workforce expenses increased roughly two percent from last month and should continue to grow in the next few months with the onboarding of the new strategic finance and technology operations CU. Due to cash accounting, Dai dispersed to cover the foundation-funded Oracle expenses will not be reflected until it is spent; therefore, the money is held in equity within the operating reserves.   Monthly Income Statement960\u00d7540 27.5 KB   The visual representation of the income statement, the protocol revenue, and income show a bit of strength, but a massive liquidation income is not expected to keep recurring. The interest income has remained very strong, and the expense is stabilizing. However, the Oracle expenses for gas increase considerably on the expense side due to the recent increase in the ETH price.   Lending business960\u00d7540 55.5 KB   The last month\u2019s lending income was $10 million, as they decreased by 15% from the prior month. Our ETH dependency continues to trend lower as more WBTC collateral is onboarding. As these map assets mature, they will become less correlated over time. Ramping up the real-world assets initiative will provide tremendous resiliency and diversification benefits to protocol income, which should reward the protocol with the higher multiple of earnings in the longer term.   Risk960\u00d7540 54.1 KB   The risk metrics improved over last month due to the rapid inflows of USDC into the PSM, people unwinding their risk-weighted assets, and the decrease of collateral values. The CET1 ratio increased by 65 basis points. The Liquidity Ratio is near 59%. The Dai supply is backed by 62.5% stablecoins, reaching a 10 billion Dai milestone. These inflows have sparked multiple proposals for how we can start using the stablecoins to the advantage of the protocol by investing them in highly liquid and senior credit instruments; nearly 6 billion in stablecoins would generate 30 million in protocol earnings. This yield is relatively safe.   MKR Valuation960\u00d7540 46 KB   Recurring earning yields remain high, suggesting markets are still cautious.

Team-Led Discussion  Prose11 25:00  This brings us to our discussion segments. As we mentioned earlier, we will kick it off to continue the liquidity discussion. Now that we have LongForWisedom\u2019s posts about approaching liquidation and the set of decisions, this may hopefully add some framework. Are you comfortable with giving us an intro, LongForWisdom?The real-world assets keep going up.  26:19 LongforWisedom  Yeah, I can do that. This is a write-up of what we discussed in the Governance & Risk Call last week. If we want to do something with liquidity, we need to locate our funding source. We need to do this for basically anything except Maker-Dai pairs. Maker-Dai is a particular case.  Prose11 26:58  It lays out the framework for three separate discussions, the first being what to do with the funding. This is where we should start today.  David Utrobin  27:14  I took the three decisions, laying them out there: funding source, strategy conversation, and tactics compensation.  Prose11  27:27    Excellent. As Long alluded to in the post, there are several different ways to get funding. However, some methods may not be palpable to some Maker holders, depending on their core beliefs for the Maker Oracle. We can print Dai and MKR, but this printing would essentially be unbacked. The amount in it caps our surplus buffer. This is also where we pull expenses from. We could raise funds, do something like bonds, or use other items in the protocol treasury. We have the ENS tokens accumulating staked Aaave from our D3M implementation. But the rub with all of these options is the amount of capital available to us without minting is not a lot.  David Utrobin 28:42  I have a question. What is a meaningful amount of liquidity for a given LP position? There is a signal request of up to 20 million in liquidity for the UNI-V2 position. That would take 10 million from the surplus buffer and then pair it with 10 million worth of MKR from the treasury. What is a healthy amount of liquidity to provide the market both on L1 and then as well for the bootstrapping L2 Dai markets?  LongForWisdom 29:24  I mentioned it briefly and said the answer would depend on what venue or method you use. UNI-V2 is less capital efficient than UNI-V3 can potentially be, depending on the range. In terms of how accessible liquidity is, that is important and depends on what platform you are using.  David Utrobin 29:45  Is there a target for slippage versus the size of the trade ratio? I am curious about a healthy barometer.  LongForWisdom 29:57  Yeah, there should be. I am not experienced enough to say what it should be. Maybe something Chris could chime in on?  Prose11 30:18  Monet-supply has a good point in the chat; you can set your levels. So if you were to purchase 1% of a pool, you experience X percent slippage, and try to set that within abound. One question I have in terms of whatever funding strategy we choose, how big of an issue is the liquidity problem? Is this a massive problem we are trying to solve? And in which case, maybe some of the less palatable solutions may make more sense. But if it is a minor problem, you would not start with the extreme measures for solving it.  LongForWisdom  31:19  I can summarize the objectives I have heard previously. Then, we can discuss them if we want. One objective I listened to a couple of times is to encourage L2 adoption. For example, you would like to offer liquidity on common pairs on L2 to encourage Dai adoption on L2 versus USDC. Another one was increasing the liquidity of MKR particularly. The reasons for this are a bit fuzzy to me. However, it makes the protocol look more professional, provides more ability for people to invest, and makes the Flap and Flop mechanisms work better. Feel free to talk about why it is a great idea to do MKR liquidity. One of the potential strategies is trying to make Dai the on-chain stablecoin routing token. Currently, USDC has this by default, in that most pairs are paired against USDC. When you want to trade between two semi-arbitrary pairs, the trade often gets routed to USDC pools. Potentially Dai can be used if Dai is liquid against some of the main trading pairs. Those are the main three objectives I have heard.  Chris Mooney  33:13   One thing I did not hear mentioned in the funding strategy is using the PSMs. They are positions with some Dai against them. You can flash loan yourself, let us say a million Dai, and then get 500,000 USDC onto the PSM. Then, you sell that USDC to your desired pair to fund some LP token. We have a vault type for that LP token. This process allows you to mint the original million Dai back to pay back the flash loan at the end. At least with stable-stable pairs, we can use the PSM as a funding mechanism to do this. I do not know if people have creative ideas, but there may be a way to pair Dai against more volatile stuff with liquidations off in the long term, such that stability fees should outweigh losses and the drop of a particular pairing. However, I am unsure as I have not crunched those numbers. This is just worth exploration. If that is the case, the funding source is not infinite, but it is insanely deep. We are probably in the 5 billion range that we could use to fund Dai liquidity in the space.  LongForWisdom 34:50  Yes, stable-stable is one of the easier problems to solve in this area. As you said, it is much less dangerous to mint DAI to use it and pair against stables. We might have solutions to that in the shape of the GUNI-USDC-Dai pair. We could duplicate that for other centralized stablecoins or decentralized stablecoins.  Prose11 35:38  Those are excellent points. There is much more flexibility once we start breaking into the PSMs. I do not know why that did not occur to me. Out of curiosity, is there some interest in going through the strategy or tactics conversation as well? We do not have to stick to this discussion if people feel we covered this subject last week. That is a good point. The tactics are infinite and complex.  David Utrobin  36:24   The tactics piece\u2019s main thing was centralized versus decentralized and managed versus unmanaged. This does not necessarily need to occur in those configurations because a person could be managing a position that does not require active management. For example, this could be a V2-UNISWAP position, but they handle liquidity. But that is the whole conversation. Do we trust somebody before we set up an automated solution? Or do we hold out and try to find an automated solution with minimal management first? Psychonaut\u2019s signal request suggests this for that 20 million LP position. The tactics conversation asks how do we deploy it?  LongForWisdom 37:11  Tokamak and other protocols are popping up that offer similar things. But again, it gets pretty complicated, which is why I wanted to avoid it for now. I need to read up again.  Prose11 37:33  Paper has a good question. Can whoever thinks that we do not have enough MKR liquidity take a moment to explain why? What is currently inefficient? We could say from a governance standpoint this will be the first year we have our vesting MKR going out to contributors. That is a tax liability for many people in jurisdictions, so they probably have to sell it to fund that.  David Utrobin  38:03  That is not the first time that Maker was vested. Foundation employees also received rounds of vesting, and arguably for way more MKR than is currently on schedule to be vested.  Chris  38:16  The only thing that I would say about the Foundation is I am not sure when the tax portion of the MKR was handled or if the Foundation market sold it to recover that. It would not have had a market impact.  Prose11  38:53  Well, to my point, David is putting out the obvious. As Chris mentions, MKR vesting and distribution did not keep the taxable portion during the Foundation days. This caused the like market song. Whereas if we are distributing to many contributors, there is a good reason that many of them will need to market sell to fund the tax burden.  David Utrobin  39:23  The implied point is that deeper liquidity gives MKR more price support/resistance when people sell their vested MKR.  Prose11 39:59  Nick, you have a good point. I do not know if you got a mic this week, but I am happy to read it out. If not.  Nick 40:09  I can answer Paper\u2019s question. It was not about where the Foundation was located for the vesting tax implications but instead about where individual employees were. All employees in taxable jurisdictions had their taxes withheld from their MKR. Now let us say there is no Foundation. Every individual who is part of the DAO will need to consider whether or not they need to sell a portion of that to cover the taxes. And that will impact the price. That is the distinction.  MakerMan 40:57  Most of the liquidity is in Maker-F. Since it is a strongly correlated pair, it is not good for liquidity and value because of impermanence loss. Any token stablecoin V2 LP will buy Maker when the price drops relative to a dollar then sell as it goes up. If you stick money in there, you are guaranteed to buy below where you stuck it in and sell above that price. The price must change by a factor of four on either side, down 75% up factor of four to access the liquidity in that contract or to get more than half of it out. The whole point of doing it with a stablecoin is to build a pricing base. As the price moves, it will DCA and keep sopping up liquidity over time. The more you stick in, the less slippage and more trading you will have. In addition, you will sop up more of the base token. It could inherently sop all the Dai if you did this with Nexio-DAI, Gnosis-DAI, and Maker-DAI. Then, you can make vaults on these because the LP token\u2019s volatility goes as the square root is the primary token. It is a better investment than trying to pair with a correlated asset like ETH or another token. Gnosis is already wanting to pair with other tokens. HoneySwap and Onehive have already done this. It stinks because you cannot make up all the liquidity with your token against everybody else\u2019s liquidity and expect price support. This just does not happen. When I looked at fees, I rode these pairs and tested them. A token of Maker-ETH will make less than a Maker-Dai should the markets work right and arb those. It is how correlated things versus anti-correlated things or non-correlated things work in these spaces. The thesis here is to build a large liquidity position when you get strong price support. Your Oracle at 30% of overall liquidity becomes the position, and everybody ARBs against it using that position. This ends up being a tangible thing if you can do it. The DAO can sell into its liquidity and raise Dai. Should you need liquidity, you can pull it out. You do not even have to sell the Maker. You pull Dai back. That is the case for doing Dai stablecoin or token stablecoin vaults. Since we are Maker, we want those to be Dai because it will lock up Dai that earning interest potentially. We can offer vaults in this LP and encourage Dai creation. I have been trying to pitch to Gnosis to take their GNO that they want to burn, figure out how to raise some cash, pair it with Dai, and us to make a Gnosis V2 vault to make Dai. We can get a Maker instance on our Gnosis chain back with their liquidity, and then we support an instance for them for borrowing. To me, it is a no-brainer. You make money and sop up your liquidity. You make liquidity and pricing support against a stablecoin and not a correlated coin, like ETH.  Kirk 44:42  That is the case for doing Dai stablecoin or token stablecoin vaults.

Justine, you are welcome to chime in yourself. We have a comment pointing out that we are worried about people selling when the burner is on. We have a big protocol buyer that can sop up a lot of the selling pressure for MKR. I know we have at least one more discussion topic to get to. So I might put in the call for last thoughts on this one.  David Utrobin 46:46  Go vote on Psychonauts signal if you have not yet.

And then, our next steps are what I described, such as starting these more open discussions with the community before moving forward with, for example, the different incubation program tracks that we are planning. And with this, wondering if there are any questions or comments.  David Utrobin 1:01:23  What Monet brought up in the chat is important. Even though SES might not want to put things up on Twitter, it will get on Twitter no matter what, as a secondary consequence of anything sensitive.  Wouter 1:01:40  Yes, I agree. Keeping the communications on internal platforms will dampen the effect a bit. But ultimately, because we are a transparent organization, it will make it to Twitter. And then, we need to make sure that we have a specific immunity against the kind of storms Twitter can create. That is where the alignment within the community is important. We need to make sure that the arguments are available to dispel the misinformation on Twitter.  Prose11 1:03:12  This will also be a chance to engage on the forum post when the postmortem goes up. Brian is saying he has AV issues; if those get solved, I can circle back to it.  Wouter 1:03:24  Somebody asked how we got Patricia as the candidate to work on this. I believe we have LayerZero on the call. And he can explain how Patricia is a banking industry refugee.  LayerZero 1:03:46  Sure. We have been talking informally with Patrice here for six or seven months. She is a compliance officer with 16 years of experience in the banking industry. Throughout all this time, she expressed her desire to quit her career in the banking industry and switch to crypto and DeFi. Since then, we have been talking to her about applying her expertise. I can attest that this person has hard skills with experience related to regulatory, specifically AML sanctions. She commits DeFi so deep that she quit her job to explore working for DeFi or MakerDAO. Ultimately, she has the expertise and commitment to the industry. That is why we selected her for conducting this research.  Wouter 1:05:02  The discussion about the incubation program tracks will be one of the follow ons. One of the program tracks is legal. First, we will try to attract additional core unit facilitator candidates who have the qualities and capacity to lead a team in a decentralized environment and align with MakerDAO\u2019s values. Second, we want them to also have relevant background and expertise on the topic. Please get in touch if anyone knows people of interest with a legal background, project management experience, and team-leading capacities. We will make sure these people are included in the selection pool.  Chris 1:06:23   I have interesting technical topics to bring up. It is not because of the KYC AML announcement, but it did make me think about this attack vector. The past weekend of cancellations around DeFi also made me consider the vulnerability of all holders to MKR holders. We created Dai, so Dai is completely permissionless censorship-resistant. It is an immutable contract that cannot be changed or censored no matter how much you disagree with it. It cannot be compelled by legal doctrines or different jurisdictions to censor it. However, this is not true for vault holders. The protocol needs to be mutable enough for us to make upgrades so that the cat or the dog (two contracts that perform liquidations) can confiscate vaults and liquidate them. These functions, like grab on the bat, and other changes like debt ceilings, make vault holders beholden to the whims of MKR holders. I do not have a great solution. The more we lock out MKR holders from performing these actions, the more we Ice Age ourselves out of the protocol. In the long run, MKR holders are likely to threaten vault holders, at least to their ability to create vaults. You can easily see a myriad of reasons why MKR holders may be pressured to censor vault holders under different jurisdictions or cultural movements. Right now, we depend on the fact that MKR is widely distributed. But even then, we have already consolidated down to just delegates. If those delegates tend to share, let us say, positions like cancel culture or a particular jurisdictional threat, then vault holders are at risk. It is worth starting to investigate, from a technical perspective, if we can have our cake and eat it too. See if we can lock MKR holders out of affecting vault holders without removing our ability to upgrade and change the protocol. I am not sure it is going to be possible. However, we should at least be prepared to lock ourselves out of making specific manipulations to the protocol in case we see such a threat on the horizon. That is one positive that came up.  Brian McMichael 1:10:00  Yeah, Wouter, your penance was exemplary. Part of the issue was this was a big surprise. It seemed to go against all of our narratives of permissionless. Then the response, \u201cit is just research,\u201d was terrible. The same day, the IRS came out and said they researched how to hack into ledgers for people. I do not know if that is a satisfactory response because the research intends to hack. This slide deck was good. We are not going to try and slip something into Dai. There is also a compliance Core Unit on the SES page in incubation. I think its purpose should be elaborated to the community. We see research for KYC AML Compliance, and then we see a compliance Core Unit coming up on the horizon. Could you explain what that means?  Wouter 1:11:15  That is a good point. It is also one that we have flagged internally. We have already changed the name. This is a completely different type of compliance. This is one of the Real World Assets CUs that would exist within the new, more decentralized structure. Checks and balances are one of the principles to create an arms-length relationship between different parties. The Real World Assets Core Unit structure would comprise three types. The Real World Asset portfolio Core Unit is probably the most familiar. This covers which would work on applications and onboarding new collateral types. The second would be legal. The third would be what we used to call the compliance Core Unit, which puts a framework in place. It plays a similar role in advising the other two Core Units: portfolio and legal. It is a check on the practices that they apply. It ensures independence and the best practices to make the protocol safer. In the traditional world, this is the role of a lending compliance unit within the business. We are using a different name now, updating the website.  MakerMan 1:13:17  I was thinking about this KYC compliance. When we talk about arm\u2019s length, is this going to land on our UIs? We own one of them, but there are many other ones. This will land where the people are initiating the transactions. Anyone can bypass that, but most people will not do that. It makes me think KYC will land hard on the user interfaces to the protocol. Maybe that is the best place to deal with this.  Wouter 1:14:04  This is a broad topic. We do not own the UI in any sense because it is not a core unit. Commercial companies provide these UIs to bring the functionality and availability of the protocol for end-users. The developers of these UIs do not control the protocol. They will need to analyze to reveal feasibility and unlock the Maker protocol\u2019s permissionless potential for their end-users. These groups can apply many potential technological improvements to make it more decentralized. An obvious one is working with IPFS or a similar mechanism. You could create a desktop application UI so that people download it. You do not run it on the server; people can just download it and use it on their computer. The service provider is not running the UI. They are simply a software developer. It is a very broad discussion, but multiple service providers should make various UIs. The service provider should focus on software development rather than providing the service of accessing the Maker protocol. Now, that is my understanding of it as definitely not a lawyer.  Unknown Speaker 1:16:24  I want to stress that decentralization is the main tool for reducing regulatory risk. We have seen regulatory agencies such as the SEC, the securities agency in the US, or the Financial Action Task Force. They have expressed that protocols that have achieved a sufficient level of decentralization could be outside their scrutiny. I want to stress that decentralization and reduction of regulatory risk go hand in hand. They are not contradictory. And by fostering one, we are fostering the other one. As we know, each centralization point is a regulatory attack vector. And part of this analysis should include which centralized point of failure we have and try to mitigate and decentralize them.  Unknown Speaker  1:18:09  We invite the whole community to have a serious constructive discussion on how to deal with this upcoming regulatory risk. There are hard problems to solve, but they are problems that we can solve as a community together.  Prose11 1:18:34  Awesome. Our primary announcement is to stay tuned for more future announcements on the forum and Discord regarding next week\u2019s meeting. There is a chance we do not host one due to ETHDenver, but we have not decided yet. Stay tuned for that. We are looking forward to ETHDenver for anyone attending. There are some good resources in our Discord for getting in touch with other Maker folks that will be around and their events. Any events that people wanted to call up before we end the call? As always, let us keep the discussions going on the forum. Thank you for joining us, and we will see you maybe next week. Thanks.

This is the Scientific Governance and Risk episode #181 at MakerDAO. My name is Payton Rose. I go by Prose11 online. I am one of the governance facilitators here, joined by many awesome Maker people who both works with the protocol and are generally interested in it. These are weekly talks about what is going on, what risks the protocol faces, and what future discussions we need to have. We do have a bit of an agenda to get through, but I will go over some housekeeping matters first. This call is being recorded, so please try not to talk over one another; if you would like to speak, you can utilize the raised hand function or drop a line in our chat. Also, I am happy to read out any questions or comments if you are unable or otherwise unwilling to hop on the mic. If you have questions or there is anything you want to contribute, please do so; we love to get as many perspectives as we can during these calls.   Our Agenda today:  We will start as usual with a brief Governance update going over the votes, the MIPs, and the Forum. Then, we will jump into some initiative updates: Layer2 and MakerDAO and some of our Twitter and social media accounts and how they are performing. And only one discussion topic: RWA Collateral After that, if there is time, we will have some Open Discussion.

That\u2019s been completed and led to a chain security audit on the DAI Bridge implementation, and that was followed up with a PoC that the StarkWare group shared with Oracle\u2019s Team earlier in Denver.   Leading onto the in progress work:  There\u2019s a technical assessment that\u2019s currently underway between PE and the StarkNet team; what we\u2019re trying to do here is akin to the collateral onboarding process, where you have collateral, it gets reviewed by Risk, by the Technical teams, and you have a disclosure discussion of these risks on the forum. We\u2019re trying to do the same thing with L2. And we\u2019re hoping to release that in the next week or so. In parallel with that, there\u2019s also an ongoing audit for events and message cancellation on StarkWare, which should be due for completion at the end of the month. There\u2019s also an ongoing discussion around circuit breaker considerations, and we\u2019ll expect to have something in the forums next week or so on that topic.    About work to do:  The outstanding tasks are wrapping up the Oracles integration, deploying the UI SDK, and integration on the front ends \u2014 the StarkWare team is working on that. It\u2019s providing them with a software development kit to integrate that. Then, there\u2019s also cross-team integration to ensure we have the forum posts and the community awareness already set up. Louis is already working on the circuit breaker piece but hasn\u2019t merged it yet.    And then on the target side,  Deliver Slow withdrawals by the end of March upon completion of audits. The dependency here is completing the audits and making sure that the events and message cancellation are all good by the auditing team. That is targeting as originally communicated.    Fast Withdrawls & DAI Wormhole  Fast Withdrawls &amp; DAI Wormhole960\u00d7540 49.8 KB    What\u2019s being delivered:  The Optimism Wormhole contracts are being developed, audited, and deployed on Kovan. The last time we gave the update, we were waiting on doing that deployment to Kovan, which has been successful. Oracles have also done a bunch of work this last month around the design document, the PoC, and the integration and addresses on the Testnet deployment, which has been great. SDK has been delivered to Optimism and Arbitrium UI teams.    In progress:  Next step is to make sure they integrate our Wormhole capabilities into their front ends. We also had a call yesterday with chain security around doing an audit of the Arbitrum Wormhole contract. The next item in progress is testing the Kovan deployment and Oracles integration to ensure that these deployments are working and functioning as they should in a Testnet environment.    The upcoming work:  The upcoming work is completing all the Kovan and Optimism and Rinkeby (Arbitrum) tests. Then, setting up comprehensive monitoring and alerting for bridge invariance. Again, this is one of those cross-team coordination tasks where we need to integrate with different teams. Finally, integrate those UI and test them out.    MCD on Layer2  MCD on Layer2960\u00d7540 47 KB    Delivered: We talked about how we take MCD from Layer1 into Layer2, map out all the different modules that exist, and understand which areas need to be researched in more detail.   In progress  We are defining the MCD module behavior for L2 We need to do some upgrades to the Solidity version to ensure it\u2019s compatible with L2 environments. And some complexity needs to be documented and discussed, especially regarding Emergency Shutdown: it\u2019s a complex module, and to understand how the way the end works and how that\u2019s going to function when there are multiple environments or domains of MCD operating needs a little bit more mapping out.    Future work:  Further investigation into MCD modules. The complexity of MCD needs to be mapped out in a Layer2 world. And also how we manage that and surplus management in an L2 environment. We need to Bootstrap a Keeper ecosystem As part of governance processes, we\u2019ll have the standard Technical and Risk team assessments that have to happen to move this forward.    Targets:  We\u2019ve got MCD on Optimism and Arbitrum, tentatively targeting Q2, but I restate their  tentative aspect here because it does depend on Wormhole, the MCD Layer2 definitions, the modules,  any changes we have to make, and any changes as a result of the Solidity upgrade that needs to be done as well. But I think that\u2019s all to be expected and it\u2019s all being tracked as part of our stakeholder alignment initiatives as we progress. MCD on StarkWare target TBD.  Pending Solidity upgrades and further understanding of the Cairo code.

Important Points:  Discord Channel to coordinate with CUs Calendar Preparation Publishing     Twitter Content960\u00d7540 46.7 KB    We create a Discord channel to coordinate with CUs.   We will share a calendar in which you can post the information you want to publish. We help you to prepare your post: if you don\u2019t have the actual tweet, we can help you with that and the graphic content if needed.   After that, we can coordinate the publishing date with you.   What things do we consider publishing?  Discussions around the future of Maker and DAI Maker community updates CUs updates Monthly updates showcasing the DAO\u2019s work MakerDAO announcements     Questions 29:56  Discussion  RWA Collateral 31:34  Will: We have got a presentation for next week that David and I are working on together. It is not there, but I can start at least with a flavor to the conversation this week. In terms of the team\u2019s work, we had a long February with a couple of assessments that occupied the vast majority of some of the team\u2019s effort. The first one was published, version one of Monetalis, in the forum. There was a negative overview of that one, and your reasoning is explicitly stated in the risks of that. I had that and have a session as well to explain to delegates. We are happy to replicate the same session with the rest of the community if they use an appetite. It is mostly a summary of the same content but with more background and flavor. The other key work for February was the review of 6 structures or successfully had expressed intention to submit an upgrade of its existing vaults, but it has not been published. That is a request, but it had been expressed. That triggered an event to have a review of that. So we started a review of that one with a legal engagement with Shearman and Sterling, and we discussed the risks that meet against the report pointed out as an output of that discussion. That is currently with Matt\u2019s team to review. And there is an attention to implementing a number of the MIPs pointed out by the law firm. I will let Christian use the call coming further if the community has gotten more updates. On the 6S, we did not have a review of the credits simply because that 6S has not moved further with the data upgrade. They will come back to us once they are ready to officially submit the request for an update of the vault.  36:49   At some point, I could speak as a party trying to onboard borrowers and dealing with our RWF CU.   Someone: That is the two key odds. We have got many other counterparts trying to draft their MIP and engage the team in the premier process. This has been confusing the community. Our pipeline is not our pipeline; it is the DAO\u2019s pipeline. They are trying to engage the community to get the best possible written MIP for delegates to have the most information before a MIP is published. There are several initiatives in that early stage. So other vehicles and their existing initiative are one of them. Max, if you want to comment on your experience, it would be useful for the community.   38:15  Christian: I want to say this before Max jumps in. There are a couple of other things that the community should be aware of that we are working on. One is that we are continuing to work on the SocGen transaction. SocGen probably has some technical issues working out jointly with Collateral Engineering Services. We are working with them to document the SocGen transaction. We have a draft loan agreement that we have commented on. Soc has come back on. We have got several other documents that we have been working on with SocGen. That is in process. The other thing that we have been working on is Centrifuge. Centrifuge has indicated a new structure. At the beginning of the year, we put together the methodology for structured finance transactions to give borrowers a sense of the type of deal structures we were looking for and the type of protections and structures that a senior secured lender would expect. I do not think anything that we have published regarding our methodology is different from what you would see a senior secured lender looking for in the real world. We were not very creative. We borrowed heavily from everything else people were doing. Centrifuge took that, then working with me, we went through a couple of different iterations of potential structures that would be flexible enough for them to use going forward. However, at the same time, we want to be responsive to some of the protections that we want to see in the documents. And let us be very clear; these are protections for Maker, not anybody else. Centrifuge took that and came back to us. Then we looked at it and said, yes, this looks like it is going in the right direction. Centrifuge then prepared the first draft of one of the agreements. I am working on going through that and providing comments to Centrifuge on that agreement.  We have also had many discussions with one of the MIP6 applicants and trying to reshape their proposal that involves the creation of security interests under local law. We looked at how that would impact their operations and give us, at the same time, the security that we were looking for. We had discussions with external local counsel in Europe to help you understand nuances of local law and perfection of security interests and local law, which is all very different. I can assure you that what is done in India and the US and the Netherlands, in the UK, Brazil, Chile, and South Africa are all very different. We have to engage with the local council to do that. We have also been working on that. I wanted to supplement that a little bit.   Will: SocGen is one of the main evaluations that are currently ongoing. It is a pleasure to provide us with all the flavor of that. The goal for SocGen was, of course, the end of it by the first quarter of 2022. I want to manage the expectations here with the community due to a few delays, particularly contractual delays on the SocGen sides. And there is also a smart contract review. There might be a few weeks of delay between the expected delivery date, which was the end of the first quarter, the end of March. It might be more towards April.  43:05  Max Glass: This is like building a road across mountains. It takes a while to build that road. But the second it gets built, we will have to flow through it. I showed up in August joined up with Greg on this RWA Company to start to help get some of our clients onboarded. My first experience was bringing this client that was doing the film finance and then getting rejected by this CU. When that happened, we went back to the drawing board. And it ended up being for the benefit of MakerDAO that rejection happened. Because what we decided to do was just let us raise the bar, let us see if we can get some higher quality counterparties. What is the highest quality counterparty? How about an American publicly traded commercial bank? And we went out and tried to find that, and I am very excited that we have got a MIP6 almost ready to go with an American publicly traded bank regulated by the FDIC and the SEC. And working with the RWF CU has been instrumental in getting that MIP6 into shape. They have been the counterparty to which we have put it up and gotten feedback and iterated. And yes, it is slow, but it is slow because this is a complex transaction. We are doing something that has never really been done before. MKR holders should understand this topic because we have an opportunity to raise the bar and set the standard and do this right. If we do it right, it will accrue enormous benefits to both Maker and DeFi. What goes into making a deal? There has to be a legal entity set up in the real world. And there have to be transaction documents. You also have to have a counterparty that understands what is going on. You have to, of course, get them through governance. These are all things that have yet to be done in full before.  Although 6S Capital is live as a model that has taught us a bit, what is Maker doing to professionalize our approach in borrower versus lender perspective and for designing a deal? Luca has tried to, and these guys at RWF CU have been tasked with finding the highest quality counterparties. Everybody involved has to seem very professional and buttoned up to interact with those regulated institutions. I see that as the culture right now. I am optimistic that this is a very professional thing. And there will be a well fleshed-out pipeline and process that anybody can come to MakerDAO as a counterparty and go through. There is no need to fast-track. What will happen is that this will perpetually get faster and faster. This is the slowest that will ever be. Let us just put it that way. It will get faster and faster as we essentially automate this thing, and we have template documents that we can reuse and plug and play. I understand the urgency. It is an enormous opportunity. Maker needs it. DeFi needs it. I am working every day to make it happen. I feel very confident. We will have some killer counterparties, phenomenal high-quality counterparties, numerous coming through the table with getting their deals done, getting them approved through governance, having a model template, legal structures that are open source. Then this thing is going to flow like building a road across mountains. We are building the road right now. But once the road is built, there will be much traffic through it.   Christian: Thank you for that, Max. The other thing that is helpful for people to know, and Max touches on it, and it may seem easy, but it is quite complicated, which is the legal and jurisdictional issues. We are looking at transactions from all around the world. The first thing I think of is a tax because ultimately, somebody, almost always the borrower, has to pay withholding tax. We need to think about it, and the borrower needs to think about how we structure that. If we are doing a deal in Brazil, there are many different considerations: Does the legal entity get paid in Brazil? How does that legal entity, pay Maker? 6S has provided a model for US deals, and I do not think it is the only model. As we see deals coming from different jurisdictions, we need to look at those jurisdictions to understand what the local law allows us to do. The Delaware statutory trust is a creature of the state of Delaware that does not exist in a lot of other jurisdictions. Even the concept of trust does not exist in many jurisdictions. Civil Law jurisdictions like France do not necessarily have a trust concept. As we look at various transactions coming to us, we need to ask all of those questions and understand the cash flow and its implications. How does the DeFi integration to the World World Peace happen? That in and of itself is complicated.  Then you have regular deal documents. The other thing I would add to professionalizing: one of the things that I have been working on is to make sure that we have law firms that are supporting the RWF team. Law firms that have transactional experience in particular subject matters. I am in the process of trying to onboard more law firms that can provide us the support for Max\u2019s deal, for instance, where you are talking about an American regulated bank. That is the Belly of the Beast right now. We want to make sure that we have the best counsel advising Maker in doing that type of transaction, so we address and know all the risks and issues. So that when we prepare the risk memorandum, it is complete, very put through, and very thoughtful. It is very much a process. And as Max said, it is building, I would even say a railroad, across mountains. Roads might be easier. Railroads are more difficult. Over time, we will develop a collection of documents that we can reuse and reuse for borrowers. We have got half a dozen different borrowers bringing eight different deals to us. There is a wide variety, and it takes time to understand those, assess them and then implement them.   Will: I am happy to complement the point that Christian and Max were making touched on it around the professionalization. One of the first discussions that I had as soon as we started, pressing a bit of a reset button into what we were doing, was a conversation with Christian. If we want to do things properly, then we have not got a segment but scale the legal path of RWA because it is a critical one. If it was probably just about collateral risk evaluation from a commercial credit perspective, things could probably be faster. Nailing on the legal path is important. One of the first actions I took was conversing with Christian, asking if we could create a supporting function that is almost separated functionally from commercial and risk. However, it can also bring them different intermediary solicitors that can help Maker have two, three, four Christians that understand the law in key jurisdictions around the globe. This can help create a panel of those law firms across the globe able to scale that function. That is currently another aspect going through the incubation of our legal terms. There was deliberate effort to be able to do it so that can support every activity from credit and commercial play in.  54:36  Max: At MakerDAO, we treat engineering seriously. Software engineering is severe. We would not say that we need to fast-track pushing this production code. This stuff is legal engineering. And we do not want to fast-track pushing anything to production because there is a tax surface area. We want to minimize that. We want to have everything tightened button up. We do not want to put a boat in the water with holes. The point is that we should understand that this is legal engineering happening. We should treat it in the same way we treat software engineering, with the same security principles. Christian: When we are engineering, safety is paramount. But we do make many sorts of risk trade-offs. We do a little bit of calculus on stuff that may not have the perfect construction. We put that out sometimes because, let us say, the probability is low that it would occur; maybe the risk of impact is high. It is usually a multi-varied equation when calculating risk. My only suggestion to you guys would be that the DAO desperately needs to deal with its PSM USDC problem, which is a type of RWA. We need to diversify that. We should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. If we can take calculated risks on certain collateral onboardings, we should make an effort to do that. I have done this on a governance call before. There is something to the mantra of asking forgiveness rather than permission.  I have noticed through many companies that I have worked for that are trying to be in complete compliance or go by the letter of letting us say what the internal legal teams suggest. Often leads to those corporations being not competitive and stagnant. If we lean too hard on the risk-averse aspect of the DAO, we are less likely to get anything done. Considering that, let us try and assess how much risk exposure we think there is. We have got a surplus buffer. MKR holders can maybe decide if they want to lose some of that surplus buffer. We certainly do this with regular collateral onboarding. There are risks when we talk about Layer2s. We tried and scope that to how much possible losses could occur in the surplus buffer before we had to dilute MKR holders. We should probably make similar assessments. If we have been working with people for a good chunk of time, 6S would be a good example I can think of. We have worked with them for years. There were many discussions in the foundation. We have done software engineering. Matt has put enormous time and money into the legal constructions. We have more trust built up over the years that we could lean on in that case. Even if maybe legal constructions are not going to be perfect, we should consider how big our risk of USDC is and do our job to try and risk-manage the collateral basket that backside. That was a lot there. I may have said a couple of dumpster fires. Apologies.   Christian: In terms of legal being a beam, perhaps the delay, I can assure you that that is not the case. I have been doing this for 25 years. I have worked on transactions in over 40 different countries. I have told anybody who wants to talk to me that I am a deal junkie. What I like to do is the deals. From my perspective, the way that I approach it is how do you get a deal done? The other thing that I would say is when I was working at a law firm in Japan, and I had first-year law students come to me and say, I want to come work in Japan and get my experience there. The first thing I would say to them is: do not go to Japan, first, start in New York, start in London, learn the basic ABCs, learn how deals should be done. Then come to Japan, Asia, the Middle East, or wherever you want, and then see how deals are done because there is flexibility outside of the basic ABCs that you learn in New York and London. There is balance. I have no doubt. But I can assure you that I am a deal junkie on my level. I like to find ways of collaborating and getting deals done. But sometimes deals do not get done because they should not get done. Because there are gaps, holes, and problems. We need to be mindful of that. The intention of setting up a legal CU is along the collaborative getting deals done, within reason, approach. That is what Maker wants. That is how Maker succeeds is by bringing on transactions. But it also succeeds by not losing money. And that also has to be balanced. Max: There are two types of risks. There is this counterparty risk and the legal structuring risk. We have been delayed on the counterparty risk because some top-notch counterparties have approached these CUs and us. We know the type of quality we can bring here. The delay has been not wanting to lead to lower quality when we have the opportunity for such high quality. Even if it takes another couple of weeks, the high quality will be worth it. For example, in sales, if you want to have $100 million of revenue, as a salesperson, you cannot do that $100,000 at a time. You want to be looking for the $10 million deals. Maker wants to be capable of deploying essentially billions of dollars. If not, an enormous amount. We want the biggest, highest quality counterparties and the fewest number to manage. This is a philosophical question for Maker. But at least from a management standpoint, we have fewer higher quality counterparties with which we can do larger business is much easier to manage than much smaller and lower quality. And we have limited bandwidth as a community. In terms of engineering, we want to focus on the biggest opportunities.  1:03:44  Katie: Is there a process for onboarding RWA? Prose11: From the governance side, up until this point, we have not had any MIPS that direct the treatment of RWA differently. This is why we have been applying our regular collateral application process to RWA, with the major difference being who issues the risk report there. The risk report is potentially much more difficult to issue as it involves going into legal structures and all the challenges they have been talking about. Anyone can propose a MIP, and Will was one of the new MIPs put up last night to put forward and guide the process slightly differently for RWA collaterals. I am not a little well learned or not. I just wanted to get the government\u2019s take there. Will: I saw a couple of comments in terms of my project. Let me know if it is not getting through. The MIP6s\u2019 application process is as the existing MIP6\u2019s application. That does not change. That entails a MIP application that any counterparty can submit and then be treated by the existing team that is in there. It does not mean that it is the only team that will be there forever. They are working diligently, and hopefully, they can dictate a little more time to also the scaling up in the longterm. And at least the beginning is with the legal partner because it is an important one. We have just realized by working for more than a year with that existing MIP6s\u2019 application process is that the understanding of the counterparties of requirements for a full-fledged MIP6 is various. You have counterparties that fully understand just by looking at the questions.  We updated these questions a few months ago on MIP6\u2019s application. Before, it was just a check boxing exercise that was to be done without understanding the context required to have transactions that were subject to market standards. The question is relevant, but the depth of how they are answered was probably not there. Through that long and painful experience, we realized that MIP6s were putting the work together and putting votes for prioritization. The existing MIP process is the green light vote; it determines the priorities when you sign to the teams. It means that the process is still as it is, but we just realized that there were shortfalls in how it works operationally. Even applicants who were getting through the process of submitting applications have been proactively engaged to the team, and we gave a little more guidance on how to structure it. And I think the very first guidance that came in this process of resetting and professionalization over the last couple of months was the MIP6 methodology for structured finance transactions found in the forum. The MIP6 process asks you to answer 15 questions, but what we mean by that is x. This is a methodology. You can put things that mimic that, making your application complete. This was not only for our team in particular. It will favor MKR token holders to make a more informed decision on what they are telling teams to prioritize versus a marketing piece with very little information on it. Once it exists, it slows down the process if it is not done to a reasonable degree. Suppose I had a key message like a MIP6 application drafted with flows and quality. It slows down the process simply because it takes just as much time or up to four times longer than the original proposal once it goes through greenlight. Once the diligence starts, they say this is what was provided as a MIP6; we must work on many details to assess it. We realized that the post in MIP6 for MIP6 did not have some guidance. They would essentially have to rework the MIP6 to get to some level of standard that we could have a view to assessing it. That is a realization. MIP6 is still and will remain forever an open process. Projects can and should go forward if they have a proposal that they really think is in line with the Maker protocol and submit it. They then must realize that when it comes to its treatment, there might be some real work done. From a borrower\u2019s perspective, this might increase their costs because they will have the potential to be doing the same thing twice.   Eric: I am on RWA. I want to make a few comments. There is a question of risk appetite and standards for Maker. On the one hand, you could say there is a great investment. It is venture equity; this is an Ex-Google; you think we will make a good return. But the other issue in Maker is that we need to back Dai with very stable investments. That peg to the dollar is relentless. We are issuing these demand deposits, and people can cash out of a will. You need to have solid assets that can be liquidated quickly to honor that. I do not think the community honestly has thought through what it needs in terms of a risk appetite. We are showing what we think makes sense. But to get these high-quality investments that can be turned into cash reasonably quickly. You cannot take many risks, and you do not make much return on them.  We have been proposing and guiding; let us make high-quality investments. And let us look at where the real world is investing. We do not need to do the same stuff. But if someone brings us an investment in the real world, we would do this deal only if it is a million-dollar deal. They say, great, I will give you an $800,000 loan, but you put in the final $200,000. Often, we will get counterparties coming to us saying, give me a million dollars; I will not put anything under it. They are asking Maker to take a lot more risk than the real world. And that will be a fundamental question of why. Maybe the real world is off on this. You can always innovate. But then the fundamental question becomes: what basic rights and principles as a lender should make you give up that in the real world, it would insist on it? There are some difficult discussions here. We are typically trying to look at things versus the real world. And again, you do not have to do it the same. But if there are markedly more weaknesses, what is being proposed to us versus what the Real World would do. I think it asked some key questions. Over the last hundreds of years, lending has been a business that needs improvement. There are some basic principles about lending; it is easy to lend and hard to get paid back. How can you manage that risk? We generally want to be open to innovation, but we also want to use those basic lessons because people have lost money over the centuries learning these things. You want good collateral, you want more collateral than the low, you want to be able to see the collateral. We are asking for basic lending one-on-one things, and some parties are pushing that we do not ask for the basics, the tried and true stuff. That is a fair ask, but the Maker community needs to know what they are asking and why we view it so off the market as what the real world has done historically. It needs to put the onus on the borrower to explain why, in this deal, you do not need to have any first lost money under you. Every other deal in the world like this would, but we are special and different. And you do not need first loss protection. We struggle with finding the standard that the community wants and supports. The community wants us to take very aggressive lending standards. We can, but I like to tell people that I think Maker has some profound innovation. We do not want to innovate in ways to lose money as a lender. There are a lot of us. We do not need new ones.    1:16:31  Nadia Alvarez: Eric, can I ask you something? Like many people here, we do not understand the risk of certain asset originators. At least I was surprised when I read the risk assessment of Monetalis. You suggested a zero debt ceiling because usually, what the risk team does with crypto collaterals is when collateral is super risky; we give them a lower debt ceiling. Eric: Can I respond to that? I think that is a great one. If someone came to you with something really risky, you would charge more. But would you also adjust the advance rate? If I have a super risky coin, you will not give me an 80% advance rate. You might say, I will give you a 30% advance rate. Monetalis is asking for a 100% advance rate where the real world may get an 80% or 85% advance rate. If you read our assessment and look at our observations and risk pointers, you could flip that and say, is there a deal here that would make sense? There probably is, but it will start with real first loss money underneath us. You can think about everything we say negatively. Wait a minute, how would I make this work? How do I structure or change something that these guys would say? You guys do not have anyone who has ever run a credit fund. Everybody understands there is a deep credit manager. It is easy to understand in our minds what would fix that. We are just laying out principles. There are just basic principles in lending. How not to lose money. We are lining those basic principles up and commenting. I do not want to pick on Monetalis, but on how they stack up against those key principles, like the manager quality and experience in the asset, the money, our first-last position underneath us. There is an existing platform where they can manage all their business. Are they starting up from zero? We are ticking down the usual list of what are all the ways we could lose money? And what have they done to mitigate these? Nadia Alvarez: Yes, that is super clear. You can compare it with a token or a project without an audit. Maybe for projects like that, you will consider not even like one million debt selling because it is too much risk. It will be something like that. Eric: We got a presentation we have drawn up. Maybe we should give it to some people where we walked through what is it like being a Maker crypto lender versus being a real-world lender? And we look at what is similar and what is different. Then we try to show that you do not have liquid assets in the real world, do not see their prices, and cannot grab and sell them easily. So then the question becomes, if we do not have some of these really strong principles that you can use in crypto lending, what are our compensating factors to help manage the risk? Because we do not have nice liquidity or price transparency. We have made this presentation and applied it to Monetalis and systematically gone through that. And this is how we think about it. I will be happy to share it. Nadia Alvarez: Yes, please. I think that helps. Thank you. Eric: We would like to be more open and transparent. We should be more involved with discussing how we form opinions and listening to different views. We surely want to show you how we look at things so you people can understand why we have this view of things, like trying to show you what the glasses are that we put on when we look at these things. Will: I think that is a good point, Eric. We definitely should make an effort to have a Focus On session. We did that Focus On session on the methodology a couple of weeks ago, and it would be valuable to have a similar session on the topic. Eric: If I had my preference, it would never work. Anyone interested, let us go away for a week and have eight hours a day going through structured finance in great detail. I would probably get three people showing up, but there is a lot to do. Will: Yes, I do not think we will have that bandwidth. A lot of that is about educating. The worst thing that can happen is part of why some of these discussions have been bubbling up, which is the feeling of alienation. We should make every possible effort to reduce any feeling of alienation in the community. It would be very supportive of having a session like that. Max: Eric, count me in for that offset. You mentioned that there are principles. One of the principles of banking or lending in the real world that I am aware of is the golden rule, which is that he who has the gold makes the rules. Maker has the gold. The borrowers should not bully Maker. And that is a really important principle. Eric: If I had to pick one principal. And I did not hear that said before. You picked probably the defining one where the lenders should design their lending strategy. You do not want the borrower telling the lender how to view risk. If you are the stockholders in the lender, you do not want the borrower to dictate terms. If you are the shareholder in the borrower, you would prefer the borrower to dictate terms. Payton Rose: If there are any last comments, questions, or suggestions, I encourage you to voice them now. Huge thanks to everyone who helped put this together. Thanks to our speakers, to everyone commenting on this and engaging in the discussion. Let us keep the chat going in the forum and on our Discord channel. I appreciate it. Eric: We have got our RWA office hours tomorrow. Please show up. We want to be overinclusive. We prefer people to say shut up about structured finance because we do not want to hear it anymore instead of being perceived as not open. Payton Rose: What time are those office hours? Will: 5 pm on Thursday UTC. Every Thursday, we have office hours to have these types of discussions but maybe with more depth. Then people can tell us to shut up because they are tired of hearing the same things repeatedly. Or have any thoughtful discussions from the borrower or the lender side of things and how we look at them.   Conclusion  Payton Rose 1:25:36  Awesome. Thanks for the chatter. We will close it out there and see you simultaneously and place it next week. Thanks.

Welcome to episode #183 of the Scientific Governance & Risk for MakerDAO. My name is Payton, I go by Prose11 online, and I am one of the governance facilitators. On this call, we have many awesome people who work for the Maker protocol interested in what is going on. This is our weekly meeting where we go over what is happening on the governance side and discuss the protocol\u2019s risks. We will start with a couple of housekeeping matters. This is being recorded. Please, try not to speak over one another. You can use the chat or the raised hand function to let us know you have something to say. We will be happy to incorporate you into the speaking list or the flow of the conversation. We want this to be an open meeting. If you have questions, concerns, comments, please feel free to participate. I am happy to speak your thoughts for you. If you are unable or unwilling to hop on the mic, just drop it in the chat, and we will work them in.   Our Agenda Today:  We will start with a governance roundup going through the votes, MIPS, and the latest on the Maker forum. There are no initiative updates today. Our discussion topic today is tokenomics and growth for the protocol. There will be open discussions if we have time in the end. If there is anything unrelated to what you have seen but would like to talk about, drop it in the chat, and we will get to it.

It is the tokenomics and growth proposals. If you have been watching the forums lately, we have had a couple of different tokenomics proposals. Monet-Supply submitted one, and we had another that Porter posted from a16z. You can say Rune kicked off this recent method of tokenomics proposals with the Sagittarius Engine a few months back. In the midst of that, we also had a post from a cross-Core Unit group of actors about an aggressive growth strategy for Maker. This is our discussion segment to collate all these different ideas, talk about what are good tokenomics fundamentals to have, how we should be evaluating different proposals that come forth, and in general, how we should be structuring our governance decisions and our community involvement to shape the growth of the protocol. A few people on this call have proposed tokenomics revisions or growth plans. We invite them to talk about their framing for proposing those and why they thought it necessary.  14:23  Porter Smith: I work for a16z on the Investment team, the Network Operations team. I want to provide some quick context on how we look at this, why we did a tokenomics proposal in the first place, and also recognize the prioritization efforts of scarce engineering resources. We came forward with this tokenomics proposal that was long in the making. It takes a while to get through the regulatory compliance process on our end before posting something publicly. The main thrust of what we are interested in is adding utility functionality to tokens. This provides a new regulatory dimension to the tokens. That is an important context for everyone to understand. We completely recognize that adding or changing tokenomics can be a complex endeavor that requires engineering resources. For us, it is a much longer-term focus. It is not something that needs to be done in the next week. However, it is structurally important long-term, and we are very long-term oriented, which is why we proposed it. The second thing I would like to provide more context on is the regulatory side. If a token has utility functionality, it must add new dynamics to how it might be analyzed from the regulatory perspective. There are many ways to do that. We put some ideas out there about ways that could be interesting. We recognize the pros and cons of those ideas. We are not married to any of them. That was the best stuff we came up with. We are more than happy to get feedback. We would love to hear what everyone thinks. Lastly, I know Monet-Supply and Sam recently put out some other proposals. We are flexible and more than happy to integrate. We are interested in all good ideas and will bring a unique regulatory look at things. Often, if we phrase or do things a certain way, that is what is driving it. I am more than happy to discuss further with anyone. We would love to hear everyone\u2019s ideas on it. We are very laid-back with this. If everyone thinks it is terrible, then no big deal. We wanted to put it out there and generate ideas.  17:44  Frank Cruz: I am a 3F Delegate. I had a chance to read some of the proposals you put up, but I wanted to hear from you. What are your thoughts on the Surplus Buffer? How is your team thinking about expanding the Surplus Buffer? With regards to regulations, how does that fall into the whole picture of what you talked about a second ago? How can we have the tokenomics of MKR fit the mold that makes sense, not necessarily for everyone in the world, but more for Americans like myself and you? I wanted to hear your thoughts on that.  Porter Smith: We will make a written response to that proposal. We must route it through our regulatory legal folks first. We generally view having a large surplus buffer as the right thing. Fundamentally, during a startup\u2019s growth stage, where MakerDAO is now, capital allocation becomes a question. What should you be spending hard-earned retained earnings on? Should it be on growth, backstopping, or perhaps some black swan event? Maybe on other items? What makes the most sense is to continue to pull that capital and have that ammo at the community\u2019s disposal to set forth on any channels that they see appropriate. The first step in that process has a much larger surplus buffer. That allows flexibility on the community\u2019s ends to either direct it towards growth initiatives or as an insurance backstop. One idea of our proposals was the idea of a secondary surplus buffer. It is denominated in the native MKR token, which we recognize is undoubtedly not ideal compared to a cash-based insurance buffer because of the token\u2019s volatility. Also, if something goes wrong, that insurance buffer may be worth quite a bit less than you initially anticipated. Interestingly, though, if you stake MKR in this secondary surplus buffer, you are actively participating in the enterprise. If you earn cash-based or Dai-based yield for actively participating in the enterprise and putting your assets at risk, from a regulatory perspective in the United States, that is a great way to distribute some of that value to token holders. They are actively participating in the enterprise, putting their assets at risk. They are not relying solely on the efforts of others, which is some of the key languages I am sure many of you have heard before. So that is the idea behind the secondary surplus buffer. I am more than happy to go further in-depth in anything that might be helpful.    20:40  Frank Cruz: To clarify, you are more of a proponent of handing out. For example, if we stake Maker as Monet-Supply has proposed, are you folks more in favor accruing MKR rewards or paying out Dai-like dividends? What is your stance on that?  Porter Smith: There are two things there. The first piece is that we would be more interested in cash or Dai denominated distributions for regulatory reasons. On the Surplus Buffer piece in general, again, that is a capital allocation question. We would like to see as large of a surplus buffer as possible while the community figures out the right direction on the allocation front. That enables that flexibility. I have talked to many folks, and many of them are somewhat in the same boat. Maker had certain policies in place for a while that has made sense. Perhaps it makes sense to continue them. But in our eyes, maintaining a larger surplus buffer makes much sense.    21:57  Payton Rose: One criticism we have seen online when these different tokenomics models come on is the attacks on people who are not paying attention. If you change a tokenomics model, people who participate get more rewards than those who are not paying attention or are otherwise blocked from participating. You dilute them. I am not sure if that might be a good thing to discuss, whether it will be fixed with certain time requirements or general philosophy.  Porter Smith: Yes. That is a great point. We certainly understand that. You want to incentivize active participation and reward folks that are actively contributing in a meaningful way to the community. We put out this idea of creating an MKR denominated vesting pool for delegates and active non-delegate voters so that their incentives are aligned in ways like how employees would be at any other startup. Web3 is fundamentally different because everyone is actively participating, and, to varying degrees, members have an active startup. That was some of our thoughts there. There is certainly a balance where you strictly do not want rewards to go to certain folks and not others.    23:48  Kianga Daverington: I wanted to hear from folks in engineering around the resource question and hear thoughts about priority. It feels like this conversation around changing the tokenomics may be correlated with an uptick in the MKR price the other week. Is there is a sense that addressing this issue of progressing the tokenomics could be positive for all the other things we try to achieve? This includes attracting counterparties and proving across all the dimensions we are trying to grow. In this conversation, I would love to hear about the resource question and prioritize how people are thinking about this.  Derek: I am Derek from PE. That is a great question. It is a question where we need to understand the requirements frame, the problems we are trying to resolve, and then map out what this means from the governance of voting perspective and the work needed to create a new chief contract. This is not a problem. That effort needs to be mapped out in terms of requirements, understanding the impacts, and how it plays out across the rest of the ecosystem. It would be very useful to align these different opportunities and document them as a concise list of requirements. That will take some discussion. I am happy to play a role and be involved in that. I am happy for others to add input as well. Brian McMichael: None of these plans are free. Some involve major and fundamental changes to the core system and Maker token itself. We currently have mandates or at least guidance for deploying on every viable L2, preparing D3Ms for everybody that we can, working to streamline the RWA process from a technical level, and protocol maintenance. This will be a big interrupt on the resources and affect other core initiatives. There is a whole bunch of competing proposals right now. So it is hard to speak to any of them because we do not know which way people will go.    27:09  Payton Rose: A governance concern is that we want proposals to be addressed and understood before making the changes. And it is an unfortunate situation we have had in the past where governments have approved things, and then we do not have a timeline. We do not know when, if ever, they will be integrated. Usually, it comes from a lack of communication. We have not fully scoped out what the work would entail before bringing it to vote. I see some good comments here on the sideboard comparing growth versus tokenomics. Does anyone want to speak to that dichotomy of needing to invest more in one versus the other?  Kirk Hutchison: I am from PE. There is this classic debate of to what extent our tokenomics improvements are a growth mechanism versus something secondary to growth. I have gone through a personal journey where a year and a half ago, I was very excited about changing tokenomics. After thinking about it all that time, I am now not all that excited about it because it has become clear to me from the market that there is only one thing that matters, and that is scaling. Find ways to grow the Dai supply and expand to L2s or wherever the economic activity is happening so that Dai can become an integral component of the Web3, crypto economy, whatever you want to call it. I do not see a world where Maker succeeds or fails because it did not upgrade its tokenomics to be more appealing to stakeholders or have a little more or less regulatory component in some particular direction.   I view tokenomics as a tertiary concern compared to scaling and security and growing business efforts, like RWA, because the Maker token still retains the rights to all future cash flows and present assets. That is entirely sufficient to value a financial asset. No matter what form capital return takes, it can always be changed in the future. In particular, many of these proposed changes are very sweeping things that are big investments. Once you make a huge investment like that, sometimes you get locked into it. Then there is no time to go back and redo it in the future. We should think very carefully before making any large changes to tokenomics in the short term. Governance sets the priorities for whatever protocol engineering works on. However, if there is a disagreement, the voting weight falls on what we do. That is my rant.  30:38  JustinCase: I most largely agree with the last few speakers on the cost of the engineering tokenomics model. From the conversations I have been having with different CUs and the posts I have been seeing, I do not see tokenomics itself as a hindrance to growth. Nobody has raised that as an issue. With a pretty major backlog on some of the projects, it is prudent to push these proposals further down the timeline and capitalize on other kinds of growth. This is my take on it at the current time.  Porter Smith: We are not looking at this as something that needs to be done in the short term. We are looking at this to figure out just longer-term priorities. We generally defer to engineers and engineering talent on what needs to be done on that side of the house. As far as strategy goes, we look at this as more of just a long-term thing for community discussion that perhaps once we get past some of these core growth initiatives that are occurring right now, could be tackled down the line. I wanted to clarify that we are not looking to do anything immediately. We are not looking to displace current initiatives. We understand that. It was more to foster some general discussion around some of these ideas for things that hopefully are not core revamps of the token but perhaps new ways to use it. I understand that installing a secondary surplus buffer might involve some engineering work. Some of the other ideas, such as permanently increasing the current surplus buffer, are things we were looking to implement more in the medium term. Makerman: I have been looking at the history. We are talking about an engine\u2014Maker itself as an engine for financial achievements. I was thinking a lot about growth, and I see the proposals for increasing the Surplus Buffer so we can do 100 million deals. I am back to the same question when MCD came out. Are we going to get to a billion with a one in 10 million deal? The last year, what was growth like, what dominated growth: WBTC, the PSM, and ETH, basically going up a factor of 20. Those are the three key things that did our growth. Can we do that another factor of 10 using the existing engine when I look at that? If we think we will have 60 billion USDC as one of our core growth components, it does not work. I look at where the real world is at. My issue here is that I think that we are trying to run a car on an old engine, and we need to look at our competition. My thinking is that we need to look at a Maker 3.0. I can hear the groans from PE. When I look across the space, how many different things can we do to supercharge this protocol when a surplus limits us? Even if we can grow that to 250 million, we are still doing 100, maybe 200 million things that may or may not grow to billions, and then we will still have the same problem with the Surplus Buffer? I keep thinking we have to do a Maker 3.0, and we have to recapitalize to the tune of a billion to 10 billion. We could do maybe ten deals a year, which is challenging. We need to do these deals in the one to 10 billion range, not the 100 million range. When I think about growth, I want to segregate and focus on what we can do with the engine now, with Maker 2.0, and make a nimble core group and look at the competition and figure out how to raise capital. I have a crazy idea. It is a Maker 3.0 token with 1 trillion minted worth $1 that we back. And then we VC that out for a billion, or two, or three a capital and drive a whole new Maker 3.0 system in a place that uses Maker 2.0, feeds Maker 2.0, and creates Maker 3.0. I look at this, and I think we are struggling with too many issues. One of them is capitalization. The other one is operational, being able to opt to do deals. We are struggling to piece together an old facility. And we want to change things, which is a long-term vision, but we also want to strategize on the old, and we are having difficulty doing that. I would like to see an approach that is a little more forward-thinking and bigger than the proposed.    36:21  Prose11: You bring up a good point in terms of there being a lot of different factors to consider and things going on at once. For the tokenomics side, for instance, the current price is not a pressing concern of the MKR token in terms of system stability. However, if our total value locked were to keep increasing, there can be a real sudden vulnerability when the market cap of the governance token is far lower than all the assets it secures. The other thing that I heard from Porter is this idea of regulatory security. You can be doing something to make your token safer from a regulation standpoint that adds some value or some pause for consideration. There is value in balancing many factors, even just moving forward with the discussion. That is why we appreciate a wide variety of impacts.  37:39  Robert: I want to set the context as there is growth. I posted in the forums about understanding and agreeing on where we are in the organizational life cycle. I think we are in a growth phase. I agree with Porter; he has made some of the comments. I talked about productization and products from the beginning of collateral engineering services; I hope this is becoming clearer now as we have much technology. One of the challenges is that we sometimes try to find homes for this technology, searching for a solution. When we look at our collateral, it is quite the opposite. We want to look for use cases and understand the business behind what we are doing with Dai, how it is generated, where we invest our time and money, and the best places to put that. Much of that has to do with the market analysis and the quote-unquote competition. I know many people have done much work, but we must bring this together from a product perspective and ask ourselves: what do we need to build to grow the protocol? We focused a lot on collateral and other areas. I wanted to share my perspective of CES looking at our collateral and continuing to productize that.  Payton Rose: We have talked about the tokenomics side of things. I am curious if anyone from the group that put forward the aggressive growth strategy post - if there is anything you would like to say you are presenting this call and be a good time to do it. At the start of the call, Wouter made some points about separated operations. However, if I am not butchering the terminology behind that - I do not know if you would like to speak about that matter or not. That is undoubtedly a concept for growth we can be considering. Due to the structure of the SP, I do not need to explain this too much. I see Wouter coming online.    41:29  Wouter: I think it is simple. Right now, the surplus buffer serves multiple purposes. With the discussions about the growth that we have had, we need to think about how we can start setting a direction. How can we be more purposeful about the growth? We need to make a plan and ensure that the necessary resources are available. Some plans have a longer-term outlook rather than just month by month. From a convenient point of view, the immediate problem is that we can not meaningfully speak about our runway because everything is in the surplus buffer. These different purposes do not separate them. From a practical point of view, I think that a fix would be setting aside the runway for the operational expenses and separating it from the rest of the surface buffer. That is a requirement if we want to become better at long-term planning, and this is a theme I noticed throughout all of these discussions. There is confusion about what is short-term and long-term. It is important to separate the two to structure these discussions. Porter commented that this is a long-term thing. We need to be able to have these long-term discussions. For example, we should know our engineering costs, but we should not look at our current backlog and say that it is not a priority if we have a long-term discussion. The question of how we will then fit this into our roadmap is a different question. We need to separate these things to have meaningful discussions. This change would start separating the operational runway from the rest of the surplus buffer, which would help us think longer-term and work on longer-term roadmaps.  44:20  Prose11: For those who did not read or are not familiar with the growth strategy plan, an aspect of that was either selling debt or equity in hopes of financing operations.  Juan: Many CUs, including ours, asked for buffers and runways that could be potentially pulled together if necessary. I am not entirely sure about the implementation of the execution, but that should be at least accounted for differently when we are thinking about operational expenses and cash flow. They are two different things. Hopefully, if CU runs into the buffer very often, they should review their budget. These are essential topics to be separated because it is tough to make decisions or have a clear picture of our finances.   Brian McMichael: One of the reasons I am not sold on the hypergrowth model is that there is no real plan for those hundreds of millions of Dai just sitting there. We talked about capital efficiency; I can use returns much better than letting them sit in the pool. On the other hand, that pool itself can be a target honeypot or a slush fund, even for new CU, overly aggressive spending, or just things not intended right now. There is no real limitation on how that can be used in the future. Some separations of where that money goes, maybe to a separate backstop pool where it is differentiated from the pile, would be a little more reassuring.  Justin: I want to expand on what Michael brought up. I think many demands are going to the surface buffer, it started essentially as a security thing, and then everybody got hooked into it. Having a separation to ensure we maintain that security bit of it and protect that one from ongoing expenses and other issues is worth following. Besides the pool size, I am concerned about the inflow rate into the offer because that has been steadily going down the past few months. We need to address that issue and how much is actually in there because if they dip into the negative, which is a real possibility, if it turns into a bear market, then we have too many obligations to make this work. We have to cover our running expenses and ensure the protocol stays safe. We want to spend the same money to speak on growth initiatives, which is not possible. At some point, there are too many obligations for too little capital. I think the most immediate concern is trying to increase the rate of inflow into our servers. There are two ways of doing that: increasing our revenue or decreasing our costs; I fear we have to look at both.   ElPro: Regarding another side of that trade, the aggressive growth proposal by our community members talks about the risks that the protocol will be taking on soon. One of them is the Starknet bridge, and the other two bridges: Arbitron and Optimism. There are other things that we will be doing hopefully in the future, which I know I have been waiting for forever, such as onboarding or RWA collateral types. A surplus buffer should be set to one side where a different smart contract protects it. We can take all these risks. We just had someone, Solana and jump trading, take a 300 million dollar hit, and it was covered pretty quickly because of the Solana wormhole. When you look at the proposal, you need to dig in and see what the authors were pointing out to the community - we will be taking on risks coming up. Somehow, someway, I do not want to relive March 2020. I am a big proponent of having a large cushion of a surplus buffer and whatever you decide to do as far as allocating it to operational growth or having it as an insurance fund.  50:52  Nadia Alvarez: I was listening to what Brian said. We have many ideas about why we need a higher surplus buffer. First of all, we need to expand with a multi-chain strategy. All the efforts we are making now about having Maker vaults on Arbitron, Optimism, and Starknet are fantastic, but why not have Maker vaults in Polygon and any other side chain where we can do something to grow that market. We need to increase the surplus buffer to achieve that because if you see all the Dai that we have in Polygon, it is about 200 million Dai. With the current surplus buffer, it will be impossible for us to accept that amount of Dai minted through the Maker vaults and replace POS Dai on Polygon for the canonical Dai that we will mint with the Maker vault. If we cannot replace that amount of Dai on Polygon, I think deploying Maker vaults in Polygon does not make that much sense. When we wrote the proposal, increasing the surplus buffer was bad was because we wanted to create new products and services around the Maker. Of course, we know to create more CUs because if we want to deploy Maker on Polygon, we will need a team dedicated to Polygon, same as what we are doing with Starknet. We have to be more strategic on costs associated with CU and all these Dai that we will have in the new and higher surplus buffer. It is more like supporting the growth of the protocol by new collaterals by adding new domains having vaults in different side chains and L2s. Also, we want to grow the real-world assets initiative because that is part of Maker\u2019s strategy. To do that, we need a higher surplus buffer. I think that is why we thought about increasing the surplus buffer. I agree with what Adrian wrote in the chat. We have to review how we will spend that surplus buffer because the idea is to use it to help the protocol growth in our services. Still, we have to be careful and not spend it on a million new CUs, but without new things that we implement in the protocol. We have to be careful about that.  Brian McMichael:  I did not mean we should not have a higher surplus buffer. We need one, just in light of the amount of collateral we have on board. The concern is just that when we get those large numbers, we probably want assurances to ourselves that they will be used for those things and then just not dipped into to add a whole bunch of new people. We will need to add new people, but we want to ensure that it will be used as a risk buffer and not a runaway.    55:00  Prose11: I think you are touching on potential criticism of our tokenomics model, Brian. Essentially, we design it to take profits and give them back to MKR holders by buying back shares and burning or buying back tokens and burning. However, suppose we are to stop profits from occurring. In that case, that value goes to the insiders of the system rather than to the token holders, supporting our collateralization\u2019s potential risks.  Someone: Exactly, that is one perspective.   Prose11: There are many different perspectives, but I think the middle ground between these competing ideas will often be the most prudent decision. I appreciate you bringing that forward. I know this is a large topic, and it is somewhat nebulous, and it touches on just about all areas of our operation. I do not want to cut the discussion or have it short. With that said, you want to make sure that if there are other things we want to talk about, we have a chance for that. I have seen several good potential side topics in the chat. I do not know if there is anyone we would like to explore fully, but one that keeps coming up. I saw it in your comment there, Josh. Is this idea of recognizing delegates and their role within the system? Several of you on this call are participating, so you might have some thoughts there. The recognized delegates, essentially, are a different group of stakeholders. We hear primarily from CU and CU facilitators; as one part of the stakeholders of our DAO system, recognized delegates are the newest kind of addition to our organizational model. There have been some good threads. I posted a good response regarding what recognized delegates\u2019 responsibilities could be.  Someone: As we are talking about tokenomics, is there value in having a voter or delegate that remains neutral? They do not necessarily have a view but try to respond to what they feel the community needs or wants. This is the delegate\u2019s perspective versus the active delegate. All of us involved in the space have experience and a view of where we would like to see Web3, DeFi, and Maker go. Therefore, we could very quickly have a point of view that we tried to persuade the community towards. That is the mode I have heard in some conversations. The delegates should be working in terms of proposing and advocating. I am curious to hear on this call in this context if that is the strong sense that people have about a delegate role. I have approached this work from a judiciary mode. I want to hear both sides and be that disinterested party that tries to help the community come to the best result based upon this set of standards pre-communicated and agreed upon by the community.    59:55  Wouter:  I think it is probably the most crucial point. We talk about the need for vision and strategy. When we talk about growth, it immediately leads back to that. The question is, who will create the vision and strategy? How do we connect it to the operations? That is where I think the most significant change is needed. I am a big proponent of delegates clearly stating their platform, vision, and political agenda and being elected based on that. I think it will introduce two new dynamics. It will help with this need for vision and strategy to align our efforts toward a long-term goal. Second, it will also reduce the tendency to micromanage on the other side of the equation. If delegates are not outspoken about division and the strategy they want to follow, then the alternative is that there is a great tendency to micromanage if things go wrong. We see the limits of the budget. This is one of the significant risks that we flip towards micromanagement, and we need to learn how we can work more efficiently. I think that is all very important; CU, for example, retains a large degree of independence because things will not work in a decentralized organization if we combine certain tools from the centralized world. If we are not careful, we will end up with the worst of both worlds rather than leveraging the strengths of the decentralized organization. When there is a need for correction, the question is: how do you do it? Today, this may be one of the missing pieces: the very understandable hesitation. Still, some hesitation from delegates to clearly state our platform and push for a specific direction, and try and convince MKR holders that this is the right direction to go. This is probably the most important thing that we can change due to progress. Many of the issues we are seeing are starting to think about delegates, real delegate platforms, and apparent differences in opinion between delegates. Delegates sometimes put too much effort into agreeing about everything. I believe it is acceptable for delegates to disagree. It should be evident when they disagree so that MKR holders can make a clear choice. That might be the next phase that we need to progress with many issues that we see, as I said. Prose11: I was wondering, in some ways, we set up the delegates to almost search for that consensus. It was often a pain to get executive proposals passed for those of you who remembered before we had recognized delegates. There would be more than a week where we would be left waiting to see our equal change consisting of all things that have previously been pulled, voted, and approved. Will this take place? Or will we suffer because we do not have enough people to activate it?  01:04:44  Wouter:  I think that is another confusion: the role of an executive proposal. I did not believe that all the due processes were followed and that there had been the correct net procedure to make sure that delegates were able to vote on the governance polls, etc. The executive vote is signing the deployment of the functionality. It is different, almost a technical role. There is a safety feature there. Of course, that is a measure of last resort to stop malicious changes to the protocol. It needs to be separated from the political disagreements because it is more like an operational role in signing the deployment.  Someone: I agree. I think it says a role to play in setting a strategic plan. They should do it alone. However, this should come from Maker holders themselves. The delegates are barely carrying out the will of the Maker holders; the big strategic picture is what is Maker is about and what are we trying to achieve? That should, in many cases, be sourced from the Maker holders or the community. Providing such as should at least have some input from outside of the delegates themselves, and it should probably be a collaboration effort; maybe delegates are in the best position to start that work. That might very well be the case. I am also slightly wary about the whole separation of powers issue here. If you empower delegates to sit down, dream up their suggestions, and then go and vote on them, you are essentially short-circuiting everything else out of the decision process. As you can see, from the most comfortable going, almost all delegates are carrying the votes through different proposals. I am worried about that part as well.   Wouter: These are essential points. I agree that it should not happen in a vacuum. Delegates are supposed to work for MKR holders, and it is the MKR holders should decide which vision and strategy are followed. However, this is what an election mechanism is for\u2014a political party. In a democracy, how it works is that it creates a platform and talks to its electorate. It looks at possibilities for execution, summarizes everything in a vision and strategy that they believe reflects the electorate\u2019s wishes, and hopefully has a realistic plan of succeeding. The electorate shows what is being presented, voted on, and this is how this will is expressed. I do not think there is a contradiction between delegates making up their plans and MKR holders making the ultimate decision. I think they work the same. If the plan is articulated, then MKR holders have a choice. Whereas if the plan is not articulated, MKR holders vote blindly. They need to spend a lot more time, and the time they do not have to maybe come up with something themselves. That is not their role. They do not have the time for that as they are not full-time working for MakerDAO. I think the two are closely related. It would benefit delegates to state their vision and strategy that they believe will resonate with the MKR voters and have a realistic execution plan. The other point about voting on your proposals is that I agree with them, which goes into the micromanagement aspect. It is one thing to define a vision and a strategy. I think the other part should be supporting CUs and execution plans. This is different from making concrete proposals about how something should be done or trying to dictate how experts should be doing their work that goes in the wrong direction. I think it is topless on the side of micromanagement, which is the concern. Of course, there are more direct risks, as if you have enough voting power, you can put up an executive vote and vote on it yourself. There is a possibility of corruption, which we need to think about. We can devise mechanisms that would make that not impossible because there could be certain alarm procedures or safety mechanisms to prevent that  01:11:22  Wouter: The next question that will come up is maybe there are a set of decisions, and the first example of that is the delegate compensation itself, where we have what was mentioned in the chat before: should delegates even vote on this? Should they recuse themselves from that? Maybe there are several numbers of things that because delegates are conflicted. This is something that MKR holders should vote directly on or that at least delegates cannot change without creating enough visibility if they try to change it. It is against the wishes of the MKR holders that there is enough time to remove their voting power. If we look at political structures, there are solutions to this, but I agree it is something to be careful about. We need to ensure that the necessary checks and balances are in place. I do not think that delegates are indeed not in a vacuum. Still, delegates are developing their vision and strategy and trying to be elected on that platform - I do not think that is a contradiction. I think it would help a lot.  Prose11: It brings up a good point there. It came up as a panel discussion. I remember one of the panels I was sitting on because governance attacks often can look quite similar to legitimate government action. If we normalize delegates, proposing things and then voting on them, there is not too much difference between something the delegate earnestly believes is suitable for the protocol versus \u201ctaking advantage of the protocol.\u201d   Wouter: To clarify, a delegate\u2019s proposal is exactly what the MKR holders would vote on, right? Because they propose their vision and strategy, the MKR holders vote on the vision and strategy; it is not the delegates voting on it. Because the vote there is the act of delegating MKR to the delegate you believe in or the platform you believe in. The MIPS that the delegates vote on is an entirely different matter. I read that we need to be careful and ensure that the necessary safety mechanisms are in place and that the separation of powers and checks and balances are all respected.  01:14:14  Prose11:  That is a good point: the more information, the closer to the vision conveyed in a delegate platform, like the closer we are to when MKR voters delegate to them. We have this assumption that they have laid out what they will be using that MKR for and then got MKR delegated to them because of that. It is a bit of a stronger signal than perhaps the groundwork we have laid out so far.  Wouter: I have one last comment. We are going forward with the initiative presented last week, an experiment. The cross CU coordination initiatives that we have seen around L2 collateral management of on-chain, collateral management off-chain, and security inspired it. Everyone recognizes that more coordination is needed. The initiative presented last week will be the first time we have the coordination process that brings both core units and delegates together, and delegates are explicit stakeholders. I hope that we can use the discussion about the better resilience of MakerDAO on an operational and financial level to try and come to an emergent strategy and vision. I want to have those discussions with all the interested delegates and then, at the same time, make sure that it is transparent so that everyone can see what is happening. The discord channel has been created and is available for everyone. For the next step, I have outlined bullet points on how I would like to work on this as a facilitator of the coordination process. I will be reaching out to individual delegates to have individual conversations because we cannot have one big group of people who do everything together. As a facilitator, I will reach out to the individuals, and then we will have regular meetings. Maybe a little longer meeting than usual, one and a half-hour, two hours, but not every week. Instead, every two or three weeks, bring all the results together from those individual discussions. At the same time, think in practice about the resiliency mechanisms that we can use to improve Maker\u2019s resiliency and connect to those higher-level vision and strategies that I hope the delegates will know will play a significant role in. If you were unaware of the initiative, then make sure to check the Discord channel watch the recording from last week\u2019s GNR call, and before the end of this week, I will post the outline of the plan and start reaching out to people.

My name is Payton; I go by Prose11 online. I am one of the Governance Facilitators at Maker. Today I am joined by other workers and people generally interested in the DAO and the protocol. As usual, we have an Agenda to get through today. We are recording this meeting. Side comments or questions are always welcome in our sidebar. You can use the raise hand feature on Zoom to join the speaking queue. We want everyone to participate in the conversation, do not be shy to speak up. As far as the Agenda goes, we will start with our governance roundup. Then we will move on to initiative updates pertaining to ETH Denver, in which many of the Core Units took part. We have selected a discussion topic: is the DAO equipped to work with service provider CUs. We will tune in for an open discussion if there is still time.

I hope it is all clear. All proposals are currently passing. All but one was passed unanimously.   Proposals in RFC960\u00d7540 12.1 KB   RFC MIPs960\u00d7540 24.9 KB   MIP65 establishes a framework to arrange, coordinate, and execute a Liquid Bond Strategy to replace part of the current Maker USDC Exporter. MIP61, Delegate Compensation, is still being trialed. It has seen a couple of changes recently, so please give it a new read if you have not in the last couple of weeks.   Core Unit Budgets960\u00d7540 28.3 KB   Core Unit Offboarding960\u00d7540 19.7 KB   Deimos has posted the draft of an Offboarding Proposal set for removing the MakerDAO Shop.   Amendments960\u00d7540 26.1 KB   MIP4c2-SP15 amends the Core Unit Framework, defining MIPs 39, 40, and 41 to improve the current less-than-great Core Unit Offboarding Process. The pull request for this amendment will soon be incorporating all the feedback it has received so far, so please keep an eye on it. MIP4c2-SP17 amends MIP64, which defines the Bug Bounty Program run by Immunefi Security to make small payments more agile. This entails a modification to Immunefi Security\u2019s previous budgets.  Originally, this was MIP43, an amendment for proposals younger than three months, which had a shorter-than-usual feedback period of one week. We discussed this with Joshua and agreed that it would be better to stay on RFC for a bit longer and enter the monthly cycle instead. If you have not checked it out, please do. We think it is important for this proposal to gain more exposure.     Others960\u00d7540 33.3 KB   We have renewed the mandate for the Governance Communications Core Unit, whose goal is to adjust its accuracy and to provide enhanced accessibility to the Core Unit\u2019s documentation. A Declaration of Intent-Invest in Short-term Bonds is proposed as a solution to MakerDAO having its balance sheet composed of around 60% stable points.   That&#39;s all for MIPs960\u00d7540 5.64 KB   Gala and I have been reaching out to remind authors that the posting period for eligible proposals starts on March 2nd. The formal submission window for March opens on Monday 7th.   Forum at a Glance  Artem Gordon 07:27 Post: Forum at a Glance: February 17th - 24th, 2022 Video: Forum at a Glance  Initiative Updates  David Utrobin 13:09  I want to add some context. We aim to do an Initiative Update once every month for each active initiative being tracked. We will do things slightly differently. We will put each initiative in context and assess its progress to effectively decide if it is worth including in a particular update. We will still be targeting monthly appearances, although this could vary.   ETH-Denver  ETH Denver Updates960\u00d7540 128 KB   Dai Foundation 14:25  Dai Foundation960\u00d7540 87.9 KB   We have noticed we need a dedicated event targeted to the MakerDAO community members, specifically for the Dai Foundation. We took the discussion over to the Governance Communications Core Unit and agreed to bring several Core Units to ETH Amsterdam. This is precisely for the Dai Foundation and its board to be present and specific Mandated Actors and recognized Delegates.  We have done some temperature testing during ETH Denver to see if we can make that happen, so that could be one of the upcoming items on everybody\u2019s agenda.     Real World Finance  David Utrobin 16:34  RWF Core Unit @ ETH Denver960\u00d7540 96 KB   PECU  Derek 17:30  PECU @ ETH Denver960\u00d7540 130 KB   Questions:  David Utrobin: Paper Imperium was asking in the chat about the conversation with TrueFi.  Derek: Dialogue started assessing our opportunities in terms of scaling. They support undercollateralized loans similar to Maple and offer multiple loan types. If we can onboard them comparable to Maple, that would give us a scalable solution.   Person 1: It is key to add that they have exposure to Real-World Assets. What is boring about Maple is crypto speculation. With TrueFi there are real-world user experiences. For example, in Mexico, they provide credit lines for real businesses via TrueFi. Therefore, it would be a great way to get exposure to Real-World Assets.  Person 2: We will have a call with Maple later. Their business model is very different. It seems promising, but we need to determine the best structure and risk-return profile. If they do things the proper way, they can leverage their platform without us reinventing the wheel on the structure inside.   Person 1: Furthermore, with this uncollateralized lending, there is an increased possibility of default. This is why we should have a reasonable surplus buffer again.  Person 2: It depends on your structure. Maple, for example, is uncollateralized on-chain. We could ask the junior pool delegates that required security off-chain through contracts with the borrowers to absorb most of the first losses to decrease risk. I, as an individual, would never advise the protocol to do a D3M with something uncollateralized, managed from the other side of the world by a single team that is yielding 25%. That would seem like throwing money out of the window.   Derek: It was good to kick off the discussion and bring people together to have it face to face. We can now take it to the Forum and continue it on.   GovAlpha  Payton Rose 23:33  GovAlpha Core Unit @ ETH Denver960\u00d7540 265 KB   This was my first GovAlpha conference due to the Pandemic and not getting my Passport in time for Lisbon. I got to explore and see what was going on. I found the whole experience very valuable. Thanks to Lenkla is was able to get up on stage for the \u201cFuture-proofing Governance Panel.\u201d  A lot of the feedback for that was that we need to discuss Governance more often in this space. A good signal was that not many other seniors talked about Governance issues.     CES  Robert 24:58  CES Core Unit @ ETH Denver960\u00d7540 308 KB   We were hoping to have an off-site first, but unfortunately, all the craziness in the world and some passport issues disabled us from doing that. Nevertheless, Kau\u00ea was able to make it, and I made it too. For us, the two main areas were education and goodwill, followed by the Maker relationship building.  The first part allows us to learn about new projects, networking, focusing on community building education, which is critically important, as we are in this in-between time with not having a formal marketing presence inside of MakerDAO. Another invaluable part of it is that, after two years of screen-time with co-workers, ETH Denver evidenced how important IRL is to get things done, to build tighter relationships with everybody. After leaving ETH Denver, we will build upon to get our work done when we collaborate or ask questions. It is critically important, and there is a theme of that going on here.   In light of recent events, I want to mention that we have a team member who lives in Lviv, in Western Ukraine. That is on the border of Poland. I would ask of you, whatever your belief system might be, to hold him in your prayers. It is challenging for him and his family, as he has a young baby. I\u2019d appreciate your consideration for him in these trying times.   GovComms  David Utrobin 27:26  GovComms @ ETH Denver960\u00d7540 66.5 KB   The three of us talked about the strategy for GovComms for the next few quarters. We discussed what resources our team needs to further improve its offerings, to professionalize what it does. For that, we would like to bring on somebody from the Public Relations side that can help MakerDAO.  A part of that was attending several meetings and Maker events. We independently met with various stakeholders in the organization and had many conversations about Coordination and Comms. One of my missions during this trip was to gather feedback around GovComms moving to expand and make a proposal to hire a PR professional. The feedback was positive for that movement, so it will be a part of our budget proposal, which will be up in about a week.   We had a very productive ETH Denver. Meeting people in real life is crazy. Zoom is good, but when you spend the same time in person with a handful of people, there is so much more. You get a much richer conversation. You get a lot. It also gives you a chance to bond with the people in the organization, finds that cohesion, and reaffirm the knowledge that we are all on a team together, although we are independent Core Units. Another interesting fact was that, as the Dai Foundation mentioned, they helped us surface the need for a Mandated Actor, Recognized Delegate, and DAI Foundation offsite in the EU, around Amsterdam. We\u2019re working on getting that organized.   Growth  Nadia 31:04  Growth @ ETH Denver960\u00d7540 134 KB   Hey everyone. We had an incredible time. Conferences are always intense; while we tried to spend time with the Maker family, we discussed different ideas with partners and potential partners. I will not talk about some of these considerations until we finish working on them. We thought a lot about the multi-change strategy, and now that is one of our main objectives for Maker Growth; to help Maker with that. Everything we are doing is with that objective in mind. It is the first time I have seen that many new faces. It was packed with people, all of them interested in learning more about Maker.  It was also interesting to see how people who attended the Real-World Finance side event were keen on finding ways to interact and integrate with Maker to get a loan from us. People also showed interest in working with us, which was great. After I participated as a speaker in ETH Denver, I talked about Maker Growth and how we want to incubate the Marketing Core Unit, and many of them reached out to cooperate with us in this project. There was also a girl from Tik-Tok asking me if we were interested in collaborating with them.   I\u2019ve noticed, and it is something to work on for the next event, that new people did not know that Dai is a part of Maker. I\u2019m aware we do not have a Marketing team, but we have to clarify that Maker and Dai are not separate things. We had different internal meetings. One of the most important was with Oasis and Protocol Engineering to talk about institutional votes.  We are planning to partner with Oasis for the front end of a new service we will offer.   I want to thank David for helping me organize the dinner with other Mandated Actors and Delegates. It was the first time we had done something like that.  We had the opportunity to discuss different strategies in the Forum: Maker burn, surplus buffer, multi-change strategy, and how to scale Maker. It was great. We need more of these conversations.   We also collaborated with other Core Units in creating the Maker Party, Daivinity, which was awesome.  We had a church covered with the Maker brand and Dai logo. You can watch the video on Twitter. I want to thank everyone involved: Protocol Engineering, the Oracles, the Oasis team, part of my team also collaborated. Everyone did an amazing job at organizing this party. We would like to repeat the experience in the future, so stay tuned for that.     David Utrobin 35:25  I also want to express enormous gratitude for Strategic Happiness. Although we did not have a formal sponsorship at ETHDenver, the incredible amount of MakerDAO hats, and Burban organized and ordered in partnership with Kat, was mind-blowing. There were four times more people at ETHDenver than the last one I was at, and Maker had a huge presence: one in every four people was wearing one of our hats.  Nadia: You\u2019re right, David, I forgot about that. I\u2019m still receiving messages from people on LinkedIn or Twitter telling me they have a Dai beanie. Thanks to Strategic Happiness for that.     Discussion: Service-Provider CoreUnits  David Utrobin David Utrobin 36:41  Welcome to the discussion segment. Today, we will be taking on a topic recommended by JustinCase, a recognized delegate here in MakerDAO. The main questions are:   1920\u00d71080 228 KB   Since MakerDAO lacks a formal, centralized power structure, and no CU can impose their standards on others:  Is the DAO equipped to work with service-provider CUs? Is the DAO ready to deal, use and listen to the advice of service-provider CUs? How should CUs interact with each other to gain trust and provide value? Can CUs serve other protocols? How can we work together and have a buy-in around the various types of work we do?     1920\u00d71080 236 KB   Here is a list of the 21 CUs. These are like independent teams that each do their scope of work. Risk team, for example, produces assessments on various levels. GovAlpha makes recommendations on governance issues and moderates and mediates the governance side of Maker. GovComms does a lot of the communication side of things and recommendations. It is a service-provider CU. SES, to an extent, also is another service-provider CU. Several of the CUs in this list are very much in this service-provider category. If you would like to further elaborate on the topic, Justin, that would be cool. I would also love to hear what other CUs have done to produce buy-in around their initiatives and recommendations.  39:04  JustinCase: The reason I brought this up is that we are recently about to onboard a few CUs that are more explicit in their support function. We can do some kind of test: if you remove the other CUs, will this CU still make any sense? And the less sense it makes without other CUs, the more of a support CU it is, as far as I can tell. And the reason is that some CUs might get a role where they should try to make standards for all the CUs, and the only way to be successful in that endeavor is if you have earned the respect of the DAO as a whole; since we do not have a formal power structure, you need to be recognized by the community by bringing value to the table. I also think onboarding these kinds of CUs takes a little more effort from the community. We need to show their need because if the community does not support them, they will fail. I do not believe in onboarding CUs that are set up to fail, which is why I wanted to bring this topic to a wider discussion.  40:48  Payton Rose: Awesome. It makes the most sense to pause there and see any questions about the topic or the scope before we get too deep into it. So far does not seem like it. Well, in that case, the floor is open.  41:35  David Utrobin: I think that a big key to working cohesively together as a DAO is communication. I have observed in cross CU initiatives that - whoever is leading them - there is not a lot of consideration; an important work item gets put on the table with not too much regard for other teams\u2019 bandwidth. I think this happens because there is so much stuff happening, and often things are slow to get moving because everybody has to take time to digest what is being proposed to come up with a sensible and thoughtful position before engaging. And that just takes time. I think communication, lead times, and CUs who want to put forward standards have to make a very case for that standard and also have to do a lot of priming work before making it public.  42:57  Robert Jordan: One of the things I want to comment on is that decentralization does not eliminate the need for certain functions. If you look at a centralized organization, certain people or groups are needed for its success, and they are organized. In MakeDAO, you have what I call core CUs, and then you have the supporting CUs, and we need those supporting CUs. The easiest example: people and talent is our most important asset in a DAO, and that function somehow needs to exist. Each of you can decide whether or not the current CU that is being proposed is the one to do this, but we need that function. So there is a necessity, and decentralization does not eliminate that necessity. I support having these supportive organizations and do not feel anybody is forcing me. I have a choice as a facilitator to use or not to use those services. My stance is: let me, partner, where I can, and where I can not. I will have to do it on my own, but I prefer to partner and collaborate.  44:30  Niklas Kunkel: I like what Robert just said: many of these services are necessary. And so it does make a lot of sense to have a CU focus on them to solve the problem once rather than having each CU spending a bunch of resources on their own solving the same problem. I also want to reinforce that CU should not be forced to use a certain solution. If a solution is good, it will prove itself over time to be good, and you will naturally gravitate towards using that solution. One example I like to bring up is Accountable: I do not think it is a CU, but it is a service that many CUs use because it is useful. CUs are not forced to use Accountable, but in the end, many of them do because it is a good service.  45:41  Mariano Ventura: Thank you. There have been a lot of discussions around our \u2014Maker Talent\u2019s\u2014 relevancy and if the setup was correct. The first thing we need to consider is that we are learning how to create supporting functions CUs. And what I noticed, being a new member of MakerDAO, is that we are too afraid of losing our independence and our capacity to work autonomously in the CUs. This sometimes leads us to think that any supporting function will take out this ability to work, instead of seeing us as a partner and seeing the supporting functions as someone that will help me perform better while taking off my desk things that are using a lot of my time. I think this is the first conversation we need to have before seeing if a CU is prepared for success. Most of the CUs \u2014the ones we had so far\u2014 are focused on the product. It was easy to quantify: to give performance metrics, locate business plans, and sell quantity. But in this case, what we\u2019re talking about is people, and when I started, I realized that no one could use metrics to forecast what we need, the workforce we will need in the future. I will not just stand here watching because this topic comes from Maker Talent. This is the place for this relevant, healthy, and necessary discussion. We need a change of mindset here: supporting functions CUs will not force me to do things a certain way or will issue policies because this is not the approach that we want to have. We are prepared for winning because we want to see MakerDAO growing and performing. My best example is Governance, which is being responsible, acting professionally, and is gaining respect for what they do. Nobody thinks that Governance is taking out authority or facilitator\u2019s freedom. So I think that this is the best approach possible. We will not come and impose policies or force anyone to do anything. The best way is to let in anyone that wants Maker talent to perform and grow, and we will come up with a bunch of best practices, good examples, and success stories. The main thing is it will be optional. We are not planning to force anyone to use it or to resemble the typical HR department issuing policies that everybody will need to follow. This is not what a DAO is meant to be, and this is not the right approach either.  49:40  JustinCase: I want to echo some of the sentiments that have already been provided. It is very important to retain different CUs\u2019 autonomy, and I envision these services as advisory service providers. Different CUs can choose whether they want to use them or not. At the same time, we must have a realistic expectation that they will be chosen to be used; otherwise, it does not make sense to onboard them. It takes quite some time and resources to do the onboarding process while provoking expectations in whatever CU we are onboarding. It is really bad for everyone involved if we have to offboard a certain CU after six months because the larger community decided not to use this service. So, while I believe in the voluntary bit of this, I think we should have some sort of temperature measurement in the community, whether this is something they believe in or are willing to try. We do not want to force this on anyone, but we need to openly ask that question before we approve such CUs. MakerDAO is getting to the point where we are large enough to need specialized knowledge in other fields, rather than just our Core operating fields. We need an expert at talent, marketing, accounting, legality, and all these other classical support functions you find in a large corporation. But for them to thrive in a decentralized environment, we need to have a certain expectation that the larger community will use them.  51:53  Mariano Ventura: A chat discussion asks if this should be optional. I mean by \u201coptional\u201d is that we will not force you to use a CU you do not want. We are trying to align ourselves and do everything in the same direction to improve scalability and provide MakerDAO with a framework. Are we providing a compensation frame for facilitators to use? Of course. But if you want to use something different, you can always pay your vendors. And if you want to use different services, go ahead and do it. We want to be relevant for all the DAO. We want to provide a compensation framework, job evaluations systems, an induction system for everyone, etc. We are not prepared for outsiders who do not want to use it, but we want to be relevant for those who want to be aligned and see MakerDAO growing. Of course, there will always be someone that does not want to use your system. We need to discuss how the DAO will be managed in the future and what happens if we have a CU that does not want to get aligned with us. We need to have processes for that. But let us now set up a difference between being optional and letting other CUs not be aligned. We are spending money and resources to bring more success and practice. For example, we are going to need aligned practices in marketing. Does this mean that CUs can not use their marketing resources in the future? This is a conversation we need to have in the future. But this does not mean that \u201coptional\u201d means \u201cirrelevant.\u201d  54:55  Unknownspeaker: We need to support CUs, particularly those CUs related to legal issues. In SES, we think MakerDAO needs many legal CUs, and SES plans to incubate a series of legal CUs. However, we have to be very careful scoping the mandate. This new legal supporting CU must not have decision authority over other CUs. We need legal support, but we do not need the type of legal support that a centralized company or traditional legal counsel has. The most relevant point is that each CU should be responsible and accountable for its own decisions. If you have supporting legal CUs, the services of this CU should be only on demand and not mandatory. We must not create \u2014with this supporting CUs\u2014 hierarchies or points of centralization or types of control elements. To avoid this, we will need principles to guide the process.  56:08  Juan: I think that this is a feature of a DAO. When you are in a normal company, the top boss might usually mandate you to fill out a form to experiment with a new optimization tool. This might suck. Your whole department might be stuck with it because someone in another department or some expensive consultant thought this great idea and that they will solve world hunger with this. When you are a CU, you are only accountable to the MKR holders. If you decide to serve other CUs, you need to consider them as users. You need to ensure their use of your services adds value to users and makes it so easy that they do not need to do much. Ideally, you need to provide a lot of value at very little cost, which could be time. It could be another Excel sheet that they need to form. This is a huge feature of the DAO. CUs designed to provide value to the DAO are quite powerful.  57:40  Payton Rose: Thanks, Juan. One question has surfaced related to these kinds of service CUs:  What happens if their service is not needed for a period of time?   A lot of these CUs are structured in a way that they have mandates to be doing at all times. However, if you base your deliverables on what other CUs need, there is a chance that those other CUs will not need your services for a period of time.  58:58  Payton Rose: There are many scenarios where you can not be relevant. For example, your CU can no longer be relevant for the business due to outdated technology. This is something that could happen to many CUs. In terms of talents, I have been in HR departments where we have been downsizing and where we have been doing loads of things not necessarily connected to hiring. This is one of the biggest challenges that we have. We need to stop thinking that HR is useless if we do not hire. This is the first thing that we need to remove from our current mindset. Talent is relevant, especially in bad times. When things are not going well, and you are not hiring, you are not scaling. This is when you need to think about what\u2019s failing within your structure, as people usually start leaving when you are failing to scale up. This is when talent is relevant again to identify why people are leaving, why the current structure is not functioning, and why we fail in our people practices. What we need to take into account is that the business model can fail. If someone decides to leave Maker or fails to provide a good structure that responds to the market, talent will be relevant again. Usually, in the finance world, hiring is as simple as going to a newspaper posting an ad, and waiting for people to apply. What we are bringing here is much more than this.  1:04:59  David Utrobin: Teams at MakerDAO can greatly benefit from supporting function-core units. Not having to retain a talent pool, conducting one to three interviews, and assisting in creating job descriptions already offloads a lot of bandwidth and resources. Whether it is Talent, Strategic Finance, or SES, there is gain from having specialization in the DAO. Then, it is a matter of scaling. A support function that serves and provides value for 20 different teams is more efficient than all the teams. The main challenge is buy-in and the risk of onboarding a Core Unit that might not be very good at being a supportive function. For example, Content Production presented themselves as a supporting Core Unit, but as many people agreed, they did not deliver. The real challenge is clearly defining the scope upfront and the delivery.  1:06:28  Robert: Mariano, thanks for the prompt. This is what is challenging for me. I had some great conversations at ETH-Denver with some delegates about it. Our core units require a great deal of leadership and experience from their managers. I have yet to speak with all the facilitators and people involved, but my gut says we do not have a strong depth of experience with people hiring and managing teams in addition to building and leading companies. I have a background in startups and big companies and held many different roles. I see a people development function inside my Core Unit that is extremely important for my future. I have a few people, but I now have a vast organization. So, I am currently looking for some part-time help. Let us work together. I want to assess my team and provide tools. I love her post, but I do not know her name. However, the V18 team and Asia talked about employees and a development perspective from the contributor viewpoint, which is so critical, right in the path that they may not follow. Every day, I keep this in mind when I think about hiring because we hire people globally and retain talent. It is critical for me because I have been there many times before. Others may or may not see its importance until a Core Unit needs some assistance with specific issues. So, I want to throw that lens of perception out there. I intend to use it. I will turn to Mariano and ask tools, systems, or processes are you putting in place? How can I plug into that? I want to make sure my contributors on my team have that as a resource available to them because I want to retain people. It is that simple.  David Utrobin: Being young and not as experienced as you, Robert, filling gaps for experience is very relevant to me as a people manager. It is helpful when I have other people and the DAO to call upon for help.    1:09:13  Mark: I have some brief comments now that relate to my Core Unit and my hiring experience for the new Strategic Finance team in the past few weeks. By and large, there is a higher requirement to be deeply involved in the community to build trust and relationships with people from scratch for a support type function. Last April, I came on board the DAO as an investor and started pitching out part-time. It slowly ramped up and built trust over time. That is tough for other Core Units that do not organically do this. From a talent perspective, my thought was: do I trust this person to hire for my team? I do not know anything about them. I have not had any conversations with them. Ultimately, my decision was no. I decided to use Bankless for my Core Unit, which others are using as a hiring board for crypto. It filters out people that are not natively interested in crypto. In my experience, it has been highly beneficial to understand the candidates out there when making my job descriptions, interviewing people, and doing screenings. It also helped me better understand what we want for our team. For basically $750 per candidate, I will probably have two full-time people hired in a few days. That is an inexpensive way of putting the profiles up there. Sebastian, Teej from RWF, and I have met and interviewed candidates. For now, I do not see a need to change my process. We are getting talent.  Mariano: There are other essential things in terms of retaining people. For example, have any facilitators set up for your team members a career plan? Do they know what they will be doing 6, 12, or 18 months in the future? Are we able to offer something for them to retain themselves? Are we having feedback meetings to know what technologies our developers want to work with? These frequent questions concern the admin side of recruitment and the retention side of career plans. Xray revealed that people are not usually leaving for money but instead leaving because of career plans or to work on their projects. We need to pay attention because some core units are not leaving space for these things to happen. I agree that it is helpful to get the market pulse regarding what Mark Phillips was saying. However, when you need to seek candidates for a miracle unit that has ten positions, you want to see six to seven candidates for each position. This is because there are many reasons why a candidate cannot be a match, such as a lack of full-time availability, salary conditions, or knowledge. It is important to have someone who filters those candidates and provides the ten you want. This does not mean losing the market pulse or not learning from outside. Having a talent department is not always about delegating and picking the people I work with. It is more like a partnership. What are the things you need? Where are we going to find them? Amongst these people, who are the best ones to phone screen to gradually go through the process? It is a team effort, so let us change that a support unit is merely picking the people we work with.    1:14:01  Niklas Kunkel: I want to bring the topic back to the general Core Unit services. People have talked exclusively in this column of talent. I want to describe that this discussion is a symptom of a much bigger issue that comes up frequently: a corporation versus a DAO. Although a DAO is more inefficient than a corporation, it is more resilient. DAOs are optimizing for resiliency, not for efficiency. However, a push-pull relationship in a DAO aims to negate those efficiency losses by constantly trying to win back the efficiency gains. And those tend to happen around centralization. If all these core units have this problem, let us have a Core Unit that provides the service to solve this problem for everyone. You have gained efficiency and lost resiliency because now you have this central point of failure. Paper Imperium mentioned in the chat that we should have a Banking Core Unit because it is hard for Core Units to get banking. Well, imagine if the Banking Core Unit gets picked off. Then suddenly, every Core Unit would lose banking at the same time. There is no right or wrong answer here where always say yes or no to service Core Units. However, I would like us to keep in mind their service. How big of an impact would it have on the protocol or the DAO? How debilitating would it be if that Core Unit was targeted? In some instances, we can live with those consequences. It makes sense to have a service Core Unit that provides that service. And in other cases, the threat that poses may not warrant the efficiency gain.  Prose11: In terms of reflection, Nik is built from the facilitator\u2019s perspective. You have this interesting dynamic at play where you are responsible for the Core Unit. It is your little autonomous organization within itself. If it is not performing, you can be offboarded or face other consequences. Even if you are willing to lean on a service unit, it is with the understanding that their job still needs to be done if they cannot do it. So, in many ways, it becomes a harder sell for facilitators. However, a benefit of delegation is using less brainpower and labor. That is a win for the DAO.    1:17:41  Mariano: There is an interesting conversation in the chat about the daily tasks needed to retain people. Of course, this topic is not black and white. We will not stop asking questions about retention because we have a support team and challenge the Core Unit. Supporting functions can provide help and human resources tools, new apps, and other things to help your platform. You may not know these things because it is not your core business. The idea is to bring value, not complete delegation. There is something in the middle, and every Core Unit\u2019s contribution level is different. All the positions that we closed since we started were different. Some wanted to do the full interview, and others did not. The great thing about the DAO is that everybody can choose the contribution level from the supporting Core Unit.  1:19:47  David Utrobin: I am curious to hear responses to Paper Imperium\u2019s points in the chat. Support CUs could break away, and you would still be responsible. There is some resiliency there, but are there not irreplaceable core units like Oracles and the engineering teams? It is a huge risk if they fail or are underperforming.  1:20:25  Juan: We tried to make every single point of failure disappear. That is how you fully decentralized; this is the objective. A shameless plug: there is a call in the status update for SES at 3:30 UTC for three new tracks we will be releasing. One of them includes outreach and has to do with Comms and Marketing. The other has more to do with transparency reporting. We are working closely with Strategic Finance to make that better. And last one deals with legal risks in many ways. How do we deal with those risks? And how do we make sure that Maker is even more decentralized and avoid having this point of failure?  1:21:38  David Utrobin: We need to incentivize graceful offboarding in CUs, especially if there are many dependencies. This could be through MKR compensation packages that continue to vest if you gracefully wind down your Core Unit. I saw that in the GovAlpha MKR budget proposal. There are other mechanisms to minimize centralized points of failure in major core units. To Long\u2019s point in the chat, if GovAlpha drops off the map, the processes are written down in the MIPS. Anyone can operate the governance processes well enough to recover. We are trying to do something like this at GovComms. We make all our documentation public. We do not want the function to disappear if we are voted out. We hope that somebody can take our work and make it better. But at a minimum, we do not want to have a silo of the information or our processes. We want to make it so that we are replaceable. This is not great for the security of our team in terms of our positions here. However, the DAO needs to have open-source projects to make documentation around various functions available. Part of that is accounting standards, cross-team knowledge, and team-specific knowledge.  Mariano: We have started a communications plan to talk with facilitators about their concerns. If we go through another voting cycle, the communications plan may change. There are no concerns about the roadmap. We agreed that most of the touchpoints in our MIP are necessary. The level of adoption is the challenge here. This is what we will be working on for the next cycle.    1:24:46  Nadia Alvarez: What happens if only one CU uses the support service? Is that okay? Or is the idea for most CUs to use that service? We need to answer that before we onboard a new support Core Unit. If we have the freedom to decide the service providers we want to use, what is the objective for the DAO in onboarding the support CU? Is it to be used by one CU, all of us, or half of us? When does it make sense to onboard it or keep it as a service provider?  Mariano: Are we tackling our daily problems? Are we working on issues that we commonly understand need to be addressed? Having metrics for compensation, hiring, and onboarding people in the future will make our lives easier. It will also make our scaling processes easier. We all agree on that. Then, the discussion focuses on the project quality that makes you use these services. You will not be providing different projects to different Core Units. Instead, we must ask additional questions. Do we have a problem with salaries in terms of how we hire? How efficient are we in hiring intelligent people into the DAO? If we all agree on the issue, the supporting CU is relevant. Otherwise, it does not make sense. So, the question is, are we working on relevant projects? Are we addressing real problems that we are having? If all the facilitators agree on that, then it makes sense.     Conclusion  Payton Rose  It has been an excellent discussion here today. I do want to be mindful of everyone\u2019s time, though. Keep these discussions and ideas going in the forum. That is the best place to debate these things for the long term, share ideas, and learn. So thank you, everyone, for joining us on this covered service call. And we will see you again next week, same time.

To set the stage: ETH is our core collateral asset, but the expectation is that \u2014over time\u2014 a lot of that is going to move to staking and particularly to liquid staking solutions that still let you transfer it or use it in DeFi while you are staked. Staked ETH from Lido is the first large-scale solution; it is very liquid and has a large supply. So we are beginning to see lots of DeFi integrations and how that is being used. If we can closely follow these trends and see what our best move is, I think that\u2019ll set us up for success as we transition to proof-of-stake.    15:15  Leveraged stETH Yield960\u00d7540 44.9 KB    monet-supply: How stETH has it been used lately? It has primarily been sitting in the curve pool.  A few months ago, MakerDAO was the first lender to integrate it, and we have seen a decent amount of demand, between 100 to 200 million DAI generated from stETH. In the past month, Aave has also integrated stETH and shifted how it has been used besides showing a significant increase in DeFi usage. Up until now, I think they have gotten over 1.5 billion in TVL of stETH deposited. Mostly it\u2019s being used to borrow ETH and not to borrow stable coins. If the rate of borrowing ETH is below the staking rate (which typically it is), you can end up getting a higher yield with limited price risk because they are both referencing ETH. So, we have seen a ton of people depositing stETH in Aave and borrowing ETH, leveraging up their yield. We are even beginning to see some tokenization of these strategies, which attracts the attention of Index Coop. There is even a sort of leveraged index: ETH Max Yield (ETHMAXY). It makes it accessible for small users who do not necessarily have the amount of money needed to do it themselves to participate in that. I am expecting that many other lending protocols will see the success and the usage Aave is getting right now and are probably going to follow along on this integration. So, we are likely to begin to see Compounds and RARI integrating with stETH and trying to get some of this leveraged staking business.    Some of the side effects of this:  It pulls up the deposit yield on ETH.  So, recently, we have seen on Aave that the ETH deposit yield has gone from 0% to maybe 0.5%. And that is likely to even increase further up to maybe 2%. So, for people using Aave to borrow stable coins, their effective costs have now gone down a little bit.   I think that is an effect that we are going to see probably across liquidity protocols like Compound and RARI: the cost of supplying ETH and then borrowing stable coin \u2014which is directly competing with us\u2014 is going down. That is one of the most immediate impacts we need to look out for.    18:18  Impacts/Taking Action960\u00d7540 59.6 KB    About impacts:  Higher ETH rates on lending protocols offset borrowing costs, but, on the flip side, it increases the risk you face of having some of your collateral decline in value if some of those stETH loans default \u2014 which is unlikely, but not impossible: Lido could face significant slashing or technical issues. It creates a little more differentiation between what Maker is offering: when your collaterals are with Maker, it\u2019s not being lent out to somebody, which is maybe safer.    Another big impact:  As Lido becomes more deeply integrated into all of these money markets and lending protocols, it increases the systemic level of risk that we should also be aware of and look out for. Like any D3M integrations, if protocols are using Lido substantially, this creates risk, and we could lose some money if Lido had issues through the D3M, not just to our direct exposure stETH that we have for a vault. If some people get too aggressive with trying to get the most yield, they could get liquidated due to the regular price variation for stETH. So, there is a little bit of potential for a liquidation cascade event, which is another risk factor for Lido to become a little more integrated.    Another thing to consider in the bigger picture is that it might not be healthy for one liquid staking provider to be so dominant in the market, and that is another consideration that Maker will have to look to overtime.   About some ideas for taking action:  How can we best take advantage of this staking leverage and this overall stETH demand?  We have the ability \u2014which a lot of other protocols like Aave and Compound do not\u2014to have multiple products for each asset. So, an idea like having a WSTETH-C vault with a higher liquidation ratio but a lower interest rate is an area where we might outcompete with other protocols. If we want to go a bit heavier on the risk but maybe be able to charge higher stability fees, we could integrate one of those leverage tokens, which is earning that sort of enhanced stETH yield. So, if you are earning an extra yield, maybe there is more willing to pay a higher rate on your loan. Then, other liquid staking solutions are coming up that are becoming more liquid over time, and we have the opportunity of exploring integration with them as well. Another way that we can roll with the punches here is by continuing to lean into our D3M integrations: they would benefit a little bit from the higher ETH staking or ETH supply yield on these lending markets, and that is another differentiation that Maker has because our collateral practices are less risky.      22:46  LongForWisdom: It is unclear how D3Ms benefit from increased ETH yield. Can you elaborate on that point?  monet-supply: The thesis is that if you are earning yield on your collateral, it works as offsetting the cost of the interest you are paying on your loan. If people on Aave are earning 1% or 2% on their ETH, they might be willing, in Equilibrium, to pay higher rates on their stablecoin loans. It could be beneficial. Maker might see stronger demand for borrowing Dai, even if our target rate for the D3M is somewhat higher. We would be able to earn a little bit more. That is the theory.   LongForWisdom: Thank you. If anyone else has questions or comments, feel free to address those written down, share your thoughts, or comment directly on the topics we discussed. Person 1: Excuse me if this is a question already answered. Regarding the staking of Etherium collateral on the future proof of stake, will that be done by Maker itself, or are you using services to run those validators?  monet-supply: Until now\u2013and, probably, in the future\u2013we have integrated only Lido, a liquid staking protocol. They handle arranging with validators to stake the ETH. They also have a tokenization and governance protocol to overlay it. There are other protocols in that space that we have not yet integrated. Rocket Pool is notable. I do not remember a few others. Most likely, it will be external to MakerDAO itself.   Person 2: How is the assessment of Rocket Pool looking? Is there more liquidity?  monet-supply: Interesting point. It is getting better. Rocket Pool just created a curve pool with incentives. A decent amount of liquidity has gone into it. They have not paired directly with ETH but with Lido\u2019s wrapped staked ETH. The benefit for them is that the cost of capital of putting money in that pool is lower because the entire amount of it is earning staking returns. Nevertheless, this makes it less reliable from a lender\u2019s perspective: What if Lido\u2019s staked ETH market blew out and suddenly there is a 10% discount? Rocket Pool will eat all of the discounts Lido has, plus anything else they have. If Lido experienced slashing or hacking, their liquidity would evaporate. It is getting better, but there are still caveats.    26:42  monet-supply: I have seen a comment in the chat about Rocket Pool having issues attracting node operators.  They have a very decentralized approach, but they are limited on the supply side, like Maker. They need to have people willing to run nodes, put up 15 ETH of their own, and potentially have RPL tokens to stake on that. It is tough to get a decentralized network of a group of stakers together. Person 1: It seems that the operation is much more involved than I had in mind. I think it is orthogonal to Maker\u2019s core business. Your strategy makes sense.   LongForWisdom: The question has come up a few times about whether anyone at Maker is considering running our own staked ETH token. Personally, it seems like too much work. As you say, it is orthogonal to what we are doing currently.  monet-supply: There are synergies, probably some Oracle elements involved, and other things as such that we already do. But it seems like many great protocols are currently in the full-time business of doing liquid staking. Focus is good.   Nadia Alvarez: What are the odds of people closing their current ETH positions to convert them to staked ETH and borrowing them at Aave, or even opening a Vault at Maker but with staked ETH? If that is a possibility, what can we do to prevent that?  Andrew Burban: If I had the option to leverage staked ETH, I would probably use that rather than Aave. The upside and downside are higher if you leverage against stablecoins than just against ETH. I think the true degenerates will probably stick to leveraging through Maker. We do not want delta neutral, but those who do most likely will be using Aave. Kirk: It is important to distinguish two types of borrowing against staked ETH. One is borrowing in stablecoin to leverage up against it. Whether people do that at Maker or choose Aave, we can benefit either way. If they do it at Maker we have got a Maker Vault. If they want to leverage up with stables on Aave, we have to turn the D3M up and make sure Dai is the cheapest stable for them to use to get a loan. The flip side is that Aave allows\u2013and Maker does not offer\u2013collateralizing staked Ether or borrowing ETH against to swap to more staked ETH. That is very different. You are going along the yield. Like monet-supply said, that might cause people to tolerate slightly higher borrow rates for stables against ETH because of the yield they can get through that mechanism. But that is another type of market demand. On the one hand, you want to go along with the underlying asset. On the other hand, you only want to exploit the yield. Those are two different classes of people or market participants.    31:42  monet-supply: I will echo Brian\u2019s comment in the chat. On a strict basis, staking ETH and getting yield sounds better than just holding regular ETH, but the risk profile differs. Our standard ETH-A type Vaults might see people transition to either put their ETH on Aave and get 2% yield or put it in Lido and then borrow and get 4%. Despite this, there will always be a place for people who want to keep their collateral as secure as possible.  It is almost an advantage for us because our ETH Vaults become unique compared to Compound and Aave and all the other liquidity protocol style projects. Primoz: I can also say that half of our yielding loan book consists of institutions, such as Nexo and Celsius. They are refinancing their loan book, basically making a spread on it. Since they currently deal with ads directly, they probably feel safer here than at Aave. If one of these big institutions should start borrowing at Aave, even with regular ETH, they will be indirectly exposed to staked ETH because much of the ETH supplied is now borrowed and collateralized by staked ETH. That is another layer of risk that might not be acceptable for everybody. Person 1: I cannot substantiate this, but in my opinion, it would be good to differentiate between saying \u201cthis is a less risky approach\u201d and \u201ca reduced Premium is acceptable.\u201d From a market perspective, it makes sense to have a differentiated approach compared to what others are already doing. Nadia Alvarez: In the end, if you think about the risks of staking ETH, it is the same as Wrapped Bitcoin. Nexo and Celsius are holders of Wrapped Bitcoin. I do not see them caring that much about converting their ETH to staked ETH, right? monet-supply: You are right, Nadia. There is that risk. But there is even additional risk because the staked component can get slashed. If they are too heavy in one client, and it is a majority client or non-majority, if they accidentally have a configuration error on their side, they could instantly lose a third of their stack on some of their machines. The slashing is one of the most interesting and dangerous components that adds risk. It is not just a multi-sig. It is a machine with active keys running on it that is staking and could suffer any number of software faults. That is not even to mention Oracle pricing risk and other things, which are additional risks compared to Wrapped Bitcoin.    35:42  Person 3: Contrary to Wrapped Bitcoin, which only has BitGo as a custodian, staked ETH uses multiple node operators in smart contracts to balance between them. That is also something that is weighing down in the other direction.  Brian McMichael: It is important to note that staked ETH is running on a hot machine. The keys for the validations are on the machine, whereas, with Wrapped Bitcoin, they could go to a cold wallet that maintains the keys more safely. Person 1: When comparing staked ETH solutions, a simpler solution is less risky than what Aave is doing\u2014where the staked ETH risk is lending out defaulting loans. Keeping it simple and not multiplying the risk is differentiation from other protocols. monet-supply: We will get dragged in a bit with D3M if there is a massive collapse. That is worth considering. Primoz: Currently, we are not as exposed to D3M because the Dai market is somewhat isolated. Dai itself collateralizes all the Dai that is being borrowed. You have a huge percentage of recursive leverage position. For the other part, which is organically being borrowed and collateralized by crypto assets, its collateral consists mainly of regular ETH and Wrapped Bitcoin. We have not observed much staked ETH as collateral and Dai being borrowed. Of course, this would affect us. monet-supply: Yes. We should keep an eye on that. You are right. Maybe there is not plenty of room for Dai. If there was, we could offer the same type of incentive. Person 3: We also added the curve LP token, which offers the Lido rewards. It is not highly utilized now, but it can get to around the 6%. It can compete as well. Person 4: Good point. This might only be tangential, but we should talk about the general implications of the merge, moving to proof of stake, how the game-theoretical incentives of that proof of stake model have slowly started sliding into delegated proof of stake, and how there are negative centralizing effects on things\u2013such as stake death\u2013in the entire ecosystem. This could threaten the entire foundational level of moving to Ethereum and proof of stake. Since Maker runs on Ethereum, maybe we should think about those implications. In addition to that, there is this staking client validator diversity, which is another major issue. There is no incentive for validator diversity at the moment. These seem to be systemic-level risks for moving to proof of stake in a few months.    40:09  Person 1: What is interesting to me is how decentralization changes when applying proof of work, where a lot of the mining capacity is bundled in a couple of hands or mining pools.  LongForWisdom: Maybe it is not worth getting into fully for this call. monet-supply: Yes, but we are on a proof of work model. It works right now. We are moving to a proof of stake model. There are debates between proof of work, proof of stake, and the implications of the latter possibly becoming more delegated proof of stake/client diversity. We should have an idea of what those risks look like for the protocol. Maybe together with other top lending protocols, like Aave, Compound, and whoever else is integrating with these liquid staking derivatives, we have some leverage if we think development is not going in the right direction. It is worth our time to figure out the sustainable path for these systems and then try and align ourselves with that. Person 4: That is where I was headed with it. We do have some power to provide liquidity. For example, if we believe that Rocket Pool is better and more decentralized, maybe we would want to incentivize liquidity for that. There might be some actions that the protocol can take to help make the substrate it is built on top more resilient against the failure cases of proof of stake. Brian McMichael: For some context, we had the same discussions around Wrapped Bitcoin when we added it. There was not enough liquidity on the market, and it did not seem like it would be worth it for some people. Then we added it, and the liquidity exploded. We need to be worried about the tail wagging the dog with some of these analyses.   LongForWisdom: It may be worth discussing some of the possible actions, like money outlines. R/ETH was one of them, also onboarding the combined ETH/stETH/leverage yield thing. The other one was monet.  monet-supply: Yes. That was most of it. Other staking providers, most notably Rocket Pool, used the leverage tokens themselves, which in Equilibrium would have a 6% or 7% yield, instead of staked ETH having close to 4%. I think Rocket Pool is a tiny bit below that. The other thing is that we can have multiple products for staked ETH itself. We can have the C-type Vault with a high liquidation ratio but a relatively lower interest rate. We can have the B-type Vault that is somewhat inverse to that. We would want to be sure that we will get enough demand to make it worth our while. Nevertheless, we have the opportunity to differentiate our products more than most other lending protocols do. Onboarding the leverage tokens sounds good, but it is not that great of an idea. This leverage is taking Lido further into the lead, which may or may not be good\u2013probably leaning towards the , not side\u2013. It is also creating another risk: suddenly, there will be a billion dollars worth of force-selling if staked ETH ever gets back to a 5% discount. This could immensely blow the discount and be bad for us and everyone. If there is an idea that is not as good, it is most likely that one.   LongForWisdom: We might be coming to a natural end for the Staked ETH discussion. There is still a last chance if anybody wants to say anything related. Otherwise, we can move to open discussion. If anyone has more general questions or comments for the people on the call, feel free to speak up.   Open Discussion 45:52  Andrew Burban: Who is going to Amsterdam?  LongForWisdom: I am not sure. Person 1: I think I will go. I want to see the space built for the event. I will be in Austria before, so it will only take a short flight. We are thinking about going there and hanging out. Of course, it would be lovely to meet any of you there.   LongForWisdom: All right. I am not feeling any desperation to discuss anything presently. If there is nothing people want to bring up, we can finish earlier and give everyone 20 minutes of their time back.   Conclusion  LongForWisdom  It seems like everyone is happy. We will wrap up for this week, and we will join you again for the next one. The hope is we can have the on-chain collateral management initiative updates then. Also, more questions, answers, and status updates. Thank you, everyone, for coming.
