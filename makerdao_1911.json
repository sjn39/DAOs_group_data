                    "content": "Hey @ihsotas, thanks for the feedback! We know the importance of the Vietnamese and Indian markets for crypto, and we have spent quite a time on these markets in the past. Let me give you some context about what we have done (I think it\u2019ll be interesting for you and the maker community) and why you might perceive that we have reduced our efforts there: India. The cap gains tax of 30% on cryptos in India makes it non-profitable or extra difficult for traders to trade cryptos. And therefore we have to think out of the box, we have to generate different use cases other than just getting DAI on exchanges and then run marketing campaigns to promote DAI adoption, and it simply doesn\u2019t work that way. Indian tax regime, has pushed a lot of traders into decentralized exchanges. And so what we have been doing is to work with a few closer defi counterparts, for example, instadapp. We support them through a co-marketing campaign with them a few months ago: https://twitter.com/instadapp/status/1518989194735288320?s=46&t=n8tHBJZwujNMo5bU5UyWwQ. That\u2019s another reason why DAI volume is extremely low there, CEX are using for onramp and it\u2019ll always be better to do it with other stablecoins with higher liquidity. And we are also constantly looking for different use cases for India. For example, growth core unit has been in preliminary talks to a family office in India where they have close ties with some of the oldest banks and NBFCs (Non-banking financial companies) to finance pre-owned commercial vehicles, gold loans and home loans. And hopefully, we can replicate the same use case with HVB in India. But this all takes time. Vietnam. We have DAI listed on many exchanges in Vietnam. And in fact, most of them prefer to trade P2P. The most commonly used one is called Remitano and they\u2019re only listing the mainstream tokens. And Vietnamese users are generally speculative traders (very similar to the entire SEA). Inflation is 3.6% which is actually under control and considered the lowest in the entire SEA. People use stables because they don\u2019t trust the government there, not entirely because there is inflation. Inbound and outbound remittance is huge (the same goes for the Philippines) but that\u2019s something we haven\u2019t been able to tackle (as remittances are all about liquidity and infrastructure). And gamefi sort of fizzles out after the Ronin hack. And there isn\u2019t a lot of user growth on Axie after the hack. It would be interesting to find out what kinda games the Filipinos and Vietnamese are playing from the poster, if you could help us with this, that would be great. Generally speaking, our strategy has changed after the endgame plan approval, and that\u2019s why we are not attending to ETHIndia. As I said before, I really appreciate your feedback and would love to collaborate with you in the future with anything aligned with Maker\u2019s priorities. If you want to learn more about what we have done in these markets, please feel free to contact @joce_chang. ",
