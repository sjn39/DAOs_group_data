Paragraph Summary The Content Production Core Unit\u2019s initial budget provides three months of runway (May, June, July) to establish operations in accordance with our mandate. This proposal is for a total of 201,200 Dai to fund the team for August, September, and October. Unless the team significantly expands the scope of its activities, this quarter\u2019s budget should be ~50,000 DAI higher than a typical quarter due to the inclusion of a Continuity Fund to pay contributors in the event a budget is delayed or some other emergency occurs.  Quarterly Focus Our initial budget provides a three-month runway to get the Core Unit up and running. We\u2019ve shared our strategy and OKRs and once we\u2019ve onboarded all of our team members, the focus of our activities will include:  Updating the Community Portal  The Community Portal is our hub for educating people about MakerDAO and facilitate the publication of community-generated content. We\u2019re currently implementing a plan to transfer the domain from the Foundation to the community while preserving SEO and will update the content to make it more accessible.  Creating funnels for lead generation  Distributing content gives us opportunities to catch people\u2019s attention in different ways but that doesn\u2019t do us any good if those people don\u2019t know how to follow up on those opportunities. We\u2019ll be working to ensure the content on our web properties and social channels includes calls to action (CTAs) in our content wherever appropriate and is organized to prevent stakeholders from hitting unnecessary roadblocks.  Engaging the community  Once our web properties and social channels are primed for traffic, we\u2019ll be in a better position to focus on the best ways to drive traffic. We\u2019re encouraged by the enthusiasm toward a mascot and are proposing a Community Management Fund that will allow us to advertise specific initiatives, fund contests and community-generated content, and take advantage of other opportunities to engage superusers, build customer loyalty, and get people excited about MakerDAO.  Quarterly Budget (August/September/October) People There is no change in compensation for any contributors compared with our previous budget, however, we\u2019ve added a part-time role for design. We\u2019re waiting to see how the community proceeds with the MKR Compensation Plans before making any proposal regarding compensation in MKR.     Role Name     Full-Time    Facilitator @seth   Audio Engineer/Podcast Producer @JerryAG   Video Director TBD   Social Media/Community Manager TBD   Editor TBD       Part-Time    Designer aethermilk   Writer/SEO Specialist Tom DeMichele    Programs Community Portal Tech Support - 10,000 Dai - To maintain and upgrade the CMS of the Community Portal. Community Management Fund - 5000 Dai - For promoting AMAs on Reddit and taking advantage of opportunities to host contests, pay community members to write articles, etc. once we have the contributors to coordinate these activities. Admin Based on our current projections for startup expenses and hiring, we\u2019re aiming to retain at least 10,000 Dai from the Contingency section of our previous budget and plan to use those funds to cover any unforeseen expenses that may arise. Gas & Other We\u2019re asking for a month\u2019s worth of salaries (46,500 DAI) to be paid in the August budget distribution to provide a Continuity Fund in the event budget distributions are delayed and we need to pay contributors. This will go into a governance-approved multi-sig.
