Please read the below for context and background. PECU recognises the importance of growth through innovation and that the Spark Protocol via Phoenix Labs could be in a position to help future SubDAOs scale. This initiative seeks to draw innovation to the periphery of Maker, vs the stable core-code upon which Maker is based. The recent Spark Protocol MIPs have failed to seek approval from Governance to commence or dedicate technical resource to this initiative prior to the formal MIP passing. PECU is proposing the following to remedy the confusion and provide transparency for work that is happening now. PECU is requesting that the following resources be formally dedicated to Phoenix Labs:  1 full-time engineer (@hexonaut)  Funding will only be provided for February, March, and April. This is done under the assumption that a new PECU budget cycle and business entity will be sought from May 2023. At this point in time, Phoenix Labs and its technical team will have had sufficient runway to pursue their next steps independently. This request for 1 engineer to formally work for Phoenix Labs is being posted in parallel with this poll request (the team\u2019s code review of Spark Lend D3M implementation). Similarly, we hope  that a governance poll will be suitable for approval. ",
