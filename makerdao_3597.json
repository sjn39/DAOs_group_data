As an MKR holder and a proposed facilitator for the unit, I am concerned that the DAO faces a loud minority issue. And yes, it is me advocating for the unit our team has proposed. More importantly, it is also about the problem I see here as someone who has a stake in the well-being of the DAO. It is crucial to get your voice heard for sure, which is why I am in this space in the first place because of my strong belief in that. However,  the issue I find here is if someone doesn\u2019t understand what marketing is, then it is tough to get them to see why it is essential even when it is explained in simple terms. The same questions are asked repeatedly on the Forum, even after the answers are laid out clearly, and feedback is addressed in the proposal. For example, a question about our target audience is still being asked even though that\u2019s being addressed. If more elaboration is needed, why not directly ask from there? Ten days after, the same set of questions were asked again. Like any company or team, the Strategic Marcomms team is here to solve problems, precisely problems related to marketing.  And some people in the community understand that. How do we increase the awareness of Maker protocol and increase Dai adoption?    [Campaigning] Vote NO on \"Inclusion Poll for Strategic Marcomms Core Unit MIP Set - May 10, 2021\"   our core users are not small retail vaults and are unlikely to be so in the future.   One thing for sure, DAI is not just for large vault owners unless you see DAI as XRP.  That is also a very limited view of what MakerDAO is, in my opinion. The Moonshot fund is the solution to a problem that we seek to solve. It is an issue that we anticipate will arise, how we can solve the problem of keeping confidentiality while being able to act swiftly when opportunities arise as a DAO. In addition, 5 million DAI may seem like a lot for someone who doesn\u2019t know marketing or how an advertising campaign works. That level would seem just about right for those in marketing and advertisement as it is laid out in the budget proposal. Given all the explanation, if someone still doesn\u2019t see why it is needed at all, then let me ask: Ray Dalio explains in his book Principles of decision-making. When you have a question or a problem to solve, considering the best decision-making process, do you ask the credible person who knows the issues at hand? That is the question we as a DAO need to ask ourselves. ",

                    "content": "    Kathleen:  I am concerned that the DAO faces a loud minority issue   Just to address this, I don\u2019t think this is an issue. @PaperImperium is certainly loud and sometimes posts too much  but in this case, I think the issues being raised are reasonable. I say this as someone who started looking into this only after the campaigns were started. There is quite a large gap between the two sides and I hope we can engage on the issues itself. Here\u2019s my take on it - and it\u2019s only a single data point - but I think some of it will help close the gap between the two sides. I went through this thread and this one for a couple of hours and here\u2019s the issues that I find troubling.   Prior record It is claimed that up until now, a total of 10M DAI has been spent on DAI awareness with little to show for it. This is also raised by @PlanetX here. The question to ask is why is it different this time. What didn\u2019t work during the Foundation\u2019s time but will now?   The control over the 5M moonshot fund Your new thread proposing a multisig probably helps but the traditional operating practices involving NDAs and confidentiality do conflict with a DAO\u2019s modus operandi. I don\u2019t have a solution here but I am just pointing out that this is going to need some serious thought before you can find consensus. I understand your point of view that this is just how things work in your industry but we\u2019re in a hybrid situation here (a DAO doing traditional marketing) so it might need something unconventional. It seems like a square peg - round hole situation right now.   The budget size The moonshot fund is the biggest point of contention here. You did point out that this might be a marketing people vs non-marketing people issue. I fall in the latter category and indeed it seems like a very large budget to me. That said, I can imagine that this is normal for those with a different background from me. In any case, I still think it is important to show that such a budget is both normal and necessary to convince those without a marketing background. Without that conensus, it will be hard to move forward and appeal to authority cannot be a solution here. I think this would need a separate thread and I\u2019m happy to ask more detailed questions there, if you choose to create one. There is also this post by @Aes that, as far as I can see, was not answered.   I think it would help if you could address these points either here or in the \u201cNo\u201d campaign thread, where many of the same questions are asked. My personal opinion is that the proposal, in its current form, is not where it needs to be to achieve consensus but I don\u2019t think any of the the issues are insurmountable. Thanks for reading!

July 2020 One\u2019s favorite food campaign - one\u2019s favorite food in Japanese is Daikoubutsu. We ran this campaign after the restaurants started to reopen after the first wave of the pandemic. We asked people to show their support for their favorite restaurants by posting pictures of their favorite food on social media and the name of the restaurant and tag to #dai\u597d\u7269 (DAIkoubutsu). The participants got Dai in return. Then we shared how Dai can be used. Results: *1,400% surge of visits to our blog page for the campaign period. *The campaign generated 62.8K impressions on the campaign\u2019s tweets and replies, while #dai\u597d\u7269  had 251K impressions. September 2020 Where\u2019s Dai? (or dokoDAI) This campaign invites people to find or create things that consist of Dai or something that includes dai sound. We ask them to tweet it and tag it to #dokoDAI. After that, as a token of appreciation, we put all the submissions into a mosaic DAI. Results: The hashtag #\u3069\u3053DAI reached at least 160K of Impressions.

Saying that I\u2019m claiming it is \u201cprimarily the result of the marketing teams work\u201d isn\u2019t just putting words in my mouth, it is also fundamentally failing to understand the most basic economics of marketing. Marketing just need to have positive ROI, period. So when I called your bluff by linking to daistats, you cognitively dissonanced yourself into demanding a marketing team that \u201cprimarily drives the growth of the project\u201d. You could have an absolute shit project that is just limping off a cliff edge, yet technically it could have a marketing team whose work is \u201cprimarily behind 100% of the growth\u201d. It makes absolutely no sense. Marketing is about building upon and pushing all of the factors that drive growth. Again, it is about positive ROI by directing efforts and energy towards the key leverage points of the broader organic factors that drive growth. And yes it sucks the marketing team can\u2019t share much of the specific things they did since it was done while they worked for the Foundation, and the Foundation naturally always prioritizes not running afoul of the howey test (and no matter how much you complain this won\u2019t change because these people actually have the best interest of the project in mind). But you dont fire the marketing team of a project that got to 5 billion USD of demand unless your goal is to fail. ",

The Protocol is generating 200 million Dai per year in funding. We\u2019ll hit 10 billion Dai in 100 days and likely well before given the accelerating pace. I doubt anyone here would express surprise at the idea of a 20 billion Dai supply by the end of 2021 and the better part of a billion Dai in annual revenues. It\u2019s regrettable, if understandable, that more details of the Foundation\u2019s marketing successes can\u2019t be communicated.

If this proposal fails to pass, that does not equate to firing the marketing team. The DAO does not have, and has never had a marketing team, the Foundation does / did. If this proposal fails to pass, that indicates that the DAO is not willing to hire the Foundation marketing team on the terms they proposed. Now, that\u2019s obviously an unfortunate outcome for those involved especially if they made plans around this proposal passing before it was voted on. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate:  An unwillingness to work with this marketing team on other terms. An unwillingness to pursue marketing in general for the DAO.  The current state of the vote means exactly what it means and no more: that the terms of the current proposal are not viewed favourably.
