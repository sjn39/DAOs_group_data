                    "content": " Issue Accessing the Governance Portal through the (Gnosis) Safe multisig UI is currently impaired due to an issue with the \u2018Safe App\u2019 integration. You might run into something like this when trying to connect:  Screenshot 2023-02-16 at 16.55.081428\u00d7958 36.9 KB  TechOps (@techops-core-unit ) has identified a potential root cause and I\u2019ve relayed this to our connections at the Safe team. I\u2019ve also made sure to flag the importance of this fix in light of upcoming governance polls. We\u2019re striving to get the issue fixed as soon as possible. Until then, there is a workaround available!  Workaround A workaround for the issue is available which allows multisig operators to use the Governance Portal without any issues. It does take a few more steps compared to the native integration:  Step 1: Navigate to the (Gnosis) Safe webapp and connect your signer/owner wallet as usual Step 2: Navigate to \u2018Apps\u2019 Step 3: Search for \u2018WalletConnect\u2019 and click \u2018Open App\u2019 Step 4: Now open a new tab in your browser and navigate to the Governance Portal  Step 5: Click the Connect wallet button, and then the WalletConnect option. Click \u2018copy to clipboard\u2019 which appears beneath the QR code. Step 6: Navigate back to the Safe webapp browser tab and paste the contents in the text field Step 7: Verify that the correct wallet is connected to the Governance Portal  Apologies for the inconvenience and thanks to @rspa and @DAOstrat.C for their help during the investigation.
