Thanks for your kind words, although I can\u2019t take all the credit, multiple people provided helpful feedback on the proposals whilst they were being written. For the record, I\u2019m not discouraged. This is Governance in action, and the discussion has been respectful on the whole. If these proposals fail, we\u2019ve at least started a discussion, and hopefully, someone else can pick up the torch and make a better proposal which is acceptable to Governance. ",
