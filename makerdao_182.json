It contains:  Total MKR Expenditure Cap Estimated MKR Expenditure (based on the current team) Escrow Wallet mechanism  The IS Core Unit follows the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit (SES-001) proposal for MKR Vesting. MKR incentives have been determined based on the Program discussed here. This is a 3-year vesting plan with 1-year cliff vest. The IS core unit has been working under the incubation program of the SES since October 2021. The members of this core unit will take that as the start date for the vesting schedule.  Total MKR Expenditure Cap The total MKR Expenditure will not exceed 65.77 MKR. This covers the entire 3 years plan for 1.2 FTEs.  Estimated MKR Expenditure The Estimated MKR Expenditure is our best guess of how much MKR will be used with the current team configuration. Reasons why the Actual MKR Expenditure could rise closer to the MKR Expenditure Cap:  A raise for a member of the team New hires Repricing (and resetting) the program, in the case of bear market  Price floor: -30%. If any Contributor chose to reprice their program, they could do it at a maximum of -30% from the set MKR price.  Permanent Team Forecast For the permanent team, assuming the team configuration remains the same as today, this would result in the vesting schedule below.     Vesting Date MKR Amount     May, 2022 0 MKR   Dec, 2022 13.31 MKR   May, 2023 6.65 MKR   Dec, 2023 6.65 MKR   May, 2024 6.65 MKR   Dec, 2024 6.65 MKR   Total 39.93 MKR    This covers the total vesting schedule of 3 years for the current 1.2 FTEs. On average, this yields 11.09 MKR per FTE per year. Any changes to these amounts will be reported and reviewed by our budget auditors.  Parameters     Parameter Value     MKR/USD lock-in Price (New) Trailing 6 month average   MKR/USD lock-in Price (OG) MKR = $3784.77 (4/APR/21 - 01/OCT/21)   MKR Price Floor -30% ($2649)   Vesting Period 3 years   Cliff Vest 12 months   Vesting Schedule After cliff has expired, biannual MKR amount   Vesting Interval 6 months   Manual Repricing yes   Auto-Renewal yes     Payment Implementation This payment implementation is based on the SES MKR budget proposal  Payment of the MKR tokens will follow the same flow as described in DUX budget MIP  As defined above and in the Monthly Budget Statement will contain the MKR vesting schedule. This schedule specifies when in the future MKR is vesting, and how much. To keep the risk acceptable for Maker governance as well as for the team, the MKR is moved from the protocol to the contributors in stages:  Following the MKR vesting schedule, any MKR that is vesting in 6 months or less, will be included in the top-up transaction which is added to the executive vote. This will move the MKR from the protocol to the IS Auditors Wallet, which then acts as an escrow wallet. Following the MKR vesting schedule, after review and approval by the auditors, any MKR that is vesting in 3 months or less, will be included in the monthly top-up transaction that moves funds from the IS Auditors Wallet to the IS Permanent Team Operational Wallet. When the MKR has vested, it is paid out to the contributor, either directly or through an intermediate payment processor.   Any excess MKR in the IS Auditors Wallet or the IS Permanent Team Operational Wallet will be returned to the protocol, following the monthly payment transactions.  This payment implementation makes no assumptions about the origin of the MKR. It can either be moved from the protocol\u2019s treasury, newly minted, or obtained from another source. The MKR that\u2019s held by the IS Auditors Wallet and the IS Permanent Team Operational Wallet will not be used for voting, signaling, or any other type of governance participation. It will remain in the wallets untouched until it moves to the next step in the process. IS-001 may consider alternative payment flows compliant with DssVest if the standardized flow is compatible with the vesting schedule and that the risk is deemed acceptable by the team.

It will be kept up-to-date even after the publication and approval of this MIP.  Motivation With the extensive growth of the DeFi ecosystem, as well as crypto as a whole, comes greater threats. Though a significant increase in both community sizes and funds within the ecosystem indicates a maturing environment, the glitter of success also attracts nefarious individuals and groups seeking to damage the ecosystem in exchange for their own personal gains. While some aspects of cybersecurity within the space are well-known, primarily software audits, the shift in the ecosystem indicates a need for more proactive as well as reactive measures. With MakerDAO not only being one of the largest ecosystems in the space but also a pioneer in the push for decentralization, it is a prime target for these nefarious people. We wish to prevent, or, at the very least, minimize the negative effects of their intended actions.  Mission Systematically improve security for builders, end users, and other stakeholders in the Maker Ecosystem by providing both reactive and proactive security services.  Vision A Maker ecosystem with the right security measures, including regular self-evaluation for constant improvement, in order to allow the ecosystem builders and users to focus on innovation and adoption. This is achieved through:   Security Operations   Identification of Critical Infrastructure - A comprehensive list of critical people and infrastructure for the Maker ecosystem and metrics that need to be tracked in order to identify the areas needing focus and have proper monitoring implemented.  Bug Bounty Program - An industry-leading bug bounty program to adequately incentivize whitehat hackers to look for vulnerabilities in the Maker codebase as well as blackhat hackers to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities instead of exploiting them.  Incident Response Facilitation - A refined set of \u201cWar Room\u201d procedures and resources to minimize damages to the Maker ecosystem in the event of a successful attack.    Community Support   Core Unit Operational Audits - The creation, implementation, and regular evaluation of secure operational procedures for key Core Units to minimize attack opportunities.  Education and Advisory - Create security resources available to all Core Units and the wider Maker community, as well as provide on-call security advisory services to foster a culture where security is taken more seriously     Core Unit ID IS-001  Core Unit Name Immunefi Security  Core Unit Mandate The overall goal of the Immunefi Security CU is to secure the Maker ecosystem through multiple angles by leveraging its existing and growing security community and expertise. This involves dedicated services to the Maker ecosystem, effectively establishing a security partnership with the DAO. The CU will also aim to complement and collaborate with existing and future CUs instead of competing with them, leveraging existing processes, infrastructure, and information, among others, in order to deliver greater value to the Maker ecosystem. As a pioneer in the DeFi space with billions in funds in the protocol, the Maker ecosystem is an attractive target for blackhat hackers who look to steal funds or disrupt the protocol. With millions lost regularly in the cryptocurrency space, it is likely that the Maker protocol, its key people, and its key infrastructure, are targeted on a regular basis.  Identification of Critical Infrastructure To ensure that the right areas are covered by the services of the Immunefi Security CU, the CU will need to regularly identify the critical areas of the Maker ecosystem, including key people, infrastructure, and processes. The CU will create metrics that need to be tracked for each of them. It will then coordinate with other CUs to leverage existing monitoring tools, and coordinate the creation of new tools for uncovered areas that are deemed critical. Where deemed necessary, the CU will create backups as well as provide necessary support for the upkeep of these tools. Throughout this time, the CU will ensure that the other CUs are aware of all dependencies that we have with them, and the reasons for their importance. The CU will also identify critical security dependencies across CUs throughout its investigation and surface these dependencies to the relevant CUs. The identification for need and establishment of secure communication channels will also be covered under this service.  Bug Bounty Program The Immunefi Security CU will orient its growing community of security researchers on the Immunefi bug bounty platform towards the Maker ecosystem. Leveraging its expertise with bug bounty programs across the cryptocurrency space, especially the DeFi ecosystem, the Immunefi Security CU will create and propose a bug bounty program to economically incentivize further investigation of the code. The program will attract whitehat hackers who find vulnerabilities and responsibly disclose them, so they are fixed before they can be exploited. Additionally, this provides an incentivized opportunity for disclosure of vulnerabilities instead of exploitation for blackhat hackers. In order to achieve this, the Immunefi Security CU will:   Coordinate with various CUs in order to identify the scope of assets as well as impacts to ensure that bugs reported are those that are valuable to the ecosystem.  Maintain the program by incorporating additional content where needed, such as additional requirements for submissions, restrictions, and information, adding and removing scope as needed, and including various improvements from knowledge gained through the operation of the overall Immunefi platform. If necessary, the Immunefi Security CU will create separate bug bounty programs for different areas, for example smart contracts vs. cloud infrastructure.  Triage all vulnerability reports and escalate to the appropriate CU as needed.  Publicly report all critical vulnerabilities after all fixes have been implemented and verified in the format of a postmortem, and respond to inquiries from the community.  A subproposal will be created for the bug bounty program as well as a separate budget subproposal due to the unique process complexities for this.  Incident Response Facilitation Even with an effective Bug Bounty Program and appropriate incentives in place, there are always those who don\u2019t care about these incentives, or believe that they can get away cleanly with more funds than the bug bounty program reward. This is why the Maker ecosystem should still be prepared to react appropriately in the event of a serious successful attack. The Immunefi Security CU will collaborate with other CUs, such as the GovComm CU, to create a War Room of on-call members, both from within and outside the Maker ecosystem. This will provide the necessary support in order to minimize the impact of the attacks.   Technical experts to act on and validate successful attacks as well as assist in fixes as necessary.  PR specialists to take a proactive role in framing the perception of the exploit in a constructive manner, with the appropriate legal review of public statements.  Community coordinators to assist existing community organizers and managers in dealing with the immediate aftermath of the exploit.   Core Unit Operational Audits - Full Spectrum Security Service In addition to software and public network security, operational security also needs to be considered due to the many other attack vectors that exist. This is why the Immunefi Security CU will provide operational audits to selected CUs in the form of a Full Spectrum Security Service. The service first identifies the key areas that need focus, and what needs to be done to address them. Within three months, the Immunefi Security CU will then review the changes that were made by the audited CU, and make further recommendations where needed. After this initial review, regular quarterly reviews will be conducted (1) to ensure that existing security practices are still being followed, and (2) to update the recommendations based on the most recent available information. Throughout this process, Maker will be given access to the world class security expertise in our network to source the best solutions to its security problems. In order to achieve this, the Immunefi Security CU will:   Connect with CUs that need the service and coordinate with each of them directly with appropriate prioritization, based on information acquired during the \u201cIdentification of Critical Infrastructure\u201d section.  Assemble the team and support structure required to execute the service at the desired level.  Review changes implemented after three months to determine if the right modifications were done and if further modifications or actions are required.  Create a handbook that can be referenced by these CUs to incorporate into their emergency response operations as well as day-to-day safety procedures.  The audits include, but are not limited to:  Threat assessment Private Key and multisig management Securing the development pipeline and infrastructure Physical security and key personnel security policies Communications, operations, and information security Incident response procedures relevant for the CU Secure software and hardware recommendations  A subproposal will be created for the Core Unit Operational Audits - Full Spectrum Security Service  as well as a separate budget subproposal.  Education and Advisory As a last pillar of our strategy, the Immunefi Security CU will provide educational resources and on-call advisory, especially those for areas not covered by the Full Spectrum Security Service.   Provide content that is accessible to the wider community, including resources for end users, with prioritization determined after getting feedback from other CUs  Conduct live seminars and workshops for Maker ecosystem projects and CUs, with a focus on smart contract security, including bringing in experts from the wider ecosystem to provide up-to-date security information.  Be accessible to all Maker projects and CUs for advisory on security-related matters in the form of an open questions and answers channel as well as an office hours call twice a month.  Collaborate with CUs that need to provision security processes, such as the SES CU when new CUs are being onboarded.   Deputy Facilitator In addition to a Facilitator, this Core Unit will be having a Deputy Facilitator who will engage in multiple areas of the Core Unit operations and will act as a representative. The responsibilities of the Deputy Facilitator will be growing over time as the Core Units operations gets established. A job description of the Deputy Facilitator role can be found here.

Can the community expect White Hat attacks (fire drills) from this CU?  They wouldn\u2019t be white hat attacks per se, though the bug bounty program would encourage whitehats to look at the code. However, a fire drill will definitely be in place here with the first one set for February 2022.

How the bug reports affecting other protocols will be handled will be addressed in the separate bug bounty MIP as well. And again, thanks for pointing this out - definitely will need to address this.

Again when these CUs come on board that have functions heavily overlapping other CUs (almost being duplicated) I want to hear from the CUs where this overlap is strong about how this benefits them or whether they see issues etc. @Derek feel free to comment here as I see Security as PE domain.  I want to know if PE plans to offload security issues to this CU or whether this in fact will be a duplication of effort.   When it comes to security I want not just 2 but potentially 3 teams looking at this given the importance.  I do not want to get into a situation where we have a security event/issue and 2-3 CUs basically pointing at each other saying \u201cit was their responsibility to catch this\u201d. When it comes to this kind of responsibility overlap I want a strong statement from CUs what is and what is not their responsibility.  Because if all adding CUs is going to do is basically dilute responsibilities without giving Maker Quality Assurance and at least \u2018some duplication\u2019 of seriously important core functions I am going to start questioning the addition of these as beneficial to Maker in terms of what we get for what we are paying for. I am going to abstain until I hear something from @Derek regarding what the addition of this CU means for PE security functions and where security responsibilities will lay with or without the addition of this CU.

Let me first refer to the vision of this proposal and assess where it does or does not overlap with the Protocol Engineering Core Unit from my perspective. Regarding Security Operations, PECU:   (1) Does not manage an operational list of individuals/infra considered to be critical or any metrics/monitoring around this. (we do run keepers though, more on that below).  (2) Does not actively manage a bug bounty program - although we do review reports, perceived threats and write responses where needed.  (3) Does participate in war rooms and technical threat responses due to our unique knowledge of the protocol. We are a critical component in any of these meetings.  Regarding Community Support, PECU:   (1) Does not audit other Core Units in their operational security behaviour. As an independent CU, we manage and implement our own operational security practices and procedures only.  (2) Does and is working towards creating technical security resources and supporting smart contract documentation. I would argue that our role is more of a technical specialist focus as opposed to operational advisory.  Regarding critical infrastructure:  PECU, TechOps and others run keepers to ensure auctions get kicked off when required, that oracles are poked on time etc. Some of this is probably tribal knowledge, some of it on R/C, some in docs.makerdao etc - I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a comprehensive list detailing all ancillary components (monitoring, keepers, circuit breakers etc) of the protocol. I consider PECU a critical part of that infrastructure, but I don\u2019t see us as owners of this.  Regarding a bug bounty program:  Maker has always run a bug bounty program. I think it makes sense for this to continue as we scale to new non-standard collateral types and potentially new tokenomic designs.  Incident response facilitation:  I can see value from an operational perspective, but there is an overlap with PECU where PECU will likely remain the lead as the technical experts. This also intersects (at least in my understanding) with our relationship with industry auditors. I raise this question in the Core Unit Budget Thread   How is PECU different from the Immunefi Security CU: In the context of security, the PECU focuses on:  Formal verification Economic modelling of new financial mechanisms Open source tooling development Providing audit-like capabilities, reviews and assessments of a technical nature \u2026and much more, but consider that as a high level take  What does this proposal mean for PECU:  It will be essential to integrate existing and new technical experts into war rooms, pager duty, technical assessment activities. \u2026keeping in mind the next point;  What am I cautious about - the bureaucratic (structural?) overhead that more teams introduce - however this is a natural evolution for all growing start-ups. Also, what is the overlap (or is it complementary) between proposed infrastructure groups like TechOps etc. In conclusion, I do not see PECU offloading any of its existing security tasks because our focus and skill set is not so much operational as it is focused on research, tooling, modelling work, and technical risk assessments.

You\u2019re welcome @Derek and thank you for the detailed reply.   forums are getting to the point I am missing stuff and only catch things now if I am actually pinged with a reference.     wouter:  Agree with @Derek that there is practically no overlap with PECU. There could be some overlap with Techops. So this needs to be coordinated and these conversations are already going on to avoid double work.   Showing what I don\u2019t know about where the authority/responsibility CU structures going on.   Making me think we need a kind of Maker CU authority/responsibility map so we can see the total area Maker is responsible for and then lay out the pieces so we can see where functions overlap and where there might be gaping holes.     Derek:  What am I cautious about - the bureaucratic (structural?) overhead that more teams introduce - however this is a natural evolution for all growing start-ups. Also, what is the overlap (or is it complementary) between proposed infrastructure groups like TechOps etc.   Thank you for this comment Derek as it supports my general feeling as we get more CUs that we don\u2019t have a decent functional structural diagram typically called an Org Chart in most companies that laid out departments, positions and organizational structure (who reported to whom and what the chain of command was). Probably even more important to construct such a chart for Maker. Thank you both Derek and wouter for responses.  So my take away from your comments is that since this CU doesn\u2019t have much overlap with other CU functions we probably need it and where it does overlap we do want some additional eyes. Last time I looked around (when I found an issue in the system) it was not entirely clear who to contact to report the issue.   So I contacted a couple foundation folks via rocketchat to report the issue. Is there going to be a clear and 24/7365 available contact for Incident reporting, response, and then issue management?

                    "content": "Thanks @MakerMan for your questions and @Derek, @wouter, and @Davidutro for chiming in! Few quick rundown points from my side:  We definitely aim to collaborate instead of compete with these Core Units, as well as any other Core Units. Preventing finger-pointing of who should\u2019ve been responsible is definitely one of our goals here - we want to clarify areas of responsibility for security, not complicate things.   Last time I looked around (when I found an issue in the system) it was not entirely clear who to contact to report the issue. So I contacted a couple foundation folks via rocketchat to report the issue.  We would be the one-stop shop here as we could direct you to the appropriate CU to speak with, depending on what the issue is. Since we\u2019ll be doing the identification of critical infrastructure, we\u2019ll be looking into which Core Units are managing what, so can easily perform redirects.  Is there going to be a clear and 24/7365 available contact for Incident reporting, response, and then issue management?  Making sure proper monitoring is around, and creating them when they\u2019re not, is going to be one of the key roles of the Core Unit. As David mentioned, we\u2019ll be working as well with GovComm moving forward to further structure this.  One other question because I don\u2019t see anything in this is whether this CU intends on addressing the long outstanding issue of: dark issues and dark fixes.  Thanks for bringing this up. This definitely seems like something useful, but I\u2019ll probably need to address this in the bug bounty program, as it\u2019ll be laid out in the procedures from bug reporting to bug fixing.  And whether there are clear secure communication channels, persons to handle these. In the past with an issue I found I spoke with the foundation and foundation PE. What I want to know is what are the plans for formalizing these communication channels and what the DAO will need to have secure, private and trusted activities to deal with issues in the protocol being reported to the DAO.  Yep, this\u2019ll be something we\u2019ll take care of. I\u2019ll try to make this clearer as well here. Thank you!  Hey, one thing I forgot to ask\u2013the bounty payouts\u2013will that be in the next budget request? Like I see that StakeWise received $200K for the Rocketpool/Lido frontrunner bug\u2013was that paid by Immunefi? What was the role of Immunefi in that scenario? Besides postmortem write-up. What would be your personal role @TravinImmunefi if such occurred within MakerDAO?  @flipflopflapdelegate Thanks for your added comments! It will be done separately as the bug bounty proposal will also be done separately. In terms of the reward, it wasn\u2019t paid by Immunefi - it was paid by the project. Payments on Immunefi go from the project to the hacker directly, and not with us as an intermediary as we cannot hold funds to be paid out. On one hand, that\u2019s made us attractive as no deposits are required, but on the other, it makes this a bit more complex thus the need to separate it. In all bug reports on our platform, Immunefi provides the platform for disclosing the vulnerability, the same place where the projects also view the bug reports. This way, the bug report itself is contained and 3rd party risks are minimized. Additionally, we help coordinate the PR efforts around all of this. Unfortunately with regards to that specific case, I was not directly involved and thus have no deep insights. However, I can say that if there was a critical bug report on MakerDAO, I, personally would, depending on the stage of the CU and its growth:  Coordinate with the relevant CUs for the fixes Ensure that the bug report flow (covering initial triaging, secondary triaging, and final reporting) is done correctly Lead \u201cWar Room\u201d coordination if necessary Coordinate Post-mortem write-up Coordinate payments to the hacker  ",

There are a number of reasons why it\u2019s preferred to have teams for business partnerships, even if they\u2019re just small like the Immunefi CU, onboarded into the DAO. This is important so I want to call them out. As a starting point, a couple of observations: A/ MakerDAO\u2019s Moats MakerDAO has 3 long-term moats that protect the project from being forked gratuitously, i.e. copy/paste vampire attacks. They are   vesting / locked up MKR which give participants a stake in the game and provide incentive alignment between the team and the protocol,   deep integrations that require an investment to set up which is paid back over the longer term, and   human capital in the form of community members who have invested so much of their time to understand Maker, the protocol, the DAO, and have a wealth of knowledge and experience that takes ages to rebuild from scratch. Going through this learning curve requires a lot of dedication and the resulting knowledge is invaluable.   If we can continue to grow these moats, so will the competitive advantage of the Maker project. B/ Decentralized organizations Delegation works differently in decentralized organizations. There is no command and control structure. DAOs can work only if the teams have a greater degree of ownership and autonomy compared to their centralized counterparts, and become independent engines that drive the ecosystem forward. Even in centralized organizations, outsourcing IT services is not easy to get right. Many large corporations have effectively been gutted by attempts to buy external services to reduce costs, only to end up with a dysfunctional relationship where the supplier is basically holding the corporation hostage because it became entirely dependent on its services while the internal knowledge to provide an alternative is no longer available. When outsourcing works, it\u2019s because of a close working relationship between internal project managers and the external service provider. In a decentralized organization like Maker, who will take up the role of this internal project manager who represents the interest of MakerDAO? C/ Success depends on specific insights The next observation is that one size fits all solutions for a complex and unique organization as MakerDAO are unlikely to work. In order to be successful, it\u2019s important to combine the expertise of the external service provider with expert knowledge about the complex machine that is the Maker Protocol. There\u2019s a minimum number of hours every week that a service provider has to spend to acquire the necessary knowledge to understand how their service applies to the Maker project, in which setup and configuration. And even if they have this insight\u2026 if the best setup deviates from the cookie cutter solution they\u2019re offering, external service providers will rather offer poor service than going through the pain of customizing because that\u2019s not interesting for them if they need to offer low prices. Why business partnership core units are (often) a good idea Bringing these elements together, it should be clear that a business partnership core unit, in many cases, will be a good setup that is a recipe for success:   A core unit with MKR retention bonus that invests a lot of time to integrate Maker with an external protocol or service expands all three of the MakerDAO moats. The core unit members have a sense of ownership, independence and loyalty to the Maker project.   Integrations and services are not easy and the details matter. A core unit with a Maker insider, specialist, combined with a specialist in the service provider area of expertise combines all the knowledge that is needed to get the integration right.   If needed, the core unit will be able to customize the service provider\u2019s recipe to the unique needs of the Maker project. It does not have the conflict of interest to recommend a worse solution in favor of the service provider because its performance is in the first place assessed by MakerDAO.   With an internal team that adheres to MakerDAO transparency and knowledge sharing practices, the knowledge remains in the DAO and the service provider does not have the leverage that may otherwise tempt it to hold its client hostage for ever higher prices.   If the core unit doesn\u2019t work out, it can always be defunded as long as transparency and knowledge sharing are guarded. If the core unit works out well, we have the perfect environment to make them truly shine.   My points are general and I do agree with the necessity to assert them in individual cases. Maybe @TravinImmunefi or @psychonaut can elaborate on how these points apply specifically to the Immunefi core unit. ",

Been having some health and significant personal issues this month unfortunately that coincided with this RFC period.  How is the relationship usually structured with other projects Immunifi works with? Is there a reason why you can\u2019t just name a number you want and then we do/do not take Immunifi on as a CU (basically as a contractor)? It seems fairly straightforward in services provided? I do appreciate the effort of a breakdown at the budget, though.

What services are being offered that Immunifi doesn\u2019t do for other clients? I\u2019ve reached out to several and they all say their interaction with Immunifi is very low-effort and passive unless bounties are collected or vulnerabilities discovered. So\u2026 why does this require a CU and MKR vesting?  Other projects don\u2019t have the same service offering as what we are proposing here. They just have a bug bounty program on our website, so that\u2019s the only overlap. Even the triaging service isn\u2019t something that\u2019s currently formally offered to our clients, except to the very few that got grandfathered in when we were still formally offering the service. For the operational audits, we\u2019ve only done them with a few clients but have rejected all requests since then. With everything else, we haven\u2019t offered them to any clients in the past but have been working on building it up. On top of that, with their bug bounty program, as you correctly mentioned, we are mostly passive. They tell us what should be on there, and we generally accept, though point out some things every now and then, such as if a test/mocks folder was included in the link they sent to us. However, in this case we would be more proactive - it would be us interacting with the right departments (though in this case, core units) in order to draft up the bug bounty program itself as well as maintain it. With all other clients at this time, it\u2019s expected of the client to inform us if there are any changes for maintenance. With this CU, we would be doing active maintenance and regular coordination with the appropriate CUs.  Perhaps I\u2019ve also not spent enough time to understand the details. This is basically for 1) bug bounty program, and 2) a periodic risk assessment of Maker\u2019s technical infrastructure. Is that correct?  I would call #2 more proactive risk assessment instead of periodic. We will be offering regular on-call security services as well and proactively see how often and to what extent we\u2019ll need to provide security services. It won\u2019t only be periodic checking. Lastly, to further add to why we are doing a Core Unit, it\u2019s operationally smoother given the decentralized nature of the Maker ecosystem. With all of our clients, we rely on a relatively central party to coordinate with our team in order to structure the bug bounty program. There\u2019s also a central point of responsibility, among other things. As this doesn\u2019t exist in Maker, though with smart contracts for now there\u2019s the Protocol Engineering Core Unit primarily to coordinate with, it\u2019s best to have a Core Unit so we can be proactive as well as deal with processes in a more efficient manner, given that we would set it up.

What\u2019s the difference between a supplier who is a CU and a supplier that\u2019s not a CU?   I think this is a key hitch for you but in the loosest sense the difference between interacting with an individual vs. a company probably is one expects better response handling.   Honestly the real issue is what Maker gets for what we pay for.    I can guarantee this will be one of the top 3 issues.  The other one is going to be what the criterion is to replace any individual or CU facilitator.   I don\u2019t expect these to be pleasant or easy issue for the DAO to deal with.   The real problem here is there is no way to optimize return for payment. And worse no clear way to hold CUs accountable unless what there is some obvious screw-up and even then human tendancies are to forgive and give people second or third chances\u2026 The real question one has to ask is: What CU currently is supposed to be doing any of these functions and if there isn\u2019t anyone - why do we need them now and how much does this party expect to ask for to provide such services.

I want to start hearing from CUs not just their entry strategies but looking long term to what the maximum costs are expected to be - and I am not talking about contingency situations but more of the steady state expenses as they see their duties and responsibilities now. I am less concerned about this CU being a service company, and more concerned about a justification for how this helps other CUs (offloading of responsibilities by which CUs currently). Frankly when I hear from people like @wouter @Davidutro @Derek I am going to go with opinion here.  I am back to wanting to hear form all my CU facilitators on this because I am more swayed by a larger group consensus of elected/appointed \u2018experts\u2019 in their areas than anyone else. My lean here is to say yes to this with caution over budget ask and expense growth and a focus on good reports on what the DAO is getting for what it is spending. ",

Important aspect to this particular point is that there still are a number of gaps compared to the Maker Foundation\u2019s responsibilities that haven\u2019t been filled in the DAO yet.   Bug bounty program, opsec, and emergency response \u2013 Previously done in collaboration between the TechOps team and the smart contracts development team at the Foundation, under my own guidance as Head of Engineering. This is the gap that the Immunefi Core Unit fills.   Infrastructure management, monitoring and alerting, running various keepers \u2013 previously done by the TechOps team. Can be the responsibility of the TechOps Core Unit that is currently in the SES Incubator.   Auction keepers and UIs \u2013 Previously an unclear responsibility shared between multiple teams in the Foundation. SAS Core Unit is picking this up.   Maker Operational Data API \u2013 This one has always been a mess at the Foundation with several internal projects competing with each other. It can save the teams a lot of wasted time and double work if this one can be its own thing. The Bootnode Core Unit working with TheGraph is looking into this as part of the SES incubation program.   Emergency Shutdown tooling \u2013 was to a large extent done by the JS Product Development team at  the Foundation, with others contributing to the related keeper software. Currently still looking for a new owner!!   In fact it has been the highest priority of the SES incubation program so far to make sure that all responsibilities previously covered by the Maker Foundation are taken care of in the DAO. Some of these responsibilities are being handled as a side job by other Core Units or individuals, in the meantime. But these are accidents waiting to happen. So we need to hand them over to dedicated teams that have these responsibilities in the scope of their mission. ",

Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP42 adds the budget for Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security. It contains:  Total Budget Cap: The hard limit voted on by Governance First-month forecast: The actual first month estimated expenses Regular monthly forecast   Specification  Motivation Based on the nature of the work done by the Immunefi Security Core Unit, the budget reflects the needs of the team to ensure continuity of the work described in our MIP39c2. This is summarized in, but not limited to:  Identification of critical infrastructure and people Initial triaging service for the upcoming bug bounty program Incidence response set up and facilitation Educational content creation around security General security advisory On-call security advisory   Core Unit ID IS-001  Budget Implementation The budget is designed with the following in mind:  Operational costs to run the core unit and perform its tasks Operational costs of third parties contracted Legal expenses Having a buffer for unexpected legal, technical, or financial problems Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders make a commitment to: Funding an initial 6 month budget for IS-001 A continuous funding model based on the SES top-up mechanism    2021-10-27_2159461541\u00d7406 33.7 KB   Team Summary     Team members Amount     Facilitator 1   Deputy Facilitator 1   Team Total 2     External Team Summary  Immunefi ChainSecurity DeFi Safety   Budget Cap Breakdown  Dai Expenditure We will be asking for a Total Budget Cap spanning 12-months, the amount of which is currently $634,972.45. The budget cap will differ from the actual expenses of the core unit. The cap refers to the maximum that the core unit can request for operating and it includes room for unforeseen circumstances.

All costs are only inclusive of all work done by the Facilitator. The quote provided assumes the maximum amount of hours, on a yearly basis, but has been evenly distributed per month.  Deputy Facilitator The Deputy Facilitator will work a minimum of 24 hours per week, increasing the number of hours as necessary as well as having a planned increase to a full-time role as the Core Unit progresses. Like the Facilitator, all costs are only inclusive of all work done by the Deputy Facilitator. A more in-depth description of the Deputy Facilitator is found in the Core Unit Mandate MIP.  Immunefi - https://immunefi.com  In addition to the contributions of the Facilitator, Immunefi will also provide professional services including, but not limited to:  Initial triaging of bug reports Content creation Postmortems General ecosystem security content Core unit focused security content Security advisory services Office hours support On-call security advisory Incidence response facilitation support  The provision of Operational Security Services will be covered under a separate budget proposal.  ChainSecurity - https://chainsecurity.com  The company, which provides software audits for the MakerDAO smart contracts, will provide final triaging services for smart contract bug reports as well as provide technical assistance during incident response. However, it is not expected that this would be used maximally each month. Instead, the amount being requested is the expected maximum number of hours that could be used in the event of multiple critical bug reports and/or an incidence response occasion, also accounting for the additional charge of emergency hours response. The current agreement between ChainSecurity and the Maker ecosystem will continue to be utilized. The only difference is that the funds would be from the Immunefi Security CU if hours are used for operations of the CU. If no hours are used by ChainSecurity, or if there are leftover hours, that is carried into the succeeding month.  DeFi Safety - https://defisafety.com  The company, which provides security scoring for DeFi projects, as well as provides recommendations to projects to increase their security levels, will provide assistance with the identification of critical infrastructure and people and incident response preparedness. The quarterly quote provided is a fee for a set amount of hours for general work to be provided by DeFi Safety. It is two (2) sets of 50-hour blocks. The hours however, may extend beyond the quarter they are purchased if not consumed. However, it is expected that every quarter, this set amount of hours will be utilized and a new block of hours will need to be purchased. The company\u2019s contribution to the Operational Security Services will be covered under a separate budget proposal.  Software and Infrastructure Expenses About $7,500 of these expenses will include, but will not be strictly limited to, the setup and maintenance of:  Secure communications channels for sensitive discussions General communications tools for office hours, general updates, etc. Backups and/or primary hosting for identified critical infrastructure Internal organizational tools Team hardware (e.g secure laptop)  Some software may be charged to the Core Unit on a monthly basis, but this one-time budget request has accounted for potential monthly expenses. As the identification of critical infrastructure and other operations have not yet commenced, we are currently unable to accurately go over what this will cover. All spending, however, will be documented and reported accordingly within reason. The remaining expense of $54,000 is allocated for the software and infrastructure provided by ChaosLabs to provide a better testing experience for the bug bounty hunters spending time on the planned MakerDAO bug bounty program. This is, however, a consumable amount based on the number of hackers that would be permitted to use the software and infrastructure, as well as the extent that they use it. The Immunefi Security CU will use its discretion to approve or reject bug bounty hunters from accessing the software, with the proper process to be further outlined in the future Bug Bounty Program Subproposal. However, participating in the bug bounty program will not necessitate the use of the software and infrastructure.  Company Setup Fees include all legal and administrative expenses for the creation and maintenance of the Immunefi Security Core Unit entity as a limited liability company for one year.  Monthly Budget Statement Within the first 5 days of each month, IS will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditors Wallet with the following sections:  Budget Forecast \u2013 The amount of Dai that is required to maintain a 3-month runway for the team based on available information Previous Month Actuals \u2013 The actual expenses (DAI and MKR) of the month that just ended MKR Vesting Overview \u2013 A schedule of the expected MKR vesting amounts for the current team configuration, grouped by the pay-out month. Transaction Amounts  The required DAI amount for the Operational Wallet to replenish the 3-month runway Any DAI amount exceeding the 3-month runway that will be returned to the Auditors Wallet. The Monthly Budget Statements will be added to the MakerDAO forum. The originals can be found here.     Monthly Payment Flow Once the Monthly Budget Statement has been delivered, the following payment flow will be executed:  Budget Statement Review  SES Accounting will review the monthly budget and check that its expenses reflect the allocated budgets in the budget MIP. SES Accounting may ask the IS team to clarify or correct the budget statement. In case of disagreements, the payments will be paused, and SES Accounting will escalate to the Maker Community.   Top-up transaction  The auditors will pull the available amount from the DssVest contract. Once the Auditor Wallet signers are satisfied with the monthly budget statement, a top-up transaction from the Auditor Wallet to the IS Operational Wallet will be made. The top-up amount will replenish the 3-month runway based on the forecast in the monthly budget statement.   Return excess funds to protocol After the top-up transaction has been completed, the Auditor Wallet signers will return any funds to the protocol that exceed 2x the monthly budget cap.

And what do you mean by \u201cThe Company, which provides software audits for the MakerDAO smart Contracts\u201d are you doing ALL future smart contract audits for all the future components of MakerDAO? And how often do you expect ChainSecurity to play a role ( I think MakerDAO averages around 1 to maybe 2 bugs per quarter). Although a possible compromise can cost a lot more than $30K    First, I apologize for my late reply. I had to deal with a health issue towards the end of last week. ChainSecurity isn\u2019t getting a salary. This is just a consumable amount depending on the amount of hours that they\u2019ll be needed for that month. If they won\u2019t be using any of the hours, then no funds will be sent to them. And yes, they will be contracted. With the sentence that you bolded, I meant that ChainSecurity has been doing audits for MakerDAO in the past. The Immunefi Security CU itself will not be doing audits, though audits and penetration testing may be recommended to other CUs in the course of our operations. With regards to our expectations of ChainSecurity playing a role, we are working on a very rough estimate right now, as the bugs themselves are also quite varied. Some bugs are extremely obvious and don\u2019t even require a Proof of Concept. So ChainSecurity would likely not need to spend much time with it. Additionally, they will be called in to provide assistance with regards to any incidence response that will be needed, and this largely affected that calculation, as definitely more hours will be needed if there\u2019s an active attack.  Can you please provide the Community as to why a Deputy Facilitator cost more than a \u201cFacilitator\u201d and do any of the two also represent a personal interest in ChainSecurity via employment, or equity.  Neither of us are employed or hold equity at ChainSecurity. ",

                    "content": "Hey Derek. Thanks for your thoughtful questions!  Firstly, for transparency, PECU currently maintain a retainer with ChainSecurity for contract and security audits. We also manage the preparation of repositories and documentation for auditor interaction (as it relates to PECU). In prior discussion with SES, we determined the ChainSecurity retainer to be for all technical Maker initiatives and that priority would be given to urgent issues so we would not be fighting over a limit auditing resource. Am I therefore correct to assume that the ChainSecurity $10k would help fund the rolling retainer and the overall triaging of issues from other teams (not just PECU)? If it doesn\u2019t contribute to the retainer already in place, I\u2019m not sure exactly how it fits in, but let me know if I\u2019m missing something.  I was recommended that it would be best for us to have our own agreement with ChainSecurity with regards to this, though the triaging they would provide would just be with regards to, at the moment, bug reports for things created by PECU, as they would not be involved with other triaging. I plan to engage with them about this further this week as I initially wanted the RFC to be up a bit more before some comments - so, perfect timing! What I had in mind was basically that if the Immunefi Security CU uses up ChainSecurity\u2019s time, it would be on our side to provide the payment, not PECU. This therefore doesn\u2019t change the overall allocation, just who pays. So yes, in a way it\u2019s us just contributing to the retainer already in place, but only if we actually use the hours. Otherwise, all else is held constant. Unlike PECU, we don\u2019t really have a predictable stream of hours where we will need their assistance, so I thought it best to structure this way.  In terms of tangible deliverables what does this aspect cover? It makes it less transparent to see the full of expense of the CU MIP39c2-SP24.  Most of this work will need to be done by a specialist through Immunefi Services and not members of the CU, so there\u2019s no aspect of the budget here allocated for that. The pricing of this service has unfortunately been quite a roadblock to the start of this CU and was one of the main things that delayed this posting to this cycle, so we decided to have it posted separately, while still keeping an overview of this plan in the overall CU proposal of tasks to be done. Essentially, Immunefi is still structuring the service. With deliverables, the handbook is the primary one which can be referenced by the respective CUs to incorporate into their emergency response operations as well as day-to-day safety procedures. Full details are under the \" Core Unit Operational Audits - Full Spectrum Security Service\" section. I realize this isn\u2019t clear now and will note this for the next round of modifications - thank you!  Final point, there was prior talk of a TechOps Core Unit taking ownership of what you have listed under software and Infrastructure Expenses (Secure comms, hosting/backup tools, comms and organization tools). I get it that this core unit is focussing on comm channels in the event of a critical failure, but has there been thought towards leveraging hardware/tech from the exMaker TechOps team. Not sure if this is what you had in mind already?  Yep! We plan to use existing things that the TechOps core unit has set up already, but will set other things up if deemed necessary as well as will create backups where necessary. We will likely need to set up our own secure comms channels though, but we will leverage free and open source tools wherever possible (e.g Keybase). ",
