                    "content": "Project Name: Qi Dao Author Name: @geekvine and @benjaminqidao Number of OP tokens to claim: 750,000 OP L2 Recipient Address: 0xB1a8D1D6Dc07ca0e1E78a0004aa0bB034Fa73d60 DefiLlama TVL on Optimism: $3.61M Proposal for token distribution: Distribute OP tokens to QiDao to grow the protocol on Optimism.  Rationale: QiDao is a decentralized collateralized debt position stablecoin protocol where users can deposit tokens as collateral to issue MAI, the protocol\u2019s decentralized stablecoin. It is the largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon, Fantom, Gnosis Chain, Moonbeam, and Moonriver. QiDao was deployed on Optimism two months ago and has seen explosive growth in relation to other chains the protocol is operating on. The goal of this proposal is to explain how to use this grant to increase the growth of QiDao and the Optimism Ecosystem. QiDao is well integrated into the Optimism DeFi ecosystem, having sizeable liquidity on all major DEXs and bridges. MAI has also been accepted into Aave V3. Future integrations include Beefy, with whom QiDao has a multichain strategy with, Arrakis, and Optimism token (adding OP as collateral for MAI). Additionally, QiDao has a community within its DAO that is committed to growth on Optimism. They call themselves the Optimism Alliance. They have been bribing QI voters weekly to vote in favor of Optimism vaults to receive borrow incentives. That has earned Optimism an added $10,000 of incentives per week!  How will the OP tokens be distributed? 20% for bounties on teams building on top of QiDao on Optimism 20% for borrow incentives 60% for MAI liquidity on Optimism (spread between Velodrome and Curve over the course of a year) Breakdown on incentives QiDao is currently providing to Optimism users:  Beethoven/Balancer pool: 15,000 QI per week Curve pool: 3,000 QI per week Borrowing incentives: 40,590 QI per week  Total QI incentives: 3,046,680 QI annualized ($761,644). Total OP incentives requested: 750,000 OP annualized ($457,844). Not only is QiDao matching incentives, we\u2019re exceeding proposed incentives on Optimism by 1.7x. Supporting MAI liquidity on Optimism will encourage users to lock value on Optimism in the form of collaterals. Since MAI charges a repayment fee and no interest, locked value has a longer lifespan than it does on other lending and stablecoin platforms. This is due to users being incentivized to keep their debt positions open.  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? QiDao has voted to add OP as collateral for MAI (for 0% interest loans). This will allow OP hodlers to mint stablecoins against their OP instead of selling. If Optimism supports MAI liquidity, then more users will choose to borrow against OP rather than selling it. MAI has consistently been a top volume provider for Curve on Fantom and Polygon, where MAI is the largest stablecoin protocol. This is because MAI pools have a higher volume to TVL ratio than most native stablecoins outside of Ethereum. Growing MAI\u2019s liquidity will allow more users to bridge value from other chains. MAI is currently one of the most crosschain tokens in crypto, with 20 chains available. As a result, it functions as an effective transfer of value across chains. MAI\u2019s 0% interest and repayment fee model encourages users to lock tokens on their home chain and keep loans open. This creates a resilient TVL for Optimism.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? For the past few months, QiDao has operated on a net profit (revenue has exceeded emissions). This shows that QiDao has built a durable model that can thrive without outsized emissions. After OP incentives end, QiDao will continue to incentive usage on Optimism as it has for the past several weeks.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  Liquidity Incentives : 6 to 12 months depending on OP token price. Borrow Incentives: 6 to 12 months depending on OP token price. Grants Incentives: 3 to 6 months depending on the OP token price.   How much will your project match in co-incentives? All incentives will be exceed by our emissions to Optimism users. Currently, QiDao will give $1.7 for every $1 of OP incentives. OP token vaults will receive borrow incentives based on a bi-weekly community gauge. ",

Thank you for your feedback. The liquidity incentives for MAI on Optimism are geared towards intaking the high demand for borrowing MAI that we currently see in that chain. Debt ceilings are currently 0. We slowly increase that debt ceiling based on the peg and the available liquidity for MAI on that chain. In terms of levering other protocols, Beefy just launched on Optimism. We have a long standing partnership with Beefy and adding their interest-bearing tokens as collateral for MAI. In order to allow users to freely lever those assets, we also need deeper liquidity for MAI (aside from the liquidity that we are already incentivizing on Optimism). As you can see, a lot of growth does depend on liquidity mining. We, as QiDao, can\u2019t allocate more incentives to grow liquidity on Optimism without some support from Optimism itself. As we see that support, we can increase our activity on Optimism.     Benjamin.lens:  10% of tokens will be distributed in the form of grants to users and developers building tools and partnerships to help the protocol grow its presence on Optimism.   ",

Liquidity Incentives : 6 to 12 months depending on OP token price.   Grants Incentives: 3 to 6 months depending on the OP token price.     Lots of projects promise 6 months, or 9 months of runway - however it is not reflective of how a DAO is truly run and how runway is calculated. USD price is still the standard for accounting and budgeting. More money = more grants = more months. It is my understanding that the team can still apply if there are funds remaining GF: Phase 1 after voting cycle 2 concludes. Thursday 3 pm ET Voting Cycle 3 will begin for the recent projects which have progressed into the [FINAL] stage. As for the merit of liquidity mining - yes it can be artificial volume. But is it lucrative enough to attract users to Optimism from other chains? If the answer is yes, then the program may be worth it. Question for the @Benjamin.lens team: would you consider matching incentives in $MAI? QI is better than nothing but still an inflationary token. A more stable asset leads to more retention. ",

We\u2019re excited to be a part of the Optimism community and wish to continue allocating resources to our deployment here. For those that still have some reservations, we want to address your concerns with some updates to our proposal.  Incentive amount new amount: 750k OP Breakdown on incentives QiDao is currently providing to Optimism users:  Beethoven/Balancer pool: 15,000 QI per week Curve pool: 3,000 QI per week Borrowing incentives: 40,590 QI per week  Total QI incentives: 3,046,680 QI annualized ($761,644). Total OP incentives requested: 750,000 OP annualized ($457,844). Not only is QiDao matching incentives, we\u2019re exceeding proposed incentives on Optimism by 1.7x. Currently, demand for borrowing MAI on Optimism has been overwhelming - debt ceilings on our vaults don\u2019t last more than a few seconds. Added liquidity onchain will allow us to increase debt ceilings and provide for more locked tokens on Optimism via lending.  Allocation of incentives 20% for bounties on teams building on top of QiDao on Optimism 20% for borrow incentives 60% for MAI liquidity on Optimism (spread between Velodrome and Curve over the course of a year)  Plans for use cases of MAI on Optimism Lending MAI has been approved into Aave by its governance and its listing is imminent. DEXs MAI is already present on all major DEXs on Optimism thanks to QiDao\u2019s incentives program and partnerships on the chain. Derivatives QiDao will look to partner with derivatives platforms on Optimism, such as Lyra. Bridges MAI is already listed on cBridge and Multichain. We will work with Hop to get listed on their bridge as well to provide more avenues for bridging MAI into Optimism from its 20 chains.  Other partnerships coming for QiDao on Optimism Beefy QiDao has a long-standing relationship with Beefy. We will continue to add their interest-bearing assets as collateral for MAI as this market grows on Optimism. Arrakis The QiDao community has approved the use of GUNI positions on Uniswap V3 as collateral for MAI. As GUNI liquidity grows on Optimism, we will be able to use them as collateral for MAI. Optimism Our DAO recently approved OP as collateral for MAI. This will provide a major use case for OP holders. They will be able to mint MAI at 0% interest, thereby allowing them to use the value of their OP without having to sell it.  Optimism Alliance We have a community within our DAO that is committed to our growth on Optimism. They call themselves the Optimism Alliance. They have been bribing our voters weekly to vote in favor of Optimism vaults to receive borrow incentives. That has earned Optimism an added $10,000 of incentives per week! ",

                    "content": "UPDATED PROPOSAL Project Name: Qi Dao Author Name: @geekvine and @benjaminqidao Number of OP tokens to claim: 750,000 OP L2 Recipient Address: 0xB1a8D1D6Dc07ca0e1E78a0004aa0bB034Fa73d60 DefiLlama TVL on Optimism: $3.61M Proposal for token distribution: Distribute OP tokens to QiDao to grow the protocol on Optimism.  Rationale: QiDao is a decentralized collateralized debt position stablecoin protocol where users can deposit tokens as collateral to issue MAI, the protocol\u2019s decentralized stablecoin. It is the largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon, Fantom, Gnosis Chain, Moonbeam, and Moonriver. QiDao was deployed on Optimism two months ago and has seen explosive growth in relation to other chains the protocol is operating on. The goal of this proposal is to explain how to use this grant to increase the growth of QiDao and the Optimism Ecosystem. QiDao is well integrated into the Optimism DeFi ecosystem, having sizeable liquidity on all major DEXs and bridges. MAI has also been accepted into Aave V3. Future integrations include Beefy, with whom QiDao has a multichain strategy with, Arrakis, and Optimism token (adding OP as collateral for MAI). Additionally, QiDao has a community within its DAO that is committed to growth on Optimism. They call themselves the Optimism Alliance. They have been bribing QI voters weekly to vote in favor of Optimism vaults to receive borrow incentives. That has earned Optimism an added $10,000 of incentives per week!  How will the OP tokens be distributed? 20% for bounties on teams building on top of QiDao on Optimism 20% for borrow incentives 60% for MAI liquidity on Optimism (spread between Velodrome and Curve over the course of a year) Breakdown on incentives QiDao is currently providing to Optimism users:  Beethoven/Balancer pool: 15,000 QI per week Curve pool: 3,000 QI per week Borrowing incentives: 40,590 QI per week  Total QI incentives: 3,046,680 QI annualized ($761,644). Total OP incentives requested: 750,000 OP annualized ($457,844). Not only is QiDao matching incentives, we\u2019re exceeding proposed incentives on Optimism by 1.7x. Supporting MAI liquidity on Optimism will encourage users to lock value on Optimism in the form of collaterals. Since MAI charges a repayment fee and no interest, locked value has a longer lifespan than it does on other lending and stablecoin platforms. This is due to users being incentivized to keep their debt positions open.  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? QiDao has voted to add OP as collateral for MAI (for 0% interest loans). This will allow OP hodlers to mint stablecoins against their OP instead of selling. If Optimism supports MAI liquidity, then more users will choose to borrow against OP rather than selling it. MAI has consistently been a top volume provider for Curve on Fantom and Polygon, where MAI is the largest stablecoin protocol. This is because MAI pools have a higher volume to TVL ratio than most native stablecoins outside of Ethereum. Growing MAI\u2019s liquidity will allow more users to bridge value from other chains. MAI is currently one of the most crosschain tokens in crypto, with 20 chains available. As a result, it functions as an effective transfer of value across chains. MAI\u2019s 0% interest and repayment fee model encourages users to lock tokens on their home chain and keep loans open. This creates a resilient TVL for Optimism.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? For the past few months, QiDao has operated on a net profit (revenue has exceeded emissions). This shows that QiDao has built a durable model that can thrive without outsized emissions. After OP incentives end, QiDao will continue to incentive usage on Optimism as it has for the past several weeks.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  Liquidity Incentives : 6 to 12 months depending on OP token price. Borrow Incentives: 6 to 12 months depending on OP token price. Grants Incentives: 3 to 6 months depending on the OP token price.   How much will your project match in co-incentives? All incentives will be exceed by our emissions to Optimism users. Currently, QiDao will give $1.7 for every $1 of OP incentives. OP token vaults will receive borrow incentives based on a bi-weekly community gauge. ",

For Maker to match - let alone pursue this proposal - is very bureaucratic. By partnering with Maker, the benefit seems to be twofold - unparalleled marketing, encouraging the largest DeFi protocol by TVL to integrate with Optimism. For $MAI - AFAIK there are much less strict minting requirements compared to DAI and is a great way to spread adoption and liquidity across the ecosystem. Disclaimer: We are also a MakerDAO delegate.

We\u2019ve just launched OP as collateral for MAI. This means users will be able to mint MAI at 0% interest against OP tokens. On top of that, we\u2019ll be providing a heavy incentives package to those that borrow MAI against OP. These incentives will be live on Sunday. Borrow incentives for BTC vault are already live. If you have any questions/comments/suggestions, please come to our Discord. Will be happy to chat  Launch announcement: https://twitter.com/QiDaoProtocol/status/1552845396740898816?s=20&t=8usqlzc5fnRi_an3xcWEmw ",
