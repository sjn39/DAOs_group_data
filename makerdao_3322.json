Provide a brief history of the project The history of the project is embedded in the separate histories of the main two entities behind the Company - Series - Blue Horizon and SolidBlock as well as the opportunity afforded by one of the world\u2019s top tourist destinations - Phuket, Thailand. Blue Horizon reached out to SolidBlock to tokenize their project and assist in raising funds to complete the fourth phase of the hotel. SolidBlock and Blue Horizon entered into a partnership agreement to execute the tokenization project providing the entity structuring, regulatory compliance and technology platform.  960\u00d7540 22.7 KB  The Project Team: Blue Horizon - An international real estate development company operating in Asia since 2005. Blue Horizon\u2019s portfolio comprises construction projects including institutional, industrial, educational, residential, and multi-family housing, through all project aspects, including project planning, scheduling, quality control and cost and design-build construction. Blue Horizon is known for consistently meeting construction deadlines and budget requirements through project planning, scheduling, quality control and cost management. Blue Horizon (BH) is providing the asset - The Beachfront Hotel - BF - (BH is 100% owner of BF) and the Company-Series is purchasing a 25% stake in BF co LTD and that is owned by BH.  1280\u00d7720 643 KB  SolidBlock is a smart contract development and management platform for tokenized assets. In other words, SolidBlock transforms real estate, a traditionally illiquid asset into a tradable security through tokenization. Its claim to fame was the Aspen Coin - the first ever tokenized commercial real estate project in the world whereby SolidBlock raised $18M in 4 months for the luxurious St. Regis Ski Resort in Aspen Colorado. The Aspen Coin was listed on tZERO in Sep 2020 (amidst the COVID-19 crisis), traded by over 700 customers with over 4-8% of its market cap traded every month. The issuance price was $1 and the current price stands at about $1.30 (30% premium). The SolidBlock team is hustling, simultaneously, working on diverse tokenization projects for residential, commercial, and hospitality-based properties in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Moreover, SolidBlock prides itself on its efforts to advance and facilitate interoperability and regulatory standardization, thus mitigating barricades to digital markets and investing.  960\u00d7540 211 KB  Through the leveraging of these two companies\u2019 wealth of experience, the Beachfront Digital Coin (BFDC) was born. BFDC provides an unprecedented opportunity for savvy investors interested in digital securities backed by one of the safest asset classes, namely real estate located in one of the world\u2019s top tourist destinations - even in the midst of the COVID Pandemic. Why Phuket? Phuket has the highest number of visitors per square mile per day, than any other tourist destination in the world. The table below shows the ranks of different destinations based on the number of tourists per square mile     Rank Destination Tourists per Square Mile     1 Phuket, Thailand 5,090   2 Palma de Mallorca, Spain 2,918   3 Pattaya, Thailand 2,762   4 Paris, France 1,174   5 Barcelona, Spain 605    There are currently 146 hotels in Phuket and with the increasing number of tourists, this industry realizes a 7.3% year-on-year increase. In 2019, three new shopping malls were opened; Central Patong, Blue Tree Phuket and Porto de Phuket, further enhancing Phuket\u2019s attractiveness as a tourist destination. Despite the pandemic, Phuket Hotels occupancy rate was 32.5% in the first half of 2020 and it is forecasted that the hotel supply will increase by a further 13.4% by 2023. Chinese tourists are the largest contributors to Thailand\u2019s tourism industry and receive an average of 5.6 million tourists per year. In the first half of 2020, Phuket received 1.8 million international and domestic passengers. On average Phuket hotel occupancy rate in the first half of the year (H1) in 2019 was 73.6%. The total tourism receipts in 2019 was THB 46 Billion from domestic tourism and THB 370 Billion from International tourists. Phuket During and Post- COVID-19 Following the closure of borders, due to the pandemic, Phuket is now preparing to receive its first group of tourists. A group of 120 Scandinavian tourists are due to arrive in Phuket on 1st November. In Asia\u2019s first international destination recovery initiative post Covid-19, the Global Hospitality branding agency (QUO) are collaborating with the Phuket Hotels Association, to create an aspirational relaunch campaign aimed at reviving travel to Phuket. This campaign will focus on sights, sounds, feelings, tastes and emotions evoked by Phuket and is aimed at attracting both domestic and international travelers to Phuket. Additionally, Phuket\u2019s hotel sector will be boosted by improved infrastructure, e.g. Phuket International Airport expansion Phase 2 due in early-2021, increasing capacity to 18.5 million passengers per year and Phase 3 by 2023-25, increasing capacity to 25 million passengers per year.; the Phuket Light Rail Transit System by 2024 and the new Andaman International Airport by 2025 4.

How is the applying collateral type currently used? The current collateral type uses an asset backed SPV tokenization structure. The asset - 25% equity in the hotel - is placed in a newly formed entity (the Delaware Series LLC) which is tokenized. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? The SPV for the project is a United States Delaware Limited Liability Series formed for the purpose of investing in The Beachfront. SolidBlock Inc. a Delaware C-Corp, is the general partner of this SPV and thus, bears general responsibility. The investors will be protected through the use of 3rd party compliance and audit partners, who will be acting as escrow agents on the funds collected - verifying every transaction of the Company-series and the use of funds. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? Exchanges may occur in two distinct ways: Via peer-to-peer trading tokens over the counter on the SolidBlock platform, following a 1-year lockup for US investors, as per the US regulation. The tokens will also be listed on the INX exchange and possibly other exchanges and ATSs with appropriate level of licenses with whom SolidBlock works (tZero, Archax, Merj, Atlas.one, Texture Capital, Rialto, ADAX, etc.) 10. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. We have created an official Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) , guided and written by our US US-licensed securities attorney (Sam Katz) and are raising funds under Reg D 506C, Reg S and Reg CF. The project also passed due diligence with North Capital, which is a registered US-based broker-dealer and local due diligence completed by Wintawong & Associates Legal and Translation Services, a local legal firm specializing in Thailand real estate assets.

(Determined by Legal Domain Team) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. As mentioned above, we are using Reg D 506C, Reg CF, Reg S for which we have filed or will file Form C and Form D with the SEC. We have registered with Edgar. All the subsequent links will be provided in the comments section. We registered the security with the CUSIP Global Services. Legal Entity Name: SolidBlock Holdings LLC - BeachFrontDigital. The GMEI/LEI registration number will be provided in the comments section. 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. The initial data source is based on the initial valuation presented based on the appraisal provided. The data source will be the price. In other words, the question we tackle here is price setting mechanism. Initially, there will be an issuance price and thereafter, the price oracle will be the market fee - the price for which people are actually buying and selling. It should be noted that at this point, only the SPV is borrowing against the collateral. 13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. We have several accredited investors and groups who may be interested in taking part in liquidation of the collateral in case of default. We will need to develop the list and grow the potential investor base together with Makerdao. ",

Not sure I have fully understood but the token represents a LP equity of a SPV that has a structured product as an asset. This asset is a combination of a 10-year in fine loan and some warrants to be converted as shares at year 15. Liquidity seems low so it is hard to onboard as a crypto-collateral (KYC would be an issue as well).

There is a guaranteed cash flow for 10 years, and then dividends paid from the equity distribution. We would be interested in collaterizing the asset and leveraging it using defi based on the equity value and a fixed / variable return. We do expect to have some liquidity on the tokens via exchange partners and internal investors.

I must admit I have not seen returns mentioned as fixed when they vary in the 7-10% range. You mention a pre-defined schedule - maybe provide a link to this? It\u2019s a fixed return based on the schedule seen here (link to the investment agreement)  3. Could you provide a payment schedule year 0-16 including any Year 15 asset sale? Years 0-10 as listed above. After year 10 is based on 25% profit share (free cash distribution). Year 11-15, based on the pro forma projections, estimated expected free cash: $921,059 $999,280 $1,040,877 $1,084,142 $1,130,223 Final sale / disposition income: $16,146,037 Please note figures do not include management, carried interest or closing costs. 4. Specifically how is interest payments transferred to token holders? Dividends / distributions can be transferred in USDT or USD to the bank. We may be able to accommodate other methods if needed. 5. Are the interest and asset sale income in any way taxable in Thailand? Yes, there is withholding tax in Thailand of 10% 6. What happens to the tokens after Year 15? Are they somehow deleted? The model shows a year 15 exit sale / disposition of the 25%. When the asset is sold there is a final distribution to investors and the tokens are burned. ",

                    "content": "Dear @Yael_Tamar, The process for MIP6 applications for off-chain collateral, so called real-wold assets, has been under significant review by the teams involved in collateral onboarding (RWF, CES, Growth and incubating LTS and LOVE). See more for collateral onboarding process. The goal of this process update is to provide MKR tokenholders and respective delegates a comprehensive view of MIP6-RWA applications from a credit, legal and technology perspective so tokenholders can make a more informed decision before moving applications through the execution of the onboarding process after greenlight. As part of this review, MIP67 and the underlying Methodology for structured finance transactions were written to provide applicants with a more comprehensive set of guidelines and requirements so MIP6 applications are fit for purpose and closer to a state where they could be executed, if prioritised by tokenholders during polls. MIP67 is now part of the MIP6 process. It is designed to fill the gaps in the MIP6 application for RWAs. Our domain team is aligned to the approved MIP67 process and Methodology. We are asking MIP6-RWA applicants to express whether they will retrofit their MIP6 applications in line with MIP67/Methodology guidelines. We ask applicants to express their intention by Mon 9 May at 12pm UTC. The collateral application template is located here: MIPs Portal. Status of MIP6 applications that do not express their interest by 9 May will be considered \u201cwithdrawn\u201d from a MIP6 collateral onboarding point of view by the aforementioned Core Units and reflected in the CSI. We understand that once applicants express their intentions, there will be a period for drafting and updating documentation of the newly proposed MIP6 applications. Our teams will be available to provide guidance to applicants during this time. Kind regards, William. ",
