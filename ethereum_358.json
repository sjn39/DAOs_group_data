In my opinion, 867 was not a good precedent to set, and that\u2019s why it failed. I believe this is marginally closer, because hard forks have a signaling process that corresponds loosely to general consensus instead of a review board and public hearing like 867 proposed. I think this is at the core of good governance of our platform, and the fact that a resolution to this issue keeps getting proposed I think shows that we need something in place. It needs to set the correct precedent moving forward such that it is as robust and fair as possible, and this is a much larger conversation we need to be having as a community. The decisions being made here affect far more than the money that was lost. ",

When any person or group is able to pick winners and losers, you inevitably get corruption, bribery, etc.  This would set a terrible and dangerous precedent.  Parity/Polkadot has a lot to gain from this being accepted \u2013 how much would they rationally be incentived to offer in direct bribes and/or indirect social media manipulation to help get this passed?  Maybe they wouldn\u2019t do this and are good actors, but it cannot be assume others would be.

Being all too familiar with the EIP process, I have to note this was extremely quick. It should also be noted that counter-point EIPs exist such as EIP#894 which meet the criteria to be merged (having responded to feedback) which have not been. This issue, as you aptly point out is quite contentious. I understand that a merged EIP does not mean the EIP is accepted and will be implemented. I am afraid that the greater community does not. I currently have not yet made a decision, on a personal level, of where I stand on this issue. The spotlight is now shining on the EIP reviewers, the core dev team and the community on how this will be handled. I implore you all to remain impartial if your position in the community asks this of you, if not let your opinions be heard and known to the public. Thus we as a community are thrown into the world of public perception. Ethereum\u2019s immutability will be questioned. Motives, impropriety and cronyism will all be brought up in the public sphere. Let the result of this be advantageous for the community and not for a single actor.  Asking the Ethereum community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the Internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where Ethereum is used.  We will no doubt spend many hours if not days discussing this and issues like this in the future, I quote EIP1 above and I hope we all think through this in-depth. Does this benefit the entire community and not just the author. ",

That EIP doesn\u2019t meet the bar for editorial requirements (IMO), as has been discussed pretty thoroughly in the EIP comments.  The editors have tried to give feedback to the author on how it can be changed to be more grammatically/technically sound, but the author insists on using particular language, I believe because the purpose of the EIP is meant to be evocative. I believe some of the EIP editors are against recovery, but they are generally all able to remain objective in their editing role, which is to ensure that EIPs that get merged as a draft are effectively written so as to effectively communicate what they are proposing.  You can even see in the discussion of 894 that people in favor of the EIP don\u2019t even agree on what it means because the wording is so unclear and vague. ",

A group that wants a general solution, but not a cherry picked solution for the Parity hack and hence would support EIP-867 but would oppose EIP-999 A group that doesn\u2019t want a general solution, but would accept this one-time only decision. Hence this group would agree to EIP-999, but not to EIP-867. A group that thinks either solution is a good solution and would support both EIPs.  Personally, I firmly belong to group 1. Both EIPs require an offchain decision and hence is vulnerable to bribery and extortion. Parity has a huge financial incentive to make these EIPs pass and hence have a huge financial incentive to bribe people, the media, etc. Parity might be a good actor, and not employ these tactics, however, this sets a hugely important precedent. What is to stop another actor that manages to lose a good chunk of money not to employ these kind of dirty tactics? Also, many many funds have been lost in the past. Why should we even discuss this particular case, but not all the others? If either EIP is allowed to pass, who is going to decide which other parties will have their funds restored? This whole idea is incredibly dangerous and will set a very bad slippery slope that we should avoid at all costs. In my opinion, the Ethereum blockchain loses much of its value if it loses the immutability property and hence I strongly oppose this EIP. A lessened form of decentralization and immutability should only be allowed to be used on sidechains. Immutability is THE most important property of the base layer and should be protected at all costs. A blockchain based system that is vulnerable to bribery and extortion is no more valuable than legacy systems and will soon meet the same corruption that plagues legacy financial systems and politics. No thank you. Lastly, while I do feel incredibly sorry for the people who lost money in this, this ultimately was employing extremely sloppy practices on Parity\u2019s part. No formal third party audit after the code was changed that is handling hundreds of millions of dollars is just a sad state of affairs. A bailout here would simply give out the message it is okay to not follow best practices, because a bailout is around the corner should mistakes be made. ",

Beyond being in favor of occasionally \u201cintervening\u201d, I would advocate that the community generally be prepared to alter the shared state in order to prevent harm to individuals or organizations. Tools and governance processes need to be in place. Still, I understand and appreciate that there is a widespread expectation for immutability in Ethereum. This is a special property which has many measurable benefits. However, immutability of information systems is unprecedented in human history. This property does not absolve us of moral or legal responsibility for what happens in the Ethereum network. It may be dangerous to enforce this immutability absolutely, or simply to be unprepared when we as a community must suddenly act to alter the shared state. Perhaps with EIP-999 and other ether recovery EIPs we can attain and manage an extremely low mutability in our system instead of assuming immutability. ",

Specifically, decentralization provides the means to protect against centralized control that would otherwise threaten an individual\u2019s right to control his or her own assets. Decentralized blockchain systems have value as a tool because they can protect private property rights in a way that was not previously possible. However, to the extent these new systems introduce new ways that prevent owners from accessing that which they own, they fail to be useful. Also, the blockchain is not immutable, nor would it be of any use if it were. The current state of the blockchain mutates with every transaction. However, client logic is designed to prevent unauthorized changes. An account owner authorizes the client application to perform actions on his or her behalf by signing transactions, thus proving their ownership and intent to mutate their portion of the blockchain state.  To be clear, owners grant permission to the client to modify the blockchain state on their behalf, not the other way around. How, then, should a decentralized system behave when users are prevented from controlling the assets they own? Proof of ownership and intent are of primary importance. If ownership and intent can be demonstrated (e.g. through signed messages, data on chain), what grounds do we have to prevent owners from controlling their assets? Why should we sacrifice the ends in support of the means? ",

Do you think it is reasonable we will be able to restore any and all lost funds, including a single dollar in a failed testing application? No? I agree, that would be completely unworkable. So there would need to be some kind of cut-off what will be restored and what not. This is the dangerous part. Who will decide what should be restored and what should not? How do we prevent these entities from being bribed or extorted? Again, a blockchain where extortion and bribery is possible is not useful to me. And that is not the only issue with that. There are more nuanced and indirect consequences of such a system. The fact that only some funds will be restored, because they are worthwhile (hundreds of millions vs a single dollar) means there will be a preferential treatment by definition. And this will bring forward a \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d mentality. Assume for a moment there is party A that runs a smart contract for multisign wallets and is the largest by far. Then party B comes with a new smart contract for multisign wallets. People like how it\u2019s used, however, why should you use this new smart contract that is dealing with much less funds? Due to preferential treatments and \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d mentality it would be better to use an older, perhaps even inferior version, simply because it is dealing with larger amounts of money and hence in the event of lost funds, there is a greater chance they will be bailed out. This would then be a very strong force that leads to monopolies (centralization) and uphold these monopolies. This \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d mentality reminds me one thing: Banks. And not in a good way. Please, for the love of Blockchain, let\u2019s keep such a mentality away from Ethereum. We need real, workable and sustainable solutions: Formal third party code audits. If Parity had done their due diligence this would never have happened. And I agree, even with formal audits, things like these might still happen. So let\u2019s solve this in a fair way: Insurance. Decentralized insurance funds could easily work for insuring against these kind of code bugs. And they\u2019ll bring about loads of other positives: They will probably enforce code audits, or they refuse to insure  a smart contract. They can be used by large parties, but also by smaller parties, hence no preferential treatment. And most importantly, disputes will be handled between the insurance fund and the affected party, instead of being handled at Ethereum\u2019s base layer, which brings decreased immutability for everybody.

Trust minimization, 2. immutability, 4. finality, 9. least authority and 10. adherence are the key ones in this debate. 10 Principles for Blockchain Governance:   Trust Minimization: To reduce the reliance on trusted third parties for entering, processing and finalizing transactions and smart contracts.   Immutability: Accounts, balances and smart contracts cannot be modified except by holders of corresponding private keys by entering transactions according to protocol rules.   Fungibility: Native tokens must all be the same and interchangeable globally.   Finality: Transactions and executed smart contract code cannot be reversed once entered, processed and finalized according to protocol rules.   Censorship resistance: As long as they are compliant with protocol rules, transactions or smart contracts cannot be prevented from being entered, processed and finalized.   Permissionlessness: As long as they are compliant with protocol rules, anyone from any place in the world can create accounts, enter transactions and smart contracts, or participate in the network as a competent developer, miner, validator, node operator, user, or any other prescribed participant or stakeholder.   Auditability: Transaction and smart contract history must be analyzable and reconcilable by anyone or by holders of corresponding private keys.   Reconcilability: Transaction and smart contract history must match mathematically to the latest and all future states according to protocol rules.   Least authority: Developers, miners, validators, node operators, users, and all other prescribed participants and stakeholders must limit their participation to practicing only the functions of their roles in accordance with protocol rules and these common principles.   Adherence: Developers, miners, validators, node operators, users, and all other participants and stakeholders must make sure they collectively decide and implement future changes to the protocol in accordance with these common principles.

The entire Ethereum network cannot be jeopardized for your loss and Parity\u2019s poor development and irresponsibility. Rationale:  Public blockchains, as they are systems exposed to the environment with no protection other than their internal security (cryptography, game theory, extra-economic incentives, and coordination problem), need to have a strong ethos of immutability at the protocol layer and social layer. Immutability is about property and contracts. Blockchains contain ledgers with property titles, assets, programs and contracts. These rights, provided by these new networks, cross all borders and reach everyone in the world regardless of their country, religion or local security conditions. Since no social layer blockchain community can understand or manage the local situation of all humans and their specific geographies, the only way to make blockchains available and usable for everybody is to make sure the database, with the property and contracts, are neutral and unchangeable. If they were changeable by people or authorities foreign or strange to them, people would not be able to rely on blockchain nor deposit their wealth nor count on them for their agreements. To make blockchains immutable, the developers and their blockchain communities need to focus only on technical development, upgrades and fixing bugs if any. These have global impact and are scalable. If the community spends time and effort solving local accounting problems that lead to property restitutions and changes in programs and smart contracts, then they are intervening in the matters of specific users, which is a path to lack of integrity and security of the public network environment. It also opens the blockchain community, and the platform itself, to possible manipulation through bribes, possible government coercion, and other narrow human interests and vices in general. The above means that local issues such as the Parity multisig wallet bug and their users\u2019 losses should be dealt with between those parties privately, but not using the general public blockchain network as a loss restitution and resolution device. This would make the blockchain an arbitrary, rule changing environment and thus not secure and not useful for unrelated strangers globally. If it\u2019s true that the community, developers and node operators must not intervene changing the state to solve the Parity loss to protect the general public blockchain\u2019s secure environment, then that means that Parity and its users must deal with that through other means. By \u2018other means\u2019, it is meant either through the traditional legal system if there is no agreement between the parties on how to reimburse the victims, or through friendly settlement. It also means that maybe there is no solution and the users must bear the loss. I am not a lawyer nor am I arguing the above to actually propose a concrete legal solution, but to state that the blockchain environment must be left alone and secure, and any solution of the Parity loss must be dealt with off-blockchain, whatever that solution may be, legal or non-legal.

As soon as you add a subjective process for deciding what the blockchain state should be, you are compromising on the core utility of the protocol as an objective source of truth. We should try and solve issues that are unrelated to security or scalability at the application layer rather than at the blockchain protocol layer.  I think its clear that there is significant demand for a mechanism that makes the platform more forgiving to user mistakes. However, I think such a mechanism should not be built in to the base-layer blockchain protocol. I would support and encourage community adoption of a private insurance model where users pay a premium to insure specific contracts they use, the insurance provider would assess the risk of a given contract, and if the user experiences a bug that is covered by their insurance agreement they can be paid out. I would also support the adoption of a new token (perhaps a stable-coin) which has a fund-recovery process built-in. Changes to balances of that token would not require irregular state changes at the base-layer. Users would be able to use the token and be assured that their funds could be recovered, while users and developers who rely on the objective nature of the Ethereum would not be impacted. Both of these approaches have the advantage of separating the concerns of securing and scaling ethereum from the subjective governance over user balances. ",

Ethereum devs will be perceived as a final arbiter of asset balances. They will be the weakest link in securing the Ethereum ecosystem. There will be rapidly increasing incentive to target and forcibly coerce client developers by criminal and state actors. If the blockchain can be edited by a few key people, then governments will demand Ethereum devs implement KYC/AML measures in Ethereum client. State agencies of various nations can issue compliance demands in secret that order Ethereum devs to freeze various accounts that are accused of helping fund terrorism. Going public with these security letters to gain consensus or refusing to implement them can easily result in criminal liability and imprisonment for developers. Very large entities in Ethereum can now adopt the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d attitude where they can recieve a bailout from core devs if and when they act recklessly. Privatizing gains while socializing losses is unfair to small entities that do not have the clout to pass a non-technical EIP.  This may be a great benefit to certain friends in the short term. In the long term, however, Ethereum would suffer a permanent stain that will result in a non-trivial amount of businesses and developers abandoning the ecosystem for another that is perceived as both more stable and more fair.

If it is should \u201cimprovement\u201d be further clarified in EIP-1 or removed and replaced with \u201cchange\u201d or something with a little bit more flexible a definition. If it isn\u2019t an \u201cimprovement\u201d under the conventional definition of the term, or as intended in EIP-1, should EIP-999 remain open/be merged or closed/withdrawn?   Based on 1, should EIPs be requested to demonstrate their benefit to the Ethereum ecosystem/protocol (as it stands now the benefit for EIP-999 seems to begin and end at a small interest group versus all users/participants).   If the EIP isn\u2019t concerned with any protocol level improvements or protocol level remediation efforts, is this a topic the Core Devs should be spending much time on? If one of the beneficiaries of the EIP weren\u2019t a highly influential client development team, would the matter be something the Core Devs would spend significant time discussing, except maybe for technical viability once community consensus is gauged? If clear consensus is never reached (as it appears with this), should the Core Devs devote time to discussion at all.   The problem I see here is there is a lot of attention being paid to this because Parity is a major and highly valued member of the community.

I\u2019d argue true immutability doesn\u2019t exist, since agreed upon changes can be made as part of the on-chain governance process. Immutability tends to result from bad governance processes incapable of, or unwilling to, handle classes of changes. The decision not to address classes of changes is also a decision, and should be made only with input from all, and revisited as a network matures / grows. I argue Bitcoin\u2019s claim to immutability is actually a function of a centralized decision to not deal with classes of changes that their governance process is ill equipped to handle, or they simply refuse to out of some dogmatic belief. They\u2019ve also not had to deal with a test of that conviction, except for early on when previously valid transactions creating 184bn Bitcoin were invalidated through human intervention. Off-chain governance aside, the blockchain is capable of deciding these things and is the natural venue for such hard decisions. Off-chain governance just seeks to gauge sentiment and whether putting it to the blockchain even makes sense. Aside: How do I quote on mobile lol? ",

That work can be left to the forker. Initiatives that have consensus get core dev coordination, initiatives that don\u2019t, get tabled indefinitely within the core dev forum. I believe ethereum core development, as an organization, should strive to focus on highly agreed-upon initiatives and initiatives that improve the protocol as a whole. Individuals and other groups are always able to coordinate under a different community brand. The core developer organization should not be required to divide itself at the behest of interested parties without very good reason (reasons that garner the consensus of the core dev organization).

And yet:  You have used the scare-word \u201cRegime\u201d to describe open source developers and a network of volunteers; You have reduced pro-social restoration of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of actual existing people\u2019s economic intention as something that may or may not \u201cspook\u201d some abstract set of people; You think hypothetical negative economic effects of massive economic restoration, i.e. doing the obvious right thing, is more worrisome than not doing the right thing. That is, you actually, seriously believe that confidence in an agreement platform increases if hundreds of millions of dollars of obviously, correctable damage are purposefully not addressed, while we even have a measure of that \u201cimpact\u201d in CoinMarketCap (i.e. nobody cares about Ethereum Classic); You believe it is possible to write bug-free code if only people and organizations fear enough its consequences. You believe that so strongly that reverting hundreds of millions of dollars in accidental damage should not get in the way of soiling that precious cultural incentive; And last, but not least, you have actually linked to the Moral Hazard Wikipedia page as part of your argument. (Here\u2019s a link to the Morality Wikipedia page.)  To have an immutable rules event history running on the Internet, you need to perform the impossible technical feat of placing the engine that executes those rules completely beyond reach from humans (in this case, the decentralized society of miners, not the \u201cRegime\u201d at the Ethereum Foundation), since humans are moral agents and not robots and are thus forced to act, even when it is extremely socially inconvenient for them to have to do so (\u201cEthereum devs\u201d and \u201cminers\u201d are all rich, they can financially afford to be sociopaths and just not care, and avoid the social cost of debating morality with Market fundamentalists). If you oppose moral action then your quest for an immutable rules event history on the Internet requires you to scare those moral agents from taking action (which is what you\u2019re attempting right now); Meta commentary: When a moral discussion is started as a technical discussion, this is what you get. Most people that bother to show up are those who have an ideological axe to grind against the moral decision \u2013 since it is weakened enough when framed as a \u201ctechnical\u201d decision, and thus prone to attack by \u201crational\u201d people who have no interest in being actually rational about it \u2013 i.e. starting by reframing it as the moral issue that it is. People who see how obvious and a non-issue the obvious moral action is \u2013 the silent majority \u2013 won\u2019t bother to show up, as it is way too depressing to have to spend your time spelling out teaching basic humanity to a noisy minority that won\u2019t have any interest in letting you correct the framing of the discussion, even if you yourself have the means to pull off that correction (which most people do not, as they are just naturally moral and they cannot really explain it \u2013 explaining the obvious is really hard). I have used the least amount of humor that is humanely possible in this obvious discussion for the restoration of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of damages. However, the best way to carry out this discussion is actually with humor \u2013 see the success of The Daily Show, Last Week Tonight, etc. There are things that are best conveyed though humor, and this is one of them. For instance, you could have cops stopping a robbery and then suddenly they realize: \u201cWhat about all the other robberies that we haven\u2019t stopped? What about the robberies we don\u2019t even know are taking place? This is not fair!\u201d Or maybe there are unforeseen ramifications to stopping robberies, like mass incarceration, and what about the social causes of robberies? Then they just walk away. ",

If you visit the Ethereum subreddit the consensus there is than an overwhelming majority of commentors are rejecting any selective arbitrary funds restoration such as EIP-999.  I literally answered that in my original post, even in a technical format.   Any time the cost C of fixing the issue by hacking a manual hardfork is lower than the benefit B to parties damaged by an event that is a clear-cut, provable bug, the network has an obvious moral duty to act and issue the simple one-line hardfork.  So now we can all just submit a pull request whenever we type in the wrong address? There are people with thousands of ether lost that would love to have that ability. How will core devs decide what is a \u201cclear-cut, provable bug\u201d? Do we need community consensus or should we have an arbitration panel and start implementing our own legal system for every case? When some people get rejected and others don\u2019t and they sue core devs personally, who\u2019s going to pay for the lawyers? Why would any core dev continuing working on an open source project when they could be sued for their participation? How is that in way scalable? What happens when the price of ETH changes? You have not addressed the core issue: exceptions made for one that are not made for all in an economic system is a very quick way to devalue that system. It also brings a host of legal liabilities that as an international community we should be cognizant of.  You have used the scare-word \u201cRegime\u201d to describe open source developers and a network of volunteers;  The phrase I intended to use is regime uncertainty. It\u2019s not a scare-word, its a technical term that describes a specific issue: ad-hoc, unpredictable rules and regulations scare off investors that must plan ahead and wait for their investment to pay off. It is why unstable governments lead to multinational corporations pulling out from entire countries. You need to approximate that cost per your own criteria.  You have reduced pro-social restoration of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of actual existing people\u2019s economic intention as something that may or may not \u201cspook\u201d some abstract set of people;  Your morality is not universal.

Increasing the supply of ETH 1% will reduce the price of ETH 1-10%. The lost ETH is somewhere around 1% of the total supply of Ethereum. If every member on average lost 10% of their confidence in Ethereum from a selective restoration hardfork that they didn\u2019t sign up for then no, the loss in network value is far greater than the funds recovered. The greatest loss will be the number of current and future developers in the Ethereum ecosystem who have idealogical and economic objections to this proposal. I myself will walk away if this kind of EIP-999 is adopted in its current form because I believe the Pandoras Box this would open will lead to the eventual irrelevancy of mainnet.  You believe it is possible to write bug-free code if only people and organizations fear enough its consequences.

I just listed some off the top of my head.  And last, but not least, you have actually linked to the Moral Hazard Wikipedia page as part of your argument. (Here\u2019s a link to the Morality Wikipedia page.)  A moral hazard is a term and not its own form of morality. Excerpt from the wiki page: \u201cA party makes a decision about how much risk to take, while another party bears the costs if things go badly, and the party isolated from risk behaves differently from how it would if it were fully exposed to the risk.\u201d That is the too-big-to-fail mentality that pissed off many people and helped incentivize the adoption Bitcoin.  To have an immutable rules event history running on the Internet, you need to perform the impossible technical feat of placing the engine that executes those rules completely beyond reach from humans (in this case, the decentralized society of miners, not the \u201cRegime\u201d at the Ethereum Foundation), since humans are moral agents and not robots and are thus forced to act, even when it is extremely socially inconvenient for them to have to do so (\u201cEthereum devs\u201d and \u201cminers\u201d are all rich, they can financially afford to be sociopaths and just not care, and avoid the social cost of debating morality with Market fundamentalists). If you oppose moral action then your quest for an immutable rules event history on the Internet requires you to scare those moral agents from taking action (which is what you\u2019re attempting right now);  The economic problem isn\u2019t modifying immutable state. It\u2019s modifying it unpredictably according to political or social pressures on a very small set of people. That leads to regime uncertainty because you aren\u2019t sure the rules of the game will be the same 5 years down the road. If you really want to argue on the basis of morality and not the future of Ethereum then here\u2019s my question: why are you concerned only with the morality of restoring funds for some number of users but completely ignoring the effect it will have on every other user of Ethereum in existence? If everyone else loses 10% of their ETH holdings\u2019 value, is that not a moral issue? Or will \u201cdo the right thing\u201d only be selectively enforced applied for possibly unknown benefactors? My gut tells me you have some not-insignificant amount of funds lost in a wallet that would be saved by EIP-999. Perhaps you plan on dumping these hypothetical funds the moment they\u2019re recovered and have no interest in Ethereum even existing five years from now. Now regardless of whether all this speculation is true or not it\u2019s a reasonable enough thing for a bystander to ponder. Now imagine this kind of argument and suspicion\u2013but for every mistaken funds transfer event ever\u2013past, present, and future. Full disclosure: I have no funds lost in the Parity wallet or any mistaken funds transfer or wallet bugs. I do have some amount of Ethereum I use actively and am developing projects that use Ethereum. ",

You can have infinity value invested in a financial system and it will still be your social duty to fix an obvious failure in that system if it is in your reach to do so. The amount of stake they have in the Ethereum MMO has no bearing in the decision.  I\u2019m still hearing about how contentious it was and how fragmented the community appeared to be as a result. That is not an unmitigated success. If you visit the Ethereum subreddit the consensus there is than an overwhelming majority of commentors are rejecting any selective arbitrary funds restoration such as EIP-999.  Funds were returned to people to the extent possible. Angry market fundamentalists are not valid mitigation to millions of dollars worth of funds returned to their owners due to an obvious, unintentional software fault.  Except that its often bundled with a major feature update. Even if there is a flag to toggle EIP-999, what\u2019s the default going to be? Who gets to pick that default?  You are talking about software development. Software developers get to decide what the software they develop is. People who adopt and deploy software in systems they own decide who the providers of that software will be. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong in the Ethereum developers deciding to bundle whatever they want into the software they develop, and there\u2019s nothing forcing anyone from adopting their version of what their work is supposed to look like. You can try to frame this as an \u201cOppressive Regime\u201d as much as you want, it still is no such thing.  (\u2026) You have not addressed the core issue: exceptions made for one that are not made for all in an economic system is a very quick way to devalue that system. It also brings a host of legal liabilities that as an international community we should be cognizant of.  I have addressed technically and very explicitly why all these concerns are false, but you are wrapped inside a bubble of circular, Market Fundamentalist logic and just cannot see it.  The phrase I intended to use is regime uncertainty. It\u2019s not a scare-word, its a technical term that describes a specific issue: ad-hoc, unpredictable rules and regulations scare off investors that must plan ahead and wait for their investment to pay off. It is why unstable governments lead to multinational corporations pulling out from entire countries. You need to approximate that cost per your own criteria.  A virtual world simulation like Ethereum is not a real-world \u201cgovernment,\u201d no matter how popular the \u201cGovernance\u201d buzzword is today in blockchain MMOs. Your comparison is inadequate. If you don\u2019t like a version of a virtual Internet world, you can just fork it. Symbolic space is absolutely infinite, friction-less and painless. The \u201creal\u201d political world of Governments, Corporations and Investors \u2013 \u201clegal\u201d entities, in a physical space where humans e.g. jail other humans for symbolic misalignment \u2013 is different from the world of a voluntary MMO with \u201cgovernance,\u201d \u201cinvestors\u201d and \u201cDAOs\u201d where nobody has a gun to oppress anyone else. I have commented in a previous Parity EIP that they should just fork off Ethereum if the Ethereum network is not going to act sooner rather than later. It would be better if a new Ethereum was started, with a social contract similar to that of EOS, where the social formation of the network is explicit in providing social story support (e.g. the \u201cEOS Constitution\u201d) as a rhetorical vaccine against Market Fundamentalism and all that \u201cimmutability\u201d nonsense. I care less about the Ethereum network brand (which is all this is about, really) than making sure victims of a virtual economic tragedy (with real human consequences) that society can perceive and act to revert are remedied by that society. It is more important that there IS a blockchain where the bug is corrected, to signal that society and basic human empathy still exist, than that that blockchain where that prioritized wrong can be righted carry the \u201cEthereum\u201d brand. However, there is no valid reason whatsoever for the current Ethereum network to not be that network\u2026 other than Market Fundamentalism.  Your morality is not universal. If we talk in terms of morality then you must also achieve a consensus because everyone will have their own version of what is morally right.  That is a feature, not a bug. I am \u201cpolitically\u201d (socially, in the Polis) acting according to my own will and my own sense of what is right. You are doing the same. What will happen is what the society of developers and \u201cminers\u201d will choose to do. I am not making a fundamentally technical argument because this is not a fundamentally technical discussion. That\u2019s what I mean by \u201cmorality.\u201d My duty ends here, out of my empathy for those who have had their dreams slashed and emotional experience on this planet crushed due to abrupt loss of social valuation in the form of vast sums of this virtual counter we call \u201cmoney.\u201d The only reason I am arguing here is because I can feel their loss. I don\u2019t really care if you can see it or if you understand or not.  That abstract set of people is every member of the Ethereum network. Increasing the supply of ETH 1% will reduce the price of ETH 1-10%. The lost ETH is somewhere around 1% of the total supply of Ethereum. If every member on average lost 10% of their confidence in Ethereum from a selective restoration hardfork that they didn\u2019t sign up for then no, the loss in network value is far greater than the funds recovered.  It would be just reverting the deflation from the loss. If the Ethereum developers and miners do not address this issue, I will lose 100% of my \u201cconfidence\u201d in Ethereum. Because to me this is not about econometric simulation. This is about people. But if we\u2019re going to be into econometric hypotheses, let\u2019s remember we are talking about cryptocurrencies. The thing that crashes 80% in a week, and we are discussing confidence in restoring 1% of the supply back into movable status.  I myself will walk away if this kind of EIP-999 is adopted in its current form  Social groups like \u201cblockchains\u201d need their own principles and reasons-to-be; there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cneutral\u201d markets. Some people will always leave. I will leave if the Parity bug is not addressed\u2026 and nobody cares.  I never said that.  Yes you did not. You implied. I have just unrolled the implications for you, and instead of reflecting upon those you chose to ignore them and respond with an irrelevant list of obvious things we can do to help reduce the odds that bugs happen, even though you can\u2019t bring the odds to zero, which is the only way I see you could invalidate my argument through that line of reasoning.  A moral hazard is a term and not its own form of morality. Excerpt from the wiki page: \u201cA party makes a decision about how much risk to take, while another party bears the costs if things go badly, and the party isolated from risk behaves differently from how it would if it were fully exposed to the risk.\u201d That is the too-big-to-fail mentality that pissed off many people and helped incentivize the adoption Bitcoin.  We are not reasoning at the same level. Moral Hazard is a model, and it is a model that I am arguing doesn\u2019t apply to the situation. Pasting the explanation of the model from the page you linked does not move anything forward. A previous reply from someone else has already addressed \u201cToo Big To Fail\u201d so I will skip that.  The economic problem isn\u2019t modifying immutable state. It\u2019s modifying it unpredictably according to political or social pressures on a very small set of people. That leads to regime uncertainty because you aren\u2019t sure the rules of the game will be the same 5 years down the road.  That\u2019s real life and a feature, not a bug.  If you really want to argue on the basis of morality and not the future of Ethereum then here\u2019s my question: why are you concerned only with the morality of restoring funds for some number of users but completely ignoring the effect it will have on every other user of Ethereum in existence?  I have literally done nothing else but to argue this case.  If everyone else loses 10% of their ETH holdings\u2019 value, is that not a moral issue?  That\u2019s hypothetical vis the real loss of Parity Multisig wallet users, and no, I am not, as an individual moral agent, concerned about this in a cryptocurrency in 2018, the same way I am not concerned if a thief loses what they have stolen or if Ethereum crashes 80% tomorrow (again).  Or will \u201cdo the right thing\u201d only be selectively enforced applied for possibly unknown benefactors?  Reality demands we select (prioritize) our actions. (I am not sure what this objection is.)  My gut tells me you have some not-insignificant amount of funds lost in a wallet that would be saved by EIP-999.  Your gut is wrong. I would not touch a multisig wallet with a 10-foot pole. I am an old software engineer with a sharp intuition for smelling code jockeying. I can see dangerous crap from ten miles away. I would never use something that\u2019s outside the mainstream usage path (i.e. single-sig wallets).  Now regardless of whether all this speculation is true or not it\u2019s a reasonable enough thing for a bystander to ponder.  I am not even a little bit surprised by this, since you have projected a Moral Hazard argument in the developers of Ethereum. ",

This is significantly different IMO than taking ETH that is currently not controlled by anyone and restoring access to the actor who should have access to it.  Eth is not a real unit of ownership, it\u2019s just an abstract denomination of it. The real unit is a fraction of ownership of the total supply. Ethers in contracts aren\u2019t locked, they\u2019re gone. These particular entries in the state db no longer signify a share in the total supply, due to a bug they were reduced to meaningless numbers. The only possible difference is in whose property is getting redistributed. From the redistribution perspective the dao fork was a radically different thing from this proposal, because it redistributed shares from the thief only.  I am of the tentative (would love to be argued out of it) opinion that a fork that appropriately divides one large community with divided ethos into two smaller communities with consistent ethe is a good thing.  I agree. A DPoS fork would be way more scalable instantly, so there may be a niche in the market for it. There\u2019s no point for Casper etc. with mutability, because all problems inherent in DPoS can be edited away as they come - just zero balances of \u2018misbehaving\u2019 parties, problem solved, for some definition of solved. No reason for sharding either, servers in a datacenters are way easier to scale.     fcecin:  To have an immutable rules event history running on the Internet, you need to perform the impossible technical feat of placing the engine that executes those rules completely beyond reach from humans   Not that extreme. A centralized system has one entity that makes decision, a decentralized system requires unanimous agreement. Everything else lies on a spectrum. As unanimous agreement is impossible to achieve for large enough systems, decentralization requires immutability, as no change can realistically achieve a unanimous approval. Right now Ethereum is in the early stage in which control over the protocol is de facto centralized for the sake of technical progress, most importantly because of a promise of necessary future development and partially because of the difficulty bomb, which kills the \u2018do nothing\u2019 option explicitly. That\u2019s fine as long as it\u2019s temporary, with the end goal of a self-sustaining truly decentralized system, in which arbitrary changes are simply impossible to achieve. For that to ever be possible, immutability must be defended by social means while the platform grows more and more decentralized. ",

I signed off the waiver, which explicitly said that I take my own responsibility whatever will happen in the race. And, in the middle of the course, a small group of the participants including me got trapped. In the surface races like that of ultra-running, usually it is not a matter of death and life. And in the case of the frozen by multi-sig wallet accident, I hope, also nobody lost his life. But if we look at the potential creative energy trapped in these funds, - they are now as if dead. Even more dead than the fossils which make up the fuels: energy of the once living plants and species now moves our turbines. So, it is more similar to the, say, underwater race. Or to the miners trapped deep under the surface. I understand nobody is obligated to help. Even more, - if they decide to help, they face more competition, more supply of Ethereum can lead to lower price. And the bigger problem \u2013 split if 2 parts of the community will split, which, although definitely will not destroy the Ethereum but will make an unneeded blow.

IMO, this has resulted in Bitcoin effectively stopping development because their community is of the size that they can\u2019t get 90% support on anything, even things that are pure technical upgrades (like adding new opcodes). I can see the argument for treating things like recoveries differently, but I think no-contest recoveries are generally good and there will always be someone who didn\u2019t lose money who doesn\u2019t want to support someone else getting their money back (accessible supply goes up with every recovery). Personally, of all of the options available (Exchanges choose, client devs choose, default to no-change), I prefer to let the client developers choose (where \u201cchoose\u201d here means pick the default).  If I ever get to the point where I feel like the client developers are not making good choices in general, or are making choices that are outright terrible (like introducing some form of government KYC into the system) then I\u2019ll fork.  Until then, I\u2019ll likely go along with changes proposed by the client devs even if I don\u2019t wholeheartedly agree with them (like I did with TheDAO). ",

That means the arguments it makes are not relevant to whether or not client dev teams should include recovery in a hard fork, which is what mast of the discussion is about. As far as the token thing, it needs funding to be worth anything and each of the proposed funding items have problems:  Donation: This requires people giving free money away to people who lost their ETH. Human behavior studies have shown that humans won\u2019t generally do this unless they believe everyone else is also going to do it, in which case they often will. Since the \u201ccommunity\u201d has already decided not to recover in this scenario, there is no reason for users to believe that other humans will donate, thus they won\u2019t donate. Block reward: This is effectively no different from just restoring the ETH directly, but is more complicated.  It just hides what is really happening in an obscure way, which I find to be a worse option than being transparent about what is being done. Services: This is basically saying that Polkadot/Musiconomy should (effectively) just run another ICO.  Why would people give those two products more money in this new round of funding?  Presumably, the projects have already tapped out the funding source since at least Polkadot ran a dutch auction.  This would also be disingenuous to the original token buyers who were promised that there would only be one round of funding. Future Insurance of Contracts: This appears to be arguing that people with lost tokens should build a new insurance company, and use the profits from that insurance company to fund their losses.  This isn\u2019t a recovery at all, it is just a business idea.  ",

While working on EIP-867, I saw many people say things like \u201cI hope you\u2019re considering non-hard-fork solutions as well\u201d, so I asked around and tried to collect a list of recovery options that didn\u2019t require a hard fork.  The only two options I found were:  Retroactive insurance payouts. Tokenization of losses.  I don\u2019t see Option 1 as viable to address past issues. I didn\u2019t really understand @alexvandesande\u2019s point toward the end of the article about why an insurance company would voluntarily take on enormous liabilities on Day 1. Even if some well meaning person wanted to, what investor would fund them? Also, even for future incidents I\u2019m skeptical. Imagine an insurance company starts up and is wildly successful. It pays out some small claims while making a great profit.  Everyone is happy. Then, the big one hits.  Why wouldn\u2019t it push for a fork? It would potentially have huge resources available to run an aggressive PR/legal campaign. For Option 2, I had considered that the recovery token contract would be funded by future recovery. At best, this would postpone a fork, and at worst it would just dupe a lot of people into buying worthless tokens. Alex did not make this assumption, but I think some of my other pros/cons still apply. Pros  Immediate liquidity for some projects that are desperate for funds Does not require an immediate hard fork (block reward will require a hard fork) A reusable solution  Cons  The allocation of recovery tokens will itself be controversial. New allocations of recovery tokens could devalue existing tokens by a lot. Knowing even a few minutes in advance of a decision would present an enormous advantage and (in my opinion) a much bigger potential for abuse than something like EIP-999. It does not address stuck tokens There is always the possibility that there is some clever way to recover stuck funds. Imagine a future upgrade of the EVM which seems totally unrelated actually makes some type of class of stuck ether recoverable. What then? Which accounts will receive tokens?  Won\u2019t this process look almost exactly like the ERP process? If not, how will it work? What if the Recovery Token contract has a bug? Would people support a recovery fork in that case? Who is responsible for the recovery token contract? Would recovery tokens be viewed as securities? People that hold recovery tokens will have an incentive to make them more valuable \u2013 what sort of behavior might that encourage (e.g. fighting against every recovery issue that comes after you, spreading rumors about a huge loss to get people to sell before you, a large donation promised that never actually takes place)?  I\u2019m not entirely opposed to this approach, but these are the reasons I originally dismissed it. In the end, I think if people are willing to allocate recovery tokens and then allocate blocks rewards to back them, I don\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t be willing to just recover the funds in one go and avoid all this complexity and risk.

If they are identical, the block hashes will match.  If they aren\u2019t, they won\u2019t, and the two nodes will know that there is some discrepancy.   Anyone is free to make any change they want, anytime time they want, without anyone\u2019s permission. However, the change will be detected and rejected by other nodes unless they also make the same change. A single person can split the chain \u2013 the extent to which is matters to everyone else is dependent on how many other people use that version of the chain.   The history of the blockchain is immutable only for a given block hash. In theory, there are actually many versions of history that could produce a given block hash, although we assume only one such sequence of blocks will ever be known, and it will only be known if the hash is computed from history (not the other way around).   The ledger, as an ongoing concern, is not immutable. It mutates with every transaction that is included in a block. If it were immutable, everyone\u2019s balance would be zero (and that multisig library contract if somehow it were able to appear on a truly immutable system could not have been deleted, right?). Claiming that a change cannot be injected into the blockchain in the future because \u201cthe blockchain is immutable\u201d doesn\u2019t make any sense.   Changes to the blockchain are automatically permitted when a submitted transaction follows a pre-defined set of rules. i.e. if I hold the private key for account X, and I submit a transaction that will send ETH from account X to account Y.  Note, in this case, the rules permit me to mutate Y\u2019s account balance without Y\u2019s consent. You could imagine a blockchain in which the rules do not permit this.   The rules of the blockchain system are not necessarily fixed. This is especially true in the case of Ethereum, where plans to regularly hard fork to upgrade the chain were expected from the very beginning.  That is, part of the rules were that you could change the rules.   There are rules about changing the rules, but we probably can\u2019t fully describe them.   ",

Those who are holding locked ether would be better off than they currently are, but they would not recover the full \u2018nominal\u2019 value of the ether. The other side would probably see a diminution of their value as well because of the controversy. Both sides lose. Alternatively, if the two sides agree not to fork, the locked ether could be recovered, but a \u201cfencing\u201d penalty could be extracted by burning 50% of the unlocked ether. An agreement such as this, I think, would be good for the community.

That\u2019s why I think consensus is unlikely. Since consensus is unachievable, I think we must embrace a contentious hard fork. I support EIP 999. I would like to see clients offer the option of EIP 999. I believe the vast majority of miners and other people who run clients will support EIP 999. Many of these people may be silent and prefer not to get involved in argument. That\u2019s why I decided to speak up myself. I don\u2019t want to argue about EIP 999.

A chain split is simultaneously an act of creation (by means of creation of new tokens) & destruction (by means of dilution and the introduction of new problems of user confusion, which have real economic costs to users who didn\u2019t lose funds). And I think a chain split is guaranteed to happen if we follow through with EIP-999. If the project of Ethereum is that we\u2019re attempting to build, in some sense, an immutable actual free market, then using governance to introduce economic shocks into the system seems to defeat a huge part of the rationale which attracted many of us to Ethereum in the first place \u2013 namely, to design systems which could not be interrupted by even the tyranny of the majority \u2013 unless users consented to being governed by that majority. By holding the token, we have not consented to arbitrary violations of immutability, even ones decided by a governance process. The only thing users consent to by holding ether is participation in an immutable network which allows the transfer and use of that ether token. If we\u2019re speaking in general terms about the question of \u2018under what circumstances should immutability be violated to protect users,\u2019 where exactly do we draw the line? How is my accidentally sending funds to a non-existent address no less viable of a reason for eth users to come to social consensus on violating immutability to bail me out? As a community, do we have a standard on what activity qualifies for a bailout? If so, what is that standard? I personally think ether should never be rescued for users with a governance process sanctioned violation of immutability.  If a user wants to create a token on-chain with its own governance logic built in that allows for arbitrary violations of immutability to be made based on some vote of individuals who use the token, more power to them in building those systems and storing value that way in their own system with virtual governance.  I think it should be enforced via community norms that users should understand that when interacting with the ethereum token & network, the \u2018social contract\u2019 we\u2019re signing up to is that if we want to continue participating in the ethereum mainnet, we accept that contract code runs as it is written, with no recourse for bugs in contract logic available via violations of immutability in the EIP process. I try to say this respectfully to all users who lost funds in a parity multisig wallet. ",

Changing blockchain state is always achieved by consensus, it\u2019s already true for every block and transaction. Consensus is expressed by people, and people form a Community around those consensus rules  EIP is a good enough method to propose changes that require a hard fork. Different methods can be chosen to propose changes to the Community, but EIPs are already used to reach consensus about many different changes in the Ethereum ecosystem (Core, Networking, Interface, etc.). If we need to change something at chain level we need consensus, an EIP sounds to me a good enough method to try reaching such consensus  A precedent already exists at block 1,920,000 (20th July 2016), EIP779. Almost 2 years ago, because of some bugs in the DAO contract, someone moved 3.6M ETHs (of a grand total around 12M ETHs) from the DAO balance to its own account. After many days of discussion, the majority of the Ethereum Community agreed that the contract didn\u2019t acted as intended by the DAO\u2019s developers, and it chose to hard fork from the original chain to rescue funds of DAO\u2019s investors, zeroing the hacker\u2019s balance and giving funds to the original smart contract. This precedent demonstrated that the Ethereum Community tolerates changing the blockchain\u2019s state in some specific cases. Ethereum Classic - the original chain - is still there demonstrating  that Community matters and consensus mechanisms work   We can discuss about changing chain\u2019s state because of errors in a smart contract. In this community this kind of discussions are allowed, and in case of success a hard fork is admitted restoring something that went wrong. The DAO\u2019s hard fork, EIP779 and this EIP999 are here to demonstrate that. And it\u2019s very good for me to have two communities that act differently, because I can choose which one is the best for each different use case  About this specific EIP   This seems to me a very reasonable fix. The DAO fix was very serious, and it changed the state at a very intrusive level: it essentially moved funds from an account - the hacker\u2019s one, that has gained those ETHs following the bugged rules of the smart contract - to the DAO\u2019s account. This is very far that case: here many people lost access to their own ETHs, but those funds gone nowhere: they are still there untouched inside each multisig wallets, but nobody can use them. And this because a piece of code - a library - some wallets rely on was deleted by the hacker. This EIP will enable those wallets to regain access to their own funds, giving wallet\u2019s owners the ability to use those ETHs again  At the end this EIP simply restores a state of the chain where multisig wallets can work again, no one loses ethers, tokens or whatever and no one gains them. This seems legit enough to me, and this is why I support this EIP. ",

It allows anyone willing to put in the effort to provide a rigorous proof (or hire someone to author it for them) to get funds recovered IF they can prove to a reasonable human that the funds are clearly theirs and that they are inaccessible due to human error.  The multisig deletion would fall into this class, as would many other accidental fund losses that people have suffered over the years.  TheDAO recovery would not qualify since it took funds currently under control by one user and gave them to others.   The problem with EIP 867 is that it only works for large holders. Someone losing 5 ETH in a provable fashion will be of much lower priority than someone losing 10000 ETH. EIP 867 will just spawn more EIP 999 style discussion. There will be disagreements over the intended semantics of contracts and the fairness of recovering funds. Moreover, support of EIP 867 begs the question, how do you prove that the parity multi-sig wallet did not behave correctly. Is it absurd the fathom that a contract can burn collected ETH using the self-destruct mechanism? I think the main problem people will have is that EIP 999 and even EIP 867 will be an example of a system working to absolve the errors of wealthy stakeholders, without regard to other stakeholder. I believe that in the future Recoverable Tokens (EIP 1080) will be able to provide an opt-in solution for all who want the added safety. ",

The ERP process attempts to simplify that process significantly such that you do not have to be an Ethereum client developer to understand how to craft such a recovery.  It still requires some understanding of how Ethereum works, in particular how trustless systems work (no one is going to just \u201ctake your word for it\u201d, but it doesn\u2019t require you to understand the inner workings of Ethereum clients.     bradleat:  how do you prove to the core devs that a contracts semantics ought to be different that were written or that a transaction should have never happened   This is the \u201creasonable human\u201d test.  For all of the proposed cases (big or small) for the ERP process none of them have resulted in someone truly believing that the losses were intentional.  For example, there is no reasonable argument to a human of average intelligent that the ICO who posted a JavaScript truncated address to their website intended to do that in order to cause people to burn money that was intended to go to them.  Similarly, there isn\u2019t a reasonable argument that someone would intentionally send funds to an address that is off-by-one-byte from a real address that has seen real use.  For the Parity case it is obvious to a reasonable human that the intent of the wallet wasn\u2019t designed (by Parity) so that someone could burn everyone\u2019s money (including the author\u2019s).  The wallet was clearly advertised and used (by the author) as a form of secure storage. Part of the ERP process is to provide an argument as to why you believe your ETH should be recovered, which means providing an argument like the above examples (though of course more in-depth and well written).  The purpose of this argument is to convince a reasonable human that the funds are inaccessible due to an accident.  Anyone can refute your argument and it is up to reasonable humans to decide if the refutation instills enough doubt to block the recovery. @bradleat Out of curiosity, would you be more open to this EIP if it were preceded by a successful recovery of one of the other causes of losses that effects more \u201cnormal\u201d users (like off-by-one-byte address)?  There is some ETH lost to address typos that could be recovered, but no one has bothered to draft a PR for it yet. ",

If this is deemed insufficient, what would be an even more compelling example?  For reference, I reproduce it below:  Considerable example (concise, includes supporting evidence, no negative impact): A crowdsale run by XYZ incorrectly published the testnet address of their crowdsale contract to their public website at the start of their crowdsale on Jan 19, 2018. 501 ETH was sent by 328 users on the mainnet to the incorrect address between block 4,235,987 and 4,236,050. See here for the testnet contract, and see here for the transactions to the same address on the mainnet. See here for a statement made by XYZ on their website. Because there is a contract at this address on the testnet and the corresponding nonce for the creator address has already been used on the mainnet, it is considered effectively impossible that anyone coincidentally holds the private key. We have verified that all transactions came from addresses with no associated code, so there should be no issue returning eth to the senders.  I would like to come up with the most steelman\u2019ed example(s) possible for recovering funds.  We could then set an incredibly high standard of: \u201cUnless your recovery meets this incredibly high standard, the answer is no.\u201d  This would allow us to have more clarity for what sort of recoveries would be done instead of the current vagueness. For those into immutability (which include myself), we obviously want these recoveries to meet incredibly high standards.  And when Plasma chains become more of a thing, it becomes more sensible for us to forbid recoveries on the main chain.  But we aren\u2019t there yet.  So until then I would like to come up with the most steelman\u2019ed example(s) possible that have the most support for recovery.  And when the side-chains become a thing, then we can re-open the issue as to whether to forbid recoveries at all on the main chain. ",

                    "content": "    bradleat:  I don\u2019t Jenny from the block would be able to get a core dev to even consider her proposal. Especially because it\u2019s mostly not obvious what contract features are bugs and which are features or which transfers are purposeful and which are accidental.   EIP-867 was the most streamlined and simplified process we were able to imagine that met the primary constraints (ownership uncontested, required changes are fully specified, the way in which the required changes were determined is auditable by anyone). However, that certainly doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be improved. Really, I think you\u2019re talking about three separate issues:   Awareness: People have to know that such a process exists.  If it\u2019s a secret, then only some people will know it\u2019s any option.  Cost: Ideally, the cost should be (at minimum) equal to the amount of effort required by people to take whatever actions are needed.  If you lose $1 on the train, it\u2019s unreasonable to ask the train owners/staff to spend more than $1 worth of effort looking for it.  In that case, you\u2019re just transferring your loss to them (and then some).  Difficulty: If the process is too complicated, some people won\u2019t be able to execute it on their own. This is a common problem which happens all over the place in the economy. People generally don\u2019t represent themselves in court, many people hire someone to do their taxes, etc.  Sometimes these experts can be replaced with automation (e.g. TurboTax in the US), but not always. It really depends on how much each case looks like the one before it.  Item 1 is pretty easy to solve at the ~75% level, but there will always be people that are just unaware of their options. I don\u2019t know what to do about that, but I don\u2019t think it should stop us from providing the options in the first place.  In any case, part of the motivation for writing the EIP was to make the process discoverable. Items 2 and 3 were both important considerations for EIP-867, and in the end I think the proposed system does a decent job at removing a lot of complexity and cost. Can it be improved? Absolutely. However, optimizing it after the process is actually used a few times would be far easier.     bradleat:  No small recoveries were ever considered.   My assumption was that a single ERP could handle many cases of the same type.  This would make it possible for the cost of recovery for an individual case to be very low.  Also, EIP-867 didn\u2019t consider any particular examples.  Instead, it was just meant to say \u201chey, if we do it this way, maybe we can consider smaller examples\u201d ",

There is some ETH lost to address typos that could be recovered, but no one has bothered to draft a PR for it yet.   For sure. Perhaps committing to a ratio of little guy to big guy support would help quell a lot of suspicions here. ",
