Perhaps if the RWA monitoring discussion doesn\u2019t have much engagement we can switch over to that. As a general topic though, I think there\u2019s a lot of info out there and it might be valuable to hear what @Recognized-Delegates are for, what they are against, and what they envision for the future on this front. For example, The Viridian Cluster SPF not only monitors the Monetalis RWAs, but also funds the due diligence, completion, and ongoing management. Concerns have been raised about the conflict of interest since members of viridian are doing all of this on their own deals\u2013is there a desire to design it so protectorDAOs cross-monitor deals? Should the creditor be paying for these services? These are super important questions that would be valuable to riff on regardless if the author of the proposal is present. That\u2019s my thinking  Given that there\u2019s not a good alternative topic, I will keep this one and we can end early if there\u2019s not much engagement. ",

This helps improve solutions to the prioritization problem. We just need to refine (more detail in video) this initiative before going forward. SES will be working towards proposals for an interface to turn this into a tool. 45:17 David Utrobin: I was impressed how this surfaces a richer set of information, such as understanding consensus.

Is the monitoring dashboard you showed us public or private?  36:51   Frank Cruz: Why do you believe it would be more efficient for TechOps to run the MakerDAO forum as opposed to another CU?  39:03   David Utrobin: How would you respond to the accusation of TechOps double-dipping by charging CUs for various services while also having a budget?  42:45   Simon: I will return to Frank\u2019s question about managing the forum. Having a globally-composed team is an advantage over other CUs; we can keep a continuous flux of work to offer constant troubleshooting for whatever arises in the forum just by having people living in various time zones at a time.  44:29   Santiago Botto: Some people have mentioned that a lot of the work in infrastructure that TechOps is doing for other CUs could be managed by themselves. They could, but are the workers willing to do the extra research and work? Typically, this can result in low morale and, most likely, in asking for bigger budgets to hire more people to do the job. I would recommend developers focus on something other than infrastructure or vice versa.  46:48   Frank Cruz: How in tune is TechOps with the Endgame Plan, budget-wise?

CES has funding approved through April 1st, which will afford us a timeline to prepare for the proper transition to an Endgame-ready team.   Discussion  Initiative: ETHGathering Outcomes   Tadeo 1:00:40  Contents:   Overview \u2013 1:01:07   UNFUZZ Endgame by Deniz \u2013 1:02:18     Q&A 1:03:13   Tadeo: To Schuppi\u2019s comment about redoing this in Denver, that is a good point. We should have more information and developments by then, and I should be able to work through any topics that might still need to be fully fleshed out.   Discussion  Discussion: Existential Exposure & Mitigation   Hexonaut, Risk CU & Others 1:04:00  Contents:   Preamble \u2013 1:04:31   Defining \u201cExistencial Exposure\u201d \u2013 1:05:36   Key Ideas \u2013 1:08:22     Q&A 1:10:37   Raphael: Apparently, our current reporting on the state of debt is complicated. It is necessary to level up in that regard. How confident are you in the RWA monitoring?  1:12:30   Brian: The original plan for Maker\u2019s system was for MKR holders to take losses. Generally, the system should be risk-managed to cover any losses and, if not, to be able to do so with MKR sales. Taking a 500M DAI hit right now translates into putting a 10% hole in DAI value.  We cannot cover that with the Surplus Buffer. The next step would be to sell MKR to recover that loss, and a chain of side effects would come from that. Given a crisis in confidence in the DAI backing, our traditional vault-holders will leave, the PSMs will quickly drain, and that 10% hole that we had can rapidly become much larger.  That takes the risk off MKR holders and puts it on DAI holders. Lacking a better term, in crypto, we call that a rug-pull. In the last few months, we have seen the collapses of FTX, Blockfi, and Celsius. It only takes one of these secondary counterparties of us to fail. As Sam said before, we need a plan for this.      1:17:04   Payton Rose: With the implementation of the Endgame Plan, all of the RWA lendings will happen through Protector MetaDAOs, which should have a first-loss junior position setting up a revenue stream for taking on first losses.   Frank Cruz: As an example, if Viridian, managing MIP65 on behalf of the DAO, shifted that MIP to their Cluster and eventually something went wrong, that first hit should be covered by the MetaDAO and the Core, MKR token holders, would not be affected?    1:21:37   Justin: MKR holders should be at risk should anything fail. Moreover, that is why it is fundamental to ensure that the MKR token carries and increases in value so that we can bear more risk on the token itself.  We have to grow the Surplus Buffer. To do that, we are in a situation where we have to take on extra risk because we are in a negative profit scenario. Everything is connected; all of the initiatives for reducing expenses while increasing revenue are pulling us in the right direction.  We need to find ways to minimize existential risk. To me, that means any loss in excess of the Surplus Buffer. That puts us in a situation where DAI holders take the cut unless we can make up the shortfall with MKR tokens, which we cannot do unless we maintain a certain value.      1:23:54   Sam: As a next step, we should define a number for existential exposure, and that should be more complex than saying that it is a number higher than the Surplus Buffer. Not differentiating between 5 Million and 5 Billion in exposure is a mistake.  Suggestion Box  Credits  Andrea Suarez produced this summary. Kunfu-po produced this summary.
