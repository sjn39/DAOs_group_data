The community seems unlikely to want the peg to be arbitraged using TUSD-A. We are missing a business opportunity by artificially limiting revenue generation  Executive Proposal  ETH-A +150M: following the interim result of the community poll. This isn\u2019t an unusual increase for ETH-A. USDC-A +70M: Also not an unusual increase for USDC-A. PSM-USDC-A +27M (DC increased to 30M): From a risk perspective using PSM-USDC-A is less risky than USDC-A (it provides a better peg and avoid dealing with the liquidation issue).

Two reasons:   @Primoz is the only risk mandated actor currently and he decided to propose only 3M. While we have a bit of evidence that the PSM work, it\u2019s still new and started to be used a few days ago (yesterday?). After discussion with @hexonaut we decided to propose 30M to find a balance between the benefits of the PSM and any PSM risk. What really matters for an urgent executive is to pass (quickly). A failed executive is useless at solving the underlying issues. We don\u2019t have evidence that the PSM executive was easy to pass (it has barely the hat currently).  ",

What about something in between like 100/150M? I feel like 30M will be consumed very quickly.   Yes this is fair. 30M was chosen as a compromise between those that want to see it increased rapidly, and those that are still concerned about the new code.  I appreciate that some people are unhappy about the proposal, or the process it went through. The best answer I can really give to that is that if we\u2019d done otherwise, or delayed for 24 hours to have a poll then a different set of people would be unhappy about a different set of parameters or that we weren\u2019t reacting quickly to the market environment. I really think this sort of process represents the best of both worlds. We have mandated actors that are empowered to create proposals quickly in the event that an urgent change is deemed to be of interest to governance. Additionally, governance can trigger an urgent response through the process laid out in MIP24. In times where there is no urgency, governance is able to fine-tune the contents of executives via off-chain and on-chain polls and the mandated actors don\u2019t propose things unilaterally. In this case the PSM complicates matters because the Maker Foundation can\u2019t touch it. Primoz and Wil being unavailable also complicated things. However in the absence of those people, Sam and Seb are the closest we have to Smart Contracts and Risk domain actors. ",

I agree with proposed changes but I do want to note that we need to increase PSM-USDC-A DC as soon as possible to a higher level since increasing USDC-A DC is not ideal. The issue is that USDC-A SF is set to 0% and speculators have zero cost of capital to perform 100x leverage trade on the DAI price even before the $1.01 price is reached. This literally happened in the past few days. And this means USDC-A DC can get utilized very fast and can not be used right when needed mostly. As soon as we feel confident about PSM we should increase PSM DC more drastically and set DC for old stablecoin vaults to 0. This also prevents increased exposure to TUSD. As for ETH-A exposure I think nobody wants to miss on new DAI minting demand, but we should be aware that ETH exposure is increasing heavily and current rates are probably not applicable anymore at these risk levels. We have been undercompensating risk for ETH-A already in the past but now it is becoming more obvious. Good news is that competitive rates in DeFi increased heavily. If we are going to be aggressive with growing debt exposure increasing SFs won\u2019t be enough to protect though. Community also needs to think about 1) limiting further DC growth of certain collateral types such as ETH-B 2) Increasing box parameter 3) Increasing Surplus Buffer. Imagine we have a big crash soon after this bull run and we get ETH-B liquidations queued due to the 15m box parameter and the price keeps tanking. Not sure though how we can argue higher box value apart from hoping the keeper ecosystem improved in past months. There was also discussion about increasing Surplus Buffer and it seems the community is divided between increase to 10m and leaving it at 4m. I think a solution with a Surplus Buffer increase and the \u2018lerp\u2019 module might be a good compromise. ",

Not sure though how we can argue higher box value apart from hoping the keeper ecosystem improved in past months.   Yes, the current box size is quite the limitation for the debt size and ETH-B. When the box parameter was first set we had $0 in the ETH-B vault and much lower exposure for other vaults. I do agree that it\u2019s a difficult discussion. Some arguments FOR can be necessity and the PSM. Anyways, I\u2019ll be excited when we\u2019ll be able to transition to the new liquidation system. ",

Can\u2019t agree with this enough.   FYI:  Limiting DC growth in say ETH-A pretty much means a locked LR.   So again having multiple vaults potentially is a way to control LR exposure but not a KISS model at all. I have been harping on raising surplus for what seems like forever, as well as creating a secondary surplus/treasury out of other assets (mostly stablecoins) but hey we have almost 500M on the books in stablecoins that are probably under their 101LR and can be liquidated at any time. The real concern here is allowing everyone to rachet up debt exposure on ETH predominantly and then a ETH price crash on part with Black Thursday back to back 25% drops in 24hrs.   Couple this with mempool manipulation to block out bidders and a new liquidation system not up yet and we have another recipe for people not just losing millions but a good fraction of a billion. Fortunately we do have the IAM shutoff - but I am not up to the details of whether those are exempt from the GSM delay and/or how liquidations get shut off again should we end up in the same boat as Black Thursday - gas at 1000gwei and someone controlling mempools to limit smart contract access? I honestly have no clue where Maker sits here with respect to another significant downturn event. ",

Rapid price drops were never a problem before for Black Thursday for Maker. And yeah there were keeper problems but havent there been some improvements since then? And bc it happened once it probably is less likely to happen again as market forces come into play. My preference would be to see Maker get a lot more aggressive here. Raise the limit for Ether an additional 500 million, ratchet the PSM up to full throttle. Pulling in assets means pulling in more eyeballs as well. Lets grow the network while the times are good. I think there is prob more danger in getting too conservative here as it could throw things out of whack. ",

This naturally has trade-offs in both directions.   Yeah thanks for reminding me/us on that.   Frankly what I saw on Black Thursday there were a good number of vaults that would have completely avoided liquidation if there was an auction pause.   Mostly because within I think 2hrs of the price break below 100 the price was above 110 and heading to 120. So is the rate 1M/minute or 15M/15minutes.    I think the biggest issue here would be something I have been harping on since I first came to Maker, DAI liquidity.   USDC-B only has 30M available and that would be exhausted quickly.   PSM is pretty much limited even if it is increased to 30M. We are back to the same situation where if there is a market crash DAI liquidity is going to run out almost instantly.  There still has been no movement on creating a liquidity backstop for emergency events that tracks with DAI outstanding.  So IF/when something like Black Thursday happens again Maker will be in a similar boat.   With Defi space having grown probably 5-10x since then the cascading liquidations across the space the liquidation demand will outstrip network capacity no matter what the price. I don\u2019t think people have considered what happens to on-chain liquidation systems with gas at 2,000 to 10,000 gwei. ",

I thinking raising DC\u2019s and not touching SF just allows people to put the system more at risk.   Here is what I would be for. For each DC increase of 10% up the SF on all assets by .5% and increase the surplus .5% of outstanding to stop MKR flapping for the moment.  Later if things settle down and the protocol has cash in the bank start flapping MKR again. This would be for every 100M of total DC, .5% increase in SF (about 10% increase in average Maker earnings) and bumping the surplus before flap by now 6M a bump. ",

                    "content": "    bit:  You probably mean LR. The LR deals with the risk and the SF with the peg.   No I meant what I wrote. As long as the PSM has DC the SF is rendered irrelevant for PEG management and instead should be used to manage risk in terms of a system fee to control borrowing.   I believe risk to the system here has increased quite a bit.  If we are going to add 100M more DAI of DC and open up the PSM to 500M+ our borrowers can certainly afford another .5% SF.  At some point when the SFs are high enough they will reduce their borrowing.   Until that point they will MAX out the DCs over and over and over until we DO raise the SF\u2019s or we finally hit their LR borrowing limits (which we\u2019d like to avoid).  Given the 200-300% ETH/BTC price rise I would advocate a pre-emptive rise of the SF across the board by .5-1% with the increased DC.  In fact were I in charge of this I would study the markets generally and try to normalize borrowing rates across the board on all assets in the MCD.  This is particularly true of ETH borrowing at 2.5% btw.  (this could be 3-4% easily). Regarding all stablecoin vaults with LR 101. I would also be a fan of zeroing the DC\u2019s on all of them.  Now. In time increasing the SF just enough to put the stablecoin LR 101 vaults in liquidation territory and then piecemeal liquidating them into the new PSMs.  This is particularly true if Maker is going to continue down this route of using stablecoins as the DAI PEG management mechanism into the foreseeable future. The key point to pay attention to here is that using the PSM to manage the PEG (with effectively unlimited DC) frees up the SF for risk management and overall rate normalization across the DeFi space.  I am surprised no-one has talked about this as a sea shift in the way Maker incentives work relative to DAI and as @mrabino1 would suggest will probably have unintended consequences. ",

If we are going to add 100M more DAI of DC and open up the PSM to 500M+ our borrowers can certainly afford another .5% SF.   What risk? The growth of ETH MCap and liquidity is more than enough to absorb another 500M of DAI backed by ETH. If not, there are various ways to find a buyer in advance for a potential 500M in ETH at a discounted price. I think the real risk is not being able to sell the stablecoins for $1 or not being able to move them. I\u2019m sure everyone can afford another 0.5%, but a better solution IMO is to require 200% LR for ETH (not that I think that we need to do anything). 0.5% will hurt borrowers a bit, but how exactly can that tiny amount of money help us in any major crash? It will certainly impact the peg indirectly in a negative way (by requiring more stablecoins). ",

And now that I have poked @Primoz I am hoping some thought as to how the PSM pretty much changes PEG mechanics and affects system risk overall to be forthcoming.    [Signal Request] Adjust the Surplus Buffer   I want to urge people to vote on increasing Surplus Buffer to 10m. Risk exposure on ETH vaults is increasing, especially if community really wants to increase ETH-B DC above 50m, which I also don\u2019t particularly like until we have liquidations 2.0 implemented. We can\u2019t have low surplus, low box parameter, low rates and meanwhile increase debt exposure with this magnitude. Not to say part of surplus is also intended to be spent on some operational costs shortly and stablecoin vault fees aren\u2019t necessarily all collected.       bit:  I\u2019m sure everyone can afford another 0.5%, but a better solution IMO is to require 200% LR for ETH   I know only of a few ways to slow down increasing risk exposure.  Increase SF to tamper down demand for DC (reducing DC growth and giving the protocol more revenues to build a increased surplus) Limit DC growth Open up new vaults with higher LRs to accommodate the increased DAI demand while limiting borrowing CRs to higher values.  Given the PSM nails the PEG this frees up the SF to be used more for demand management than price control.  Given the SF generates revenue for the protocol in return for risk and risks are higher now than before I believe raising the SF and/or normalizing these SFs more to what the rates are across the space would be prudent. .5% of 1.2B is $6M/yr or .5M/month - every little bit helps with the biggest issue simply notching down the risk on appetite while capturing more profit AND still increasing DC.   As I have suggested before - there are many reasons to have multiple vaults on the same asset class.   This is a classic example where a higher LR and a slightly lower rate might be prudent to allow DC expansion as it reduces and allows some management of the liquidation point risk profiles in a way that makes more sense than just using a single vault.
