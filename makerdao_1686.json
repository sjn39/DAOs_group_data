Last month I participated in an online event called Governance Learning Forum 2022, organized by Orca Protocol (recently rebranded to Metropolis) and Other Internet. It had over 100 DAO governance thinkers and doers participating, and I tried to represent MakerDAO to my best ability. It ended up being incredibly fun, relevant and insightful so I felt obliged to share a write-up with some take-aways.  Contextualizing the event Starting off with some context; the two-day event started with a common check-in, upon which smaller breakout groups were formed to listen to a lecture from an expert outside of the web3 context, followed by a collaborative session and discussion based on the subject-matter. On both days the groups I was part of ended up using MakerDAO as reference and focus for the discussion as it turned out to be the most interesting and relevant example in the space. This alone was affirming\u2014it made once again realize that we are pioneering and that our problems are a worthwhile cause to work on, although hard and sometimes frustrating. The whole web3 space is actively learning and benefitting from our process. Below I\u2019ll share some insights and concepts from day 2 that I found interesting and relevant. The lecturer was Tanisi from an organisational design studio called The Ready. Participants in the working group came from Aave DAO, Avantgarde Finance (previously Melon), FWB and more. I would be happy to elaborate when requested.  Relevant insights  Foundational agreements in organisational design We spent a lot of time talking about foundational agreements, which have been discussed within MakerDAO as a \u2018constitution\u2019. During the event we framed foundational agreements as an organization\u2019s operating system, consisting of a set of principles that are defined and ratified by its community. It serves as a Schelling point in governance throughout the whole process, from proposal creation to on-chain  vote. On its benefits:  It makes governance more efficient by reducing the design space for governance. Proposal authors will know upfront which principles and practices are to be respected. A constitution can be seen as \u2018enabling constraints\u2019. It serves as a common reference point for the governing body (be it delegates, DVCs, MKR holders or an elected council/board of sorts), making it easier to find consensus on all kinds of matters. It empowers the community to hold the governing body accountable on their decisions.  On its creation process:  Foundational agreements should be drafted and ratified by the organisation\u2019s community, including how they should be used in governance Foundational agreements should be adaptive and evolving as the organisation\u2019s context and composition is also dynamic. They should be revisited periodically, but not too often. Drafting the foundational agreements is best done by a mission-based team, composed of members from various (if not all) stakeholder groups. The team should include a neutral facilitator to support the process. The mission-based team should work informed through stakeholder engagement and governance polls The team should work iteratively, by periodically gauging community sentiment of their iterations through governance polls.   Mental Model: The Waterline One mental model that caught my attention was \u201cThe Waterline\u2019 which prescribes organisations to define a waterline for organisational decision-making. Changes that are made \u2018above the waterline\u2019 of an organisation are reversible and can be iterated on, therefore they warrant an experimental approach. Decisions that are related to changes \u2018below the waterline\u2019 are irreversible and therefore could result in irreparable damage. The organisation\u2019s governing body should respect this dimension in governance by triaging the proposals and discussions accordingly, and by applying a slower and more involved voting process to changes below the waterline. Maker\u2019s governance system design already accounts for this through the separation of off-chain and on-chain governance, but this approach could potentially also be extended to off-chain decisions that can be framed as \u2018below the waterline\u2019 (eg. longer-timeframe decisions affecting Maker\u2019s future and/or brand, decisions related to changing power/influence, related to incentives, etc)  The Circle Model Another model that caught my eye was this organizational map, defining the various roles and teams and their mandates within the organisation. As opposed to a traditional organizational map (which describe direct hierarchy) this model succeeds in clearly mapping out the various governing bodies and their relationships. This could be a useful method for creating more clarity on our organisation\u2019s composition and the concentration of mandate throughout the organisation.

Complicated problems can be hard but are always separable into components that can be solved logically. The relationship between cause and effect requires analysis and expertise.   Complex problems however are hard because they are not fully subject to logic and/or laws\u2014they are related to inherently unpredictable factors such as human behaviour or system dynamics. The relationship between cause and effect can only be perceived in hindsight.   An example of a complicated problem is a software bug which might take forever to solve but can always be explained logically. An example of a complex problem is designing token economics. An organisation should have a different process facing these two types of problems.  Structure in Decentralized Organisations A discussion that inspired me was related to the downsides of fully decentralized organisations without structure. The lecturer argued that although our industry strives for decentralisation from valid intentions, purely \u2018flat\u2019 organisations fail to empower its community. In flat and fully decentralized organisations contributors generally feel lost, lonely, misunderstood and and unlikely to contribute until they are able to garner social capital within that group. It\u2019s not a bad thing to concentrate authority to particular roles within an organisation, as long as checks in balances are in place. This allows the rest of the organization to freely work within that structure without having to \u2018play the social capital game\u2019. This enables deep work and ultimately benefits all. \u2013 Although I don\u2019t have a direct call-to-action for now, I hope the above was informative and inspirational for some. I believe these insights/theories are relevant to MakerDAO\u2019s current state and they might inform @GovAlpha-Core-Unit for future improvements to our governance process, but also provide a process for the potential creation of a constitution later on.
