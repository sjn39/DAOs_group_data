There are a number of reasons why that could have been the case, whether it\u2019s because MKR Token Holders didn\u2019t want the gov-sec module activated, or because the bar set by MKR securing the previous executive was too high, or something else.  The basic trade-off for activating the governance security module is thus: Defence against theoretical crypto-economic attacks by a well-funded attacker vs. Defence against technical smart contract issues. I don\u2019t feel that I\u2019m qualified to judge which of these is more severe. But I\u2019ve heard differing opinions from various people that I would expect to be able to judge the level of these risks, enough so that I am still unsure whether it should be activated. Personally I\u2019m leaning towards yes, we should activate it with the 24 hour delay. This gives us a minimum level of defence against theoretical crypto-economic attacks while still potentially allowing reaction to a technical issue in the Maker Protocol smart contracts. Such an attack only needs to happen once for everything to fall apart. Regardless of the relative likelihoods, the severity of such an attack would be very high especially considering we knew about the possibility and voted against mitigating it. If anyone more able to speak to their judgement of risk here wishes to add their comments, I\u2019d be happy to add them to this initial post.      Yes, we should have another executive vote now. No, we should not have another executive vote yet. Abstain (I just want to see results) Abstain (I have no opinion) Abstain (I don\u2019t feel I am knowledgeable on the subject) Abstain (I disagree with the poll options) Abstain (I have a different objection)     0 voters      This poll will close on 20th February 2020 immediately after the Governance and Risk meeting, this will allow time for governance to take into account new information regarding the \u2018darkfix vehicle.\u2019  Previous statement: I will evaluate the progress of this request on 18th February 2020. At that time, this poll will either be closed, or extended if there has not been a reasonable amount of participation. ",

Given the recent discussion of the darkfix in the last Governance and Risk meeting and the coming information drop from @Wouter I think it\u2019s reasonable to extend this poll by a short amount of time to allow voters to take into account the new information. That said, I am aware that we already have consensus for voting on the GSM once again. I don\u2019t believe that a short extension until Thursday 20th February (post governance meeting) will impact implementation time, and it allows another governance meeting discussion and consumption of documentation. I will update the initial post accordingly. ",

As per this post:  The Governance Security Module mitigates governance attacks by introducing a delay between the activation of the executive, and the actual execution of the code (when the changes are applied.) During this delay, the community can examine the changes that will be applied and react if the changes are deemed malicious.  Though now I wonder if someone could continually change the hat and \u201cddos\u201d the governance system by preventing further changes to pass the delay period. Is the delay for how long it takes for the hat to actually change or for how long the new hat can execute? If the latter, I could keep changing the hat such that no new proposal ever cross the delay and therefore can\u2019t be executed. ",
