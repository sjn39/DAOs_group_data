Paragraph Summary LOVE-001 intends to support the DAO in its evolution towards becoming the central pillar of DeFi by facilitating the sustainable onboarding of tens (or hundreds) of billions of more complex use cases. LOVE-001 will do this by developing state-of-the-art frameworks for internal checks and balances, acting as an additional line of defense within the DAO, and helping to educate the community. As the minter and guardian of DAI, DeFi\u2019s leading truly decentralised stablecoin, MakerDAO enjoys an unparalleled position at the centre of the DeFi ecosystem. With the expansion of blockchain-enabled technology well beyond the realm of crypto trading, Maker\u2019s role as collateralised lender of last resort will need to evolve to adopt more complex use cases that reside both inside and outside the world of smart contracts.  Specification  Motivation In the future, it is not impossible for many of those activities to be abstracted and decentralised outside of the boundaries of the DAO. LOVE-001 wants to help MakerDAO take a leading role in steering the evolution of the industry. The future is not ours to predict, but ours to build together. The creation of additional checks and balances, the facilitation of high-quality working practices, as well as the attraction of experienced talent from several fields of traditional and innovative finance, will be invaluable for the DAO during the next phase of its evolution. LOVE-001 aims at becoming one of those centres of excellence and a source of innovation, with a focus on so-called structured finance activities, by overseeing and supporting all actors involved while improving communication practices and internal processes. There haven\u2019t been more exciting times to join the decentralised finance revolution.  Core Unit ID LOVE-001  Core Unit Name The Lending Oversight Core Unit  Core Unit Mandate  Mission Enforce MakerDAO\u2019s role as the central pillar of the DeFi monetary ecosystem by supporting the onboarding of tens of billions of complex assets and ensuring the alignment of those activities with a sustainable and decentralised risk framework.  Vision In five years time, the successful set-up of LOVE-001 would see MakerDAO develop along the following dimensions:   Coordination: Embracing a sustainable and decentralised operational framework to onboard new complex collateral sets, made of appropriate checks and balances, full information transparency \u2014both internal and external\u2014, and a replication of roles to avoid the emergence of powerful gatekeepers.  Connectivity: Becoming one of the leading ramps into DeFi for institutional capital, MakerDAO can provide a seamless on-ramp opportunity into DeFi to legacy financial institutions of any kind.  Scale: Onboarding of tens of billions of complex lending assets, being those assets either inside or (partially) outside the world of smart contracts.  Resilience: Onboarding without having experienced bad credit losses or destructive events.  Education: Fostering a culture of financial sophistication and open collaboration, while conducting similar initiatives across the DAO (i.e., strategic capital planning, liquidity risk management, transfer pricing, budgeting, etc.)   Strategy Onboarding use cases that aren\u2019t yet (fully) part of the world of smart contracts, or complex use cases in general, comes with a new set of challenges that have sparked wider questions about Maker\u2019s role within the wider monetary and lending stack. In this context, LOVE-001 would be instrumental to make the Vision just described real. The initiatives that would be required to do so would constitute the Strategy of the CU:   Initiative 1: Develop, document, and maintain a high-level and accessible framework to approach new complex collateral sets.  Initiative 2: Set (or help setting) all control frameworks for the internal teams involved, as well as a suggested code of conduct.  Initiative 3: Act as a second line of defence within the DAO for the onboarding, monitoring, and management of those assets.  Initiative 4: Educate and communicate with other CUs and the broader community.  We believe that such a Strategy would immediately address some of the challenges that the DAO is currently facing by improving the quality of the discourse with all counterparties, as well as grow work efficiency and throughput. Initiative 1. As part of its duties, LOVE-001 will maintain a high-level framework. Such a framework intends to document:  MakerDAO\u2019s overarching mission and vision \u2014 within structured financing. Key eligibility criteria to onboard complex collaterals. Processes for both onboarding and ongoing monitoring of those collaterals. Core governance principles. An initial version of the Manifesto constitutes an integral part of LOVE\u2019s application set.  Although this MIP represents the first official piece of communication for LOVE-001, the framework to approach new complex collateral sets will be detailed further through the publication of additional MIPs and other posts. The approved MIP67 has been the first step in this direction; LOVE-001 has collaborated extensively with RWF-001 in this initiative. Initiative 2. This MIP identifies a multi-tiered organisational set-up that could support the onboarding, monitoring, and managing process of structured collaterals, as outlined in a stylised way in the chart below.  1418\u00d7619 550 KB  LOVE-001 will be instrumental within such a framework as it will, beyond codifying and continuously updating the collateral onboarding process:  Publish views on the alignment with the Vision of all internal activities. Oversee and report on the overall credit portfolio concentration. Suggest risk control frameworks for the internal teams, as well as a code of conduct. Act as next line of defence for credit onboarding and monitoring. Communicate with other CUs and with the broader community. Ensure consistency and quality of other incubated CUs together with other parties. Periodically audit the activity of other CUs.  Initiative 3: In assessing the activities performed by other CUs, as well as in providing an extra view on the quality of the submitted complex collateral applications, LOVE-001 will act as an extra line of defence to protect the stability of the DAI. Although no delegation of power away from MKR holders has been envisaged, those holders and their delegates might not have the required bandwidth nor expertise to act without support from the CUs in all occasions. During the early days of the initiative, the extra layer of oversight will act simply as another set of eyes, empowering token holders and delegates with a second opinion on proposals. With the scaling up of activities, however, LOVE-001 (and hopefully LOVE-002, 003, etc.) will become a crucial actor in suggesting that best practice and healthy risk management distribution are improved throughout the community. The chart below exemplifies how the CU could interact with the rest of the ecosystem during a collateral application process.  1382\u00d7714 156 KB  In the future it is not impossible for some or most of those analysis functions to be decentralised to parties that are external to the DAO. Such external underwriters might stake MKR tokens as guarantee, or first-loss capital, in support of their official endorsement of a credit application. Although the decision-making power will remain in the hands of MKR holders, the consultative underwriting process could also be pushed outside. We believe that MakerDAO, through LOVE-001, should play an active part in shaping this decentralisation process. Close to MakerDAO\u2019s core values and vision, LOVE-001 will aim at maintaining the DAO\u2019s commitment to fostering innovation and to supporting the emergence of innovative actors within DeFi. Stimulating innovation while maintaining high underwriting standards is a difficult task, and LOVE-001 intends to play a crucial balancing role in doing so. Initiative 4: The introduction of trustless, automated, smart contracts to the financial ecosystem has enabled explosive composability and the widespread distribution of roles. Although this phenomenon has boosted innovation across the board, it has also made the environment exponentially complex and risky. To this, in the medium term we should add the challenges arising from the co-existence of smart contracts and legacy financial systems. For these reasons, ensuring open communication within the Community, as well as the education of all members on the most important concepts underpinning credit underwriting, will be crucial for the success of all initiatives and for MakerDAO as a whole. LOVE-001 intends to support this via:  Producing educational materials, together with other CUs. Hosting coordination sessions and AMAs among all parties involved (or that should be involved) in the collateral management processes. Hosting open sessions for all Community members . Supporting the incubation of new CUs. Supporting cross-unit strategic initiatives aimed at the continuous evolution of the protocol \u2014 i.e., CU incubation, strategic capital planning, liquidity risk management, transfer pricing initiatives, budgeting, etc. Supporting the emergence of innovative players within DeFi, in accordance with the vision of continuous decentralisation and distribution of responsibilities across the ecosystem.   Roadmap The development of a fully-functional LOVE-001 will happen along a series of stages, as described below:   Phase 0 - Seed (*): Re-engage all contributors, restructure communication channels, start the professionalisation of all working practices.  Phase 1 - Bootstrap (*): Install institutional practices in underwriting and monitoring, homogenise existing conversations with counterparties, kick-off LOVE-001 staffing program, graduate from SES incubation.  Phase 2 - Establish: Operate now a fully-formed LOVE-001, interact with all other CUs involved in onboarding and monitoring of new collateral, support the incubation of new CUs, communicate with internal and external stakeholders.  Phase 3 - Decentralise: As soon as size of business and number of interacting CUs justify it, start a process of further decentralisation of LOVE-001 into parallel units for the avoidance of the creation of single points of failure, enhance and empower the existing team, refine collaborative processes further.  (*) Both the Seed and (part of) the Bootstrap stages have been completed ahead of the submission of this MIP as part of SES incubation program. LOVE-001\u2019s team will evolve in synch, as described in the table below.

                    "content": "Thank you for your comments @flipflopflapdelegate, I will try to answer each of your points.  Credit Risk Appetite     flipflopflapdelegate:  With that in mind\u2013Luca\u2013you and the community agree that credit risk appetite, credit risk strategy and the overall credit risk policy for the benefit of MakerDAO should be aligned with MKR token owners.   The topic of risk appetite is a complex one, on that by the specific nature of the DAO will be difficult to set in stone. At the same time I, as potential LOVE Facilitator, have developed a holistic view of what Maker should strive for:   DAI stability should remain absolute priority - as you know I have joined the community advocating for higher standard of professionalisation, and the recent developments in the stablecoin arena have demonstrated that innovating with caution should be the mantra, since given their own set up stablecoins react abruptly (and negatively) to loss of trust - this mantra is what has inspired the drafting of MIP67 (that refers to real-world use cases), and a similar mindset should be applied to other more complex integrations like the D3Ms, in my opinion  DAI stability should not mean stasis - we remain an innovative protocol and we should always incentivise innovation, but with open eyes - the onboarding of borrowers and structures with growth potential should always be investigated, while trying to size them in accordance with the surplus buffer we have at risk (we don\u2019t want to recreate Goldman Sachs, we want to rewire the financial system and survive while we do it)  Being a bit more pragmatic, as LOVE Facilitator I would not endorse an unproven counterparty or collateral that is in its infancy and is applying for several 100s of MM of DAI of financing, often with little guarantee for the protocol. On the contrary, I would support new projects and borrowers that are innovating their business model and are maturing the way they do business, want to engage with Maker in good faith, are ready to build and eager to learn together. There are many projects like this and I have tens of calls during the last months with those teams. As many in the teams know, I have been a loud proponent of the protocol-to-protocol D3M integration with other lending protocols like Maple or TrueFi - or any other. To clarify, I have no affiliation with those protocols apart from respect for what they want to do. Although those protocols are still in their infancy and cannot be compared to the standards outlined in MIP67, they have the potential to be strategic to Maker\u2019s vision and we should definitely (subject to token holder will) experiment integration in a conservative size. But, again, not with our eyes closed. This barbell approach that includes, on the one hand, large and institutional borrowers (like HVB) and, on the other, innovative protocols or borrowers, should allow Maker to grow while remaining faithful to its core mandate of stability and decentralisation.  Portfolio Composition     flipflopflapdelegate:  and how do you believe the composition of the DAO\u2019s RWA credit portfolio, including its concentration, and diversification objectives in relation to viable business lines, geographies, economic sectors, etc., should be composed?   I believe it might be early to embark in a full portfolio composition effort, but this should absolutely be done as soon as the exposure to both real-world and structured assets grows. Again, when I talk about structured assets, I talk about anything that is more structured than providing financing against a straight token like ETH or wBTC. LOVE will be extremely engaged in doing this, with the help of @Aes and Strategic Finance. A framework will have to be developed to measure portfolio concentration, across both crypto and non-crypto native collateral, as well as duration and risk exposure, and token holders should have the ability to test, stress, and opine on portfolio composition.  Other Questions     flipflopflapdelegate:  How will LOVE-CU determine underwriting limits?       flipflopflapdelegate:  Will you set the tone for RWA Stability Fee recommendations to MKR token owners?   Underwriting limits, as well as stability fee recommendations, will come primarily from Risk and Real-World Finance. In acting as an extra line of defence, however, LOVE will act as a second opinion on all those matters following the risk assessments. For what concerns real-world assets, that are complex and diverse in nature, we would expect counterparties to come forward with their proposal on size and interest / stability fee, backed by market and/ or expert opinions, and that proposal should be the start of the negotiations.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Will your modeling be dependent on the methodologies proposed in MIP67, and when can you see yourself using a null hypothesis and/or an alternative hypothesis when publishing the view of LOVE-CU?   MIP67 is only one of the tools we have to measure counterparties against, but should not in any way be prescriptive for token holders to make their own mind on what should be prioritised. MIP67 intends to give authority to the core units to prioritise collateral that has potential high impact for the protocol, while trying to leave the burden of structuring and documentation to the counterparty. Loyal to the barbell approach described above, this should not avoid young, innovative, and high-potential projects to try and connect to Maker. I am a strong believer of Maker becoming the ultimate provider of secure funding across the whole DeFi ecosystem, with a protocol-to-protocol mindset that could allow us to scale fast and safely. I will remain loyal to this belief while keeping an open mind to update my mental framework.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Are you keen on incorporating ESG factors and associated risks in assessing credit risk appetite and risk management, while adopting keeping perhaps MKR token owners views that the DAO needs a holistic approach?   Absolutely. We want to make the world a better, more affordable, more equitable place. I have little experience on institutional ESG though, as many others in the community, and I would advocate the community to sponsor structured work internally to define the requirements to be considered ESG by Maker. We don\u2019t want ESG to become a shortcut for sub-par collateral to enter the ecosystem, we want to put DAI where is really needed. I hope to have answered your questions, but please feel free to ask for more detail if you need. Luca ",

First of all RWF got an extension of budget that includes mainly an allowance for legal and professional fees - if and only those will be needed, as @christiancdpetersen and @williamr can explain and show what has been spent for real. Secondly, for good checks and balances, as a community member I have always advocated for a split of responsibilities and for the creation of a second line of defence away from the underwriting core unit itself. That is what LOVE intends to do. Second line of defence means also second opinion on things where one unique point of view can be an attack vector - or a vector for excessive prudence. I am sure other members in the community can testify about my level of involvement in settling the vision and the processes to do this. Often the financial benefits of conservatism can be overlooked - but we should have learned it by now. Thirdly, LOVE will not only work with real-world native originators, but also with crypto native originators that are intermediating structured credit, like Maple and TrueF, or other protocols that intend to benefit of Maker\u2019s liquidity in conservative manner, like Notional tried for example. A senior financial oversight of those risk remains of paramount importance. I am sure that the teams will be able to testify my contribution in this space. Ultimately, LOVE intends to be a senior / expert lien of financial oversight across the whole protocol. My experience in finance is extensive, and at the highest level, as you can see here, and such expertise can be leveraged by several other units in the ecosystem. I am sure that @Nadia, @Aes, @hexonaut, and others can describe a bit better my contributions so far. LOVE intends to remain this small, while attracting a couple more people that already have very successful (and profitable) careers outside of DeFi but are moved, like me, by the intention to build and innovate. The compensation of the core unit should be skewed towards participating to MKR upside, rather than capitalising in the short term, and this is what I am trying to transmit through the proposal. The decentralisation of LOVE into parallel core units should, and hopefully will, happen only following an expansion of the need, of the DAI pool, and of the profits generated. I hope I answered your questions, and happy to talk more about this. ",

He\u2019s given us a lot of guidance (along with Maker Growth CU) in terms of the collateral Maker/D3M will like to be supporting. Up to this point, I have viewed Luca as a bit of an extension of BD/partnerships (more precisely a bridge between \u2018Growth\u2019 and \u2018RWF\u2019). He\u2019s been able to speak in-depth about the types of loans/structures/etc. believed to be best/safest for MakerDAO.     Doo_StableLab:  Just curious, if this CU was here and if the team could have talked with TruFi, what would been some changes that the team could have pushed for to better benefit the Maker protocol.   My sense is that most of the benefit from Luca\u2019s proposed CU will come in the coming months as we gear up (hopefully) to go live. As we present MakerDAO with different options for pools/portfolios they could lend DAI to on TrueFi, I expect to be working with Luca/his CU closely in the capacity we might work with a financial risk oversight committee at a bank or credit fund. Perhaps the one addition (from our experience so far in conversations with Luca) is that he balances risk mitigation with a strong commercial sense and push for getting things done. Lastly (and this certainly falls outside the scope of Luca\u2019s CU, but is a testament to his love for DeFi and MakerDAO), I believe Luca has also played the role of evangelizing MakerDAO via his weekly newsletters, which often covers MakerDAO.

For transparency on this matter, the following chart provides a view of forecast vs actuals in terms of RWF-001 CU spending since the start of the year:  The key component is the prudent approach with regards to utilisation of budget for external legal services. Only transactions that are well advanced in post greenlight implementation process may incur external legal costs on the lender side (i.e. Maker) such as SocGen & HVB. The default however is to negotiate early on so borrowers pay lender external legal costs. The intention, already discussed with the auditor of the multisig, is to return unused external legal allowances back to the protocol treasury at regular intervals. Again, we are following the principle of financial/budgetary discipline with expenses which the Community is asking for. ",

Objective of my work has been raising quality standards, providing functionally separated opinions on proposals, helping drafting process MIPS (like MIP67), as well as educating counterparties. I am proud to say that, with the wisdom of hindsight, the raising standards of prudence and professionalism championed by myself and @williamr have helped the DAO remain in the solid position it is now. A lot is still needed, and I\u2019m looking forward to collaborate with you and Risk to offer holistic assessments and process improvements for the collaterals that will come. We are seeing a convergence of the crypto and real-world now with applicants such as Maple, TrueFi, and others. I believe that LOVE will be instrumental in helping orchestrating this convergence. To your specific point, I do know and love the dashboard you guys are maintaining. But it does obviously not cover all relevant risk metrics of any structured / hybrid exposure - that include D3Ms, real-world onboarding, and even structured exposures such as $stETH for which backward looking liquidity analysis is not enough. To be specific in some examples, I am discussing about:  Quality of underlying loan-level valuation of the real-world collaterals constituting a pool (e.g. how solid is 6s\u2019 valuation reported of the underlying real-estate assets?) Credit enhancement mechanisms at the structure level of both off-chain and hybrid structures (what is the quality of the junior equity capital in 6s, in the proposed Monetalis Lusitano structure, in Maple\u2019s Pool Delegate lien, etc.) Analysis of the underlying process and alignment of interest (e.g. is there enough skin in the game and business recourse of parties involved in credit underwriting and distribution for Monetalis Lusitano, what is the ability for Maple\u2019s pool delegates to assess market-neutral trading strategies of the underlying borrowers, etc.?) Market assessment and analysis of the ability to deliver by proposed counterparties (e.g. based on the team experience and bandwidth, what is the ability of a certain counterparty to deploy prudently based on the debt ceiling requested?) Structural product risks (e.g. what are the underlying valuation drivers of $stETH? what is the expected sensitivity of the price dynamics based on liquidity preference of such token vs ETH?)  As you can see, there are several qualitative aspects of lending risk that require a different skill set. And I truly believe that LOVE\u2019s skills would complete Risk\u2019s proven abilities for purely on-chain exposures. I also want to mention again, for the 100th time, that LOVE does not intend to be a decision making core unit, but simply an advisory core unit that tries to deliver to token holders the best possible package and the most complete information set possible. And, at the same time, ensure that counterparties are listened to and the risk of gate-keeping of each directly involved CU is mitigated during the onboarding process. I believe that my personal interactions with Delegates and Token Holders over the last months are testament of this. Thank you for your question, again, Luca ",

                    "content": "I am @cryptonativephd, delegate for London Business School. We are strongly voting in favour of this proposal. We, at London Business School, firmly believe that the Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001) will play an instrumental part in increasing stability in the MakerDAO ecosystem. Over the past few weeks, we have observed how sub-prime collateral can prove to be detrimental with regards to DeFi ecosystems. CeDeFi lenders and major DeFi players have proven to us that we need to keep a close watch on the collateral that we accept to increase the stability of $DAI. The LOVE-001 unit is a key missing piece in the stability puzzle that will allow MakerDAO to become a source of stability in an unstable landscape. The Lending Oversight Core Unit will increase the probability that only high-quality collateral is accepted for the issuance of $DAI. There is definitely a need for LOVE-001. We have put together a list of reasons why we believe LOVE-001 is essential for sustainable growth of the MakerDAO ecosystem:   Eliminating Information Asymmetries: There are integral learnings that we can take from traditional finance \u2013 one of them being the importance of eliminating information asymmetries while assessing an investment opportunity / collateral onboarding opportunity. LOVE-001 seeks to eliminate these asymmetries through supplementing financial activities with structural finance measures of risk assessment.  Need for Devil\u2019s Advocate: Adding onto this, it\u2019s worth noting that the role of devil\u2019s advocate needs to be played in credit allocations. Regardless of the intent of said allocation, an allocation to credit is inherently a risk-seeking bet and thereby should be viewed through the lens of an investment decision. As such, it is imperative that multiple layers of checks as well as the role of devil\u2019s advocate need to exist to ensure that the benefits of the credit allocation outweigh the idiosyncratic risks.  Increased Voter Participation: We have observed that voter participation has been a major problem in DAOs \u2013 with the elimination of information asymmetries, we believe that there will be increased voter participation.  Increased Compliance/Quality Assurance: We believe that over the next decade, DeFi will become a semi-regulated space, and Maker will have an edge in conforming to all local regulatory requirements with the addition of LOVE-001.  Coordination Layer: We are aware that LOVE-001 looks as though it adds a layer of centralization over the otherwise decentralized actors constituting MakerDAO. However, we believe that LOVE-001 still falls in line with the ethos of decentralization, as it will act as an additional hidden layer in the MakerDAO neural network in ensuring that Maker is able to recalculate and readjust the weights of the neurons in the previous layers in the most efficient manner.  Exponential Scaling: LOVE-001 seeks to onboard high-quality institutional collateral allowing MakerDAO to exponentially scale its AuM.  Ensured High-Quality Contribution: As LOVE-001 will be set up by Luca, who brings a decade worth of Investment Banking and Hedge Fund experience, we believe that he will be able to put together a high-quality structural finance unit ensuring great contribution.  Due to a combination of the above aspects, we believe that setting up LOVE-001 will be immensely helpful in the growth of the MakerDAO ecosystem. ",

I have expressed my opinion, opinion that sometimes has been appreciated by token holders sometimes not, simply loyal to my professional and intellectual honesty, even if sometimes it was a discomfortable opinion to carry forward. I have often paid personally for this, but also for this I don\u2019t regret. I obviously learned a lot during my year at Maker, and I hope that I will put my learnings to good use if LOVE will get approved.

Rather than take a shot at a new governance participant, why not take them at their word - that they care about decentralisation - and rebut the arguments they made about why LOVE-001 is good for decentralisation or not (ie, the arguments around decreasing information asymmetries and the \u2018neural net\u2019 analogy). I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t agree with those points and you\u2019re entitled not to, but it\u2019d be a much better discussion if you engaged in those arguments rather than belittle a first-time poster and new delegate.

We view this as a first step towards establishing effective checks and balances for complex collateral onboarding, in addition to enabling more coordination between the various Core Units involved in the real-world collateral underwriting and onboarding process. An official oversight function is a key part of the effort to build more systematic, clear processes so counterparties can fully understand how to engage with MakerDAO. LOVE provides some of those oversight capabilities in a test scenario with the RWF team. Additionally, Luca has been deeply and meaningfully engaged in the MakerDAO community for some time now. He has repeatedly and consistently posted in the forums regarding LOVE in a transparent manner. The MakerDAO Credit Risk Framework he previously authored also provides a clear vision, outline, and proposed process to scale off-chain collateral. LOVE fits well into this framework, and it\u2019s worth onboarding a new, budget neutral core unit, to assist in making it a reality. As with all other functions, we think it will be important to review LOVE\u2019s integration and effectiveness in 6-9 months, and reevaluate its design from there. We further recognize there are deeper ongoing discussions regarding MakerDAO\u2019s organizational design, core strategy, and community philosophy. We plan on posting on these topics separately in the near future. As always, I can be reached here on the forums, on Twitter @_PorterSmith, or via email at [email\u00a0protected]. ",

LOVE CU will be budget neutral, in DAI form, but will have a MKR token incentivisation package. Such MKR incentivisation package has been shaped using the standard MKR vesting tools provided by SES with no dedicated tailoring. When we decided how to structure the remuneration package of this CU, together with SES, we decided to skew it towards MKR rather than DAI, for a few reasons. Mainly, that traditional senior financial professionals have a way too high cash comp in the market and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to ask the same for a scale up like MakerDAO - investment bankers or investment professionals with 10-15 years of experience have cash compensation packages that gravitate around the 1M USD. And, in addition, we wanted those individuals to be completely tied to the long term success of the protocol. Lending and investing decisions are extremely complex and sensitive, and people have learned on their skin the importance of experience. The vesting schedule of the MKR package, as well, is very long-dated - with 1 year cliff and 3 year vesting. I have said many times to everyone that my ambition as professional would have been to help this protocol scale, and then move on to a part-time or advisory basis to leave others continue the job. Hence, I would probably not get the benefit of the package anyway, personally. And this goes without considering the extreme financial sacrifice I incurred working with SES on the incubation of this CU over the last >6 months. I know you didn\u2019t ask for such detail, but I believe this is the right time to give the community some colour, before the vote is over. I also wanted to thank @Porter_Smith for a16z\u2019s endorsement. We have worked transparently and together with most stakeholders at MakerDAO in trying to shape this initiative over the months. It is unfortunate that some large MKR holders in the DAO suddenly disagree with the job done, but I guess it is also testament of the intellectual independence of this potential core unit. Personally, I do not try to pursue absolute truth, but rather the defence of every opinion, and especially those in a minority position. In the long term, it has proven to be a wise thing. Thank you again, Luca ",

                    "content": "Thank you @SelenaPotter, I will try. Vested interests and insiders\u2019 influence is a huge problem at Maker, and in crypto in general. We have a founding team controlling a huge portion of the voting power, and now a few very large funds growing their influence. Including those that have supported this proposal. The direct and indirect effect that this has in the way the protocol is managed is undeniable by any honest mind who spends some time on forum. It\u2019s an important point so I\u2019ll try to give you a deep answer. Procedures. Fighting collusion starts by implementing clear procedures. We aren\u2019t new in this, related parties transactions and conflicts of interest are everywhere in TradFi too. It is not perfect, but we will continue enforcing our requests for true transparency, disclosing conflicts, asking for abstention from voting, recusing from advising if a conflict is internal, or ask for an independent opinion coming from a third party. Related parties transactions can be done, but require extraordinary dedication. I have a (tiny) budget within LOVE for professional services, I intend to use it if the community requires additional scrutiny on selected applications. Realism. Ultimately, we will improve the quality of our industry by expanding and improving the quality of MKR engagement, of CU participation, of community debate. This is a process that will take time. We think that the creation of LOVE, of other teams in the future, the involvement of large holders that do not belong to a single group, go in this direction. As I mentioned many times, I think defending plurality of opinion is the best enabler of good human constructs. Personal note. People will always be subject to influence. It\u2019s unavoidable. By attracting professionals with more experience and personal exposure we might (might) reduce this. I can assure that remaining professional in assessing applications from related parties hasn\u2019t made my life easy - nor this vote. I have seen accusations of pushing a personal agenda at the time of the Monetalis application you refer to, whereas the macroscopic truth that it would have been much better for my life at Maker to bend to clear lobbying from insiders wasn\u2019t mentioned. I will also remind the community that such transaction was ultimately judged by a plurality of token holders and delegates, and LOVE and RWF merely provided their assessment - although vocally, as vocal were the voices of the proponents and their stakeholders. I have stood for professionalism because after 15 years in the finance sector, operating with my own name, I have learned the long term importance of credibility. Everything is in the open for us to see. I am confident that the backers of this proposal will have the same view on remaining respectful of checks and balances. If they don\u2019t, I will do my best, as I hope other CU and community members will, to try to compensate it. ",

Rune has brought and lobbied heavily for collateral where he was a stakeholder, and incubating LOVE and RWF have remained professional and asked for transparency and market standards. I think this is a point in favour of LOVE/ RWF when it comes to managing conflict, not so sure about Rune. On washing hands I am not so sure either, MetaDAOs are attack vectors for DAI liquidity that will require the same level of scrutiny, as well as protocols engaging for a programmatic D3M-like integration. Let\u2019s wait to see how myself, if (big if) voted in, will act as facilitator, how the other teams will behave, and how the potential conflicted parties will behave. Then we can engage in constructive disagreement over professional practices. I do believe that my behaviour so far has been appreciated on the matter, even by some delegates who have voted down the proposal. I hope I will continue to keep the standards of the CU high, and if not you guys are here to remind it to me. Thanks for your continuous engagement. ",
