Issuer: India Power Corporation Limited, with its registered office in Kolkata, India (IPCL, the Company or India Power). Advisor to IPCL: Oasis Pro Markets LLC (together with its affiliates, Oasis Pro)  Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  Real World Asset Proposed: One or more senior secured fixed rate bonds or other indebtedness (Bonds) secured by collateral with full recourse to IPCL, ranking pari passu with other senior secured debt of IPCL. Description of Collateral: Subject to further review and discussion among credit and legal, IPCL and Oasis Pro.  Provide a brief history of the project.  This MIP6 is submitted by Oasis Pro, as advisor to IPCL. IPCL has its registered office in Kolkata, India. The Company was granted a license to distribute electricity across 771 sq. kms. in Asansol - Ranigunj areas of West Bengal in 1932 and since then the Company has been a dedicated power supplier to the region, driving economic and social growth by supplying quality power to government utilities, hospitals, industries, mines, commercial and domestic consumers. As of financial year 2020-21, the Company distributes electricity over a license area of 771 sq. kms.   The Company has transformed itself through modern technology such as SCADA, IoT enabled Distribution Transformer health monitoring, AMR / Prepaid enabled meters, 24x7 call centre and data analytics, online prepaid recharge facilities for almost all the customers. IPCL has also interest into generation of electricity primarily through renewable energy sources. Current Portfolio includes total generation capacity of around 39 MW comprising 24.8 MW from wind asset in Gujarat, 2 MW from solar assets in West Bengal and 12 MW from thermal power plant at Asansol, West Bengal. The Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary MP Smart Grid Private Limited is engaged in executing a first-of-its-kind public-private partnership that involves installation and operation & maintenance of 350,000 smart meters across five towns of Madhya Pradesh under a contract awarded by one of the Madhya Pradesh state owned Discom. In addition to the end- to-end installation of smart meters in consumer residences, the project also requires establishment of sophisticated technology infrastructure with an operation and maintenance mandate for a period of five years. According to Indian Renewable Energy Industry Report by IBEF (India Brand Equity Foundation), the Indian renewable energy sector is the fourth most attractive renewable energy market in the world according to Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness index 2018 by EY. India was ranked fifth in wind power, fifth in solar power and fourth in renewable power installed capacity, as of 2019. Installed renewable power generation capacity has been climbing steadily over the past few years, growing at a CAGR of 17.33% between financial years 2016-20. The primary objective for deploying renewable energy in India is to advance economic development, improve energy security, improve access to energy, and mitigate climate change. Strong government support and the increasingly opportune economic situation have pushed India to be one of the top leaders in the world\u2019s most attractive renewable energy markets. Despite Covid-19 pandemic, more than 260 GW (gigawatts) of renewable energy capacity was added globally in 2020, beating previous record by almost 50%. More than 80% of all new electricity capacity added last year was renewable, with solar and wind accounting for 91% of new renewables. Nearly everywhere in the world, producing electricity from new renewables is more cost effective than producing it from new coal-fired power plants. Renewables also are outcompeting new natural gas-fired power plants on cost in many locations, and are the cheapest sources of new electricity generation in countries across all continents (excluding Antarctica). Through technology innovations and economies of scale, the global wind power market has nearly quadrupled in size over the past decade and established itself as one of the most cost-competitive and resilient power sources across the world. Covid-19 has reinforced the need for a greener and cleaner environment with more emphasis on quality of life. India Power is committed to fulfilling the growing energy requirements of a developing India in a sustainable and smart manner. The Company is committed to accelerate its investment in renewable energy over the coming years and presently projects a green energy mix to around 70% by financial year 2024. Sustainability is at the core of IPCL\u2019s mission to improve the quality of life and the environment. The Company has also crafted various sustainable and smart business models for the rollout of AMI projects in the country. IPCL envisages delivering on the ambitious vision planned by the Government of India of having installed over 250 million smart meters in the next five years. Out of the total proposed implementation of 250 million smart meters by Govt. of India, IPCL targets to secure contracts for implementation of about 5 million smart meters in phased manner over next 3-5 years under the various on-going/ upcoming PPP based bids for the distribution companies across India. IPCL is evaluating the various tenders floated by the Discoms across the India that are under process and under pipeline, and targeting to secure contracts which are available as immediate opportunity in near to medium term. It is also focusing on development of renewable energy portfolio of ~ 300 MW over a period of 3 years. IPCL is advanced stage of land acquisition and execution of binding agreements with potential procurers. India Power aspires to be committed towards powering the future with sustainable energy. A few of the Company\u2019s recent achievements to generate renewable energy sources and reduce carbon emissions from existing fossil fuels and generate renewable energy sources are: \u2022\tOne of the first private power utility to sign a Power Purchase Agreement with Solar Energy Corporation of India for purchase of 100 MW renewable hybrid power. Partial supply under this Power Purchase Agreement has already been commenced. \u2022\tSign a Power Purchase Agreement with Solar Energy Corporation for purchase of 100 MW Round-the-clock (RTC) renewable energy. \u2022\tAdvanced Metering Infrastructure, pre-paid metering and SAP system implemented. \u2022\tImplemented SCADA, Gas Insulated Substation, 24x7 Online Distribution Transformer health monitoring through IoT. \u2022\tEnergy efficiency through well distributed transformers and capacitor banks. \u2022\tLong Term Power Sale Agreement of 40.5 MW Power from its upcoming Solar PV Project. Wind power The Company has over a decade of experience in operating wind energy projects. The renewable portfolio of the Company is as follows:     State District Project Capacity Commercial Operation Date PPA Term and Authority Tariff \u20b9/kWh     Gujarat Rajkot, Jamnagar and Kutch 24.8 MW March 2007 20 Years \u2013 executed with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited 3.37    \u2022\tThe Company operates the wind project on an asset-light model, wherein, it exclusively administers the wind farms for a fixed lease payment. \u2022\tProject has secured long term PPA. \u2022\tThe Company ensures energy availability of above 90% and a Plant Load Factor of over 18%. Solar power  West Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation Limited in association with the Company set up a 2 MW Photo Voltaic solar power plants in Jamuria, West Bengal. Power generated from this solar plant is directly fed into the Company\u2019s Distribution License area at Asansol. The solar plant has helped to reduce 0.7 metric tons of CO2 emission per day. India Power was the first to cross the Megawatt threshold in solar and connect a solar power plant to a power grid. India\u2019s energy landscape is changing quickly on many fronts and the pace of these changes is likely to only accelerate over the coming years. As India looks to meet its energy demand on its own, which is expected to reach 15,820 TWh by 2040, renewable energy is set to play an important role. The government is aiming to achieve 227 GW of renewable energy capacity (including 114 GW of solar capacity addition and 67 GW of wind power capacity) by 2022, more than its 175 GW target as per the Paris Agreement. India\u2019s renewable energy sector is expected to attract investment worth US$ 80 billion in the next four years.

I am going to combine some thoughts in one long post to get everybody thinking. Really excited both by the prospect of doing business in India and in enabling greening there. Please excuse any and all misconstruals.  Drafting off of @numair\u2019s point about comparable transactions, see below for a side-by-side of the Brickworks and IREDA ratings scales. The equivalent IREDA rating for a Brickwork BRW A- would be A- (for State Gencos/Transcos), suggesting an annual coupon of 8.20%. Please provide some detail as to why the 8.20% rate is not applicable to IPCL.  Brickworks Rating Scale  1586\u00d7878 240 KB  IREDA Ratings (2022 data)  1390\u00d7458 66 KB  Brickworks IPCL Rating: Long-term debt rated BWR A-, NCD rated BWR A-  Screen Shot 2022-04-13 at 9.27.31 AM1206\u00d7772 188 KB   Continuing along a similar line of inquiry, on page 5 of the Brickworks rating report on IPCL, a debt instrument with shelf NCD-II is outstanding to IPCL. See the subject instrument screen-shotted below. NCD-II, which presumably refers to the second issuance by IPCL of non-convertible debentures (NCD) has two international securities identification numbers (similar to CUSIPS), suggesting private or public issuance.   One of these issuances has 8 Crores ($86MM) in principal outsanding and a September 19, 2022 maturity.This appears to be the debt the MakerDAO is refinancing with its potential $120MM origination. Is this in fact the case? These notes are clipping 12% coupons. What is the rationale behind why MakerDAO\u2019s notes will yield 8-12x lower? Especially in the case we that are literally refinancing 12% debt? Who (broadly: PPE, private debt fund, etc.) refinanced the note (INE360C07096) maturing as of September 19, 2021 and at what rate?  We do recognize that rates have changed since September of 2012, both in India and elsewhere. Short End: It seems that the Reserve Bank of India has dropped its benchmark from about 8% in September 2012 to 4% in December 2021. Long End: The Indian 10-year bond was clipping 6.71% in September 2012 and is clipping 7.22% as of April 4th. Neither movements in the short-end or long-end seem to support the lower yields being offered to Maker. I am of course missing information on spreads. BrickWorks Rating on IPCL NCD-II  1268\u00d7282 85.2 KB       The Company was granted a license to distribute electricity across 618 sq. kms. in Asansol - Ranigunj areas of West Bengal in 1932\u201d.  As a lender, we need not only consider the likelihood that our debt is serviced adequately (by IPCL\u2019s rights to distribute over the term of the loan) but the likelihood that our loan can be refinanced. The \u201ctake-out\u201d lender will want a similar guarantee that his or her loan will be serviced by distribution rights extending into the future. When does this license to distribute expire?  Some questions about the nature of the collateral and potential agreements between creditors:   Based on the wording, our collateral could be any number of things (four options). Does this mean that IPCL has given OPM the remit to negotiate with MakerDAO as to what its security interests entail? It seems, based on the inclusion of \u201cpari passu\u201d, that most of these assets are already encumbered. Does the lender who refinanced the NCD-II note expiring in 2021 have first liens in place against ALL of the collateral options (sans the 4th)? If not, who will Maker be pari with? Do IPCL\u2019s current long and short-term bank lines have security interests in the same assets that MakerDAO would? If not an existing lender, is the $120MM being offered to MakerDAO part of a broader shelf of bonds being offered to the market? Is the rate being offered to MakerDAO equivalent to the rate on pari party\u2019s (whether existing or future) debt?       [To further its green and renewable energy efforts, the proceeds of the Bonds will be used to (a) fund smart metering broadly that results in the reduction of fossil fuel usage, (b) increase the use of renewable energy sources and (c) refinance existing debt.] [additional detail to come].\u201d   Looking forward to additional details. Though admirable directionally, the specifics of the implementation will be helpful to understand. Putting the proceeds used to refinance existing debt aside, should MakerDAO think about this as an opportunity to provide IPCL with general working capital for achieving 40% renewable energy by 2024? Or are there specific and verifiable initiatives (such as smart meter deployment) that MakerDAO credit will go towards?   I dug up another ratings report, done by Care Edge ratings, on IPCL from October 2020. It differs a bit from the report done by Brickworks in March 2021, six months later. See below: https://www.careratings.com/upload/CompanyFiles/PR/India%20Power%20Corporation%20Limited-10-13-2020.pdf    Screen Shot 2022-04-13 at 9.41.22 AM1584\u00d7864 99.5 KB  On every facility type, \u201cLong Term Bank Facilities\u201d, \u201cShort Term Bank Facilities\u201d, and \u201cNon-Convertible Debentures\u201d, Care is more critical of IPCL than Brickworks. See comparison below:  Long Term Bank Facility: Brickworks BWR A- (low credit risk), CARE BBB (credit watch with negative implications, moderate credit risk) Short Term Bank Facility: BWR A2 (low credit risk), CARE A3 (credit watch with negative implications, moderate credit risk) Non-Convertible Debentures: Brickworks BWR A- (low credit risk), CARE BBB (credit watch with negative implications, moderate credit risk)  I don\u2019t know enough about the ratings landscape in India to comment.

When my colleagues have looked at putting together energy deals backed by PPAs,  the creditworthiness of the counterparty has been a critical factor. MakerDAO will also want to see the actual PPAs to determine when these entities can back out of paying the agreed-upon rate, what their credit ratings look like, and so on. There is a big difference between the unconditional PPAs signed by companies such as Google, and those you get from a local factory.  Latham & Watkins has represented issuers in several public green bond issuances and will be used to structure the Bonds. In particular, it has represented several Indian power and energy companies with their public secured and unsecured green bond issuances.  Can Latham provide deal docs for these past transactions?

In addition to the more specific comments below, a brief summary of the incubating LTS core unit\u2019s high level observations:   OPM and IPCL will need to provide more detail on the mechanics of the debt repayment. Understanding the Reserve Bank of India approval process, as noted by OPM, will be critical (presumably this will be an \u201cexternal commercial borrowing\u201d for purposes of the Reserve Bank of India).   A better understanding of Indian withholding tax on interest payments made offshore is required.   Will the lending entity (the ADGM entity) require registration in India?   We will need to undertake a more extensive due diligence of the overall collateral package and understand the lender\u2019s rights and remedies upon enforcement against the collateral. While India has recently improved in respect of enforcement of contracts and recovery rates, its historical record compared to other jurisdictions is weak.

How private credit is evolving in India   OPM and IPCL will need to propose a security/collateral agent in India to act for the lender for the assets to be collaterally pledged.   Will this proposed loan share collateral with other IPCL senior secured indebtedness? If so, we will need to understand if there will be a common collateral security agreement, the terms, and constraints on unilateral action in the event of a default.   IPCL to confirm that its equity is not owned by the Government of India such that it would subject IPCL to the World Bank negative pledge covenant.   This deal may take time to close because of some of the issues described above and below.       OasisProTeam:  Description of Collateral: Subject to further review and discussion among MakerDAO credit and legal, IPCL and Oasis Pro.    Additional information on the collateral to secure the bonds is required.      OasisProTeam:  MakerDAO\u2019s legal counsel, North Lakes Legal PLLC, would review such documentation and set up any new ADGM or other legal entity to invest in the Bonds, with assistance from Latham & Watkins (or other external counsel) if necessary.    It would be helpful if OPM (or Latham) could do the actual work to establish the ADGM entity. I am happy to provide guidance, suggestions, support, etc., but this should not be a direct activity of North Lakes Legal.      OasisProTeam:  Note, while this MIP6 contemplates an ADGM entity as the investor of record for the Bonds, after further assessment of tax, regulatory and other legal issues, it may be determined that the investor of record should be domiciled in another jurisdiction.    Agree that the jurisdiction for the investor of record will be an important factor to determine in the 1st instance. Any analysis will need to account for the flexibility afforded by the particular jurisdiction, governing law, and an analysis of the tax consequences of payments from India to this jurisdiction (assuming some level of withholding tax and need for gross-up).      OasisProTeam:  The payment obligations of India Power under the Bonds shall, save for such exceptions as may be provided by applicable law and subject to the covenants and undertakings set out in the final agreements governing the Bonds    We will need to understand and review the covenants and undertakings. Also, what is the anticipated \u201capplicable law\u201d? Will the bonds be English law governed?      OasisProTeam:  Also, certain currency transactions and payments may need Reserve Bank of India review and/or consent.    It is very helpful that OPM is flagging this point. Reserve Bank of India review and/or consent may be a gating issue for this transaction. We will need to fully understand this process. OPM\u2019s selection of Latham & Watkins as external counsel will be very helpful in this regard. I have direct experience with Latham & Watkins on dealing with similar issues in my prior roles and Latham and Watkins is well versed on this topic.      OasisProTeam:  It is anticipated that North Lakes Legal will perform the necessary assessments for this MIP,    North Lakes Legal (acting for the incubating LTS) can only prepare a legal risk assessment. The other core units will prepare their respective risk assessments.      OasisProTeam:  taking all actions deemed necessary to perfect any security interest (by way of security transfer or title transfer)    I would expect the borrower to complete the steps necessary to perfect the security interest. Of course, the incubating LTS will make assessments from the Maker perspective.      OasisProTeam:  taking any and all other actions deemed reasonable and necessary to complete the transaction described herein    The incubating LTS is not a party to the transaction, so this is a bit broad.      OasisProTeam:  including the engagement of internationally-recognized legal counsel to advise for the benefit of MakerDao.    Yes, subject to external firm due diligence requirements. This remains an on-going challenge, but I continue to push firms forward on this issue.      OasisProTeam:  collateral may include: [a first ranking pari passu mortgage over all immovable property of India Power [specific projects, property plant or equipment], (2) a first ranking pari passu charge over all movable (tangible and intangible) assets and current assets, receivables, book-debts, cash flows and related account of the India Power in relation to [specific projects, property plant or equipment], (3) a first ranking pari passu charge over the rights and benefits of India Power and its subsidiaries under [certain project documents] (including, power purchase agreements, engineering, procurement and construction contracts, operation and maintenance contracts, clearances and authorizations, insurance contracts, letters of credit and performance bonds) and (4) a first ranking pledge by India Power over certain equity shares of [its controlled subsidiaries/specific subsidiaries]].    Subject to more comprehensive due diligence. However, a security interest in India-based assets will require the presence of a security/collateral agent in India. Has OPM considered potential security/collateral agents in India and such agents willingness to engage in a transaction indirectly involving the Maker protocol?  ",

Of course, the incubating LTS will make assessments from the Maker perspective.    Yes, that is what we anticipate as well. OPM and ATDC would request advice from Latham and India local counsel.

Since then rating exercises have been conducted by CARE.   While their process states that, publishing of rating outcome can be done only after providing the Borrower a reasonable opportunity to examine the draft of the same so that any factually incorrect information is not published, CARE went ahead with publishing of rating outcome despite the non-acceptance communicated to CARE which was in clear violation and breach of the terms of the rating agreements entered into with the Company.   Accordingly, the Company has ceased any communication/ correspondence with CARE.   Citing the violation of rating agreement, the Company approached the Civil Court, Kolkata praying for removal of CARE\u2019s publication showing incorrect/false information. The Company obtained a favourable interim order from the Civil Court which restrained CARE from further publishing of rating outcome by CARE. However, CARE continued publishing the rating outcome which constitutes contempt of court.   Currently, the Company is working towards exiting from rating agreement with CARE which requires approval from lenders group. NOC in this regard has already been obtained from 3 out of 6 lenders. Balance approvals are under process.   In view of the above, ratings from CARE should not be relied upon or given due consideration as they do not reflect the correct and present picture of the Company\u2019s financial strength.   ",

This refers to the October 2020 ratings report? So in 2020, on the basis that CARE mischaracterized fundamentals of its business, IPCL sought to terminate its agreement with the credit agency?

I am not enthusiastic about diverting the precious time and resources of our CUs to comb through all of this information without there being a pre-diligenced and comprehensive term sheet, structure, etc. etc. proposed for us to react to. I am not in favor of either MIP6s progressing. Given the jurisdictions, legal, political and sanctions risk involved, I cannot see a scenario where the collateral and credit support proposed provide any security whatsoever for MakerDAO in the event of a default.

Thank you for pointing this out. Regulatory risk + significantly below market rates, seem like a bad combination. What am I missing here? I love the project in general and green energy in emerging markets is surely a great spot for MakerDAO to be in. But beyond ticking some boxes, projects have to have a strong economic rationale. ",

                    "content": "Because voting activity on the greenlight poll has already been significant, I\u2019ll go ahead and issue a recommendation. I would\u2019ve preferred to give @OasisProTeam the opportunity to respond to my ratings-related question but token holders deserve a timely and (hopefully) qualified opinion. Recommendation: No greenlight As structured, this opportunity appears to provide poor risk-adjusted return to the protocol. The proposed interest rate is below the risk-free rate (US treasuries) of similar duration. An on-market rate might be in the ballpark of 6.5-9%, but we\u2019d need more time to comp it out precisely . Because OPM has made it clear that the proposed terms were not indicative, but rather a \u201cjumping off point\u201d for discussions between MakerDAO and IPCL, I encourage readers to consider the remainder of this recommendation with more weight. Given that the debtor is a large Indian utility and the creditors with which MakerDAO will have pari passu interests in collateral are presumably Indian, the likelihood of recovery upon credit erosion is low. Any recoveries will likely require recourse to the Indian courts. This will be time consuming and there is not any assuredness of recovery. Further, while OPM is aware of the issue, a potential execution risk for IPCL may be the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s material requirements for \u201cExternal Commercial Borrowings\u201d. This will be an issue that OPM and IPCL will have to work through and may delay timely implementation. Finally and in my opinion, most critically, deals of this nature, whether green or EM or strategic or anything else, will require a large up-front cost from MakerDAO core units with limited opportunity to scale. Rather than a wholesale lending relationship where we underwrite the underwriter and deploy more liquidity as he/she performs, this opportunity is more of a one-off. Even if this is the first in a deep bench of opportunities to finance greening with IPCL or even to kick-start the renewables revolution in India, we are not financing an underwriter, but rather forced to underwrite each asset ourselves. To me, such an arrangement is antithetical to success for MakerDAO as a lean protocol that builds financial primitives with infrastructural leverage. Again, I\u2019d like to repeat: it seems to me the mismatch between the subject transaction and MakerDAO is more a testament to MakerDAO\u2019s peculiarities than it is any intrinsic weaknesses of the deal. OPM has been sensitive to the zeitgeist in the forums and proposed an interesting green-related deal with a fairly strong counter-party in a critical and appealing emerging market. I commend their efforts.   Opportunities:     India: Opportunity to create a financing bridge with India, a key demographic, entrepreneurial, and economic engine of the world.      Greening: Focus on smart-metering and renewables offtake.      Infrastructure: Establish a lending practice in Asia.      Platform: Opportunity to partner with a new arranger, Oasis Pro Markets. OPM may offer an appealing tokenization solution for real world assets and is one of a few entities to obtain an Alternative Trading System (ATS) license. This allows its subscribers to trade blockchain securities.      Threats:     Sharpe Ratio: The return on the proposed five-year note is below that of a two-year US treasury.      Recovery Difficulty: Likelihood of recovery upon non-performance is uniquely low.      Credit Hairiness: Recent credit reports have indicated an erosion of IPCL creditworthiness as of 2020. IPCL holds that the rating agency, CARE, violated its credit ratings agreement and mischaracterized key facts. I note this not because I know exactly what has or hasn\u2019t transpired but rather as muck that exists and should be illuminated.      Limited Scaleability: This is a one-off opportunity rather than a programmatic one with an underwriter.      I believe OPM could turn out to be a great partner for MakerDAO, but I don\u2019t believe this formulation is the most productive version of that partnership. ",
