Three of the points which should be discussed are:  Is WBTC, in principle, an asset that should one day be added to MCD, with some reasonable choices of risk parameters? Will adding WBTC as collateral in the very near future, with some reasonable choice of risk parameters, lead to DAI issuance against it which would increase the supply of DAI on the marketplace and help materially to ease the premium over $1.00. If yes, then which risk parameters should be chosen to avoid exposing the system to excessive risk while still ensuring sufficient DAI issuance?  For (3), the risk parameters that should be discussed are:  Debt ceiling Liquidation rato Stability fee Auction parameters  ",

                    "content": "To kick this off by giving my view on my own questions:   BTC is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation and trading volume, and has the most robust financial ecosystem. Custodial BTC tokens like WBTC are one way of securing BTC collateral on the Ethereum blockchain for use with MCD. Accessing BTC collateral via such a token allows MakerDAO to tap into a previously inaccessible market with massive size, even when compared to ETH. In particular, the size of the BTC-collateralised lending market is many times that of ETH, and open interest on BTC futures and swaps products is currently at almost $2.5b (while ETH futures and swaps total around $450mm), which evidences the demand for financing and leverage from BTC holders. Custodial assets like WBTC carry with them a new set of risks, which should be addressed by analysis of the custodian and the creation/redemption processes, and by setting a conservative debt ceiling to minimise exposure to any single custodian (or to a certain class of custodians). BitGo is one of the most reputable custodians in the cryptocurrency industry.   I believe that it will. My evidence for this is:  the sizes of the BTC lending, margin trading, and derivatives markets relative to those of our current largest collateral type, ETH. In principle, this means that there could be 5 BTC leverage-seekers for each ETH leverage-seeker (in $ terms). No other asset, that is currently under emergency consideration or otherwise, comes close to BTC and ETH on this scale if WBTC is added with a low stability fee (aiming to be level with or lower than the prevailing market borrowing rates for USD against BTC collateral), an attractive carry trade opens up where someone can lend USD against BTC collateral on the lending markets, financed by DAI issued from a WBTC CDP at a lower interest rate. This carry trade puts sell pressure on DAI/USD. There is an analogous basis trade using futures or perpetual swaps (or even the upcoming dYdX BTC perpetual swap). speaking to traders and lenders who believe that with WBTC added as collateral, there will be a compelling case for BTC leverage seekers to mint WBTC for use in CDPs to take advantage of lower rates.    I\u2019d like to initially propose the following risk parameters for discussion:  150% Liquidation ratio comment: our best heuristic for the volatility and liquidity properties of BTC is ETH  1% Stability fee comment: the stability fee must match or be lower than market borrowing rates in order to incentivise BTC holders to convert to WBTC and use CDPs  10mm DAI debt ceiling comment: our main control for mitigating custodian and redemption risk is the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling must be sufficiently high to allow DAI supply to increase to an extent where it would materially affect the market price. I think even with 5mm DAI minted it would serve as a valuable policy tool in this situation, so I would enthusiastically support a proposal where the debt ceiling was set lower as well.  All auction parameters/systems borrowed from the current parameters for WETH (including post-black thursday changes and in particular including the liquidation circuit breaker). BTC/USD oracles should be used for the price of WBTC. There is already a data model in setzer for BTC/USD. comment: same as with liquidation ratio, our best estimate for the BTC market is the ETH market     ",

Consider this my support if the community is willing to bear the centralization risk. As with USDC, this risk can be mitigated somewhat by adding in other BTC-backed and tracked collateral types later. wBTC has been around for a while, and is generally less volatile than ETH or some of the other collateral types that have been discussed. I get the sense that people are looking for something safer than ETH in the current climate, and BTC has held up remarkably well through the downturn. A quick squint at the smart contract reveals it\u2019s a pretty standard ERC-20, so there shouldn\u2019t be any roadblocks to the technical implementation. Despite current low liquidity of wBTC on global markets, demand from the protocol likely will cause more BTC to be wrapped to satisfy demand. ",

I think CoinList and Deversifi have been mentioned here before, but I want to echo that wrapping and unwrapping of WBTC has become significantly more convenient and scalable over the past couple months because of these initiatives.

Just a summarising note: Mariano and Cyrus make the pertinent point that we need to make sure there are a viable and sustainable ways to run keepers for wBTC. This mostly means recognising that keepers always need DAI-in-the-hand in order to participate in the next round of collateral auctions. While this is easy with ETH (Oasis, Uniswap etc), it is more complicated with wBTC. This is exacerbated by the potential need to go through something like Coinbase on the BTC chain (if all liquidity and financing have dried up), which can increase confirmation times drastically and push the 6hr auction time uncomfortably close. That said, I think a 10mm DC is reasonable enough, even given the above. Please feel free to correct/add to my summary if need be. ",

Unwrapping is done instantaneously (we wait for 15 ETH blocks to credit the WBTC, so ~ 2minutes there, unwrapping is instantaneous) and BTC is credited in Keeper\u2019s CoinList BTC wallet.

There is an analogous basis trade using futures or perpetual swaps (or even the upcoming dYdX BTC perpetual swap)   Encouraging too much rates and basis trading is not without risks:  If the BTC collateralized lending rates and/or swaps/futures funding rates decline due to lower market confidence, these vault holders would rush to exit the trade.

I agree that there are stability implications from unwinding basis trades, which we ought to consider, and are inherent to any lending market. These concerns apply to the existing ETH collateral type, though presumably anyone who has wanted to put such trades on has had plenty of time to, so we could assume that this potential is close to exhausted until market conditions change. I think having the DAI supply increase now due to borrowing against WBTC, only to be contracted later if conditions change, probably puts us in not much worse a position than if we hadn\u2019t issued the WBTC DAI in the first place, provided the debt ceiling was under control, don\u2019t you think? In general I think we should treat the WBTC SF similarly to the one for ETH. ",

I believe that the debt ceiling is the parameter that should be used to manage these risks. If WBTC collateral ends up being effective at increasing the DAI supply, and further easing is still required, the community can consider increasing the debt ceiling further. I am also expressing approval of a stability fee that is up to 2% above that of ETH, since I think any higher would reduce the effectiveness of WBTC as an emergency collateral type to boost DAI supply. All other parameter choices are justified in my original comment above. ",

We are a WBTC merchant and have been for a while. Over the last few months, we have seen WBTC liquidity improve significantly, and the utility increase for WBTC as well. For a while, WBTC suffered from the chicken and egg problem, but as more dapps have built support and markets for WBTC, we have seen good growth in the product. Having worked with Kiarash at Bitgo throughout the process, I can say they take security very seriously, and we have slept fine holding WBTC in our wallets. I voted for the highest debt ceiling, but I think anything greater than five million is sufficient since that can always be changed later. As for the LR, I believe the same is fine. I don\u2019t see any particular reason to choose something else. For simplicity, I think keeping the SF the same as ETH is good to start. I don\u2019t have a strong opinion or knowledge about the auction parameters, but I would guess the ETH ones are good. The V2 oracle data should be fine as well, I don\u2019t see a reason to change it, but I am open to hearing thoughts. Overall, I think WBTC would be a great addition. A lot of large ether holders also have bitcoin, and in my experience, they are happy to put those coins to work. ",

                    "content": "I think adding WBTC with a lower debt ceiling shouldn\u2019t harm Maker at this point, but I remain a bit sceptic of its usage. Although this isn\u2019t related to risk evaluation, I still want to point out:   if there\u2019s not much demand for WBTC, why would there be more demand for leveraged WBTC (apart from carry trade Lev mentioned, which relies on low SF).   I don\u2019t believe such product is attractive to bitcoines trading leveraged BTC on Bitmex or some other centralized venue and it remains questionable to me if they are willing to trade exchange counterparty risk for a) lower liquidity b) smart contract risk c) WBTC counterparty risk. You could though claim same for ETH in the first place, but ETH has much higher liquidity with DAI and no counterparty risk.   if people want to make leveraged BTC positions on ethereum, they will more likely trade new dydx 10x perpetual BTC futures which should have less slippage with USDC pair. Sure, some may prefer to use more decentralized version of it on Maker, but WBTC itself carries counterparty risks anyway.   we haven\u2019t seen much usage on Aave, although I wouldn\u2019t necessarily use Aave as a benchmark.   WBTC vault owners should have high confidence in WBTC DAI liquidity in order to use it, but it remains low until it\u2019s being used at Maker and we have chicken and egg problem.   In terms of risks, obviously a detailed analysis should be made but here are crucial parts for me, at least when addressing core risk components (liquidity, volatility, counterparty risk):   even though WBTC is redeemable and issued on demand, low liquidity (at the moment) may cause problems for vaults when trying to quickly unwind positions in BTC price drop scenario. There isn\u2019t a lot of WBTC traded currently, the most liquid venue is the new Ethfinex exchange called DeversiFi, but it\u2019s with USDT pair. Other DEXes such as Uniswap and Kyber see $50k-$100k volume per day.   redemption cycle is quite long (includes many steps + BTC confirmation time). This is not a general problem if WBTC markets are liquid and market makers are providing full support. It is hard to imagine vaults deleveraging or auction keepers recycling capital will go through that cycle efficiently fast.   lower volatility and less severe historical crashes for BTC vs ETH definitely helps with managing portfolio risk although correlation is still very high.   in terms of counterpary risk, BitGo and mentioned insurance policy carries high confidence among any other alternatives. Probably if WBTC becomes unbacked in case BitGo gets hacked, the whole crypto would anyway crash as hard as possible as many exchanges use it. There is though another layer of counterparty risk with merchant setup.   All in all I don\u2019t see a problem if Maker tests the WBTC vault usage with low debt ceiling and waits for improved liquidity metrics before it potentially increases it. I am still a bit sceptic about usage but I want to be surprised. Keep in mind though that if governance wants to use low SF for WBTC to attract DAI minting this wouldn\u2019t show us normal usage. Plus of course MKR would be carrying some risks as SF would normally need to compensate price volatility, liquidity risk and counterpary risk and we know both liquidity risk and counterparty risk of WBTC are much higher than that of ETH.

I\u2019ve been lurking on the forum a bit but this is my first post, please let me know if I violate any community norms or guidelines while I get accustomed. As the protocol designer of tBTC, I\u2019m against WBTC in MCD for the simple fact that it introduces a trusted synthetic as collateral when there\u2019s a robust permissionless BTC peg available in days. The MKR community has an opportunity to move the entire space forward by supporting a trustless peg as its first Bitcoin collateral rather than further splitting liquidity with centralized band-aids, and I believe it should use the opportunity to lead. I recognize that MCD needs security tokens and other \u201cfiat\u201d collateral to grow, but in this case there\u2019s a fully backed, permissionless, 1:1 redeemable alternative ready to use on mainnet in 12 days. Why introduce the risk when it\u2019s only buying 1000 BTC in liquidity and potential borrowers? We\u2019ll have a proposal for tBTC as collateral in MCD by the end of the week. Until then, I hope some of you will considering opposing this interim measure and putting all of our combined efforts behind a long-term solution. ",

But DAI also needs robust, diverse users- and I believe listing WBTC as collateral before a permissionless alternative is sending the wrong message about Maker\u2019s stance on decentralization and censorship-resistance, a message native Bitcoiners care about. The emergency USDC action sent a strong message\u2026 but it was an emergency. This isn\u2019t an emergency, and there are other forms of collateral that aren\u2019t glorified BTC scrip. Waiting for a robust permissionless option to get behind would be a strong move, rather than helping prop up a centralized coin. I\u2019d propose waiting for tBTC, renBTC, or a number of other prospective options over a fast-track listing of WBTC. At a bare minimum, if this is the only collateral that can solve the needs of the peg in the next 2 months, a lower debt ceiling of 3M DAI seems appropriate. ",

Those don\u2019t mean WBTC can\u2019t be a good collateral, it jus means the risk parameters need to reflect those risks. In particular the debt ceiling to limit the amount of exposure we have to WBTC. I\u2019m in favor of low stability fee (1-2%) as the overarching goal here is to generate as much Dai supply as possible to restore the peg. Once new synthetic Bitcoins come online like tBTC and renBTC I\u2019m in favor of adding those as well. With the caveat that I would like to see at least 3 months of incident-free operation to migitate smart-contract risk (them getting hacked). I\u2019m much less concerned about what message listing one before the other sends out. This isn\u2019t about choosing collateral that make us feel good, it\u2019s about managing risk to effectively regulate the peg, full stop.

I would say I only take a moderate view here, and understand we need to remain pragmatic. I am not against adding wbtc collateral in the short term. But, also we don\u2019t want to throw the baby out with the bath water. Bitcoin and Ethereum communities both have strong ideological beliefs around trustless, permissionless, noncustodial assets. We should have a mission toward maintaining those values as much as possible. It also improves risk, and will likely attract more people from bitcoin if we keep those ideas as core tenants. At some point without that, the question becomes: \u201cWhy use dai at all? It\u2019s just a collection of custodial tokens. Why not use usdc instead, which holds a peg better?\u201d.

It doesn\u2019t impact BTC depositors at all, only signers, and it will also be lessened in a future revision of the protocol- it was a conservative design choice for v1 to promote stability. ",
