But the 3 main questions were: -How do you overcommunicate successfully in a DAO? -How do you balance a revolving door of contibutors with liquid roles vs small focused teams with very dedicated roles? -What are the best practices around performance reviews in decentralized orgs?   Wouter (SES) - talk on Breaking the Dunbar\u2019s barrier at MakerDAO Since the dissolution of the Foundation, the Maker community has been working hard to scale up the DAO beyond the Dunbar number. This introduces significant coordination challenges. I want to talk about the difficulties we faced, what we\u2019ve learned throughout this journey, and offer these as takeaways for other projects following a decentralization compass.
