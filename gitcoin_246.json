The Gitcoin Stewards Council was created in March 2022 as a governance mechanism and has continued to refine the objectives, selection methods, and compensation of selected Gitcoin Steward Council members. The objective of this new council is to be an externally connected strategic body that will help Gitcoin improve market sensing ability and to provide feedback on strategy, proposals, and challenges. Also new to this cycle, Gitcoin, demonstrated a quadratically elected DAO Steward Council in a modified format of internal and external representatives. This new council will have one representative from each workstream and 10 externally active web3 leaders. The newly elected council will serve its new term until June 3rd, 2023.

Gitcoin has elected the next cohort of members to its Gitcoin Stewards Council.       ELECTIONS ARE NOW LIVE  (post updated 11.28.2022) As per the steward council v2 proposal, the vote for the next steward council is now live. For details on this process, please see the details below. As we are using a new quadratic voting strategy, we created a new snapshot site where you will need to join and vote. You can find the vote: Snapshot This vote will be conducted on Snapshot using \u201cegalitarian quadratic voting\u201d which means every registered steward will receive 99 tokens for which they can cast to any number of the 15 candidates using the Quadratic Voting methodology. Voting period will close at 12:00 pm UTC on Monday, December 05th. This is a whitelisted vote, which means this vote is open only to registered Gitcoin Stewards found here. FAQ: Q: What is quadratic voting and how do my votes count? A: See this quick explainer & simulator from The Economist Q: I thought we only vote for 5 days - why is this listed as seven? A: this vote will end over the weekend, which is not the full five \u201cwork\u201d days - so we extend it over the weekend to make sure everyone has plenty of time to vote. Q: Can I change my mind once voted if I see a certain candidate are (not) being upvoted? A: Yes, Votes can be changed while the proposal is active Q: Help - I get the error message \u201cOops, it seems you don\u2019t have any voting power at block blahblahblah\u201c - what does this mean? A: If you are a steward, this means the ETH wallet address you are attempting to vote from is not \u201cwhitelisted\u201d. The steward addresses \u201cwhitelisted\u201d were taken from the Introducing Steward Governance post. A: If you are no longer using the address you listed as a steward, please contact @shawn on Discord shawn16400#5507 and he can substitute one address with another. If you are not a steward but do want to vote because you hold GTC, this is unfortunately not possible at this time: you can delegate your voting power here to one of the existing stewards.  Gitcoin Steward Council: Nomination Thread and update TL:DR This post is the official announcement of nominees for the Gitcoin Steward Council election. This post also outlines the nominations process and announces the representatives from the individual workstreams. Specific voting instructions for the Stewards will be published shortly. The new Steward Council will have a term of 180 days (v3 term: ~ 05 December 2022 to ~03 June 2023). This post has four sections:  Background on the Stewards Council & election process How nominees were selected appointed workstream representatives Announcement of the nominees What happens next  As we are piloting a new quadratic voting methodology, this post does not include specific voting instructions. Those specific instructions will be distributed shortly to the voting stewards. To recall - this is our current voting schedule:  1387\u00d7401 39.9 KB  1.Background on the Steward Council: In May of 2021 Gitcoin launched GTC, the native governance token for Gitcoin. Along with the creation of GTC, the governance of Gitcoin was handed over to the community via a group of individuals known as Stewards. Stewards are trusted leaders with delegated (including self-delegated) voting power to make decisions on behalf of the community. To support a move towards more active and engaged governance participation, and recognizing governance took a significant amount of time, the Steward Council was created in March of 2022 and it consisted of the most active and engaged stewards as illustrated by the steward health cards found at https://www.daostewards.xyz At the conclusion of v1 of the council, in October 2022, a proposal was made to 1) Update objectives and role of the Steward Council 2. Allocate a monthly stipend to council members and 3) Change the selection process for how steward council members were chosen Documentation on those efforts can be found here:  Introducing the Steward Council The Steward Council - Formation & Mandate Proposal: V2 of the Steward Council  2.How nominees were selected & appointment of workstream representatives Following Proposal: V2 of the Steward Council, Gitcoin Workstreams identified 3 nominees per work stream and those nominees were reviewed by CSDO. Additionally, during this period, the work streams also identified the following representatives who will sit on the Steward Council their behalf. The appointed representatives are:  FDD: @DisruptionJoe  PGF: @ceresstation  GPC: @kevin.olsen  DAOops: @Krrisis  MMM: @Viriya  Gitcoin Foundation: @kyle   3.Announcement of the nominees: The following steward have been nominated by the Gitcoin Workstream leaders to stand in this upcoming election:     Nominee Nominated by Steward Post     Eugyal FDD Introducing Stewards Governance - #244 by eugyal   Ccerv1 FDD Introducing Stewards Governance - #254 by ccerv1   drnicka FDD Introducing Stewards Governance - #265 by drnicka   Annika PGF Introducing Stewards Governance - #194 by annika   Ken PGF Introducing Stewards Governance - #14 by ken   Dabit3 PGF Introducing Stewards Governance - #259 by dabit3   lthrift GPC Introducing Stewards Governance - #216 by lthrift   auryn GPC Introducing Stewards Governance - #22 by auryn   0x_sam GPC Introducing Stewards Governance - #266 by 0x_sam   Epowell101 DAOops Introducing Stewards Governance - #231 by epowell101   Griff DAOops Introducing Stewards Governance - #28 by griff   Pop DAOops Introducing Stewards Governance - #5 by Pop   J-pepper MMM Introducing Stewards Governance - #264 by j-pepper   llllvvuu MMM Introducing Stewards Governance - #255 by llllvvuu   ebransom MMM Introducing Stewards Governance - #268 by ebransom    Nominees are encouraged (but not required) to post a comment below with additional information about themselves and why they feel they would be a good addition to this Council.

And are nominated stewards the only ones that are allowed to be voted on for the council?   Yes, the proposal which was voted on stipulates the workstreams will nominate the council members. This is done so that each workstream will find the leading web3/DAO thought leaders with relevant experience to their particular workstream domain and recruit those web3 leaders to help build this Gitcoin council.   If done well - in time Gitcoin will have an exceptionally well connected council with broad experience across web3 from which to advise Gitcoin. To the second point, yes you are correct that the nominee list is limited to those nominated by workstreams, and who can vote is limited to the 178 stewards listed here:     \ud83e\udd16 DAO Governance and Vision     Discussions around the coordination, and the overall plans, goals, and vision of GitcoinDAO      To note, I do not presume that in this iteration everything will go swimmingly, or that we have defined the final solution.  We will send out a satisfaction survey and do a after action review to capture improvements for the next iteration in 6 months. ",

To keep it simple after some thinking I wanted to keep it down to 4. My votes were:   @griff 15%: Griff and I seem to agree on many things regarding crypto and Dao governance, especially on gitcoin. So I would really love to see him serve on the council.  @Pop 15%: Simona is amazing. Worked with her in gitcoin DAO in the past and with the previous counil iteration so it\u2019s a no-brainer to vote for her.  @auryn 35%: Auryn is a crypto OG. Remember him from the DAO days and really love seeing his work both in gnosis, but also in the quadratic funding field with clrfund. The higher % is since he is lower in the list and want to help him.  @drnicka 35%: I have seen Nick around in the forums, and also in crypto twitter and valued his perspective in various matters. So when I saw his nomination for the steward council I felt that he would be a great addition! The higher % is since he is lower in the list and want to help him.  ",
