You walk into a room of 10 experts, and they say 10 different things: it\u2019s a multisig wallet, it\u2019s anything with membership + ragequit, it\u2019s got to have a voting, it doesn\u2019t have to have voting, it\u2019s a complex socio-technical system, it\u2019s a PFP NFT, etc. Simultaneously, there\u2019s been a slow proliferation of stacks / DAO frameworks, with minimal collaboration, interop, or re-use of code / applications between those stacks. All this is creating issues for potential users and for the DAO ecosystem at large. E.g., from Syndicate:  \u201cIf we can just formalize what a DAO is, that would be incredibly helpful. We\u2019re not confident in building on some of these stacks, because we\u2019re not sure if they\u2019re going to be around in 10 years. We want persistent scripts for persistent organizations. And if your provider disappears, there should be some recourse for you.\u201d  Or, from Compound:  \"The important thing is to build a better ecosystem for DAO developers. How do you bring in the next 1000 devs? To do that, we need a shared set of tools.\u201d  To address these problems, Metagov has been running a standards roundtable called DAOstar One featuring many organizations in the DAO space (including every major DAO framework), and we\u2019re speccing out a new ERC standard for DAOs\u2014featuring a \u201cminimal DAO\u201d + standard contract interfaces\u2014that we plan to develop and ship over the next 4 months. You can read more details in the DAOstar one-pager. Our process is just getting started. For now, I wanted to reach out to the experts in this community to invite your participation (let me know if you\u2019d like to hop in as an invited expert) and to solicit comments. What would you like to see (or not see) in a DAO standard? Do you think something like this is necessary; why or why not? How would you tackle the problem of supporting the existing DAO use-cases without restricting further innovation? As our process develops, I\u2019ll also be posting updates in this thread. Folks like @lrettig have told me about how valuable a resource this community is. I would love to work with y\u2019all to figure out the approach for this standard and for DAOs in general. And if you managed to get to the end of this long post, please get in touch  look forward to buidling together! <3, Josh ",

Short summary: A standard URI and JSON schema for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), focusing on relating on-chain and off-chain representations of membership and proposals. Why we need it now: The working paper has a longer rationale that you can read, but based on the past four months of roundtable conversations with frameworks, tooling developers, and DAOs, there is strong consensus across the ecosystem that a daoURI + JSON schema, similar to tokenURI, is immediately useful and a great first step toward other DAO standards. For those of you at ETH Denver next week, we will be presenting the draft at Schelling Point & ETH Denver. We\u2019ll also be setting up a series of community calls to invite comment + discussion, and will post more details the week after next. Cheers, Josh, Isaac, Ido, Zargham, Eyal, Sam, and many others on the DAOstar team ",
