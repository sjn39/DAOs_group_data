But to be explicit: these thoughts and comments represent my personal position, rather than GovAlpha\u2019s.   LFWs Endgame Commentary  Aims  Highlight perceived risks with the Endgame plan that may have gone under-examined. Encourage changes in how the Endgame plan is realised to avoid the situation where Maker is locked into doing or continuing to do something that is not working. Suggest simplifications to the proposed Endgame structure.   Initial Comments Fair warning, this piece may be difficult to engage with if you\u2019re not familiar with Rune\u2019s Endgame V3 post. I want to start out by communicating explicitly that I believe parts of Endgame are positive ideas and useful tools for structuring MakerDAO in the future. I don\u2019t want to spend too many words on these, but I want to list them here, both as a positive start and to bring clarity to the rest. After talking about the positives, I\u2019ll move on to my perceived risk areas. There are a number of these, and I\u2019ll do my best to respect your time and cover them as concisely as I can. These include  MetaDAO community MetaDAO value Organizational Complexity Politics Profit-seeking, Competition and Expense The importance of a line of retreat The importance of buy-in  Then, we\u2019ll move on to potential mitigations and changes that could be adopted to change how Endgame is implemented. Finally, I\u2019ll highlight some simplifications that I believe would be net-beneficial to the Endgame plan, at least during the transition period as Maker moves from where we are now, to the Endgame structure. As one final note, I\u2019m aware that Endgame has not been voted on at this time, and may not be implemented in any form. That said, there appears to be enough inertia behind it that it stands a fair chance of passing. More importantly, it\u2019s annoying to phrase everything as \u2018the proposed endgame plan\u2019 and suchlike, so I\u2019ve written this without paying attention to future-conditional phrasing.  Positives Accumulating ETH - Good idea, should have started doing it as soon as we realised we needed RWA to meet DAI demand. Backing DAI with protocol-owned ETH - Dangerous idea, but valuable if done in moderation. EtherDAI - Generally seems like a positive, the main downsides being the effort required for the full implementation. Obviously ties into the above. Elixir - We\u2019ve needed a good liquidity solution for a while. ETH-DAI-MKR is a logical focus for the efforts. Using EtherDai rather than pure ETH is also sensible. Unbiased Currency Stances - These are a useful tool for articulating and discussing the issue of RWAs backing DAI. I\u2019m not dogmatically in favour of any stance, but having the options more explicitly explained and laid out is a huge benefit. Self-selecting working groups - This seems like an obvious win, people work better when they are working with people they respect and this should result in less internal drama within groups. Generalized working groups - This is in comparison to specialised core units that focus on a single area. Generalized groups can organize better around higher-level outcomes and provide more redundancy than specialization does. It feels useful to support both types of group. Scopes at an organizational level - Good idea for what I hope are obvious reasons. By having clear agreement on what our scopes for work are, we can make reasoned decisions on the objectives we are trying to meet, and what work to fund. Standardised Coordination Tools - These are required to minimize governance burden at scale. Always have been. The downside is redundancy, but that can generally be addressed via multiple mirrors and decentralized data-sources.  Endgame Risks  MetaDAO community The first risk I want to highlight is the risk that MetaDAOs cannot create/attract/retain meaningful communities. I have three concerns related to this.  Not everyone wants to create/manage a community  This point relates more to those individuals and groups involved in clustering (both in a general and a specific sense) rather than to the potential members of any community themselves. I hypothesise that in general the ability and desire to attract, create, organise and operate a community is rarer than most assume. Further, that individuals that do have both the desire and ability are likely to self-select themselves into roles where they can express that ability and desire naturally. This seems somewhat counter to the process of clustering that is currently taking place. In general it seems that we are finding and grouping existing actors within MakerDAO and giving them this task, rather than finding individuals that are naturally suited to it. In the long-term, this may be less of a problem as future MetaDAO incubation will take place in a more open setting.  Self-determination seems to have been a key rallying point in existing DAO Communities, and MetaDAOs cannot meaningfully self-determine.  Under the MetaDAO paradigm, MakerCore retains control of a MetaDAOs treasury, imposes rules, and adjudicates disagreements among the MetaDAOs. This has not been present in many DAOs that have bootstrapped successful communities, and has been present in some high-profile failures to bootstrap successful communities. At the very least, communities generally seem to demand a promise of future sovereignty. Without the commitment to decentralisation from the Maker Foundation, I doubt as many individuals would have been attracted to the project. Anecdotally, I would not have been.  Given examples of successful Meta-Engineering don\u2019t actually have very successful or high-quality communities.  A number of examples were provided in the Endgame V3 post. Namely:  Uniswap Unit Bias Memecoins Early Bitcoin  While Uniswap has retained popularity among users, I think most would agree that the DAO-side has been somewhat lacklustre. The forum tends to attract attention to controversial proposals, but is otherwise low-activity. Initiative among community members appears to be low. Unit-bias Memecoins such as Dogecoin, etc, do create brief and short-lived communities. However, such communities are heavily speculation based, and tend to start to dissolve when price movement turns negative. While there are examples of community members taking initiative and taking action in the community, these are short-lived and ad-hoc. The Early Bitcoin community did start the whole cryptocurrency industry, Ethereum, Defi, etc. However, many of the communities that this spawned separated from Bitcoin as the core community became more and more ideologically fixed. So while communities were created, in most cases they separated from and in some cases disavowed the bitcoin community.  MetaDAO value Next I\u2019ll address MetaDAO value, and the risk that we\u2019re vastly overestimating the value of MDAO tokens and that structures built under the assumption of value will not operate as advertised. Again, my concerns are divided into three main areas.  Tokenomics  Large initial emissions plus permanent future emissions of MDAO tokens are only really balanced by MetaElixir purchases using minted MKR. While captive liquidity in constant product pools does create artificial demand, it does not create value in itself. At best this is a transfer of value from the MKR token to the MDAO token. In practice though, given the large MDAO emissions, a significant amount of MKR will also need to be emitted to give the MDAO tokens any level of price stability. In theory, the accumulation of (regular) Elixir should give MDAO tokens some value, however, given that the Elixir is being accrued by directly selling MDAO tokens, this will also be of limited effect. Further, while the Elixir is on paper owned by the MetaDAO, in practice MakerCore has power over a MetaDAOs treasury, and there is no redemption plan or similar that allows MetaDAO assets to be divested to MDAO token holders. This might be more tidily summed up by the question: \u201cWould you be willing to get paid for your work only in vested MDAO tokens?\u201d I\u2019d argue that a large share of individuals wouldn\u2019t work solely for vested _MKR _tokens, let alone _MDAO _tokens.  Limited Revenues  While there are numerous described revenue sources for MetaDAOs in the V3 Endgame plan, I am unconvinced that these will allow for meaningful revenues.  Adopted decentralised vaults will likely be small, and stability fees are still low and seem likely to remain so. Outsourcing MetaDAO-resident teams will only provide limited value, the teams aren\u2019t large, and the MetaDAO cut of the revenue is likely to be small given that the teams could operate outside of the MetaDAO just as easily. Node operation was slated as a future thing, but even then, this revenue is likely to come directly from Maker, and not an external source. Representing a transfer of value, and not new value.  Further, all of these revenues will be going to the MetaDAO treasury and not the MDAO token. In an entrepreneurial environment, the MetaDAO administration teams are unlikely to want to surrender this, and instead use it to grow the MetaDAO. In a traditional organisation this would likely lead to growth in stock price, but I don\u2019t believe this outcome has been observed consistently in DeFi with tokens. Finally, the MetaDAO administration teams themselves will need to be paid, which will further cut into value that might otherwise be assigned to the MDAO token. Adopted + new RWA vaults could provide significant revenues, but only to ProtectorDAOs, which brings me neatly to the third concern.  MetaDAO classes are not equal in value  Even if the market ascribes MDAO tokens some speculative value, it will be ascribed unequally between Creator, Protector and Governor DAOs. GovernorDAOs specifically will be worse off, as they will not be able to leverage the revenue-share models that Creators have to the same extent, and do not have the option of RWA vault adoption that Protectors have. GovernorDAOs are arguably the key to ensuring the continued stable operation of MakerCore, and the future implementation of the Endgame plan. While they are paid by MakerCore for guaranteeing scoped results, this revenue is both:  Not sourced external to Maker. Will mostly go to cover workforce expenses or expand the GovernorDAO.  Given that there are likely only a limited number of people that wish to retain possession of some form of Maker MetaDAO token, MetaDAOs will be in competition. Competition between MetaDAOs of different classes could cause significant problems.  Organizational Complexity A couple of related risks here! The risk that the complexity of Endgame impedes community adoption of MetaDAOs and the risk that the new organizational structure of the decentralized workforce is separated into too many levels for effective work. I don\u2019t think that anyone disagrees that Maker post-endgame will be more complex than it is now. While you might argue that the complexity exists currently, but is hidden, there will undoubtedly be new hidden complexity in an Endgame structure as well, in addition to the wider organisation of MakerCore and MetaDAOs being more complex by virtue of sheer scale. We already field users (new and old) that claim that Maker as it is today is too complex for them to get into. This will naturally get worse, especially during the transition to Endgame at a time where we\u2019re specifically relying on the creation of communities for each MetaDAO. Potentially more problematic, there are too many management/decision-making levels in the proposed organisational structure of Endgame. See:  MakerCore Governance MakerCore Delegates + DVCs MetaDAO Governance of GovernorDAOs GovernorDAO administration teams GovernorDAO contribution teams MakerCore Budget Allocators (optional) Governance Councils + Tribunals Core Units MetaDAO Governance of CreatorDAOs CreatorDAO administration teams CreatorDAO contribution teams Ecosystem Actors  Now, the above is perhaps the worst-case, least-charitable interpretation of the Endgame Plan V3 document. But even if you disregard a full half of these, you are left with 6 levels of organisation to go from the principal to the agent that actually performs the work. You can give me all the reasons in the world for this, and it will still seem insane to me. This will exacerbate the issue of community-building as described above, and has negative implications with respect to transparency as well, despite the Universal DAO coordination tool proposed in Endgame V3.  Politics Moving on to a commonly repeated point in Endgame V3: the removal of politics and drama. In fact,  I believe there is the risk that MetaDAOs will not reduce the drama and politics, and may even increase it. A key value proposition of the Endgame plan is that it will end or greatly reduce drama and political issues by forcing communications to happen DAO2DAO. This position feels very naive to me. DAOs are made up of people and inevitably people will have relationships across MetaDAOs, between levels of the decentralized hierarchy, etc. This will be doubly true in the initial stages, as we have individuals in MetaDAOs and existing Core Units wearing multiple hats. Further, even if we accept that we can enforce DAO2DAO interactions across MakerCore and the MetaDAOs, there are countless examples in the DeFi space of just these sort of DAO2DAO interactions causing significant drama between the communities and individuals involved - often focused on the motivation of the authors of said proposal. I suppose my conclusion is that DAOs (as with any organisation) are made up of humans, and humans will politic, especially when they feel that they are in danger. The separation of the humans into separate DAOs will not make them less human, or prevent them from interacting. One can argue that MakerCore can enforce standards of behavior on MetaDAOs, but it cannot enforce standards of behavior that directly conflict with human nature. The result of attempted enforcement will be driving such behavior underground, rather than preventing it.  Profit-seeking, Competition and Expense Following from politics, and the above discussions of value and organizational complexity, I\u2019ll now speak about the potential expense of the plan, and the risk that MetaDAOs will not deliver effective work for the cost. Traditionally, having multiple profit-seeking agents compete and various levels of a business or economy is generally held as beneficial: the competitive pressure leading to improved efficiency and effectiveness. In practice, every level of profit-seeking agent drains value from the principal. While in healthy markets (which are by no means guaranteed) competition prevents excessive profit seeking at each individual level, the combined profit-seeking of multiple levels in concert will still drain significant value. As a further negative, competitive pressures often lead to negative externalities in a drive to reduce costs. MakerCore is essentially taking the position of a regulator of MetaDAOs. This function is doable, but is also expensive and easily corrupted. Separation of concerns is also likely to lead to lower quality work. If MetaDAO contributors care about the MetaDAO over MakerCore, work will suffer. The larger the separation between the agent and the principal, the less the delivered work will match the brief under which it was commissioned, and may be of lower quality. More specifically, MetaDAOs are going to be very very expensive for MakerCore. Large amounts of MKR must be printed to attempt to support MDAO token value, and I believe large salaries in DAI are required for the initial MetaDAO teams to encourage the transition. Crucially, if the members of the initial MetaDAOs truly believed in the effectiveness and success of the Endgame structure, they would not demand additional salaries in DAI from MakerCore. This is not to imply any maliciousness on those individuals\u2019 parts, they are taking extremely rational positions. However, their taking that position is evidence that they are less than fully convinced that their expected-value is positive without those salaries. In practice this means that MKR Holders are taking that risk for them. This is also extremely important with respect to the initial MetaDAOs versus any subsequent MetaDAOs. If the initial MetaDAOs are successful, that does not give us firm evidence that the structure will work without this initial support in DAI from MakerCore. This salary in DAI also negatively affects the incentive alignment between the initial MetaDAO teams and Maker, as Rune has been fond of noting about the existing Core Unit structure. In fact the bet is extremely asymmetrically in favour of these individuals, and against Maker. They have limited risk for the duration of the salaries paid in DAI, but very high upside if the structure is successful and MDAO tokens accrue significant value.  The importance of a line of retreat Put bluntly, the risk that the lack of a line of retreat from Endgame will lead to the collapse of MakerDAO In its current version, there is no defined way to test aspects of the Endgame plan prior to commitment, nor is there a defined path to reverse that commitment without the chaos that would come from an unplanned wind-down of MetaDAOs and a reversion to existing structures. This in itself feels like an unacceptable risk given the inherent uncertainty in a plan as complex as Endgame. Further, the lack of a \u2018way back\u2019 has the effect of polarizing the adoption of Endgame needlessly. It excludes those individuals currently at a \u2018middle ground\u2019 position with respect to the status-quo. Such individuals may be willing to support endgame as a direction, but may be unwilling to go \u2018all in\u2019 as the plan currently demands. Additionally, the holders of MKR are mutable over time, both in membership and views. A decision made today cannot (by design of the Maker Protocol) commit MKR holders to a course of action in the future. The attempt to do so via \u2018soft\u2019 constraints increases the risk of a more violent and destructive departure from the direction in the future. The accumulation and centralization of anything less than a majority of circulating MKR does not mitigate this risk. Given that a key part of the Endgame plan is to decentralise and distribute new MKR token to new users, this risk feels even more likely to be borne out.  The importance of buy-in Or the risk that Endgame fails due to lack of buy-in amongst the decentralized workforce. Endgame represents a massive change from the status quo that will require the enthusiastic support of the entire decentralized workforce to maximize its chance of successful implementation. The success of Endgame is not something that MKR token holders can mandate into existence, the chances would be vastly improved by earning _everyone\u2019s _support. Individuals that are not convinced will likely fall into three categories, if they end up working under the endgame structure. Either:  They will leave and seek work elsewhere. They will work-to-rule. They will adjust and become enthusiastic supporters of the new structure.  Which a given individual choses naturally depends on their situation, principles and general nature. However, two of these outcomes are really bad for Maker, in both cases losing the active productive energy of individuals that have a great deal of knowledge about how Maker works, and have been skilled enough to retain their positions thus far. There\u2019s no maliciousness in this either (pre-empting accusations of evils of the labour movement and unionisation, etc), it\u2019s just natural human behaviour. If someone believes in something, they will work harder to make it a success. If they don\u2019t believe in something, they will find something else to do, or extract a paycheck without caring overmuch about the principal\u2019s success. Maker can hope to attract new workers that believe in the principles of Endgame, but this takes time, and in the meantime you are left with a partially depleted workforce that is not fully-invested in the success of the plan.  Proposed Changes to the Endgame Implementation Process These next two sections bring us to the more constructive portion of this post. I have not spent a huge amount of time thinking about these options, instead they represent the obvious \u2018but what if we\u2026\u2019s that jump to mind when considering Endgame.  Atomic Changes Perhaps the single most important change I\u2019d recommend to the implementation of Endgame applies more to the process of implementation than the contents itself. Namely, that each piece of the Endgame plan is implemented (or not) individually and according to its own merits. The problem of bundling multiple changes into one vote has been known to us for some time. It can lead to items in bundles passing that would not have passed otherwise, and this can cause further contention and disagreement. We failed to atomically implement changes back when first introducing MIPs, and that has resulted in a number of MIPs in the first two MIP sets being approved, but largely ignored. I argue that if Endgame MIPs are bundled in the same way, we will end up in the same situation, with the less-known or less-commonly used MIPs ignored, forgotten or selectively enforced. The benefits of atomic changes are threefold:  It encourages voters to read individual MIPs carefully, rather than voting for the \u2018general theme\u2019 of a MIP set. It will highlight which parts of the Endgame plan have widespread support, and which require more consensus-building. It leads to more investment in the structures and processes that have been approved.  To be clear, I\u2019m not advocating for no MIP sets at all, but in my view, they should only be used when each of the contents is actually dependent on the rest. This is not true for much of the Endgame plan contents, including the initial launch MIP set.  Reinstate Exploratory and Fallback Options Reinstating fallback options that were present in some of the initial Endgame drafts may be a good idea, given the risks I\u2019ve highlighted above. In my eyes, the key benefits here would be:  Preventing a destructive change in direction if the views / ownership of the MKR token changes in the future. Increasing support for Endgame among middle-ground governance participants.  In practice, this might include the following:  Bringing back the idea of trialling the MetaDAO framework with a single initial MetaDAO. Defining a predetermined wind-down plan for MetaDAOs, and re-integration of those working under them into Maker Core, where desirable. Defining wind-down for the more technical aspects of Endgame, such as the protocol owned vault, MKR emissions, Elixir, ETHD, etc.  On a personal note, the lack of a credible fallback option to me implies weakness in the plan rather than strength. While there does need to be some level of commitment to a direction, the strength of the direction itself should be enough to encourage commitment without requiring a vote to \u2018lock-in\u2019 the plan taking place at a single point in time.  Steelman Behaviour I believe the published Endgame material lacks, as a whole, a clear description of the trade-offs and the negative implications of the adoption of Endgame. In my mind, the lack of these implies some combination of some five things:  The author has not considered the negative implications. The author has not been able to find any negative implications because none exist. The author has not been able to find any negative implications because they lack the capacity. The author does not want to reveal the negative implications for fear that they will sabotage the chances of the plan\u2019s adoption. The author has not prioritised describing the negative implications given limited resources.  While I will grant that well reasoned consideration of the negative implications and trade-offs can come from anyone with sufficient knowledge of the plan, this plan in particular is very complex, is adjusted frequently, and is very large. This naturally puts the author in the best position to steelman Endgame. For those unaware, a steel man argument is the opposite of a straw-man argument. The idea is to help ones opponents construct the strongest form of their argument. I would like to see Rune (and anyone else willing) to attempt to steelman the arguments against Endgame. Thus far I have seen no written evidence of this, and I consider it a requirement before an informed decision can be made on something as complex and wide-reaching as the Endgame plan.  Possible Simplifications to Endgame Note, some or all of these could be adopted in concert, they are not meant to be mutually exclusive.  Drop Governor MetaDAOs Of the three classes of MetaDAOs, GovernorDAOs appear to have the following qualities:  They have the least scope for generating revenue, making them the least competitive. They manage processes at MakerCore that cannot be allowed to fail (spell contents, process adherence, MetaDAO refereeing) They may be the least \u2018exciting\u2019 to most people. They may tend to not attract individuals with entrepreneurial mindsets.  In general, my view is that they are the MetaDAO class with the least chance of being successful in the long term. With this in mind, it may be beneficial to remove Governor MetaDAOs and transfer their functionality to MakerCore. I do not believe this would have a significant impact on scaling, or meaningfully limit the upsides of MetaDAOs.Creator and Protector MetaDAOs cover the areas in which I believe we have seen most drama and disagreement about direction. A system in which MakerCore directly oversees Creators and Protectors and is in turn overseen by delegates and DVCs seems to be a very workable structure. Further, removing Governor MetaDAOs and keeping their functionality in MakerCore would serve to slightly reduce the number of organizational layers, which may also be of benefit in terms of efficiency. A fork of this suggestion is also to do the above, but specifically label it as a temporary state of affairs. Creator and Protector MetaDAOs could be created in the first wave, and oversight maintained directly by MakerCore. If MetaDAOs as a concept are wildly successful, the oversight and management parts could be moved to Governor MetaDAOs at a later date.  MetaDAOs \u2192 MetaUnits The crux of this suggestion is that maybe MetaDAOs don\u2019t actually need to be DAOs. I see many of the same benefits that would apply regardless if the MetaThing was a MetaDAO or a MetaUnit. A hypothetical MetaUnit would have the following characteristics:  Same revenue-share options as MetaDAOs. Clustering happens in much the same way, the key being that groups can self-select in order to minimise conflict and drama. Same rules and requirements as required of MetaDAOs. Frontends, transparency, size-limits, etc, etc. Crucially, no need to develop their own community and no need to have a separate token and manage external governance. MetaUnits would have MKR vesting instead, and the MDAO farming would just be MKR farming. Given the desire to keep interactions DAO2DAO, a simple internal voting system could be mandated for MetaUnit teams, alternatively, something on-chain and more-complex like a MolochDAO. MetaUnits could still rely on MakerCore governance to manage treasuries, etc. and MakerCore could simply implement the results of the MetaUnit internal voting system.  Many of the benefits that would only apply to MetaDAOs are some of those I consider the riskiest and most variable. Namely, the meta-value accrued by the DAO.  Reduce Organization / Management Layers In the Endgame plan as it stands, there are a large number of management layers between the principals and the agents doing the work. We should find a way to reduce the number of agent layers. It\u2019s hard to say exactly how to reduce these without impacting other Endgame goals. The two suggestions above would both have the effect of reducing the number of layers involved in decision-making. Absent of those suggestions, perhaps one or more of the following:  Simplify the internal MetaDAO structure into a single team. Simplify the MakerCore governance layers back to delegates + token holders, or alternatively, to DVCs + token holders. Combine the roles of budget allocator and scope councils/tribunals.   Conclusion I admit I don\u2019t really have much of a conclusion. I will note (uncharitably) that the existing Endgame plan reasoning and support feels very-much like an example of the politicians syllogism, a logical fallacy of the following form:  Something must be done. This is something, therefore we must do it.  I believe this is spurred by a combination of two factors.  First, by the low morale, unhealthy debate and unrelenting criticism that has become a part of the discourse at Maker. Second, by the influence naturally retained by Rune as the founder of MakerDAO, which is suppressing generation and serious discussion of alternatives.  Given the points raised in this document, I believe the vote to commit to the Endgame plan is premature. Instead, I would encourage the governance community at MakerDAO to lobby for an atomic approach, taking the best parts of the Endgame plan and mitigating or discarding the riskier parts. Thanks for reading. My apologies for the length. ",

                    "content": "Thank you LFW for sharing this rigorous and thoughtful commentary. It\u2019s important because of your prominence in summarizing the plan and providing educational resources - and brave as well, which I especially appreciate. I felt the work on behalf of GovAlpha gave the impression of your personal endorsement and contributed to the \u201cinertia\u201d toward (potential) inevitability. The evolution of the \u201cEndgame\u201d discussion and current MIP set submission reflect a destructive abuse of power by the author due to his unique ability to command DAO CU attention and community resources in a way that other ideas and contributors could not. Our Recognized Delegate position is fully aligned with all - every single one - of the Endgame Risks you describe, and many of the proposed changes. In particular, I wanted to comment on your reflections about building DAO communities. You are right, it is wicked HARD!     LongForWisdom:  I hypothesise that in general the ability and desire to attract, create, organise and operate a community is rarer than most assume. Further, that individuals that do have both the desire and ability are likely to self-select themselves into roles where they can express that ability and desire naturally.   I\u2019m often putting forward my legal credentials as a cornerstone of the experience, skillsets and perspective ACREinvest brings our work as a Delegate. However, I am also a Founder of a \u201ctokenized community\u201d and have been building in that role for over 18 months to create a network of 1000 DAOs that cooperate to see DeFi used for positive real world impact (Regenerative Finance or ReFi). My lived experience around metaDAO concepts could be just as important to bring to bear as the tradfi legal background. ACREinvest would very much love to lean in more as we offered early on in the first days of June when Endgame concepts emerged from Discord to the Forum. That was before the LOVE vote after which things around here really devolved with respect to inclusivity, transparency and decentralization. For those who think I\u2019ve always been opposed to the plan while refusing to attend any of the related meetings or calls, this is not the case.      The Endgame Plan parts 1&2 Governance       Thank you! It is super helpful to have as condensed a summary as possible to begin with in trying to digest and evaluate the Plan. I also appreciate having recordings of relevant meetings available, so those of us who could not attend can stay in the loop.  Thank you @Davidutro for posting Open Decentralized Voter Committee | June 01, 2022 - YouTube in the comments at Decentralized Voter Committees: startup phase - Wednesdays 5pm CEST. All MKR holders welcome - #29 by Davidutro  BULLISH ON METAD\u2026        The Endgame Plan parts 1&2   BULLISH ON METADAOs I\u2019m extremely bullish on the MetaDAO/subDAO/pod architectural approach for scaling capacity and overcoming operational complexity in DAOs. In the case of MakerDAO, I lean toward an approach that might be better termed \u201csatellite\u201d DAOs. Consider: A satelliteDAO is not within any hierarchy or control mechanism established by the main DAO. Instead, it hovers above the gravitational forces applying constant pressure to the main DAO and is a constant source of valuable, always functioning, real-time information. MakerDAO can to some extent open-source governance by incentivizing decentralized groups to form who would design their own tokenomics and manage their own human capital resource needs in order to feed expertise, knowledge and information INTO MakerDAO governance. My hunch is that a successful incentive mechanism in this model would require a tiny fraction of the costs and time as any plan that would be internal to the current CU and Delegate operating structure. ENCOURAGING A COMPETITIVE FREE MARKET FOR GOVERNANCE INFORMATION MakerDAO can maintain the current newly decentralized operating framework and push complexity and cost OUT of the organization by encouraging a competitive market for governance services to form, thereby supplying MKR holders with an ever dynamic choice for who can best distill and communicate information needed to increase engagement by MKR holders overall and assist Delegates in voting effectively. NOTE: This approach in no way shares or delegates direct MKR voting POWER with or to a satellite DAO.   For those interested in what\u2019s been informing our thinking around folding ACREinvest\u2019s own operations into a metaDAO like structure, here are resources we\u2019ve been actively engaging for several months:    mirror.xyz   A Playbook for Using Impact DAOs to Change the World Anyone interested in exploring new ways to organize DAOs will find my latest whitepaper, A Playbook for Using Impact DAOs to Change the World, intriguing.         mirror.xyz   A Useful Way of Thinking for Governing a DAO: 0. Overview The series:         metropolis.mirror.xyz    Digital Cities The next generation of cities won\u2019t be built with wood or bricks or steel. This time around, cities will be built with code.         forefront.mirror.xyz    Tokenized Communities Web3 has introduced a new type of organization: Tokenized Communities.      All of the above is meant to simply say, we join any social consensus that may be forming to stop the implementation of the Endgame plan as currently underway via the relevant MIP set. We welcome a truly open, constructive and inclusive opportunity to engage lots of ideas and voices. These voices should not only be the current set of insiders! What we have here by @divine_economy with support from Recognized Delegates @twblack88 @rspa is PHENOMENAL by way of example!    Using jokedao for soft consensus in governance Proposal Ideas       jokedao: the quick story  jokedao is building community-led governance experiments for DAOs to build soft consensus. We launched last month and are already being used by Tally, Aave, Packy Mccormick (Not Boring), Austin Griffith (BuidlGuidl), Juicebox, and many more.  Got 5 minutes? Here is an explainer tweet: https://twitter.com/jokedao_/status/1549053081266008065  What is Jokedao?  http://www.jokedao.io  jokedao enables bottom-up, on-chain governance, letting token-holders submit proposals and\u2026     The status quo that has been achieved since the dissolution of the Foundation is impressive and successful by many estimates. I believe we\u2019ve got the Mott\u2019s to pull together, steady the ship, supercharge morale and address our challenges in a way that leverages our strengths, rather than open significant new risks for our demise.

                    "content": "Finally I have some time to start replying to posts and this is of course the most important place to start! First I want to thank LFW for the huge amount of work he has done making simplified descriptions of the Endgame Plan and thinking critically about many intricate details and core principles. It has undoubtedly been very helpful in allowing others to grasp some of these concepts, as well as helpful for making improvements to the plan itself. Now let me get into answering each of the points raised here, I will attempt to make it as short and readable as possible but in some cases I will likely have to dig more deeply into the concepts to provide a good answer.   Not everyone wants to create/manage a community   Totally agree with this statement. MetaDAOs are of course only for those who actually want this, in fact high level work in a DAO should only be for people of this sort, as working in a DAO fundamentally is about nurturing a community. Luckily we do have many people who specifically want work in a DAO and believe that DAOs and crypto is interesting in its own right, not just a source of easy budgets, high pay and no accountability. The MetaDAOs is how we can empower these people and let them prove their own worth in the marketplace, instead of forcing them to play politics with those who mainly are here to politick their way to control of resources.   Self-determination seems to have been a key rallying point in existing DAO Communities, and MetaDAOs cannot meaningfully self-determine.   I disagree - as long as Maker maintains the Endgame equilibrium and faithfully interprets all MIPs etc, then MetaDAOs have full freedom to everything that isn\u2019t directly harmful such as ponzis or fraud. From a user acquisition perspective, if you dont have any reputation yourself, it is useful for a MetaDAO to be able to prove that it is prohibited from doing very harmful and user hostile activity, leveraging the reputation of Maker. Another aspect of this to note is that this also means that MetaDAOs can bind each other, meaning they can make meaningful agreements that they know will be enforced by Maker - that opens up a major dimension of new opportunities for decentralized economic activity. The best way to think about this is the classic reality about free markets - even a free market must be regulated to remain free, or it devolves into either a monopolist or scams. Maker plays the role of a locked down, reliable, decentralized self-regulatory mechanism for the MetaDAOs.   Given examples of successful Meta-Engineering don\u2019t actually have very successful or high-quality communities.   This is all true but this argument is also like saying that since NuBits and BitAssets failed, then Dai is also going to fail because its proven that decentralized stablecoins dont work. Imagine if the above projects were armed with a functional and secure DeFi business model such as a stablecoin or a lending platform - it\u2019s easy to imagine that some of these communities could find a way to convert their strong meta, growth and userbase into a sustainable business model.   MetaDAO Tokenomics   The best way to think about MetaDAO tokenomics is to compare the relative emissions of MKR and MetaDAO tokens. Initially, Maker will emit about 6% of its total supply per year, while the MetaDAOs will emit 3% of their total supply per year. This means that the tokenomics heavily favor the MetaDAOs, and it will remain in their favor until 17 years have passed, at which point the relative emissions of MKR will be about 3% as well. There are a lot of additional dynamics that determine where they end up equilibrating, but ultimately even though at some point in the very long run the tokenomics will benefit Maker more than the MetaDAOs, at that point if Maker has been successful in scaling to a global size the MetaDAOs will still benefit just from having a proportional exposure to such a massive absolute size.   Limited Revenues   The MetaDAOs obviously don\u2019t have as much revenue potential as something like Maker, but proportionally they can have even lower recurring expenses. A MetaDAO can be successful run and scale its userbase with as little as just 3-5 people on its team, and then onboard hundreds of millions of economic activity to Maker, that it can then earn a 25% revenue share on, and on top of that upsell its userbase with additional premium features. It won\u2019t even have to develop those premium features itself, but can simply acquire through a \u201cplug and play\u201d revenue share solution thats available out of the box - something that is only possible because of the role Maker plays as the highest governance authority. Add this to the beneficial tokenomics that favors the MetaDAO 2x vs Maker during the initial years, and it is a very attractive opportunity for people with the right interests and risk tolerance to be able to be a part of the initial lean team to bootstrap and scale a MetaDAO.   MetaDAO classes are not equal in value   I don\u2019t see why they need to be equal in value - the classes are just important to ensure that certain critical roles that the MetaDAOs play in relation to Maker don\u2019t overlap and cause conflict of interest or risk obscurity issues  The risk that the complexity of Endgame impedes community adoption of MetaDAOs and the risk that the new organizational structure of the decentralized workforce is separated into too many levels for effective work.  A DAO is like a blockchain - it will never be more effective than just doing something centralized, and as a result it should only be used specifically to do things that can only be done with a DAO. We should not be trying to model Maker on a futuristic company that is more efficient than a modern company, because that\u2019s impossible. Instead we should aim to optimize Maker to securely run a decentralized stablecoin and DeFi protocols without getting captured or corrupted. There is a lot of explicit complexity that is directly designed in the Endgame Plan, but that is required because of the incredible scope and challenge of trying to run a fully decentralized and self sustainable stablecoin and economy which necessitates regulating highly complicated interactions between humans that consider their own interests. The current status quo seems simple because it simply hides away all of the impossibly complex challenges. E.g. how does the status quo handle the situation where you have two Core Units that on the surface seem like they have very adjacent responsibilities and as a result should be collaborating closely, but in practice have a broken meta between them and are constantly fighting and creating drama, politicking for resources and struggling for control, while also leaving gaps of work that seems boring to the other group. The Endgame is designed to specifically handle such a situation, and the infinite amounts of other similar situations that can occur, and in fact are constantly occuring, in the decentralized workforce today. We have to completely rethink how to structure organizations once we realize how badly suited a traditional relationship-based structure of organizing work is for a DAO where there is no fiduciary duty and no boss that has final accountability. Instead of using top down budgets and mission statements, we must construct incentives and open rewards and then let the economy organize itself to take advantage of those opportunities.  MetaDAOs will not reduce the drama and politics, and may even increase it.  The key advantage of MetaDAOs is that they enable much smaller decentralized workforces to collaborate indirectly in an economy, rather than trying to get a giant team of 130 people to function in harmony. This is by itself a huge advantage, really the biggest of all. It is common knowledge nowadays that DAOs work when they are small, and fall apart and descend into dysfunctional politics once they get large enough that people dont know each other personally anymore. There will still be drama in some MetaDAOs even when they are very small, but that will just cause them to die off - since they will have isolated forums, discords, and work relationships, this will not be contagious to the same extent as we have seen in Maker. Additionally the evolutionary pressure of having dysfunctional MetaDAOs die off while the MetaDAOs that develop a good and stable Meta will thrive is going to make it a lot easier for newer MetaDAOs to learn the right lessons and copy the best approaches.  risk that MetaDAOs will not deliver effective work for the cost.  Again as I mentioned above a MetaDAO should never try to do the work of a company. In practice MetaDAOs will likely outsource a lot of their required work to real companies instead of trying to do it inhouse with full time contributors, unless it is a kind of work that specifically benefits from being a part of the internal community and Meta. An example of this are top-tier smart contract developers that can write secure smart contracts - they typically only want to work on protocols that they have a close relationship with and lots of tokens.  The importance of a line of retreat  I agree that this is great in theory, but letting go of this allows us to make meaningful changes such as replacing the broken monolithic company-style model of the core units with incentive-driven MetaDAOs The Endgame focuses on actually building lock-in through mechanisms such as voting frontend design, delegate incentives, governance process restrictions and incentives for the GovernorDAOs  risk that Endgame fails due to lack of buy-in amongst the decentralized workforce.  Before I spent a lot of time working on the Endgame I ensured that there was the necessary buyin amongst the key contributors needed to make it work. We will of course find that all of the people who view maker more as a source of unaccountable cashflows will be strongly against the Endgame Plan as it will replace those cashflows with incentives that only trigger cash rewards if you actually deliver something of value. But it is very much to our benefit if these people leave - they are a net negative for the DAO and are better suited for working in a real company with a normal company structure, contracts, fiduciary duty etc.  that each piece of the Endgame plan is implemented (or not) individually and according to its own merits.  This is of course ideal in theory, but there are two very strong factors that make it a lot easier said than done. The first is that the Endgame Plan fundamentally is trying to deal with the unacceptable, fatal risk of having open-ended governance vacuum that acts as an attack surface where people can alter the meta and political dynamic to their own benefit. Since we have to reach a final, finite scope that actually can handle all edge cases the only way to get there is to take a holistic approach. We can\u2019t take random steps and then expect to ever reach something works holistically - we will just be digging ourselves deeper into the complexity spiral where each solution itself creates new problems. The second is that the entire approach to the workforce must be changed away from the current model of emulating a company with functions and no-questions-asked budgets poured into each function, and towards a model where budgets and resources are provided through \u201cinbuilt-KPIs\u201d, that is revenue share and bounties rather than slush budgets. That is a complete overhaul of how the workforce currently works, however, it is of course important that this overhaul is done step by step and not rushed unnecessarily.  Reinstate Exploratory and Fallback Options  This is easier said than done. There is currently no real alternative to the Endgame Plan proposed. I don\u2019t consider the status quo a viable or acceptable state, there is simply too much internal political and operational risk and external regulatory risk. Simple Dai used to be my preferred alternative, but I don\u2019t believe it is a viable option due to the deteriorated regulatory environment which makes it clear that any kind of attempt to have existential exposure to real world assets must be accompanied by a huge lobbying and PR push, and the Simple Dai design is incompatible with that.  Steelman Behaviour  I would also be happy to see someone come up with more useful arguments against the Endgame Plan - of course the key to something being useful is that it actually presents a coherent alternative, otherwise it isn\u2019t possible to actually respond or consider it logically.  Drop Governor MetaDAOs  I am modifying the plan to partially implement this change. Governors are fundamentally necessary to prevent long run corruption of the human layer (since it is an insurance against slippery slope corruption, by flipping the dynamics to make it easy to react to issues retroactively rather than putting the burden on Maker Core to prevent all issues from occuring in the first place). But they can still be delayed, and we can launch without them, which I think is a very desirable simplification - the \u201cdecentralized management\u201d layer can organize into a kind of hybrid form that is structured in councils, core units and tribunals, but without the Governors actually providing the Results Guarantees. Then we specify in the MIPs, and strongly reinforce in the meta, that the first action of the Incubator algorithm must be to simultaneously launch the two Governors, who can then smoothly adopt half of the restructured workforce each. The main risk to this approach is that in theory all roles in the decentralized workforce are incentivized to prevent the Governors from coming into existence, as the Governors will mainly just be seen as a source of irritating rules and formalities, as they will prevent them from organizing in the way that is more short term convenient for them, rather than in the long term interest of Maker (namely zero tolerance of any slippery slope behaviour that can lead to centralization or corruption). However, I believe that the starting point for our decentralized workforce is of such high quality and integrity that we can assume this risk for a year or two, and be able to succesfully launch the Governors, as long as we codify it properly through MIPs and strongly meta engineer their importance into the communities consciousness.  MetaDAOs \u2192 MetaUnits  This means giving up on the most powerful tool of Meta Engineering as well governance delegation and decentralization enforcement so I don\u2019t think it is a good idea to completely eliminate MetaDAOs. But I am of course completely onboard with not trying to turn things that shouldn\u2019t be MetaDAOs into MetaDAOs, and also making sure that we make the same incentives that are available to MetaDAOs also available to companies or external DAOs. Maybe the most important example of this are the frontend revenue share programs, which we obviously want to also make available to other frontends than just the ones the MetaDAOs run, since that just expands our growth potential even more - there are a lot of additional nuance and caveats to this though, that I won\u2019t explain here but will provide detail on in the future when I will make content that focus more specifically on the frontends and their importance in the Endgame worldview.  Reduce Organization / Management Layers  This is of course great if its possible, but the current structure was designed to deal with a lot of specific risks so we must only do simplifications if they dont open up a new threat surface, or if we determine that the threat surface is small enough that the upside of the simplification is worth it. I\u2019ll respond to each of the suggestions individually as I think that is very helpful to understanding the design principles   Simplify the internal MetaDAO structure into a single team.   This is to prevent black-box emergence in MetaDAOs where basically they become token wrappers around companies. By enforcing a maximum team size, and then enforcing that collaboration between teams follow the DAO Toolkit, it is possible to verify that a MetaDAO remains decentralized over time and doesn\u2019t succumb to political and operational centralization as it scales.   Simplify the MakerCore governance layers back to delegates + token holders, or alternatively, to DVCs + token holders.   Delegates are a very fundamental role in the Endgame Plan, since they are the beneficiaries of the voting incentives. This makes them extremely dangerous if not properly derisked, and dealing with this risk is the reason why DVCs and Budget Allocators exist and sort of \u201csqueeze\u201d them on each side to ensure that delegates only concern themselves with the exact responsibilities that they need to have.  Combine the roles of budget allocator and scope councils/tribunals.  The Budget Allocators are an optional role that specifically are meant to be fully permissionless, meaning anyone can do it - but the entire role can also be turned off, and is only useful in situations where Maker Governance believes it is important to do lots of heavy duty top-down spending. Councils are actually specifically meant to not have direct budget control, because they are the ones who create the KPIs and best practice for how to use the budget control that Budget Allocators and Core Units have. Tribunals do have budget control, but for scopes that are generally considered to be lean, meaning there is not so much risk their misspending will be obfuscatable. Before I get to the last part I just want to mention that as always I am of course on the lookout at all times for great ideas and things that can be incorporated into the Endgame Plan to simplify it and improve it in other ways. The most recent example of this is the removal of Governors from the launch MetaDAOs - I am very happy that long and others kept pushing for something like this because now that I\u2019ve found a safe way to incorporate it I think it is a very exciting and powerful improvement to the plan because it makes it a lot more manageable and likely to successfully launch the Launch MetaDAOs. Obviously as I have said many times before, even after the Endgame Approval MIPs are approved (if they approved), we will need to continue to iterate and make further improvements to the Plan. And then even as it is launched and the MetaDAOs are bootstrapped there will still be opportunities to make final changes, adjustments and improvements to the long term immutable parameters of the plan. So those who have particular views on how certain things can be improved should continue to push for those changes and then at some point we may be able to reach an acceptable compromise or viable path to implement it that doesn\u2019t trigger some other risk. Nobody wants to see the plan improved more than me, I am absolutely ecstatic when we manage to inch out even some small but significant simplifications, and especially when we can do larger improvement such as the governorDAO change which really is a gamechanger in terms of setting the launch up for success at the tradeoff of acceptable risk a few years later.  Given the points raised in this document, I believe the vote to commit to the Endgame plan is premature. Instead, I would encourage the governance community at MakerDAO to lobby for an atomic approach, taking the best parts of the Endgame plan and mitigating or discarding the riskier parts.  I think this would be the best approach for the community to take if the Endgame Plan is rejected, but I still don\u2019t believe that it is likely to succeed, and it is not something I would stay around for to be a part of myself. If the proposals are rejected I will simply accept that I\u2019ve done what I can, concede defeat and let go. If the community was able to fix its own problems in some sort of self emergent manner, I think it should have already happened - and the likelihood of it happening should be expected to go down over time, not up, in my opinion, as the longer the unsustainable status quo remains in place the more the meta will deteriorate (which the \"low morale, unhealthy debate and unrelenting criticism \" is one of the symptoms of) In general I don\u2019t consider the status quo survivable, especially not once I leave and it is unclear how the protocol will maintain governance security on top of the existing inherent risks from inside and outside. I am volunteering to spend such a massive amount of time and effort on trying to push through the Endgame Plan because its the only real chance the project will make it and there will be any point to all the work me and many others have put into over the last 7 years.
