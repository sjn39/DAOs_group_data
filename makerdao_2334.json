                    "content": "This idea is an improvement to my last topic     USDC vaults VS arbitrage reservoirs Risk       Yeah, this adds a risk to maker. It\u2019s the difference between 100% collateralization and being over collateralized.  If you\u2019re worried about Maker not making enough profit, you could propose to raise the sf on stablecoins.  There\u2019s sort of an issue with trying to set up big sell and buy walls and trying to control the price. You can just end up with big exposure to stablecoins. Also, where are we getting the capital to buy DAI and prop up the peg?  Also, talking about liquidations. That\u2019s going t\u2026      we all knew that scaling DAI using only Ether and other decentralized coins and tokens wasn\u2019t possible using centralized assets with the right risk parameters was always the plan to further scale DAI like governments bonds but the technical and legal environment is not mature yet to get these assets now\u2026 and it may take too many years to get them I think that centralized stable coins are our best shot at scaling DAI in the medium term but these stable coins have two problems that make it difficult to use them as collateral: first problem: the security problem\u2026 we could have a government force the issuer to blacklist Maker holdings of these stable coins \u2026 or the issuer of the centralized stable coin could turn out to be a scam to get hacked or whatever reason that will make the centralized stable coin lose its value second problem: it is difficult to generate fees from these stable coins because who would borrow DAI using another stablecoin and pay fees unless there is a big arbitration opportunity \u2026 and we saw how we were forced to lower SF on USDC to 0% to attract more arbitrators I think I have an idea that could significantly solve these two problems instead of having vaults for centralized stable coins we build like a reservoir with hardcoded rates for swapping DAI with usdc (for example) in this reservoir, you can mint 1 DAI for 1.01 usdc and you can sell DAI for 0.99 USDC this means that DAI peg can\u2019t go above 1.01 because anyone will use this opportunity to mint cheaper DAI using this reservoir this was my original proposal as I mentioned above the original proposal doesn\u2019t solve the first problem ( the risks of using centralized stable coins) and partially solve the second problem by generating fees from arbitration The improvement I am suggesting to the original idea is to lend most the these centralized stable coins lets say that we have 20 million usdc in the reservoir we can lend significant portion (may be 80%) to secondary lending markets like Compound and compound will lend it to its users what will we achieve here? for the first problem: if coinbase was forced to blacklist Maker holdings they will only be able to blacklist 20% of the holdings because 80% of Maker holding are lent to other users for the second problem: this will generate additional revenue for the protocol, the arbitration fees + the lending fees of course we can further lower the risks by having a basket of centralized stable coins like USDC, USDT, Binance USD, TUSD to any other stable coin with significant liquidity ",

                    "content": "Sory my feedback is not about implementing your idea but more about your assumptions and stablecoins in general.     mmoossttaaffaa:  we all knew that scaling DAI using only Ether and other decentralized coins and tokens wasn\u2019t possible   I think that\u2019s a wrong assumption in the medium term (2-4 years). ETH is far from reaching trillions of USD in MCap. Sure if we offer stablecoins as collateral, many speculators will use that option - it might help MKR earn fees, but will it help DAI build its reputation and security?     mmoossttaaffaa:  I think that centralized stable coins are our best shot at scaling DAI in the medium term   I think the reason why DAI has only about 150M supply is its inability to keep the peg. We can try to fix the peg by using centralized coins and risky collateral or change the DAI design. I am definitely for changing the design otherwise we just have a slightly more decentralized USDC/USDT. In that case I guess it\u2019s better to just use a basket of semi-centralized coins and handle the risk through insurance or diversification.     mmoossttaaffaa:  I think that centralized stable coins are our best shot at scaling DAI in the medium term   I think porting DAI to layer 2 is more important as high fees will make DAI suitable only for whales.
