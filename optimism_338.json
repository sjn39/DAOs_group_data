Benefits:  As a market leader in the growing DEX aggregation field, 1inch Network has the capacity to bootstrap further adoption of Optimism network. Attract more developers and builders to the Optimism ecosystem and help them bring their vision to the market.  How will the OP tokens be distributed? $300,000OP tokens would be used to incentivise usage and growth of Optimism on 1inch Network thought the 1inch Wallet App. With the amount for incentives, the team would:  Launch an AirDrop Campaign for top wallets that are funded in 1inch Wallet App for iOS and Android in Ethereum or Optimism. The 1inch Labs will conduct an airdrop on Optimism network.     Announcement and Intention From https://blog.1inch.io/1inch-wallet-users-to-be-rewarded-with-op-tokens-eb6595192999, dated 9/6 at the start of the program. From what I can gather, there was no previous announcement; that is, this is  a true retro airdrop, not one as implied by the proposal.  The 1inch Network is thrilled to announce that a total of 300,000 OP tokens will be distributed among the 1inch Wallet\u2019s users in a move to incentivize their activity on the Optimism network.   The distribution will be made in a retrospective Merkle drop. The OP tokens will be equally distributed between 3,782 selected wallets of the 1inch Wallet\u2019s most active and regular users, and are already available for claiming. For a detailed instruction on how to claim OP tokens on Optimism, please, head to the 1inch Help Center.   Distribution 9/5 Governance distributes 300k OP to 0x1bd315E3F029083DA8731a6b1c6F2959A0d15376 Wallet transfers all OP to 0xea1e11e3d448f31c565d685115899a11fd98e40e, which programmatically distributes 79 OP to designated wallets. In 72 days, 253 of the 3,782 wallets have claimed their share of the airdrop, with the current rate being roughly 1 claim per day.  image492\u00d7529 15.8 KB  There are 280k OP remaining; at the current rate of claims, it will take just under 10 years for these 3,782 wallets to have gotten their money. After scanning a few of the recipient wallets to determine evidence of increased use, I eventually stopped my analysis at this point, given this grant\u2019s application as a retro airdrop and the low, flat rate of OP distributed.  Observation and Recommendation  This was a retroactive airdrop, which was not detailed in the governance proposal. There is little if any evidence of benefit to Optimism as a result of this grant; the total number of potential wallets is relatively low, and very few wallets have been involved to date. Even if the pace were somehow to increase, the total number of potential wallets is limited due to the retro airdrop, and it\u2019s not clear what the catalyst for such an increase would be. 1inch should thus consider returning the remaining 280k OP, as it seems that nobody is really going to benefit here going forward; we could use this OP for other purposes. EDIT: It\u2019s in an immutable merkle distributor contract, so the OP is effectively bricked.   Caveat If 1inch did in fact heavily promote this airdrop ahead of time, this could be considered in scope, if not evidently successful. I invite any corrections on this point. ",

Tokens bridged via Optimism\u2019s gateway (the official bridge) is always treated as the canonical bridged token on Optimism. When a user bridges a token, say USDC, from chain X to Optimism, the user adds USDC liquidity in the Chain X side of the pool and removes liquidity from the Optimism side. The depth of the liquidity pool on the Optimism side determines bridge pricing and size of liquidity bridgeable via cBridge. Therefore, it is beneficial for the Optimism community to incentivize a deep liquidity pool on Optimism\u2019s side with $OP token especially in the early stage of ecosystem growth.   Other context: Celer had already been running incentives with its native token, so the largest wallets had already been farming. What was strange was that the largest wallets were repeatedly depositing and withdrawing their liquidity, which might indicate the intention was to game some sort of reward. Celer rewarding USDC, USDT, and ETH 150K OP: gas rebates for bridging  cBridge can facilitate that structure by covering a portion of the gas fee that the user needs to pay. For example, if a user bridges 10 USDC from Avalanche, instead of getting $9.5 with the $0.5 covering the gas costs on Optimism, she would now get $9.8 with $0.3 covered by cBridge through $OP token distribution to Celer\u2019s validator networks.  200K OP: builder grant    [GF: Phase 0 Proposal] Celer Network     cBridge widget integration. cBridge functionality can be integrated with any dApp through a web widget. We will allocate a certain amount of $OP based on the total bridging volume of all the integrated dApps. Among the integrated dApps,the $OP tokens will be distributed proportionally to bridged volume from their integrated widget.  Cross-chain dApps built with Celer that makes onboarding and using Optimism easier. Celer IM allows users from other chains to experience apps on Optimism with ease. This allows app builders to build applications native to Optimism and do not need to migrate their apps with multiple copies to other chains to accept users there. Instead, they can acquire users by providing a capability to allow users on other chains to directly interact with Optimism based dApps with one-click UX.

However, of the top four wallets, only #2, 0x089, is still farming.1 This could mean that much of the distribution has yet to be claimed by large providers still farming.

Unused 880k OP remains in EOA  Brief performance analysis  TVL Overall, across chains, Celer\u2019s TVL has decreased ~30% since 8/42  image1268\u00d7455 36.4 KB  On Optimism, Celer\u2019s TVL has roughly tracked that decrease, but some recent deposits have brought it almost back up to the start of the period.3 From my view, taking out the recent deposit, this suggests that the grant hasn\u2019t had a meaningful impact on liquidity.  image1369\u00d7440 22.9 KB   Activity More transaction volume (particularly inbound) is an intended second-order effect of the grant. The data suggest that the grant hasn\u2019t noticeably facilitated bridge activity. On Optimism, Celer has decreased 1 percentage point in transaction share since August. from ~3.4% to 2.3%4  image922\u00d7375 58.1 KB  Across crypto, Celer\u2019s 1m volume is roughly 20% the amount of the leader, Multichain. On Optimism, it is only 4% of the leader, the Optimism Gateway, and 5% of the #2 bridge, Multichain.5 Again, there doesn\u2019t appear to have been a meaningful increase in share, which is what one would expect to occur as a result of this grant.  image1399\u00d7292 80.9 KB   Observation and recommendations  Get the 880k EOA-custodied OP to a multisig asap Distribution to date seems properly managed and not obviously to related parties, though any related parties are likely to still have their liquidity in and thus likely not to have claimed rewards yet. A more thorough analysis would identify the largest liquidity providers to this bridge. This grant doesn\u2019t appear to have been deployed to any real effect. It could be worth revisiting the length of time used on this grant or the timing (maybe the moment isn\u2019t right). Or, if the Grants Council has the authority, they could even revisit the scope of the grant in collaboration with Celer. It might be interesting to evaluate the grant distribution on bridges relative to activity.

Observations  This is a lot of undeployed OP (and this is only for one phase), and it\u2019s worth checking in with these projects to see what has held them up, whether it\u2019s operational issues, market conditions, changes in plans, lack of demand for builder grants, etc. It could be worth coordinating the release of these lingering incentives at a planned date. It could also be interesting to see whether these projects\u2019 outlooks or strategies have changed in any way and explore potential changes in scope. Past a point there\u2019s got to be something like a deadline to start these grants; are we going to honor them if projects don\u2019t claim funds by a year from now, for example?  ",

If a project is in distress, it could be worth Optimism\u2019s while to find a way to support it, but determining whether and how best to support should be a cooperative effort between governance and a grantee. Otherwise, the OP ought to be returned. ",

Observations This program appears to have been more or less followed to the letter. The next step of analysis for this (and, really, any other grant) would be to assess the efficacy of these handouts.
