                    "content": "woo hoo. Very cool.   Everyone is welcome!! Rather not introduce myself by name at this point.   Everyone can just call me MakerMan.    How I was introduced to Maker.    Tough one.   I trade a lot of Ethereum and frequent reddit /r/ethtrader so I probably ran into Maker there.   geographically US.   Background - Long time freelance IT consult team lead on heavy iron (all forms of Unix BSD/SYSV variants) sysadm/system analyst specializing in restoring IT operations and process optimization.   Education - physicist M.S. Solid State Theoretical Physics, Plasma Physics, Chemical Physics with a strong secondary background in EE (Both Analog and Digital with a focus on Digital), Human Machine Interface design and optimization, controls, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint.   Interests are far too numerous to list but run the full gamut from astrophysics, to nuclear and almost everything in between.   Strong personal interest in poker, game theory, social dynamics, etc.   Why I am here.   Because I think MakerDAO is probably the most interesting thing going on in the crypto space at this point as well as Ethereum and I have a desire to contribute in a positive way to this project.   Given I have worked in a lot of business environments both as an owner and consultant I have a pretty strong financial background and interest in the DeFi space.   Given my interests and fields of study are so diverse I consider myself to have a strong multidisciplinary background and can bring knowledge/studies from many fields to particular problems that most can\u2019t.   Something you will learn from me because everyone who gets to know me knows they are my pet phrases when it comes to \u2018proposals\u2019.   I will often ask. What is the goal?  and By what method(s) will we measure the achievement (or failure) of that goal?   I find good answers to the above two questions to drive success or failure and realize quite often we have to try 1000 times and fail to succeed once.   A friend put it a better way.   To able to be the genius you have to be willing to be the fool. Usually with high powered individuals there is a lot of ego and emotion.   I continue to work to moderate this because negativity rarely creates a positive result practically as well as socially.  ",

I still maintain some mysteries, though tbh it\u2019s whatever man. I\u2019m based in NY. Some background: I graduated from Baruch College in 2016 with a BA in Corporate Communications. I had no idea what I wanted to do professionally while I was in college, so I went for a general degree that I found interesting and useful. I am fascinated by many topics and am a total skeptic about almost everything that falls into my lap. I self-study the things I am curious about and have not believed too strongly in school being the main source of someone\u2019s education. Although it is a very amazing resource for the students who take advantage. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by computer science, communications, finance, mathematics, organizations, ethics, and most recently financial risk management(the list can really go on and on.) I found out about MakerDAO in early 2017 after my buddy, Andrew, wouldn\u2019t shut up about it. After months of his badgering, I finally read the whitepaper. I became fascinated by MakerDAO and the potential it has. So, for the next couple of years, I hung out in the chat and Reddit community before being hired by the Maker Foundation to work on Community Development alongside Rich Brown. ",

Computer i can say advance level overall, overclocking , Now starting to learn to code as much i can since it\u2019s the race for Crypto and the world of internet will explose sooner or later. Administration and data for Machine Learning, Network Security and many more. My Interest are very global . Artificial Intelligence, i have a lot of interest into this direction and also robotics, everything around these area related from close or far. VR are a big  role i think in a futur that can be associated with AI and crypto if you have a open-mind, sports, 3D dev and mod, Video-Games\u2026 I think one of my favorite is theory and phylosophy. Antique and archeologie , symbols and language. I think what you are doing is part of a contribution in a better-world and a major change that will lead to multiple beneficial situations or idea.

                    "content": "Hi everyone My name is Adrien. Note that I\u2019ve updated this in May 2021 for the DAO members curious to know more. I\u2019m based in Barcelona (Spain) and Sinai (Egypt). Traveling often to France, Switzerland & Germany. I speak English, French, Spanish and conversational German. I used to be a software dev for 8 years and transitioned to non-programming positions when entering full-time into crypto. I currently (2021) usually work in Marketing position but my passion for crypto led me to build a lot of knowledge across many aspects of the space in which I consulted and/or contributed: tokenomics, fundraising, research, analysis, vetting-processes, community building, events, and more. I was introduced to Maker in 2017, probably while reading frantically (what a time to enter the blockchain space) tbh I don\u2019t remember. Maker was already standing out as one of the strongest projects out there and DAI as the purest form of crypto-dollar. I\u2019ve been a strong supporter of DAI since then. Here is a breakdown of my involvement in the crypto industry:   TLDR: I am a self-taught crypto-native working full time in the crypto industry since late 2017. I have deep knowledge across topics such as L1s, L2s, DeFi, DAOs, NFTs, Tokenomics Design, Marketing and Community Building.   In 2018, I was an analyst for a crypto VC which was very enlightening, I learnt the ins-and-outs of crypto investments, analyzed and vetted 100s of projects, connected and interviewed dozens of startup founders. I witnessed many private investors & businesses bleed during the 2018-19 crypto winter, the conclusion was inevitable: the crypto space needs better treasury risk management and stable coins are key to achieving that goal.   In 2019, I consulted for a blockchain-for-good project called ixo, building a full blown ecosystem on top of Cosmos in order to make all parties involved in the sustainability space interact more efficiently & in new ways (read: better, cheaper, faster, more transparent and enabling new use cases).   In 2019, I got very involved in three DAOs: GenesisDAO (DAOstack mini-grant DAO), PolkaDAO (polkadot\u2019s mini grant DAO) and FestDAO (mini-grant DAO for meetups). Track record here, here and here. Note that they all ran on DaoStack and that I was a strong advocate for the use of DAI in these DAOs which earned me quite some trouble at the time.   In 2020, I collaborated on the Cosmos lead crosschain standard for NFTs and Metadata effort as part of a new engagement with ixo network (c.f. 2019 paragraph above). This involved investigation across all chains regarding their NFT standards, formats and adoption. Outcome on interNFT.org.   In 2020-21 I got involved with aleph.im, doing Marketing and Comms for this crosschain decentralized project. Creating foundational content such as Deck and Papers (light paper, technical paper, etc), strategizing and running social media accounts, supporting the BD team with DDs and much more.   2018-present: I organize and facilitate many events with the long term goal to build sound communities that stay active and united no matter the state of the market. I run 50+ events and still love doing this as I find this extremely rewarding. The outcomes have been amazing personally and for many of the community members involved. A highlight on that: I run an evening of participative DAO events during EthCC 2020 with 120+ attendees, partially sponsored by Maker, on a shoestring budget of $630.

I can\u2019t remember exactly how I was introduced to Maker, I\u2019ve been following the crypto space for years, so it was pretty logical that at some point I\u2019d discover it. I also participated in a crypto project at the start of the bear market and did the cryptoeconomics of the stablecoin we envisioned for our system. We didn\u2019t raise enough to meet our soft cap, reimbursed investors and closed the business. Now that I think about it I might have stumbled upon Maker while researching stablecoins at that time. My interest about it has grown since then and I think it has great potential. I\u2019m a small holder of MKR, I have some DAI in DSR, I have used Compound and voted a couple of times. I\u2019m from France, in Lyon to be precise. This is the point where I apologize for my english, I understand it perfectly but my sentences construction can get weird. I\u2019m a 28 years old electronics and IT engineer, I work as a freelance in web full stack dev,  and am creating a web business on the side. I am more of a generalist than a specialist, even though 4 years of web dev has made me pretty good in Node/React/GraphQL stuff. On the technological side I\u2019m interested in security and cryptography, blockchain tech, and generally try to stay informed on tech (theoretical and innovation, not the startup ecosystem). Outside of tech my main interests are economics, mainly monetary policy and development economics, with a focus on heterodox economics (main reads: Michael Hudson, Dani Rodrik, Erik Reinert, Steve Keen, David Graeber, Richard Werner, Ha-Joon Chang, \u2026). I keep an eye on geopolitics, but I\u2019m not remotely close to being an expert on that. I trade a bit of BTC with low leverage/low expectations, I find the discipline and social aspects of it interesting. The thing that triggered my registering here is that I wanted to post this: Thoughts about governance security and logic I\u2019ve posted a bit on the Maker Reddit, but I\u2019d be happy to discuss here too.

Now I think it\u2019s one of the most impressive inventions of the last decade and think this community is going to be the prototype for the most interesting teamwork of the next one. I\u2019ve definitely learned a lot about Finance as I\u2019ve followed MKR/DAI and other crypto projects, but my primary interest is in online communities and the future of companies. I think MakerDAO is the most interested DAO today but I\u2019m also excited about all of the DAO work happening with Aragon. I\u2019m looking forward to learning more with y\u2019all! ",

I am based in south-east Australia and havelegal background currently working in insurance disputes - far from the realm of decentralised finance. I find myself here on this forum as in the pursuit of what next to study I cannot shake this interest in crytocurrencies, stablecoins, blockchain, and the like. My interests all stem from fascination with understanding the development, function, and regulation of society.

I messed up anonymity on the internet a looong time ago like many others of my age, so you can call me Leo, Mitote or whatever you want really (btw Mitote comes from The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz). Like @Davidutro someone named Andrew introduced me to ethereum in September 2017 and I found Maker that November on reddit. I started really trying to learn the protocol around the start of SCD. I definitely did alot more lurking than participating, it took awhile to feel confident enough in the system dynamics. I\u2019m here because its more compelling than what I see elsewhere. My development lead me to hate (I\u2019m learning the power of love) aspects of civilization and society. I guess that I am at least a little younger than all of you, so I don\u2019t have a ton of relevant professional experience and kinda just wing these intellectual/academicy things cause I\u2019m curious. My main interests and goals evolve around ecology, biology, biochemistry (increasingly the electric potentials in biology, so bio-physical-chemistry?idk), but everything is really f*cking interesting and I am so very novice in all of it. I also read about economics, history/sociology, physics, behavioral stuff, cosmology. I have a love hate relationship with science/logic, so I got some other stuff going on to get out of that mode. Oh I live in the US, briefly went to university, but thought it was silly. I got paid for work on the collateral application process, but that\u2019s the extent of my involvement with the foundation.

I\u2019ll keep my location private for now because these things make me paranoid, but I\u2019m looking forward to the extra time this will afford me to get involved in Maker. I found out about Maker two 2 years ago in Tokyo where I met a member of the team (but don\u2019t recall the name). I didn\u2019t understand it at the time but I grasp it much better now. I appreciate Maker as a tool for taking decentralized leverage. I think this will (and is) being used to build interesting financial products that will lead to not only a stable Dai, but a (relatively) stable Eth. As a software developer I write a lot of Typescript (aka strongly typed Javascript), Python and Golang. I also have a strong interest in web security and a hobby interest in economics. Cheers! ",

I\u2019m a technology professional from the semiconductor industry, but starting a six month software engineering bootcamp in a few weeks.  Moving from hardware to software. I discovered cryptocurrency (bitcoin) in 2016, and was instantly fascinated.  I would love to work in blockchain development.  I do technical writing on the side a little bit (realtechwriter.com).  At the beginning of January, someone paid me for my work in Dai, and I had never heard of it.  I started nosing around online and stumbled into the forum and chat area where I found the Help wanted for a Governance summary.  I am pleased to be learning about the platform and Governance.  I take weekly snapshots of the issues and produce a summary that can be found at mkrdai.info  . The community here is very welcoming, and I appreciate that.  I think the MakerDAO culture and currencies have what it takes to bring cryptocurrency into the hands of the everyday person.  I would love to live in a world where it\u2019s as easy to spend a DAI as it is a DOLLAR. ",

I made my way to this forum because I wanted to be involved. I have no code skills, but I do have a large interest in finance. Decentralized Finance is an area I am always trying to learn more about. I am based out of the east coast USA. I am a project manger during the day, which helps pay some of my bills and feed my family.  However I am always learning more about blockchain, finance, and language. I want to contribute however I can to this effort, so please feel free to contact me and keep me in mind.  As I mentioned I am not a developer or posses much technical know how. Given the fact DeFi is relatively new, and most work being done is technical, I hope to find ways to contribute. See you around!  ",

From an academic background I\u2019m a public accountant with an MBA from ieem and a master in blockchain from universidad de salamanca (not recomended), currently doing the cfa although I\u2019m currently quite lazy to study. From a professional background started in pwc in assurance were I was the first 7 years, later went to a dutch maritime company in uy as A&F manager reporting to HQ and later to an argentinean company as corporate A&F manager. Basically most of my profesional life is around organizational skills, group management, internal controls, accounting & finance. I got introduced to maker through ethereum, while doing the mba with a couple of friends in 2017 we started mining ethereum (small totally losing operation ) and then i started getting interested in blockchain technology, in particular ethereum. After that during 2018 started heavily analyzing projects, specially maker dao and how it kept the peg during the crypto dump and so I decided to become a mkr hodler. I have been reading the forums for a while and just since mainly the covid lockdown started to participate . Happy to meet such a great community  ",

To me this is enabling a system for the little guy. No longer are only the wealthiest individuals able to collateralize their assets for spending power, anyone who is long crypto and understands a few basic tenants of risk management can do everything from provide purchasing power at low interest rates to take advantage of yield spreads across the market.

My grandparents emigrated from Europe before WWII, so I have the German nationality as well. I plan to live in Berlin someday. I\u2019m a Computer Engineer from Colombia\u2019s best private university, and a Linguist from Colombia\u2019s best public university. I graduated at the same time from both universities. I like rock climbing, tree climbing, tennis, yoga and African dance. I\u2019m a vegetarian. I\u2019m very interested in space exploration. I like talking about politics and philosophy. I speak Spanish, English, French and German.  Today was my first governance call and I didn\u2019t understand much. But I love new challenges. See you around! Emilio ",

However, to most of you, I am a new face. I have been invested in cryptocurrency and blockchain infrastructure for several years now.  I had the opportunity to begin working with David to help moderate and perform quality analysis of the Governance and Risk Meeting Summaries. This task allowed me to get more comfortable with Maker and some of its infrastructure. I have yet to meet all of you personally, but I already have this feeling that the Maker community is one of the best there is. Work environment and team communication is the most critical part of a healthy and efficient organization. Therefore, it is essential to me. I graduated from CUNY Hunter College with a bachelor\u2019s degree in pre-medicine. Interestingly enough, I later had a self-discovery of my true passions: economy, markets, and business (in addition to a few other strong hobbies like health and fitness). I have been working with Amazon GREF (Global Real Estate and Facilities) as a subcontractor for site-specific Business Services for two years. This role consisted of maintenance, assistance, and routine reporting of Amazon Advertising and AWS on-site business-related technology and office workflow. Later, I was promoted to site assistant manager. I currently act as the single East Coast Operational Subject Matter Expert for the Amazon GREF and Subcontractor Project Management Dept (unfortunately, a duty that\u2019s above my pay grade). Otherwise, I spend most of my day running Monthly Operational Reports, Site Procedure Guides, New Hiree Training, and Weekly Team Collaborative Meeting Calls. Currently, I am helping to manage the rollout of a vast software replacement across all Amazon GREF locations in the world. This involves monitoring East Coast workflow, legacy data integrations, and customer ease of use through the software UI. Prior to this, while I was studying for MCATS, I co-ran an LLC private investment company for a handful of individuals, which included money management, data management, and of course, time management. After coming home from a long day of work and a wonderful hour-long commute, I spend the rest of my evening performing fundamental and technical analysis on U.S. equities and commodities. I trade using unique and self-developed option strategies. On the weekend mornings, I go to the gym to allow myself to continue eating pasta and Hot Pockets before bed. Thanks for reading  ",

Some of your names look very familiar because I have been getting notifications about your discussions since then. I want to make a self-introduction anyway as I haven\u2019t got a chance to do so. I had been a journalist with Bloomberg for more than a decade. While I was with Bloomberg interviewing asset management companies, pension fund managers searching for yields that were gradually diminishing, I had come to realize that something must be done to improve the financial system. Monetary easing isn\u2019t the answer. That concern and my hope for a world with more equal opportunities prompted me to join the blockchain space in 2017 and Maker in 2019. Maker Foundation was set up to bootstrap the Maker protocol with a mission to create a digital currency that can be used by anyone, anywhere. With Dai, universal access to financial services has now become possible. I am glad to be part of this community and excited for the changes we will make together. ",

I\u2019m based in Vietnam and deeply connected with the growing tech, blockchain community here.   My background is in logistics and supply chain technology. 2 years ago when blockchain was buzzing around town for its innovative technology, I was really curious to see how it can be adapted in my industry. Unfortunately, at the time, I came to the conclusion that it was not the time for blockchain to changing the oldest industry in the world. So I moved on but closely monitor the developments and stay in touch with many blockchain folks in Vietnam.   Fast forward to 2020, I started my business podcast about Vietnam and interviewed some blockchain team here, that\u2019s when I got introduced to Maker SEA community lead - Jocelyn. We did an interview together in Jan 2021, and I was deeply curious about how will Maker collaterize real-world assets on chain. She took the time to explain to me and introduce me to ShuttleOne - one of the team who is working closely with Maker to make this happen.   And now, I\u2019m the latest member in  the ShuttleOne team to make blockchain integration within the supply chain industry happen. I\u2019m deeply fascinated with how Maker has innovated decentralized finance and continue to learn from the community is a priviledge! ",

As a Thai citizen, it is very difficult to get access to financial services especially a \u201cline of credit\u201d and borrow against your assets (of course, unless you are in the 0.1%). This is one of the main reasons why I think Maker can be a game changer for a country like Thailand and other 2nd/3rd world countries. Recently, I have been super excited to work with the Centrifuge team on launching a Tinlake pool and plan to submit a MIP6 on Maker soon. I am an exec at a Canadian based alternative financing company focused on the regulated cannabis industry called CapitalNow Cannabis. Any way, just wanted to introduce myself and look forward to making the leap from a user/investor to a potential contributor to the Maker and defi ecosystem. If anyone is currently in Thailand or Vancouver, would love to connect! ",

I am from California and live in Santa Cruz, where we used to have a Maker office (shout out to my Santa Cruz OGs!).  I studied Psychology at CSU Chico then moved to Tahoe after I graduated to enjoy life as a ski bum.  I ended up moving back to the Bay Area after 7 years of skiing and traveling the world.  I worked at Virgin America as a Flight Controller for 2 years.  Then I moved on to work for Facebook, managing their Design Team Onboarding Program, then as a Team  Lead in Media Operations.  I found Maker over 3 years ago when a recruiter reached out to me about a job opening.  It\u2019s been a wild ride and I have absolutely loved it.  Working at the Foundation has been the best job I have ever had. Now that the Foundation is winding down, I am going to be participating more in the Community, which I am really looking forward to!

I also have a background in coding (mainly quantitive non-linear statistical applications c#) and but nothing on blockchain(s) so I am currently in the relatively early stages of learning (Solidity, JS, Python - even I confess HTML) . I\u2019m fascinated by the solution found by Maker to create a truly decentralized stable coin. However, I confess that there are elements I don\u2019t understand. Could someone please tell me if there is an \u2018educational\u2019 part of this forum I can go to, to ask questions and learn? Many thanks Phil ",

Background - I currently am your average joe working as a paramedic in a hospital system. My brother introduced me into the crypto space and after a lot of research I found a lot of potential with Maker and have become interested. I have been doing a immense amount of research in all aspects of the crypto space in subjects I\u2019m sure a lot of the DAO is already pretty well versed on. I am here to be a shadow and learn currently and hopefully one day have enough fundamental education on MakerDAO to give unbiased insight on how the average person like me may view the DAO. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have a lot of questions throughout the next couple months and I want to thank the DAO for putting up with me while I get some bearings on this amazing project!

There is quite a number of informal organisations out there in the real world, which has already developped ways of decentralised goivernance and I am keen to learn more about how this works on-chain. Actually, governance-related questions made me dive into the rabbit hole of DLT - first joining the STEEM- now HIVE-community. Today, I\u2019m involved in several projects, planning to move from a centralised kick-off organisation towards a DAO. At the moment I\u2019d be very interested to get hold on the articles of association of the Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation, since we\u2019re discussing to set up a foundation like this as well. Would be great to get some support on this. Best regards Jan ",

I am 25 years old and I am from Argentina. Self-taught student of blockchain technology, javascript (node.js) and solidity. I have a background in industrial design, having studied for more than two years. I am passionate about scientific epistemology. I have very good fundamental analysis skills, so I am interested in researching mechanisms and tools to facilitate, through technology, people\u2019s daily tasks. Cypherpunk activist, I consider myself a crypto enthusiast and fundamentalist. I have been studying economics for several years (on my own) and for 8 months I have been spending full time in the crypto ecosystem. As I said before, on my twitter account, I am trying to teach people who are interested in blockchain projects to integrate more easily. And since one of my favorite passions is writing, I use it to put together informative threads. Obviously I\u2019m still letting go and there\u2019s a lot to learn. Now a bit about why I\u2019m here. I have always been curious about technology, so when I found out that cryptocurrencies existed, and therefore protocols such as MakerDAO, my interest increased considerably. I was recently on a meeting call to join as an ambassador for this community in the Latin American region. As expected, I am very impressed with everything that is happening in here. All the work that day by day builds this community with people from all over the world is incredible. What I am most passionate about this protocol is all the internal infrastructure that leads to one of the most used tokens in the entire crypto ecosystem. Being the first stable currency in the Ethereum blockchain, I am fascinated by the different variables of use that it has. So I would like to be able to learn from its foundations, how it was created, to how it is currently supported. Thank you all very much for the space!   ",

I collected and learned a lot of basic information about the crypto world in general during that time and for about 2 months I have been delving into DeFi since it seems to me one of the most interesting spaces. These last few weeks I had the pleasure of meeting the world of DAOs, that was where, exploring the existing diversity, I met Maker for the first time and after hearing him name it in various events and spaces on Twitter I had to investigate more, that\u2019s how I ended up adding to this community and I hope to be able to contribute from my humble knowledge as well as from my professional and personal experience. The decision to join Maker came not only from a matter of personal curiosity about how it evolved, how the transition is being built or how its processes are, but also because of the possibilities offered by being part of a leading organization, it is a platform from not only can you learn, it offers the possibility of being part and collaborating in its construction in the future and all this with the plus of having the support of a nascent regional community. The possibilities are endless, I hope in the not so distant future to be able to implement what I have learned with you in projects that help communities outside of crypto to enter this world or improve through the technologies and processes that they provide us. During this process of learning, participation and continuous collaboration, I aspire to add my grain of sand so that Maker is the best possible version. GN frens! Nahuel. ",

I was first red pilled in November of 2021 after listening to a Bankless episode that talked about EIP-1559 and its implications for ETH. As a Finance major, this explanation of the mechanics behind the blockchain allowed for me to finally see a semblance of traditional value (as derived from a discounted cash flow analysis) in the ecosystem. This has progressed to where I am now, trying to get more involved in the community and attempting to learn more about the financial applications of crypto. I am eager to learn more about Maker and DAI, as well as to see new financial applications developed for the ecosystem. To me, crypto represents a better financial system that more efficient, more inclusive, and has an infinite amount of possibility to create an endless amount of financial applications and instruments. The creativity of the space inspires me, and I am hopeful to find a career in crypto and contribute to the progress that has been made. I truly hope to become a valuable member of the Maker Community and begin my contributory journey in crypto here! ",

I started my career in investment banking (M&A and Debt, mostly). Then, I transitioned to the VC/PE industry in which I co-founded an AgFintech that provides financial services to our massive national livestock segment, inside the largest equity investor in the brazilian agribusiness sector. It\u2019s been an incredible journey of leveraging technology, creativity and pragmatism to reach the far-distant corners of Brazil to solve the farmers\u2019 needs for credit and other financial services (a great share of them are unbanked and have difficulties in dealing with technology). In the meantime, I\u2019ve been studying and following crypto/blockchain technologies closely, as a hobby. Actually, my engineering bachelor\u2019s final paper was on \u201cReal Estate Tokenization on Blockchain\u201d, one of the first academic papers of the sort in Brazil. On top of that, my entrepreneurial journey opened my eyes to Defi applied to \u201creal life\u201d, and I felt I needed to dive deep, even if represents dedicating myself full-time to it. I genuinely believe this is a game-changer, and I\u2019m completely aligned with Maker\u2019s values as to how to operate as a DAO and therefore achieve these ambitious goals.

I\u2019m currently an equity analyst/portfolio manager for a boutique wealth management firm where I\u2019m responsible for about $100 million in individual stocks. I have a master\u2019s in finance and am a CFA charterholder. I have to use anon accounts because compliance restricts me from posting on social media (I\u2019ll be free once I find new crypto job). Last year I discovered DeFi and had a lightbulb moment about how profound an impact it could have on the world. I began investing in tokens and experimenting with dapps. I took courses on crypto and began consuming any online research materials I could find. I\u2019m finally ready to leave my TradFi life behind and join Web3. I believe every TradFi product/service should be looked at to see if it can be reimagined with this new technology. I have a personal connection to all of this because my family is from Cyprus and my wife is from Russia. We have experienced seeing people treated unfairly by governments and banks. I think MakerDAO has great potential to be a strong institution for getting unbanked and underbanked people access to money, credit and financial services. I hope to find a way to contribute to this mission. I think I might be able to help with RWA product and strategy. I\u2019m also happy to participate in educational discussions about finance concepts. Nice to meet you all. ",

I found out about Maker last year from my friend Payton who works for the organization, and I\u2019ve been self-studying about blockchain for a while now, with more keenness recently. I studied English, philosophy, and film in college, and those are three areas that remain important to me. In the philosophy zone, I find postmodernism, phenomenology, and OOO to be quite absorbing. With film, a few of my favorite directors are Lynch, Tarkovsky, and Ozu. Mark Fisher\u2019s writings and lectures inform a lot of my outlook on society. Maker interests me because it seems to me that a stablecoin has the most likelihood for mass adoption of crypto, it\u2019s been an established fixture of the market, and as someone who is interested in alternate forms of governance generally, I\u2019m curious about DAOs. I\u2019m hoping to learn a whole lot more about the possibilities presented by blockchain technology for creating more just communities. I can contribute my sharp critical eye, ability to understand both the creative and logical sides of any topic, and strong belief that the world is primed in this moment for a broad and deep shift that improves the lives of all. Thanks for reading.  ",

Really excited to get involved in the community to bring more real estate to DeFi and diversify MakerDao\u2019s portfolio across more real world assets. My background is in commercial real estate. I spent 2.5 years at Marcus and Millichap working with top brokerage teams across all asset types. I exclusively worked on institutional deals above $15 Million between senior leadership. My trojan horse into Web3 was metaverse real estate. It opened my eyes to the greater Web3 ecosystem and underlying technology it offers. I quit my job a little over a year ago to pursue real estate use-cases in Web3 full time. Since quitting corporate:  I became an active member of Urban Land Institute, the largest non-profit real estate organization, and have lead and developed panels on real estate and Web3. I started working on a Real Estate and Web3 masterclass for Urban Land Institute I started contributing as a writer for NFT Plazas. The leading news source for NFT related news. I spearheaded the metaverse explorer series and Decetraland research reports. ! Developed a data analytics product for metaverse real estate with my technical lead, Ryan Silva. We have a fully developed API and data warehouse for all Decetraland related real estate data. I worked with metaverse related startups and private-equity real estate firms to purchase and develop their business plan for the land. I consulted for RedSwan.io, a commercial real estate tokenized marketplace, and learned the ins and outs of how the business operates.  I have entrenched myself in Web3 and how it can change real estate. From the underlying technology to DeFi, Web3 will truly revolutionize commercial real estate. I am enamored with the idea of furthering real estate\u2019s reach in MakerDAO as an untapped and one of the most popular investment vehicles. My goal is to create a platform that facilitates MakerDAO partnerships with institutional real estate funds. These funds provide exposure to high-quality real estate for MakerDAO and MakerDAO provides a line of credit at rates unheard of in the traditional financial system. Win - Win. I have already been working with the Real World Finance Unit to compile all the HVB documentation. Here is the document and will be continuously updated as I work closer with the RWF Core Unit. ",

I work as the head of BaaS and Tech Strategy for Lineage Bank in Franklin TN (20 minutes south of Nashville). We just had a call this morning with couple of your collateral managers to learn more about how Lineage could foster a relationship with the community. Though I have been in the crypto space since 2016, my business partner and I decided to move away from mining and genesis projects with Amoveo, Raven and a couple others to focus on opportunities for broader adoption and meaningful use cases. We realized that this effort would need the involvement of traditional finance. In 2019 we partnered up with other investors and tenured local bankers who have taken a denovo bank in 2007 to 4 billion in assets and an IPO on NYSE. (Formerly Franklin Synergy Bank) to seed a raise to acquire a bank in west Tennessee. We finalized the acquisition in Jan 2020 of the single bank holding company and relocated the bank charter to Nashville area. This was the smallest chartered FDIC regulated bank by assets in TN state at 27 MM. 18 months later we are 200 MM. Middle TN has enjoyed explosive growth these last 10 years. Our commercial lending market (Williamson County) further enjoys one of the lowest commercial loan default ratios in the US. The bank is bursting at the seams with growth, but that growth is slowed by the demands of capital ratios regulated institutions are required to maintain. Our BaaS business has grown to 80 MM in deposits and our commercial loan portfolio is just north of 100 MM with over 200 MM in originated CRE loans which have been participated because our capital ratios will not allow us to keep that on our balance sheet. We would love to learn more about the community\u2019s appetite for not only the type of assets you are investing in with HVB, but also if the community would be interested in a senior debt offering to the bank\u2019s holding company (which owns 100% of Lineage Bank.) A senior debt offering would/could include other participants, such as banks and garner a 7%+ yield to go along with high quality commercial paper yields generated from our local market. We are happy to network and get as acquainted with the community as the community desires. We are connected to several crypto communities in discord. I am personally acquainted with founders of projects in the NFT space, Synapse (SYN) and successful DA funds. We are excited to see MakerDAO working with traditional finance to grow asset diversity amongst it\u2019s community and impressed with the approach. We hope to learn as much as we can and see how Lineage can meaningfully work with you all. Thanks for your time. Shawn ",

My hobbies are go surfing, watch movies, listen to music and play videogames. I entered the world of cryptocurrencies at the beginning of the past year. I participated in some NFT games, pool platforms, farms and stacking but what interests me the most is trading. Currently, in my free time I try to study more about  the trading theory, although lately I am interested in the functioning of blockchain and its impact on the economy. I found out about Maker through twitter and I was very interested, I knew what DAI was but I hadn\u2019t paid attention to it, I had always used USDT. But now knowing the background of DAI in terms of its creation, operation and acceptance in this environment, it is clear that we are facing the beginning of a great economic revolution. I want to share everything that I learn with you and create a bond where together we can acquire new knowledges, debate and exchange ideas. From what I understand, so I hope to be able to be part of this growth together with all of you. Thank you very much for letting me participate in this community. Greetings! ",

Interests include physics, philosophy, computer science, payments, fintech, and programmable money. Familiar with Maker for a while, but I have been thinking about DeFI and how it could have a transformative effect on the non crypto native world for some time . I have worked in fintech my whole adult career, many years as a developer, then as a business line/industry guy focused on banking and payments. So why am I here, what do I hope to contribute and what do I hope to learn ? Today  I work in a large fintech company that works with a lot of banks - in my particular case, I work with smaller US institutions that are looking for more ways to compete with the megabanks and digital only players, while trying to serve their communities at the same time - mainstreet america. Liquidity is king and its getting tougher given the macro and micro environments \u2013 challenging to say the least. I am engineer by trade, but nowadays I am a business line leader who is thinking about creative ways to help an industry better serve its communities and end customers while helping it compete better against the megabank + nonbank players. What MakerDao has done with HVB is a very interesting template for how DeFI and community banking can work together \u2013 community banks get access to liquidity \u2013 global liquidity \u2013 without impacting the balance sheet. The DAO gets real world yield in exchange. This is, I hope, the beginning of a broader partnership between a great American industry \u2013 community banking -  and a great DeFi platform like Maker. So what do I hope to contribute? A proposition\u2026\u2026I propose the Dao think about diversifying RW yield sources as Shawn noted. Ok so this doesn\u2019t sound very interesting probably because other banks are talking to the Dao. I am saying let us work together to try to achieve \u201cescape velocity\u201d with this RW yield model \u2013 viz., rapid scaling into mainstream finance. Work with me, my interested clients, and my team to help ideate a way to rapidly scale the number of participating banks working with the Dao. One of my product colleagues is talking to the \u201cbusiness development\u201d group in MakerDao, but I came in through Discord \u2013 they told me to find the core units  What do I hope to learn here? Are you guys interested? If so, let\u2019s connect the dots and try to do something cool and potentially industry changing, that touches CeFI, DeFi and TradFI. ",
