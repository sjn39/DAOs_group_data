Making another repo \u2013 with one asset in it \u2013 won\u2019t help. \u201cbloated assets\u201d \u2013 for one file \u2013 is not a problem we have right now. BTW \u2013 I was explaining how we do this at SPADE just as an example. We use HackMD internally heavily so a fit for us. The Ethereum Foundation has notes.ethereum.org and has a \u201cgroup\u201d for us at EthMagicians. Not sure if they have file uploads turned on. MP is the one who has access? Looks like my github account hasn\u2019t been added to the list yet. ",
