How defi is it really with all that central backing. -688,444 annual profits. People consider it wUSDC. The reputation hit is real. 2 Billion Dai that are minted with Eth are superior to 10 Billion Dai that are 90% stablecoin backed. The number 10 billion is absolutely meaningless. Is this real growth or is this cosmetics. Dai will have failed even if it wraps 100 Billion USDC from the perspective of a MKR holder if the annual profit is negative. Does the MKR price go up when Dai numbers go up? Does the market care that Dai wraps more USDC? I dont think anybody cares. ",

The stablecoin backing makes Dai fragile against a regulatory attack. Also USDC Dai does not produce any income at all. Maker should figure out how to make the income producing Dai grow its not about the number of Dai its about the number of Dai that generate income for the protocol. I dont see what the plan is here? Increase Dai liquidity and then suddenly switch on the PSM fees and make it expensive to use the PSM ? If it continues like this it will lead to nowhere. From the point of view of a Dai user I dont have much of a problem with Dai (except the fragility against the US government concerns me) from the point of view of a Maker investor I am not satisfied with the outlook whatsoever. Ofcourse all the early lofty goals of having a crypto native stablecoin that is completly decentralized and autonomous went out of the window long ago. ",

Non Stablecoin lending is market driven and right now risky assets demand is low, not much we can do about it but continue to incentivize vault usage and L1/L2 integrations to open the gates to retail investors. However, lending innovation is required to keep up growth in this segment. Things such us AI lending based on users wallet usage, apps behaviours or other patterns might be needed or at least worth a try to support growth by lowering collateralization requirements while maintaining a high repayment ratio. In terms of revenue, the USDC backing will soon be returning yield back to MKR via off and on chain investments, the path to revenue is clear its just a matter of execution now. ",

Also generating it off chain will be another vulnerability. Because if Dai doesnt fit into the stablecoin framework the US government will put forth they can access the off chain assets anytime and put pressure on all people involved. Maybe it will open some people up to lawsuits. And MKR will be deemed a security. Whos assets will they legally be off chain? Can MakerDao keep legal control? And how is MKR then not a security? It gives voting rights its an investment contract and its vulnerable due to potentially having billions in US bonds. The path Maker is on it will need to comply with everything the US government demands. And its possible the entire business model of having eth collateral is not workable. Someone will have to register with the SEC too. Generating yield off chain with exposure to the US is going to potentially backfire big time. Defi is resilient because it keeps out of the reach of governments. And I honestly dont think Maker can comply with whats coming. I think it might turn out impossible. ",
