                    "content": "There is currently 480 Million Dai being borrowed on Compound.  This has quickly become incredibly dangerous.  I urge everyone to pay attention and coordinate ways we can increase the Dai supply if needed (which is NOW, right NOW).  The pressure building has the potential to blow the whole system apart if we do not allow it an escape.  We need to ensure that Dai can be borrowed more or less without limit.  We can set the interest rates to 500% for these if need be, there just has to be room to create Dai.  There are other things we will need to do too, but right now the #1 priority should be allowing room for Dai supply to grow in the case of an extreme liquidity shortage for Dai the likes of which we have never seen. Please create or expand B type vaults for all collateral types (or at least ETH and USDC) and set the interest rates on those into the hundreds of percent but make their limits massive. The bottom line is this: Think about what would happen right now if for some reason 500 million or a billion Dai was needed or the price would go towards infinity for Dai.  We have no solution currently. The price would just go there because even with people issuing more we hit the debt ceilings and then game over.  We need to act, there has to be room. ",

For example.  If ETH debt ceiling was 140 million for type A, than B\u2019s debt ceiling should be 70 million or more.  This ensures that during a liquidity event that there is always going to be enough Dai available in the short term and that we will have time to react and make changes if needed before we hit issues like we had in March.
