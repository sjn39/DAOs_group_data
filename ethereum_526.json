The Process is aimed to be social and properly incentivized and designed to collect and aggregate comparative knowledge about projects in Ethereum space with focus on interoperability. Even if you have a different focus, may be you are interested to review our Ideas to incentivization because it could be applied to FEM community globally. In the next days we will start a dry run with few contributors. We will walk through the process, verify it and collect feedback. If you would like to be part of it, let me know. ",
