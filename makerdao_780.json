                    "content": "This Signal Request allows the MakerDAO community to signal if it wants PAXG to be onboarded. All the risk assessments have been made in 2020 and it was close to be onboarded in January 2021:  Smart contract Oracle Risk  It was already approved for onboarding by a governance poll (thanks @Patrick_J for finding it). \u2013 Since then, the market cap has increased especially recently due to the Ukrainian situation.  image843\u00d7651 25.1 KB  The liquidity is also better. While the Uni v2 pool is small, it nevertheless has significant volumes showing arbitrage activity.  image1371\u00d7570 82.3 KB  On an hourly basis, you can see that the pool is handling 2M of hourly volume sometimes.  image1031\u00d7375 40 KB  There was $50M volume on Binance those last 24 hours and there was a daily peak at $100M of volume. On the parameters:  Risk proposed DC is 5M. The proposed LR was 125% but @Primoz might set it to 130%. The proposed SF was 4% which is probably too high currently but a new proposal can be managed by the MOMC    Pros  Gold might be an important building block for DeFi. When we onboarded WBTC, it was small and unproven in DeFi, since then it is an important piece, in part thanks to MakerDAO. The same thing can happen with PAXG. DeFi can provide yield for Gold and attract TradFi people This onboarding might increase our relationship with Paxos. US Dollar dominance is under attack (especially after the weaponization of the dollar) and strong inflation is on the menu. Both are good for gold.   Cons  Gold can fall into oblivion soon. The current rates increase are bad for Gold. PAXG is centralized by Paxos Demand can be lacking and we would incur a loss and a defocus (Oracle costs)  This Signal Request is to allow community and MKR holders to signal if they want to move forward with PAXG.    Do you want to onboard PAXG as collateral type in MakerMCD?  Yes, onboard PAXG No, do nothing Abstain     0 voters     The signal will run until 2022-04-04T22:00:00Z (closed during Wednesday), before being put on-chain if the yes option is wining. ",

And you don\u2019t build a financial ecosystem with only stablecoins and startups. The vault facility will provide a way for market makers to repo PAXG to make markets. I hope that improving the DeFi markets for PAXG will showcase the power of DeFi for other traditional markets. Gold ETFs are a $100B market cap so there is room to grow. GLD ETF is charging 40bps and is difficult to be composed with other elements of TradFi (well it\u2019s TradFi). Time to show the power of DeFi. ",

I think this should be a separate topic. On using PAXG as a collateral I vote YES. The debt ceiling seems conservative enough based on the shown liquidity and risks of centralisation. I would be intellectually interest to read a deeper analysis ahead of executive vote. On using PAXG as a potential diversifier of USDC exposure, I would be curious to hear the view of Strategic Finance. I have done some work in the past for the hedge fund I was involved in, predating most recent turmoil. Gold isn\u2019t the best of assets (no risk premium, no positive carry, debatable industrial uses) but back in the day we had allocated 2% to it as part of our diversification of value strategy. I wish we had done the same for BTC. Thanks for bringing this to the community Seb. ",

Exactly how is that fee going to be handled since the last time I did any swapping on Uniswap for PAXG I basically had to pay the fee (at least on one side). My other question here is given Protocol Engineering time seems to be at a premium and added oracle costs are going to be significant whether it even makes sense.  Trying to remember oracle costs per collateral but I think I was hearing 1M/yr/collateral type.   Even at 200bps this means we need to be looking at 50M and I don\u2019t see Maker as capturing 10% of 600M (ambitious to say the least) is only 60M. My take here is between the PAXG fees, the limited collateral available (600M), the oracle fees and PE work Maker needs to be looking more at low hanging fruit.   Example Compound DAI or USDC D3M which itself has the potential to generate 1M or more/yr. ",

As noted above, harsh and uncertain macroeconomic factors have led to a significant increase in demand for Gold. One drawback is that this demand can subside while (hopefully) tensions also subside. Another drawback is an increased reliance on Paxos, but again, at least this is spread through different assets. They have also have safeguards in place, such as on-chain attestations of their reserves that we can monitor. In any case, I would like to see MakerDAO become one of the premiere protocols offering access tokenized Gold. PAXG has only improved since the last time this already passed, so let\u2019s push it through! ",

I share these concerns:     Doo_StableLab:  Unless there\u2019s a clear proposal to scale up the Maker ecosystem (or closer collaboration from Paxos team), this will result in another collateral that has higher cost just from gas fee for operating Oracle than potential stability fee from it.   I also would like to see the terms and conditions for PAXG that describe where the gold is stored, under what terms with what counterparties, and in what jurisdiction. How does the market verify where title to this gold is held and that it does not have multiple claims? If you can point me to where this information can be found on their website or elsewhere that would be great, thank you! As a personal aside, I find the idea that gold is great for DeFi to be hilariously ironic and false. I\u2019m assuming a tokenized gold product functions or trades like a cash-settled futures contract (?), but do admit I am not yet familiar with this particular instrument. In any case, all that we are trying to innovate away from in DeFi is brought right back to center with onboarding a precious metal/commodity-backed token as collateral. We face the worst of Counterparty Risk, Credit Risk, Legal Risk, Political Risk and lack of any transparent mechanism to verify absolutely the ability to foreclose on a contractual claim to gold allegedly held in a vault somewhere. What are the proofs of the authenticity and provenance of said gold? Market confidence in the representational value of such a product is too easily destroyed for this to be an attractive collateral type in my view. For the above concerns at this time, I voted no. ",

For our community Due Diligence purposes we should also have (or have access to view) copies of contracts and counterparty agreements that confirm and detail the third party commercial arrangements as described in the initial proposal (brought forward to the current date). Legal Opinions - Regulatory Compliance, Authority and Capacity @MarianoDP I would like to review the UK and US legal opinions referred to in Daniel Burstein, Paxos General Counsel\u2019s letter to the community dated May 27, 2020 (linked in the post copied below), which states that the opinions can only be shared to individuals who agree to certain confidentiality terms. I am happy to request as instructed in the letter, but want to coordinate through your team and otherwise ask everyone how we should best get eyes on the actual opinions and report back to the group.    [PAXG] - PAX Gold MIP6 collateral application Collateral Onboarding Applications (MIP6)       Hey everyone,  It\u2019s Ilan from Paxos. Our legal and compliance team has put together an official response to the MIP questions 10 & 11 which you\u2019ll find attached.  As far as fees go, we unfortunately cannot reduce or waive them. Unlike stablecoins (PAX, BUSD, USDC, etc) that generate interest from the underlying USD, PAX Gold has an inherent cost (vault fees) from storing the underlying physical gold. Other gold tokens charge a demurrage fee to the token holders over time to offset these costs, b\u2026     Questions on Force Majeure, Disruption Events and other information previously requested: Given the physical nature of the gold markets and structure backing PAXG, we need to carefully verify marketing descriptions and also understand the interpretation of fine print. For example, Force Majeure is defined to include such broadly described and regularly occurring events as \u201ccryptoasset market collapse or fluctuations.\u201d Force Majeure provisions in commodities trading markets are among the most important terms to negotiate because they allow a party to walk away from their obligations without penalty if an event outside of their control occurs. Often there are liquidated damages provisions the parties negotiate to re-allocate the economic impact of these risks when contracts are bi-lateral. Force Majeure events are meant to be in the \u201cAct of God\u201d kind of space where it\u2019s truly impossible for a party to have prevented or anticipated the event. Here\u2019s a nice short article by the law firm Reed Smith on the topic.  Are we comfortable with the latitude Paxos has to be excused from performance in the event of market disruptions or the failure of their counterparties? What happens if the INTL FCStone price feed is discontinued by StoneX or their calculation methodology is changed in an unacceptable manner? What fall back provisions have been specified in Paxos\u2019 agreements with their counterparties and what business interruption contingencies are in place for various scenarios to avoid certain Force Majeure events from being easily triggered?  Needless to say the possibility of \u201cwar\u201d \u201cpandemic\u201d or \u201chacking\u201d being raised as an excuse for performance is not far fetched. How might sanctions/AML/KYC requirements limit the ability of a party to convert PAXG to gold? From the Paxos website General Terms and Conditions updated March 1 2022         > 12.2. Force Majeure   Neither we (nor any bank where our deposit accounts are held) will be liable for our failure to perform any obligations under this Agreement due to events beyond our control, and the time provided for performing such obligations shall be extended by a period of time equal to the duration of such events. Events beyond our control include, but are not limited to, acts of God, war, riot, arson, embargoes, civil commotion, strikes, labor disputes, equipment failures, bank failures, crypto asset market collapse or fluctuations, fiat currency conversion rate fluctuations, fire, flood, earthquake, hurricanes, tropical storms or other natural disaster or casualty, shortages of labor or material, shortage of transportation, facilities, fuel, energy, pandemic, government regulation or restriction, acts of civil or military authority or terrorism, fiber cuts, weather conditions, breaches or failures to perform by third parties, technical problems, including hardware and software crashes and other malfunctions, failure of the telecommunications or information services infrastructure, hacking, SPAM or failure of any computer, server or software disruptions on account of or caused by vandalism, theft, phone service outages, power outage, Internet disruptions, viruses, and mechanical, power or communications failures.

Have detail answers to this post been provided to date?    [PAXG] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation Domain Work       I saw that the onboarding of PAXG was delayed due to \u2018technical reasons\u2019.  Is this related to all the transparency issues around the supply of PAXG and the gold that is supposed to back it?  They are apparently minting huge sums more tokens than they have gold backing as indicated by any available data source. Archive in case it\u2019s deleted again.  Has Paxos every provided or committed to provide complete bar level transparency data?  Summary of the issues:    Their Chainlink gold reserve data fee\u2026   And as further requested here:    [PAXG] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation   Also I don\u2019t think your response fully answeres the queries of @ffrenchman. There are similar questions on Reddit too about the issues he raised. Would you mind answering them point by point?   ",

The PSM was, and is, seen as a valuable mechanism for them to increase awareness and usage in DeFi. In exchange for our help they would integrate DAI on Paxos api\u2019s and infrastructure, where their customers like PayPal or Revolut could enable DAI on their rails. Here you can read the details on this post by a Paxos member Create a PAX PSM The offered timeline for DAI integration on Paxos was by the end of last year or by Q1. We have recently learned that DAI is not prioritized for integration and it could be at the end of this year that DAI is integrated. The reason has been explained as the need to prioritize other assets that their customers are requesting in addition to being more conservative in listing tokens in general based on their regulatory status. Regarding PAXG, there isn\u2019t a way for Paxos to turn off the transfer fee so Maker would have to support a wrapped version of this to work as collateral. Demand for PAXG is less from institutions and more (at least currently) from crypto native traders. That all said, I personally don\u2019t see the justification for adding PAXG as collateral given the additional technical hurdle of wrapping while other collaterals might be more cost effective and productive, long term, for the protocol. Additionally, it seems unbalanced to provide Paxos with more functionality within the Makers ecosystem when we have yet to get that in return. ",

                    "content": "@Jenn 's comments are well taken. I learned a bit about this quid pro quo, or lack thereof, from other Maker folk at the HBS conference this past weekend. We ought to not to reward a counter-party after they renege. Sets a poor precedent. Whether PAXG is pursued or not, the question of whether and how to onboard synths as eligible collateral will certainly re-emerge. And probably sooner than we think.  I can only imagine the TVL Maker could get if folks across the world could lock Tokenized shares of Apple as a collateral type  For sure there are other platforms working on getting Token Securities onboarded, but its being quite the long-road as it has yet to gain much traction  Synths are important mainly because they have an enormous TAM and drive financial inclusion. As long as the market believes in the legitimacy of the oracle informing the price (ideally a network of reporting nodes where the minority inputs are carved off and slashed) and the collateral against which the synth is minted, synths give people all over the world permission-less access to previously inaccessible financial assets. Folks in Yakutsk, Abuja, or Istanbul would be able to access US and European fixed income and equities, commodities, and alternative investments. To @flipflopflapdelegate 's point, someone will be clever enough or dumb enough to roll this out this infrastructure en masse and benefit accordingly. Mirror, FTX, Synthetix, and ThorChain are off to the races. It is my understanding that the slow speed of deployment is due primarily to regulatory concern, as opposed to any technical hurdle or lack of user appetite. With that said, Mirror has had trouble gaining traction I believe. FTX has earned the right to be bold because they\u2019ve smartly courted regulators. A synth is certainly a security if the spot asset it mirrors is a security (e.g. equity). Or if the futures or options contract it is functionally replacing is considered a primary or secondary security. I think the more interesting discussion lies not in synthetics but in a new class of spot, or genuines. These are newly formed assets that track real world activity but that live on crypto rails. Two examples could be what Regen Network is doing to create new classes of ecological assets (water purification vs. reforesting vs. carbon credits) and creating a local real estate index based on some bespoke oracle. This would allow people to invest in a neighborhood without owning property or taking concentration in a single asset. Note: RWF is thinking about how we might weave greening incentives into vault terms to counter-parties. If an on-chain ecological ledgering system, for example, allowed borrowers to demonstrate, via cryptographic guarantees, that they\u2019d made an impact, the MakerDAO community could algorithmically or manually adjust said borrower\u2019s cost of capital, DC, etc. MakerDAO could preferentially allocate capital to impact agents, not just in the production of new loans but in the modification of outstanding ones.  Is RWF looking at commodity tokenization generally or planning to?  This is not something we\u2019ve spoken about, at least not since I\u2019ve joined. We\u2019d be open to thoughts on which specific commodities should be considered for further research. Maybe since we cannot reasonably add long-term nuclear facility construction debt to the balance sheet, we ought to at least take advantage of the Uranium scarcity\u2026These things are tricky though. Even \u201cinnocuous\u201d or green commodities like lithium, nickel, and cobalt have their own concerns vis a vis humane treatment of workers and the rest. But no reason MakerDAO cannot do what it does best: have a reasonable and measured discussion and build a framework accordingly. I think we will invariably have revisit this subject, as a DAO, when a more existential discussion around what DAI should really be pegged to arises. If inflation is measured in purchasing power against stuff, then in the limit you want your currency to be tied to the stuff that people want and need. USD may soon become our largest liability. ",
