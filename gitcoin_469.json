I created a profile here at gitcoin a while back when donating to a few projects. I just found today a message in an e-mail account, one of my less active of nine, that averages about 26,000 incoming emails each month, that informed me of gitcoins afforded me due to prior donations and participation. I realize that prevailing wisdom determined a clawback was the appropriate action for any that did not have gitcoin\u2019s token allocation as a top-priority during their pre-set allotted determination  window, but am wondering what the parameters were for deciding the variables and factors of influence? Clearly reasonable people such as those one might expect to exhibit that of gitcoin\u2019s community, determined their method according to sound logic and mathematics. Would you please pass along your equation? If anyone believes this post in poor taste, please e-mail y000ul0se@gmail.com to initiate a dialogue. I assure you that  I did not highlight your tacky and \u201cnew monied\u201d approach to whatever your pet name is for your pseudo-coin giveaway, with built in pre-set clawback mechanism (y\u2019all should really market that), to stir the pot. Rather, to either to reveal how cheap and void of any meaningful proclivity towards goodwill that the gitcoin community is, or how fragile their ego\u2019s are, if the case was that the allotted time was all fragile ego\u2019s could handle having not been noticed, when offering such a kind gesture. Either way, not good looks. I\u2019m glad you have mine, otherwise I would have to spend the gas sending them back to y\u2019all. The only other project that was similarly ego driven and tacky to this extent was that of Badger Dao, and though they have bounced back due to potential roi. I myself bought and profited\u2026 they will of course fall again. Don\u2019t choose a similar path. ",
