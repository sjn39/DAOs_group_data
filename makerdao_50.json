Summary The month was mainly focused on working on the New Silver contracts (those are almost the same for every Centrifuge assets). We are continuing to work on this front but nothing seems to prevent the launch of the New Silver facility. Bigger vaults will require better solutions and we are working on that. From a technological point of view, we will soon have MIP21 and MIP22 implemented. That will give enough technological tools for real-world assets in the short/medium term without putting too much load on Smart Contract teams. We have opened a discussion regarding long term loans because we think it is best for some RWA. This will be a key concept for Maker in the future as we saw the proposal of MIP43: Term Lending Module (crypto-loans related). This has plenty of unknown implications regarding liquidity, interest risk and DAI demand tability. More work is needed on this front. The good news is that traditional finance has worked those subjects a lot.  Collateral onboarding  image891\u00d7149 9.15 KB  Besides those collaterals, we have a lot of incoming demand and a lot of talks with prospects. It is our understanding that it\u2019s better to have already discussed possible terms before the MIP6 application.

While the long-term strategy is to simply invest in senior tranches of structured products rated by credit rating agencies, we recognize that it\u2019s not currently possible in DeFi. We have a two-path approach. First, partnering with Centrifuge, we work on a smart-contract way of investing in structured finance. Second, we are investigating a Trust-based way to invest the MakerDAO balance sheet in the real world using real-world tools. We also think that having a strong capital base (i.e. surplus buffer) will be important to disrupt the traditional finance world. As we recognize that people prefer to burn MKR while it\u2019s seeing as cheap, we also work to inform the market and the community on the financial strength of MakerDAO. We think that if the market recognizes the financial prospects of MakerDAO, the MKR price will increase, giving more opportunities to consolidate the capital base. Such knowledge will also help Maker Governance make more scientific decisions.

We actually already have a backlog of structures which combined have a nominal value in exposure of more than 500M.

                    "content": "March 2021 reporting for Real-World Finance Core Unit .  Review  MIP22/New-silver onboarding progress We have a weekly 2-hours slot with Smart Contract team and Centrifuge to move forward on MIP22. Thanks to the work done by everyone, New Silver is now on Kovan. MIP22 was transformed to use MIP21. We have a final due diligence meeting with New Silver next Tuesday. They have already $3M of assets and are financing 10 loans. More information will be shared next week. No need to say how exciting it is. The first RWA investment by MakerDAO can happen in April.  Others collaterals There is still a lot of action on other collaterals. Here is just a sample of some. Consol Freight might follow soon New Silver (after checking that everything works and a bit of Lindy effect). Harbor Trade Credit risk assessment should be published in April. We had some calls with SolarX and some back-and-forth with them. It follows the trust model and we hope to onboard this one in June. Many parties are involved (landowners, equity investors, utilities) which might require strong coordination on this one. Discussions with People\u2019s Company are in progress to find the best way to structure the deal. Finally, good progress on FortunaFi which is a great opportunity to diversify. Here is the full list of what is worked on and public.  image860\u00d7210 9.74 KB  We will work on a timeline for RWA onboarding. Internally first, then see how it could be incorporated by others teams and the Collateral Onboarding Sheet.  Legal We have found a law firm that will be able to help us analyze legal structures. Their knowledge will be helpful when we will analyze the trust model legal documents. Additionally, for the SPV models, we had a discussion with an SPV manager that can provide independent directors services to harden security while staying cost-effective. This increases the bankruptcy remoteness of the SPV. The independent manager will also search for a backup service should the original asset originator default. This will be mandatory for any sizable investment (meaning above a few million DAI).  Research - Crypto banking 101 This paper presents our findings on how the banking framework applies to crypto.  More precisely, it draws a link between our solvency (surplus buffer) and the deposit interest rate we might need to have (DSR).  Budget dashboard There is now a budget dashboard so you can see the link between core unit expenses, the impact on the Surplus Buffer, and MKR dilution. The MKR framework working group will provide input to have something more precise but while waiting you can make simulations. @Aes stepped up to continue working on this topic. Exciting to see that we have experts in all fields in the community.  Data infrastructure Coming from a data science background (and setting up data infrastructures) I put high importance on having a good data environment. For instance, in the current financials presentation I make use of Dune Analytics, but maintaining queries are painful, not scalable, and limited (it\u2019s a great tool, but not ideal to be the data warehouse of a $3B market cap organization). It takes me hours of error-prone copy-pasting for something that should be one refresh click on Excel. On another topic, one important question is how many DAI withdrawals can we get if farming activities are stopping. How much of the DAI usage is non-speculative? We spent the month discussing with a lot of possible providers. There are actually way more solutions than I was expecting but the space is still super early. There is also plenty of question on what do we want to achieve. For instance, we might want to have ownership to not depend on third parties that can break your work or disappear. Obviously, if we want something good, there will be a cost. In summary, super early, but very good discussions. If this is an area that interests you, or if you plan to submit a Data Core Unit, feel free to reach out. My goal is to have something to show for the end of the year.

As we discussed in the rocket.chat and also privately, I am also confused by your take (also of your Crypto Banking 101. This paper describes the business of\u2026 | by S\u00e9bastien Derivaux | Mar, 2021 | Medium) that MakerDAO is a fractional reserve based on USD (and it\u2019s n-th layer derivatives like USDC). On the one hand in your crypto-banking-101 you say that MakerDAO\u2019s reserves are 22% (USDC in the PSM) but at the same time:     SebVentures:  Actually, if USDC goes bust, DAI is in a very bad situation, the opposite is not true.   It seems we are in a paradox here, because if we had (or we go back to) 0% in PSM-USDC, we would be not exposed anymore to this risk. A source of confusion for me is:     SebVentures:  Not insolvent but lacking liquidity. Actually, we don\u2019t make any promise on DAI besides ES.   Usual banks borrow (from customers, from other banks, etc). We don\u2019t. We lend and we print DAI. So I am (naively) tempted to agree with what @g_dip said. Some vague questions:   What about MakerDAO in its SCD version (just ETH)? It still had most characteristics of today\u2019s MCD, but had 0% in USDC derivates and 100% in ETH (a layer-1 asset).   Was SCD a fractional reserve with 0% reserves, in your point of view?   Why people perceived DAI as a good alternative to USDT then? They had somewhat faith in our \u2018reserves\u2019.   One important point, that @SebVentures made me appreciate and that I repeat here in case it\u2019s useful to somebody else is: It is wrong to say that MakerDAO has crypto reserves (ETH, WBTC, etc). The reserves of MakerDAO are of two types:  Loans (all the crypto vaults). Some assets (mostly USDC in PSM) \u2192 a recent addition (Nov 2020).  For (1), the loans are a good reserve as long as they are safe. And their safety is obtained through the col. ratio, and all the parameters evaluated by the risks teams. For (2), the assets, they are good as long as they keep (or in fact, increase) their value vs DAI (=vs USD). Finally,     SebVentures:  Like any bank. They are currently limited by regulation but that wasn\u2019t always the case.   If this is your point of view (MakerDAO is just a bank like any other, just not regulated), should we expect regulation to come to MakerDAO (like Basel iii ?) ",

It was fine to hit 1B DAI. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good value proposition to hit 100B DAI. Regarding the USDC. It is a risk, but it is also a feature. As long as there is 22% PSM-USDC backing you know that one DAI can be quite easily converted to cash. At the same, if you fear for USDC safety, DAI is a better solution as you would lose less by holding DAI than USDC.     iammeeoh:  What about MakerDAO in its SCD version (just ETH)?

Why people perceived DAI as a good alternative to USDT then? They had somewhat faith in our \u2018reserves\u2019.   It was a pure synthetic asset (fractional with 0% is correct, but probably not the best wording). And that was fine for the time. I mean when you compete with USDT being shady as hell \u2026 Transparency is one of our best features. No fiat-backed stablecoin is transparent currently. But when they will \u2026 Now we can also say that DAI is better because it is more censorship and regulatory proof. Nexo and BlockFi need to pay 10% interest to have deposits and do crypto-loans (almost like MakerDAO). But they are not transparent at all and you can\u2019t do much with their bank deposit. But that will change. Let\u2019s say Nexo becomes a public company where everyone can see the balance sheet and the size of the surplus buffer. They tokenize the USD deposits to create NexoUSD that yields 10% (let\u2019s say by increasing the amount of token, not the price that is always $1) and can be redeemed at any time for USDC/BUSD/PAX/GUSD because they have a partnership and they keep $-reserves (like the PSM in a way). And you can have exactly the same model for Aave. Now let\u2019s say Stripe/Visa has a payment system where you can use any safe-enough stablecoin for stuff for $1 no slippage. Do you keep USDC, DAI/CHAI, NexoUSD or aUSD in your wallet? And what if your stablecoin is not good enough to participate in this clearinghouse system? This is the war of 2022 (or maybe more 2025). We have a headstart but we need to stay on top. TL;DR: the spread between SF and DSR will fall except if we are super good. ",

Banks source deposits ex post facto to meet the capital requirements outlined by the central bank and regulators. These requirements exist, at least allegedly, because the banks are printing dollars that are considered fungible within the Federal Reserve\u2019s payment network. If they did not want this privilege of printing money that can be used in the Fed\u2019s network, at least in theory they would not need depositors at all. Rather, they would source holders of their notes in order to ensure that they don\u2019t suffer from inflation versus whichever benchmark they are targeting (like Dai with the USD). I\u2019m aware the outcome is semantic, but the difference in concept is important. This is why it doesn\u2019t make sense to say that Dai has \u201creserves\u201d of any sort. Reserves for what? If you\u2019re saying that it\u2019s for liquidity, I think you\u2019ve taken the opposite perspective of what\u2019s actually happening. The Protocol purchases USDC because users need Dai liquidity, not the other way around. I\u2019m afraid I just don\u2019t understand the premise of Dai being \u201cthird tier\u201d money as this assumes we seek fungibility with Federal Reserve Notes. We seek stability versus these notes, not acceptance  as fungible within their payment network. I\u2019d argue the counter, that being outside of the legacy banking system is our core competitive advantage, and we should seek to sever ties with existing banks (USDC) as soon as possible in favor of real world assets pledged directly by borrowers.

If you\u2019re saying that it\u2019s for liquidity, I think you\u2019ve taken the opposite perspective of what\u2019s actually happening. The Protocol purchases USDC because users need Dai liquidity, not the other way around.   This is what I see. Especially as collateral continues to be diversified, any dramatic collapse in DAI\u2019s peg to the downside would be hard to hedge against anyways. Either the dollar collapsed \u2014 not strictly a problem for DAI\u2019s mission of stability vs the dollar as long as liquidity remains in the system \u2014 or so many different assets collapsed at once that there\u2019s not much you could have done without the ability to engage in hedging. You can think of DAI like a worldwide pawn shop \u2014 it provides liquidity rather than soaking it up. In a crisis, you actually want to be that provider. See 12 months ago as reference. As DAI becomes bigger, that upside relative to the dollar should become less pronounced. You can already see the smoothing of price fluctuations for DAI as it has grown since last summer. ",

The definition works fine for free banking experiments outside of central banks and regulators. You can have money first or credit first, it doesn\u2019t change anything really.   The deposit is created simultaneous to the loan. If you come to \u201cGreg\u2019s bank\u201d and borrow $1,000, the $1000 I print for you becomes the deposit. Monitoring a capital ratio (hopefully we are using the word the same, I am saying that we\u2019d monitor this ratio to ensure Dai is always sufficiently collateralized) does not require maintaining reserves. This is the core premise of your argument that I\u2019m disagreeing with. Dai is not a eurodollar because it does not (and should not) promise its holders USD on demand, nor does it treat any kind of liquidity obligation as a measure of its solvency. You would surely admit that a foreign bank is insolvent if they cannot provide their depositors USD on demand in a dollar-denominated checking account. This is clearly not the case for Dai. The only promise that Dai makes is that there\u2019s always >$1 of collateral for every 1 Dai.     SebVentures:  Not sure what is the difference here. USDC is not fungible with Fed reserves. But we want high stability. Not eventual stability.   USDC is fungible with commercial bank deposits which are practically fungible with Federal Reserve Notes (so long as the bank is in the Fed\u2019s network and of a certain size). Banks have historically used reserves to ensure that there\u2019s enough liquidity to give the illusion of fungibility in what is technically a non-fungible asset, but the changes in policy made since '08 have made this requirement all but obsolete. In practice the Fed will never allow a TBTF bank to have \u201cinsufficient reserves\u201d to meet their obligations and will buy their assets to \u201cprovide liquidity\u201d (enforce fungibility where there should not be fungibility). The tradeoff of this \u201ctotal solvency\u201d being \u201ctotal subordination.\u201d The key difference between this system and ours is that a bank will fail if it cannot deliver Fed Notes to its depositors when they are demanded, MakerDAO will not fail as it has no obligation to deliver USDC, or any asset, to Dai holders. This is why it does not make sense to say that the USDC in the Protocol are reserves. It is just an asset on the balance sheet. To make this kind of promise would implicitly subordinate Dai to USDC. The concept of maintaining reserves is only relevant if you (as a subordinated institution) are trying to meet an obligation to deliver base money, or in the case of USDC commercial bank money, to the holders of your liabilities. This is not a relevant comparison for Dai because it is base money. Sure we want ample liquidity with fiat currency, but we cannot commit to fungibility, or at least any level of liquidity that mimics fungibility, without subordinating ourselves to the legacy system (like USDC). To illustrate this point with an example, you wouldn\u2019t call US Treasuries purchased by the Fed \u201creserves\u201d when they use open market operations to maintain the price level of the US dollar. The same applies to the Protocol purchasing USDC. The Protocol can\u2019t have reserves for the same reason the Fed itself can\u2019t have reserves, because both create base money in their respective ecosystem. Neither entity can default on its obligations because it has not promised depositors anything for holding its liability. These are just assets on the balance sheet. Dai holders may have recourse to the balance sheet through an ES, but this is up to MKR holders and is not done at the demand of Dai holders - the same way that the Fed does not owe holders of Fed Notes access to its collection of US Treasuries. This might be easier to conceptualize if you imagine that Dai was pegged to CPI instead of the USD - what would the reserves be in this situation?     SebVentures:  Reducing USDC exposure is important. But cutting the link to the US Dollar system will lead to instability due to the absence of risk-free arbitrage (of last resort if you want). MakerDAO should own tradable liquid assets, not only DAI loans to manage DAI price.   I fully agree with this an think we\u2019re saying the same thing. I am saying that we should sever our reliance on bank liabilities and try to source productive assets from the legacy system (the same assets banks are competing for in order to generate their own liabilities). I don\u2019t care if the assets are readily tradable/liquid so long as this risk is correctly priced. ",

Review February was an insane month in terms of new prospects for RWA. @Philinje took most of the customer relationship. A significant Real-World Asset documentation was published with more precise definitions and formulas and a link to our Collateral Monitoring template.  1178\u00d7483 12.5 KB . @williamr as written a nice Asset Originator onboarding document with a checklist. I hope we can achieve the timeline   1386\u00d7721 123 KB  We improved our Risk Assessment template thanks to the feedbacks from the community. A lot of work has been done on how to secure and scale securitization investments through SPVs (e.g. the Centrifuge Model). One part is a discussion with asset managers (instead of asset originators) and the second part is third parties with reputable credentials and regulatory obligations to monitor/backup the SPV operations.  Collateral onboarding  image804\u00d7209 9.28 KB  Our main priority is still to onboard 6S and NewSilver. For 6s, the SC team published MIP21 in Kovan last week. So the bottleneck is the legal side as @mrabino1 explained well. Then the review might take some time. The Real-World Finance team will probably stop everything to focus on that when it\u2019s ready. For New Silver, the SC team has started to work on MIP22. With MIP21 out of the way they go into the meaty piece. Nevertheless, Liquidation 2.0 remains the priority. There will be a weekly point with @hexonaut. New Silver pool has already $1.5M AUM  and 5 investments. The deal flow is here waiting for Maker. Work is done on documentation review on ConsolFreight by @williamr, you can expect something on the forum in the few weeks. Besides those collaterals, we have a lot of incoming demand and a lot of talks with prospects. It is our understanding that it\u2019s better to have already discussed possible terms before the MIP6 application. The Business Development was great to provide a good deal flow. Nevertheless, it seems more and more obvious that not all collateral will be onboarded. This poses the problem of selection.  Financials The monthly financial presentation was improved with some slides.  image913\u00d7556 62.1 KB  The balance sheet extraction is quite advanced except for getting DAI outstanding. Work has also been done on workforce expenses tracking. Technologically, we are still using Dune Analytics but there are some shortcomings. First, the SQL query is 348 lines of SQL long which is not ideal. Secondly, we can\u2019t have data on the DSR because the platform doesn\u2019t support functions without parameters (like drip). We are evaluating DappQuery as well and a Maker Foundation GraphQL feed but this is not a high priority work. Significant investments will have to be made at some point later this year. Another point of concern is tracking the MakerDAO expenses. It\u2019s already a bit complex and complexity will only increase with the number of MakerDAO wallets and types of expenses.

Review  State of RWA at MakerDAO August was a very active month for RWA at MakerDAO. 4 new collateral have been fully onboarded:  6S vault (RWA001) has now a 15M DC ConsolFreight (RWA003) has been created a 2M DC HarborTrade Credit (RWA004) has been created a 7M DC FortunaFi (RWA005) has been created with a 15M DC  Peoples Company (RWA006) has been added but with a 0M DC. Legal documentation is only begining. New Silver is still the only one RWA with significant exposure on MakerDAO and continue to grow steadily.  2021-08-rwa875\u00d7347 16.7 KB   RWA Pipeline Solar X was approuved by Governance. Constitution of the lender-side of the deal (the Cayman Foundation) has started (KYC for the 3 service providers: secretary, director and supervisor). As soon as this is done a Delaware LLC subsidiary will be created in order to process create/perform KYC for the loan servicer, the escrow account and the broker account. Loan documentation will then be completed. The Foundation will start with simple articles of association while we are setting up everything before switching to the MIP58 version. The pipeline remains strong and challenging to process. @williamr is taking care of the Centrifuge MIP6s while @philinje is managing Reinno and 120dB. The on-chain securitization roadmap was published following the audit by Shearman & Sterling. Work has started on Centrifuge and New Silver side. @christiancdpetersen continued the discussion on legal structures with a comparison. We published MIP58 -RWA Foundations a MIP defining the RWA Cayman Foundation structure and how MakerDAO can interact with such structures.  Finance @Aes has published a roadmap and a call for feedback for Financial Planning & Analysis. He also posted an economic analysis of the institutional vaults highlighting the significant opportunity cost.  Data infrastructure As RWA is taking too much focus, we put the data front in sleep mode. This will delay RWA analytics improvements. There is also a Data Core Unit being incubated.  Team We started a partnership with JST Capital. This is a first move to get channel with institutions interested in investing in on-chain securitization. @luca_pro started an audit on FortunaFi on a project basis. Author of the Dirt Roads newsletter, he is an ex-Morgan Stanley and spent years on illiquid assets and alternative investment. We are actively looking for a securitization talent to join the team on a full-time basis. More new on that in September. @Aes will join the team full-time this month.

Review  State of RWA at MakerDAO New Silver is still the only RWA on MakerDAO and continues to grow steadily.  2021-06-rwa756\u00d7387 15.7 KB  You can read the Post-mortem - New Silver - Executive summary change that details the issue we faced when New Silver changed the executive summary. We have improved significantly the process going forward. New Silver will ask for a Debt Ceiling increase to increase exposure.  RWA Pipeline All 4 Centrifuge-based RWA proposed to MakerDAO Governance were accepted but some Tinlake (following an audit) and legal (see the New Silver postmortem) improvements delayed the deployment. They should be onboarded in July (with the possible exclusion of Peoples Company SPV which is not live yet). 6S is still waiting on administrative finalization. For SolarX, the risk assessment is delayed as we are discussing with them to improve MakerDAO safety by having more collateral at the beginning. It is our understanding that the community doesn\u2019t want to take early project risks without having collateral. The pipeline remains strong and we meet with plenty of prospects around the globe. We have started to work more closely with a major bank to refinance a native blockchain bond (MIP6 expected in July but no promise).  Finance @Aes worked on a MKR compensation financial model to see what are the impacts of MKR distribution using a bear, base, and bull scenario. @LongForWisdom and @Aes then proposed alternative MKR compensation guidelines. The new budget proposal for RWF (MIP40c3-SP12) was approved by MakerDAO Governance. That will give us the ability to expense for legal work and increase the team size to have more throughput. Going forward, the focus will most likely be on forecasting the financials to give an overview of the impact of Core Units on the profitability of MakerDAO especially regarding the low rate environment we can expect going forward.  Legal We have achieved to onboard three legal firms. Those firms are hired by the legal entity of the RWF Facilitator and not the DAO (which doesn\u2019t exist legally speaking). They are (in the order of engagement):   Ogier: Specialized in Cayman Island law. Great reputation in the Trust space.  Latham & Watkins: One of the most reputable law firms internationally.  Shearman & Sterling: Wrote an excellent guide on securitization.  While the first two are working on refining the Trust model, Shearman & Sterling will audit the New Silver (and all Centrifuge based collaterals) structure and most likely will suggest ideas to improve on-chain securitization of RWA.

It gave us exposure to a non-crypto audience.  image1365\u00d7555 138 KB  @williamr was the guest on the first Ask makerDAO Anything, you can find the replay here.   Data infrastructure The first brick of the new RWF data infrastructure is there. We have created some tooling and set up a PostgreSQL database. Since the beginning of the year, we are using a mix of Dune Analytics dashboard and Google Spreadsheet which limits us in things we can do (mixing on-chain and off-chain data like RWA) and doesn\u2019t scale well in complexity (a lot of error-prone copy/paste). Like most RWF projects, evolution will be iterative. The first step will be to port all queries we have under Dune Analytics to the new framework. As you can see below, porting the first query was quite easy (<10 minutes) and is now available in Excel (or any SQL compliant front-end).  2021-06-bi1093\u00d7713 50.7 KB  Moreover, everything is open source and RWF is happy to give access to the database to any CU that needs it or help them set up their own (cost is quite low < $500 / monthly).

                    "content": "Hello SebVentures, Reinno is not investing in seasoned loans. Reinno is a tokenized real estate loan originator. What Viktor mentioned was that Reinno is tokenizing and giving loans to low-risk, income-producing commercial real estate. For the last 3 years we have been working on building tokenized lending solutions that could be integrated on-chain with MKR and other DEFI protocols, but most importantly is solving the price discovery problem based on automated valuations. Those data-driven valuations are taking into consideration multiple data points like electricity usage to calculate occupancy, crime rate, delinquency of tenants in the neighborhood, proximity to schools, restaurants etc., cashflow, avg price per sq.f. in the area etc. in order to have accurate ongoing price discovery. We believe that what we have built is gonna help to bridge the real-world assets and DEFI in a more scientific, fully automated way and we are open to help if our help is wanted. We understand the current status and the complications involved in onboarding real-world assets. We also understand that on-chain integration is the next step in the process. That is why we\u2019ve put a lot of effort, resources and energy in order to help with the Trust structure. I was under the impression that it\u2019s in the common interest for Reinno to be onboarded and start providing tokenized commercial real estate loans. We prepared the legal setup and the collateral agent for less than a month and have already provided everything for review. Up to this point, there\u2019s no feedback. Can we do something to speed up the discussion on it? That will be useful for other companies as well since, as already shared, the legal structure is free to be used by any company. What about the legal setup on MKR side? When will the Cayman Foundation be ready? Or if there is another solution in discussion - could you provide some feedback and / or whom could we get updates from? Another topic where we\u2019re pending feedback is the risk assessment. Reinno\u2019s MIP6 greenlight was 5 months ago. Yet, is there any issue with our risk assessment application or is it the normal process taking that long? In order to improve the communication, I\u2019d suggest having a document with those (and if there are other) tasks with some status updates. Wouldn\u2019t that help in updating us and the community on the progress? Best Regards, Kris ",

You can probably use 6S structure if you think it\u2019s better. I would advise to sync with @Philinje . But again, without the legal structure set, we are kind of blocked.

You, therefore, had plenty of time to express your concerns which didn\u2019t convince enough MKR holders so far. Moreover, your citation doesn\u2019t relate to Centrifuge (other than saying that the first one was harder than the next 4). Therefore, I don\u2019t get what point you are making.     g_dip:  I think my confusion is around why the RWF team is focusing on building legal structures, rather than analyzing the risk of legal structures brought to them by applicants?   Mainly to get things done. We are legal structure agnostic and the creation of legal structures wasn\u2019t expected at the beginning (and no legal structuring matter generally). Yet you have projects coming to MakerDAO to onboard assets and they want to take a loan. I think we told anyone to just copy/paste 6S structure when ready. Some proposed alternatives (Wyoming DAO for instance) or wanted to go through a tokenization path. On the latter, we advised that smart contract time on our end is extremely thin. We highlighted some concerns about the 6S structure. I understand a legal opinion will be provided that will address all possible concerns. Until then, the best option is to move forward and implement what experts are telling us to do. Then, people coming to us with collateral but no legal structure can use it.     g_dip:  Is the plan to put all RWA deals through one Cayman entity?   Probably not. I would say that having structures in many countries is better. But undecided on having clones in the same country. ",

I do understand that @Philinje was busy, but the lack of clarity and timeline is what bothers me. We do not mind using Centrifuge or 6S model but 6s is not ready and is a bit complicated. Regarding Centrifuge, my concern was that the junior debt could be a bottleneck for future scale, but I might be wrong and we could check it out again. We are all part of this community because we have a common goal to make the financial system fairer, accessible, transparent, and much more efficient. We are not considering ourselves just as AO, we want to support this common goal. That means that I want to see more open communication btw RWF and AO and a clear timeline regarding the onboarding process. Accept it as constructive feedback, as I understand that things are far from perfect at this stage which is normal. ",

Moreover, we want to have some diversity as well in terms of structures. On the timeline, I don\u2019t like to commit when I don\u2019t have the answer. Everyone is always super optimistic. I never created a DAO-guided Cayman Foundation before. But we are getting closer and maybe I can update more often. We are at the third iteration of the Articles of Associations for the Cayman Foundation which seems to be the solution. We have a MIP in the work for DAO <-> Cayman Foundation communication (and overall description). This should be posted early August if we settle on the structure. Then community can then take all the time they want to discuss/amend it. Ogier will get some quotes for servicing companies in the meantime. The more we will want something high level looking, the longer it will take. End of August? September? Next year? Never because of KYC issues? Who knows. I know it\u2019s not easy to manage a business with those kind of answers. I\u2019m sorry for that but making up a fake timeline is not better. ",

                    "content": " Real-World Finance Core Unit Report - 2021-09 September 2021 reporting for Real-World Finance Core Unit   TL;DR  The RWA Foundation and MIP58 are live. SolarX is delayed as a new land should be used. SocGen published a MIP6  @teej and @Eumenes joining the team   Current strategy (changed) The RWF CU is currently focused on RWA. RWA at MakerDAO are considered at the experimentation phase. The current goal is to achieve around 300M in a wide range of assets/structures to learn. It follows a 3 pronged approach:  Off-chain lending: lending without leveraging the blockchain, cash is managed in the real world by legal entities acting on behalf of MakerDAO. For instance, 6S and SolarX are in this bucket. On-chain lending: MakerDAO is investing directly or indirectly (through a legal entity) in a DAI denominated product. Tinlake pools and the OFH token are in this bucket. This adds significant complexity in the short term but allows to leverage of blockchains. Scalable off-chain investments: Both previous buckets are complicated and are taking significant time to assess and monitor and are risky. TradFi offers commoditized products for short-term, low-risk investment. In order to solve the USDC exposure, we can invest in short-term investment-grade ETFs.   Facilitator thoughts After one year of dealing with RWA, here are some thoughts.  Should asset managers be Core Unit? A significant number of MIP6 are new asset managers meaning they are allocating capital (not borrowing for themselves but to lend to third parties). For most of them, the senior capital is coming mainly/exclusively from MakerDAO. We are the lender, but also the main customer. It was my view that, with time, we should move to more institutional asset managers. It seems less risky to have Blackrock invest your money than a young startup. Nevertheless, the latter can offer a deeper relationship with MakerDAO than the former (for which Maker will always be one of many customers). In a decentralized manner, they would provide \u201cinternal\u201d asset management for MakerDAO. Hence, the idea is to have those \u201cAsset Managers\u201d being Core Unit so they have a more direct relationship with the community. They would still have the same business model (management fees, exposure to the junior tranche, excess spread profitability, origination fees, \u2026), therefore no additional budget.  Limiting to 20 slots There is currently around 30 RWA-related MIP6. In my view, we should aim towards 10-20 RWA onboarded collaterals maximum at any time. The crypto-collaterals are already showing that most are a distraction and costing more in Oracles than what we earn (ETH and WBTC are providing 92% of revenues). There is a strong Pareto law. There is a tendency to approve collateral as we want to scale and use RWA to decrease the USDC exposure. It is my view that each new collateral should be intrinsically better than the rest, offer strong diversification, and/or strategic value. This might also mean flipping the system by not using what is submitted as MIP6 but looking for what MakerDAO needs (top/down approach). Following the 20-slot rule of Warren Buffet, have already punched 6 cards. 14 are left. Time to be strategic. The RWF CU will limit itself to 10-20 (active) due to its maximum expected size.  1:1 peg for real for the whole DeFi I\u2019ve published an article on how to solve the peg and enable \u201cfungibility\u201d for all DeFi stablecoins. DeFi spent years now making fees on stablecoins swaps. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. One dollar at any bank or fintech is worth $1. Obviously, DAI has a key role to play here.  Review  State of RWA at MakerDAO New Silver is still the only RWA with significant exposure on MakerDAO and continues to grow steadily. FortunaFi financed it\u2019s first loan. 6S, ConsilFreight, and Harbor Trade Credit have open vaults and will use them as soon as they have assets to finance.   RWA Pipeline The pipeline remains strong and challenging to process. The greenlight process seems contested but it is an important input for the prioritization. We are also improving our internal processes (see MIP6C3-SP1 for instance) by working on a new framework and onboarding new team members.  RWA Committee We are reviving the RWA Committee with a meeting tomorrow. The new version will be RWF presenting 2 challenging topics and getting feedback from the RWA Committee. Thanks to @flipflopflapdelegate and @prose11 for the work here.  Centrifuge improvements updates Following the New Silver audit, both Centrifuge and New Silver are working on providing a better setup. The short-term items were:  Revisit the Independent Director clauses: Centrifuge working with Manatt on Shearman & Sterling comments Construction cash escrow: this is now fixed. True sale vs Security Interest: not yet started Security interest for TIN/DROP holders in the Tinlake Protocol Service Agreement (TPSA): Pro-rata exit: the wording is there, will be used onward. Doesn\u2019t change what is really done. Limitation to change the executive summary: will be negotiated onward. DROP and Investment Company Act: waiting from Centrifuge what are the exemptions for each pool.  The biggest concern is on the collateral agent (which was a medium-term thing). It\u2019s difficult to find a trustee willing to deal with on-chain stuff. We have spent so far very little resources on that. We are mostly working on providing legal ownership of DROP tokens, therefore working on the RWA Foundations.  RWA Foundation The RWA Foundation was incorporated on September 21th. On September 25th, the director took some resolutions:  Appointment of the director, the secretary, and the supervisor Resignation of the subscriber, the RWA Foundation is now orphaned Appointment of Ogier as legal adviser   900\u00d7735 287 KB  There is still quite some work to be done to have something useful. The plan is to get a public process to issue a DAO Resolution. MIP58 was approved. We are already looking to duplicate the structure in Jersey for Nebula Capital and maybe SocGen.  SolarX We are making progress but it\u2019s quite a challenging project. On one front, it\u2019s the first using the RWA Foundations MIP so it\u2019s a learning process on that front (and a KYC/AML with partners which is always taking time). The legal documentation is also quite complex with more than 200 pages of legal documents. Finally, the number of involved parties is significant as you can see in the diagram below (which is just a draft yet).  1279\u00d7771 50.3 KB  The Mattituck property is no longer available. SolarX is providing an alternative but this requires some new work (and a new risk assessment).  Finance Not much to show this month as @Aes joined only at the end and spend time understanding the complex SQL financials queries. A new forecast is in the work and should be out soon.  SocGen Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Forge issue a MIP6 to refinance some bonds. This is the first step after a few months of work (years for Growth CU).  Team We have news teams member with @teej (full-time RWA) and @Eumenes (part-time RWA). They bring invaluable institutional experience.

First of all, I wholeheartedly agree with this and think it\u2019s a great guiding principle. My question is on the implementation. Personally I\u2019d like to see this responsibility continue to reside with the delegates/MKR holders. Given that we have dedicated MKR delegates spending a ton of time in the forums, there\u2019s really no longer an excuse for them to vote for a MIP6 that they don\u2019t want to see onboarded. I think it makes the process more predictable and simpler for everyone if they act as the gatekeepers for collateral (especially considering that was the design intent of the onboarding process in the first place). I\u2019m not saying they should be negotiating terms, just acting as a stop light to control the quality. I also think that they should publish what they\u2019re looking for in collateral if they\u2019re not happy with MIP6s rather than a core unit sourcing deals. It\u2019s important to keep the protocol as a taker and not a maker of business and to keep the various powers that be separate. ",

Delegates can maybe keep a list of 10 collaterals they want to see, updated once a month, and their RWA strategy. On the maker/taker, I\u2019m not sure. I agree that it\u2019s better to have an ecosystem and have RWA Co and Centrifuge sourcing the deals (which are already kind of gates). Yet at the same time, we have deals coming from your old BD team. I\u2019m quite sure we all agree that having SocGen is nice. Broadly, on deals like you might think of, I would say when sourcing is a value add, RWF plans to be as passive as possible. Other CUs can act as they want. Finding good asset-originators/managers can also be a source of alpha. If we want to invest in ESG Bonds, I will not wait for a MIP6, let\u2019s ask directly Blackrock what they can offer. Let\u2019s say a new startup submits a MIP6 to buy ESG bonds, charge 1% on top, and having the risk that they blow off the year after. We didn\u2019t wait for Circle to put a USDC MIP6. ",

                    "content": "April 2021 reporting for Real-World Finance Core Unit  Current strategy Our current strategy is to onboard $300M of real-world assets. While the long-term strategy is to simply invest in senior tranches of structured products rated by credit rating agencies, we recognize that it\u2019s not currently possible in DeFi. We have a two-path approach. First, partnering with Centrifuge, we work on a smart-contract way of investing in structured finance. Second, we are investigating a Trust-based way to invest the MakerDAO balance sheet in the real world using real-world tools. We also think that having a strong capital base (i.e. surplus buffer) will be important to disrupt the traditional finance world. As we recognize that people prefer to burn MKR while it\u2019s seeing as cheap, we also work to inform the market and the community on the financial strength of MakerDAO. We think that if the market recognizes the financial prospects of MakerDAO, the MKR price will increase, giving more opportunity to consolidate the capital base. Such knowledge will also help Maker Governance make more scientific decisions.  Review  New-silver onboarding success New Silver was successfully onboarded and accounted for $588k loans at end of the month. The etherscan transaction is here. We have tested increasing the loan and decreasing it. So far everything works as expected.  851\u00d7302 13.6 KB   Others collaterals While New Silver was the first step, the community is quite bullish on RWA. We will target a batch (3?) of Centrifuge-related RWA onboarding end of May or in June. Risk assessments will be provided shortly and we will onboard what the community wants. On the Trust structure, 6S is providing some documents. We are also working with REINNO and UPRETS on another Trust-like path (@christiancdpetersen). We expect progress to be made shortly. This will allow us to onboard Trust-related RWA using MIP21.  Finance A framework for valuing MKR was proposed by @Aes. While we work on a forecast incorporating the workforce expenses, lack of clarity on the MKR compensation makes it difficult at this stage. You can now have access to a Financial statement spreadsheet to follow financials month per month. You can also find the usual monthly financial presentation of MakerDAO All finance stuff are now aggregated in the finance website  Legal We have started the onboarding of Arnold&Porter, a law firm that will advise us on RWA. The first focus will be an audit of the legal structures of New Silver.  Research Work has started on a follow-up of Crypto-banking 101, dedicated to liquidity issues and solvency with relation to the DSR. Besides that, I found more and more evidence that DeFi needs a clearinghouse system for stablecoin. The Suffolk System is one and the Scottish free banking era provide another one. Curve and the USDC PSM are initials steps towards this system.  955\u00d7215 199 KB   Marketing & PR While not the focus of this core unit, we still spend some time using our work to promote MakerDAO, mainly on CryptoTwitter.  867\u00d7356 37.2 KB  New Silver onboarding also provided a nice article (actually it was not related at the beginning) on Coindesk and an interview on CoindeskTV. Centrifuge also cited us in an article in The Defiant and on their blog. We also were on a panel in a Centrifuge call.  1090\u00d7685 710 KB  Edi: And the April financials did produce a Yahoo Finance news.  Data infrastructure No progress made this month  Public work  Financial statement spreadsheet Core Unit Focus: RWF Framework for valuing MKR Finance website  MakerDAO Finance presentation for April 2021.

                    "content": "July 2021 reporting for Real-World Finance Core Unit   Current strategy (no changes vs last month) Our current strategy is to onboard $300M of real-world assets. While the long-term strategy is to simply invest in senior tranches of structured products rated by credit rating agencies, we recognize that it\u2019s not currently possible in DeFi. We have a two-path approach. First, partnering with Centrifuge, we work on a smart-contract way of investing in structured finance. Second, we are investigating a Trust-based way to invest the MakerDAO balance sheet in the real world using real-world tools. We also think that having a strong capital base (i.e. surplus buffer) will be important to disrupt the traditional finance world. As we recognize that people prefer to burn MKR while it\u2019s seeing as cheap, we also work to inform the market and the community on the financial strength of MakerDAO. We think that if the market recognizes the financial prospects of MakerDAO, the MKR price will increase, giving more opportunities to consolidate the capital base. Such knowledge will also help Maker Governance make more scientific decisions.  Review  State of RWA at MakerDAO New Silver is still the only one RWA on MakerDAO and continue to grow steadily.  2021-07-rwa1586\u00d7577 22 KB   RWA Pipeline An executive to onboard 4 Centrifuge-based assets is still needing some MKR to be executed at the time of writing (5k MKR needed). 6S should submit a finalizing executive soon. For Solar X, a compromise was find to secure the investment at the pre-development phase by adding the land as collateral. The pipeline remains strong and we meet with plenty of prospects around the globe. A significiant amount of MIP6 application where submitted:  Nebula Capital Partners CapitalNow Cannabis Cauris Global Fintech 120dB Films Untangled Finance  The native Ethereum bond from a bank mentionned last month will have it\u2019s MIP6 application end of September if approuved by its executive committee. The main bottleneck is still on the legal structure front (see the research section).  Finance @Aes updated the budget simulator. Even with some Core Unit proposals rejected, we are still not profitable. It is important to note that we are still generating cashflows, the difference being the MKR dilution (but we are remaining well below 1M MKR for the forseeable future). Some needed Core Units are still missing (tech ops for instance).  2021-07-budget1263\u00d7975 88.1 KB   Research Research work is mainly on creating and improving legal structures for RWA. An analysis was done on the Prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures. Work will be done in August to provide an answer to this BIS consultative paper.  Cayman Foundation We are making significant progress on the Cayman Foundation structure. The key component of the structure is that it working in synery with MakerDAO through DAO Resolutions. We are at the third iteration of the Articles of Associations (to be shared in August) and a MIP to formalize the relationship with the Foundation will be published soon.   Securitization 2.0 On-chain securitization is a strong RWA strategy of the Core Unit. The work we are doing on the New Silver audit is highlighting a path toward industry grade securitization. This will be an iterative path but will lead to liquid traded securities rated by credit rating agencies. We will start by framing a roadmap and targeting low hanging fruits before moving to more complex improvments. The roadmap is expected to provide guidance to issuers on what are the milestones they need to achieve to unlock higher Debt Ceiling. For instance, currently, an independent director is needed to get above 5M DC.  RealDAO @jameskmccall submitted a RealDAO Spv Concept which is an interresting way to tokenize assets by using the DAO construct.  Marketing, Communication & PR N/A  Data infrastructure We have continued to work on the MakerDAO Data Warehousing tools adding Snowflake as a database backend.

Because after a couple successive reads, even being in the Group 2 bucket of crypto assets doesn\u2019t actually look very bad. I think all the initial reactions \u2014 my own included \u2014 were based upon quick skims and first reads. I\u2019m just curious if you saw something I didn\u2019t, and if so, what the response would be. ",

                    "content": "    SebVentures:  What did change your mind on Group 2?   It\u2019s not so much that Group 2 is good, but it seems like it won\u2019t be prohibitive for banks to own or trade crypto outright in Group 2 given the typical capital ratio of large banks. It\u2019s probably not very appealing, but it\u2019s not as impossible as I think we assumed at first read. The 1250% seems like a lot (It did to me!) until you sit down and think about what the capital ratio already is on most large banks. For unleveraged positions, even being in Group 2 isn\u2019t a problem. In fact, in many jurisdictions it should result in less capital requirement than the issuers of redeemable stablecoins pledge to hold. If USDC and (supposedly) Tether can do it, then more sophisticated banks presumably can, too. I also don\u2019t think any of the guidelines affected activities that are on behalf of the bank\u2019s customers. The guidelines appear to only be in relation to the bank\u2019s own account. So activities like leveraged proprietary trading are out based on these, but that\u2019s it. For us, I don\u2019t know that leveraged proprietary trading by banks was ever going to make/break us. It\u2019s not that we can\u2019t respond, but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s as disastrous to us (or other crypto) like we assumed at first. I\u2019m open to being convinced otherwise, but that was my take after successive readings. ",
