Since the donation, it has become blatantly obvious that the longevity and sustainability of Akita is directly tied to the decision of voters on the GitCoin community. Given that the timing of the Akita donation was after the required donations to GitCoin projects (to claim GTC), many Akita holders without affiliation to GitCoin were not privy to the information necessary to get that grant of GTC tokens. A donation of Akita tokens means a reduced value per token. That is a donation from the Akita community, in effect. There are now several proposals for how to utilize the Akita donation. Akita holders have a direct stake in the outcome, their participation in voting is imperative. In alternative to providing GTC directly to Akita holders (likely expensive and inefficient), I propose changing the voting structure for the Akita proposal to a venue which would allow for Akita holders inclusion into the voting process. I propose that a poll vote be taken to see if there is community support. ",

Hopefully we can get this AKITA vote up for a snapshot soon and close this interesting, albeit bizarre governance experiment behind us and get back to building. ",

It is also my understanding that the current market value of the Akita donation is roughly $131 million. That would make this an extremely sizable potential value to funding the public goods projects GitCoin deems worthy. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves. On top of that, further community involvement can only be seen as a value-add in a project meant to be a public good. That Akita community deserves to be at this table. An alternative would be to change the voting structure and allow Akita holders to participate directly in a vote on these proposals. ",
