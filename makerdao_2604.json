                    "content": "What does the MakerDAO community thinks about the current MKR tokenomics? In my opinion the burn mechanism is an inefficient value capture mechanism, with possible negative side-effects affecting the whole system. Let\u2019s look at some of the pros and cons of a token burn mechanism vs. a dividend paying mechanism. Pros of the current token burn mechanism:  simplicity already implemented, no need for an additional work/resources to be spent tax efficient (it\u2019s taxed as a capital gain tax), (depends on jurisdiction)  Cons of the current token burn mechanism:  financially inefficient (token buybacks are automatic and happen even when the MKR token is overvalued, actually the buy backs will happen mostly when the market is overvalued, because it\u2019s in the bull market when the supply of DAI > demand, which leads to increase in the stability fees and consequent MKR token buy backs and burns. the current burn mechanism rewards \u201cfree riders\u201d and indirectly incentivizes passive behavior of the MKR token holders (in other words, it socializes rewards comming from the work done by a few active participants, which can lead to demotivation) it decreases rewards of the active MakerDAO participants It\u2019s an inefficient way of using funds that could otherwise be used for example to fund future developement of the protocol or other activities benefiting the MakerDAO/DAI users  Pros of a direct reward mechanism:  it directly rewards and incentivizes active participation because it rewards only active participants (only part of the total MKR supply) it increases intrinsic value of the MKR token ($1 million of rewards divided between 10% of total MKR supply is 10x higher reward per token than dividing the same amount between all MKR holders by buying and burning the MKR token) which will lead to higher demand for MKR > higher market price > higher security of the MakerDAO system (and also less MKR supply dilution when something goes wrong). In other words, the effective reward per token and security of the system will by significantly higher.  Cons of a direct reward mechanism:  tax inefficient (depends on jurisdiction) complexity, potential new bugs and attack vectors, etc\u2026 not implemented yet, additional work and resources would need to be spent towards the implementation  The lists are non-exhaustive so if you can think of some other pros and cons please mention them in the comments. I think a combination of direct DAI rewards, delegated voting and SourceCred can make MakerDAO much more effective system than the current one. What are your thoughts?     I support MKR tokenomics revamp I prefer the current buy back/burn model     0 voters     ",

Eg. an independent domain team could be required to stake MKR as part of their service contract. They could either purchase this themselves, or have existing MKR holders delegate their stake to them in exchange for part of their revenues. The design space for work tokens tokens is huge, but some initial examples include COMP (1% of votes needed to submit proposal), REN (100k collateral required to run dark node, receive share of system revenue), NXM and NMR (staking as decentralized risk assessment). We just increased the surplus threshold from 500,000 to 2 million DAI, so we have a lot of time to figure out how to allocate revenue or change the current buyback/burn system. ",

We do not want to incentivise uninformed people to be creating and voting for initiatives just in order to realize the economic value of their token. I am perfectly content to allow uninformed token-holders to simply hodl and enjoy the ride. To incentivise community-level (non-protocol-level) development, I think systems like SourceCred are promising, and I think it makes sense to explore funding those with protocol revenues. Regarding the burn model, see this article: https://medium.com/@byrnehobart/alpha-buybacks-and-beta-buybacks-ca710997536e IMO the MKR market should be a trader\u2019s responsibility. However, on the same thread, I am concerned that there is no way to correct a strong Dai peg without suffocating the protocol for revenue. ",
