The questions for the first edition, which you can read by searching #uniswapvibes on twitter are:  If Uniswap was ONLY available on an L2, which would you prefer it to be on and why? What is your favorite token pair to provide liquidity for and why? If you could change one thing about Uniswap, what would it be and why?  Cheers and thank you in advance for taking the time to share your vibes ",
