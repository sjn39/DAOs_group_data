Then the device will be able to use the ABI to decode complex DeFi transactions. What even cooler is that we allow user to customize his own ABI into the microSD card. This will enable the user to fully verify a DeFi transaction on his hardware wallet. Please let me know if you have any comments about this. ",

                    "content": "Good point. Right now the plan is: For average users, we will embed top DeFi projects\u2019 (30-50 projects) ABI with our firmware. So they just need to upgrade and that\u2019s it. For power users, we will put those ~60k ABIs into a zip pack. Power users can download it, unzip, put it in microSD and insert it into our hardware wallet (user can put their own ABI into it too). The UX is cumbersome but it can theoretically cover all Defi projects. For average users, we can do one more step to close more attack surfaces-  image1200\u00d71200 213 KB  ",
