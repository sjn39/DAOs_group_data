                    "content": "Overview Hello all, this signal request is a replacement of Restart the burn SR V2 and can be interpreted as V3. Big thank you to @aburban90 for considering concerns brought up by the community and willingness to cooperate and deliver a more sustainable solution for burning MKR which resulted in this SR. This SR is a trial of MIP74: Permissionless Open Market Operations, which will offer plenty of insight into the effectiveness of the module in practice and possible problems which are not visible before actual implementation. I want to remind everyone of the current situation on SB and potential applications of Deploy the balance sheet in ETH SR which is currently in the on-chain polling. Current SB level is at 75.6m dai and the mentioned SR will effectively lower the amount of assets in the surplus buffer which are not correlated with the rest of the crypto market. Risk CU recommends to maintain a surplus buffer higher than the current level in order to lower the probability of MKR minting events in debt auctions in the future. We are exposed to several risks; in addition to market risk, we are exposed to several counterparty related risks such as Lido, Chainlink and the smart contract risks and possibility of exploits associated with existing and new products such as Maker Teleport. Some of the mentioned risks are almost impossible to quantify with a sufficient level of certainty, but it is not hard to imagine the possible consequences of a D3M implemented lending market exploit for example. At the same time, it is clear from several signals and discussions from the community on various channels, that some MKR token holders are not satisfied with the current philosophy in regards to surplus buffer management which advocates for growth instead of burn, and ultimately feel betrayed, as burning always was an integral part of the system and social contract. One of the greatest risks for any decentralized community is to fail to reach a consensus. Crypto history tells that such cases, when not reaching a consensus leads to a split of the community, can lead to devastating and long lasting negative effects on the project. We are potentially approaching crypto winter and general global recession; now is the crucial time to reunite and reach the general consensus on the topic within the community in order to combat the upcoming challenges. We are proposing a simple solution which can be realised in a relatively short time period that may satisfy both parties; maintain a sustainable surplus buffer to support risk mitigation and growth + burn a relatively small amount of surplus buffer in order to assure the community that burning still is, and will remain an integral part of MakerDAO and our community. Main Text We are proposing burning MKR based on specifications listed below using the newly released DssKiln by the PECU. A predetermined amount of dai would be vested from the SB to the contract for the predetermined duration, which would then market buy MKR tokens directly from Uniswap v3 MKR/ETH (0.3% fee) in predetermined dai amounts based on specifications below and burn them by calling the MKR token burn(). The vesting option was chosen to enable governance to cancel the stream and essentially shut down the operation in the case it underperforms or a technical issue is uncovered. The negative side of the vesting solution is that it is much more gas intensive compared to a single deposit solution. Once the operation is tested, governance can change how the contract is funded and lower the keeper cost and ensure the community and market participants that burn will continue. There are possible unwanted instances, such as MEV and similar blockchain based market activity specific risks and griffing attacks, but we believe that the potential benefits of this SR outweighs the unwanted results. The proposed parameters for the permissionless open market operation are designed in a risk and unwanted outcomes minimization manner. The hop general operation parameter is set lower than 3 month linear value in order to increase the cost of potential griffing attack. The griffing attack would result in contract executing trades at 0 value and then being unable to execute trades for the duration of hop. The maximum operation throughput in this operation is limited by the vesting schedule. This will be financed by existing PECU budget. The total burn rate at the current configuration would result in roughly 33.33k dai being burned daily (limited by the vesting schedule), which is quite similar to current flapper configuration which is 1 surplus auction per day, or 30k dai daily. The SR also includes further development and financing of the formal audit of DssKiln which was recommended by PECU before implementation. The rough estimation of costs is described here, the monetary cost is estimated at less than 10k USD, while further required development of functionality will likely increase these costs but not significantly. Current implementation of DssKilnUNIV3BurnStrategy does not support multi market routing and was developed for DAI/MKR market specifically, which is not liquid enough for this operation to be efficient. Therefore, the code has to be further expanded to support DAI->ETH->MKR routing (or potential more optimal steps) as ETH/MKR is substantially more liquid. If this SR passes it won\u2019t interfere with the Deploy the balance sheet in ETH SR. This means that max SB level will remain at 250m and no flap auctions will occur until it crosses that level while still burning MKR tokens on a predetermined schedule. Thank you to @LongForWisdom and @brianmcmichael for helping me put this together. Proposed operation parameters and methodology  Methodology  3m dai will be vested from the Surplus Buffer to the deployed contract for the duration of 3 months The Oversight group will consist of Risk CU and PECU, performance reporting will be conducted in no less than on a monthly basis at when 1m, 2m and 3m have been fully vested   General operation parameters   sell the token to be deposited into DssKiln and sold - [DAI]  buy the token to be bought in exchange for the sold token - [MKR]  hop duration specified in seconds. It represents a minimum number of seconds that must pass before the lot can be sold - [38880 seconds or 10.8 hours]  lot the maximum quantity of tokens to be sold per hop - [30k DAI]   Specific operation parameters  To be published by Risk CU and PECU once the code required is fully developed and all operation specific parameters are defined    Signal Request Poll Do you support the proposed solution explained above, including (i) proposed operation methodology (ii) Proposed General & Specific (to be decided by Risk CU and PECU) DssKiln operation parameters, (iii) financing and further required development of DssKiln formal audit with the surplus buffer facilitated by PECU?    Do you agree with the three points stated above?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     EDIT; The mentioned costs related to code development and audit will be financed from the existing PECU budget and not from the SB as previously suggested. Next Steps The poll will run until Thursday 6/9/2022, 12 am CET; which will be followed by an on-chain poll assuming the outcome is yes. ",

If this actually happens due to some unexpected stream of dai into surplus like from liquidation penalty, governance can just stop the vesting to the DssKiln proposed by this SR and shut it down. In the case where the DssKiln burn mechanism proves effective, governance can decide to stop flap auctions altogether and use DssKiln instead. In either way, everything is optional and will be decided by the MKR holders. Also, this is just a trial, once the 3m dai is burned, another MIP74 subproposal will be required to implement the new operation. ",

I\u2019m not exactly sure what the recommendation is right now but with the drop in nonstablecoin collateral, surplus to nonstablecoin DAI ratio is getting close to 4%, a much higher buffer than MKR has ever had.

It is my clear view that what is needed is a steady solution that is allowed to work over time to solidify trust and to show a lasting commitment.

Two: If one believes the economic impact does not match the lore of the burn, is it appropriate to continue for emotional reasons?

Crypto history tells that such cases, when not reaching a consensus leads to a split of the community, can lead to devastating and long lasting negative effects on the project.   The greatest risk to the protocol is insolvency. If as you say we are \u201capproaching crypto winter and general global recession\u201d then it would be extremely risky to burn any MKR now, as crypto and broader markets will continue to deteriorate. Before any burn decision is made, I strongly believe we need a risk metric that defines and quantifies what our Surplus Buffer should be. Capital at Risk is an excellent metric to start with, but is far too volatile for us to use for making capital allocation decisions. Additionally, our annualized stability fees have cratered in the past three weeks, from ~$76M to $36M (-53%). Until stability fees start to stabilize and the DAO better understands it\u2019s cash runway relative to the risk metric defining an appropriate Surplus Buffer, burning is irresponsible. I understand people are frustrated with the bear market and the macro situation the markets are in, but taking a step back, MKR has actually outperformed ETH and other major crypto tokens on a YTD basis and I believe is very well positioned to do so in this bear market if accretive capital allocation decisions are made.  image1623\u00d71444 344 KB  ",

For example, imagine if there\u2019s an error in the code or extreme market condition that cost beyond the surplus buffer, that gap is not easily filled and also causes more uncertainty and price drop. The MKR price has been declining but without a doubt, if the Maker protocol has to go through another auction to recapitalize, it will likely drop much more. Therefore, while I understand the sentiment to restart the burn, as my initial reasoning hasn\u2019t changed, maintaining my view that resurrecting the burn is too early. However, I do agree with the sentiment that the protocol needs to be conservative with spending and cost especially as they have been increasing despite decreasing revenues. ",

MKR holders are paying a massive budget already, it is the job of the core units to manage their spending in order to meet the priorities that MKR holders want. Income has cratered and Maker is now unprofitable, and the trend is that income will continue to go down, resulting in further unprofitability and risk that the surplus buffer will begin to naturally unwind. We need to look for creative ways to reduce spending, not creative ways to spend even more beyond the existing 60 million budget. To clarify I am not against increasing spend in all situations, but rather that we need to have a clear understanding what we are getting in return for the money we are spending. Why exactly should we spend 60 million per year on the core units if it can\u2019t even pay for getting the burn restarted? Increasing spend should only happen with very clear, well documented plans that set measurable expectations of results. I am in general for starting the burn, but given that we are already unprofitable I see it only as a symbolic act where having the technical infrastructure in place, and doing it with symbolic amounts, provides an outsized intangible value as it helps restore confidence in the DAO and can repair some of the alienation of regular small-scale community members that I think has occured. Edit: After discussing this with Rema on the governance discord, they are going to find ways to fund this with existing CU budget, even though that was not the original intention. I\u2019m leaving up this post because I think it is very important to make the point that signalling a culture of loose spending can be very damaging right now when the community generally feels that value isn\u2019t being delivered for the massive budgets that MKR holders are paying for.

The current proposal, while well-meaning, is crucially missing performance measurement. Even just a straight price target may be unsuitable on its own, unless it accurately captures the potential ROI of missed opportunities (backing risk on new sources of revenue, etc), which is the point of deprioritizing returning funds to shareholders vs growing value for shareholders as a capital allocation decision. Companies don\u2019t switch between the two on a dime like Maker appears to do. Our inability to hold a view around this basic question is the great vulnerability at the heart of our decentralization. Tim\u2019s proposal would remove some MKR holder authority around a crucial capital allocation toggle switch. But it would benefit the stability of the protocol as a whole. ",

From my Discord comments: Memes have been the most powerful force in human history. America is a meme. Christianity is a  meme. (Don\u2019t @ me, I\u2019m a believer so no offense). Memes cannot be easily dismantled. A meme is a story we tell ourselves to feel better. It\u2019s that feeling which shapes thoughts, which shapes words, which shapes actions, which creates the future. In today\u2019s world memes are dismissed by many because they are usually degen and camp. But that is the wrong take. There\u2019s a deadly serious spirit behind the memes today. The extent of their comedy shows the depths of the pain people are in and need a laugh to express their truth. I remain convinced that the economic case for the burn does not check out empirically. But I supported the proposal because the symbolism will set the meme on fire. This will do more for us at this moment than any rational act. \u2026 I would say in these waters there\u2019s a lot of belief in math and the quantitative - so that\u2019s what I was highlighting with the term \u201crational\u201d.

Our inability to hold a view around this basic question is the great vulnerability at the heart of our decentralization. Tim\u2019s proposal would remove some MKR holder authority around a crucial capital allocation toggle switch. But it would benefit the stability of the protocol as a whole.   Well, I actually think the solution to this is the hybrid approach where a portion of profits is just promised for burning.  I think this would satisfy the pro burn contingent.  It\u2019s just that the growth side doesn\u2019t seem to want to give up that piece of income.  I think judging the burn based off short term price movements is short sighted as well.  Of course MKR price responds more to macro factors and fundamentals.  But this doesn\u2019t mean that reducing supply does not return value.  Investors who like buybacks and things like the burn are actually often are long term thinkers.  Irregardless to price movements, they enjoy watching supply go down and anticipate one day when lower supply does get reflected in price. But now we end up debating how we find stability in our capital allocation choices.  What I do agree with is that currently, we don\u2019t have the income to burn and becoming profitable again is most important to long term success.  Some might argue that the price is low so if we do anticipate income in the near future through things that are being worked on, now is a good time to burn.  But that\u2019s a bet that comes with heightened risk and it shouldn\u2019t be too big of a bet.  This experiment at least gives us added benefit of testing dsskiln.  I wouldn\u2019t expect any desire for further burns without return to clear profitability. ",

Introducing a burn as an element of corporate governance and an effective budget cap is a different point that could be made into a more coherent framework than a one-off purchase. I\u2019d definitely be open to it as an advocate of token holder rights (of which there are very few atm). edit:  (of which there are very few atm)  in reference to the rights not the advocates edit vf: there is at least one MKR whale who thinks the same: SebVentures platform ",

YES- For us, the decision here is pretty clear. If all goes well, this proposal gives value back to the Maker token itself and incentivizes risk-averse investors to contribute. Importantly, this decision takes into account the wants of both governance members and token holders, somewhat reaching a consensus as outlined by @rema. Even in the off chance that these operations fail in practice, the protocol further develops DssKiln and will not reimplement this initiative after this trial is over. ",
