As a meta EIP it can be quickly finalized.  The sooner devs stop creating contracts depending on SELFDESTRUCT the easier it is to change the functionality. EIP4758 is how SELFDESTRUCT can be deprecated by changing/removing functionality and will require an upgrade.  It is not yet CFI\u2019d, so at this rate might not be included in Shanghai upgrade and would have to wait for Cancun. ",

Overall I am still debating myself with existence of EIP-4578 and EIP-4760, how much more value does a third Meta EIP brings to the table.
