Hard forks at the time of PoW sunset / ETH 1 > ETH2 merge do not represent a threat at all, but a natural freedom to oppose any change in the protocol. We should not fear hard forks, even if the result is an Ethereum PoW chain remaining with the Ethereum full PoS chain in place. The market is and should be the ultimate arbiter there. Since there is no clear threat to the network presented by the author as of today to warrant this change, this EIP should not be merged until such time as a demonstrable threat exists. Further, the network is regularly paying in excess of $5m (exceeding $10m multiple times now as well) a day in fees alone to miners, which hardly warrants any consideration for an issuance increase. 1559 aims to fix the asymmetric benefit from usage and the fee market from just miners to the entirety of the ecosystem via fee burns, while committing to still provide a portion and the current block subsidy while Ethereum remains reliant on miners to provide security.

                    "content": "In the Eth R&D discord, someone raised the question about whether the paying the bare minimum for security is even preferable. With block chain security, you won\u2019t find out that you\u2019ve made a mistake until an attack has occurred, and at that point it is far too late to slap a band-aid on it and say \u201coops.\u201d Social contracts also serve as a method for the powerful to maintain control over those less powerful. When the social contract actively harms one of the participants, there is no incentive for them to maintain it. Especially when the people with power feel safe enough to disregard the concerns of others. In response to the statement about fixing the asymmetric benefits of the fee market, that is factually wrong. An 11% decrease in miner revenues in exchange for the retention of 0.34% more fiat value of Ethereum is the very definition of an asymmetric benefit. Any reduction in issuance through miner revenues will have a disproportionate impact on miners because that is just how reducing inflation works. Furthermore, the threat of miner unionization  has been growing rapidly during the past 2 weeks due to the blatant disregard of miner interests in the community. If a 5.8% reduction in the value of Ethereum too much to pay to help resolve the issues that were created by freezing miners out of the community for the past 3 years, then maybe you should reconsider your stance on these issues because you aren\u2019t even willing to give up half of what you\u2019re asking the miners to sacrifice.

At that time it was clearly stated that miners were members of the community. Now when it fits the core devs agenda to further manipulate price the miner are just service provides. The 5 block reward would decrease price and therefore lower transaction fees. Some devs and many holder have enjoyed a 5x growth within the last months. They fail to realize the security that miners have provided is a major contributor to the continued growth. Not only that but they are more than willing to cut rewards again. ",
