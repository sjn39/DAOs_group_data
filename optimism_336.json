But the sheer volume of activity combined with the large number of posts in [DRAFT] or [REVIEW] stages means that it can be difficult to ensure delegates and voters find all upcoming proposals. Specifically, there is not an easy way to sort posts to consistently and quickly see all proposals that are seeking feedback or coming up for a vote. Even sorting by \u201clatest\u201d or by a category often returns mostly threads that are dated, locked, or simply not active proposals. We would like to request that some solution is created for this. One possibility is simply a separate forum where all grant applications can live and be discussed. This would help delegates monitor input from others and track changes. Non-grant proposals could be either marked differently or in a second area. Another possibility could be to maintain an independent \u201cbulletin board\u201d somewhere that simply lists and links to the threads of any active proposals or drafts seeking feedback. Ideally it would track or report when the text of a grant proposal had changed. This is also a good opportunity to make it highly visible that there are different categories of governance in whatever solution is adopted (grants being the most common at the moment, but not the only responsibility of Token House). There are likely other solutions, but we wanted to bring this pain point to the attention of the OP team. Please let us know if there\u2019s any way we can assist with whatever solution you deem best. CC: @lavande ",
