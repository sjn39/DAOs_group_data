We use the standard OpenZeppelin implementation. The OpenZeppelin code has been audited by Level K   Overview Questions  Please provide a short summary of your project.  FND offers an asset-backed security token for real estate investments with a fully approved prospectus by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). Investors can choose to invest in EUR or in the cryptocurrency ETH. Repayments will be made accordingly. The token generates a planned annual yield of 4% plus returns from possible sales revenues. The Token will bring liquidity into a traditional illiquid asset class and will be able to be traded on both licensed exchanges as well as decentralized exchanges 24/7.   Please list the founding members.  Management Board and Shareholders  Thomas Ermel Felix Ermel     What type of crypto asset is it (utility, work, governance, etc)?  Security token (=tokenized bond). A bond is a traditional financial product that can have a variety of characteristics. One key characteristic is the repayment of the invested amount at the end of the term, which is accompanied by a fixed or variable return throughout the lifecycle of the bond. The FND Real Estate Token is no different: the issuer is obliged to pay back 100% of the investment at the end of term, as well as a variable return that depends on the performance of the assets. FND expects the current return of the Real Estate Token to be around 4% p.a. from rents. In case a property is sold, the expected return could double to 8% p.a. from sales proceeds that will be passed on to the investors. more info on medium and on our website   What was the date of the ICO?

You are however the first real estate project to seek such approval so if the community asks uninformed or tone-deaf questions there is no ill will involved, just an online group of very different people that will need to learn about your business and your token contracts. The present model for approving tokens to become CDP approved is aimed towards governance and utility type tokens, not security tokens such as yours so there will be a slightly different focus compared to ICO type tokens. This will be necessary as centralised assets such as STOs present different risks compared to decentralized governance and utility tokens. I will start of with some very basic questions:   Who is the person handing in the application (in this case @peterpan) and is he/she acting with the approval of the Fundament Group CEO? I do not want to sound overly paranoid but in theory @peterpan might not even be working for Fundament Group. This is highly unlikely to be an issue in this case but will be of importance later on as there are multiple thousands of real estate companies worldwide and we need a streamlined process for onboarding them.   How will the bond yield distribution work with regards to the FUND token? How does the distribution (if any) work when the FUND token in locked up in an CDP?   Slightly more difficult questions: All STOs (not just FUND) are vulnerable to exits. A company could raise funds and issue tokens, but the company might face difficulties and might not be able to fulfill its obligations to token holders. We therefore need to check the legal link between your FUND token and the bonds issued in order to prevent doublespend and to gain insight to what happens if the company must halt operations for any reason.  Please describe legal link between FUND tokens and the bonds sold by Fundament Group. In the case of Fundament Group ceasing operations, how will a FUND holder in Argentinia be able to get a (partial) refund? What legal priority does FUND holders have in case of liquedation? Behind employees? Behind employees and fiat bank? I am sure you have been over this with BaFin multiple times but we have not. Please describe the process that proves that Fundament Group is not able to issue more FUND tokens than is guaranteed by bond sales. This might be a tricky one as we would prefer a API link either to you or to BaFin. I am certain you have thought this one through and are able to deliver much better feeds compared to the annual lawyer statements of Tether.  ",

This clause essentially codifies a unilateral right of the issuer to terminate all the contracts between the issuer and the investor. The issuer could be interested to do this, e.g. when they receive an interesting buy-out offer for the total portfolio in the fund. Generally-speaking this is not a likely event to occur but contractually-speaking the option exists. Technically, the issuer would send an email to all token holders of which they possess a confirmed email address. For all other token holders (i.e. those who acquired their token on the aftermarket), the issuer would publish the cancellation notice on the website of the issuer. Once cancelled, token holders have somewhere between 3 and 4 years time to give their token back to the issuer in return for the repayment amount. That timespan is determined by German statute of limitation. How that affects token locked up in CDPs, please read answer below.  How are individual tokens identified for cancellation, especially since the FUND tokens are tradable on DEXs? (with zk stuff anonymous exchanges will be around soon) What would lead to cancellation of only some FUND tokens.  It is very unlikely that individual bonds will be cancelled. It could happen, if - for example - it is unlawful to maintain the contractual relationship with the specific investor due to a court order.  Technically how would termination interface with FUND tokens locked in CDPs?  As mentioned above, should the bonds be cancelled (all at once) prematurely, then token holders have 3-4 years after cancellation to get the token out of CDPs and transfer them back to the issuer to receive the repayment amount. If that time should not be sufficient (which is something we would love to learn about here in this discussion), we could imagine a deterministic smart contract-based solution to the problem. E.g. upon expiration of repayment claims by token holders (i.e. 3+ years after cancellation of the bonds) the issuer could determine the amount of FUND token still locked up in CDPs and park the corresponding total repayment amount as DAI in a smart contract. Once a FUND token is then removed from a CDP the token holder could transfer the token to the issuer\u2019s DAI repayment contract and receive the repayment amount. In addition to simply sending the FUND token to the repayment contract, the token holder potentially has to present an on-chain-verifiable proof, that they had that amount of token locked up in a given CDP contract at the day of expiration of the underlying repayment claims. This is to prevent potential abuse cases. In principle, the same mechanism can be applied to repayment at the time of maturity of the bond (i.e. end of term) as well as to annual dividend payments. Whenever any of these legal claims expires, the issuer can deploy a smart contract where the (re-)payment sum corresponding to token locked-up in CDPs is parked and deterministically paid out to qualified token holders.  Is the annual interest payout in ether sent to wallets holding token? What if token is held in exchange wallets?  No, we prefer a pull mechanism for obvious reasons. On a blockchain, you should never send anything to any address without prior confirmation of whoever controls that address. Instead, we will provide a smart contract that allows token holders to pull the respective dividends into their wallets. Conveniently, token holders will pay the individual transaction fees for that. Token holders can choose whether they want repayment in crypto or fiat. We are working on providing multiple crypto currencies for (re-)payment. Needless to say that we would love to offer repayments in DAI  ",

We see great potential in FUND token becoming a collateral in CDP. I think we all share this excitement here. <3  Real estate tokens such as FUND are in theory prime material for CDPs. You are however the first real estate project to seek such approval so if the community asks uninformed or tone-deaf questions there is no ill will involved, just an online group of very different people that will need to learn about your business and your token contracts.  Thank you for the heads up. We are ourselves comprised of a mix of crypto and legal people, so we\u2019re having these conversations for 2 years already internally in our team. We have a massive amount of respect for the maker community and what you guys have built over the past years. It\u2019s a truly a massive ecosystem and amazing community. We are proud to join the family and we\u2019ll be super respectful with regards to all questions asked. There are no stupid questions, just bad answers.  The present model for approving tokens to become CDP approved is aimed towards governance and utility type tokens, not security tokens such as yours so there will be a slightly different focus compared to ICO type tokens. This will be necessary as centralised assets such as STOs present different risks compared to decentralized governance and utility tokens.  Makes total sense. Indeed, the risk profile is partially different and to us it\u2019s super important that both sides develop an appropriate understanding of that. In our experience that also means that we have to resolve some of the unfounded paranoia of crypto people when it comes to the legal system. We have encountered many unwarranted fears around KYC and AML-related topics, just to name one topic. We want to keep the discussion focused around actual constraints defined in the written law, as opposed to hearsay of what is and isn\u2019t \u2013 supposedly \u2013 possibly today de lege lata (to drop a fancy lawyer expression here)  I will start of with some very basic questions:     Who is the person handing in the application (in this case @peterpan and is he/she acting with the approval of the Fundament Group CEO?

I am part of the Fundament team. As a proof, we have shared our application within our Telegram Group (cf. link on official website) from the Investor Relations admin-account.  image.png1204\u00d7912 147 KB     How will the bond yield distribution work with regards to the FUND token? How does the distribution (if any) work when the FUND token in locked up in an CDP?    See my previous answer ITT. To recap:  token holders\u2019 legal claims for (re-)payment have an expiration date of 3+ years once a claim expires, issuer could set up a deterministic repayment contract filled with DAI for the amount of token still locked up in CDPs at expiry date from then on, token holders can trigger payment anytime through smart contract by sending token to the smart contract & possibly an on-chain verifiable proof that the token were locked up in a given CDP at expiry date of legal claim   Slightly more difficult questions: All STOs (not just FUND) are vulnerable to exits.  You mean the issuing entity could go insolvent/bankrupt? Yes, that is a risk that we have also mentioned explicitly many times in the prospectus for purposes of investor protection. Kind of offtopic but still relevant IMHO, the same risk applies to any ICO ever done. An ICO\u2019s issuing entity could also go bankrupt with the result that token holders cannot expect any (more) of the promised functionality behind the token to be actually developed and implemented. In fact, that risk has realized itself in a growing number of instances, see e.g. envion or base coin. As a matter of fact, the issuer of the FUND token is not a \u201cstartup\u201d in a classical sense. The asset management team of Fundament Real Estate is not developing fancy/unproven technology or trying to build a multi-sided market/platform of any kind. Quite the opposite, the asset managers are buying and selling German (commercial) real estate. Of course there are risks around that and all of them are explicitly discussed in the prospectus. But the risk of this failing is very much different from any normal startup out there. But even in case of bankruptcy of the issuer, an insolvency administrator will take over control and will sell off all the assets of the issuer and disburse the profits to the investors. This procedure is supervised by the courts in Germany. This is one of the many reasons why we picked Germany as the base jurisdiction: there is a reliable set of institutions prepared to handle such cases for the benefit of investors.  A company could raise funds and issue tokens, but the company might face difficulties and might not be able to fulfill its obligations to token holders. We therefore need to check the legal link between your FUND token and the bonds issued in order to prevent doublespend and to gain insight to what happens if the company must halt operations for any reason.     Please describe legal link between FUND tokens and the bonds sold by Fundament Group. In the case of Fundament Group ceasing operations, how will a FUND holder in Argentinia be able to get a (partial) refund? What legal priority does FUND holders have in case of liquedation? Behind employees? Behind employees and fiat bank? I am sure you have been over this with BaFin multiple times but we have not.    The FUND token is the bond itself. Holding the token in your wallet is like keeping a paper certificate of some shares under your pillow. Yes, you heard right. This is the crazy innovation behind all of what we\u2019re doing. We bring back full control over your securities. The token certifies, that the holder is considered a creditor of the issuer and the issuer treats the token holder as such. There are no parallel structures or rivalry of bookkeeping systems (on- and off-chain). The only valid ledger Fundament Real Estate will acknowledge is its Token Smart Contract on the public Ethereum network. It is that simple. There is not any kind of \u201cintermediation\u201d between the token itself and the legal claims (in total referred to as \u201cthe bond\u201d) it represents. This means that by holding the token you actually hold the financial instrument, just as if you held a paper-based bond in your hand. In the timespan between the de-facto abolishment of paper-based bonds and now, where we introduce token-based bonds, it was de facto not possible for investors to actually own the bonds they bought themselves. So this is truly the biggest innovation in all of this. The FUND token is essentially a digital bearer instrument! When token holders want to trigger a payment based on a claim enshrined in the bond/token, they simply interact with the issuer either through our investor dashboard or through a smart contract provided by the issuer (see some of the examples stated in my previous answer ITT).  Please describe the process that proves that Fundament Group is not able to issue more FUND tokens than is guaranteed by bond sales. This might be a tricky one as we would prefer a API link either to you or to BaFin. I am certain you have thought this one through and are able to deliver much better feeds compared to the annual lawyer statements of Tether.  The limit of tokens that can be minted is stipulated in the prospectus. You can check it out in the official database of BaFin. Click here: https://portal.mvp.bafin.de/database/VPInfo/prospekt.do?bereich=3&details=true&cmd=zeigeProspektEmittentenSuche&id=25958886&typId=40&locale=en_GB If you issue more token than you are allowed to sell, you have BaFin (German Financial Market Authority) and the Bundesbank (German Central Bank) coming after you. On this note, there has never been a Fundament Token that has not been bought for 1\u20ac per token. There are no free tokens for team or advisors etc. All token will be sold. There is no dilution for our investors. Once the official placement period is over, we could hand over the ability to mint new token to 0x0. However, we might not do that, in order to retain the ability to issue a second prospectus that allows us to do a capital increase on the current bonds. That means that we would apply to BaFin for the permission to sell more token. Again, there are no bonds outside the scope of the token smart contract. The smart contract is basically the single source of truth. Thus, everyone is welcome to check out the current amount of tokens using etherscan and make sure it is not exceeding the limit according to the prospectus: 0x423d8321be3dd7ebff5b6c7da2ef6614b8547acf (token contract address) Regarding lawyer statements: Fundament Real Estate will get audited at least once a year by an external independent auditor. The audit report will be published on our website. In principle, the audit report will look as boring and \u201cunstructured\u201d (in a technical sense) like any other audit document. However, we\u2019re very much interested in providing a structured, standardized data feed on the recent reportings including net asset value of the portfolio etc. However, I don\u2019t believe such a data standard currently exists. If the maker community is interested in developing this, we\u2019d be interested to discuss. ",

The only case we can imagine where the token and the underlying split is in case of a wallet being hacked. Legally-speaking, the thief does not acquire ownership of the token nor the underlying. This situation leads to two questions:  When the thief/hacker sells the token to a third party which is in good faith about the thief/hacker being the actual owner of the token & underlying, can the buyer in principle acquire ownership of the token and the underlying? When the issuer fulfills the claims of dividend payout & repayment at maturity of the bond, can they pay to whoever is the current token holder, be it the thief/hacker or third party which acquired the token \u201cin good faith\u201d (regardless of whether that was actually possible or not), with effect of discharging their contractual payment obligation?  The answer to question (1.) is disputed in academia and no decision of the highest court in Germany (BGH) exists The answer to question (2.) is a clear yes: regardless of how you answer question (1.), the issuer can always render their payment obligation in a manner that discharges their contractual duties, except for when they were positively aware of the token holder not being the actual owner. Such a positive awareness, however, can effectively not be created. Because how do you positively prove a hack? Besides positive awareness, gross negligence could also be sufficient. The same applies: under which circumstances could the issuer be grossly negligent about a token holder not being the actual owner of the underlying claims? We cannot imagine a scenario where this is possible. Long story short, the issuer\u2019s one and only interest is to respect the token smart contract and nothing else. We cannot imagine a practical case, where the issuer had to respect anything other than the token smart contract.  Any historical example related to German real estate bonds rapidly changing value following legal action would be appreciated.  historically, this particular problem where the connection between the certificate of a bond and the underlying legal claim got under attack with the consequence of the underlying losing value rapidly in the market does not exist. for a long time now, investors never had ownership of the actual certificate. all they have is a depot at a bank where they don\u2019t actually own the certificate, just a very narrow contractual relationship with the depot bank.

As a sidenote, I personally am grateful for the learning opportunity.     peterpan:  token holders have 3-4 years after cancellation to get the token out of CDPs and transfer them back to the issuer to receive the repayment amount. If that time should not be sufficient (which is something we would love to learn about here in this discussion), we could imagine a deterministic smart contract-based solution to the problem.   It is my understanding that from Maker\u2019s point of view, a plan which gradually reduces collateral value over time is preferable to one which suddenly gives it a value of 0, even if that event is planned in advance. Why? Because with plan 1, when a CDP holder disappears into thin air, Maker can use the gap (however small) between unsafe and undercollateralised to liquidate the asset without incurring net MKR inflation. I may be missing something here so others please correct me if that\u2019s the case  Anyway that would make the \u201csmart contract with locked DAI\u201d solution much, much better. However it also looks like this solution would make you go beyond what\u2019s expected & your legal obligations, right? A possible alternative would be a contract that, starting 3-4 years after cancellation, gradually pays out less and less for the bond tokens.     peterpan:  Once the official placement period is over, we could hand over the ability to mint new token to 0x0.

That means that we would apply to BaFin for the permission to sell more token.   Unless I\u2019m missing something, the costs associated with minting new bonds from a fresh address carrying a contract copy are negligible compared to giving up on the reputational benefits of giving minting authority to 0x0. As you mentioned the attitude distribution towards legal guarantees is quite idiosyncratic around Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Generally speaking: if there\u2019s something you never intend to do and if no additional risks are created, it is culturally appropriate to tie your own hands with code.     peterpan:  You\u2019re hitting a point that is dogmatically interesting albeit pragmatically irrelevant.       peterpan:  It is very unlikely that individual bonds will be cancelled. It could happen, if - for example - it is unlawful to maintain the contractual relationship with the specific investor due to a court order.   It is still necessary to know exactly what would happen and when given this very unlikely scenario. ",

A possible alternative would be a contract that, starting 3-4 years after cancellation, gradually pays out less and less for the bond tokens.   Yes, the issuer would go beyond their legal obligations if he setup such a contract at expiry date of the claims. I do like the idea of gradually reducing the payout rate.

Generally speaking: if there\u2019s something you never intend to do and if no additional risks are created, it is culturally appropriate to tie your own hands with code.   The problem with creating a new smart contract is that this would create a new token as opposed to increasing the supply of the already existing/established/integrated token. That\u2019s the only yet to us quite important reason why we consider leaving minting rights open. Beyond that I fully agree with you that if possible, we should tie your hands with code. I think we\u2019ve done that as much as possible in all respects. As with all questions raised here, we\u2019re open to consider all positions.     swakya:  It is still necessary to know exactly what would happen and when given this very unlikely scenario.   In principle the same as with any other payout scenario: a (re)payment claim is created, that claim expires at some point and then again the issuer could transfer unclaimed money to a smart contract to satisfy CDP-locked-up token.

Unlike other cryptocurrency assets, FUND is not completely decentralized. That said, I think as a community we need to keep in mind pragmatism and that it is a boon for our platform to have some form of physical assets to reduce volatility and increase usefulness for a broader community of people. As long as these risks are clear, and an effort is made to reduce counter party and other risks as much as possible, this seems like a wonderful addition. I don\u2019t have any authority here, and don\u2019t know what next steps are, but just wanted to voice my support. ",
