This is why these various anon community members feel taken advantage of by the way you approached this CU. The offboarding is unfortunate and this CU received feedback prior to this situation that would have avoided this entirely. In the growth pill instance, you are likely operating against your mandate. You can see this confusion above in your own statements. The conflict and risk you and this \u201cinformal\u201d group pose to both the workforce at large and the security of the protocol is serious. It is truly unfortunate to see a hierarchy form that has failed to consider any of the substantive technical contributors.

Not to mention within DAO, unless we want to invite legal understanding outside, we should look at what is permissible within governance frameworks. For example, some might object to initiative to offboarding in a short time period. There\u2019s no governance rule against proposing such initiative and therefore I also think it\u2019s valid. Or anonymous accounts applying as delegates. There\u2019s no rule against it either. In similar fashion, there\u2019s no rule within Maker governance that explicitly states you can\u2019t voice your opinion or work / help with other CUs or even interested upcoming CUs (like LOVE CU right now). Also, what exactly is personal gain. Financial gain? Reputation? Is CU talking with delegates to appeal their case also considered personal gain as CUs get the benefit? Thus, unless there\u2019s a governance rule that explicitly prohibit it or their actions actively undermine core work, I think it\u2019s fine or at least tolerable. ",

This makes sense as they are \u201cin charge\u201d and tasked with bridging comms between the core unit and the broader community. However, we do not make any contributor to GovAlpha adhere to neutrality, provided they are clearly expressing their personal view and not that of the Core Units.

Back at the Foundation we were very careful to always clarify if we were talking in personal capacity and make that distinction clear. The DAO doesn\u2019t have to be the same, but for me it\u2019s pretty obvious that there is no distinction made. The theoretical rule is just held up as a justification to keep using one role to support the other. The exact opposite of careful disclosure and separation of the two. I\u2019m assuming this is not in bad faith. But in reality it can be deceitful and we need to be careful. So I suggest we seriously show some effort to avoid the most obvious confusions. ",

I understand the sentiment of wanting to differentiate between someone\u2019s role within their Core Unit and their broader impact within the community. However, I feel this concept is quite reductive given our organisational model (DAO). I believe that the multifaceted aspects of CU members are a unique reason why people choose to work at a DAO instead of a corporation. I would even argue it\u2019s our unique competitive advantage. In the opposite scenario would have only a few selected individuals weighing in on matters (even if they are \u201cpolitical\u201d) while the rest are in their respective silos. I myself have not been vocal in the forum. Still, I sincerely appreciate the people who are, whether or not their opinions align with my personal views. I\u2019m concerned about the path you are opening here, as I feel it limits the contribution of self-motivated contributors. I\u2019ll offer my own set of leading questions:  Whose role is compatible with \u201cpolitical ambitions\u201d? Is SES in a unique position to do so? Should PE abstain from any \u201cpolitical\u201d discussions? Even those that may affect the core functioning of the protocol? Why are these ambitions \u201cunbounded\u201d? Should this word be interpreted negatively?  Lately, I\u2019ve been reconsidering whether or not I should be more vocal with personal views in public. My main fear has been that in voicing my opinions, I may negatively affect the work we do at DICU. I worry it will affect the great people I work with and, ultimately, the community I serve. Given the reactions to this and similar topics in the forum as of late, I feel my fears might be true. I want to see Maker and everyone involved thrive together. ",

I have seen on-line communities decimated by users having multiple accounts.  Like one malicious actor could use like 3-5 accounts to basically set up some premise, have another vehemently attack, and then the other couple support varying points of view ALL to just to try to get attention to themselves by the community.   These people would purposely pick divisive issues and lay them out in some inflammatory way to satisfy their own ambitions (need for attention, desire to attack the community generally, or ??) The idea that anyone \u2018is neutral\u2019 I think is incorrect.  We all have inherent biases and predilections and I find it better when individuals simply come forward with these vs. endeavoring to present this \u2018I am neutral\u2019 kind of view.   As soon as I hear this from anyone I want to run because I know they probably are NOT going  to actualy be able to entertain \u2018objective views\u2019 because they are already \u2018subjectively neutral\u2019. So in reality here there are multiple issues.  Multiple accounts with same users, and this idea of of objective neutrality.  Both of these create numerous obstacles when it comes to communicating effectively, and generally dilute the ability to have constructive dialogue. In the end this is a tricky discussion because one has to not just subjectively disclose our non-neutrality, but then also manage debates and discussions with others who also are non-neutral and decidedly on other sides of important topics.   Healthy vs. unhealthy debate is a real issue, just as healthy vs. unhealthy discussion is. ",

There seems to be two things going on:  a group performing ongoing business operations on behalf of makerdao and representing the DAO in transactions, and a group planning a new governance and business structure for Maker.  These groups are composed of seemingly the same people This ops group asked for this privilege and approach be formally codified their role  (task force) and the signs from the DAO so far has been to resoundingly reject that structure and your request. Those activities and that structure should then immediately cease until a different interim structure can be approved. Can you please disclose who this above group is? Is this simply the task force group? Who is different across the task force vs this \u201cinformal group\u201d redesigning the DAO structure. As you can imagine, the concern is there is no clear boundary to warrant the claim of it being \u201cinformal.\u201d On the other hand, this \u201cinformal group\u201d is meeting in private with VCs to put together a vision and business strategy that is not being publicly disclosed or including other relevant core unit members and MKR holders in the process. This is a transparency problem as you can imagine. Unfortunately, it seems like the same people are part of both groups. Hence, the cause for concern. All or most of these parties in the informal group are also contracted as mandated actors by the DAO and engaging collectively in private with no transparency. This activity is allegedly done as informal meetings because of the gross ethical violations it otherwise presents. I think if you can just lay out transparently what has happened and who you are meeting with, why, and when, as well as the substance of the discussions it would help your credibility. Suggesting these meetings are informal, but that they involve cross core unit member coordination, business activity, and are directly relevant to different lines of business and involve only a subset of MKR stakeholders is tenuous at best\u2026 ",

I\u2019m speaking on my own behalf and not representing the views of delegators or the risk core unit) I\u2019d like to share a quick anecdote from recent experience. I\u2019ve been a Cosmos ecosystem enjoyer since early 2021, and deepened my participation after Osmosis DEX launched in June 2021. When DAI bridging to Cosmos became available earlier this year I was the first liquidity provider for both Gravity Bridge and Axelar Bridge DAI in the Cosmos, committing over 20k personal capital along with several thousand in fees for pool deployment. I successfully advocated (in a personal capacity) to add support for DAI pairs to Osmosis router and incentives schemes in the aftermath of Terra UST collapse (when the default course of action was to support just USDC). The OSMO/axlDAI LP now holds over $4 million TVL which is sufficient to make DAI a viable stablecoin and bridge asset within the Cosmos ecosystem. And there is an opportunity to expand DAI support to other platforms like Junoswap and Crescent DEX (which currently only support USDC). I didn\u2019t commit to actions on behalf of MakerDAO, internally discuss with other contributors, or use any Maker resources. But neither did I ask permission from the DAO to engage in discussions with 3rd parties. If MKR holders insist on contributors strictly adhering to narrowly defined mandates and not taking any other initiative to ensure \u201cpolitical neutrality\u201d, I don\u2019t think they will be pleased with the results (missed opportunities and declining market share). It is neither healthy nor sustainable for an organization to demand contributors should be \u201cseen but not heard\u201d. ",

If MKR holders insist on contributors strictly adhering to narrowly defined mandates and not taking any other initiative to ensure \u201cpolitical neutrality\u201d,   Monet, Thanks for the response here. The point here is that you did not collude and withhold information from the community, other MKR holders, or your peers. You had integrity in your interactions.This is a great point to discuss. Integrity as a Core Hiring Criterion Rather than narrowly define mandates, etc, Maker would be best to have a clear vision and strong leadership at the core unit facilitator level in addition to a system of checks and balances. The facilitators are tasked with hiring talent with strong ethical and moral foundations and the ability to help them deliver on the vision. When deceit happens, trust is weakened. Trust in a decentralized workforce is more important than a centralized workforce, since generally, core units are entrusted with more autonomy and fewer checks and balances than a standard hierarchy. Trust Requires Integrity The primary criticism of this \u201cgrowth task force group\u201d is that they have been deceitful in their actions. Deceit can come as either telling outright lies, or withholding relevant information. When trust is broken, the damage is often irreparable. The core units are entrusted to act in the best interest of the protocol and MKR holders at large. Yet, a portion of individual contributors colluded to act in what appears to be their own interest and withheld their engagements with large MKR holder from other MKR holders. They also withheld this information from their core unit peers, their core unit facilitators, and from the community at large. Growth Task force: Unofficially Official then turned \"informal community members\" The task force notes above they are operating as a stop gap official operations unit for Maker. After some time, they felt it necessary to disclose their activities beyond their mandates and ask for their new privileges to be explicitly codified and expanded in an MIP. What was not disclosed at that time was that they had been having numerous discussions with large MKR whales to redesign governance and remove checks and balances. They colluded to design and create a new centralized hierarchy that places them in the position of an executive committee, above their peers and possibly to the detriment of MKR holders. Again, this information was withheld from other core units, MKR holders, and the community. When it was clear the task force would be rejected. The narrative changed from the group as an executive operations unit to being \u201cinformal\u201d community members. This is again deceit because it fails to acknowledge what they themselves admitted:   their previous and ongoing role as a Maker \u201coperations\u201d unit and their current individual contributor roles which are paid. An individual contributor role comes with expectations of transparency.  (c.f. tweet) You only live once: Integrity or not, you decide. In the end, governance will not be able to defend against those who are willing to violate ethical boundaries for personal gain. This is an unfortunate reality. As Wouter noted above, what we can do is build systems that allow for discourse more openly. This helps to make these violations more clear and hopefully avoid back door centralization.  Right now, the lack of a system allows for plausible deniability, and the ability to claim business discussions are \u201cinformal\u201d and need not be disclosed to the community and peers. The community is generally not this gullible. Maker has legs: Why break the ethos that gave it success? Designing appropriate transparent structures can create alleviate the operational inefficiencies that led to centralization. We can avoid the loss of trust within the workforce; we need not slap a centralized hierarchy on a decentralized protocol and call it a day. It would be best to take a long and honest look at the two proposed structures, including the fact that Maker is a decentralized protocol that requires decentralization to maintain its resilience. Many of the core team have been here for a long time, and together with those before them, designed and produced the most resilient project on Ethereum. All of these individuals are geniuses. Maybe we should ask them what centralization or decentralization means for the protocol? It would make sense to move slowly and be weary of a new guard throwing this ethos to the wind in pursuit of short term profit and control. The old guard and ethos has delivered to us the most successful project on Ethereum. What has this other group produced to inspire confidence in their plan to centralize? This is a community. Not a corporation. ",
