Jordan Sutcliffe (@Jstar), BizDev Lead at StakeWise, on behalf of the StakeWise DAO. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. StakeWise is a liquid ETH2 staking platform that removes key barriers to entry, such as requiring 32 ETH and the expertise needed for maintaining staking infrastructure, allowing anyone to benefit from the rewards of the Beacon Chain. ETH deposits into the staking pool are tokenised into sETH2, representing users\u2019 interest-bearing (staked) capital. Staking rewards passively accrue in a separate token, rETH2 (note this application will focus solely on sETH2). As a liquid staking platform, users are free to un-stake at any time by trading their sETH2 back into ETH utilising the protocol\u2019s deep liquidity pools. sETH2 supply sits at 56,289 (~$200M), held by ~3k individual users. 3. Provide a brief history of the project.  Dmitri Tsumak (StakeWise Founder and CTO) first announced StakeWise was under development in April 2020. StakeWise launched on mainnet in March 2021, following a 9-month beta phase. StakeWise was the first staking pool to move to non-custodial staking (April 2021) and the protocol has since grown to over 70k ETH staked. In January 2022, the StakeWise Metro upgrade was announced, commencing the decentralisation of the protocol.  4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.  Site Docs sETH2 contract StakeWise dual tokenomics StakeWise Metro  5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. Audits - Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia 6. Link to any active communities relating to your project.  Forum Discord TG  7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? sETH2 tokens (ERC-20) represent a tokenised staking deposit into StakeWise\u2019s staking pool. sETH2 is consequently backed 1-to-1 with ETH held within validators. sETH2 acts like an interest-bearing form of wrapped ETH, providing holders with the right to a share of the staking pool rewards. These rewards are distributed in the form of rETH2. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? No - sETH2 is issued by the staking pool contract which is controlled by the StakeWise DAO (decentralized). 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? The main liquidity pool for sETH2 is on UniSwap (here). This pool has ~$170M TVL, consisting of ~25k ETH and ~26.5k sETH2. A second pool is currently being launched on Curve and is expected to be fully functional following a successful DAO vote by the end of the week. This pool will be seeded with 5k ETH of liquidity following a successful Tribe DAO vote, alongside other committed capital. I will provide updates on this pool as and when they occur. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. sETH2 currently uses a UniSwap TWAP oracle. Following the successful launch of this new Curve liquidity pool, we expect to upgrade the oracle to Chainlink over the coming months.  I am aware there is a proposal underway to upgrade the MIP6 template. In the section below, I have covered the proposed upgrades for this application to stay relevant following those changes: What type of asset is it? (e.g. store of value, currency, commodity, capital asset, governance token etc.) Staked ETH derivative token (100% collateralised). How is the asset used and does it give any rights to holders? (e.g. financial claims, dividends, governance rights) The main use-case currently is to simply hold the token within a wallet address. As the sETH2 utility grows, larger quantities of the token will be stored within smart contracts. Whether held within a wallet or a smart contract, sETH2 provides users with the rights to a percentage of the staking pool rewards. These rewards, rETH2, will continue to accrue in the designated user wallet, even if sETH2 is locked in a smart contract. Is the asset settled on chain (trustless) or off chain (trusted)? Is issuance of the asset decentralized (trustless) or centralized (trusted)? The asset is always settled in an on-chain, trustless fashion. The asset is always issued in a decentralized, trustless way. What is/are the expected use case(s) of the Dai generated by the vault? Long-term holders of ETH will often stake these assets to increase their overall returns. Generating Dai through sETH2 collateral will allow such users to unlock a percentage value of their staked ETH holdings for general spending purposes. More specific use-cases include: Trading, such as shorting an asset or taking a leveraged long position on ETH. Leverage ETH staking yields (deposit sETH2 collateral, borrow Dai, buy ETH and stake, for example). What is the amount of Dai expected to be generated against the collateral and what is the timeline? Is there a commitment on a minimum amount of Dai to be generated? Whilst we expect the utility of sETH2 to grow throughout the ecosystem, generating Dai through sETH2 will likely remain a tier 1 use-case of users\u2019 staked assets. Using today\u2019s sETH2 market cap, and an estimates 20% of sETH2 supply used to generate Dai, this would provide $17.5M Dai (250% collateralization). With the expected market cap growth of sETH2, especially with the Merge fast approaching, we would expect the amount of potential Dai generation to scale proportionally. There is no commitment in place currently on the minimum amount of Dai. What are the strategic benefits for MakerDAO in onboarding the collateral? ETH staking is fundamental to the network and staked ETH assets are expected to become more and more ubiquitous across the ecosystem as capital flows into the Beacon Chain. MakerDAO will directly benefit from the expected growth in staked ETH derivatives market following their whitelisting as eligible collateral. Is the asset, or asset balances, controlled by a central actor, or group of actors (e.g. through a multisig, or DAO)? Can the token implementation be upgraded/changed? If so, what is the process and what stakeholders are involved? The StakeWise smart contracts control sETH2 issuance. These smart contracts can only be changed following a successful DAO vote. The DAO is community owned and all voting rights fall to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token. Does the token have whitelist or blacklist functions? If so, what is the process for utilization and what stakeholders are involved? StakeWise has recently announced a partnership with Blockdaemon to launch an institutional liquid staking protocol. This protocol will be fully licensed and allow only whitelisted/KYC\u2019d addresses to interact with it. It is important to note that this new institutional protocol will be a fork of StakeWise, ring-fencing permissioned capital away from the current permissionless protocol. StakeWise is first and foremost a DAO and a permissionless platform, with no whitelisting currently operating, or expected to operate, on sETH2. Does the token contain rebasing logic? No - given the dual token model of StakeWise, sETH2 acts as a static price, static balance token, pegged 1-to-1 with ETH. Many thanks for taking the time to read through this application. I welcome the MakerDAO community to provide comments and I will remain active to address any questions/concerns. I would be more than happy to discuss this proposal on a community call should there be interest to do so. ",

I agree, peg stability is a key component. Here is a chart comparing our token to Lido\u2019s for the past ~8 months:  1269\u00d7417 65.8 KB  As you can see, sETH2 has shown great peg stability and is practically indistinguishable to stETH. We are using concentrated liquidity on UniSwap V3 which has proven to be very efficient. The main difference in price right now between sETH2 and stETH is the fact we are currently using a 0.3% fee tier in our Uni pool. Adjusting for that commission, we have a tighter peg to ETH than Lido. Our community has shown strong interest in reducing this commission to 0.01% which will close the final \u2018gap\u2019 between sETH2 and ETH. We also expect this stability of sETH2 to improve further as our new Curve liquidity pool TVL grows. Thank you for sharing the Arthur Hayes write-up! ",

MightyOx:  what differentiates StakeWise and sETH2 from other liquid-staked ETH options to attract, grow and support a stable userbase?   A unique feature of StakeWise is the dual tokenomics: separating staked ETH capital and staking rewards into two different tokens, sETH2 and rETH2, respectively. This has proven to be very effective, providing the highest native staking yields alongside the ability to re-invest, and consequently compound, staking rewards. ",

                    "content": "As defined in the Technical Assessment shared last week, the technical risk is classified as HIGH. The reasons for this classification are summarized in the Contract Risk Summary section. By reviewing the MIP6 Recommended Guideline Metrics for Onchain Collateral Onboarding, we can see that the current total market cap for sETH2 is $125M which is significantly below the minimum market cap recommended, meaning it is unlikely to result in the recommended 30M Dai generated. This coupled with the fact that onboarding this collateral type would require additional technical work, which will increase the upfront cost, makes it very likely to be a net negative investment for MakerDAO under current market conditions. This makes the opportunity cost of onboarding this collateral vs. others in the pipeline a compelling reason to shift focus away from this opportunity. Domain Teams composed of CES, RISK and ORACLE CUs agree that the technical risks need to be mitigated before we continue with performing the remaining onboarding activities. We have set this collateral application as Postponed in the CSI sheet. We encourage the applicant (@Jstar) to share new updates once these mitigations are in place and at that moment we will review the application accordingly regarding market conditions as specified in the Recommended Guidelines Metrics.

                    "content": "StakeWise announced a major upgrade yesterday which is relevant for the planned sETH2 integration. StakeWise is undergoing a major upgrade and will soon transition to a fully permissionless protocol in a new model for liquid staking. The main goal is to combat the current centralisation we see on the Beacon Chain. Full details of the announcement can be found here, but to quickly summarise the relevant points for our integration:  StakeWise will be transitioning from the current dual token model to a single token model. The integration plans for sETH2 are consequently on hold during this transition phase as we will look to make osETH (overcollateralised staked ETH) the main staked ETH token going forward. A robust roadmap is in place to ensure an efficient transition to the new staked ETH token alongside the necessary liquidity requirements for integrations such as Maker. The upgrade brings major changes to StakeWise, such as the introduction of permissionless node operators. Whilst the motivation for adding StakeWise\u2019s staked ETH to Maker still remains, many of the items detailed in the proposal above will change. Given this, a fresh proposal will be submitted nearer the token transition date, alongside a new greenlight vote.  osETH will be the first of its kind and will set a new benchmark for both security (through its in-built slashing protection) and decentralisation for staked ETH tokens. We look forward to the launch of StakeWise V3 and the ability to bring ETH staking diversity to Maker in the very near future. ",

StraitsX \u2013 Issuers of XSGD, a Singapore-dollar backed stablecoin that is fully fiat collateralised.  Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  StraitsX is the pioneering payments infrastructure for digital assets space in Southeast Asia developed by Xfers. StraitsX offers personal and business accounts to deposit, hold and withdraw funds through wire transfers and the Singapore Dollar-backed stablecoin, XSGD. Business accounts can also access B2B API-enabled payments rails enabling instantaneous settlement for funds collection and disbursements. StraitsX currently provides the Singapore Dollar payment infrastructure for 12 digital assets platforms including Gemini, Crypto.com, Liquid Exchange, Zipmex, CEX.IO, Indodax among many others. StraitsX is the issuer of XSGD, the first and only fully collateralized Singapore Dollar stablecoin, powered by open-source blockchain protocols. Launched in October 2020, the StraitsX Singapore Dollar (XSGD) is backed 1:1 with the Singapore Dollar (SGD) and issued by Xfers, which holds a Major Payment Institution license by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Beyond XSGD, the StraitsX team has also launched XIDR, a fully collateralized Indonesia Rupiah stablecoin, launched in November 2021. Any users who own XSGD will own the underlying fiat, held in custody by Xfers Pte Ltd.  How long has the project been live in production?  The first XSGD tokens were minted in April 2020. The public release occurred in October 2020.  Provide a brief history of the project.   1600\u00d7909 257 KB  The first XSGD was minted in April 2020 and was subsequently launched in October 2020. XSGD has seen exponential growth since it launched, having achieved $1 billion in on-chain transactions with the first $100 million achieved in its first 5 months. In September 2021, StraitsX was the finalist for the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s Global Central Bank Digital Currency whereby we proposed a hybrid CBDC model leveraging on layer-2 solutions with Zero Knowledge Proof using the Aztec protocol to ensure scalability, privacy, and performance. Having seen the success of our stablecoin in Singapore, we launched XIDR in Indonesia in November 2021 with the aim of being the dominant stablecoin issuer in Southeast Asia. Leveraging on our natively issued stablecoins (XSGD and XIDR), we launched our stablecoin OTC desk where we enable users to swap stablecoins pegged to their local currency to USD-backed stablecoin. To date, we have over $3.7B in on-chain transactions with a market capitalization of over $250M USD at its peak. Supported blockchains XSGD is available on both Ethereum (as an ERC-20 Token) and Zilliqa (as a ZRC-2 Token) blockchain protocols with 3 other blockchains in the pipeline, scheduled to be supported by the end of the year. XSGD has seen tremendous progress since its inception in 2020 and it is currently the largest stablecoin by market capitalization issued from Asia Pacific and one of the largest non-USD backed stablecoins in the world.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.   StraitsX Website Whitepaper Source Code Attestation report  Asset Information  What type of asset is it? (e.g. store of value, currency, commodity, capital asset, governance token etc.)  XSGD is a stablecoin that is backed 1:1 with the Singapore Dollar (SGD). Reserve Management While all stablecoins aim for price stability, the mechanisms by which they achieve such stability are not necessarily created equal. XSGD\u2019s stability stems from a strong combination of StraitsX holding fiat money in its reserve for an amount equivalent to the number of tokens in circulation, one-for-one convertibility, availability, short settlement time, daily internal reconciliations, as well as a solid compliance infrastructure that operate together to create a digital token that represents one Singapore Dollar.  How is the asset used and does it give any rights to holders? (e.g. financial claims, dividends, governance rights)  Minting XSGD can be done directly through the StraitsX platform. Users will be required to first top up their StraitsX Account with Singapore Dollar (SGD). Once funds are available in the account, a user may initiate a withdrawal for the desired amount of XSGD tokens. Minting and transfers through this channel will be processed every business day by the StraitsX team thus ensuring T+1 settlement.  What is the market cap for the asset?  XSGD is listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and the latest information on market data can be found on the StraitsX website.  Market capitalization (USD): $150,663,889 Total on-chain transactions: $3,690,151,946   Where does exchange for the asset occur? A. Provide exchange data on market liquidity, volume and order book depth.  Exchanges XSGD is supported on:  Liquid Tokenize Coinut CEX.io Crypto.com Indodax UniSwap DFX Finance ZILSwap XCAD  Total exchange volume (24hour): $3,685,668 Weighted average order book depth:  $1,036,233 (+2% depth) $1,700,543 (-2% depth)   Is the asset settled on chain (trustless) or off chain (trusted)?  The asset is settled off chain through the StraitsX personal or business account.  If offchain (trusted) settlement: describe what are the involved entities, process and estimated time  Minting XSGD can be done directly through the StraitsX platform. Users will be required to first top up their StraitsX Account with Singapore Dollar (SGD). Once funds are available in the account, a user may initiate a withdrawal for the desired amount of XSGD tokens. Minting and transfers through this channel will be processed every business day by the StraitsX team thus ensuring T+1 settlement. Similarly, XSGD can be redeemed by depositing XSGD into the StraitsX personal and business account, followed by withdrawing it out to a user\u2019s bank account. This process takes 90 minutes for a user to receive their funds.  List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed collateral type.  XSGD can rely on the price oracle from the SGD/USD rate found here.  List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed collateral type.  NA Business Questions  What is/are the expected use case(s) of the Dai generated by the vault?  Use case #1: Dai generation XSGD is currently one of the largest non-USD backed stablecoins in the world and as the XSGD ecosystem expands into industries such as DeFi, Payments, and Remittance. We expect generating Dai through XSGD to be the main use case of staked assets. Based on XSGD\u2019s existing market capitalization of over $150M USD, we expect 20% of our existing XSGD supply to be used to generate Dai. Use case #2: Arbitrage opportunities for traders XSGD is currently supported on various DEX and CEX and this provides arbitrage opportunities for traders to swap between XSGD and Dai across CEX and DEX which results in higher trading volume and utilization of Dai. While the USD denominated pairs have a tight spread across CEX and DEX, non-USD stablecoin pairs such as XSGD presents a greater opportunity for traders to arbitrage across various XSGD/Dai pairs on DEX such as 1inch, UniSwap, and SushiSwap. Use case #3: Alternative stablecoin to access DeFi markets StraitsX has an existing user base of over 250K+ personal users and 1000+ business accounts, which comprises both small and medium enterprise as well as large institutional traders. USDC and USDT has been the main top up method for users looking to access DeFi markets and with XSGD as a supported collateral of Dai, this could enable our existing users an alternative top up method into DeFi markets with their XSGD. Use case #4: OTC desk StraitsX has a stablecoin OTC desk that enables users to swap between XSGD and other USD backed stablecoins such as BUSD, USDC, and USDP. We have seen increased demand from counterparties to support other forms of stablecoins such as Dai to be supported on our OTC desk and we expect the Dai generated by the vault to contribute to our OTC trading volume.  What is the amount of Dai expected to be generated against the collateral and what is the timeline? Is there a commitment on a minimum amount of Dai to be generated?  In the scenario of a Dai 30m vault, the minimum commitment of Dai to be generated would be 30m.  What are the strategic benefits for MakerDAO in onboarding the collateral?  Benefits for MakerDao  With most active stablecoins currently denominated in USD, StraitsX believes that this state is not representative of users\u2019 ultimate preferences but rather due to a lack of trusted and compliant alternatives denominated in other fiat currencies. With Singapore ranked consistently as one of the world\u2019s easiest places to do business by the World Bank, StraitsX believes that there is a desire for businesses in Asia and beyond to transact in a Singapore Dollar denominated stablecoin. XSGD presents an opportunity for users to hedge the Singapore Dollar against other assets and reduce their reliance on USD-denominated stablecoins By enabling collateral through XSGD, MakerDao can gain access to one of the largest economies in the world through the StraitsX existing user base of over 250K+ personal users and 1000+ business accounts, which comprises both small and medium enterprise in Singapore as well as large institutional traders. In addition, StraitsX is part of the Fazz Financial group which provides B2B/B2C fintech services across Singapore and Indonesia. We have a card issuance team focused on building out a debit card for businesses and would be keen to explore supporting Dai as a supported currency on our cards. Having seen great success with stablecoin backed liquidity pools across DEX such as DFX and UniSwap, we are exploring the possibility of launching a XSGD/Dai pool to meet with the increased demand for Dai from existing XSGD holders. Being a payment infrastructure provider, we work with a number of yield generating crypto companies that look to generate yield from the XSGD collected from their end user. We would be keen to explore with existing partners to collateralise XSGD on MakerDao to generate Dai which can be deployed on Oasis to generate yield for their end user.  XSGD Ecosystem As of April 2022, XSGD is strategically supported by a versatile ecosystem of 30+ digital asset platforms ranging from non-custodial wallets to institutional custody solutions, exchanges, DeFi platforms, and Blockchain analytics tools.

Based on XSGD\u2019s existing market capitalization of over $150M USD, we expect 20% of our existing XSGD supply to be used to generate Dai.   I\u2019m not sure why we should expect 20% of XSGD supply to be deposited into a vault in order to generate DAI. This seems extremely optimistic given that the collateral is a stablecoin pegged to a different currency.     rdsx:  In the scenario of a Dai 30m vault, the minimum commitment of Dai to be generated would be 30m.   I don\u2019t think that answers the question. While it would be nice to have non-USD stablecoins backing DAI, it seems unlikely that the oracle costs can be covered by the stability fees. ",

Personally, I would like to see the dependence on stable currencies in the system to be reduced. ",

On UniSwap, we have over $1.46M in TVL with a 24 hr trading volume of $143K and have deployed liquidity pools for trading pairs such as USDC and wBTC. Similarly on DFX, we have over $7.6M in TVL with a monthly volume of $7.3M. As a stablecoin issuer, we aim to provide deep liquidity across DEX and CEX to ensure minimal slippage and a competitive rate even with large volumes.

                    "content": "I think there is a theoretical source of demand from people looking to pursue carry trades (pledge XSGD, borrow DAI, deposit in defi for yield) or hedge currency risk vs their home currency. But with USD overnight rates currently higher than comparable SGD rates, it seems like the more appropriate trade would be to use SGD as the funding currency (borrow XSGD, sell for DAI and earn USD yields). DAI borrowing would be sort of the reverse of this so would imply a carrying cost/opportunity cost. I think a pooled money market / D3M style mechanism may be more suitable than a vault, as users would be able to recapture some of this with interest earned on their XSGD collateral from borrowers. Generally I still think XSGD is worth further investigation but might not be worth onboarding now given relatively low defi liquidity and usage. ",
