It\u2019s just that for this particular week we already have an active poll for a SF increase, so I imagine an executive overriding that would be somewhat controversial.  Also, the SF increase isn\u2019t as time sensitive as the DC increase, since that is ~30 million DAI away, and I think Curve should be able to absorb ~200 million DAI before the peg dips.  And that might very well happen soon, but we could package a SF increase with another DC increase if needed ",
