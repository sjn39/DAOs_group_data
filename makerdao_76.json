Vamsi is a long time MakerDAO participant and formerly a member of the Maker Foundation Integration Engineering team as a Senior Integrations Engineer. He has assisted a large group of external partner companies to integrate with the Maker suite of products. Vamsi has been studying fixed rates in DeFi and the need for rate stability since the first signs of rate volatility within Single-Collateral Dai in 2018. He initially designed a product to provide stability to the Dai Savings Rate (DSR). Since then, he has focused on the market need of a fixed rate vault product, and as a result designed the core Deco smart contract to function seamlessly with Maker. The purpose of the Deco core unit is to increase Maker\u2019s competitiveness in the market, retain vault owners, attract new vault owners, and stabilize the Maker revenue stream. Vamsi has done extensive work in the past to help partners better understand risks around emergency shutdown and is motivated to reduce external dependencies and third-party protocol risk. Deco and its core unit achieve this by empowering Maker Governance, in collaboration with the existing Core Units, to effectively manage fixed rate product offerings. Vamsi is deeply invested in the success of both Maker and the proposed Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit as the author of the white paper, whitepaper, and the designer and architect of the Deco Protocol. Vamsi is the author of the technical documentation and the Codebase repo of the base protocol implementation on Github. Core Unit ID DECO-001 Core Unit Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit.

Reimbursement of All Payment to Deco.\tDeco will reimburse/credit to Maker in Dai all payments before receiving Revenue Share. Maker will pay to Deco 15% of the revenue from the Fixed-Rate CLAIM_FEE token sales only AFTER it has reimbursed the Deco Core Unit, and DecoM operating expenses, advanced by Maker, and any MKR distributions which are to be valued in Dai as of the date of acceptance and approval by Executive Vote Pass and to be utilized through December 1, 2024.
