                    "content": "Hello community, I think the 4% criteria makes some sense, so that the whales cannot skew the system by making multiple wallets. I recommend a more community driven approach to solve this issue by opening delegation option to vote \u2019yes\u2019 to reach quorum, with an added option of having a threshold of at least 1600 UNI tokens. That is 0.004 % of  4% criteria that is in place. This will in turn bring more power to the community and would be less discriminatory.
