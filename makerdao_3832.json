The picture came first in a totally unrelated conversation to crypto. I saw the \u201cmonkey\u201d in the photo and decided to add \u201cIrish\u201d to it\u2026after having a couple of beers. It seemed fitting. I did a few checks and found I could use it just about everywhere without modification. Only after the fact did I realize the monkey was displaying a \" Sign of the horns\" hand gesture. In Hatha Yoga, it has a meaning of \u201crejuvenate the body\u201d. In Buddhism, it means to expel demons, remove negative energy, and ward off evil. That\u2019s the one I\u2019m going with. Back off evil collateral, Monkey.Irish is on the job!  ",
