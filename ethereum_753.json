His first comment to us was \u201coh you\u2019re one of the few running one of those big, scary nodes.\u201d We asked him if he knew of anyone else running a \u201cbig, scary node\u201d to see if we could possibly sync with them. He knew of no one, not even the Ethereum Foundation keeps a full archival copy of the Ethereum chain.  It highlights an education-related issue that I see. We need entry points for users of various kinds so that they know where to start, where to bring problems up. This person does not even seem to be aware of the Data Ring. ",

And, of course, the interaction with VB sounds like a fabrication. But back to your point \u2013 this is a commercial company. I think messaging / education / entry points for commercial companies could be VERY interesting. We want to welcome them and onboard them as open source contributors \u2013 or make it clear who they can pay for help. For example, I wonder if they are running Geth or Parity. For the Geth team, might they list trusted consultants who do paid work? Who would pay an affiliate fee? For Parity, they should add a paid support option right in their repo. ",
