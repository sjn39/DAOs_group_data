                    "content": "For SIXS, the SC team published MIP21 in Kovan last week. So the bottleneck is the legal side as @mrabino1 explained well. Then the review might take some time. The Real-World Finance team will probably stop everything to focus on that when it\u2019s ready. For NS-DROP, SC team has started to work on MIP22. With MIP21 out of the way (soon) they go into the meaty piece. Nevertheless, Liquidation 2.0 remains the priority. There will be a weekly point with @hexonaut. @prankstr25 is on fire and the New Silver pool has already $1.5M AUM and 5 investments. The deal flow is here waiting for Maker. I will not give a deadline sadly, there are too many parties involved. Those 2 projects are game-changers and we can be happy to have those partners. If all goes well on an operational side, this will lead to projects like SolarX (solar farms) (trust/MIP21 based followed by @Philinje ) and a lot of Centrifuge assets that will provide great diversification. For instance, we are making great progress with People\u2019s Company (farmlands) (Centrifuge followed by @jameskmccall). Farming the sun and farming the land. If you want to go overseas, @williamr is all-in on trade finance with ConsolFreight and Harbor Trade Credit, both are Centrifuge MIP22-based. The RWF team can\u2019t wait. This is the future of DeFi.
