I like posting here and I\u2019m not gonna turn down free money but I\u2019d probably contribute exactly the same way even if I received 10 DAI a month or 100 DAI a month. Small amounts as a thank you gesture are sometimes better. There is a point where the community growth and participation becomes inorganic and it becomes tempting to post without adding real value, just to earn DAI. It\u2019s only my opinion but I think the current amount is too high but given that the community will grow, this problem should sort itself out in the coming months. ",

Full disclosure, I work closely with the SourceCred team through GovAlpha and have helped with some of the recent weight changes so take my enthusiasm for the program with a grain of salt. SourceCred was the thing that took my interest in Maker from a intellectual curiosity to an incentivized reason to come back everyday, and while 5 months later the SourceCred payments don\u2019t matter to me nearly as much as they did at the beginning, it was still a large reason why I was able to take the time to become a paid contributor. Additionally, while the DAI amount is no longer as material to me, every month I still look at my SourceCred payment compared to the previous month. I\u2019m engaging a lot more this month because my last payment was smaller which got me to reflect on how much time I\u2019ve been spending collaborating in meetings rather than publicly on the forum. As far as Governance issues with SourceCred, it\u2019s pretty clear the data has a lot of value. How much we want to pay people to participate is a bit trickier of a question, but objectively we want to pay enough to encourage repeat contributions and not enough to encourage malicious attacks. IMO we could easily double the payments without upsetting the balance, and the move would be a great excuse to team up with Marketing and really promote the DAO. Like it\u2019s pretty revolutionary that all you have to do here to get paid is show up with some reasonable ideas. How many more talented individuals would we attract if they knew their time would be valued from the moment they created an account? ",

But I agree, there should be a way to use SourceCred to give MKR to the people participating in Governance. One interesting idea is that you can always run \u201cone-time\u201d data sets via the SourceCred algorithm where you apply a special waiting (maybe we boost all posts in the Governance category for instance) and do a distribution from those numbers. Since it would be one time that takes out the currency risk, and it wouldn\u2019t be as hard to find an agreement for the single distribution (minting vs buying) in the community. It\u2019s an \u201cunnecessary\u201d expenditure for sure, but I think getting MKR into the hands of people that care about the protocol is a great way to add to the expected longevity. ",

So, yes incentives matter and I think we can grow this community a lot more by increasing the rewards and possibly adding Discord. ",

So I get to pay taxes on income just to drop kick it back to miners to vote.   SC rewards not really enough to buy MKR and then pay fees to stuff it into governance. One thing I would like to see be done is to perhaps make these SC and other DAI payments on a sidechain like xDAI or at least an opt in to payments on X side chain choice.   Not entirely sure what SC costs/month in ETH to distribute and whether that would compare to bridging and distributing but as L1 costs continue to increase something to think about.    This would also allow for a lower barrier to distribution and possibly higher participation. ",

I agree with this.   For example we could also vote to cease SC rewards altogether for the next 1-3 months and see if it changes community engagement at all.    I have limited my own engagement here for a number of reasons.  Upping SC rewards won\u2019t get more, and decreasing them may only get marginally less.   I am here because I have vested interests, both owning MKR, and also having a vault with significant capital, and DAI.    I also am convinced the way Maker goes (if there is some bad event) it will take the whole DeFI ecosystem for what could be a terrible ride.   So I am not just here for my own vested interests but to help support the entire crypto ecosystem. Honestly come to think that while discussion and input (particularly from people with significant experience) have value, over time it looks like implementation has a much higher value than input with experience.   It is very easy to see people like @hexonaut or @Primoz  who take ideas and put them into code are 10x more valuable than anyone else imo. SC rewards probably are not going to get us more implementations, and likely only gets Maker more ideas that it can\u2019t easily implement.   Which is a reason \u2018not\u2019 to increase SC rewards, and to take that money to hire more smart contract coders, debuggers, auditors, etc.    20K DAI/month more than sufficient to hire 1 very experienced smart contract writer, or experienced auditor and I honestly think we need that more than 20x voices in forums bantering ideas around. Fortunately or unfortunately governance is a plurality of voices vs. a few so these choices are made as a collective. As to:     AstronautThis:  I would imagine it\u2019s a lot better to explicitly reimburse you for such protocol-related actions because those are clearly for the benefit of the protocol. That should of course be unrelated to SourceCred rewards.   One thing that I think is interesting with respect to increasing SC rewards is an idea that people posting here should also have some minimum MKR stake, and governance participation as a kind of multiplier regarding rewards in general (SC, governance, etc.).

One thing we already doubled rewards and it is my own impression that there wasn\u2019t too much change.  We do have some new posters here like yourself @AstronautThis with new views and input which is appreciated, but I think a general poll as to why people post here might be in order.  I mean honestly rather than just increase rewards hoping for more participation (what does that mean really in terms of community growth - support - actual change) perhaps a view towards what the real community goals are? Do we want more participation by people who own and vote MKR in governance?  Do we just want more forum posts?  Perhaps we just want more people around who might be able to do work or to be hired?  Or maybe we just want to focus on the tasks at hand that still need to be done? These all seem to be valid topics of discussion.   What I am wondering is if we got a report on whether the last doubling of SC rewards really made a measurable change in \u2018participation\u2019 and what that means for the goals of the community?

It is my long-term view that SourceCred should serve off-chain governance in a similar way that Staking Rewards serve on-chain governance. Practically-speaking, it should seek to incentivize and reward an expertise-driven culture, where quality input is appreciated. I\u2019ve been running \u2018SourceCred Outreach\u2019 for over a month now. Its aim is to identify promising community members and point them towards SourceCred. Now, whether they see the resulting DAI as a small gesture of appreciation (most likely) or it actually improves their financial situation, I believe it might have played a role in encouraging several of our outstanding new contributors, e.g., @Aes, @PaperImperium or @aburban90. From my experience, I believe the community-building aspect of SourceCred is just as important in the long run as any financial payouts. For this reason, I\u2019m not stressed about increasing the payouts as the outcomes are positive regardless of that. One important factor speaking against an increase is the rising incentive to game the system. As much as we\u2019re prepared to handle additional moderation duties, the relatively-lower payouts are a natural defense against manipulations of the system and/or damage to merit-driven discussion culture.

Below is some additional context re: SoruceCred\u2019s relationship with the DAO, as it relates to this change, as well as inline responses to objections and proposed ideas. SourceCred Working Group \u2192 GovAlpha CU SourceCred has been receiving a 5k DAI/mo dev grant from the Foundation for prioritized support and development of new features. This grant program was sunsetted at the end of March. So, as @LongForWisdom mentioned, the GovAlpha Core Unit (CU) has taken over paying SourceCred. For transparency, while we have not yet implemented it, SourceCred has proposed (and GovAlpha agreed to) switching from the 5k DAI/month flat amount to SourceCred\u2019s preferred tithing model (used by SourceCred\u2019s other partners), whereby SourceCred receives 5% of the Cred and DAI distributed. In addition, I will be paid 2k DAI/month to continue providing priority support for Maker\u2019s instance, as well as opting myself into payouts, as is standard practice in SourceCred\u2019s other partner communities. At current distribution levels (~20k DAI/mo), Maker would be paying roughly ~2,500 less per month than under the previous arrangement. If distribution was doubled to ~40k DAI, month, SourceCred\u2019s tithe would equal ~2k DAI/mo, and total cost would likely be around 4.5-5k DAI/mo. While there is some potential for conflict of interest here, SourceCred believes the tithe is the best way to align incentives. If Maker decides to increase the payouts, here or on other platforms, its costs will likely increase as well. SourceCred community members contributing in partner communities are paid via SourceCred (and vice versa), and we haven\u2019t seen any issues with that yet. On a personal note, I also requested to be opted into payouts so I would be incentivized to contribute here more. The discourse on here is great, and I\u2019d like to post more on issues related to SourceCred, as well as decentralized governance, etc. Governance of SourceCred parameters Thus far, parameter changes such as increasing the distribution amounts, changing the payout formula, and tweaks to the algorithm have been decided by the SourceCred working group, which is now under the GovAlpha Core Unit (CU). Eventually, the plan is for the governance community to make these decisions.     iammeeoh:      AstronautThis:  Does this approval eventually require an on-chain poll?   It definitely should, since we are talking about money coming from the Maker protocol fees.   Since the budget for SourceCred is currently under the GovAlpha budget, if MKR holders were unhappy with SourceCred, they could defund it. As @prose11 noted, this arrangement limits how quickly we can increase distribution amounts. The Parameter Proposals Group they suggest seems reasonable to me as well. I will leave it to the community and facilitators to determine proper polls, Signal Requests, etc. Gaming     Elihu:  One important factor speaking against an increase is the rising incentive to game the system. As much as we\u2019re prepared to handle additional moderation duties, the relatively-lower payouts are a natural defense against manipulations of the system and/or damage to merit-driven discussion culture.   While this is certainly a concern, I think we could double payouts without too much risk of extra gaming. In part because of mitigation strategies such as trust level-based minting, a feature SourceCred built for Maker, and the 10 DAI minimum to receive on-chain payouts. It is also just very time-consuming for new accounts to begin accruing enough Cred to collude effectively, due to strong moderation on the forum and the high barrier to entry to meaningfully participate in Maker governance . This could be mitigated further if only certain high-context contributions (e.g. governance actions) are paid more. One thing I have seen is an uptick in brand new accounts opting in to SourceCred with no activity or likes. Some of which never post. My guess is they\u2019re fishing for airdrops. However, they never receive on-chain payouts, and those ETH addresses aren\u2019t currently stored anywhere in the instance. Keeping an eye on it. Optimal pay This one is tricky. The Maker community is very diverse. For some the payouts are pocket change, not enough to change behavior. For others, it\u2019s a meaningful, potentially life-changing amount. People also assign different meaning to the payouts. I am a little surprised at people thinking they\u2019re overpaid.     AstronautThis:  I\u2019m relatively new here but I was surprised at how much DAI I received last month. Personally, I think SourceCred overpays casual community members like me. I like posting here and I\u2019m not gonna turn down free money but I\u2019d probably contribute exactly the same way even if I received 10 DAI a month or 100 DAI a month. Small amounts as a thank you gesture are sometimes better. There is a point where the community growth and participation becomes inorganic and it becomes tempting to post without adding real value, just to earn DAI.       ultraschuppi:  Voted no despite being on the top10 sourcecred payouts in the last months. Reason: I don\u2019t feel I have been contributing that much to the forum, mostly doing chores like taking care of DCs, signaling and working in the Rates Group / MakerDao Open Market Committee. I always feel a bit dirty when I receive my payouts. Imho we should rather do more with grants or put people on the payroll of CUs (like Risk and Governance is already doing it) than just using an algorithm to pay people. This can (and will be!) easily gamed and having more SourceCred payments is just increasing this risk.   I have specifically thought @ultraschuppi and @AstronautThis were if anything underpaid   Ultrachuppi because they do governance tasks we want to incentivize generally (MIPS, Signal Requests, etc.). AstronautThis because they\u2019re a newcomer that has been consistently racking up Cred (recruitment is a goal of SourceCred). I think they may be undervaluing their contributions. I do however think a danger of doubling payouts would be to increase the number of people that think they are overpaid. I fear the system loses legitimacy if it is perceived to be way overpaying (which it may well be in some cases). My personal feel is that the amounts are about right for most contributions. However, I think there are contributions and contributors that are underpaid, in which case an increase in payouts could be a useful experiment. SourceCred can be configured to selectively value certain types of contributions higher. Which contributions will depend on what SoruceCred is good at incentivizing (and what it is not), and what the community thinks SourceCred should incentivize more (or less). Headed to sleep here, but returning tomorrow to address ideas around incentives and some valid arguments against an increase. ",

                    "content": "Reply continued\u2026 Before diving into concerns and ideas, I think it\u2019s useful to ask the question, what goals of the DAO is SourceCred furthering? I\u2019m seeing a number of different perspectives here. Is it a tool to retain and expand the community?     mrabino1:      flipflopflapdelegate:  RETAIN the community participation   Retain and expand!   In my observations of SourceCred in the wild, it does increase engagement. At the end of Maker\u2019s first 3 months trialing SourceCred, engagement metrics were up, as detailed our final report. Below is a chart of Cred over time (a proxy for work) since Maker began using SourceCred in June 2020. While correlation does not equal causation, engagement appears to be on a general uptrend.  image1804\u00d71118 99.4 KB  SourceCred also appears to have been a factor in several community members deepening their committment and taking on more formal roles in the DAO.     prose11:  SourceCred was the thing that took my interest in Maker from a intellectual curiosity to an incentivized reason to come back everyday, and while 5 months later the SourceCred payments don\u2019t matter to me nearly as much as they did at the beginning, it was still a large reason why I was able to take the time to become a paid contributor. Additionally, while the DAI amount is no longer as material to me, every month I still look at my SourceCred payment compared to the previous month. I\u2019m engaging a lot more this month because my last payment was smaller which got me to reflect on how much time I\u2019ve been spending collaborating in meetings rather than publicly on the forum.   I have opted out several community members from payments because they took on paid positions in the Foundation/Core Units, such as @hexonaut, @SebVentures and @juan. Did SourceCred help pull them in? Curious if they have reflections. For some, it provides a sense of belonging.     iammeeoh:  It\u2019s mostly psychological in my opinion. I get sense of \u201creward\u201d from the Cred payments, well beyond the monetary value. In my case, it has significantly strengthen my feeling of \u201cbelonging to the MKR community\u201d in a productive way.   And consistent engagement over time is key to that.     flipflopflapdelegate:  It\u2019s because of people like you and the other Community Members that I wake up every morning and the first thing I check is this Forum and the Maker Rocket Chat. Every bit of your participating helps shape & build this DAO.   Is it a competitive advantage? It seems so.     ejbarraza:  I voted YES because I think it is important to compensate people for their time and valuable contributions. Even though I have been working way more overtime the past 3 months I have made it a point to continue to check in on this protocol and it is partly because of the SourceCred. I have completely stopped following other protocols like Yearn because I simply do not have the time and it will not produce any rewards. So, yes incentives matter and I think we can grow this community a lot more by increasing the rewards and possibly adding Discord.   I have seen similar anecdotal evidence elsewhere. Not just in communities using SourceCred, but also on Reddit subs I frequent, such as r/ethtrader and r/CryptoCurrency, which are distributing ERC-20s based on karma (a reputation system similar to SourceCred in some ways). I regularly see people on these subs report that they spend more time posting there because they can get paid, at the expense of subs that don\u2019t pay. I asked to be opted in, in part because I could feel the opportunity cost, and want to be incentivized to post more. Does it advance specific goals of the DAO? Here, it appears there is room for improvement.     zenithlight:  Is it true that we are currently underrewarding the type of work that happens in the forums? There is certainly some very important work that happens in the forums (like risk analysis and new MIPS) but I am not sure those are proportionately rewarded by SourceCred. Unilaterally increasing SC rewards will mean we get more of what we already get, which is mostly opinionated discussion. If that is what we want then so be it, but more opinionated discussion on its own does not result in consensus.   Even a contributor doing actions we\u2019re looking to incentivize is skeptical.     ultraschuppi:  Voted no despite being on the top10 sourcecred payouts in the last months. Reason: I don\u2019t feel I have been contributing that much to the forum, mostly doing chores like taking care of DCs, signaling and working in the Rates Group / MakerDao Open Market Committee. I always feel a bit dirty when I receive my payouts. Imho we should rather do more with grants or put people on the payroll of CUs (like Risk and Governance is already doing it) than just using an algorithm to pay people. This can (and will be!) easily gamed and having more SourceCred payments is just increasing this risk.   I would argue that community for its own sake is valuable. Indeed, in the rapidly evolving DeFi space, community is increasingly viewed as a competitive moat. Anyone can fork a protocol and offer financial incentives. If all you offer is yield farming, you can always be outbid. It\u2019s very difficult to fork real community. Also, I\u2019ve noticed that this forum has become something of a \u2018stage\u2019. It\u2019s well trafficed. Crypto famous occasionally drop in to opine. Reporters are here. I\u2019ve seen Cointelegrah articles in recent months that were clearly just a recap of a post here. That is presumably good for Maker\u2019s brand. Is it just the morally correct thing to do?     FourthStreet:  Give credit where credit is due. Quality posts are valuable and should be rewarded to the fullest extent the DAO is able. This community has so many bright minds. I love reading the forums to see all the dialogue every couple days.   I\u2019ll leave it for the reader to decide (there are good arguments against paying too). However, I do see a general desire among crypto projects to reward its community members, especially when large sums of money are being made. And there aren\u2019t any mechanisms I know of that are as credibly neutral or automated as SourceCred. In summary, I think SourceCred is all of these things and more. It\u2019s expressive enough to capture a lot complexity and nuance, even with its blind spots. Sometimes I wonder if SourceCred is just automating Maker\u2019s internal political economy   image494\u00d7566 69.5 KB  However, SourceCred is still relatively young, and has downsides and risks as well. I also think Maker has created a very unique, strong community (could do a whole separate post on that), and don\u2019t want SourceCred to interfere with that, only strengthen and grow it. I would recommend Maker moving \u201cat the speed of trust\u201d, as we\u2019re fond of saying in SourceCred. Below I address some concerns and ideas, in the spirit of that  Concerns     MakerMan:  Upping SC rewards won\u2019t get more, and decreasing them may only get marginally less. I am here because I have vested interests, both owning MKR, and also having a vault with significant capital, and DAI. I also am convinced the way Maker goes (if there is some bad event) it will take the whole DeFI ecosystem for what could be a terrible ride. So I am not just here for my own vested interests but to help support the entire crypto ecosystem.   @MakerMan is one of the few people I know who has contributed in nearly all of SourceCred\u2019s partner communities, and generally offers valuable insights. I suspect they may be right here. At least if we keep the current configuration. I will say that MakerMan is likely representative of many contributors, but not all.     MakerMan:  I mean honestly rather than just increase rewards hoping for more participation (what does that mean really in terms of community growth - support - actual change) perhaps a view towards what the real community goals are?   Ah, but what are the real community goals? The 100B DAO question. It seems Maker is still figuring this out, via projects like Project Compass. SourceCred is going through a similar process right now actually as it decentralizes. It\u2019s difficult work. Which maybe should be rewarded?     MakerMan:  Honestly come to think that while discussion and input (particularly from people with significant experience) have value, over time it looks like implementation has a much higher value than input with experience. It is very easy to see people like @hexonaut or @Primoz who take ideas and put them into code are 10x more valuable than anyone else imo.   It is certainly true that certain contributors, often devs, can have outsized impacts. However, whether a contributor or contribution is 10x, 100x, or -10x, is typically an individual, subjective judgement. Objective metrics are often worse. SourceCred I think does a good job at capturing the complex, intersubjective reality. However, I do think that currently SourceCred has some blind spots that make valuing (and incentivizing) certain high-value contributions difficult. To increase rewards significantly, I think more customization work may be needed (more thoughts on this coming).     AstronautThis:      MakerMan:  Do we just want more forum posts?   At the moment, I think SourceCred is set up such that this is rewarded. If we use forum post count as a metric of participation, it will indeed look like a success but I don\u2019t know if that is the right metric to chase.   Actually, we used to use posts as a metric, but switched to likes due to initial feedback from Maker\u2013we were seeing contributors with a high volume of low-effort posts get too much Cred. Cred is now minted on likes, then flows through the graph. If you\u2019re curious, here\u2019s a discussion on SourceCred\u2019s discourse about that change. We are encouraging more posts I think, but only to the extent people like them. I haven\u2019t yet noticed significant \u2018like inflation\u2019 (the attack vector with this strategy), and the scores are still high quality IMO (open to challenges on this).     AstronautThis:  I still don\u2019t quite find this spending justified to be honest because the \u201ccontrol\u201d experiment of how good the community would be without SourceCred doesn\u2019t exist. I also have not seen this level of spending to increase community engagement in any other mainstream crypto project. Admittedly, it\u2019s not easy to figure out what is appropriate here but the conflict of interest here is very hard to ignore.   We\u2019ve actually tracked an increase in engagement, as explained above. However, we can\u2019t be sure this was caused by SourceCred, and not other factors. I will say we\u2019ve seen increased engagement with other communities as well. I think conflicts of interests can be mitigated by MKR holders ability to defund it. OK, crashing again here  Will be back tomorrow to address some of the proposed ideas, and provide context and some recommendations. ",

                    "content": "Reply continued\u2026 In the last two replies, I offered thoughts on SoruceCred governance, gaming, and optimal payouts, and the goals of SourceCred and concerns raised. Here, I\u2019ll address some of the proposed ideas, offer context around what is currently possible, and my personal opinions (not official SourceCred opinions). Seeing a lot of relevant concerns and good ideas. Before addressing those, a quick primer on the levers SourceCred exposes:  Tweaking algorithm weights Utilizing features of the Discourse plugin (e.g. the feature SourceCred built for Maker that allows extra Cred to be minted on topics with certain categories and tags) Changes to payout amount (e.g. the last increase back in Nov 2020 from 2.5k DAI/week to 5k DAI/week). Changes to payout formula (e.g. when we changed parameters to make the algorithm more responsive and pay newer contributors more) Education: more knowledge around the algorithm, which may mitigate accidental misalignment, and give the community ideas for further customizations (hopefully this will help )  Payout formula ideas: One thing to keep in mind here is that the GovAlpha CU (which is funding SourceCred) has, afaik, a fixed budget through June.     prose11:  Practically, it\u2019s super easy to input different distribution numbers in the SourceCred instance. Budgeting might be a concern though, as currently it\u2019s up to the GovAlpha budget to support SourceCred so increases to payouts would necessitate a bigger distribution to the Core Unit. I wonder if there\u2019s a way to automate the size, otherwise maybe a Parameter Proposals Group might be reasonable.   DAI vs MKR     reuptaken:  I voted yes, and I think that (I\u2019m not sure if this is technically possible) MKR should be used, not DAI. MKR is the \u201cgovernance\u201d currency for MakerDAO.   Since the beginning, the community has been split over whether to distribute DAI or MKR. When we surveyed the community for our final report, the split was roughly 50/50:   Do you, or would you prefer to receive MKR through SourceCred rather than DAI?  RESPONSE: (16 responses) 3 for MKR, 3 for DAI, 10 for No Preference, of those No Preference votes 3 advocated for 50/50 allocation, and several references made to leaving it up to users  When this has come up subsequently on the forum, the responses have seemed roughly 50/50 too. Arguments against focus on volatility of payouts, tax concerns, and dilution of MKR. Arguments for MKR generally focus on aligning incentives and increasing governance participation. Also worth noting that deciding how to source the MKR and implement that could be difficult.     prose11:  The price movement of MKR could make this rather difficult, as well as sourcing it @reuptaken.   Personally, I think MKR would be better. While I am sympathetic to the volatility argument, especially for contributors with greater financial needs (indeed, working on SourceCred for me is meaningful largely because it pays those contributors), I think it better aligns incentives. If payouts are increased, I think the argument for MKR becomes stronger, because introducing more volatility may deter those posting solely for the money, which could dilute the culture and mission (more on this later). Working for a volatile governance token is a sign of skin-in-the-game. As would putting it in the hat, which could be detected. There are also ways to mitigate the volatility for those than don\u2019t have the ability to shoulder it. Like pegging to a fixed dollar amount at the time of distribution. Volatility can also, when the price is mooning, catapult contributors into a place of financial security, creating loyalty (psychologically, money earned is valued more than free airdrop money). I have seen this effect firsthand when I working for the Decred DAO for DCR, its governance token. For the time being however, I think the support for DAI and high costs associated with a switch to MKR may keep us on DAI for a while.     reuptaken:  I\u2019m not sure if this is difficult. At the end of the week we could allocate MKR worth eg 10K DAI to participants. But I\u2019d rather set some fixed amount of MKR and update it periodically (eg. 4x a year or so).   So this is basically what 1Hive settled on. 1Hive is currently distributing $20k/week of their governance token (among other uses) HNY, up to 30 HNY. They\u2019ve revisited this several times when a proposal is up to fund SourceCred payouts. The 30 HNY cap I presume is to protect against the token mooning and the rewards being too high, which risks increased gaming; this did happen last year actually during an earlier moon when rewards accidentally skyrocketed to ~$60k/week. SourceCred was able to work with 1Hive (a tithing partner) to mitigate the gaming and build features to protect against it. But would not recommend trial by fire. Previously, I wouldn\u2019t have worried about MKR mooning, but dayum   Dynamic payouts     juan:  Why are we aligning rewards in this zero-sum game? We want people to tell their friends to come, not the opposite.       juan:  Right now, it feels like there\u2019s a pool to be distributed about the participants. (Am I right on this one?) If the participants grow in a given month, the Dai received by each will diminish.   Correct. With a fixed amount, as each new contributor opt ins, the DAI distributed to others diminishes. Indeed, we\u2019ve seen a steady number of optins in the last few months, with a recent uptick due to @Elihu\u2019s outreach efforts. We\u2019re up to 83 now. I have not been particularly concerned about this yet, because of two factors: 1) we have opted out several high Cred earning contributors like yourself, freeing up DAI for newcomers, and 2) a relatively small number of newcomers stick around and earn significant Cred; Maker governance is hard  I also just spot check the balances going out whenever I do payouts, and my gut feel is that most new contributors are being rewarded fairly. Though would love to hear other perspectives on that. Personally, I have been surprised that I haven\u2019t felt that zero sum energy yet. And haven\u2019t heard complaints yet, at least not in the SourceCred community. That does not mean it isn\u2019t there. I\u2019m just one perspective, and this is by definition something people might not speak up about.     juan:  Should we not try to find a Cred baseline and assign it a certain amount of Dai, and if more people are participating, we give out more Dai (and vice-versa)?   I think this would be better from an incentive standpoint. I even wrote a post imagining distribution amounts calibrated using the Bitcoin difficulty algorithm, with Cred functioning as hashpower, or Proof-of-Labor (PoL). Pegging 1 Cred to a set dollar amount has also been proposed for payouts in the SourceCred community. One objection to this is that it incentivizes \u2018like inflation\u2019, giving the community a way to increase payouts without increasing value delivered.  Another is that it just makes budgeting more difficult, as would be the case with Maker. Time limited payouts     Planet_X:  I voted \u2018Abstain\u2019 as well. I think sourcecred is a fine program, but maybe it should be limited to a year or so per participant?   My initial reaction is no, even though some communities do seem to be discovering SourceCred\u2019s primary utility for them is recruitment. However, I think there could be value in giving people an ability to express their preferences, either explicitly with actions or implicitly with inaction. Perhaps people that completely check out and don\u2019t care could have their DAI/MKR balance displayed or used differently. Perhaps those with more financial resources would be happy to put their balance to work earning yield for contributors with less resources. Just spitballing, but I suspect introducing friction and illiquidity could actually be useful here somehow. Reducing payouts     MakerMan:  Honestly your comments and my own thinking make me wonder if this poll should also include reducing or eliminate rewards as I think that is just as valid a test as doubling them. One thing we already doubled rewards and it is my own impression that there wasn\u2019t too much change.   It would be an interesting experiment. Have not seen a community that started flowing rewards using SoruceCred turn it off. Distribution infrastructure ideas:     MakerMan:  One thing I would like to see be done is to perhaps make these SC and other DAI payments on a sidechain like xDAI or at least an opt in to payments on X side chain choice. Not entirely sure what SC costs/month in ETH to distribute and whether that would compare to bridging and distributing but as L1 costs continue to increase something to think about. This would also allow for a lower barrier to distribution and possibly higher participation.   Our gast costs for the last batch distribution were $470 in ETH  We\u2019ve recently started exploring L2 solutions as part of a larger design to distribute DAI directly from the protocol, but this is at a very early stage, and wary to jump into L2 wars before we have a clearer picture of the engineering limitations.     iammeeoh:  it would be awesome to have more frequent and automatic payouts.   This is on the roadmap:) SourceCred doesn\u2019t have an actual roadmap yet, but we\u2019re looking to start work on this in the next month or two. Likely starting on mainnet though, and gas costs could limit frequency.     iammeeoh:  In a world moving to L2/sidechains, it would be nice to be able to receive the payouts in xDAI/arbitrium. In such a space, even daily rewards would make sense. Or even \u201cstreaming\u201d of rewards (dreaming).   Obsessed with streaming payments. Sablier was a Maker dev gran recipient, which is pretty cool. I know Superfluid is on xDAI now as well and doing interesting things. The main concern there (aside from smart contract dev bandwidth) is security. Currently, a human (typically me) has a chance to review Cred scores and payouts before sending them out. This provides and opportunity to catch gaming. With real-time streaming payments, and distributing large amounts, a gamer could potentially siphon off a lot of money before being detected. Not only that, it would make gaming into a hella fun game  Which is partially why I want to see it. But Maker is maybe not the best place to try it first. Algorithm tweaks     prose11:  One interesting idea is that you can always run \u201cone-time\u201d data sets via the SourceCred algorithm where you apply a special waiting (maybe we boost all posts in the Governance category for instance) and do a distribution from those numbers.   Creating separate one-time Cred instances could be easier operationally actually. I kind of like this idea. Programming different goals into a single instance can be tricky, as it\u2019s more difficult to evaluate the desired outcomes in the scores. We\u2019re currently investigating using the category and tags minting feature developed for Maker to incentivize governance actions. This will allow us to apply a multiplier on Cred minted on topics with a given category or tag. The has been delayed due to some unexpected quirks in Cred flows in simulations, and a recent upgrade of the core algorithm. Hoping to present the SourceCred working group with some options on this soon.     mrabino1:  in my eyes, sourcecred can and should be continually \u201ctweaked\u201d to incentivize different behavior and types of posts\u2026 e.g. we could consider to compensate Signal Requests from community members that have \u201ccred\u201d. etc\u2026 we are just starting the exponential phase of maker\u2026 we need the community to grow \u2026   This is the way. I wonder though what the optimal (and sustainable) growth curve is for the community. Is the growth prediction @Planet_X made in the post that started it all coming true?  image1256\u00d7712 25.7 KB  Does the Maker governance community have the bandwidth right now to onboard new contributors, execute on its larger decentralization plans, Core Units, etc. and create a governance process around changing SourceCred parameters? To be honest, I hesitate to bring all this up, as I know from experience how much work it can be, and I know there\u2019s a lot of other important priorities right now competing for scarce attention      MakerMan:  One thing that I think is interesting with respect to increasing SC rewards is an idea that people posting here should also have some minimum MKR stake, and governance participation as a kind of multiplier regarding rewards in general (SC, governance, etc.).   This could be happening weakly already due to the badges? Do people engage more with those with lots of badges? There is precident for this from different angles. The Friends With Benefits (FWB) community, which was running SourceCred, required I believe 3 FWB tokens to get into their Discord and get Cred and FWB distributions using SourceCred? (cc: @Cooopahtroopa). 1Hive I believe requires that you have 1 HNY to have a certain role on their Discord, which allows your reactions to mint more Cred. MetaGame gates their community (and therefore Cred) according to consistent activity OR holding a certain amount of their token, SEED. These implementations though are either gating comms platforms, or giving people with certain roles more power to influence the Cred graph. I can\u2019t think of a community using SourceCred that has tied governance actions directly to Cred issuance (though it could totally exist). One interesting comparison is a recent proposal on r/CryptoCurrenty  to distribute 20% more MOONs (the ERC-20 they distribute according to karma) to users that keep their MOONs in their Reddit Valut, where tokens have to be to vote on governance changes in the sub (i.e. their hat). Karma is a reputation score similar to SourceCred in some ways. Reddit and Discourse are both forums. Could be good lessons there. As a side note, have been impressed with the ability of these subs to govern their tokens and communities. Makes me bullish on the idea. In summary, I think Maker could double payouts safely. I think any gaming could be addressed. But personally (again, not an official SourceCred position), I\u2019m a bit hesitant though because of a few factors: 1) we could be overpaying for some contributions, which may have unexpected negative effects, such as delegitimizing the scores or creating unrealistic expectations, 2) we may see more contributors contributing just for money, which could affect cohesion during a sensitive transition period for the DAO, 3) we currently don\u2019t yet have a governance process for the community to reach consensus on protocol changes, and 4) the current budget for SourceCred has been approved through July. I think increasing payouts will be more feasible once we gather more feedback, gain the ability to target certain contributions we think are undervalued (e.g. through category and tag weighting), and have more clarity around governance issues and the community\u2019s goals. PHEW, Great thread! ",

While correlation does not equal causation, engagement appears to be on a general uptrend.   I think that this piece of data is not really sufficient, if we look at it critically. The crypto bull run is here and we will see more engagement over this period, simply because more people hold MKR, the token value is rising and that will interest people. Our evidence is more anecdotal at best.     s_ben:  I have seen similar anecdotal evidence elsewhere. Not just in communities using SourceCred, but also on Reddit subs I frequent, such as r/ethtrader and r/CryptoCurrency, which are distributing ERC-20s based on karma   To be honest, r/ethtrader became a cesspit of troll posts and spam after their move to monetize karma. The subreddit broke into two communities and the new community r/ethfinance which specifically does not monetize karma is much much better community. Please check both out right now and make your own conclusions on which community is better. The split of that subreddit is a very good counterexample to the things being claimed here and is the closest we will get to an experiment with a good control! Moreover, the same thing happened with r/cryptocurrency. Moons resulted in a significant lowering of the quality of discussion there. SourceCred is still \u201cunder the radar\u201d but when word gets out, I guarantee you\u2019ll see the same issue here.     juan:  I think I speak for the three of us when I say that it didn\u2019t. We were involved (in a way or another) before SourceCred was implemented.   I think this cannot be emphasized enough. The altruistic posters here - the ones who post with no expectation of reward except the growth and betterment of the Maker protocol - are always gonna be the ones that carry the community.     MakerMan:  wondering if we were maybe at a saturation point where more rewards wouldn\u2019t get much more participation. Personally I am all for experiments as long as we are willing to try SC rewards down at some point.   I would think that this is far more important to try to check if SourceCred is resulting in higher quality discussion here before doubling it. Finally, I will say that talk is actually cheap. As @MakerMan pointed out, it\u2019s easy to throw out great ideas on the forum. The hard work is implementing that as an MIP, for example. As long as our core protocol is doing well, I doubt we\u2019ll ever have a shortage of ideas, talk and banter on the forum, even if there was no SourceCred rewards at all. If that sounds plausible to you, then we should be asking if this is the right moment to be voting to double rewards. ",

Yeah, know r/ethfinance somewhat. Though wasn\u2019t really part of that community when the split went down. I wrote up a case study on donuts in comparison to SourceCred, which gives a brief (perhaps biased ) history of the sub, donuts and the community reaction to them. r/cslarson (main r/ethtrader mod, who was tinkering with SourceCred in its earliest incarnation) responded in the comments with some interesting discussion around donut tokenomics and governance.

Tbh, glad to see the memes here getting Cred. Also happy it\u2019s not getting out of control like it is on r/ethtrader and r/CryptoCurrency. Half their governance votes have been on ideas to keep meme rewards in check. Looking forward to experimenting with increasing rewards for \u2018serious work\u2019. It\u2019s a difficult problem, but the formality of Maker\u2019s governance actually leaves a lot of useful artifacts to work with, so I think we\u2019ll be able to systematize something that moves the needle.  image843\u00d7249 64.4 KB  ",

                    "content": "    Deimos:  @s_ben is it possible to put some floor limit on the dai given to participants?   There has always been a 10 DAI minimum to receive on-chain payouts. The SourceCred working group just decided to raise it to 20 DAI actually, thanks to suggestion from @AstronautThis on last week\u2019s payouts post. I\u2019m planning to announce that in the next weekly payouts post.     Deimos:  am i the only one seeing sh**ty posts to game the algortihm?   Have not seen complains about this in a long time. Some context: when SourceCred was originally proposed to Maker a little over a year ago, initial feedback was that spammy posts were getting over rewarded. We made a fairly big change in the algorithm, switching to minting Cred based on likes instead of posts as we were doing previously. That improved the scores a lot. We also implemented a feature for Maker that uses Discourse\u2019s trust levels to determine how much Cred a user\u2019s like creates. So new users mint zero Cred, and long-time, more trusted users mint more. This should generally discentivize spammy posts. However, it is SourceCred\u2019s belief that spammy content, like gaming generally, isn\u2019t something that can ever be eliminated completely, from any rewards system. Only mitigated and discentivized. Additionally, spammy is often in the eye of the beholder. The algorithm is designed to reflect the community\u2019s collective valuation. So some may find a post spammy that others do not. That said, it\u2019s definitely something to look into, especially if there\u2019s intentional gaming. Do you have examples of posts you think are spammy? Feel free to DM me if that is more comfortable. ",
