What I meant to say is that for merging an EIP with Draft status, auto-merge means there is no particular Editor review needed.  For ERC I feel that a minimum of 2 implementations is required to get to review. If a developing ERC only has one project supporting it then I don\u2019t see it getting much decent input at the review stage.  I can totally resonate with your sentiment. There is a spectrum of people\u2019s preference. Some expressed to me that two ref-impls as a criteria for advancing to \u201cFinal\u201d are too high a bar. Some (You @abcoathup for example) even think this requirement is too low a bar even for \u201cLast Call\u201d and hope to make it a bar as the bar for advancing to \u201cReview\u201d.

                    "content": "Thank you for starting this discussion @xinbenlv as it\u2019s an important one that I\u2019ve seen come up a few times now. I need to sit down and write out a longer post for this, but I think two places to consider for this are the following: IETF\u2019s process: IETF | The IETF process: an informal guide Old W3C process: 7 W3C Recommendation Track Process New W3C process: W3C Process Document I don\u2019t think either of these are cut and dry drop in replacements for the governance here, but I think looking to what others have done and understanding why they\u2019ve taken things that way will help to inform the direction we as a community wish to go. One thing worth noting for both of these process first off is timelines. In both cases, when someone undertakes the process of producing a standard in either of these places I\u2019d expect it to take roughly a year at least to go from first draft to completion. Usually it\u2019s a multiyear effort though which can take 2 or 3 years. In fact, I\u2019ve seen some take longer and it\u2019s only because WG charters were set to expire that a first iteration of a standard was shipped. So with that said, I think a good thing for us to set as a guiding consideration here is \u201cHow long do we expect it to take from an EIP first drafted to an EIP being shipped and multiple implementations are relying upon it?\u201d In my opinion, I think a good answer to this is between 6 to 18 months depending on the piece of work you want to ship and how many parties are working on this.

The main reason for a timeline is to prevent specs from becoming bloated or taking forever to ship because new people keep joining and requesting additional changes or adding additional requirements late in the process which can slow consensus down. A really good talk I\u2019ve seen on someone who chaired the OAuth WG covers some of the reasons for why this happens via talking about the various people who contribute to these types of processes here: CIS 2016- Thursday, June 9- So You Want to Run a Standards Group- Justin Richer - YouTube It\u2019s worth pointing out though his point at 19:54 though which is that \u201cStandards development doesn\u2019t run out of time or money, but people in the WG run out of patience\u201d. There\u2019s a lot of wisdom in this statement because it suggests that if we don\u2019t set arbitrary deadlines then we\u2019re not likely to actually ship things and call something done. I\u2019ve seen arbitrary deadlines work very well as a forcing function for creating consensus since most people would rather see something ship than nothing at all after they\u2019ve spent a lot of time contributing to it\u2019s development.

If people operate in a faster time frame that\u2019s a good indicator normally that things are non-controversial assuming there\u2019s actually multiple implementations working on it. Probably another thing that would be important here is that when EIPs hit particular milestones that there\u2019s also a broad method of notifying people (basically people who don\u2019t watch the EIP repo) that EIPs are hitting particular milestones and have ways to address objections during this process. E.g. Brave and Metamask are both on record for objecting to EIP-5749 (mine in the PR and FEM discussion and Metamasks in the FEM discussion ) but the EIP was still advanced forward anyways. That seems like a failure of the process if two wallets are actively against supporting an EIP directly related to their implementations, but the process doesn\u2019t have any way to establish consensus. Simply put, if wallets aren\u2019t supporting this EIP it\u2019s effectively DoA even if it does hit final. Especially if Metamask isn\u2019t going to support it given their userbase. Furthermore, by publishing this EIP it legitimizes it in a way that creates more web compatibility issues for DApps like Opensea which may now have to support an additional property if they want their users to be able to use MEW wallet. My goal is to avoid these types of images showing up on DApps.  image1269\u00d7710 37.7 KB  ",
