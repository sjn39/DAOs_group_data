                    "content": " Summary  image968992\u00d7288 37 KB  This proposal, if passed, would issue a grant of 40k GTC (0.008% of the GTC treasury) to CLR.Fund, a project with a similar mission as Gitcoin (fund public goods) but with a complementary product. Disclaimer: This proposal was co-authored/reviewed by @austingriffith , @auryn, @owocki and myself.  Abstract CLR.Fund is another prominent Quadratic Funding project in the Ethereum ecosystem with a mission/ethos that is similar to Gitcoin. This proposal issues them a grant, which solves for the near term the funding of CLR.Fund. Secondarily, this proposal if passed would  Extend previous friendly contact between Kevin Owocki and Auryn MacMillian to formally affirm that Gitcoin & CLRFund are friendly projects built around similar missions. Change the narrative created by other competitive projects working on the same domain. That is the misguided belief that we must have sharp elbows - boxing each other out from each other\u2019s users and demonstrate loud social media clap-backs. It is possible that the goodwill between the two projects could be extended into a formal integration or partnership one day - especially with the Decentralize Gitcoin workstream gaining speed. By pushing new tech and solutions on top of QF (such as MACI), CLR.Fund can act as a testbed/testnet for future gitcoin features and visa-versa.   Motivation Gitcoin\u2019s mission is to build & fund the open web. Gitcoin has done that in a few ways, Ethical Ads, Hackathons, Grants, and KERNEL. Gitcoin Grants is a prominent pillar of the Gitcoin ecosystem, and momentum from Gitcoin Grants has been extended to many similar QF projects - recently Downtown Stimulus and FundOSS were driven by the Gitcoin team. Outside of the Gitcoin team, CLRfund, RXC Voice, and Build Guild have been shipped by other teams in the ecosystem. Similarly to CLR.Fund, Gitcoin Grants is reliant on Quadratic Funding. A mechanism for \u201cthe mathemtically optimal democratic funding of public goods.\u201d Although QF is very powerful, there are a number of problems with QF - scaling it involves solving thorny governance problems - Sybil resistance and collusion resistance are prominent examples. The exploration of this design space is a public good to all QF projects - insofar as the learnings advance all QF projects towards their missions. For this reason - It is our assertion that CLR.Fund\u2019s implementation of Quadratic Funding is complementary to Gitcoin. Most notably, in the following ways.  It is pushing forward MACI. It is pushing forward sybil resistance & collusion resistance. It is funding public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem. It is iterative and increasingly effectively proven itself, having run 7 rounds so far. Gitcoin Grants has funded CLR.Fund $33k in the past. The CLR.Fund has taken UI/design inspiration from Gitcoin Grants, and extended them to their decentralized QF protocol. Given that Gitcoin\u2019s existing Grants product is centralized, and work to decentralize is ongoing, a partnership with CLRFund could be a fruitful way to accelerate the decentralization of Gitcoin Grants - and also to make Quadratic Funding in the Ethereum ecosystem more anti-fragile (similar to how there are many client implementations of ETH2).   Specification This proposal if passed would transfer 40k GTC to 0xadca3cF41e2e2517F1862b3CA18E8beF561EEded - the address specified in the CLR Fund Governance Doc as the contributor funds address. This grant is a no strings attached gesture to the CLR.Fund team. It is possible the two projects may formally work together in the future, but not a requirement for the dispersal of funds.  Benefits See \u201cMotivation\u201d section above.  Drawbacks 40k GTC would be removed from the treasury. ",

Given that bias, I\u2019ll abstain from casting a vote. Anyone that wants to vote on this and has delegated to me should delegate to someone else for this proposal. My understanding of this proposal is that it is less about specific future deliverables and more an acknowledgement of past work pushing the Quadratic Funding and Ethereum Public goods space forward. So I\u2019d be inclined to view it in the same spirit of the Retroactive Public Goods funding post that Optimism recently published. In other words, this would be the Gitcoin DAO explicitly saying \u201cwe value the contributions you have made to the QF space and want to align our future efforts towards funding Ethereum\u2019s public goods\u201d. That said, I do think there are specific deliverables that we are already planned and would be beneficial to the Gitcoin DAO, that could be much more easily achieved given this extra funding. Specifically, we are:  Building a production ready decentralized QF protocol, with baked in Sybil and collusion resistance, that can scale to billions of users. Making it easy for anyone to deploy their own instance of the clrfund to fund whatever public goods they want, including both the contracts and the app. Building in a modular and extensible way so that instances of clrfund can choose the governance, Sybil resistance, and recipient registry solutions that best suit their community and use-case.  This funding would allow some of our contributors to focus on this full-time, along with bringing new talent in (likely from the Gitcoin community via bounties). One important thing for the Gitcoin DAO to consider is if/how this fits with the decentralize grants workstream. ",

Above I mentioned that, at the current value, this could cover one year of costs for two devs and a PM, plus some misc. expenses. So perhaps vesting it continuously over the course of a year, or in four discrete tranches, would make sense. As much as I\u2019m confident that we could be trusted to do it on a handshake, we have a variety of great tools available to us to eliminate the need for trust, so we may as well make use of them.

So I\u2019d be inclined to view it in the same spirit of the Retroactive Public Goods funding post that Optimism recently published.   Hi. I am overall supportive of the effort clr.fund is doing but I do wonder why we need a separate proposal to acknowledge the past effort. The normal Gitcoin round should fulfil that purpose. If we pass a proposal without set goals, targets, and deliverables, it may be very difficult to assess the effectiveness of the value delivered. I do suggest changing the format to the \u201cBudget proposal\u201d type. ",

The information you have provided in a few different comments is helpful, however, I don\u2019t think anyone should have to go digging through the comments to get the details of what money is going to be spent on. I would like to see this information up front in the original proposal. I would also expect it to be presented in a way that makes a clear link from the funding to the inputs to the outcomes. So your goal is to produce XYZ product, that will take XY hours of time from XYZ type of staff @ $XY rate + $$ other costs, therefor out financial needs are $$$. As opposed to, $40K sounds good, here\u2019s roughly what we can do with it. ",
