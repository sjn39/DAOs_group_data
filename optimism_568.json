If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has: We\u2019ve raised $700k on seed and private rounds last year, now we are doing an IDO on the 15-17.03.2023 on Poolz, Enjinstarter and Bullperks for $825k public round, which will keep us going for 40 months at our current burn rate of $20k per month. Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 48k OP How do you justify the size of the grant? We need it so we can build an incentive system for the native version of our product on OP, we\u2019ll be using the grant to attract and incentivise app developers and users to integrate and mint NFTs on OP. Roadmap Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project: Our step-by-step plan to build an incentive system for the native version of our product on OP: 1. Identify the key goals and metrics we want to achieve with the incentive system, such as the number of app developers and users we want to attract and the amount of NFTs we want to mint on OP. 2. Determine the budget for the incentive system based on the grant amount and other available resources. 3. Develop a clear and easy-to-understand set of rules and guidelines for app developers and users to participate in the incentive system. 4. Design and implement a system for tracking and verifying the activities of app developers and users, such as integrating with OP and minting NFTs. 5. Set up a mechanism for distributing rewards to app developers and users based on their performance and contribution to the ecosystem, such as a token or other forms of incentives. 6. Launch and promote the incentive system to our target audience, such as via social media, newsletters, and other marketing channels. 7. Monitor and evaluate the performance of the incentive system regularly, and make the necessary adjustments based on the feedback and data collected. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: That will be determined by the level of demand from within our community to build a native version of our Fiat to NFTs payment system on Optimism. What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?: We\u2019ll use the OP tokens to create the incentive system for our app developers and app users community to build and mint NFTs on OP. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period. Our benchmark milestones for integrating to Optimism and creating an incentive system for our dev community build and allow their users to mint NFTs on the Optimism network: 1. Month 1-2: Research and planning phase, including analyzing the current OP ecosystem identifying potential areas for integration. 2. Month 2-3: Development of the necessary smart contract and tools to enable minting and trading of NFTs on the Optimism network. 3. Month 3-4: Testing and optimization of the NFT minting and trading process on the Optimism network. 4. Month 4-5: Launch of the NFT minting and trading feature on the Optimism network, with initial incentives for app developers and users to integrate and mint NFTs. 5. Month 5-6: Analysis of the initial adoption and usage of the NFT minting and trading feature on the Optimism network, with adjustments made to the incentive system as needed. 6.

This will include testing the solution and ensuring a smooth user experience. 2. Milestone 2 (6 months): Launch our native solution on Optimism, including the ability for users to mint NFTs on the network. This will include developing a marketing campaign to attract users to the platform. 3. Milestone 3 (9 months): Build and launch the incentive system for app developers and users to integrate and mint NFTs on Optimism using our web3 integration tools. This will include determining the best incentive structures to use and implementing them on the platform. 4. Milestone 4 (12 months): Reach a significant user base with our platform on Optimism, with a minimum of 1,000 active users and 10,000 total users. This will be achieved through ongoing marketing efforts and improving the user experience of our products. Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: Our project is helping solve the problem of lack of adoption and use cases on the Optimism ecosystem. Despite its potential, many users and developers may not be aware of the benefits of using the Optimism network, or they may not have the necessary tools or knowledge to take advantage of it. By providing a plug-and-play solution for developers to easily integrate web3 capabilities into their applications, and by creating an incentive system for users to mint NFTs on the Optimism network, we\u2019re helping drive the adoption and usage of the Optimism ecosystem. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: Our proposal offers value by providing a plug-and-play solution for game developers to easily integrate blockchain technology into their games on the Optimism network, creating new opportunities for NFT minting and fostering broader adoption of decentralized technologies in the gaming industry. The incentive system we are creating will attract and incentivize app developers and users to integrate and mint NFTs on the Optimism network, further driving adoption and growth. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Our solution will be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem by onboarding many Web2 brands into Optimism, expanding the user base and creating new use cases for the network. This will lead to increased transaction volume, higher demand for Optimism tokens, and more development activity within the ecosystem. How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: As a founder of InteractWith, I am fully committed to building on Optimism and helping to grow the ecosystem. We are excited about the opportunity to onboard web2 brands into the Optimism network and we understand that building on a new platform can be challenging, but we are committed to working closely with the Optimism community to overcome any obstacles and make this a success. Is your project Optimism Native?: Not yet Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: YES I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined [here]: [Yes/No]: YES ",

We\u2019ll make sure we\u2019re around to address any questions you have in this process. We might also be asking additional questions here during the review process so please check this thread for updates on a regular basis. One thing to be mindful of is that in the Cycle 11 we require the milestones to be precisely defined into two categories - critical milestones and benchmark milestones as described in Milestone Assessment . Could you please restructure your milestones description to follow this structure? Some additional questions that came to my mind while reading your proposal, answering them may affect our rating of your proposal:  On which chains are you going to launch InteractWith? You noted that InteractWith is \u201cnot yet\u201d Optimism native, but is it going to be exclusive for Optimism or is Optimism going to be just one of the chains you\u2019re going to launch with? Why do you believe Optimism is the best place for launching InteractWith, what are the features of Optimism that make it best suited for launching your platform? How are you going to integrate with fiat onramping? Do you have any ongoing partnerships, which onramp solutions will you integrate with (if any)? Will you use the Grant solely to incentivize building on top of InteractWith? I see that you plan on structuring the details of the incentivization program during the project but can you share any early vision of what would it be and how will it work? It\u2019s important as this is the main usage of the grant distribution if I understand it correctly. What are the revenue streams from your project? You mention that your core product will be free and there won\u2019t be any subscription plans as opposed to your competition - so what exactly will you charge for and how will you split the revenue stream with the teams building on top of InteractWIth?  Thanks in advance for the answers, in case you had any questions don\u2019t hesitate to ask here or reach out to us! ",
