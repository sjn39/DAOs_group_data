I have used the Oasis app many times ND am not a newbie however  brief slip of the mind with what I was doing caused me to lose a significant amount of money. If I may post here to request this decision be brought forward and also as a record of my lost DAI of the following tx hash: 0xd1f114e36866048f257587e95e3ae6498a67a1ec6be7a4d0e894b6ad212a8928 I appreciate the consideration and it would mean a lot to me to gain access to these lost funds while attempting to utilize the DeFi ecosystem in its early years.

This is a very good point, as DAI gradually gets lost in unrecoverable addresses, it could cause issues for DAI\u2019s peg stability. One consideration is that Maker would need to verify that the DAI in question is provably/permanently unrecoverable, and then organize an executive vote that mints new DAI to the party that lost funds and adjusts internal system accounting to correct for this. I imagine the costs involved would be significant, but maybe could be lower in percent terms if recovery operations were carried out on a periodic basis in batches. Costs should be deducted from the recovered amounts before distributing to impacted users on a pro rata basis. This would probably require a MIP to implement. ",

These addresses are handled in the TUSD ERC20 by being swept to a single address.  This allows them to link deposits to users, while saving on gas.  In general, we absolutely must prove DAI is lost forever if we\u2019re going to mint replacement DAI.  In this case, we can know with near certainty that this DAI is lost forever as the Trust Token team doesn\u2019t have private key access to these deposit addresses. @SebVentures I want to caution against thinking about the PSM as a magic bullet for the peg.  It very much is, but given changing regulatory climates, we cannot always count on this mechanism.  That is, if tomorrow all the USD stablecoin IOU collateral were blacklisted, we would need to fall back on the old peg balancing mechanism of supply, demand, and arbitrage.  I believe we should still reason as though the PSM doesn\u2019t exist, which would make lost DAI or too much DAI hoarded in the surplus buffer a threat to the peg.  The bonus is that we ingest less stablecoins when reasoning this way, and thus less custodial risk. On the topic of lost DAI, I think we can have a special collateral type for LostDAI that mints 1:1 with DAI much like SAI; however, SAI redeemed at shutdown would still have value.  This new collateral wouldn\u2019t, as it\u2019s really just an accounting trick to represent LostDAI.  This is like the Rai stone the Yap workers dropped in the ocean.  The village decided that still had value:    NPR.org    The Island Of Stone Money On the island of Yap, people used giant stone coins that weighed thousands of pounds. The island's story helps answer a fundamental economic question: What is money?      Our village may decide this DAI still has value, but I would have to think of how we solve this value problem at ES.  It would also be considerably more efficient if we could make a merkle tree redemption contract than give each user a vat DAI balance. But, periodically, I\u2019m in favor of solving this problem for DAI users. ",

I have posted my original thread which is here: Lost Dai in contract reading through all the comments, I find that returning dai to those who have lost it yes can have its complications, and related costs. Has the idea of charging a recovery fee, per user, of say 5%, been floated? I lost 236,000$ of dai. It was a really stupid time in my life. My girlfriend was caught on video doing some very suspect stuff, while i was in florida awaiting her to arrive, and I thought i had left something at my house that would have given her a chance to decode some of my crypto accounts, and at the last minute before she arrived, i went into a flurry of transferring everything to a new account. The dai was my primary concern, yet when i went to transfer immediately the eth network was flooded, and wouldnt transfer, so i tried a few other tokens, those worked, moved a test amount of dai, it worked, and somehow got frazzled and copy pasted the curve token address i had pasted into my metamask account. the real frustrating thing is that i have been in crypto for so long and have never made a mistake, and i have sent so many transactions. Also, knowing that there is nothing I, nor curve can do to get my dai out, except me just stare at my money sitting there in the curve contract address: 0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52 just look at token balance and my dai will stare at you like it stares back at me. The hardest thing wasnt just knowing my girlfriend did suspect stuff, its that it led me to behave uncharacteristically and lose my cool and lose money. I feel awful. I think there are a good many ideas here, and I hope from a user perspective we can get this ironed out. Thanks for everything guys. ",
