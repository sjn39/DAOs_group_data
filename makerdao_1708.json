Specification  Core Unit ID SH-001  Motivation MakerDAO is restructuring the work and the workforce across the DAO according to the Endgame Plan. The mandate for this Core Unit does not support a standalone Core Unit and will be better aligned within a cluster of a MetaDAO. As a result, this Core Unit will be offboarded to support the transition.  Core Unit Work Continuity All activities associated with SH-001 will stop upon the ratification of this subproposal.  Mandated Actor Status The facilitator will have their Mandated Actor status removed.  Golden Parachute  DAI A Golden Parachute payout will be provided to the Core Unit for the facilitator to distribute to their team. The amount will be based on the following calculations: Core Unit's Monthly Contributor Budget x 3 = Golden Parachute amount 10,833 DAI x 4 months = 43332 DAI  MKR Any MKR accrued (vested or not) at the time of this MIP\u2019s ratification will be eligible for payout. If the MKR Incentive Plan has a cliff, it will be ignored and allow the MKR amount to be transferred to the Core Unit. Estimated MKR accrued at the time of the subproposal ratification: 26.04 MKR  Budget Implementation Upon ratification of this proposal:  All DAI DssVest streams will be terminated. All MKR DssVest streams will be terminated. Any amount of DAI over the Golden Parachute amount in the Core Unit\u2019s Multi-sig wallet will be returned to the protocol using DssBlow by the date of the following Executive Vote, or Governance will withdraw the funds in the Executive Vote using the MCD_Pause_Proxy beneficiary role on the multi-sig. If the Golden Parachute amounts is above the current balance in the Core Unit Multi-sig wallet, the following Executive Vote will distribute the difference to the Core Unit.  ",
