                    "content": "Hi members of the Maker community!  Paragraph Summary This post outlines a partnership proposal between Paxos and MakerDAO to mutually benefit from an increased amount of Pax Dollar (USDP) in the PSM. Paxos will send MakerDAO monthly marketing fees worth 45% of the Effective Federal Funds Rate (as specified below) on the USDP in the PSM for MakerDAO to promote the use of USDP within the Maker ecosystem and increase the USDP PSM Debt Ceiling to 1.5B USDP.  Motivation  Help MakerDAO earn revenue on PSM collateral while maintaining on-chain liquidity  Given the current US federal interest rate of ~4.3%, the full USDP PSM would be able to generate up to $29M in annual revenue for MakerDAO  The marketing fees are defined to automatically reflect interest rate changes and will not expire after a set amount of time.   The USDP will stay in the PSM in order for the PSM to stay true to its original objective of creating on-chain liquidity to maintain DAI\u2019s peg during volatile market conditions  Paxos has strong partnerships with leading Market Makers that can help take advantage of any arbitrage opportunities and support DAI\u2019s peg by using the USDP PSM and issuing/redeeming USDP on the Paxos platform Paxos has experience working as a crypto infrastructure provider for other stablecoin issuers (e.g. BUSD) and can handle issuance or redemption of USDP of any size at any time     Eliminate single point of failure in the safest way possible  Currently, ~30% of DAI is collateralized by USDC and ~40% of new DAI is generated by USDC collateral. Increasing the USDP PSM debt ceiling can help reduce DAI\u2019s exposure to USDC in a safe and practical way due to USDP\u2019s transparency, regulation, liquidity & scale. Both Paxos and USDP are regulated and supervised by a prudential regulator, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  USDP is fully backed 1:1 by cash and debt instruments expressly guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government (e.g. US Treasuries), including reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by such debt instruments, or money-market funds composed of such debt instruments. Because USDP is regulated by a primary prudential regulator, it can legally be backed only by cash & cash equivalents Reserves are fully segregated from corporate assets, specifically for the benefit of token holders, and are held bankruptcy remote pursuant to the New York Banking Law. Monthly reserve attestation reports from leading independent accounting firm & portfolio composition reports are available on Paxos\u2019 website    As an infrastructure provider, Paxos does not have a large retail business and therefore does not directly compete with Maker for customers.   Proposal Details This proposal has been developed in partnership with the Strategic Finance Core Unit and the Growth Core Unit to be best aligned with MakerDAO\u2019s incentives.  Implementation  Paxos will be paying Monthly Marketing Fees to MakerDAO, starting the day the changes are implemented on-chain. The Marketing Fees will be calculated daily as the product of 1) the balance of USDP within the USDP PSM, 2) the Effective Federal Funds Rate as published daily on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s website, 3) 45% & 4) 1/365 The Daily Marketing Fees will be aggregated on the last business day of the month and then reported to MakerDAO\u2019s Strategic Finance Core Unit by the 15th calendar day of the subsequent month and paid by Paxos in USDP on chain to MakerDAO\u2019s Surplus Buffer wallet (0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB) by the 30th calendar day of the subsequent month The Daily Marketing Fees will only be paid if the USDP PSM\u2019s Max Debt Ceiling is at or above a threshold of 1.5B USDP during that day. This threshold will increase to 2B USDP in 2024.   Memorandum of Understanding (link)  If this proposal is approved, Paxos will sign a non-binding arrangement with RWA, the Cayman Foundation created by MakerDAO for the purpose of contracting with legal entities (see MIP 58). The MoU does not create any contractual obligations, since legal enforcement would be impractical given the decentralized nature of MakerDAO. The MoU is instead guaranteed through aligned incentives. In parallel, the Strategic Finance CU will work on the last  items necessary to set up the partnership (e.g. DAO resolution for RWA\u2019s signature, documentation needed for Paxos\u2019 Due Diligence process, etc.).   Proposed parameters for the USDP PSM  Max Debt Ceiling: $1,500M Target Available Debt (gap): $1,000M Fee in (tin): 0bps Fee out (tout): 20bps  We look forward to hearing the community\u2019s feedback.

Couple of notes / questions:     Paxos:  Eliminate single point of failure in the safest way possible   Given that MakerDAO would still have existential exposure to USDC, I\u2019m not sure its realistic to say this eliminates a point of failure.  Are there any specific requirements on Maker\u2019s side related to marketing USDP in the Maker ecosystem other than the change in system parameters?  1.5B feels like a very high threshold for Maker to receive a share of the underlying value generated by the USD backing USDP, especially since the current market cap is less than 1B (and a large portion is already in Maker\u2019s PSM). Could I ask why this threshold was chosen, and why it is increasing to 2B in 2024? Naively it seems to me that 500M or 1B of USDP in the PSM would still benefit Paxos. Edit: I think I slightly misunderstood, mistaking the debt ceiling requirement for an amount-minted requirement. However, given the tout and the fact it benefits Paxo\u2019s more for it to be full, I don\u2019t believe there will be a meaningful difference between the two in practice. ",

                    "content": "My personal view on the topic; Given the history of Maker and Paxos relations, I would be much more convinced in Paxos, if you chose to commit to revenue sharing at the current point in time instead of demanding 1B additional debt ceiling with even higher ambitions down the line. Maker already holds close to 50% of all USDP supply and in the past this figure was even higher than it is today. The figure is likely higher in reality, if we discount the USDP held in Paxos owned addresses. To my knowledge, Paxos used pre minted USDP to fill the PSM initially in the past, so I can only assume the available debt ceiling will be used in a similar manner. If we consider holdings of USDP, some accounts seem to be related to Paxos. There is a high probability, imo, that these tokens are just sitting there to boost total supply and make it look better than it actually is, as was the case in the past. This is only an assumption, but I can\u2019t explain some of the largest holders of USDP, who seem to only hold the tokens and do nothing with them; why would anyone do something like this, when USDC is clearly preferable for any holder due to its significantly greater salability in crypto space and DeFi specifically; USDC is listed on almost every CEX and on-chain protocol, while presence of USDP is very limited in comparison. USDP is completely illiquid, similar to GUSD - it is costly and problematic to unload, especially in a fast manner. Maker is thus already assuming significant risk, which is why I think Paxos should commit to immediate revenue sharing and then ask for an increase, when Maker actually gets some value for current exposure. Another aspect of this proposal is that the primary function of PSM reserves is to maintain the dai peg. Currently, only USDC is able to perform this function as it has sufficient liquidity on-chain and general adoption by the market, thus, the majority of reserves should be allocated to it. If this proposal were to be accepted and implemented, USDP would likely become the largest stablecoin reserve, which is in my opinion not rational; 1B demand for dai can vanish in no time, at which point, USDC would be depleted from the reserves and due to illiquidity of USDP and GUSD, dai would depeg, especially during holidays and weekends, when the legacy financial system is offline. This would then undermine the whole purpose of why Maker ever even considered dealing with the centralized stablecoin assets in the first place. ",

Some points to consider, first, would it be possible to have more frequent payouts. Maker is used to transact on the block level, and while this probably cannot be expected from centralized counterparties, a two-weekly payout or shorter is preferable. Second:     Paxos:  The Daily Marketing Fees will only be paid if the USDP PSM\u2019s Max Debt Ceiling is at or above a threshold of 1.5B USDP during that day. This threshold will increase to 2B USDP in 2024.   This is very much on the high end. While we\u2019re aware that Paxos has multiple stablecoins USDP currently only has 911m USDP outstanding, and only hit the 1.5B market cap one single time, during a peak in May 2021 (a bit shy of 1.5B tbh)  image1703\u00d7973 69.8 KB  So we\u2019d be much more comfortable if the yield would be paid out from a substantially lower threshold.

Having looked over the summary, as well as the linked MoU draft, we think this is conceptually a very strong offer. This is also an excellent opportunity for MakerDAO to standardize how it treats various stable assets within the protocol. A number of stakeholders have arranged to meet with the issuers of GUSD. A similar meeting for USDP would allow the sharing of some ideas on how to refine the marketing incentive share to a more appropriate level, as well as establish a path to provide a risk analysis by professional, external, well-known third parties with the required expertise to set MKR holders\u2019 minds at ease. Again, thank you to Paxos and the core units who got this rough draft to the forum. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing this proposal polished into a product that can be quickly and proudly be delivered to MKR holders with just a few more tweaks. ",

As far as I know, no one is suing Paxos, Paxos is not suing anyone or otherwise entangled in the fraud/bankruptcy/default/contagion maelstrom engulfing us. (I consider Coinbase entangled as Custodian for DCG/Grayscale/GBTC and while Coinbase will share proof of BTC held onchain for the Osprey Bitcoin Trust, for some reason Grayscale says they have a \u201csecurity\u201d issue with similar disclosure. That\u2019s for another conversation.) How do we feel about Circle today? Is anyone looking into it actively? Are we aware of any enforcement actions, investigations, or financial distress situations with the U.S. banks holding USD reserves or shadow bank firms holding the treasuries backing USDC? We do not yet have a strong practice and process in place to ask such questions and dynamically evaluate the facts as an organization. My point here is not to trigger anyone who thinks all is well. The POINT is that as long as MakerDAO is not well staffed or structured to analyze all the angles, legal proceedings, etc. and respond nimbly and in a narrowly constructive way, either technically or from a governance perspective\u2026 \u2026it seems like diversification with this proposal is an obvious thing we can and SHOULD do to make the ecosystem support MakerDAO provides DeFi more resilient. (I do know about the BUSD concerns, but) as for USDP from where I sit as an outsider without further discussion, information or education other than a few minutes reading this thread\u2026 we are entering very uncharted waters industry wide. Scaling up with Paxos would be good to do right now. P.S. Also, I really like the Memo of Understanding.     Paxos:  The MoU does not create any contractual obligations, since legal enforcement would be impractical given the decentralized nature of MakerDAO. The MoU is instead guaranteed through aligned incentives.   It\u2019s creative, elegant and a useful belt and suspenders for the unusual set of relationships at play. ",

We operate with similar assumptions related to WBTC and LSDs - it should not depeg more than ~x at any time, as at sufficient discount, there will be plenty of demand, even if they need to wait a few days to close the trade. But in the eyes of dai holders, even a small discount is a cause for concern - discount is much more problematic than a premium from their perspective, especially after the recent collapse of many other stablecoins. Volatility, even when small, is not desirable. We want to offer the best possible user experience and demonstrate the stability and robustness of dai. From the perspective of debt in the system, discount directly negates the purchasing power of minted debt, especially RWA debt, as they operate with thinner margins and can not afford losing ~x% of capital just because banks do not operate at the time. The main reason for establishing PSM was dai stability, which obviously came with high cost and reputational damage in the crypto space. It would be a large pivot in strategy, to put the peg stability as less important in the prioritisation list. ",

On an overall level, having the PSM helps stabilize the peg and brings stability to the wider system. It is very pleasant to see Paxos present such a partnership. That being said there is a few parts that should be improved. In broad strokes that is the degree of revenue share, and transparency. To start with the degree of revenue share. Maker has through various mechanisms shown an ability to turn any stablecoin held in our PSMs into revenue. When this is done Maker receives the full revenue from said stablecoin. Due to our commitment to honor any request to exchange stablecoin for stablecoin we do have to keep a certain reserve. As such there is some value in being able to keep stablecoins directly in the PSM. Given the choice between 45% of revenue or 100% of revenue it seems like 100% is the superior option. As such I think such an agreement would need to move closer to 75% in Maker\u2019s favor to make financial sense for Maker. This is also disregarding the requirement to increase our debt ceiling to $1,5 Bn that seems excessive given the current circulating supply of USDP. Increasing the DC to these levels is hard to justify given the level of risk it exposes Maker to. Secondly is the level of transparency. While I don\u2019t doubt that Paxos has USDP fully backed 1:1 in a combination of cash and debt instruments, we do not know the exact combination of these instruments. Neither do we know the full risk they constitute. When Maker deploys stablecoins it retains full control of the risk profile of the placements. As such I think it would be in both Paxos and Maker\u2019s interest to have a third party evaluate the combined risk of Paxos\u2019 holdings. Preferably this third party would be a recognized rating agency. ",

There are no other explicit requirements apart from increasing the USDP PSM debt ceiling. However, our goal is to continue to build on this proposal and potentially partner with MakerDAO on other strategic projects.      LongForWisdom:  Could I ask why this threshold was chosen, and why it is increasing to 2B in 2024?   Increasing USDP PSM Debt Ceiling to $1.5B would allow for more than half of DAI\u2019s stablecoin collateral to be held in bankruptcy-remote trusts. Paxos can offer a layer of protection for consumers that few others in the digital assets space can offer by holding all reserve assets bankruptcy-remote. Because Paxos has a Limited Purpose Trust charter from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), New York Banking Law states in the unlikely event that Paxos Trust became insolvent, assets would not go through standard bankruptcy procedures like other companies (e.g. FTX, Alameda, Genesis, etc.). Instead, the assets held in custody by Paxos Trust would be directly returned to their rightful owners (i.e. USDP token holders). The last year has shown that customer asset protection is paramount for the industry to grow and mature. Consumer protection has always been central to Paxos\u2019 mission, which is why we have pursued the highest regulatory oversight within the crypto space both with the NYDFS in 2015 and soon with the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).

Additionally, and unlike USDC, USDP has historically and always will maintain its 1:1 dollar backing.      rema:  USDP is completely illiquid, similar to GUSD - it is costly and problematic to unload, especially in a fast manner.       rema:  1B demand for dai can vanish in no time, at which point, USDC would be depleted from the reserves and due to illiquidity of USDP and GUSD, dai would depeg, especially during holidays and weekends, when the legacy financial system is offline.   Any onboarded customer of Paxos can redeem USDP at any time (24/7/365), at face value (1 token = $1 USD). Paxos\u2019 stablecoin reserve portfolio is extremely liquid and is built to be able to facilitate large amounts of redemptions in a very short period of time. Despite the differences in market capitalization and branding, Paxos manages the issuance and management of both USDP and BUSD on Ethereum. The operations and  the liquidity of USDP and BUSD are materially similar. In December 2022, Paxos facilitated in excess of $3.2bn of BUSD redemptions in less than 24-hours. The liquidity of our portfolio allowed us to manage such material redemption values without issue. If the demand for DAI were to quickly drop and threaten the peg, Paxos would be able to support the redemption of any amount of USDP necessary to maintain the peg . ",

Maker is used to transact on the block level, and while this probably cannot be expected from centralized counterparties, a two-weekly payout or shorter is preferable.   More frequent payouts are unfortunately not possible at the moment as our current processes are based on monthly payouts. However, the aligned incentives should ensure that Paxos follows the processes & terms in the MoU and distribute payments accordingly (otherwise MakerDAO can wind down the USDP PSM).  Please also note that the only condition for the marketing fees to be paid is increasing the USDP PSM debt ceiling. It is not dependent on the actual amount of USDP in the PSM because the actual amount of USDP in the PSM is not directly in MakerDAO\u2019s control, so we decided not to include such condition (e.g. marketing fees would still be paid with only 100M USDP in the PSM).

Paxos has not been significantly affected by the contagion from the recent market turmoil and the latest crypto collapses (e.g. FTX, Alameda, Genesis, etc.). Additionally, stablecoin reserves are always protected because Paxos is legally required to fully segregate reserve assets in bankruptcy remote accounts so any type of exposure to bankrupted players would not affect customers. More information on this topic can be found in our blog post.  USDP Reserves Because Paxos and USDP are regulated by a prudential regulator (the New York Department of Financial Services),by regulatory mandate USDP reserves can only be invested in cash or cash equivalents (e.g. US Treasuries with maturity <90 days or repurchase agreements collateralized by US Treasuries), which is not the case for other major centralized stablecoins.The regulatory framework that Paxos adheres to can be found here. Further, on a monthly basis, Paxos engages an independent third-party to perform an examination over the adequacy of our reserves versus the market capitalization of the respective token. Paxos publicly publishes such reports on our website upon issuance.  BUSD concerns Please note that the concerns regarding BUSD are related to the Binance-wrapped version of BUSD on other chains (e.g. BSC), not BUSD natively issued by Paxos on Ethereum.

                    "content": "One of the key benefits of the USDP PSM compared to other sources of yield-bearing collateral is that the USDP is remaining in MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain custody at all times. This helps minimize counterparty risk as MakerDAO is not relying on a third party for custody (E.g. Coinbase) & increases DAI\u2019s peg stability since collateral assets are instantly redeemable if a depeg event were to happen. Additionally, Paxos can offer a layer of protection for consumers that few others in the digital assets space can offer by holding all reserve assets bankruptcy-remote. Because Paxos has a Limited Purpose Trust charter from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), New York Banking Law states in the unlikely event that Paxos Trust became insolvent, USDP reserves would not go through standard bankruptcy procedures like other companies and would instead be directly returned to their rightful owners (i.e. USDP token holders).     JustinCase:  Secondly is the level of transparency. While I don\u2019t doubt that Paxos has USDP fully backed 1:1 in a combination of cash and debt instruments, we do not know the exact combination of these instruments. Neither do we know the full risk they constitute. When Maker deploys stablecoins it retains full control of the risk profile of the placements. As such I think it would be in both Paxos and Maker\u2019s interest to have a third party evaluate the combined risk of Paxos\u2019 holdings. Preferably this third party would be a recognized rating agency.   Paxos is a leader in transparency in the stablecoin industry and was the first stablecoin issuer to develop monthly reserve holdings reports that provide a full statement of instruments backing USDP (see more information on Paxos\u2019 website). Because Paxos and USDP are regulated by a prudential regulator (the New York Department of Financial Services), by regulatory mandate USDP reserves can only consist of cash or certain cash equivalents (e.g. US Treasuries with maturity <90 days or reverse repurchase agreements overcollateralized by US Treasuries), which is not the case for most major centralized stablecoins.The regulatory framework that Paxos adheres to can be found here. Monthly reserve attestation reports from a independent third-party accounting firm (WithumSmith+Brown, PC) are issued monthly and available on Paxos\u2019 website ",
