                    "content": "Help Wanted: Writers for Stakeholder Content Program at COM-001 Welcome, fellow community member  Governance Communications Core Unit is looking for proficient English writers with some experience and/or knowledge of DeFi terminology, current events, and general MakerDAO stuff. A bit of background: MakerDAO stakeholders face many difficulties; keeping up with the growing volume and complexity of information, spending too much time searching, filtering noise, understanding Maker lingo, inability to make it to all the meetings, and more. The motivation for the Governance Communications Core Unit is to improve MakerDAO\u2019s performance as a public organization by removing information and communication barriers for stakeholders and community members. The vision for stakeholder programs is simple; to provide relevant and informative content at a general level that the broad audience can easily understand. Types of Stakeholder Programs: Stakeholder programs are recurring publications posted by Governance Communications such as Forum at a Glance, Weekly Relay, Monthly Governance Review, Monthly Core Unit Updates, and more. These programs are written and published on a recurring basis; some are weekly, and others are monthly. Below are the most recent references to these publications:  Weekly Relay State of Dai Forum at a Glance Monthly Governance Review Monthly Core Unit Updates  Help Wanted! As the number of Core Units and information output continues to scale, it is difficult to keep up with information organization and publication deadlines. If anyone believes they are a good fit to join COM-001 as a contributor for producing these publications, we encourage you to contact us. If there are any inquiries regarding this post or contributor position, feel free to message me or post on this thread. Thank you!
