I sent virtual currency to Tornado Cash but did not complete the mixing transaction or otherwise withdraw my virtual currency before Tornado Cash\u2019s August 8, 2022 designation. How can I complete the transaction or withdraw my virtual currency without violating U.S. sanctions regulations? For transactions involving Tornado Cash that were initiated prior to its designation on August 8, 2022 but not completed by the date of designation, U.S. persons or persons conducting transactions within U.S. jurisdiction may request a specific license from OFAC to engage in transactions involving the subject virtual currency. U.S. persons should be prepared to provide, at a minimum, all relevant information regarding these transactions with Tornado Cash, including the wallet addresses for the remitter and beneficiary, transaction hashes, the date and time of the transaction(s), as well as the amount(s) of virtual currency. OFAC would have a favorable licensing policy towards such applications, provided that the transaction did not involve other sanctionable conduct. In order to apply for a specific license to complete a transaction or withdraw virtual currency involving Tornado Cash that was deposited prior to its designation, or to engage in other transactions or dealings with Tornado Cash, you are encouraged to file a licensing request by visiting the following link: OFAC License Application Page | U.S. Department of the Treasury. Released on 09/13/2022 Cyber-related Sanctions  1078. Do OFAC reporting obligations apply to \u201cdusting\u201d transactions? OFAC is aware of reports following the designation of Tornado Cash that certain U.S. persons may have received unsolicited and nominal amounts of virtual currency or other virtual assets from Tornado Cash, a practice commonly referred to as \u201cdusting.\u201d Technically, OFAC\u2019s regulations would apply to these transactions. To the extent, however, these \u201cdusting\u201d transactions have no other sanctions nexus besides Tornado Cash, OFAC will not prioritize enforcement against the delayed receipt of initial blocking reports and subsequent annual reports of blocked property from such U.S. persons. For guidance related to filing an initial and annual report of blocked property, please see FAQs 49, 50, and 646, respectively, and 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 501.603. Please note that the annual filing requirement for 2022 applies only to persons holding blocked property as of June 30 of this year. Released on 09/13/2022 Cyber-related Sanctions  1077. Can U.S. persons engage in transactions involving identified Tornado Cash virtual currency wallet addresses absent a specific license from OFAC? No. U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in transactions involving Tornado Cash, including through the virtual currency wallet addresses that OFAC has identified. If U.S. persons were to initiate or otherwise engage in a transaction with Tornado Cash, including or through one of its wallet addresses, such a transaction would violate U.S. sanctions prohibitions, unless exempt or authorized by OFAC. Released on 09/13/2022 Cyber-related Sanctions  1076. What is prohibited as a result of OFAC\u2019s designation of Tornado Cash? On August 8, 2022, OFAC designated the entity Tornado Cash for facilitating the laundering of proceeds of cybercrimes, including those committed by the Lazarus Group, a North Korea state-sponsored hacking group that was sanctioned in 2019. As described in FAQs 561 and 562, OFAC may include as identifiers on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) specific virtual currency wallet addresses associated with blocked persons. As part of the SDN List entry for Tornado Cash, OFAC included as identifiers certain virtual currency wallet addresses associated with Tornado Cash, as well as the URL address for Tornado Cash\u2019s website. The Tornado Cash website has since been deleted from the Internet, but it currently remains available through certain Internet archives. While engaging in any transaction with Tornado Cash or its blocked property or interests in property is prohibited for U.S. persons, interacting with open-source code itself, in a way that does not involve a prohibited transaction with Tornado Cash, is not prohibited. For example, U.S. persons would not be prohibited by U.S. sanctions regulations from copying the open-source code and making it available online for others to view, as well as discussing, teaching about, or including open-source code in written publications, such as textbooks, absent additional facts. Similarly, U.S. persons would not be prohibited by U.S. sanctions regulations from visiting the Internet archives for the Tornado Cash historical website, nor would they be prohibited from visiting the Tornado Cash website if it again becomes active on the Internet.

Well I started reading about tornado cash sanctions an hour ago, and I have some questions, \u2192 With the advent and implementation of tornado cash sanctions, do you think the future of crypto will be affected greatly when compared to it\u2019s disadvantage. Would Crypto future be centralized or decentralized \u2192 How do I prevent my wallet from being blacklisted \u2192 Would the official recognition of BTC as a commodity under the regulatory preview of the CTFC prevent OFAC from doing a similar type of action against BTC?

Freakytainment:  Would Crypto future be centralized or decentralized   I would say, this is up to us!   But note, there are many ways to define both of those words. It\u2019s a spectrum with interdependent components that are also on their own operating within varying parameters of what decentralization means, and can mean.     Freakytainment:  \u2192 How do I prevent my wallet from being blacklisted    no comment     Freakytainment:  Would the official recognition of BTC as a commodity under the regulatory preview of the CTFC prevent OFAC from doing a similar type of action against BTC?   Nothing can prevent any person, regulatory authority, government, agency etc. from taking an action they are empowered to take. The likelihood of such actions or threat of action can be assessed ex-ante by a number of factors, such as how clear law and enforcement precedent (including judicial determinations) are on the question. In our case here at MakerDAO, we are on the front lines of the frontier, so there is very little clarity (there is SOME). Until a greater body of specific laws addressing the new possibilities crypto has unlocked have been passed, we are in the mud and mire of authorities shooting first, asking questions later or never. Even then, interpretation of laws that comes from decided court cases is really what we need to settle all these questions. This will take many years, so even after laws are passed there\u2019s a very established method to challenge and interpret how those laws are being applied. I for one believe the strong Rule of Law in the United States means we\u2019re actually a great place to operate from. The U.S. Constitution and jurisprudence provide the best protection of personal and property rights the world has ever seen (at least historically speaking to a point). It has been the underpinning of the former colony becoming a global super empire. And now - well\u2026 What to do! What do you do when someone has a gun and shoots you, even though that\u2019s against the law? Well, that\u2019s the kind of the situation we are in. You have to deal with the fall out, hope you survive the attack and then get redress ex-post via some process (outcomes uncertain). Of course there are things you can do to greatly reduce the chance of being confronted by the gunman in the first place. That\u2019s the debate here about compliance, how to think about that, to what extent we can do it, and will it save us. And even if it does, is that a life worth living? ",
