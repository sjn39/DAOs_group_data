We had a short session at the Berlin council, and I\u2019ve spoken to a number of people who\u2019ve expressed interest, so I thought I\u2019d ask. Is it too late to start a new Ring before Prague?  Here are some of the issues we could discuss (these are off the top of my head - not even sure if all of them make sense):  Is there a long-term solution to the ever-growing data on chain? Can it possibly grow unbounded forever? Can the nodes provide better fine-grained control of what data is stored by the nodes? Is the community in danger of being \u201ccaptured\u201d by efforts such as EtherScan, Infura, Google Big Table, CloudFlare which are fully centralized? Can off-chain data providers be forced to prove they\u2019ve not manipulated the data they deliver? What minimum data requirements do different types of users need: * dApp devs * Regular everyday non-dev users of smart contract * Everyday users who don\u2019t use smart contracts * Auditors / Accountants * Industry analists Does each different user type need the same or different solutions? What happens to existing solutions (blockchain explorers) when the chain shards? Will solutions we build apply to multiple different chains (Polkadot, Plasma)? Will each Plasma chain have its own explorer? Does it make sense to have different solutions for different standards (i.e ERC20 explorer, 721 Explorer)? Are there viable business models for providers of already consented-to data?  Should there be business models and/or \u2018data marketplaces\u2019 or does that lead to haves and have-nots? How can the nodes be improved related to (a) lessening storage requirements, (b) deliver more useful data, \u00a9 easing extraction of data for specific uses. Can the RPCs be improved? New end points? Missing or extraneous params to existing end points. Are the RPCs on all clients consistent? Are the RPCs well documented?  This is totally just a start. Any help you\u2019all can give is appreciated, of course. Maybe there\u2019s two tracks here. One about the on-chain data and other about the extraction and use of off-chain data. Even if we don\u2019t have time to form a ring, perhaps we can have a birds-of-a-feather ad-hoc meeting at the Prague council. ",

                    "content": "Thanks so much for your comments.     Ethernian:    [CoreDev] Is there a long-term solution to the ever-growing data on chain? Can it possibly grow unbounded forever?    The core devs would implement this, yes, but we can discuss the various options. I may have missed it, but I don\u2019t remember seeing any EIPs related to this. It ties in with the next item.     Ethernian:    [CoreDev] Can the nodes provide better fine-grained control of what data is stored by the nodes?    Again, I don\u2019t see any EIPs concerning this issue. As an example, I can choose to run --pruning archive or not and I get either 1.5 TB or much, much less. Can I have pruning archive:4000000? In other words, archive, but only back to block 4,000,000. It\u2019s obviously possible because you can go from no archive to all archive. Can we get partial archive? Or how about '\u2013pruning archive:six weeks back` where the node constantly keeps six weeks of full history. In that six week (or ten, or 52, or whatever), the user can extract whatever data they want from the node, and be able to reclaim space that is needlessly kept now. This group can help the CoreDevs understand how useful this would be. Obviously, they don\u2019t see that given the lack of any EIPs related to something like this.     Ethernian:    [Global] Is the community in danger of being \u201ccaptured\u201d by efforts such as EtherScan, Infura, Google Big Table, CloudFlare which are fully centralized? ==>unclear what danger do you mean     Most of my concerns are about the data after it\u2019s been extracted from the chain, as is done with the recent Google Big Table effort. Google may be building that database for the world out of the kindness of their heart, but my guess is that they hope people will build applications on that data. Over time, the more people rely on using convenience tools such as APIs built on off-chain data, the more Google has the potential of capturing those applications making it impossible for them to move to other solutions. Google\u2019s pitch: Check out this amazing data, it\u2019s been agreed to by the entire world, ignore the fact that it\u2019s only available through our APIs due to the astronomical size of the data otherwise.     Ethernian:    [Oracles?] Can off-chain data providers be forced to prove they\u2019ve not manipulated the data they deliver?    Again, I\u2019m referring to off-chain data. (I think of Oracles going the other way from outside to in \u2013 I\u2019m talking about inside to out.) . For example, I can use EtherScan\u2019s API to retrieve a list of transactions on my account, but they simply send that data to me. I might build an accounting or auditing solution on that API, but how do I know that EtherScan has not made a mistake or is purposefully altering the data? And, getting back to the \u2018capture\u2019 issue, if (as is true of EtherScan) they make additions to the data (for example adding is_error flags to transactions without being explicit, moving your app to another API will that much more difficult. If instead, APIs that provided off-chain data were explicit about how they derived that data, moving to other providers would be easier. In the best of all worlds, the nodes themselves would be easy enough to run and the access to the data from the node would be useful enough that we wouldn\u2019t need third party APIs such as EtherScan and Big Table.     Ethernian:    [DataRing] What minimum data requirements do different types of users need:       dApp devs    These users want deep analytics on everything that happens on thier dapps across test and main nets.    Regular everyday non-dev users of smart contract    This user wants to know where their money is and wants to keep a (potentially close) watch on the smart contract she interacts with.    Everyday users who don\u2019t use smart contracts    This user just wants to know where their money is.    Auditors / Accountants    This user wants full details of everything including all incoming and outgoing transactions (both internal and external) as well as all events.    Industry analists    This user wants cross-block summary statistics, etc.     Ethernian:    [DataRing] Does each different user type need the same or different solutions? ==> You mean different client?     I mean different users have different needs. As a way to increase the number of people who run nodes (which would be beneficial to everyone), the nodes could provide more options to different types of people.     Ethernian:    [CoreDev] What happens to existing solutions (blockchain explorers) when the chain shards?    Does anyone see any conversation anywhere about this issue? Whenever I ask people (in person) they literally say \u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d  How is EtherScan preparing for sharding? How is Infura preparing for sharding? How are the other open source blockchain explorers preparing or sharding? How about privacy-laden transactions when we start incorporating Z-cash like transactions?     Ethernian:    [CoreDev] Will solutions we build apply to multiple different chains (Polkadot, Plasma)?    Why core devs? I\u2019m talking about blockchain data. If things work out as they seem to be headed, everyone\u2019s data is going to be coming from multiple sources. Does anyone actually think that\u2019s going to work?     Ethernian:    [CoreDev, DataRing] Will each Plasma chain have its own explorer? ==> I think, yes. DataRing can aim to establish common data interchange standart     Is this Polkadot? (I\u2019m not sure.) [quote=\u201cEthernian, post:2, topic:1438\u201d]   [DataRing] Does it make sense to have different solutions for different standards (i.e ERC20 explorer, 721 Explorer)? ==> What do you mean by solution? [/qutoe]  Will there (or should there) arise different explorers/data solutions for the different standards? I.e. will there be different solutions for 721 land records vs. 721 game assets vs. 721 artwork vs. whatever?  Would 721 explorers be different (or should they be) than ERC20 explorers?     Ethernian:    [DataRing] Are there viable business models for providers of already consented-to data?  Should there be business models and/or \u2018data marketplaces\u2019 or does that lead to haves and have-nots? ==> Question unclear     The two previous questions try to get at the idea of a common good or community good. Is the consented-to data a community good? Should the community, who\u2019s spent all these resources to achieve the amazing feat of coming to agreement on world-wide data, allow themselves to end up in a place where they have to pay for the very data they created? Does the value of the data disappear if the only way we can get to for accounting or auditing purposes it is through a third party such as EtherScan or Google? This is particularly true if Google captures us and doesn\u2019t prove to us that they haven\u2019t manipulated the data. For me, it almost gets to the point where I ask why we\u2019re coming to agreement on the data anyway if we have to ask Google for accounting-quality data.     Ethernian:    [CoreDev] How can the nodes be improved related to (a) lessening storage requirements, (b) deliver more useful data, (c ) easing extraction of data for specific uses.    The core devs aren\u2019t doing this. I think they don\u2019t see it as a problem (this is based on the fact that we see articles arguing why 1.5 TB is not a problem).     Ethernian:    [CoreDev, DataRing] Can the RPCs be improved? New end points? Missing or extraneous params to existing end points. Are the RPCs on all clients consistent? Are the RPCs well documented? ==> DataRing can create a spec and let implement CoreDev adopt it.     The one thing here that I think would be a good place to start is to try to get the Parity and Geth RPCs related to tracing to agree. If you want to build audit-quality or accounting-quality data, you really need traces. Parity\u2019s traces are pretty good here, Geth\u2019s not so much. ",

Cost to make the information meaningful and useful.   The costs might be born by each member of the community if we can think of ways to promote more people running more nodes that produce much better access to the data. The trouble with cost, I think, comes from the \u2018blockchain explorer\u2019 mentality where all the data is extracted from the chain and then somehow re-delivered to the end users. If the node could be made more light-weight and at the same time deliver higher quality results, more people would run more nodes and the costs would be spread out.     jpitts:  Without designing for open and low-cost access, we open up the possibility of new monopolies or other barriers forming around the tremendous amount of data that will be generated by blockchains and L2 networks.   Intuitively, it seems to me that the only workable way to insure \u2018low-cost\u2019 is for each participant to bear the cost of the data themselves, but only the cost burden created by their own activity.

A list of addresses that appears in a given block can be directly derived from the block, but it is no-where explicitly represented. It is this \u2018derived\u2019 data that will, as Jamie puts it, create opportunities for monopolies.
