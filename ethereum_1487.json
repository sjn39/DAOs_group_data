I will be at the following events in the near future:  WalletConnect Community meeting (this Thursday after securETH) ETHBerlin (this weekend) Token Ring Meetup (Sunday directly after ETHBerlin: Token Ring Meetup: ETHBerlin) Wallet UX Unconference (Monday after ETHBerlin) CryptoLife (the status.im Hackathon before Ethereum Magicians) Ethereum Magicians Prague DevCon 4  Would be great if we could meet at some of these events! Let me know if you attend one or more of these events and if you have ideas if/how we should frame things. ",
