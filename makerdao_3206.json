                    "content": "DAI debt of ETH-A vault type continues to increase and it is becoming hard for governance to react fast enough so that the debt ceiling doesn\u2019t get not fully utilized. We believe Debt Ceiling IAM is needed and preferred for ETH-A vault type. Given that there are no other contents for the executive proposal this week and that there is uncertainty over the demand for the ETH-A vault-type in the coming weeks, this change will be put up as an executive vote on Friday.  Parameters Proposed  line  We have a pending signal request on potential DC increase of ETH-A and currently the 1.5bn debt ceiling is winning with about 55% approval. As @Risk-Core-Unit already mentioned in forums and on Governance & Risk call, the ETH exposure is starting to become an issue for overall portfolio risk as VaR levels don\u2019t match Maker\u2019s protection at hand currently (low surplus buffer, low box, liquidation 2.0 not released yet,\u2026). On the other hand there are valid concerns about integration risks of ETH-A if the debt ceiling gets fully utilized. Also it seems the community supports higher LR ETH-C proposal, but I am not sure if we got a clear signal whether potential ETH-C implementation also assumes limiting ETH-A debt exposure. Having all this in mind and trying to satisfy community preference we can continue to increase ETH-A Debt ceiling but then mitigate risks differently, with higher SF. Here we want to make sure that people are aware that stronger measures may need to take place to counter the increased risk from ETH-A exposure. This includes, but is not limited to: increasing the ETH-A SF at a more rapid pace, increasing the surplus buffer and increasing the box. This is because the aim of higher SF would not only be to protect Maker, but also to lower the pace of ETH-A debt exposure increase. Note that higher SF doesn\u2019t offer short term protection of increased debt exposure. We propose line parameter for DC IAM ETH-A to be set to 1.5bn, matching current community expectations and also high enough to make sense using DC IAM.  gap  As already mentioned in our DC IAM analysis, we either want a combination of low \u2018gap\u2019 and low \u2018ttl\u2019 or combination of high gap and high ttl. You don\u2019t want to be making low DC adjustments too rarely and you don\u2019t want to be making high DC adjustments too frequently. We believe a higher gap is preferred for ETH-A. We saw how whale Vault users can mint 20m DAI or more instantly and we don\u2019t want to prevent this since Maker is uniquely positioned in DeFi lending space to allow such mints without affecting the rate instantly. Downside of higher gap value is OSM risk, but since OSM risks are much lower for ETH-A vaults, we don\u2019t think this could be a huge issue. Also we may want to make sure that enough unutilized debt ceiling can be available in case of DAI liquidity crunch when some of the keepers or market makers still prefer to use ETH-A vault to meet market demand for DAI. Another reason for higher \u2018gap\u2019 is to prevent griefing attacks that we found for this IAM DC, but is less likely for someone to perform it since there are no benefits to it. Still, higher gap limits this attack severely. We propose a 30m gap value for DC IAM ETH-A Vault Type.  ttl  Since we have proposed a bit higher gap value we want the ttl parameter to match certain conditions. If we assume governance can react and prevent further minting in about 48 hours (current GSM delay), we may want to set ttl to match a number that prevents too high accumulation of debt on ETH-A before governance can react and stop minting. We believe ttl of 12 hours is a suitable number since it implies 120m max additional mints (48 GSM delay / 12h ttl x 30m gap) until governance can react and change DC. Further, this also enables 60m daily DAI mints on ETH-A, something we found to be quite common lately.  Proposed Parameters for DC IAM ETH-A Vault Type line = 1.500.000.000 DAI gap = 30.000.000 DAI ttl = 12 hours ",

ETH-A is up 70%+ YTD which is more growth than most businesses have in a year. I know we just increased the SB to 10M, but that post was made when the ETH-A exposure was at 466M and now we\u2019re at 867M, nearly double! If we raise the DC to 1.5B we could rapidly see ourselves in an untenable position if the markets turned and the SB yet to be filled. We should be working to avoid a BT situation where MKR has to be issued at dirt cheap prices, especially while we wait for liquidation 2.0 to be implemented. I agree with @flipflopflapdelegate 's concerns regarding the overall market and would encourage @Risk-Core-Unit to push proposals to mitigate the risk of the higher DC. I didn\u2019t see a single post in the SR to raise the DC supporting a 500M increase which is unfortunate given that option is currently leading the polls at 39%. I know we want to stay competitive with current market rates, but the rapid growth implies our SF is too low, I would rather increase SF to temper growth until risk is more comfortable with our position. I fully support @Primoz suggestion to move faster with ETH-A SF increases and the other risk mitigation measures. Moving quickly is an advantage we should leverage and will allow us to better manage the increased exposure. ",

Note that higher SF doesn\u2019t offer short term protection of increased debt exposure.   The above is the proper reaction and concerns.   Having vaults with different risk parameters and SFs also important too.

Work on building a reserve/treasury minimum 2% float (30M) Something like @SebVentures has done using real vault data and running them against real world price drop scenarios to model loss profiles and get a real risk analysis going on not just this vault but the other large and building vaults (wBTC in particular).  My concern here is with PSM governance is getting stuck into this:  \u201cwe need to constantly raise DC to accommodate demand\u201d and for some reason we are shying away from increasing SFs, building multiple vault tiers (with difference CR, SF, DC profiles) on particularly ETH but generally with a focus on our largest and growing vaults. My vote may not mean much but I may start tapping on the breaks here at least with my MKR rejecting increasing DCs and reiterating using the other tools (SF in particular, and building surplus, reserve/treasury) as a better reaction to managing demand than just letting DC run and hoping to hell we don\u2019t get trapped into a bad situation before we can bring on-line. Liq2.0 information regarding keeper status/state DAI liquidity sourcing (flash mint may work but will all of this work with gas at 2000gwei and above?) I am happy we have demand.  I think it is a great problem to have.  But we need to stop constantly and blindly raising DC and mostly ignoring SF as a demand management tool.  It took almost 15-20% in the SCD SF to finally tamp down demand which also coincided with a ETH price downturn in 2019 if I remember right.   We already are stuck between a rock and a hard place causing governance to put into place stablecoin vaults with huge DCs and LRs of 101 and finally the PSM to get the PEG under control. I have maintained a thesis since yield farming came on-line that once we could provide liquidity we literally needed to RAISE SF rates to tamp down demand (or get it under control).  At the time this was rejected because the PEG was running 1.02 to 1.04.  Now with PEG under control we can finally address demand with SF.   We need to be slow, but steady and consistent with approach given the completely new PSM situation. My biggest concern with Maker is that it has yet to seek to achieve any kind of steady state.  DAI either grows or declines.   I have never seen a real stable DAI demand situation.  But these markets are constantly changing and this requires US to constantly change as well.   We now have 1.5B outstanding, collateral what 2-3B under management we need to have some courage to do the right things both for the DAI and DeFI economy and develop the tools to monitor economic changes so we can respond more quickly and more accurately.   My own research indicates that Maker generally lags by at least 1-2 months what markets need, and often also tends to overshoot on each side (both with keeping rates too low for too long, and raising them too high for too long).   This was predominantly why I wanted some dynamism with rates relative to facility usage so the system could instantly and dynamically respond to market demands within bounds set by governance. ",

Notwithstanding the extra smart contract work required to activate an ETH-C vault-type, in the ideal world here is what I would want to see (not in any particular order but hopefully in close succession):  Set ETH-A DC-IAM to 1.5B with proposed parameters. Increase ETH-A SF as needed to keep total ETH-A exposure somewhat below 1.5B. Activate ETH-C with higher CR and SF 1-2% lower than ETH-A.  As demand for ETH-A increases I think more risk averse Vault-holders (like myself) would be happy to migrate to an ETH-C vault type for a lower rate. ",
