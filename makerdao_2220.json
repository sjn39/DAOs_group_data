I am the MakerDAO Ambassador for ACRE DAOs, a tokenized community of people and projects working towards the regeneration of our world through decentralized finance (aka \u201cRegenerative Finance\u201d or \u201cReFi\u201d). Ethereum wallet: acredaos.eth  INDICATION OF INTEREST IN CVC MEMBER RECOGNITION We are pleased to announce our interest in forming a Constitutional Voter Committee to represent the core values and priorities of ReFi. While we understand The Maker Constitution and pregame MIP set is still in its Request For Comment period, our hope is that formally introducing ourselves before the commencement of the Frozen period might assist with discussion during RFC. The purposes and values of MakerDAO as stated in the MIP101 draft have aroused interest in our community to join forces with you. By fulfilling all the requirements for becoming a Recognized CVC Member and operating a CVC, we intend to demonstrate the viability of core assumptions made here about the value of having a public good orientation:    MIP101: The Maker Constitution   1.1: The purpose of the Dai Stablecoin The central purpose and value of MakerDAO, the Maker Protocol, the Dai Stablecoin and its community and ecosystem, is providing people access to an Unbiased World Currency in the form of the decentralized stablecoin Dai.      MIP101: The Maker Constitution   1.2: Public Good Purpose To protect the long term integrity of its governance community, Maker will always share financial success with the world through charity that is distributed broadly and with thoughtful and genuine consideration of its impact. This permanent, guaranteed, direct action is necessary to lock in the core values of Maker and the Maker Constitution forever, even in the face of community misalignment, by ensuring aligned community members are always attracted to participate Maker Governance and are willing to volunteer to deal with misalignment issues.      MIP101: The Maker Constitution   1.3: Clean Money Clean Money is a core principle of the Maker Constitution that recognizes the unique critical relationship between financial infrastructure and the global environmental risks of climate change. To Support this effort, the Maker Constitution allocates a large initial amount of its MKR reserves as well as initial MKR token emissions from the Purpose System to be allocated towards a Clean Money Fund. This helps Maker deliver on the promise of Clean Money, while also ensuring that significant public good commitment is active from the moment the Maker Constitution is approved. This helps lock in the core values of Maker by attracting the right people to participate in Maker Governance, reducing the risk of community misalignment early on.    ABOUT US ACRE DAOs was formed through a public open call in December 2021 with organizational support and seed funding provided by ACREinvest through the Regenerate Hudson Opportunity Zone Fund in Hudson Valley, New York. Opportunity Zones in the United States are areas specially designated by the United States Department of the Treasury for tax-incentivized long-term investments in real property and small businesses located in economically distressed or disadvantaged areas. The timing of our founding corresponded with a unique moment of coalescence among regenerative economy practitioners and crypto builders around the world. The memes \u201cReFi\u201d and \u201cDegens to Regens\u201d began to take hold at that time within the wider DeFi narrative. We are proud to count many of the recognized trailblazers in the space today among our over 100 Founding Members, and dozens more that joined us during Season One (April - September 2022).  welcome new members1200\u00d7679 234 KB  Currently we are participants in MakerDAO governance by delegating the 0.1MKR we hold in our community treasury to @ACREinvest. A few active members of the MakerDAO community are part of the ACRE DAOs network, and joined us last year for monthly Community Calls in our Discord and weekly ACRE DAOs/MakerDAO Governance chats on Zoom.  WE LIKE THE ENDGAME We are revenge-of-the-nerds level excited about the Constitutional approach and CC mechanisms in the Endgame. Our network can contribute significantly in a number of specific areas regarding Scopes development in general, Advisory Council roles and specifically with respect to public goods and \u201cimpact\u201d themed product development and charity. For us the benefit would be gaining a substantial, tangible and specific opportunity to advance the Regeneration through the influence we might have in promoting the health and sustainability of the MakerDAO/DAI ecosystem of permissionless credit and useful money-like substitutes.  INCLUSION We would seek to host Subcommittee meetings at convenient times for the Global South, APAC and Americas (weekends/after work hours). It\u2019s important that we embody our principals in how we would operate the CVC and communicate, not only in what we advocate for in written form. We\u2019ll be interested in making sure the Ambassador program is looked after and expanded. And for MKR holders who lament the lack of strategy around adoption and business opportunities in Africa, India and a host of other important economies of the future - we are here for it!  OUR PRINCIPLES While the current crypto-denominated ReFi movement is nascent, diverse and very much open to interpretation, we are building upon an extensive history and tradition within scientific and technological progress.  Infographic-DeFi,ReFi,DeSci1000\u00d7562 268 KB  The contribution of our proposed Regenerative Finance CVC would be to evaluate the formation of the MakerDAO Constitution and all that it encompasses with a view toward the role an Unbiased World Currency can play in advancing the following 8 Principles of a Regenerative Economy:  In Right Relationship Views Wealth Holistically Innovative, Adaptive, Responsive Empowered Participation Honors Community and Place Edge Effect Abundance Robust Circulatory Flow Seeks Balance   thumbnail_8-Principles_no-icons-11280\u00d71280 286 KB   CONCLUSION Thanks for your time in reading this far! Happy to answer any questions. Most of all we encourage MakerDAO to continue well in all the smart and brave work you do. The Endgame plan strikes us as an organizational redesign capable of accomplishing the big vision while attracting the dynamism and aligned spirits you need to make it happen! The current scheduled timing and initiation of the pregame for April syncs perfectly with the start of our season this year. If approved and as appropriate, we\u2019d happily engage our marcomms team to coordinate with Growth and GovAlpha accordingly to cross promote the launch with our network.  acre daos season 21200\u00d7675 57.1 KB  We are on Twitter @ACREDAOs ~ Good News P.S.

                    "content": "Wow, this is really amazing to see. It\u2019s exactly initiatives like this that will give Maker a chance to survive in the long run. I\u2019m very interested in supporting this and making sure it is incubated alongside the 3 CVCs I plan to incubate myself as more business focused archetypes. Overall there is just so much potential to do amazing things, both in terms of helping to have a positive impact on the world, while also generating value for Maker by protecting the robustness of governance. I\u2019m such a big fan of this that I will consider providing some MKR to it in some way - exactly how will have to be figured out collectively with input from the community, so that we make sure it doesn\u2019t set the wrong precedent. But since you are more on the \u201cvisionary\u201d end rather than the \u201cMKR holder\u201d end, this could help the group members have a better chance of gaining the CVC Member participation rewards in the long run, and make the volunteer effort more sustainable. I immediately have a lot of practical thoughts about what will be important to get get completely clear and aligned on in order to make sure this will fully live up to its potential and be a net force for good. My impression is that you already get the underlying logic of the construct though, so this is probably all things you already consider obvious. I might also be pressing too hard on some of these points, and make wishes that are unrealistic, so it will be important to discuss this and figure out how we can set the right precedent. I hope that immediately replying to your awesome initiative with a giant of wall of text is not going to be taken as me being overly prescriptive or demanding, rather I just think that this is an extremely exciting opportunity to actually get to work on what successful governance within the confines of the Maker Constitution will actually look like practically, rather than theoretically. It is an amazing opportunity to take a hard look at the risks we are trying to mitigate and the benefits that we expect to gain. Maybe we will learn that there are some fundamental principles that don\u2019t hold up in practice and need to be changed. The most important place to start is to have public discussion about as many details as possible to get aligned and prepared for the next step.  1) CVCs need to be open and decentralized groups representing a \u201cgovernance archetype\u201d CVCs are meant to be open, decentralized Maker groups of like minded MKR holders that collaborate to make MKR as valueable as possible, and support the project and its vision as much as possible, through a strategy that they believe is the most value creating (for all MKR holders). While of course we cant enforce or guarantee that a CVC doesn\u2019t become a more closed group of friends, it is not a desirable outcome. I.e. it is important that its the overall alignment on the vision and values, rather than connections or relationships with the members. One really important way that this needs to be enforced from Makers side, in terms of eligibility of Constitutional Conserver recognition, is that a CVC cannot be branded or marked as controlled by particular external group. Obviously there can and should be close connections, relationships etc, but I think its important that the CVC is seen as a broader coalition than just ACRE DAO. My impression is that this already your intention, my point is more that I think its important to press this from the start, from a communications perspective, so we can make sure that the regenerative finance CVC is not seen as the capture of a piece of maker governance by a particular group (which could be good or bad, depending on the group), but seen as the birth of a new governance strategic archetype (which is always a net positive, since it just gives voters more choices within the secure boundary of the constitution).  2) CVCs are volunteer groups of MKR holders and visionaries It is really important that CVCs are always seen as only representing the interests of people who are MKR holders and want to improve the system economically (and this indirectly the public good value of the system), or who are supports of the Maker vision who want to improve the systems public good value (and thus indirectly its economic value as that is the main driver of how it delivers public good value). So this means that by being connected to a CVC, one should ideally not have other income streams in the Maker ecosystem than the CVC Member reward. The CVCs will be making all the key decisions about how it gets evaluated who gets paid etc, so it is a fundamental requirement that the whole ecosystem must be able to trust that there is no conflict of interest when these decisions are made (of course it will still happen in practice behind the scenes due to human nature, but if such behaviour is found out, it is a violation of the constitutional conserver requirements). This could also just involve transparency on conflict of interest and abstentions in decisions. But for instance, I think at least being a CVC member is going to make someone ineligible for the advisory council role, because CVCs and advisory councils are the two direct counterparts. Small scale involvement in other types of roles is less problematic, i think, as long as there are strong protections put in place by the advisory councils to ensure that all interactions with third parties are on an arms length basis and the scope frameworks simply prevent MKR holders from trying to influence who gets chosen, so an objective process can be turned into a political process and suddenly conflict of interest can become a major issue.  3) Clear constitutional distinction between when Maker Governance decisions are about business, when they are about public good impact, and when its both A fundamental pillar that will make this work is that Maker is both a value-seeking economic entity, and then at the same time, uses some of that economic value to contribute to public good to prevent it from corrupting culturally. Both of these elements must be kept in balance, so they can preserve each other, and the most important way to do this is with clear constitutional boundaries about what the objective for particular decisions should be.  Purpose system and Clean Money Fund The obvious places where decisions are entirely about public good only are the two purpose related constitutional elements: The purpose system, and the temporary Clean Money Fund.  Collateral allocation On the other hand, when it comes to collateral allocation, at the Maker Governance level, the decision must be only and entirely about maximizing yield and minimizing financial risk (to maker), with the exception of the exclusion list (which right now includes only coal, as even gas and oil cannot be excluded since they are fundamentally needed for society to function at this stage). It is very important that the simplicity and clear objective of collateral allocation is kept this way, in my opinion, as this is going to be the key element that ensures that there will be no attempt to change the purpose system or the clean money fund. This doesn\u2019t mean that Maker cannot actively allocate collateral and fund projects that produce a positive public good impact, rather it means that the way to achieve that is to use the Clean Money Fund and purpose system to influence public opinion and government priorities to ensure subsidies or loan guarantees are made so that it becomes the financially rational choice for Maker to allocate collateral to assets that have a public good impact.  Protectors And then there\u2019s SubDAOs - in particular ProtectorDAOs. The idea is that while trying to include public good metrics into capital allocation is far too complex to do at the Maker level, Protectors can be an order of magnitude more flexible and smart, and they should have complete freedom to allocate assets according to whatever values and strategy that they have - but Maker will only consider what kind of risk adjusted return they are providing when it comes to how much collateral Maker allocates to each Protector. In practice though, Proteoctors will probably often find that by considering public good impact they will develop better pipelines with high quality counterparties, and as a result get a better yield for Maker, and maybe it will also attract more value to their tokens, which helps them get more junior capital through the Elixir Wars, and as a result also get a better risk adjusted yield for Maker. Maker Governance, generally can\u2019t influence existing SubDAOs much. But CVC Members have MKR that will likely be in the Sagittarius Engine, and can choose to use their MKR to farm a particular Protector and then through those tokens also try to pursue a public good impact strategy, while then also participating in the charity governance component of the SubDAO. Of course there just need to be clear protections against conflict of interest risk, but this will be the same for all CVC Members, since they will in most cases be farming various SubDAOs, and the solution is just to have very broad and objective frameworks without any political processes for how Maker allocates collateral to the SubDAOs.  Incubation of new SubDAOs The one exception is the incubation of completely new SubDAOs - since nobody can farm the tokens yet, then it is the one place where MKR holders can be quite opinionated and participate in micro management to some extent while also having more sweeping decision making powers. This is through adjusting the DAO-level objectives of the Ecosystem Actor incubation article in the Ecosystem Scope - it would be possible to put a greater emphasis and public good driven marketing and growth strategy services, for instance, to ensure such companies are available for the new SubDAO to tap into.  Growth Scope Then finally there\u2019s the growth scope, where all marketing and growth focused projects will fall under. This is a mixed item, because often a huge part of marketing and branding will be to emphasize all of the public good value creation that Maker does, while also in some cases contributing to more. But of course the main objective has to be growth and economic gain, and there must be strong objective metrics in place to ensure all spend that is considered growth spend actually delivers the intended results - at the same time often we will probably find that activities that might look almost like charity can drive the most impressive growth metrics, or at least be valuable experiments. E.g. it seems like a worthy idea to for instance hand out cheap smart phones preloaded with dai in underdeveloped communities, or other such ideas that look like public good but ultimately are driven by a long term and patient approach to achieving ROI.  4) The Regenerative Finance CVC, like all other CVCs, must cover all scopes and spend energy on all areas of governance Not all aspects of Maker Governance are relevant for regenerative finance or public good value creation, or at least feel directly relevant. An example could be designing the principles related to smart contract security, or related to accounting or KPIs, or other such things. But for a CVC to be active and be shown in the easy governance frontend, and gain delegate followers with incentivized votes, and earn the CVC Member participation reward, it must be able to cover all Scope Frameworks every quarter, or lose its active status. This also makes sense in the context that public good and economic value is inherently linked together in Maker - it is crucial even if you\u2019re just here to improve the world, that Makers smart contracts are safe and that sound accounting practices are used by the ecosystem actors etc. Otherwise the value of the Purpose System and the Clean Money Fund will suffer, there will be less public good created. This \u201cproblem\u201d is also somewhat faced by the Resilience CVC, which has a similar focused approach to what kind of governance it is particular interested in. I think the simplest solution is to just try to take a middle of the road stance to all the other issues, so try to strike a balance between what the Surplus (hawk) position is vs what the Scaling (dove) position is, and then make strong opiniated decisions when things that are directly relevant to the focus area come up. Okay, I have even more thoughts but don\u2019t have more time as I still have other work to do in preparation for the frozen period wednesday, but as I said, I\u2019m super excited about this and am ready to spend a lot of time and energy on supporting it so it can be launched and be fully functional and included in all of the official processes as soon as the the Maker Constitution is ratified.

There is a real risk a big holder joins and unilaterally makes all the decisions, so there is a strong incentive to only invite those they trust.   A solution to this could be that CVCs only allow new members to join with a subset of their MKR. So e.g. the maximum amount of MKR you can have registered is 10 or some other number, so even a whale will be limited in their ability to alter the outcome. This might of course conflict with the desire for getting CVC Member rewards, but in the end from the perspective of the protocol the best measure we have of someones alignment is the amount of MKR they own. It could also be strategically increases as the competition to get the CVC reward increases and the barrier goes up. The other thing is also since CVCs fundamentally are cooperative (as you can always split), then you will just generally assume that the other members are aligned with you. If they werent they dont get much from joining you, they should go and join the CVC they are actually aligned with, the split mechanic ensures that you can\u2019t really \u201ctake over\u201d a CVC.

ACREinvest would play a limited role in helping Team ACRE DAOs learn the MakerDAO ropes and support the kind of flexible experimentation needed to do something this radical. In particular we want to co-sign and confirm our agreement that participation in the full-scope of CVC activities is extremely important. We would not want the values and contributions of \u201cRegenerative Finance\u201d to be viewed as a side-show or placed in an \u201cimpact\u201d ghetto. The best talents and experience across all Scope dimensions can be found among people who want to see this industry reach its full potential. Over the last 18 months we observed that the regenerative economy theme attracts tons of new people to \u201ccrypto\u201d who never had an interest in the space until they heard about its potential to do good. Many of the engineers are building on Cosmos and often ReFi builders have gravitated away from Ethereum to cheaper networks and projects with messaging specifically targeting this group. The last 6 months have provided a serious tailwind for MakerDAO to grab market and mindshare in the movement. People who did not have roots in Bitcoin or any knowledge of the cypherpunk origins of this work piled into \u201cWeb3\u201d in the last bull with little understanding of the fundamentals that drive everything. In many camps there\u2019s an allergy to and admitted ignorance about the \u201cfinance\u201d part of ReFi. We think ACRE DAOs will be a good cultural fit here at MakerDAO as a CVC Member while also serving as bridge for (1) technical people who have shunned Ethereum pre-merge for its energy consumption, (2) TradFi refugees who want to do more with what they know and (3) grassroots types who need us to figure out the DeFi part ,so they can do what they do best in regenerating their local communities and economies.

Many of the engineers are building on Cosmos and often ReFi builders have gravitated away from Ethereum to cheaper networks and projects with messaging specifically targeting this group.   +1 to this really important point: crypto still looms as a mostly blank canvas, with so many different people keen to harness the technology in order to make a positive impact in the real world. I\u2019m optimistic about that untapped potential and think that one of the main strengths of the Endgame is its effort to empower a diverse coalition of builders under the Maker umbrella. To that end, I think this submission from @goodnews and ACRE DAOs is a fantastic development, and it\u2019s not hard to see how a ReFi CVC could develop some serious buy-in and legitimacy. Generating that kind of momentum is useful for the internal functioning of the CVC (by aligning members around a clear and exciting vision) and for Maker more broadly (both by further decentralizing governance, and spurring more ideas about how the protocol can deliver real-world value).

I think it needs a healthy balance because unless CVC is created just for doing governance work to get CVC member rewards, they would need to also attract MKR holders to attract Constitutional Delegates as well. And the max limit to make it equal might actually discourage such large holders from joining. Especially if all CVCs are required to have such. It\u2019s possible to leave such decision up to CVCs so MKR holders can join the ones that fit their ideal CVC. ",
