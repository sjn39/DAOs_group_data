The default view is \u201clatest\u201d \u2013 so whatever topic has last been posted to will show up, which perhaps looks cluttered to you  You can also view by categories: Categories - Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians Also, per category, you can choose whether or not it shows up for you in Latest. The circle in the top right hand corner defaults to \u201cNormal\u201d I believe. You can mute it, get an email for every single new topic and new reply and various things in between. Now that we have tags, the same can be applied to tags. So maybe you want to follow #browserextension everywhere, regardless of category, you can set your notification settings for that tag alone. If anyone else has tips, screenshots, or other ideas on how to tune your Discourse forum experience, please share! ",
