                    "content": " Summary The Maker Basepool is a proposed integration and partnership with Curve. The core part of the proposal is a newly deployed stablecoin liquidity pool including DAI and other minimum risk fiat-backed stablecoins. Only including low risk stablecoins should allow for onboarding the Basepool LP as a collateral asset, which will increase pool TVL and capital efficiency. The Basepool could serve as the pair asset for other stablecoin liquidity pools, similar to the role played by the existing 3pool LP. Maker could also offer collateral support to these metapools, with risk parameters determined on a case by case basis depending on the risk profile of the paired stablecoin. This brings several potential benefits to MakerDAO:  Increased revenue from stablecoin reserves (which are currently idle within PSMs) Improved relationship with Curve community and influence in Curve governance Improved relationships with 3rd party stablecoin issuers who utilize Basepool liquidity  The main drawbacks of pursuing this proposal include commitment of development resources and increased governance overhead. There is also execution risk, as elements of this proposal require coordination with Curve DAO governance (including large 3rd party holders of CRV and CVX). See the full Basepool draft proposal here.  Implementation Process The expected implementation steps to move this proposal forward are:  Deploy Basepool liquidity pool on Curve  This poll will help determine pool composition   Submit MIP6 proposal for Basepool collateral onboarding to MakerDAO Submit Curve DAO vote to enable pairing with Basepool through Curve\u2019s pool factory Implement and onboard Basepool LP vault with modified cropjoin adapter Deploy gauge contract Submit Curve DAO vote to add gauge rewards to Basepool Submit Curve DAO vote to whitelist MakerDAO for CRV locking  Possible alternative strategies to deploy CRV include Aave and Curve LPs   Investigate onboarding Basepool metapools Implement metagovernance mechanism for managing veCRV votes Implement mkrCRV liquid staking wrapper   Basepool Parameters and Composition Initially, we\u2019ll set up the Basepool on Curve similarly to other pools (standardized swap and admin fees and gauge participation), with the option to switch to a lower fee structure in the future contingent on agreement from Curve governance. Maker has an opportunity to decide the composition of the Basepool\u2019s stablecoin reserves. Maker would be the primary capital provider through vaults, so the community\u2019s perspectives on fundamental risks, liquidity, and strategic value can take precedence in deciding pool assets. In addition to DAI, the following assets should be considered for inclusion in the Basepool (up to 4 assets total): USDC USDC is the most widely used onshore fiat stablecoin. Maker already heavily integrates with USDC collateral so the basepool proposal would likely not represent a significant increase in risk exposure. References:  Collateral onboarding proposal: Proposal for Collateral Onboarding of USDC  USDC protocol risk summary: Summary of USDC protocol risk   BUSD BUSD is the second largest US based stablecoin, with wide usage across the Binance CEX and defi ecosystems. It is managed by Paxos, with a similar fundamental risk profile. Maker has not yet integrated BUSD through PSMs but this could be supported relatively quickly if governance supports it. Onboarding the asset into the Basepool would increase Paxos exposure, but BUSD has the strongest liquidity and organic usage of onshore stablecoins beyond USDC so market risks may be lower than other potential stablecoin components. References:  Old MIP6 collateral application: [BUSD] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application - #6 by monkey.irish   USDP USDP is issued by Paxos and is a small cap onshore stablecoin. Maker currently represents 50% or more of USDP in circulation, which is already a relatively high share of assets. However, Paxos also manages the much larger BUSD stablecoin\u2019s reserves which may increase their flexibility to meet redemption requests. Accepting USDP within the Basepool would likely lead to an increase in total exposure, but potentially this could be limited if the pool is funded through outflows from the PSM. While market capitalization is relatively higher than GUSD, there is still some risk of putting stress on Paxos\u2019 creation and redemption capacity due to changes in Basepool usage. References:  MIP6 collateral application: [PAX] - PAX MIP6 collateral application  Risk evaluation: [USDT / PAX] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation  PSM proposal: Create a PAX PSM   GUSD GUSD is a relatively small capitalization onshore stablecoin. It has a strong legal and backing structure and is managed independently from other stablecoin providers, potentially providing diversification and strategic benefits from a greater number of issuers. Incorporating GUSD into the Basepool could help bootstrap GUSD usage within defi, but would also likely significantly increase Maker\u2019s exposure to Gemini and related counterparties. If the Basepool makes up a large share of GUSD total circulation, changes in usage might put stress on Gemini\u2019s creation or redemption capacities. References:  MIP6 collateral application: [GUSD] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application  Risk evaluation: [GUSD] Collateral Onbording Risk Evaluation  PSM proposal: Proposal: GUSD PSM  PSM risk evaluation: [PSM-GUSD-A] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation   Number of Assets Total gas costs required for a metapool swap increase as the number of tokens in the base pool increases. This gives a slight benefit to a smaller 2 or 3 asset pool vs 4 assets within the Basepool, as users will face marginally lower gas costs. As the pool accepts more assets, this also leads to slightly increased credit and default risk, as any single included token losing peg would cause losses on the entire Curve pool. Even though Maker assesses each of the potential stablecoins as low risk, there is a slight risk benefit in maintaining a smaller pool with fewer individual component assets. Greater number of included assets reduces the share of DAI held within the pool. Each DAI minted from a Basepool LP vault will require a certain amount of DAI to be bought back (to deposit into the LP), so a pool composition with more assets should lead to slightly lower total DAI supply as this artificial demand effect will be lower. Finally, there is an argument that a higher number of component stablecoins could benefit pool utility, as users have more choices for fiat stablecoins and on/offramp providers when trading through the pool.  Pool Options Option #1: DAI, USDC This would be the most minimal possible pool implementation, with lower distribution of credit risks as well as somewhat lower swap gas costs. As the most liquid stablecoin within defi, USDC is a relatively safe choice for integration and would see high utilization. On the other hand, using a two token pool would increase USDC\u2019s dominance within the stablecoin space; Maker benefits from more competition between centralized stablecoin issuers and this option could represent a missed opportunity to support alternatives. Option #2: DAI, USDC, BUSD BUSD is not yet integrated through a PSM, which could impact pool stability and may require a somewhat lower ampliciation parameter to maintain stability. Maker could address this by onboarding a BUSD PSM, which should have relatively little impact on risk exposure because BUSD is also issued by Paxos. Fewer tokens reduces the total number of counterparties where Maker is exposed to credit risk, and also improves user gas costs somewhat. Including BUSD could potentially help improve relationships with top exchange Binance, who is heavily invested in BUSD\u2019s success. USDC and BUSD both have high usage, liquidity, and market capitalization, which may provide better utility as compared with options #1 or #3. Option #3: DAI, USDC, USDP, GUSD Maker already integrates each stablecoin through the PSM, so the pool should remain well balanced even with high amplification parameters. USDP and GUSD are both relatively smaller and less liquid than USDC or BUSD which creates substantial liquidity risks. Already, Maker holds over half of issued USDP tokens, and using this pool composition would increase both USDP and GUSD exposure. In a worst case scenario if DAI demand falls suddenly and forces PSMs to unwind, Paxos and Gemini could face stress due to a rush of redemptions. Author\u2019s note: I personally think option #2 offers the best combination of high utility and strategic benefits (including top fiat backed stablecoins and adding support for BUSD) while minimizing liquidity risks that could arise from owning a large share of component stablecoins (as would be the case for GUSD and USDP under option #3).  Basepool Composition Informal Poll The final Basepool composition will incorporate feedback from this poll, but may differ from the results depending on technical implementation concerns and comments from core units, delegates, or Curve community members. Voters are encouraged to select select all options they would be willing to support for integration and collateral onboarding (you can select one or more options). What Basepool composition(s) do you support?     Option #1: DAI, USDC Option #2: DAI, USDC, BUSD Option #3: DAI, USDC, USDP, GUSD Other composition (please comment below) None (do not support Basepool) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This poll will run through the weekend. After incorporating feedback from this poll and the Curve community, the process will move forward with pool deployment and additional actions described above. ",

This would allow Maker to treat this LP token similar to the GUNI-DAI-USDC LP tokens and offer a vault with high leverage (low liquidation ratio). LUSD can be paired in a metapool with the Basepool, and this metapool LP could potentially be onboarded as Maker collateral (with more conservative risk parameters than the Basepool itself to account for higher risk and volatility).
