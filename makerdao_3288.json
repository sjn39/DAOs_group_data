                    "content": "LFW: By @Aaron_Bartsch and @ultraschuppi 's powers combined, here\u2019s an ETH-A DC-IAM gap signal request.  Hi Everyone, With the current DC-IAM configuration on ETH-A we are having gap set to 30MM. Looking at the chart of DAI-from-ETH-A compared to the DC, we can clearly see that we hit the DC a couple of times.  Additionally, the currently running onchain poll for raising ETH-A line looks like we are going to increase it a lot. I guess we need to adjust the gap to keep up with the demand. Another way of solving this issue is lowering the ttl but given the current gasprices, this is not a good option. Pros:  risk of hitting the DC before ttl is done is getting lower we are not artificially slowing down appetite for DAI-from-ETH-A decreasing the potential for griefing attacks  more headroom - if a true bullrun starts, we can satisfy a surge on demand a lot better  Cons:  we are not artificially slowing down appetite for DAI-from-ETH-A higher exposure to OSM timing attacks, but since OSM risks are much lower on ETH-A - probably not a big risk  Should we increase the `gap` of the ETH-A DC IAM? Please choose all options you agree with.     No Change (30M gap) +10M DAI (40M gap) +20M DAI (50M gap) +30M DAI (60M gap) +40M DAI (70M gap) +50M DAI (80M gap) +60M DAI (90M gap) +70M DAI (100M gap) Abstain/Show Results     0 voters     Next Steps If a result other than \u201cNo Change\u201d gains a majority I will create an on-chain poll to vote on March 1st, 2021. This signal request will run until 2021-02-25T05:00:00Z. ",

Plurality is defined as something like: \u201cthe number of votes cast for a candidate who receives more than any other but does not receive an absolute majority.\u201d I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s super worthwhile to run IRV for this. I\u2019m aware this is inconsistent with what we\u2019ve done before, but IRV adds a level of complexity to polls that I don\u2019t really like unless there is a clear value add. Will Maker Holders appreciate having the option between a 70M and 80M gap, or would it be something they just shrug over and rank them arbitrarily? I\u2019m not sure, but I suspect the latter. If people really want (and think it is worthwhile) to have IRV for this then reply and let me know. ",
