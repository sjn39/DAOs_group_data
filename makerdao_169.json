This is a completely ridiculous argument. I personally want ETH to increase in price, but the dynamics are likely to be completely different than BTC. As we move to proof-of-stake, the inflation of ETH will drop a lot, but as scalability solutions are deployed, there will be a lot less organic demand for ETH to pay for gas.

Whether it is a few percentages more or a few weeks later - it doesn\u2019t matter. You cannot argue that some completely different trend will emerge because ETH will be 2.0 instead of 1.0. I understand your argument for less ETH demand in that specific case but too many other variables are unknown. Since there will likely be no really radical crypto improvements in next year or two - the driver for the next bubble will (also) be speculation. There is absolutely no reason not to believe that we will see new ATH for major coins soon. It happened in 2013, 2017 and it will happen again because nothing fundamentally changed in crypto space from 2011 to 2020. Summary of 2011-2020 developments: new developments/advances/services in crypto. Summary of 2011-2020 prices: bubbles and busts but overall growth except for coins which fell into obscurity. Having said all that - I think that unforeseen/unpredictable events can still cause all this industry to fail or become a niche. I\u2019d give that outcome 30% chance. ",
