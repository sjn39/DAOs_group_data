So my suggestion is to boil it down to e.g. \u201cThings we agreed on\u201d, \u201cThings that excited us\u201d and \u201cProblems we have\u201d. I will start for the Wallet-Ring: Things we agreed on:  Our mission shall be from now on \u201cMake wallets more useful, interoperable, user friendly, private, decentralized, safe and accessible.\u201d For scaling reasons we will form sub rings (Mobile, Desktop, Hardware)  Outer rings still exists - just augmented by inner rings for specific discussions around one of this sub-topics    Things that excited us  Storage of private keys WalletConnect Wallet reputation mETHadata  Problems we have  We are infested with some centralisation and need to cure that better sooner than later  Note: we only voted on \u201cThings we agreed on\u201d - for \u201cThings that exited us\u201d and \u201cProblems we had\u201d I basically just took from our notes  Also what I think would be a nice touch: let\u2019s make ceremony that enables each participant of a session to sign the \u201cThings we agreed on\u201d and perhaps even the full protocol of the session.

There are several items from Meta Magicians and EIPs that fit this. Changing / agreeing / renewing the Charter of the Wallet ring is what I see you doing here. And if a Charter is not regularly agreed & renewed. A Ring dissolves. I know we\u2019re barely forming them \u2014 but it should be clear that  energy is required to keep going. Love it.
