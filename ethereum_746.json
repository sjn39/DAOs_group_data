When data is brought on-chain, this also often includes large merkle proofs relating it back to concise on-chain state. Currently the cost of updating storage is ~ 5000 gas. The cost of verifying a single Merkle tree of depth 32 is ~70 000 gas. It is cheaper to skip L2 scaling and just store on chain. Examples of applications that are currently constrained by transaction data cost:  FunFair Rollup StarkDEX DutchX Truebit  Final implementation is a trivial update of costs, but before that we need to extensively research what would be an appropriate gas cost and it\u2019s impact on the network.
