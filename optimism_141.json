L2 Recipient Address: 0x2f593f151aF4bb9A71bcA6cAce1d3c56C2844117  Voting Cycle: Cycle 8  Grant Category: DeFi  Additional team member info Liquity Team Info   Previous/relevant projects: Liquity, Chicken Bonds  Competitor/Peers: None. There are functionally similar protocols involving much trust or permission, like Maker, Spell/MIM or QiDAO.  Optimism Native: No.  Is this project open-sourced: Yes    Relevant Usage Metrics  Number of LUSD on Optimism: 4 M, with 90,758 transfers and 811 holders. On mainnet, Liquity has a 179.7M supply, with 276,810 transfers and 5509 holders.   Ecosystem Value Proposition LUSD has been one of the first stablecoins to come to Optimism, thanks to Synthetix, which used a LUSD wrapper to stabilize sUSD on Optimism that absorbed close to 45M of LUSD on Optimism at some point. Thanks to the launch of Velodrome and the veVELO NFT airdrop Liquity received, several LUSD-related pools have grown to sizeable TVL. Finally, the recently added support for LUSD in Stargate facilitates the fast withdrawal from Optimism to mainnet. While the Liquity protocol is not deployed on Optimism (mainnet only - any rollup deployment would require a full protocol re-deployment & migration), LUSD, the stablecoin outputted by the protocol, has a solid and growing presence on the network. Along with sUSD, LUSD is one of the few stablecoins that is not centralized nor collateralized by centralized and censurable stablecoins. Outside of the mainnet where the Liquity protocol operates, Optimism is currently the only network where LUSD is officially supported. More information about LUSD on Optimism is available here  Proposal for token distribution  How will the OP tokens be distributed? The OP tokens will be used to grow and sustain LUSD\u2019s foothold on Optimism. They will help to attract attention and assets to new integrations and support their growth until a critical mass is reached:   Liquidity bribes [70%] on Velodrome to grow LUSD-related pools, focusing on the unstoppable LUSD/ETH (350k OP/year).  Borrow incentives [20%] (Once live) potentially \u2013 borrower incentives for LUSD on Aave/Optimism (100k OP/year)  Community/Ecosystem Grants [10%]: OP tokens will be distributed as grants to users and developers, building tools and partnerships to help the protocol grow its presence on Optimism. The grants will be paid out directly in OP. (50k OP)   How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Optimism direly needs credible stablecoins that are not subject to censorship. Indeed, Liquity is a top-tier Ethereum protocol and still the only protocol offering a stablecoin 100% powered by immutable smart contracts. We believe that growing LUSD liquidity on the network is a net positive by itself, not only for Liquity but also for Optimism, as it diversifies the stablecoin offering and offers a credible hedge if regulation-related issues were to arise on a major centralized stablecoin.  image1809\u00d7678 113 KB  LUSD is already available in diverse pairing against other main stablecoins. >$5M of LUSD liquidity has been grown and maintained over the last six months without any grants. If obtained, the OP grants will help tremendously to keep growing LUSD\u2019s presence on the network, especially the LUSD/ETH pool.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? The low transaction fees on Optimism attract users who are concerned about the resilience of their stablecoin but not able to afford mainnet fees on L1 \u2014 LUSD on Optimism presents a credible offering to such profiles, currently filled by no other stablecoins. Before the incentives (currently), Liquity is already maintaining ~5M of LUSD-related liquidity on Optimism. We\u2019re confident a year-long incentivization on a reasonable budget, as suggested, will push this baseline further.  Over what period will the tokens be distributed? The current proposed budget is tailored for yearly usage.  Has your project previously received an OP token grant? If yes, what\u2019s the status of these tokens? Despite being the top stablecoin on Optimism supply-wise at the OP launch (~50M LUSD on Optimism then), Liquity has not received any OP grants. Moreover, LUSD was decisive in helping sUSD maintain its peg and reach the massive adoption it\u2019s currently seeing on Optimism: Liquity  Optimism.  How much will your project match in co-incentives? Liquity has been a supportive actor of the Optimism ecosystem since the Velodrome launch. However, the team usage of incentives is minimal: even on mainnet. Instead, we\u2019d rather support the ecosystem through other means, like our active role in documenting Liquity\u2019s successful usage of Velodrome. To facilitate the tracking and reporting on the 500K OP requested, a separate and dedicated Safe has been deployed: 0x2f593f151aF4bb9A71bcA6cAce1d3c56C2844117 Proposal Last updated Dec 07 - updated notes ",

Would you mind clarifying which one is not a sanctioned use of the OP allocation?  2/ Grants for projects building on top of Optimism/LUSD Indeed, we\u2019re talking here about integrations similar to what Synthetix did. To give you a more concrete example, we\u2019ve been chatting with the CompliFi team lately who is considering launching an instance of their product (derivatives) on Optimism using LUSD as the base currency. That would be a prime target to receive such a grants. Regarding the allocation decision, since Liquity has no governance nor DAO it will be the responsibility of the team indeed. Just like with our community grants though, we\u2019ll make sure to establish clear guidelines on this front and provide transparency & reasoning for each decision. We\u2019ll also implement a retroactive, result-based approach instead of a \u201cpre-funding\u201d of projects based on their intent. If needs to be, additional details regarding the grants allocation framework can be included in the proposal. ",

Would you mind sharing some context (links?) regarding why providing incentives to people supplying liquidity on bridges is not a sanctioned use? We could drop this part and re-allocate it if needed. Yet it was quite useful, as withdrawing LUSD from Optimism to mainnet takes a week with the official bridge. Offering a faster option makes users more comfortable with the idea of bridging their LUSD from mainnet to Optimism, to begin with. This is exactly what the cBridge enables, yet, the liquidity is quite unbalanced since users tend to do mainnet>Optimism with the official bridge and Optimism>mainnet with the cBridge: we end up with the bridge liquidity almost always heavily unbalanced to the Optimism side (as the mainnet LUSD are usually drained as soon as available).

A lot of stablecoins like DAI,LUSD, etc are only minted on ETH mainnet and also need to be used for liquidations on mainnet. When a lot of that liquidity gets bottled up on L2, it creates a liquidity crunch on L1 (since L2<>L1 withdrawals take 7days) which becomes amplified at times of volatility when there are a some large liquidations that need to occur but liquidity is thin. Having reliable bridge liquidity would increase the confidence of whales to bridge their LUSD over to Optimism long term, also it would stimulate volume and transaction activity from arbitrage flow between L1 and OP.

Edit ~2h later: so yes indeed the cBridge can handle LM campaigns for LP on one side only. So LM only for users providing LUSD on the Ethereum side seems preferable, as it would help to solve the current unbalance issue. ",

I understand, sadly the Liquity treasury is more limited than Optimism\u2019s. I\u2019ll still ask around and see if we can allocate some LQTY. Yet, even though Liquity is not contributing assets directly, Liquity has been decisive to Optimism\u2019s success, as LUSD was the top stablecoin on Optimism for a while (before the OP token) and contributed to help stabilize sUSD on the network.

If a significant portion of the LUSD supply is on L2 and there is a period of sharp price volatility for ETH, liquidators may not be able to fully liquidate troves on L1 and the whole protocol would be at risk. For context Synthetix had integrated an LUSD wrapper on Optimism for many months but had to eventually shut it down due to risk of cornering too much of the supply on L2 without  fast bridging relief and risking the the possibility of Troves becoming under collateralized in a black swan event (or even just a market wide nuke like we saw in May and June). cc @lefterisjp ",

                    "content": "Hello @millie and @mm3729_PrimeRating, great questions! I\u2019ll answer them in order.     millie:  If a significant portion of the LUSD supply is on L2 and there is a period of sharp price volatility for ETH, liquidators may not be able to fully liquidate troves on L1 and the whole protocol would be at risk.   This is a valid concern the team is not overlooking and partly why this proposal focuses a sizeable share of the OP budget on providing incentives for users providing LUSD liquidity to the mainnet bridge. We\u2019re discussing with Hop protocol to examine how their solution might prove more efficient at ensuring balanced liquidity on both sides of the bridge at all times, although it comes with additional requirements. Finally, we\u2019ve also slightly revised the budget to allocate more for the bridging incentives to ensure we have sufficient firepower if needed.     mm3729_PrimeRating:  Thanks for the proposal @TokenBrice. Last time we reviewed Liquity , there was a huge 63.7% of the LQTY token reserved for team + insiders (reference from Liquity Medium article here) which raises concerns of centralization. Also increases risk of insiders making a nice buck when the lock-ups end. How do you see this?   Since LQTY doesn\u2019t have any governance capability, this is a non-issue, and there cannot be any centralization concerns stemming from this observation. I might also remind you that many of the protocols pleading for OP grants have a token with governance capability and similar ownership distribution, with a few actors able to be decisive in governance proposals. And to be sure we\u2019re clear: this is not the case with Liquity since there is no governance. The LQTY allocated to investors already unlocked last April, without any significant impact on LQTY\u2019s price nor massive sell-off, demonstrating strong confidence of the investors that are not looking for a quick buck. Meanwhile, the LQTY allocated to the team is under a 4 year vesting period, with no funds unlocked during the first year - meaning that team-owned LQTY barely started to unlock and won\u2019t be fully liquid until 3 more years. Thus, a large share of the LQTY circulating today is made of the Community Allocation (mostly distributed to Stability Pool depositors), which was quite generous initially and progressively decreases. I hope this post addresses your concerns, let me know if that is not the case. ",
