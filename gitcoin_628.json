First to address the point you raised, which I don\u2019t find any useful to go in, but let\u2019s entertain:     owocki:  The grant had 13 references to the word \u201cIran\u201d in it,   Here\u2019s the grant page in question, AFAIK nothing was changed in the text except the Update on top regarding Giveth and DGrants update. Title: Free Smart Contract Development Course for Farsi Speaking Communities I see 8 mention of the word \u201cIran\u201d:  website: https:// smartcontract . coiniran . com This opportunity, organized by the non-profit educational organization \u201cCoinIran\u201d\u2019s founder Bahar  Women in Blockchain\u2019s Founder Thessy Mehrain (also \u00bd Iranian), was designed to teach all the fundamentals of smart contract development. This indeed was huge for us. Participating in an international course, coming from Iran, enabled us to overcome \u2026 \u2026 some of the everyday challenges imposed on Iranian society. The Farsi-speaking community has a population of more than 120 million, located in West Asia in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Iran. Moreover, heavy sanctions imposed on Iranian citizens has limited them from accessing most social media platforms via geoblocking and even blocking educational platforms, in this way making it difficult to gain access to accurate and up to date education content. In this year\u2019s ConsenSys Academy Ethereum developer bootcamp, we were able to sponsor 65 Farsi speaking individuals (45 from Iran and 20 from Afghanistan).   And regarding the second part:     owocki:  implied heavily that funds would be sent to sanctioned nations.   Here\u2019s the line regarding compensation from the grant page:  Please support us in our mission! Not only will your funds help ensure that our volunteers get fairly compensated for the hard labour they put into managing and maintaining this course, but it will also help ensure that the course content and materials stay accessible and free to everyone! Let\u2019s build a more equitable future by ensuring that everyone - regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, and geographical location - can benefit from blockchain.  This was speculated that the volunteers are in \u201csanctioned nations\u201d. The volunteers are a combination of known actors living in countries such as Canada, Netherland, Armenia, and Afghanistan.  The issue is not with the grant\u2019s nitty gritty details, but more so how this was handled by Gitcoin and what the ecosystem learned from it (and took away from it). Now my question from anyone reading this, how can a constructive dialogue be established to deal with this sensitive matter?

Now my question from anyone reading this, how can a constructive dialogue be established to deal with this sensitive matter?  First, you can please stop spreading misinformation that Farsi language grants are not allowed on the platform.  (they are).   Grants that create legal risk for the Gitcoin community by implying they send money to sanctioned nations (or actually sending funds) are not. Grants that break the law are not. From there,  if there is a grant that has attained an exception to the sanctions, they can email proof of this fact to legal@gitcoin.co  if you believe that the law is unfair or unjust, you can lobby the government (who is coercing Gitcoin to not host the grant) to change the law.   Here\u2019s the grant page in question, AFAIK nothing was changed in the text except the Update on top regarding Giveth and DGrants update.  I have in my notes that there were 13 references to Iran back at the time this grant was disabled. Perhaps the grant has been edited by its author since it was first posted - I do not have the cycles today to restore a DB backup to find out if it has or not. Regardless of whether there was 8 references to Iran or 13, the Grant\u2019s implied support for those in sanctioned nations creates legal risk for Gitcoin\u2019s community as interpreted by Gitcoin\u2019s General Counsel.  We\u2019ve invited the community a number of times to email legal@gitcoin.co if they have attained an exception to sanctions and have not yet received an inquiry that meets the threshold set by our legal counsel. I can appreciate & understand the community\u2019s frustration that our legal counsel\u2019s guidance about EXACTLY where the line is is not clear.  Our legal counsel is also operating in an environment in which the letter of the law does not explicitly spell out EXACTLY where the line is, so I hope the community can understand & appreciate the constraints that our legal counsel is operating under.  The issue is not with the grant\u2019s nitty gritty details,  Maybe it\u2019s not an issue for you, but it is for people who bare legal risk because of a grant\u2019s nitty gritty details. The US government has already shown they are more than willing to jail those web3 enthusiasts who violate sanctions. ",

In fact the language would need to reflect that it is specifically for the Farsi speaking community outside of Iran.  A good example of this is the crypto news website CoinIran - part of their mission is:   Providing specialized personnel in the field of blockchains and cryptocurrencies   Providing advice and support to Iranian projects and start-ups in the field of blockchain   This clear language is a smoking gun that prevents people in the western world from supporting or participating.  I didn\u2019t dive anymore deeply into the other founders and creators of the grant. In order to have any chance of making this dream a reality - there has to be careful consideration put into protecting the Gitcoin community and platform.  That means taking measurable tangible steps to distance yourself from any organization or people who are interested in Blockchain to circumnavigate the sanctions against Iran, Iranian nationals or organizations, or other individuals or groups that express a desire to teach blockchain technology to people in Iran.

WASHINGTON \u2013 Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued Iran General License (GL) D-2 to increase support for internet freedom in Iran by bringing U.S. sanctions guidance in line with the changes in modern technology since the issuance of Iran...      A few authorized transactions based on GL D-2 article:  (1) Fee-based or no-cost services. The exportation or reexportation, directly or indirectly, from the United States or by a U.S. person, wherever located, to Iran of fee-based or no-cost services incident to the exchange of communications over the Internet, such as instant messaging, chat and email, social networking, sharing of photos and movies, web browsing, blogging, social media platforms, collaboration platforms, video conferencing, e-gaming, e-learning platforms, automated translation, web maps, and user authentication services, as well as cloud-based services in support of the foregoing or of any other transaction authorized or exempt under the ITSR.

Specially the fact that the suspended users here are Iranian women working on educational material that can save millions of people from oppression. We should do better than web2 not worst.   For context: Last week Iran\u2019s \u201cmorality police\u201d which is responsible for keeping people out of post-death hell by forcing them to follow islamic methods, such as covering hair and body for women (hijab), brutally murdered a girl named Mahsa Amini. This is not the first time but it became public and pushed people past their tolerance level. They came to streets to show their anger about the police/government brutality and demanded freedom from oppression. The street protests were answered by nationwide internet shutdowns and mass arrests and killings. These are ongoing events and it\u2019s escalating quickly. Note that Twitter, Facebook, Instagram has been filtered by Iranian government and many other tools such as Github, Slack, and Google Cloud services has been geoblocking Iranian IPs due to sanctions. It seems that Meta is also removing the related content from Facebook and Instagram due to their ToS!! One of the international outcomes of these global protests has been the distinction of people of Iran from Iran\u2019s government regarding sanctions which is massive imo. US treasury amended their ruling for \u201cInternet Freedom for Iranians\u201d and opening up communication technology to prevent further oppression.  Google acknowledged this for the first time and is looking openning up their services to Iranian, already added a Farsi homepage with  links to download secure VPN  Github which previously worked with OFAC to enable their free services for Iranians, publicly defended Iranian developers\u2019 rights (blog post) Most of the Canadian telecom companies are waving all the long distance fees for callings to Iran.  It saddens me that I have not seen any (even vocal) support from any of the web3/crypto companies. ",

This will be on the protocol. What does this mean? The protocol is a decentralized backend and set of smart contracts which can run a grants round end to end. Ideally, even if Gitcoin did not allow a grant, another org could fork the protocol, UI, and community. In reality, the beta and alpha launches will still run the final calculations of a round in a centralized way. Additionally, the ability to censor grants, while not possible on the protocol, is an option on the UI. Therefore, Gitcoin and any other org hosting a UI, will be responsible for making the decision as to how much liability they own via control AND the limits of how much potential liability they are willing to accept. Seeing how the next round won\u2019t be until January, and the protocol transition work is mid-flight, I don\u2019t think we will be able to answer this until more pieces of the protocol are set. I\u2019ll also tag @kyle @kevin.olsen and @nategosselin to the conversation. ",
