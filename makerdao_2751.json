DAI price seems to be more or less fixed around $1.01, but we shouldn\u2019t underestimate new DAI demand from upcoming farms in the next few weeks. We learnt the lesson with SAFE when more than 170m DAI was drained out of liquidity venues in only a few days. We would also want to have an additional stablecoin debt ceiling buffer always ready that provides liquidity in an event of unwinding ETH and WBTC vaults due to an unexpected crash in crypto markets. Question is by how much and if we want to increase the debt ceiling on stablecoins and how do we diversify stablecoin exposure. I also want to note that the community already voted to increase the PAX debt ceiling by at least 30m to 60m. There were some concerns on PAX DeFi liquidity and circulating supply, addressed by me here, therefore I suggest we increase it by only 30m at this stage.     No increase of stablecoin DC Increase stablecoin DC by 100m Increase stablecoin DC by 200m Increase stablecoin DC by 300m Abstain     0 voters         No Increase of stablecoin DC Increase DC across USDC and TUSD by equal amounts, and limit PAX increase by 30m Increase DC for TUSD, and limit PAX increase by 30m Other - comment below Abstain     0 voters     The Signal poll closes this Thursday and will proceed to Executive vote this Friday, 25th September.

I guess if I had to make a vote and I may alter mine is to up the cap another 100M and spread it around according to current usage.  I think PAX needed a bump and USDC-A still cranking up. I want to re-iterate something I said on the call here.  While everyone seems confident that we can eat up stablecoins to encourage growth in their ecosystems there is no guarantee this all will make it to Maker.  I am not entirely sure we want to have DCs that approach 100% or greater of any stablecoin as this may introduce some risks and hazards we are unaware of. I do want to add here that it is my own impression that we always want to have DC room. Why I advocated having multple LR tiered DC levels in another poll/post     [Signal Poll] Use multiple stablecoin (e.g. USDC) vaults with different LR/DC combinations to manage value/price/risk exposure Governance       Currently Maker governance is considering changing the USDC-A parameters.  Currently recently changed USDC-A parameters:  Collateralization Ratio: 103 (lowered just a day ago from 110) soon to 101  Debt Ceiling: 200M (raised from 100M just a day ago from 100M)  Risk Premium: 2%  The goal of this signal request is to modify how Maker is extending Debt Ceilings against Liquidation Ratios on not just USDC but all of the stablecoins.  I use USDC here just to give a flavor of what this proposal is su\u2026     A wiser move would be to allow the USDC and other DCs to be hit mostly to ascertain a signal from markets through the PEG what would happen if we didn\u2019t keep expanding DAI liquidity here.  We are now 800M DAI and growing at some point we need to gather information from these markets and doing a pause on expanding the DC is one way to do that.   We can be ready with the next tranch of DC increases in short order if we see a strong reaction upward in the PEG. ",

When I look on Dai stats on the USDT-A usage, it\u2019s basically zero (7K vs 10M DC). In that case the risk parameters for that new vault are so unfavorable (whether the LR or the Interest rate or both, I\u2019m not sure) versus other options in the market no one is using it, so that collateral type is not helping the peg. I understand that the community has justified concerns about USDT risk but if a collateral type isn\u2019t serving DAI stability then perhaps it deserves some fine tuning of the parameters. ",
