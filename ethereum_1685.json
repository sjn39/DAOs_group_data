With the new account type, users will be able to transfer/receive tokens using the name-derived address directly instead of the address of the name owner. A NOA can be as a social identity with all states on-chain even under 3rd-party or self custody. It also simplifies porting the social identity from one custody to another.   github.com/ethereum/EIPs         Create eip-4972.md   ethereum:master \u2190 qizhou:qizhou-noa            opened 06:35PM - 04 Apr 22 UTC               qizhou             +149 -0       When opening a pull request to submit a new EIP, please use the suggested templa\u2026te: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-template.md  We have a GitHub bot that automatically merges some PRs.

One scenario is when a user wants to transfer all the assets from the platform-custodian operator to the self-custodian operator by sending an operator-transfer-request on the platform.  As a result, the platform will change the operator upon the user\u2019s request and pay the gas fee to update the operator. (Note that the platform may charge the user\u2019s gas fee as CEX does) Another scenario is when the NOA is self-custodied and the user wants to sell the assets to a platform. by batch-transferring the assets owned by the NOA to the platform\u2019s operator.  This can be done by sending a tx of changing operator at the cost of the user. Hope this could explain your question.  Please let us know if you have further questions! ",
