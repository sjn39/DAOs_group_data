                    "content": "Overview In the spirit of @LongForWisdom\u2019s thorough Endgame Commentary, we wanted to publicly clarify our thinking surrounding the overall strategic direction for MakerDAO, and the Endgame Plan\u2019s role in it going forward. As many others have pointed out, the Endgame Plan contains a number of innovative ideas, but the proposals are complex and involve interlocking concepts that will dramatically change MakerDAO moving forward. We deeply appreciate all of @Rune\u2019s efforts to this point, and in response, wanted to lay out an alternative mental framework for the community before voting has ended on the Endgame MIPs. The Endgame Plan is addressing the need, in part based on regulatory and legal uncertainties specifically surrounding stablecoin projects, for (a) an optimal organizational design, (b) long-term growth strategy, and (c) framework to incentivize innovation and vibrancy within the MakerDAO ecosystem. We believe these debates all funnel into one fundamental question: How can we increase MakerDAO\u2019s decentralization while best optimizing long-term growth? Given that DAI\u2019s most valuable characteristic is its decentralization, we believe that putting MakerDAO on a long-term path to legal, technical, and economic decentralization through the workforce (legal), the customer (technical), and the product (economic) will provide a strategic direction that can help frame other operational decisions by the community. In this vein, another core question is whether MakerDAO should be viewed as a decentralized repository that uses DAI as a bridge asset to access its lower cost of capital, or an immutable decentralized currency in itself. In other words, should the long-term focus be on growth, resiliency, or a coordinated mix of both? The community\u2019s answer to this question will drive different paths to legal, technical, and economic decentralization, resulting in separate analysis for each part of the Endgame Plan. It also has follow-on implications for floating DAI off the $1 hard-peg (which is only enabled by the PSM). Growth prioritizes a $1 hard-peg for predictability for external markets. Alternatively, prioritizing resiliency insinuates a move to the originally intended \u201csoft-peg\u201d for DAI by removing, or at least limiting, the amount of centralized stablecoins held on MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet through the PSM. Decentralization (a) Legal: MakerDAO Core Units Legal decentralization requires reducing the possibility of potential information asymmetries while eliminating any ongoing reliance from stakeholders involving critical \u201cmanagerial efforts\u201d of others. The Core Unit structure is arguably already legally decentralized; many are individually wrapped in their own LLC and none are directed by the managerial efforts of others. The possibility for information asymmetries is also dramatically reduced through MakerDAO\u2019s open governance process. Introducing MetaDAOs likely does not change this analysis, nor lead to more organizational resiliency from a strictly legal perspective. Per @LongForWisdom\u2019s comments, we agree that it is very difficult to bootstrap live communities, and that the political, organizational, and economic effects of doing so are complicated. If we want to change how the Core Units are functioning to improve their performance, however, then we should use specific procedures to alter their behavior. In other words, do we need to externally restructure how Core Units work, per the Endgame Plan, or implement community-driven internal changes to improve accountability, efficiency, and output? @Juan\u2019s Project-based budgeting is a great example of a ready-to-implement solution that could be used to increase the performance of the Core Units without introducing the organizational risk inherent in radically redesigning the foundation of MakerDAO\u2019s full time contributor base. (b) Technical: Minting DAI MakerDAO\u2019s open-source smart contract protocol is also already decentralized from a technical lens. However, technical decentralization could be increased if more clients were deployed, perhaps by governance incentivizing greater use cases for DAI across the DeFi ecosystem. @psychonaut\u2019s recent post on the topic echoes this sentiment. For MakerDAO, more technical decentralization practically means \u201cwho can enable users access to DAI after depositing collateral?\u201d Or, \u201chow can we incentivize as many access points to DAI generation as possible?\u201d Currently, there are such frontends, however incentivizing more could lead to more resilient technical decentralization. This dovetails with the Endgame Plan\u2019s desire to innovate and expand how others can build on top of MakerDAO. The tension with this approach lies in the importance of governance retaining ultimate authority in underwriting the collateral that backs DAI; every $1 of DAI outstanding needs to have at least $1 of external collateral backing it within MakerDAO\u2019s smart contracts. So while many different frontends can conceivably access MakerDAO\u2019s smart contracts, there could become a commoditization effect to what each offers \u2014 access to DAI. Like many other DeFi protocols, it\u2019s illogical to allow any frontend to determine its own rules for generating DAI, as doing so would result in a race to the bottom, where frontends would accept the riskiest collateral to mint DAI. So full technical decentralization through a variety of frontends should be incentivized to the extent possible while recognizing that decentralizing DAI\u2019s backing (more below) is the crux of the issue. Incentivization of frontends could be achieved by providing commissions on the amount of DAI minted through such frontends, similar to how Liquity.org works. Ideally, such incentivization schemes would be sufficient to cause developers to develop frontends that also offer utility for the deployment of DAI, such as through Yearn-like trustless strategies. (c) Economic: What backs DAI? Economic decentralization entails holding collateral that cannot be seized, frozen, or otherwise made unreachable. The debates involving MakerDAO\u2019s USDC exposure and real-world asset program are directly related to this question. This is fundamentally about risk allocation. Collateral sits on a spectrum of decentralization, and centralized collateral has inherent risks because it can be frozen or blacklisted by another party. If MakerDAO issues 1B DAI against collateral that is subsequently blacklisted, the system is now insolvent, which is an existential risk to the long-term continuity of the project. Below are three possible ways to address this concern, which somewhat map to Rune\u2019s Phoenix, Eagle, and Pigeon stances. (1) Beginning immediately, only accept \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d collateral types, such as Ethereum and certain derivative products. (2) Continue to accept a certain amount of collateral types with centralization risks (USDC, wBTC, etc.), and decrease their usage over time. (3) Embrace that MakerDAO will have to accept some centralized collateral and put caps on it. Over time, any collateral that meets this criteria would have to be accordingly backed by the same amount of DAI in the Surplus Buffer. As Rune points out in his post on free-floating DAI, economic decentralization (the percentage of DAI backing that cannot be frozen, blacklisted, or seized) is difficult to accomplish without accepting a soft peg; incorporating a hard 1:1 exchange module with centralized stablecoins is one of the few tools that has successfully kept a hard peg throughout volatile market conditions. If MakerDAO seeks to fully decentralize on an economic basis, we agree with Rune\u2019s analysis regarding the need for a predictable timeline. We would add that beginning immediately, any centralized collateral (USDC, RWA, etc.) should be proportionally backed by the Surplus Buffer at a programmatic level (for example, 5%). If a certain collateral type doesn\u2019t meet this threshold by a community-determined deadline, a hard cap could be established that offboards the collateral until the system is in balance. Over time, this percentage could increase until 100% of centralized collateral (or an agreed-upon percentage by the community) on MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet is backed by Surplus Buffer funds. In Conclusion The Endgame Plan incorporates different innovations designed to drive MakerDAO forward; we will deliberately evaluate each piece separately through the lenses proposed above. We will support MIPs that we believe will contribute to the decentralization of the protocol. We will vote against MIPs that do not meet this threshold in their current form. We also support experimentation through smaller, self-contained proposals to get a baseline for how proposed changes might work (or not) in practice. The community can then iterate on these smaller proposals before implementing wholesale changes that affect the entire system. As always we are available here on the forums, or on Twitter @_portersmith and @milesjennings for further thoughts. Best, Porter and Miles ",

These tightly integrated \u201centities\u201d and their monocultures make any DAO vulnerable to unconventional competitors and blind to new kinds of opportunities (see what happened w/RFW CU, some say getting a budget is the only motivation for CUs to exist). As David Weinberger explained it in his book \u201csmall pieces loosely joined\u201d, similar to how the web is diverse, but yet coherent\u2014the Endgame will create an organizational model that mimics the architecture of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations\u2014and MetaDAOs will be free to form and evolve via the \u201cprimary scopes\u201d and \u201csupporting scopes\u201d and they will all share the same approach to target setting, internal contracting, and \u201ccross-unit\u201dcoordination. I can also tell you that after attending the DAOist in Bogota, Colombia\u2014the ecosystem of DAOs (9000++ and counting) that I encountered at this conference is already thinking about how to further decentralize via \u201csub-DAOs\u201d of a DAO. These communities understand that bureaucracies are insular, tied-down in a closed system that doesn\u2019t adapt\u2014it atrophies. And how do we disrupt organizational structures that are bureaucratic\u2014by going from monolithic businesses to MetaDAOs that build their own ecosystems. And I don\u2019t have the right answers, but this is how I\u2019m thinking about it. Surely but slowly, I believe communities will emerge.

                    "content": "Thanks for this post, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re actively engaging in governance and I think the questions and ideas being raised here can also be very helpful in highlighting the context behind the Endgame design. Overall I would argue this post presents/reaffirms what I call the classic \u201cwe\u2019ll take it as it comes\u201d approach to decentralized governance. Basically, the idea is to have MKR continuously grow and evolve the protocol by approving or rejecting ad hoc proposals and pieces of complexity, and it is well symbolized by the quote:     Porter_Smith:  How can we increase MakerDAO\u2019s decentralization while best optimizing long-term growth?   That is, a continuous process where MKR holders keep evolving the direction and the scope of the protocol by continuously inviting proposals that answer the open question above. This supports an infinite evolution of the Maker Protocol over time and means that there is no limit to the level of technical or political complexity that Maker will obtain. I also call this an open-ended implicit complexity paradigm, and unfortunately I consider it to be entirely unviable because of the nature of the complexity spiral it creates. Since the main allure of this approach is that it is \u201csimple\u201d, it favors implicit complexity over explicit complexity. As more \u201csimple\u201d solutions are added without explicit definitions for how they interact with each other, the system grows increasingly complex and opaque. As a result, it becomes even easier to add more implicit complexity, and those who already have momentum in adding and operating the existing implicit complexity are at a major advantage when it comes to adding more of it. This leads to some problematic and contradictory incentives over time. The Endgame Plan tries to fundamentally deal with this problem starting at the root, which is voter apathy and structural inertia. One way to try to illustrate the difference of approach is that the Endgame Plan attempts to answer the question:  How can we construct an immutable incentive framework for a self-organizing governance equilibrium that reliably acts to increase MakerDAO\u2019s decentralization(resilience) while best optimizing long-term growth?  On the surface this question seems more complicated than the one above, but the major difference is that you have to answer it only once (in practice you can\u2019t get it exactly right the first time, and likely must fine tune it slightly over a few iterations). The other advantage is time, we can answer this question today, when there is still a greater probability that most actors involved in Maker are trustworthy and committed to the ideals of the project rather than their own benefit. If we do it right, we can almost entirely eliminate the possibility of infinite complexity growth regardless of how far we extrapolate into the future. When thinking about how to answer this question, the place to start is to first consider how to decisively deal with voter apathy, and holistically build all other elements as an extension of that. Considering individual pieces of complexity in isolation without directly connecting them to the critical, holistic question of voter apathy/voter incentivization, and explicitly defining how they connect to all other elements of complexity is taking a step in the wrong direction, as it becomes yet another element that adds implicit complexity which helps reinforce the complexity spiral.

Underwriting RWAs is a key challenge for Maker at both the centralized and decentralized level and will likely continue to be its Achilles Heel. Maker\u2019s ultimate underwriting decision process currently relies on voting by MKR holders and delegates.  Both of these groups (at least to date) lack adequate underwriting skills/experience to make reasonable RWA underwriting decisions.  There are some notable exceptions here, but they are a relatively small minority. Will the same group of MKR holders and delegates be able to structure and oversee RWA metaDAOs that perform reasonable RWA underwriting? Given these folks weakness in RWA underwriting, it is certainly doubtful and this key area will likely remain an achilles heel for Maker. The best course of action for Maker, in my view, is investing in only the highest quality short duration assets such as US treasuries, where there is almost no credit, interest rate or liquidity risk.  This plays more to Maker\u2019s strengths and avoids one of its biggest (and a very dangerous) weaknesses. ",

Also, as far as I can tell, mDAOs would have a debt ceiling (250M for RWA mDAOs) which is reviewed quarterly based on the framework criteria, so they need to operate during that time with limited deployment of capital up to their debt ceiling. Not sure this is a solution to the problem you raise. I do see that frameworks and the quarterly review of debt ceiling would imply scaling facilities is done progressively. ",

We would add that beginning immediately, any centralized collateral (USDC, RWA, etc.) should be proportionally backed by the Surplus Buffer at a programmatic level (for example, 5%). If a certain collateral type doesn\u2019t meet this threshold by a community-determined deadline, a hard cap could be established that offboards the collateral until the system is in balance. Over time, this percentage could increase until 100% of centralized collateral (or an agreed-upon percentage by the community) on MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet is backed by Surplus Buffer funds.   After reading this is quite a serious statement that could, I guess, be expanded so people understand clearly where you stand. The 5% SB for any centralized asset would limit DAI issuance to 2.7B, i.e. lead to a 50% reduction which would increase the price of DAI until people are willing to sell and use another stablecoin. Difficult to predict, but that would make a significant loss for MakerDAO. The 100% SB goal makes, by construction, centralized assets unable to create any DAI. They become therefore irrelevant in regard to DAI. $-denominated decentralized assets (ETH-backed loans) in DeFi are what? $2-3B? Maybe a few more if we count CeFi conversion to DeFi? If that\u2019s the size of our market, what would be the impact on the economic value of MKR? On the other hand, eurodollars is a >$13,000B market, stablecoins are >$100B market. It feels to me that this passage makes quite a strong statement for implications aren\u2019t easy to understand. ",

Keep a large amount of collateral in fully liquid stablecoins Keep most of the assets in low duration and very safe assets such as short term government bonds, 3) A smaller amount of collateral can also be put in illiquid, high yield and high impact assets (flagship collateral) as long as there is adequate junior capital and proper review by legal and credit experts or consultants, to ensure alignment of interest and proper risk management.  There seems to be the misconception that Protectors would replace these best practices and just do whatever they want, but the opposite is true, the Protectors would be a way to simplify the implementation of these rules for Maker Core, allowing Maker to just spell out the big picture framework and then retroactively modify debt ceilings to the Protector based on the results shown on the ground without having to get in the weeds and micromanage. Abuse of the capital provided to the Protectors can also be directly vetoed by MKR holders at the Maker Core level. The junior capital of the the Protectors would act as an additional buffer, on top of the junior capital that\u2019s already required for Flagship RWA, and that arrangers are already required to bring to the table. While the junior capital at the arranger level is about aligning the interest of the arranger and securing all the real world legal structures, the junior capital at the protector level is about aligning the interest of the MetaDAO governance participants and the deal teams that get rewarded in MetaDAO tokens and thus have direct exposure to the quality of their advice (something that isn\u2019t true in the way RWA is done today) Longer term, the Protector junior capital can also help protect against the risk of physical threats to RWA collateral, since Protectors can only use fully decentralized assets such as staked ETH or Elixir as junior capital. This will of course only happen after years of successful income generation helps build up the reserves of the Protectors. The Phoenix Staking mechanism, similar to the old junior capital module proposed at the beginning of this year but based on ETH, will be a mechanism to attract ETH depositors to take first loss exposure alongside the MetaDAOs own junior capital, will also help decrease the potential worst case scenario losses from a physical attack.

                    "content": "So all MetaDAOs in the long run start with some incubation elixir provided by Maker, likely in the range of 5000 MKR worth each, with more if the frequency is lower than one incubation per year. The launch MetaDAOs, however, don\u2019t receive. The launch Creators start with basically no junior capital at all, just enough dai in their surplus buffers (donated from the Maker surplus buffer) to boostrap and provide job security for their teams. Right now the plan is that the Protectors will be an exception, and will receive a one time donation of 5 million Dai each from the Maker surplus buffer + the other necessary assets for funding their teams and providing job security. This would then give some starting junior capital, though at the same time it wouldn\u2019t change anything from the perspective of Maker since the junior capital is just being shuffled around (the main upside is that there is more clear skin in the game /aligned incentives when it comes to avoiding small disasters or turning large disasters into small disasters) In addition to this starting capital, the MetaDAOs will obviously increase their junior capital through their various income streams, but they will also have specific tokenomics both temporary and permanent that increase their capital base. The first is the treasury bootstrap mechanism It is 200 million MetaDAO tokens for each MetaDAO that are algorithmically sold for Dai over the first two years. This mechanism is mainly in place to fund workforce expenses and provide job security for the launch team of a new MetaDAO as they learn the ropes and have a chance to get to profitability. It\u2019s described here in the endgame plan complete overview: MetaDAO treasury funding account The second is the anti-reflexivity mechanic This is a system where a MetaDAO starts to issue and sell new tokens if it\u2019s valuation is increasing. Up to 2 billion tokens are sold based on a near linear function starting at a valuation of around 20 million and continuing until a valuation of around 450 million is reached. It both acts as a brake on irrational market behaviour or pump and dump attempts, and it also captures market price increases of the MetaDAO tokens and converts it into junior capital. This mechanism strictly provides junior capital for the MetaDAO since it accumulates elixir directly, it doesn\u2019t provide cash to the surplus buffer that can be used for workforce expenses. Link to description in the Endgame Overview: Anti Reflexivity Mechanic The final mechanism is the Drizzle Engine Unlike the two temporary mechanisms above, the Drizzle Engine is permanent. Very simply it can be seen as a milder, permanent version of the anti reflexivity mechanic that aims to smoothen irrational price behaviour and capture price increases into Elixir accumulation. It works based on the MetaDAO emitting up to 3% of its total token supply each year into the Drizzle Engine (unless the Drizzle Engine already contains more than 10% of the total token supply). The MetaDAO tokens contained in the Drizzle Engine are then sold and converted to Elixir if the MetaDAO token price rises above a predefined valuation model that could for instance be based on targeting a particular P/E or P/S ratio (this will be determined by Maker Governance through the Ecosystem Scope) There isn\u2019t a great complete write up if it yet but it is shown in this Endgame Metanomics diagram alongside the MetaDAO NFT staking engine which it also interacts with. The MetaDAO internal Metanomics These mechanics, and particularly the parameters and numbers are of course still subject to discussion and change, since we need to make sure we carefully tune it for a successful and stable launch of the MetaDAOs.

                    "content": "It may be helpful to think about junior or risk capital in two \u201clayers\u201d/\u201cdimensions\u201d for Protector MetaDAO\u2019s: a) Economic Loss Risk Capital This is the layer of junior capital that is standard in TradFi if you follow market standard \u201crules of the game\u201d for being a senior/low-risk type investor. I.e. if you buy AAA structured credit positions they would have 15%+ of junior capital from other parties attached to them on the ultimate end-loans etc. So when a Proctector MetaDAO work with an Arrange, this type of junior/risk capital is required. Such that through external junior/risk capital the Protector MetaDAO should be well protected against economic loss. Adding a layer to this from the MetaDAO Surplus Buffer may make sense in the long-run as credit situations or asset gets more complex, but generally the vast majority junior/risk capital for economic loss should come from structures with external risk/junior capital. At least at the inception very limited economic loss capital should be considered to arrive from Surplus Buffer and the portfolios of the Protector MetaDAO constructed accordingly. b) Emergency Liquidation Loss Risk Capital Then we have the \u201cbank run\u201d situation. Basically the MetaDAO have to liquidate assets/credit positions immediately. Depending upon how the MetaDAO portfolio is setup there could be emergency liquidation losses (from market stress, market value variability, asset being semi-illiquid etc etc). This is where the MetaDAO Surplus Buffers principal role kicks in - it has to cover these liquidation losses. I am probably less worried about the economic loss risk capital: it is a reasonably well-known construct and concern - and there exists many people and institutions with many years of experience managing this appropriately that Protector MetaDAO can access and work with. It is the Emergency Liquidation Loss capital that deserves attention. But - I think you will see that the Protector MetaDAO clusters are well-aware of this and are deliberately developing portfolios to match the state of the Protector MetaDAO\u2019s Surplus Buffer - and with path for rebalancing portfolios as the Surplus Buffers strengthens.

How big will the junior capital be, how will it be sized versus specific deal and overall portfolio risk?  2.  What is the source of this junior capital?  (if its from Maker, it is not junior capital)  a credible RWA metaDAO proposal (and structure) would thoughtfully address this KEY issue and several others.  Without this information a RWA metaDAO proposal is more a wish list than a serious proposal ",
