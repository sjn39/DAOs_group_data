Honesty is welcomed here, we\u2019re all trying to make a better DAO. I\u2019d love to hear your perspective on how core units are developing. How would you like to see these core units further developed? What do you believe is working? What isn\u2019t working? What areas can be improved? For better discourse, I suggest splitting topics into segments such as:  The Core Unit Framework current experience and process Diversity and quality of core units being proposed and onboarded General Budgets (accounting, amount, etc) Aspects that should encompass consistently across core units vs on an individual core unit level  There will be a separate forum thread about incentives and vesting. Additionally, to get a full perspective, it would be helpful to include your participation: ie. new community member, Governance community member (MKR holder or active participant) and proposed a core unit, contemplating proposing a core unit, will not form a core unit, etc. ",

If not, could you point me to where I should be asking this? My specific question is the following - what happens if a Core Unit underperforms in some way? What oversight procedures do we have, aside from decreasing or removing funding to the CU via a governance vote? For example, a CU like Risk always needs to exist and cutting funding is not really a good solution. If it performs poorly by some arbitrary metric, what happens next? ",

As soon as there\u2019s this kind of competitive and diversified ecosystem it becomes a lot easier to just offboard the worst performing teams without having to worry about major disruption. ",
