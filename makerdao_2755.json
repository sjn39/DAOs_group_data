Welcome to our collateral onboarding call #10 held on October 7th, 2020 at 5PM UTC. My name is Juan. I\u2019m here with 24 participants. Today we will have two of my favorite projects in collateral onboarding. We will have Fernando Martinelli from Balancer and Matt Luongo presenting tBTC - Keep Network. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.   Balancer  [BAL] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application - Forum Thread [BPT-80BAL-20WETH] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application - Forum Thread  Fernando Martinelli Presentation 00:50 Intro1393\u00d7651 78.7 KB Balancer allows flexible liquidity polls1395\u00d7784 113 KB Two types of Pools1170\u00d7789 65.1 KB Special type: Smart Pools1386\u00d7779 92.6 KB Other Smart Pool ideas1169\u00d7780 133 KB Discussion  11:35 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: When I add liquidity to a pool I get BPT tokens so what\u2019s the way to know which liquidity pool those BPT tokens come from? 13:10 - Nik Kunkel: From an Oracle perspective, how would you value a BPT token? Is it just the underlying and if it is how do you make sure that the ratio isn\u2019t manipulable to manipulate the price of a BPT token? 14:40: Nik Kunkel: Is there a way to normalize the ratio over time? 15:50 - LongForWisdom: With any liquidity pool, the risk of the pool is contingent on the risk of the weakest token in the pool? 18:20 - Primoz: In case MakerDAO considers to onboard BPTs, the idea is that Maker boots yields of liquidity providers, so we would be obviously charging stability fee that is a percentage of liquidity mining rewards. I know that those rewards are a function of Balancer price but also of the distribution. So, how do the distribution and the money incentives work? How frequent does it change? What\u2019s the actual framework there? Is it community based? 23:40 - LongForWisdom: We\u2019re considering onboarding BAL itself as well, how value accrues to the BAL token? Is it planned that a fee from the pools is going to go towards buy and burn for BAL in the future?  25:50 - Akash: With the Balancer liquidity pool tokens, is there a way to go backwards and figure what the weights are for the pool?  26:05 - Akash: If there is XYZ token with ETH and then you create Balancer tokens that then go into Maker and then you mint Dai, you lever up. The mark Maker who\u2019s on the other side when liquidations happens will have no liquidity in terms of liquidating the underlying tokens, right? They would get these liquidity tokens go back to Balancer or pull off the underlying tokens and there would be no place to sell it.  tBTC  [TBTC] Proposal for Collateral Onboarding - tBTC - Forum Thread  Matt Luongo Presentation 28:15 Intro1433\u00d7829 92.5 KB Agenda1435\u00d7814 88 KB Bringing Bitcoin to ETH1436\u00d7814 141 KB System Design1077\u00d7649 151 KB Cross Chain Pegging Dilemma1432\u00d7635 188 KB Bug735\u00d7587 137 KB tBTC rc1 Release1435\u00d7731 74.4 KB Guarded Release Schedule1404\u00d7715 96.9 KB tBTC on Mainnet1184\u00d7757 125 KB Total Value Locked1190\u00d7796 76.7 KB Growth1341\u00d7737 60.4 KB Deposits and Redeems1438\u00d7687 98.6 KB Cumulative Volume1007\u00d7822 144 KB Keep Stats1289\u00d7728 132 KB tBTC Community Engagement1085\u00d7762 208 KB Community Liquidity1300\u00d7778 153 KB Incentivize bitcoin on MakerDAO1432\u00d7769 87.6 KB Discussion  43:00 - LongForWisdom: I have a comment on incentivizing Dai minting. We talked about the same with Maker and one of the reasons why I\u2019ve personally thought it\u2019s a bad idea is, there\u2019s nothing really in forcing someone to sell the Dai, it\u2019s actually safer if they hold on to it. 44:00 - S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Can I get an idea of what is the business model of the company behind the tBTC because there are some work tokens so you would expect cash flows but it seems that tBTc is not quite expensive? 45:15 - LongForWisdom: Do those fees come in bitcoins? 46:25 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: I have a question regarding the ETH. It seems like the tBTC\u2019s collateral twice, maybe? That you would hold the BTC on the BTC MultiSig contract potentially and on the other hand you would also hold enough ETH so that if one of the contract fails you have the backup from the ETH, is that how it works?  48:35 - Primoz: Since liquidity is not great yet, how long does BTC redemption process take? 50:20 - LongForWisdom: I think the focus of this question is that keepers keep their bid on tBTC on Maker in the case of a Maker Liquidation, how long it takes those keepers to get to go from that tBTC back to Dai? 52:10 - Frank Cruz: Are you guys looking into doing any other bridges to other L1s?  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 54:50  Thank you Matt again for coming, it was very informative. Let\u2019s keep the conversation going on in the Forum. Thanks again to Fernando for presenting in the first half and everyone else for participating here. See you in the forums!  Credits  Gala Guill\u00e9n produced this summary.
