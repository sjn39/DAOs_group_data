Because Ethereum Protocol Development makes a secure, reliable, and performant Layer 1 possible, it is the foundation of the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Here is a photoshopped xkcd comic that iillustrates this point.  All of the Ethereum ecosystem rests on these public goods.  This infrastructure is considered by many to be underfunded.  Here is a graph from @vbuterin 's article The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy which shows the relative amount spent on R&D (Protocol Development) relative to PoW spending (spending on security)  Screen Shot 2022-03-21 at 7.46.42 PM1348\u00d7676 142 KB  Anyway, this came to a boiling point last week. I\u2019m not sure if you all saw, but over the last days a debate has resurfaced around protocol developer compensation, burnout, and retainment issues in the Ethereum ecosystem.   twitter.com    Rene \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 @renelubov  the protocol engineer to burnout to defi pipeline   1:35 PM - 18 Mar 2022           154                6              twitter.com    DCinvestor.eth @iamDCinvestor  pay all Ethereum core devs a minimum of $350K+ per year. more for senior devs  a rounding error for the size of the @ethereum hoard  stop the BS on why they need to work for nothing and get it done so that they can take care of their families and feel good about their work   12:58 PM - 20 Mar 2022           2.2K                129              twitter.com    smartcontracts \ud83d\udd34\u2728 @kelvinfichter  Core dev work is a public good and the convos around low comp and high burnout rates make it yet again clear that the Ethereum community has not solved the problem of appropriately, fairly, and transparently rewarding even the most basic public goods for the impact they provide.   P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) @peter_szilagyi  It's problematic. The Geth team is fully funded by the EF. As such, we feel it's bad practice to open up an alternative funding source, lest we end up without EF funding (like certain other projects).    12:04 PM - 20 Mar 2022           113                13            This conversation is of course relevant to us, because our mission is to build and fund digital public goods. We actually started off in Gitcoin Grants Round 1 funding the Ethereum ecosystem, and grew that heavily from Round 1 to Round 7.  Around Round 7, we started scaling out to Gitcoin Grants Side Rounds and Gitcoin Aqueduct . As the debate around Ethereum Protocol Dev Comp was brought up, there was some constructive criticism around Gitcoin\u2019s offering that I think is worth taking seriously.  The debates were not about Gitcoin, they are about creating a better outcome for protocol devs (which retains them), but I do think the commentary about us and our offering towards that goal is worth taking seriously.   twitter.com    Alexey Sharp \ud83e\udda6\ud83e\uddec\ud83d\ude9b\ud83d\ude9a\ud83d\ude9b\ud83d\ude9a\ud83d\ude9b @realLedgerwatch  @lawmaster @iamDCinvestor @siromivel @ethereum We did not market sell anything to the community, and also I have given up on gitcoin some time ago, because it is just not working well at the scale required for us - more trouble than it's worth   12:58 PM - 20 Mar 2022           15              twitter.com   trent.eth (yes, yes) @trent_vanepps  I just funded 27 grants on @gitcoin!  see the full list here: https://t.co/Tpxdo1HjnU   .. disappointed to see how many amazing Ethereum grants are losing out on matching funds to a lot of NFT / DeFi / Metaverse projects that are IMO nowhere near public goods \ud83d\ude2c   10:55 AM - 16 Mar 2022           50                7            I want to invite the Gitcoin community to participate in the above debates. Here is my prompt: Ethereum Protocol Development is a public good, and it\u2019s possibly the closest one to the ecosystem that gave Gitcoin life. Can Gitcoin be doing more to support Ethereum Protocol Devs? ",

                    "content": "This is a really important conversation and particularly timely as I\u2019ve been starting to talk to some matching funders about supporting a core infrastructure round in GR14. In the earliest days of Gitcoin Grants, during the depths of the bear market, most of our top grantees were working on relatively unknown projects that over time the entire ecosystem would come to benefit from. A few that come to mind include:  Dune Analytics EIP-1559 community development Ethers.js Lighthouse Prysm Hardhat Plasma Group (now Optimism) Snapshot WalletConnect  Many of these projects are well known and well loved (for good reason) today.  As the ecosystem grew, however, a larger percentage of projects focused on applications and community initiatives, and although the pool size expanded, the share of funds available to infrastructure projects stayed constant and even began to shrink. To be sure, so many of these were great projects in their own right including:  Bankless Dark Forest POAP Proof of Humanity MetaCartel The Defiant Uniswap   The amounts all of the projects raised weren\u2019t in the seven, eight, or even nine figure range that we\u2019re seeing many folks raise at today, but they were meaningful at a time when very few people believed in what Ethereum could become and what it could mean for internet-native coordination and collaboration. In turn, thanks to not just our work but the work of many others like Ecosystem Support these projects survived the bear market. Unfortunately, however, the bull market gains for those building in the application and community layers was, on average, far greater than those building core infrastructure. Over time, more and more infrastructure builders moved on to do far more rewarding work in the emerging DeFi and NFT spaces. Naturally, those who stayed behind have not had the same bull market as many folks reading this. So, if we want to take the idea of retroactive public goods funding seriously, which I believe we should, then the value those who helped build our ecosystem receive should be commensurate with the value they\u2019ve added. And in that light, we should look carefully at exactly how much we all owe to the core infrastructure right underneath us. With that said, I\u2019d welcome any support in making a core infrastructure round happen, and recommend we do our best to ensure that we\u2019re paying our respects to those that continue to do the hard work even in the face of endless opportunities for short term gains. Let\u2019s continue to support the future we want to see. Public goods are good. ",

The primary goals: to provide autonomous tools for recruitment, retention, and reward to the protocol and its maintainers. If desired, individuals can forward their allocation to a charity.  Some resources for people to learn more:  Schelling point video: Overview of the Protocol Guild. Read the docs December announcement   We have a grant for Protocol Guild but as I mentioned in the tweet linked above, there is a ton of competition from things I wouldn\u2019t really consider aiming for any public benefit. We\u2019d love to talk about how our membership can provide any guidance to a possible \u201cCore Protocol\u201d GR14 side round! ",

Alternatively, an application process for core devs to apply to a deeply funded QF pool, possibly informed by the EF regarding eligibility and criteria.

While the Guild does have a very broad membership (and growing weekly), there are still some areas we haven\u2019t expanded our curation into: libraries, solidity tooling, ethereum infra community projects (eg. ethstaker, archivenode.io, Otterscan). I think these existing Gitcoin Grant participants should also be eligible for a side round of this type, were it to be included in GR14. I will think more about how weighting should play a role with matching funds, given the PG grant will represent +100 contributors, and some of the other grants are low single digit contributors. ",

I\u2019ll echo Trent that I think protocol guild is a great candidate for something like this, and can likely provide more comprehensive (or at the very least, complementary) curation than the existing grants, which only cover a subset of clients. When talking with potential funders for the protocol guild, one thing that came up frequently was that they\u2019d like to donate to \u201cclasses\u201d of projects, e.g. client devs, tooling/libraries, programming languages, etc. so having some granularity at that level can help them direct their donations. Beyond that, though, it seemed hard for them to make an educated judgement on how funds should be split more granularly. Hopefully PG can solve this for client devs+researchers, and eventually expand (or have others come and create!) to provide a similar thing for libraries, languages, etc. ",
