The proposal:  Iterates from @williamr\u2019s original vision for RWAs. Promotes decentralization. Encourages competition. Reflects the global nature of Maker\u2019s opportunities and the different time zones of the key contributors   Paragraph Summary MIP39c2-SP34 splits the current Real World Finance Core Unit (RWF-001) into two separate Core Units and allocate the existing RWF-001 personnel and budget between the two separate Core Units. The two Core Units will be RWF-0x and RWF-001. The existing RWF-001 budget for personnel and operational expenditures (including external legal) will be allocated as follows:  RWF-0x: 75% RWF-001: 25%  The Core Unit Facilitator for RWF-0x will be @christiancdpetersen. The Core Unit Facilitator for RWF-001 will remain @williamr. The proposal will not increase the administrative overhead for Maker token holders. Instead, the division of the existing Core Unit will encourage decentralization, specialization, transparency, accountability, and efficiency.  Specification  Motivation The current RWF-001 Core Unit Facilitator has long-standing relationships with some of the existing and potential MIP6 applicants. Further, the current RWF-001 Facilitator enhances Maker\u2019s geographical diversity with a physical location in the Asia-Pacific. The split will allow RWF-001 to dedicate time to focus on opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region and not be impeded by the transactional demands of RWF-0x and associated transactions. Prospective RWF-0x Core Unit members have, working jointly:  Successfully structured, implemented and onboarded Huntingdon Valley Bank and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (130MM DAI in RWAs). Through the aforementioned transactions, developed the market standard for how RWAs are ledgered and financed on-chain. Professionalized the onboarding of real-world assets by developing and communicating investment guidelines. Transparently reviewed MIP6 applications and made reasoned recommendations for proposed collateral onboardings (for or against). Collaborated with Centrifuge to scale the Centrifuge offering for Maker through the indentured trust. Enriched the discourse around and long-term framework for how to approach RWAs more holistically. Implemented mechanisms to improve Maker token holder visibility over collateral. Demonstrated a propensity for working with one another synergistically.  As RWAs become increasingly fundamental to the success of the DAO, this reorganization supports the appropriate specialization and decentralization needed to proceed responsibly. The Maker token holders will benefit from a division of the existing Real World Finance core unit into two separate core units for the following reasons:  Separate Core Units will encourage contributors with similar skill sets, commercial approaches, and execution styles to collaborate more effectively, efficiently, and innovatively for the benefit of the Maker token holders. Separate Core Units will provide an opportunity for Maker token holders to measure and evaluate independent performance, as each Core Unit will be responsible for the development, execution, and maintenance of its transactions. Separate Core Units will promote more diverse innovation within and without the Maker ecosystem. Separate Core Units will result in more decentralization, dispersion, and competition with the best approaches and innovations winning out. Separate Core Units do not change or limit the authority of the Maker token holders. Over time, the Maker token holders may elect to devolve more or less authority to the Core Units depending on the Core Unit\u2019s performance. Separate Core Units give potential MIP6 applicants more diverse options. Splitting the current Real-World Finance Core Unit achieves a strategic objective without associated fiscal expansion \u2014 a nice double-whammy during a bear market.   Core Unit ID RWF-0x  Core Unit Name RWF-0x  Core Unit Mandate Each of RWF-0x and RWF-001 will be independently responsible for the development, prioritization, and execution of its own generated transactions greenlit by the Maker token holders. RWF-0x and RWF-001 will compete for mandates from potential customers to the Maker protocol. Subsequent to the initial split budget, RWF-0x and RWF-001 may propose their own budgets, incentives, etc. Each of RWF-0x and RWF-001 will continue to interface with other Maker DAO Core Units as necessary to implement transactions. Unless the Maker token holders determine another allocation on existing collateral:  RWF-0x will be responsible for Huntingdon Valley Bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 6S Capital, and New Silver. RWF-001 will be responsible for Fortunafi, ConsolFreight, and Harbor Trade Credit.  In respect of existing or greenlit MIP6 applications, RWF-001 will be responsible for Robinland and ATD Combustors. RWF-0x will be responsible for Pando (if greenlit). For pre-greenlit MIP6 applications arising after the date of submission of this MIP proposal, MIP6 applicants may choose to interact with either RWF-0x or RWF-001. RWF-0x and RWF-001 will coordinate activities to ensure that other Core Units are not burdened by the split.  Continuity Until RWF-0x is approved and receives its DAI budget within the 2-of-3 multisig, the current Facilitator of RWF-001 will continue to compensate Core Unit members @christiancdpetersen, @teej, and @eumenes as per the agreed upon MKR and DAI obligations. This will enable ongoing processing of the current and future pipeline of proposals. Further, until RWF-0x is approved and receives its budget allocation, @williamr will not make any additional modifications to the RWF-001 budget, included but not limited to returning DAI to the treasury. As such, if RWF-0x is for any reason, not approved, RWF-001 will continue to operate as is, with all obligations to Core Unit members in MKR and DAI being respected.  Monetalis (MIP65) and Liquidity Opportunities During the interim period, @christiancdpetersen will support the implementation of Monetalis MIP65 and other strategic finance initiatives greenlit and/or approved by Maker token holders and be compensated through RWF-001. RWF-0x will assume such amounts as a deduction from its budget when the actual budget split occurs. @christiancdpetersen will maintain detailed time and other records to evidence such amounts. After the formal split into RWF-001 and RWF-0x, @christiancdpetersen will provide support to the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) on various initiatives brought to the Maker token holders by SF-001. For such work, @christiancdpetersen\u2019s time and any third-party legal expenses will be paid from the RWF-0x budget.

The budget proposal would replace the current RWF-001 Core Unit\u2019s budget. If this onboarding passes, 75% of the budget that is currently being allocated to RWF-001 CU, will be transferred from RWF-001 CU to RWF-0x CU. The budget proposal has a breakdown for the RWF-0x CU\u2019s part (75%). RWF-0x commits to submit a budget for 2023 no later than October 12, 2022.

The pain is real. @christiancdpetersen is willing to work on MIP65 and other bonds-like SF projects but I would love to have confirmation from @williamr that he is willing to fund those expenses and the workers. Some projects also need the rest of the RWF team to work on and provide another set of eyes. We need to get things done. I also understand that some parties want to have MIP65 done and don\u2019t care about the rest. This is very shortsighted. What we can learn from the ALM forecast is that we need to deliver on investing. The proposed RWF-0x team has a track record on that.

The moment we have two truly independent RWA CUs, they are going to start competing with each other for budgets and headcount.

Will these be 2 different metadaos or clustered back into 1 metadao? ",

                    "content": "This is an extremely interesting evolution and, please pass this to me, a clear example of the usefulness of a audit/ oversight core unit like LOVE. By reading the proposal drafted by @christiancdpetersen and especially @SebVentures commentary, it is clear that RWF-001 has had internal dysfunctionalities that have led to this request. As @CodeKnight hints at, with the similar people being involved in RWF-001 under @williamr\u2019s facilitation - namely all CU members, and seeking for spin-off into another core unit, this seems to me a de facto off-boarding of the CU Facilitator with a reduction in budget. Which, in my opinion as an external observer, seems plausible given the above mentioned dysfunctionalities and the fact that the individuals proposing this MIP have been involved in 100% of the workload performed to structure and pass the most recent RWF MIPs. Going back to @CodeKnight\u2019s points, I agree that two independent core units should be:  Mandated independently Staffed and budgeted independently Assessed independently  For this reason, I truly hope that the discussion over this MIP aren\u2019t commingled with the discussions with the performance of @williamr as facilitator of RWF-001. I would also like to understand in detail the gap analysis between RWF-001 mandate and this CU - the result could also be no difference but pure duplication of points of contact. I do not believe that this should cause any concern for an increase in costs, but rather please those who seek decentralisation. Unfortunately, without an third party audit function, there will not be anyone staffed at the DAO level able to review the quality and intensity of the independent yet partially overlapping core units. As part of the closing activities of the Lending Oversight incubation, I have already agreed with @wouter, @Juan, @Retro from SES to publish an audit report of RWF-001 activities. I will do this before the end of the RFC period for this proposal, to provide MKR holders potentially useful information for decision making. Regarding the below on Endgame Plan, I have fundamental questions that I will pose again.     CodeKnight:  Also, how do you see this working with the endgame plan? Will these be 2 different metadaos or clustered back into 1 metadao?    Can anyone truly articulate in a simple manner what MetaDAOs are, and what is their relationship with the existing Core Unit set up? I am not looking for a 50 pages summary Has the Endgame framework received any type of MKR endorsement that justify diverting significant CU resources to studying the transition? I have asked the question already below without any answer     Short take: Exciting news and opportunity for RWA teams   I wonder whether there is any vote that has been passed and gives authority to CU Facilitators to spend time and resources to adapt towards a new framework - in this case the MetaDAO framework which hasn\u2019t been voted on. If I am wrong and missing something I apologise.   To clarify my position, I have had close to no interactions with anyone belonging to RWF-001 following the negative outcome of the LOVE-001 vote, nor I have been involved in drafting this proposal. However, being this consistent with the decentralisation process I had anticipated for important CUs (including RWF), I am now watching this with interest as community member. ",

Whether competition is good for the DAO seems to be beyond the point, as well as whether the actual incubees are competing for existing resources (should we have more specialized Core Units, or should we have big Core Unit working on several projects). As part of the unwinding of the LOVE incubation program, @luca_pro mentioned the programs he was working on and what he would like to accomplish as the program comes to an end.

                    "content": "My proposal to form RWF-0x results from my conclusion that, after working as a team for nearly a year, myself, @eumenes and @teej can efficiently and effectively (and we have already done) execute on a Real World Asset vision supported by the Maker token holders. Also, we can, as experienced professionals in the traditional finance space, meaningfully and proactively engage with the Maker community to develop a holistic real world asset strategy - meaning communicating ideas and options, debating the same and, after approval, executing a real world asset strategy. I believe that RWAs are core to the protocol\u2019s success and to MKR\u2019s performance as an asset. As such, the DAO should promote core units with The Right Stuff\u2014sometimes hard decisions have to be made in the short-term to protect the long-term. My proposal does not exclude or prohibit a MetaDAO or any other agreed upon approach. I have lost confidence in @williamr\u2019s capacity and engagement in promoting real world assets. Over the last several months, I felt that, time and time again, @williamr set RWF-001 up for long-term failure in the Real World Asset space and with the Maker community. My lack of confidence substantially increased from May onwards, but I did not want to make any changes while we executed the HVB and SG Forge transactions. The details are not important, but it is sufficient to note that, last week, I told @williamr that I resigned from RWF-001 pending finalization of the HVB and SG Forge transactions. To ensure continuity in the RWA program, I (together with @eumenes and @teej) suggested to @williamr that he step down as core facilitator. He did not directly respond to this proposal. He did, however, indirectly respond by proposing that @eumenes and @teej spin out a North America-only core unit. Building upon this idea, we drafted a formal proposal in good faith to split RWF-001 into two core units. We shared this proposal with williamr and suggested it be co-authored, but again, he failed to respond. Several days later, we received a sort of response. This morning, each of myself, @eumenes, and @teej received a termination email. As any professional will probably agree, a lack of execution, lack of engagement, poor communication, and vindictive, non-performance based termination are not the trappings of leadership. To reiterate, my sole objective in the proposal to create RWF-0x is to assist the Maker community to develop, debate, and implement a long-term strategy for the on-boarding of real world assets. Maker has an enviable lead in the Real World Asset space and it will require dedication, finance experience, and proactive engagement to maximize the potential for merging Real World Assets with crypto and improve upon the existing financing structure. I have always indicated that I work for the benefit of the Maker token holders. I expect the Maker token holders to hold me accountable for professionalism, proactive engagement, and execution. ",

I have offered to support Monetalis (Clydesdale) MIP65 and @strat-fin-core-unit with the same budgeted dollars (more output and less aggregate cost). Of course, RWA-0x will be subject to the regular budgetary process for 2023. I expect Maker token holders to question and challenge any budgetary assumptions for RWF-0x.   Maker token holders should hold me accountable for work promised to be done and work done. I am about execution. That is why I have decided to make this proposal.   Competing, decentralized core units should increase the potential pie and rewards to Maker (not restrict it). Maker token holders should expect performance. If a core unit or member fails to perform, then budgets can be reduced and Core Units eliminated. Core units are, after all, servants to the Maker token holders.   In terms of \u201cdisputes\u201d, I would argue that competing, decentralized core units minimize disputes and eliminate fears of \u201cgate keeping\u201d etc. A MIP6 applicant can \u201calways go across the street\u201d. This competition will force the core units to consider the Maker token holders and the customer.   Competition between two (or more) RWFs will give MKR holders more insight into each RWF as they can compare performance across each RWF, noting strengths and weaknesses.   In terms of MetaDAOs, nothing in this proposal excludes or prohibits MetaDAOs. In fact, competing teams might serve as an experimental petri-dish for the MetaDAO concept.   ",

He did not directly respond to this proposal. He did, however, indirectly respond by proposing that @eumenes and @teej spin out a North America-only core unit . Building upon this idea, we drafted a formal proposal in good faith to split RWF-001 into two core units. We shared this proposal with williamr and suggested it be co-authored, but again, he failed to respond.   From my point of view, I find the proposal very interesting, however I do not like the way it wants to be executed, from the accusation, whether true or not, that Williams does not work efficiently, to creating an unhealthy division between RWA . If we think in the future, to divide some CUs in a healthy and enjoyable way, this would be the best way to face the feeling of workers in some CUs, but with this conclusion they are probably placing a versus between both RWAs instead of emphasizing, lightening and at some point exchange ideas between CU. I wouldn\u2019t mind if RWA sw would split even by continents, but if it would split thanks to a necessary conclusion to make jobs easier and not because a worker or some workers don\u2019t work well. So if the new RWA does not have such a high labor morale, will we repeat the same procedure? Shall we blame a member and divide again? My point of view is, I love the idea of \u200b\u200bgeo-zoning but not doing it this way, due to a \u201ccu-mate deficiency\u201d ",

Onboarding and managing collateral is cross-CU process that is not solely dependent upon a single Core Unit. First, there is a well-documented process and many collateral applications have a fair amount of work already completed once they are posted on the forum.  We also have collateral stakeholders and domain teams that have a variety of responsibilities within this process. To freeze work due to internal conflicts would be an overreaction to something that can be adequately managed. Where there are dependencies and gaps, the collateral stakeholders identify them and work to resolve the issues. I\u2019m asking everyone not to conflate a conflict or change in strategy with the actual work that is being completed as listed on the CSI. We are working with @williamr and the ex-RWF team members to ensure a smooth transition and business continuity. ",
