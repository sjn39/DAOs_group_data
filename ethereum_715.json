It is on the ETHCC schedule under my name for 16:00 in Robert Faure. My goal for it is to have a space where people can come and share the questions they have, and either get pointed to resources \u2013 like EthHub or the roadmap on the wiki \u2013 or capture those questions so that we can have discussions and find answers to them. The guiding question is \u201cWhat is the ETH1x Roadmap?\u201d. Necessarily, this connects into planning for ETH2, and I definitely think there are a lot of ETH1 to ETH2 questions that are still open. @lrettig said previously that he would volunteer to facilitate. I believe that a fishbowl format as we did for the ETH2 session at Council of Prague would be good to run this. For now, I\u2019m asking for your help in:  gathering resources \u2013 do you have good ETH1x materials to share like @AlexeyAkhunov\u2019s state rent writings and presentations? gathering questions \u2013 what questions do you have? Post them as a comment, and people can \u201cheart\u201d them if they have the same question.  Follow Up The #working-groups:ethereum-1-x-ring is the place for discussion and further work. The #istanbul tag can be used to track items related to the upcoming hard fork. This post can be edited directly, or leave comments. ",

Reading time: 7 min read       Here is a rough transcript of his comments:  Whether ETH 1.x becomes a shard is really a community question, a research question. Though there are some technical challenges depending on the option. Option 1: Roll ETH 1.0 into 2.0 once it reached an acceptable stability. (but how?) Option 1A: 1.x as exceptional shard construction \u2014 however, separate rules from other shards and a legacy code base is really bad combination. Also wouldn\u2019t be compatible with forecasted need for state fees. Option 1B (favored by danny): write EVM interpreter in WASM. deploy as contract on ETH2.0\u2014 fork state root into contract and ether balances, then users can interact with 1.0 state by providing \u201cmerkel witnesses.\u201d The community could then deprecate maintenance for ETH 1.0 but still interact with the historic state. Stateless nature means there wouldn\u2019t be any issues with state fees. Option 2: allow legacy chain to operate in perpetuity. At this point there is potential to use ETH 2.0 to finalise 1.0, allowing mining rewards to decrease further. Option 3: Have mining rewards be a function of how much ETH is left on ETH 1.0 Generally, he thinks there are \u201cpromises\u201d that need to be upheld, like an Augur market related to Mars that expires in many years.
