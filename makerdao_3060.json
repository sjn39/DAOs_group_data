Paragraph Summary As the community continues to tweak the system, one attribute that is sometimes modified is the Surplus Buffer. DAI once over the Surplus Buffer the triggers the FLAP auction to go acquire MKR from the market. One can imagine that if the Surplus Buffer is set to 100MM DAI (and is full) that if governance then subsequently shifts to a materially lower Surplus Buffer of 2MM DAI, it would \u201cslam\u201d the FLAP auction causing a surge of MKR buying and thus huge inefficiencies with price. As it is administratively annoying to reduce the Surplus Buffer manually by governance for a set amount each week (e.g. 2MM decrease per week) as it would require the same vote over and over, this MIP proposes to modify the Surplus Buffer in an automated linear manner using three fundamental variables.   Time to reach the target   The target itself   Frequency of the reduction   From there the Surplus Buffer would then be modified (up or down) over time and with the frequency determined by governance. The frequency if set to zero would throttle the buffer down per block or could be set at a higher number if governance wants to have a more edgy reduction. The above scenario is magnified as the system gets larger. Component Summary MIPXXc1: Time where the time to reach the target is defined. MIPXXc2: Target where the Surplus Buffer will ultimately arrive at the time above. MIPXXc3: Frequency the pace at which the above changes will be implemented (e.g. per block or per hour, etc) Motivation See paragraph summary above. Specification MIPXXcX: Smart Contract Components See component summary above MIPXXcX: Proposed Code (WIP) Pending MIPXXcX: Test Cases   Increase the surplus buffer with zero time with Y frequency   Increase the surplus buffer with X days time with Y frequency   Decrease the surplus buffer with zero time with Y frequency   Decrease the surplus buffer with X days time with Y frequency   MIPXXcX: Auditor Information and Report The code has not been audited (as it has yet to be written). Prior to any executive vote, the smart contracts domain team shall determine if an audit and bug bounty program is necessary. ",
