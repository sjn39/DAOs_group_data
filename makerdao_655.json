We have growth wanting to figure out how to get more DAI out there yet as far as I can tell we don\u2019t even really know the state of our vault users in terms of activity vs. size, much less what they are doing to either repay their DAI or when the mint it. Without real drill down information on our vault users here I feel like we are just making up a narrative that everything is fine, when in fact we have already passed 60% again with stablecoins backing DAI (this has happened a few times) and don\u2019t really have a good handle on what the SF paying 40% DAI borrowers are up to.
