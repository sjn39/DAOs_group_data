                    "content": "jokedao: the quick story jokedao is building community-led governance experiments for DAOs to build soft consensus. We launched last month and are already being used by Tally, Aave, Packy Mccormick (Not Boring), Austin Griffith (BuidlGuidl), Juicebox, and many more. Got 5 minutes? Here is an explainer tweet: https://twitter.com/jokedao_/status/1549053081266008065 What is Jokedao? http://www.jokedao.io jokedao enables bottom-up, on-chain governance, letting token-holders submit proposals and vote on their favorites\u2014enabling community-set governance for user-generated roadmaps, grants, endorsements, bounties, curation, and contests. It flips the way governance has been done: now it\u2019s the community itself that can respond to prompts by submitting ideas and voting on them. For the first time, the community is incentivized to raise their voice, and governance becomes truly decentralized\u2014as well as gamified and fun. jokedao contests are held in two periods. During the submissions period, communities can respond to prompts with proposals.  1600\u00d7889 141 KB   1326\u00d71234 130 KB  During the voting period, communities can vote on their favorite proposals to gauge the relative prioritization of each.  1600\u00d7880 137 KB   1600\u00d71369 130 KB  Decentralized governance is particularly useful for incentivizing use cases for builders and creators, including:  Grants Endorsements Bounties Competitions Giveaways User-generated roadmaps User surveys Fans picking content creators\u2019 next topic, podcast guest, etc.  Proposal: Using jokedao to build soft consensus at MakerDAO that will:  formalize community ideas and preferences enable builders to develop proposals that are most in line with the community\u2019s vision let community submit alternate versions of proposals to build consensus around the best version generate greater consensus and alignment around proposals  Three Use Cases: Case 1: Pulse Checks and Prioritization Framework MakerDAO could hold regular \u201cpulse checks\u201d to see what kind of projects the community wanted to prioritize\u2014for example, RWAs, diversifying collateral, adding committees, etc. The community could submit and vote on favorites to get an early pulse check of what kind of proposals MakerDAO prioritizes and would likely pass. Instead of only builders proposing projects they personally planned to develop, now the entire community could participate in suggesting the projects they\u2019d like to see. Builders would also have a sense of which projects to build fuller proposals around, with far greater likelihood of consensus and success given the early pulse check. To do so we could airdrop MKR holders a Prio token that they can then use to submit up to three proposals for short-term priorities or project ideas. (The same could also be done for DAI holders, to contrast the desires of DAI holders with those of MKR holders, or surface overlaps and synergies.) Multi-contest pulse checks could even serve to differentiate between strategic and tactical goals, as a first round could focus on strategic priorities (e.g. lower vault stability fees) and a second, follow-up round could focus on tactical goals for meeting these. Case 2: Building Community Initiatives After a pulse check has been conducted, MakerDAO will have strong insight into the priorities of the community and can hold a contest for members to submit a proposal around the top priority. For example, let\u2019s say the community had voted that \u201cdiversifying collateral\u201d was their top priority. Now, MakerDAO could hold a contest for the best proposal to diversify collateral. Members could submit fuller proposals on the best way to diversify collateral and then vote on their favorites, reaching soft consensus through governance about how to move forward. Instead of the builders having to generate the full idea and scope of how to proceed, the community could generate ideas for what they would want to see\u2014and builders would be able to step up to work on projects that already had clear support. Case 3: Submitting Alternate Versions of Proposals Finally, the winning proposal could be submitted in a final contest for feedback and improvements. Currently, different objectors to a proposal will often form a block of no voters\u2014though they may object to different pieces. Some might object to the timeline, others to the budget, others to the team. When these proposals inevitably fail, DAOs often experience contentious dissent while core teams scramble to resubmit a version that\u2019s more likely to pass. Instead, with our governance, a contest creator could submit a proposal as a prompt, and the community could submit alternate versions in response\u2014some changing the timeline, some the budget, others both. Ultimately the community would form consensus around the best version of the proposal that would be most likely to pass a final vote, and the builder would just need to agree to the community\u2019s terms as well.  Proposal Run a community pulse check to surface MKR holder priorities. In conjunction with Maker delegates @twblack88 and @rspa (who contributed to this proposal), we propose dropping 100 PrioToken to each address holding MKR. Every quarter a new snapshot of MKR holding addresses will be performed and a new PrioToken will be airdropped. The cost of the airdrop will be borne by the proposers until a clear and present value to the community can be established. Only then will the proposers ask for a special purpose fund to offset gas and personnel cost (~$400/quarter). The amount of 1 PrioToken per address was chosen on purpose to flatten existing power law distributions and amplify the voices of smaller MKR holders. The airdrop will be performed on the Polygon MATIC network, to make participating less cost intensive. Current gas prices on MATIC are less than 1% of Ethereum mainnet. PulseCheck process: Round 1 (three days to submit, one day to vote): Submit proposals for strategic priorities for MakerDAO Holders of 1 PrioToken can submit broad priority for MakerDAO. These goals should be top level, high abstraction, longer term proposals. (For example: Increase vault usage by 2x). Round 2 (three days to submit, one day to vote): Vote on tactical goals. Every tokenhold can vote on a single proposal with their PrioToken. Token holder votes indicate their number one priority or preference for tactical goals. ",

In general, GovAlpha thinks about things like this often. Ultimately our hands are pretty busy just trying to keep the lights on and iterate on the system we already have in place. That\u2019s why permissionless initiatives like this get me so excited, here\u2019s jokedao saying Governance deserves to be fun and explorable, two areas we could use a hand with here at Maker. While my team may be limited in the amount of hours they could help a project like this, we are no where short on passion and personally I look to be spending some of my weekend time experimenting and seeing if there\u2019s a way for us to more officially leverage the motivations and tech behind this initiative.

We certainly could use extra tools or other means to make governance more accessible, particularly for small MKR holders. This soft consensus model could do the trick nicely and it would be great to build some engagement with the wider MKR-holding community, beyond the core group who follows the forum and Discord.     divine_economy:  To do so we could airdrop MKR holders a Prio token [\u2026] (The same could also be done for DAI holders, to contrast the desires of DAI holders with those of MKR holders, or surface overlaps and synergies.)   This strikes me as a particularly interesting use case, given how tricky it is to get a sense of what DAI holders care about. In a best-case scenario, we could get some actual data on (for instance) the extent to which DAI holders value a stable peg, censorship resistance, and so forth. Of course, that is easier said than done. I do wonder whether most holders will know what to do if they get a random airdrop of PrioTokens? Personally, I ignore or hide airdrops I don\u2019t expect as I just assume they are scams (and I wouldn\u2019t click any links associated with them, either). Maybe Maker\u2019s public-facing channels (like those run by the Growth CU) could help get some information out there about the community pulse check, to build awareness and participation. In any case, I\u2019m keen to give the PulseCheck experiment a go.     twblack88:   Should we threshold MKR holdings to be 1 MKR and above?    On this point, I would be tempted to set the threshold at 0.5 MKR. Engaging a decent catchment of smaller MKR holders seems like the biggest payoff of a successful experiment. ",

Submission: What is the most exciting aspect of the Endgame Plan? Write a sentence or two about which feature or aspect of the Endgame Plan you find the most interesting and why.  Voting Upvote the ones you find interesting by distributing your tokens around. Voting for yourself is allowed, of course, but only boring people drop all their tokens on their own proposal. tradeoffs: we could prob generate some momentum and buyin with this, but could be accused of shilling.   Submission: Which features of the Endgame Plan are most urgently needed for further explanation or improvement? Please give a short explanation of what you think is missing in the current documentation on the Forums.  Voting: Vote for others if you agree and spread your tokens, so they reflect your levels of urgency or agreement with other statements. tradeoffs: I\u2019m a bit tired of looking for problems. @twblack88 has an excellent format on Friday to surface those, prob doesn\u2019t need another one, plus this isn\u2019t anonymous so that people will be shy.   Submission: Tell us a joke about the Endgame Plan.  Voting: Upvote the jokes you find funny or fitting, and downvote the ones you dislike. Go wild and don\u2019t hold back. This is for having fun. Memes also work. Disclaimer: These jokes don\u2019t represent the opinions of their writers and exist solely in a humorous context to impress and entertain others. Comment: Sometimes jesters tell the truth much better than any sage. But, there won\u2019t be anything actionable like a pulse check.    Which of these options would you prefer?  What\u2019s exciting? What needs work? Tell a joke about the Endgame Plan     0 voters     ",
