Please note this is an still in ideation phase and I\u2019d love constructive feedback from other smart people like yourselves. Shout: a proposal for an open standard for smart contract to user notifications. You can read the description here: Google Doc Tldr: smart contract message send a message to the Shout smart contract. Off-chain services can poll from the smart contract for messages. Here are my main areas of concern/discussion:  Events vs Storage I chose to persist message so services like MetaMask do not have to replay previous blocks. When to delete messages? How can current smart contracts adapt to this standard? Message schema: How can a smart contract pass dynamic data to the Shout contract? Does this even belong as an EIP?  ",
