I ended up having to use Chrome and somehow everything just worked at some point.   People were suggesting to turn off Brave Wallet and restart Brave - use a direct Metamask extension. Once I got everything working again it just worked everywhere\u2026 But I did have to kill and restart/upgrade Brave.  Ended up having to re-apply my same Metamask configuration settings. With respect to the password - you are entering the password to Metamask not the Trezor.    It should be obvious since the Trezor you have to check boxes that correspond to numbers on the display.
