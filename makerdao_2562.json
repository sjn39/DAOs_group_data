As far as I can tell, this departure was entirely on good terms. In addition, he has expressed a desire to step down from the Governance Facilitator Role effective immediately. This subproposal is largely a formality to confirm that decision and officially remove the authority and permissions Rich continues to hold under the MIPs process as a Governance Facilitator. This subproposal should in no way be seen as a condemnation of, or a reaction to Rich\u2019s performance as Governance Facilitator. Relevant Information Meeting Summary in which Rich annouced his intention to step away from his role at the Foundation. Forum thread thanking Rich for his work. ",

I\u2019m fairly sure you\u2019re joking, but I\u2019ll use it as an excuse to illustrate why this would be a bad idea. In practice not approving offboarding proposals when someone wants to be offboarded would be a mistake and has the potential to lead towards ill-will on behalf of the person in question. Realistically, if someone has decided they don\u2019t want to do a job, MKR Holders voting isn\u2019t going to force them to keep doing it. For what I hope are obvious reasons, leaving unwilling personnel in positions of power is a mistake. I\u2019ll try to provide sardonic commentary as my schedule allows. ",

FYI: Working on the MIP Tracking Spreadsheet and there are a few situations like this that are unclear and I will probably be making posts like this on items I am pretty sure were accepted as passed but can\u2019t find evidence for so sorry to be spamming the recent posts with these inquiries.
