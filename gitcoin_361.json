                    "content": "This is the AKITA communities proposal to the recent decision by Vitalik Buterin to send half of their supply to Gitcoin. 1. Summary -  Our proposal is to burn everything that VB sent except for 5%. Leave 5% to stimulate progress between both communities. The reason for 5% is because, prior to the original developer leaving the project they burned 5% of the supply. This gives the token supply a 5% window that can be extracted before starting to mess with the original token metrics of the project. I propose giving 3% to Gitcoin to fund public goods, a finders fee so to speak. Along with giving 2% to the AKITA network team to act as funding for the future of the project. We have been completely self funded thus far, and with funding could make Gitcoin\u2019s portion worth a lot more. 2. Abstract -  Implementation would be relatively easy, send the tokens that need to be burned to a burn wallet, leave Gitcoin\u2019s tokens in the multisig, send the AKITA teams tokens to our multisig. 3. Motivation - The motivation behind this proposal is to mitigate collateral damage. The Akita investors invested believing that half of our supply was \u201cburned\u201d to VBs wallet. We did not intentionally send these tokens to VB ourselves, and as such should not be punished for doing so. However our ignorance does not mean we are not subject to consequence. Gitcoin is an excellent source of funding for much needed public goods. By taking this route we can use the opportunity to educate new Ethereum users on the importance of public goods funding while staying within a range that causes as little harm as possible to the community. By holding $AKITA, Gitcoin now has a vested interest in the AKITA network project, and the AKITA network project has a vested interest in Gitcoin. By taking this peaceful approach Gitcoin will avoid any unnecessary backlash, and secure a long term source of funding, pending the AKITA communities success. The AKITA community reached a 1B valuation prior to these events. There is no reason to believe that long term success of this cooperation would not be obtainable for both parties. 4. Specification - I believe that as soon as Gitcoin announces this burn and cooperation that an immediate price action will take effect, the same that happened to SHIBA (+44%) after their burn announcement. Yet, the most important thing that will happen is that it will allow our community to rest on their speculation and move forward with more important topics. For Gitcoin, the implications are that there is now expectation from the Gitcoin community toward the AKITA community. Holding 3% of our supply is roughly equivalent to what some of the big exchanges hold. We would be honored as a community if Gitcoin found the most efficient way of using this capital. 5. Benefits - The benefits of this proposal are many, #1 The AKITA community is able to get back to our original tokenomics. #2 The Gitcoin community is able to secure a source of long term funding. #3 The Gitcoin community is able to introduce themselves to a community of new and eager Ethereum users. #4 The AKITA community is able to be introduced to some of the greatest minds on Ethereum and what they are trying to build. #5 This social experiment plays out in a natural way that benefits both parties tremendously. #6 No unnecessary backlash for either party. 6. Drawbacks -  Drawbacks could include radical entities from either side not being satisfied with the decision and intentionally voicing this publicly. 7.  Vote- Clearly outline what voting \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d entails. **Voting Yes means that you are voting to agree with my proposal. ** A Yes vote means to agree with Gitcoin burning 45% of the tokens sent from Vitalik\u2019s wallet and splitting the remaining 5% with AKITA network\u2019s team, with 3% going to Gitcoin and 2% going to the AKITA dev team. Voting No means that you are voting against this proposal in favor of another proposal. ",

But why would they be dissatisfied? If you know their reasonings, they should be listed as drawbacks. One issue I have with this proposal, beyond the general burn (which itself has overarching moral considerations that arent being made), is that 2/5 of this is going to Akita. Every project is self-funded until they get funded. Thats the point of Gitcoin\u2019s matching. To provide funding where it proportionally should be (based on QF). It seems strange to insist these funds be burnt because \u201cspeculators made mistakes buying a token, we should try to help them by removing the funds from circulation\u201d, and then come around and say \u201cbut we deserve the funds\u201d. The two positions seem to oppose one another. (Paraphrasing obviously) ",

                    "content": "I think it might be a good idea to revisit the origin of all this and it all started with Vitalik sending Akita coins to Gitcoin. (And yes I am talking from an investor\u2019s perspective and yes i have read the whole discussion thread on this topic) and before this incident I have never heard about Gitcoin before. The question is should I as an investor? If yes, i apologize for my ignorance. Out of curiosity, I had a brief look at the quadratic funding schema, which is an interesting idea (  https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656 ), and the last sentence of the abstract is probably relevant: \u2026\u201cthis solution to the public goods problem may furnish neutral and non-authoritarian rules for society that nonetheless support collective organization\u201d but what is not clear is the form of contribution to fund public goods. So, does vitalik wanted to \u201ccontribute\u201d this token, so that Gitcoin sell it and conduct quadratic funding matching for funding? Then I would say, hmm okay, then I am not sure what \u201cneutral\u201d and \u201cnon-authoritarian\u201d rules is based on. You are also right in saying that it was purely speculative in nature to invest in something which started of as a meme with all this dog hype (and also sorry I am one of these ignorant investors). However, over time, the Akita team are eager to build something, going beyond of what it was, the narrative changed. And I trust them, all of them. Why not give them a chance to build something and proof themselves of what they want to achieve? I think every project deserves a chance to develop, build and gain trust as long as they do not scam or rugpull. Unfortunately, under the current circumstances, the future of the project is in Gitcoins\u2019 hand and the project itself depends on Gitcoin\u2019s decision. Sure, these days, the lifecycle of a project might be rather short and not long-lasting and noone knows what the future will bring. So everything is pure speculation in itself. However, I still believe in these guys. And let\u2019s think about the chain of events that is triggered if the \u201csale scheme\u201d you have mentioned in the other discussion thread is implemented. Will Gitcoin be happy over time to use \u201cthese funds\u201d (is this what Vitalik wanted?) for different public goods? Is this contribution morally, ethically and socially acceptable? If yes, well then I would think in several years later: \u201cAh yes, this was Gitcoin\u201d. 1) They are awesome or 2) They dumped a community\". it is just how people might remember. I am not saying you are doing something bad with this (if you believe this is the right way), it is just a decision that is easier to be made on Gitcoins site compared to the Akita\u2019s site. As such, i dont think it is a neutral one here because the source of contribution is based on a community project (Akita) and not solely by individuals (or \u201ccitizens\u201d as it is mentioned in the paper) that agree on the contribution (or Vitalik thought that it is okay like this but that would be a \u201cpowerful\u201d citizen :)). All in all, I think Relic\u2019s proposal is great.

They are fly by night pop ups that are just there with no intrinsic value. AKITA has proven through several downward spirals thsy the community cared about the project, not just the value. Of course there are moon bois and wen lambos but that is in every currency even the major players. Once this project is able to grab more traction, things are gonna blow up way beyond proportion. That 500m value at the time will pale in comparison over the course of the project. Even 3% has the possibility of becoming well more than 500m I\u2019m value, along with the token having more liquidity so you wouldn\u2019t lose 98% to slippage. This is the only logical reasoning that pander to both ethical sense as well as financial success. It\u2019s keep the Gitcoin community reputation and entire purpose in tact, while saving a growing community of 50k people who truly believe in the project. There had been virtually no advertising for this project and it is the 3rd largest meme currency based off market cap and volume. That is nuts. Thats like having Carl\u2019s crab shack on the corner being the 3rd largest crab retailer with no commercials or advertising. It\u2019s beyond impressive. All this had been created with no funding from the community. The devs never alloted team tokens. It was only meant to be an experiment that ended up turning into a full blown project. We are on the precipice of creativity. Let this one play out. ",

It is bad if that is the only priority considering there was a very large donation made specifically to fund open-source projects INCLUDING AKITA. Akita can access these funds already. It seems very, very strange to ignore this fact and insist that Gitcoin tie themselves to Akita. Akita can be a part of open-source development, but having Gitcoin depend on Akita\u2019s development makes really no sense. Further, if any of these community members believed in Akita, they would know that if the price goes lower, the coin surely has inherent value and they would buy more. If they don\u2019t think this is the case, they why are they in the Akita community? Surely there must be some fundamental value Akita and its dev\u2019s bring? Please. If I am uninformed on the utility Akita provides/can provide to Gitcoin, please inform me. If noone can inform me on any of this\u2026 It makes the Akita community look like a hollow cash-grab. Which of course makes this attempt to leech disproportionate funding seem even more distasteful. ",

And if Gitcoin thinks that\u2019s the best idea, go for it, but please don\u2019t leave a single Akita in your hands, I am not going a fucking to selling a single AKITA, waiting for your dump. But, If Gitcoin decide to collaborate with Akita community and grow together we can bring more energy that you can never handle it. ",

If Akita devs and investors really want Gitcoin to burn most of what it received and give 2/5 of what remains to the devs to create something of (so far) questionable utility to the open internet community, let them put some actual skin in the game in terms of:  Investors contributing a matching amount to the dev team and maybe even to Gitcoin. Dev team committing (ideally via a smart contract) to contribute to Gitcoin as Akita grows via specific milestones (could be in DAI or AKITA).  The current argument of \u201cyour small stake will grow a lot if we grow a lot\u201d is IMHO a bit weak from a project that started as a meme of a meme, is fueled largely by speculators with little interest in the open internet, and had a rug pull at that. Not that Gitcoin has to be the go-to moral authority in the space but one could easily see VB sending his AKITA to Gitcoin to sell off as quickly as possible and kill AKITA to send a message to all other get-rich-quick memecoins. Pretty much most if not all of us in DeFi and crypto in general have been burned. Yes, it sucks. And yet, it\u2019s made us stronger, smarter, and more discerning/knowledgable in the space. I\u2019d even argue that every rug pull and a meme coin that doesn\u2019t moon got me (and probably many others) to become more involved with the space as a contributor in other ways than money. So, in light of all that, I\u2019d put the onus on AKITA\u2019s devs and investors to prove their utility to Gitcoin and the open internet community, to make it 100% clear that \u201clook, we will actively support your mission with at least funds right now and into the future.\u201d ",

Positive sentiments rules the crypto space\u2026 The effect of  FUD cannot be overemphasised!!! AKITA perform greatly without listing on major exchanges and having some advancement projects underway. I tend to believe that with listings of AKITA on major platforms, completion and deployment of AKITA\u2019s advancements alongside an announcement and implementation of burning AKITA token (the 95%) will be immensely beneficial to both communities. Choosing, Announcing and taking action to actual sell some % of AKITA tokens by Gitcoin will further plummet the already plummeted  value of AKITA at the very least while it can eventually lead to the death of the social experiment envisaged by AKITA current developers and holders. Also, I also believe the sales of AKITA tokens shouldn\u2019t be announced to avoid AKITA price crash and to maximise the recovery of stable funds from its sales. ",

Why not put all the $AKITA to work on Based Loans? It\u2019s a Compound Finance fork, which was designed to target the Alt coin space for coins with high trading volume, high liquidity, and high number of holders. We decided to create markets for the highest traded dog coins on ETH main chain. Essentially the play is to Deposit $AKITA to based.loans to earn $BLO APY on $KISHU. This will reduce selling pressure and increase the price over time. P.S. The screenshot if from one of my personal wallets.
