In my humble opinion, being a delegate is simply about responsibility and leveraging aligned incentives.  Who am I? I\u2019ve been around the block in crypto at both centralized and decentralized companies/communities. I did some stuff and such for community development at the Foundation.  Delegation as Responsibility Applying as a delegate is a forcing function for me: become a better member of the community. In addition, delegation feeds into the two projects I\u2019m still working on, the revised and relaunched Maker badges and Maker Relay. We have plans to scale Maker Relay into something far more robust eventually. What form it takes is still up for exploring and questions. The Relay makes me a more informed voter, which is great. It\u2019s also an exciting thing to provide, working together for our numerous stakeholders. Completely revised Badges, of course, need no introduction but needless to say, they will be exciting.  Values Cautious optimism - I\u2019ve been reading about mindsets a lot recently and operate from this position: \u201cpessimism is easy, whereas optimism is hard.\u201d MakerDAO has already exercised extraordinary caution and restraint in a historical frothy space. I\u2019d vote to stay aligned with the mindset that brought us innovations like liquidations 2.0. Steady testing, reliable math, and thoughtful intention. When it works, then celebrate the process that got us there but still, always aware that there are looming threats to the protocol we need to be conscious of. Long term scalability The only thing that matters is that DAI is bulletproof for the long term. I see USDC as a current hairy problem that we\u2019ll find an elegant solution to. Then there will be another problem for us to handle. I think with each of these challenges we grow stronger as a community. Stealing a metaphor from Matt Rabinowitz here: I intend to vote for rates parameters and technical decisions that enable walking first and then running. Then, I dunno, like speedboating or something. Adaptability Conversely, if you blend my optimism and startup experience into a bit of a paradox, I do think there are nimble opportunities that pop up from time to time that are worth pursuing. I think staying adaptable to layups is key for the team.  Aligned incentives > conflict of interest Interestingly, I don\u2019t have any conflicts of interest; I align incentives instead. . I always try to keep any full-time employment: focused, relevant, and adjacent to Maker. This focuses my full attention on participating here while leveraging collaborative opportunities.  Possible conflict of interest? Payment It\u2019s worth stating that as a delegate, I won\u2019t be doing this all for free. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect a 10 hour minimum of weekly work to be an informed voter on behalf of others without some level of compensation. We haven\u2019t figured out the model for this quite yet, once we have the rough edges I will communicate what I think is the best approach. Keeper? Not sure if operating a keeper is a conflict of interest, but I do have some hope in getting the backstop keeper running on a computer at home. I will probably get sandwiched, but hey, one for the cause, am I right? I read and agree to follow the Delegate Code of Conduct.

I\u2019ll leave the bit about payments and keepers since that\u2019s more forum-appropriate. But I removed that blurb from the delegate profile since it seemed like clutter.  edit Q1 2022 Thanks to @flipflopflapdelegate will refer to FeeblackLoops as FBL for short.  Added an email from our custom domain. Cleaned up conflict of interest paragraph a bit. Changelog here  edit July 2022  added new delegate contract & profile links here on the forum and in github markdown.   edit Dec 2023  Added a fancy new disclaimer, if you\u2019re an MKR holder and want to be litigious; we\u2019ve got you covered.

Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, MKT-001 (MIP40c3-SP33) - October 11, 2021 Yes - but looking forward to clearer budgets in the future. Ratification Poll for Adding MakerLabs Core Unit (SNUNK-001) - October 11, 2021 Abstain - These cats are some of my favorite people abstained to not block things. Yet, EurDAI is way too big for an \u2018MVP\u2019 approach. There are other low-hanging fruits to jam on with the community and get out the door. If it ends up failing I\u2019m stoked to see revisions, if passes, hey that\u2019s dope too. Ratification Poll for Implementation of DSS Charter (MIP59) - October 11, 2021 Yes - Institutional access to Maker is, sadly, one of the key levers to growing supply. Once Nexo clarified how their positions would benefit the ecosystem writ large via their desk, they convinced me. ",

Highlights include changing ETH-B to be more cautious (as noted in this week\u2019s relay that risk premium is pretty high) and getting some fees out of the old USDC-A vault. Lower PSM Vault Fees - November 1, 2021 Yes. What matters more is that DAI is exchangeable one to one across as many venues of liquidity as possible, more than any fees we might generate or any vault friction it may produce. If we see that any single stablecoin starts to comprise an uncomfortable amount of DAI generated, well then \u2026.back the fees go. In addition, we\u2019ll have to be more creative around managing different fees on different PSMs. @PaperImperium s already polling for a stepwise reduction towards zero which I\u2019m uncertain is the best approach, but open to seeing how it goes. I am curious if this will fill up that quickly or the average PSM vault size. Community Greenlight Poll - MDI (MD Irradiance LLC) - November 1, 2021 - abstain. \u201c6s for late-stage solar\u201d sounds straightforward but losing a RWA committee member with expertise is a hefty price.

In order to onboard more delegates, this LLC recommends compensating them well. More long-term, happy to work with as many teams as possible to improve the delegation framework. We think we\u2019ve learned a lot in these past few months about how to make this process improve. NS-DROP Covenant Modification - November 8, 2021 Abstain - There\u2019s too much in flux with real world finance to adjust any covenants parameters or take on additional risk. Feedblack loops recommends getting the RWA & RWF houses into a more clear direction before revisions. That being said we think this is a blip and look forward to better-structured deals for RWA in general. GUNIV3DAIUSDC-A Parameter Adjustments - November 8, 2021 Yes - Already this vault has performed tremendously, every Relay we write on the rundown and it\u2019s shocking to see the hockey stick. Happy to endorse the vault\u2019s ceiling and parameter adjustments. Increase the WSTETH-A Debt Ceiling - November 8, 2021 Yes- The experiment here succeeded, following the SR from PE\u2019s recommendations it seems like a logical next step to increase wstETH. DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI Parameter Adjustments - November 8, 2021 Yes- It\u2019s essential that we keep building on the PE work by growing D3  exposure slowly \u201cto 20% of the Aave v2 DAI supply market.\u201d as per risk eval. Add WBTC-B as a new Vault Type - November 8, 2021 Yes- The WBTC market is only growing + Maker has a pretty close split with Aave and compound for WBTC share. Based on the velocity of new whales entering DeFi, it\u2019s good to have a choice for users looking to suck the marrow out of \u2026.whatever the heck you call this market RN Ratification Poll for Supplement to Collateral Onboarding Application (MIP6c3-SP1) - November 8, 2021 Yes- making MIP 6 more articulate for new RWA will help us catch inconsistencies earlier. Even though these are quite verbose to begin with IMHO. Ratification Poll for the Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) - November 8, 2021 Yes - An incentivized bug bounty program actively run? Yes please, we need more of that. Ratification Poll for Adding the Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit (DECO-001) - November 8, 2021 Yes - Deco unleashes far more potential than the concerns raised. To name a few positives: they unblock PE, help growth with a novel product, all access and controls are managed by maker governance, and open new markets for Maker. Sorry to be controversial. The other core units and OHM are still in review. ",

Add WBTC-C as a new Vault Type - November 22, 2021 Yes- As always, we\u2019re curious to see what happens when we tweak parameters and how vaults migrate. Hopefully, this helps us protect Maker in the event of a severe market unwind. If ETH and WBTC are the fastest-growing collaterals in DeFi it makes sense to acknowledge growing demand and give users an opportunity to engage with Maker Vaults while protecting downside risk. Increase the System Surplus Buffer - November 22, 2021 Yes and voted for: Increase to 90 million by 1 million per week. After re-reading the threads and checking the arguments for a linear increase it made more sense to focus on rounder numbers. We still maintain that a revised surplus buffer mechanism is the best approach for Maker long term, and with a couple of changes/ideas on the forums the solution for the community is around the corner. hopefully, someday, we inch towards something Iike this:    [Signal Request] Increasing the Surplus Buffer (2021-11)   like \u201cuse 25% of burning and put 75% into the System Surplus\u201d.   Add a GUSD Peg Stability Module - November 22, 2021 Yes- Though we have half the float for USDP, another PSM is just a signal of confidence. Gemini has been around forever, proven themselves to be reliable and high integrity. Its reminiscent of adding WBTC the first time, where Maker is the use case to prove out the infrastructure. Increase the Aave D3M Maximum Debt Ceiling - November 22, 2021 Yes- Huge congrats to getting this module delivered, the first DC seems to have functioned quite well. We\u2019re still not at the level that risk outlined we could reach with this module to keep the rates in the target. Cautiously optimistic to see this model expand to other lending markets over time and survive some market wobbles. ",

It\u2019s also a great use of Seb\u2019s talents, working on higher-level finance was something we suggested on a community call a year ago. Nice to see it happen. Can\u2019t wait for the first strategic focus call. Ratification Poll for Collateral Offboarding Process (MIP62) Yes- @GFXlabs did great here outlining a much-improved process to refer to, link out, and communicate across the community when collaterals are getting removed. Ratification Poll for Core Unit Budget, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP47)  Yes - The DAO-to-DAO splitting of cost here is the best part of this core unit. Layer 2\u2019s are the future and the wormhole needs Starknet. Ratification Poll for Bug Bounty Program for MakerDAO Critical Infrastructure (MIP64)  Yes - Now that immunifi is here, it\u2019s time to flex some muscle on the bug bounties and protect our users. One highlight here is the robustness of in-scope & out-of-scope parts of the proposal. Ratification Poll for Maker Keeper Network (MIP63) Yes - Plus one to keeper improvements, saving everyone gas by having an option to work together in a unified way that\u2019s still permission-less is clutch. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding for RWF-001 (MIP41c4-SP27) Yes - The business continuity here was not the best, but glad we have the opportunity to onboard Will onto this team. HIs expertise is needed. Ratification Poll for Development & UX Core Unit Budget - DUX-001 (MIP40c3-SP52) Yes - The value this team provides for the expense is in multiples. Exciting to see the changes in personnel coming down the pipe so there is more momentum on voting experiments. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES-001) (MIP40c3-SP55)  Yes - No surprises here that keeping SES funded and healthy is helping the DAO writ large. Community Greenlight Poll - TUSD-PSM (TrueUSD)  Yes (Greenlight ) - FLLLC is Generally in favor of PSM diversity. There was a time where TUSD was celebrating 100 million as a milestone, it\u2019s nice to see that it\u2019s grown enough to do millions in volume. Prioritize Onboarding a Compound DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M)  Yes - This module has proven itself well on Aave to it\u2019s only logical to extend to compound to stabilize the rates in DeFi a bit more. Prioritize DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) for Maple Finance Yes - Controversial, but this gives us a chance to put D3M in the hands of more protocols, control it if things seem to go south, and work with a team that executes with institutional clients. A win/win/win to quote Michael Scott. There are concerns though about who gets hit first in a shortfall, so hopefully before we crank this up these are addressed. Increase the Dust Parameter for Select LP Token Vaults - January 10, 2022 Yes- Analysis here was thorough and clear, thanks for the reading @monet-supply! Wish we had this split up so the forums votes FLLLC posted would match, but for the sake of Governance overhead, it\u2019s fine. **Proposal - Recover DAI Locked in Optimism Escrow  Yes - We\u2019ve had many debates about helping users in the past, this thread is doing a good job of discussing some general best practices. Utilizing a signed transaction seems like a happy medium. In addition, because we\u2019re just recovering funds instead of something else this is a positive for the community.  Abstain   **Raise the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) Threshold  Abstain - If we are worried about single actors this mitigates that, so\u2026 sure. There is a greater concern about rallying enough support to trigger ESM if we actually need it, and there isn\u2019t enough time to track down where all the MKR sits or if the community has a deep enough relationship with that holder. Somewhat recalling drunk whale moments from this. Hoping for the best if it passes though, cautious optimism. **Community Greenlight Poll - OGN (Origin Protocol)  & **Community Greenlight Poll - OUSD (Origin Dollar)  Abstain- Conflict of interest here preventing objective voting on both collaterals. That being said it\u2019s encouraging to see the team\u2019s commitment to helping make the collateral type profitable and commitment to growing the market for OUSD. Slightly worried that some of OUSD are backed by DAI, but I think an evaluation about leverage, via risk, would illuminate that concern more with data. Community Greenlight Poll - RBLD (Robinland Holdings)  Abstain - Not enough information to have an opinion one way or another. Just haven\u2019t had the time to review this application in depth. Good thing there is time to revisit. **Ratification Poll for Offboarding Content Production Core Unit (MKT-001)  Abstain- FLLLC is keeping conflict of interests low again, which seems to be the theme of this polling cycle. Since I personally work cross-functionally with this team in an individual contributor capacity every week it seems only right to abstain. That being said I commented on that thread about how content has been handicapped by our community and should push come to shove this vote will go no. **Ratification Poll for Onboarding Tech-Ops Core Unit (TECH-001)  Abstain - I\u2019ve personally worked with this team through the foundation and watching them mature / convert to a core unit is going to be great for the community. Keeping conflict of interest low here, unless the votes are needed to verify the team.  No   **Community Greenlight Poll - USDap (BondAppetit) No (Defer) - Too small to be profitable and extra RWA asset risk that hasn\u2019t been qualified. ",

Changing off-boarding vote Something has felt off, been wrestling with this decision & outcomes all weekend. Every time we opened the voting portal to vote on the exec and play gas-wars, that polling vote for MKT-001 screams out as a poor precedent to set. So, F3LC is flipping from \u2018abstaining\u2019 to \u2018no.\u2019 Why? This off-boarding has highlighted a gap in Core Unit governance and exploited it. A lack of subjective process, with a clear gap in what comes next, sticks out as most problematic. The additional work and stress on gov-alpha, gov-comms, and the tech ops teams waste time and effort. Regardless of the outcome, standing up for doing better DAO-wide is worth the gas.  Accountability DAO-Wide We all need to do better on accountability. It should be the standard, not a vague call where no one takes responsibility. The DAO needs to be more scrutinous upfront of CU\u2019s, and CU\u2019s need to push for excellence & transparency. I think @juan said it best on a GnR call \u201cdo good, consistent work, and show up, don\u2019t over-ask.\u201d So, on that note, will be pushing for accountability in these ways:  Working with a few other cross-functional folks to revise our off-boarding MIPs so this is clearer for everyone. (MIP inbound thanks to @paperimperium ) Hopefully, assisting @Aes and their team to make sure KPIs and better reporting become obvious, summarized, and clear across the community. Also, I\u2019ve personally been trying to offer perspective to the team on the public chopping block. This whole situation could be an opportunity to rise to the occasion (for what it\u2019s worth, I think all the responses in RFC did highlight room for improvement, though mostly vague). This as an opportunity to grow, set S.M.A.R.T. KPIs, and as @MadShills noted here in a months time:     MIP41c5-SP3: Facilitator Offboarding (MKT-001)    By Feb 2022, content production either has the capabilities to produce a strategy and clear KPIs, or not. If they are able to produce the KPIs and strategy, they can make their case for funding to execute on them in Q2 2022. If not, they were well paid the entire time for their work, no hard feelings and everyone has been treated fairly with no surprises. If content production is funded through Q2 2022, prior to the approval of a Q3 2022 budget there would be appropriate measures to evaluate performance, which remedies the current unfortunate situation.    Or not, we\u2019ll see how the vote goes and move on from there. Together. Onwards and upwards Maker community. LFG  ",

That was an intense Friday, let\u2019s not do that again. The poll does have wording trouble, so we\u2019ll see what the proper next steps are. ",

Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding to DUX-001 - 0xdeniz (MIP41c4-SP32) - February 14, 2022 Yes- @0xdeniz  has shown the DAO how to be proactive and ahead of the curve as a Pm and community member. Looking forward to his transition to facilitator which seems to be a natural fit. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, RISK-001 (MIP40c3-SP56) - February 14, 2022 Yes - Products are great and analysis continues to be the lynchpin of or community. @makerburn  joins the fam, blockanalytica keeps slaying, excited to see the next steps for the risk team. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Collateral Engineering Services, CES-001 (MIP40c3-SP57) - February 14, 2022 Yes - The CML and addition of @lollike have been big moves for CES. Awaiting the collateral priority sheet with feverish excitement. We have a backlog of teams to get too and fingers crossed that revision ships before there\u2019s 100 assets to onboard in the list.  Increase the PSM-GUSD Debt Ceiling - February 14, 2022 Yes - F3LC is generally in favor of PSM diversity and this isn\u2019t even close to 50% of supply. Risk\u2019s guidance is to not go above 50%. Ratification Poll for MIP55 Amendments (MIP4c2-SP16) - February 14, 2022 Yes - Nice to have clarity improvements that allow for quick SPF\u2019s. Simple revisions to make. As a community we should be utilizing these more. Staring in the mirror on that comment. Ratification Poll for Onboard/Amend Keeper Network - Tech-Ops (MIP63c4-SP1) - February 14, 2022 Yes - Tech ops were unsung heroes before for all things infrastructure so their addition to the network should help protect Maker in the inevitable craziness that ensues. Ratification Poll for Onboarding the Maker Talent Core Unit (MT-001) - February 14, 2022 Yes - Starting out more traditionally hopefully yield results. @manomad has been a patient facilitator-in-waiting already with the RFC period and has already brought value to some CU\u2019s. Looking forward to some of the heavier work in talent management. Will definitely be watching this team execute and providing feedback to make sure Maker attracts fantastic people. Wen postings on daily ape HR? Ratification Poll for Intangible Asset Assignment (MIP60) - February 14, 2022 Yes- Long overdue but now we have recourse for the community and future CU\u2019s to work with the foundation to steward assets from the Foundation days into the future of the DAO. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, Immunefi Security (IS-001) (MIP40c3-SP58) - February 14, 2022 Yes - Immunifi is popping up everywhere these days on the twitter\u2019s\u2026 so some part of the algo is working. After some delays due to the processing of registration, will be nice to get the frontloading disbursed and the unit operational.  FWIW it took me way too long to due diligence a lot of these budgets, will be thinking about how to make them clearer and simpler in the coming weeks. Also missed @TravinImmunefi updates due to personal circumstances changing quite a bit in the last month. ",

Continuing the process for offboarding TUSD.  Abstain Reinstate surplus buffer LERP Tl; Dr Currently, in a paradox opinion-state, it\u2019s better to abstain. It is possible to be both simultaneously in favor of a larger buffer to fuel growth and somewhat displeased we\u2019re making what, superficially, seems like reactive decisions. It\u2019s fine going with governance in this case whichever way it lands.  Longer opinion on the burn and some next steps It\u2019s been three weeks since the last post on bringing back the burn. Sure feels like a lifetime. After looking at numerous inputs it\u2019s clear that we should be adaptable; from supply flattening out into a choppy market (at best), centralization of borrowers, this report of the actual expenses, and a pipeline of available teams; our costs are increasing but profits aren\u2019t scaling to match. With the limiter in place, we can deal with existential protocol threats but a looming crash would still put the entirety of the DAO at risk. The 3% target recommended by risk is ~90MM, but is that really enough? An attempt at profits when the market is whipsawing isn\u2019t going to end well. Even for more medium term bulls on MKR. Overall, strategically evaluating the buffer & burn is a desperate need. F3LC is very in favor of a new system managing P&L writ large. On that topic, we remain cautiously optimistic since there are numerous ideas that will hopefully coalesce soon  . Speaking of momentum, working on a research SPF about the burn\u2019s performance and providing modeling for the DAO. The idea is: paying researchers from a neutral third party would set us up for objective evaluations of this mechanic. So we can, once and for all, stop cycling and strategically move forward; it feels like we\u2019re playing the same song over and over again.

The quality of these folks is unmistakable, and frankly, as someone who has booked events, set their budgets, worked them as an AV tech, etc., this SPF is a pretty decent cost/benefit. Most attendees remember events and 1:1 connections more than anything else; unless they are speakers or winning awards. Still muddling on the Core Unit. Initial Parameters for StarkNet Simple DAI Bridge - March 28, 2022  Yes - Low limit bridge to a cutting edge Rollup. Ship it. Short Ratification Poll for MIP62 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP2) - March 28, 2022  Yes - More Offboarding complications, sigh.

So\u2026. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af FWIW sounds like abstain. The actual decision point for Notional is risk calculus, comparing it to compound D3M out in the wild. Best for risk to sound off than handwave; we lack the staff at F3LC to handle that much modeling. The entire thread was an excellent sounding call towards reducing some friction points:  More clarity all around; on signaling, in COB, in D3M specifics, in prioritization \u2026 Teams should bring deals to Maker, ideally with significant upside. Delegates can help sure, even source opportunities but the team should probably own the MIP or signal(s). Even if meaning well and abstaining, having delegates steer the short-term roadmap seems like a complex headache for everyone. Unless a core unit\u2019s bandwidth is constrained and we can be helpful! As a community, we try to assume good faith, and it looks like we somewhat forgot. Be like bob ross   ",

Ratification Poll for Update Data Insights Core Unit Mandate (MIP39c2-SP31) - April 11, 2022 YES - In conjunction with a budget increase more clarity on the DIN unit\u2019s approach to data requests and products it serves is important. Adjust CRVV1ETHSTETH-A System Parameters - April 11, 2022 YES - stETH keeps growing so meeting this demand head-on is an underrated and smart strategy. Let\u2019s keep scaling these types of vaults but after yesterday, keep them safe. Ratification Poll for Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - April 11, 2022 YES - This one was hard, as I slightly prefer per event budgeting (which is really not good at all). Took a few trips down memory lane and recalled how much work every event is + how little appreciation a team gets for that. We know that these two focusing full time is going to provide high quality presence at larger conferences. FBL will provide support from war stories producing and participating at events so we can leverage exposure Maker gains. More generally trying to go for emails is a diminishing return, but tying events to partnerships, onsite surveys, even tweet impressions (sigh) are all angles to experiment with. We could do crypto native things too like POAPs or special swag. Ratification Poll for Modify the Collateral Application Form (MIP6c3-SP2) - April 11, 2022 YES - Hooray for clarity. The bucketing of questions helps a lot and gives a more stable foundation for more complicated collateral in the future. Ratification Poll for Adding CES-001 as a Collateral Onboarding Domain Team - April 11, 2022 YES - This team ships with craft, it\u2019s super rare to find that. Already not messing around with responses to long-forgotten collateral apps @monkeyirish. Good to see us moving methodically to unblocking the collateral list. The soc-gen intergration work is also a fantastic win for the community, excited to see that get across the finish line. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP63) - April 11, 2022 ABSTAIN - Conflict of interest because of working on state of DAI every week. That being said, FBL is advocating for more resources to improve Maker\u2019s image. It seems like this additional hire would also pair exceptionally well with growth\u2019s plan for an incubating brand team. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP62) - April 11, 2022 ABSTAIN - Conflict of interest because of working on state of DAI every week. Ratification Poll for Add Data Insights Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP64) - April 11, 2022 YES - This team over-delivers for the money. Check their discord and replies on the budgeting thread. I\u2019m not sure why we\u2019d handicap all their CU counterparts\u2019 access to necessary dashboards and exports. In addition, they\u2019re planning to return funds to the protocol. (edit)* Ratification Poll for Modify Protocol Engineering Core Unit Budget, PE-001 (MIP40c3-SP68) - April 11, 2022 YES - Can\u2019t have a protocol without the team that maintains and expands it. Brian\u2019s reasoning in Discord was also helpful. Ratification Poll for Dissolution of Content Production, MKT-001, Multi-Sig Request (MIP47c3-SP1) - April 11, 2022 YES - More offboarding votes, sigh. Ratification Poll for Governance Communications Core Unit, COM-001, Mandate Refresh (MIP39c2-SP30) - April 11, 2022 YES - Lots of clarity in this revision. In general, as budgets become more standardized I think increases will be easier to stomach if we get them set against a backdrop of returns on operational efficiency or actual revenue. Plugging another push for MIP40 revisions. ",

Add wstETH-B as a new Vault Type - April 25, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Make stake retail again, staying competitive and not egregiously expensive is a plus\u2026 New vault types are almost always helpful.  After watching ETH-C take off this gives Maker an edge to absorb more capital. Extend Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Budget Until May Governance Cycle - April 25, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: Personal bias is best avoided, FBL is neither opposed nor supportive of this proposal.

There are concerns but upon investigation, we should uncover them. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - May 2, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: At first glance, it looks like the DAO is giving up revenue to chase the market. After going back and running the numbers on vault openings last month, this methodology doesn\u2019t seem to stimulate minting.  But We, as a DAO, both don\u2019t have direct communications with significant vault holders ( or possible ones) and FBL doesn\u2019t have per address breakdowns of users migrating WBTC positions between platforms. Would want to dive in further with the data to suggest solutions, and FBL failed to follow up on those threads. Thus voting abstain. It\u2019s worth noting that in the past month:  we shrunk WBTC-A rate and there are less vaults, week on week and as a total. we shrunk WBTC-B rate and that broke even on vaults opened/closed. reduction in stETH and that added vaults but it\u2019s unclear if that\u2019s due to rate adjustments? And the open debt stayed the same.  ",

We need to slowly, and steadily, build towards taking on and managing this risk. It seems finally aligned with Maker first, which is the main deal starter we should all be looking for as more of these come online. The managers that Monetalis approached are world class and the revisions are more in line with putting assets to work. That, and more reproducible deal structures. The other side of this vote is simple: if we\u2019re really thinking of yeeting half a billion dollars out all in one go, that seems quite unwise. From the reading of Tolstoy\u2019s word count here it seems that there are gates and checks to get towards managing that total DC.

Since the macro-environment is continuing to be painful,  if we time this right, strategic careful investment in ETH is not only going to be cheap but help diversify the balance sheet.

This investigation is a step in that direction. Launch Maker Teleport with 1 Basis Point Fee - May 23, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Following the vote on the forum poll, yes to launching with a small fee.

The first thing is: that once collateral gets greenlit, there is little chance to say no, other than one recommendation to keep the debt ceiling low. \u201cIt\u2019s only a green light\u201d is incomplete reasoning on my part. Once the foot is in, the pressure is on the CU\u2019s to make deals happen. Which we have to fix as a community. Teams need to be able to say no, both faster and sooner. The second thing is research: after digging a little deeper into some debates on discord, listening to stakeholders, and too much reading (on the weekend, no less), this vault allows FEI to grow with a discount line of credit where we take on multiple risks. 2.5 on 100 Mil doesn\u2019t seem like the fairest shake. There has to be a better deal putting Maker first and having a fair cost to FEI. We are both stablecoins, after all. With all the code coming out of that team and the competence of its DAO leaders, I\u2019m sure there are some creative win/wins. It seems like the energy exists across multiple teams to make a deal. Let\u2019s do that. FEI should utilize Maker, Maker should help teams expand when deals are win/win, but they might as well use their collateral that backs FEI, which is ETH, which we have vaults for. Other teams that build do this already. Or ship the draft code for 4626 as Ilk types. Or negotiate for an institutional vault down the line and a couple of milestones to get there. Plenty of options, it seems. ",

Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: No then Yes Reasoning: :cracks-knuckles We have been thinking through this burn vote so much that we didn\u2019t even post the vote and comment on the OG thread due to waffling. Sigh. On the one hand, the most valuable thing about the burn is sending a commitment to our community of MKR holders. Three reasons why:  if we\u2019re going to start moving into a new paradigm of more involved governance and more involved MKR holders, showing them that we still care about the value of MKR, both intangible and intrinsic, is probably essential. deploying Dss kiln in the wild it\u2019s going to be a handy tool, and we\u2019re going to need it. MKR is cheap now, which is good timing.  Then there is the other side,  common sense:  burning is a bad look optically. As a regular vault holder who might have gotten liquidated, that sends a message that\u2019s\u2026 not great. second, we\u2019ve been dishonest with ourselves that the burn doesn\u2019t function as we want it to.  Then there\u2019s the ancillary reasoning too, which is that loosely spending money just because we\u2019re lucky to have funds on something that the DAO isn\u2019t aligned around, is chaotic and kind of foolish. Reasoning like, \u201coh, we have this extra money from liquidations. We might as well spend it on this burn experiment.\u201d That\u2019s\u2026flawed logic. Taking the pros/cons into account is plus 3 \u201cfor the burn\u201d plus 2 for \u201cnot burn,\u201d and the wild card is that we\u2019re making a poorly reasoned decision due to liquidations makes it an experiment that\u2019s covered (  no idea how to score that). Based on those reasons, FBL values of community, and embracing this paradox, we should do this with a caveat. ** Immediately after this vote,  writing begins a MIPS 13 For declaration of intent.  Here are the broad strokes: \u201cShould the burn underperform on its 3-month target (measured as an expected price increase of some percent from burn date), The DAO will not take any action on burning for over a year.\u201d Just a one-year DOI, simple & straightforward. If anybody wants to collaborate on this MIP, more than welcome. It seems like every month, the burn comes up, wastes energy and time, and distracts necessary community bandwidth & resources that need an allocation to worthier endeavors. The mechanic is primitive, and there is a screaming pile of data that MKR trades on Macro. Full stop. It\u2019s an ERC-20 token; we\u2019re not special. Yet. Here\u2019s to seeing that thesis proved wrong in the wild, instead of debating endlessly from uninformed market data and reading tea leaves. ",

Voted: Abstain Reasoning: This idea of cross functional initiatives beyond single mandates are quite powerful. Abstaining for now since the overwhelming majority dwarfs any vote FBL can contribute. The language here might need revision and another try. Some of the proposed initiatives lack cross-DAO prioritization or input which might explain the current consensus. However, the collaborative spirit is here. We need to coordinate around making faster decisions and with the next iteration we\u2019d love to see a focus on concrete impact/deliverables/value-add. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Growth Core Unit Budget, GRO-001 (MIP40c3-SP70) - June 13, 2022 Voted: 1. Approve increased budget (bear) 2. Approve increased budget (Base) Reasoning: What we\u2019ve seen so far this year has been highly encouraging. The DAO must collectively acknowledge that it\u2019s about to be rough, so lighting money on fire to try and grow is not the best strategy. But continuing humble growth of programs that get Maker\u2019s brand out there, in addition to all the work this team does, that is a decent compromise. Pull up the bootstraps and crush.

Approve without delegated authority to spend funds Reasoning: We don\u2019t share the community rancor, but trying to grow Maker is why we\u2019re all here. This MIP: lacked broad enough consensus and jumped into governance cycle a bit early with a big ask. A couple AMA\u2019s, some more inclusive meetings, a few pitch decks, and some clarity might be the way but at the moment this needs a focus on what exactly the DAO gets with the spend. Ratification Poll for Adding Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001) - June 13, 2022 Voted: No Reasoning: Luca is a fantastic contributor, highly experienced, and a value add for the DAO. His assessments have always been helpful, and we\u2019re lucky to have him here. But as is, this CU lacks concrete deliverables beyond the first three months, and since RWF hasn\u2019t shipped it\u2019s larger deals, this CU seems premature. Should we be working with Luca? Yes, we\u2019re absolutely blessed to have his focus! Extra reviewing eyes will 100% be necessary, but in the next few months, no probably not. This seems like a team we need in a year, not right now. We can\u2019t justify another million-dollar spend without clear goals or timelines. For full transparency, should this vote fail and this team tighten up to apply again, FBL is happy to evaluate out of the formalized MIP40 budget windows. Makershire Poll JUN 13 2022 Voted: Yes Reasoning: Like Makerman, FBL has long supported a more active balance sheet management and gaining return on idle assets. There are a few worrying parts to this proposal, but it\u2019s structured in a way that the downside for SF is far higher than the returns to the DAO. It\u2019s thankless work to help us stay afloat without burning the house down. We need a team focused on increasing liquidity and taking advantage of simple yield.

August 03, 2022  PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - August 1, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This PPG implementation seems like a watershed moment, removal of cefi lenders from the calculations, rough conditions in lending markets, and forward guidance.

Tactical Re-allocation Process for Budget Adjustments - August 1, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Bottoms up KPI\u2019s are going to be an interesting experiment and lead the DAO towards more alignment/accountability. Will it be perfect? No. Will be advocating for aggregation at a project level. Hopefully this spurns discussions/frameworks for a general strategic direction, expectations about \u201cby when,\u201d and measured \u201cby how.\u201d But the SF team is serving for aggregation, and this should be a useful exercise.

On top of that, the yield (2%) over the WAL of 6 years is flatly, not great. Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments (MIP4c2-SP15) - August 8, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: Abstaining, due to stewarding/authoring the proposal.

Ratification Poll for Makershire Redux (MIP76) - August 8, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Great to see so proposals take revisions and try again. Stable pools are a much better source of bootstrapping liquidity and DAI needs exposure on Arbitrum etc. On top of that the yield on those pools is, surprisingly, performant. Ratification Poll for Offboarding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - August 8, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: All of the current offboardings both don\u2019t follow the MIP4 revisions, which is not great, and if executed, paint the DAO as an unreliable partner. If there is a convincing argument based on actual performance against mandates that would be reasonable. But as is, this tool is a big hammer to break out instead of simply talking to the CU. There is most definitely an environment refocusing mandates on what\u2019s best for the DAO that doesn\u2019t involve threatening an offboarding. Plus, events lowered their budget and took feedback from an increasingly hostile environment. ",

Plus, there is no Junior capital. To be clear, would love to see a mining operation up and running, verifiable proof of renewables, and an actual need for a line of credit. This proposal would be more interesting evaluating against scaling up an operation considerably, or covering some sort of call option on Bitcoin.

Community Greenlight Poll - DDC (Detox Digital Coin) - August 15, 2022 (thread) Voted: No (Defer) Reasoning: This is fundraising, which Maker can\u2019t do and probably shouldn\u2019t without a far more sophisticated/holistic way to evaluate something like this. Target Spend Level - August 22, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: 15 million DAI 2nd choice: 16 million DAI Reasoning: The work that went into framing rNPI and spend levels is quite thorough, at least there is some consensus here; looking forward to the next steps. With so many spinning plates, allocating our energy towards stronger/leaner outcomes will be more important as these six months progress. Collateral Onboarding Project-based Funding Request (PFR) - August 22, 2022 (thread) Voted: **Yes Reasoning: With multiple SRs, approving the next steps on work-in-progress was complicated but it seems like this allots funds transparently to prioritize these pieces of RWA work.

But looking at overall lending demand in the space it actually seemed like Maker was somewhat steep. Incentivizing ETH across the board heading into the merge is a smart move to gain liquidity.

Stoked to see more legal eagles on the case in the DAO. These changes seem important to unblock HVbank and kudos to everyone for taking the safer/conservative approach. MKR Pro-Rata Vesting for former RWF-001 Members - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: As stated on the forum, the best approach would be resetting vesting on continuing work- or shipping a premier deal the team was focused on. Since that is overshadowed by current events and this vote doesn\u2019t fit that scenario, will abstain. Short Ratification Poll for MIP65 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP4) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: The language in the MIP is vague, and opens up potential future problems down the road. But since it\u2019s basically pointing to the lawyer who has been working MIP65 the entire time, no reason to hold this up at the moment. Highly, highly suggest forming a committee of legal experts to revise this MIP should it need generalizing. Bus factors exist.   @0xbocaJ @Matt_NZ and the inimitable @ACREinvest come to mind. Short Ratification Poll for Legal Work on MIP65 Special Purpose Fund (MIP55c3-SP8) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Reimbursing a bias for action.  Community Greenlight Poll - GNO (GnosisDAO) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: Abstaining for now to go do some liquidity research. Opening up to 30 million on the vault is a strong positive & offer, in addition to the professionalism, and the thoroughness. Plus xDAI continues to host some of the most interesting DAO experiments (DAUHaus comes to mind); and DAI is in the name. Community Greenlight Poll - GAMMA UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC (Gamma Uniswap v3 wBTC-renBTC) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: No (Defer) Reasoning: In general, diversification at Maker is usually good. The underlying asset exposure here just seems like we\u2019d be exposing Maker to more risk than it needs. Would like to see a different, more liquid, less risky pairing. Bridged assets plus centralized redemption is two factors that double the risk not reduce it. Community Greenlight Poll - GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI (Gelato Uniswap v3 BUSD-DAI) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: Abstaining on this for now.

Yeah we were thinking initially that WBTC-renBTC would be good collateral mainly due to the fact that both were already approved collateral types and despite WBTC having a centralized redemption, renBTC has permissionless redemption and WBTC has no blacklist function.  However, I totally get given the climate that any centralized functions would not be desirable. Our main goal was really to have our contracts go thru Maker\u2019s due diligence process.  We\u2019re very confident in the safety and durability of our contracts after having gone thru numerous audits with the latest being a 4-week audit with ConsenSys Diligence. Would love to connect with you on potential asset pairings for a future collateral application.  The ones we have in mind are rETH-wstETH or LUSD-DAI.  Happy to get your opinion here. Thanks again for the feedback! ",

It would just be another chain in the multichain roadmap. There are several issues with this proposal, so, spent quite a bit of time oscillating on the vote, hence the last minute ballot. Some of the mulling questions:  Declaring the cliff vested at the same time as implementing the compensation details is wonky. Should be separated out into retroactive and moving forward IMO. No disrespect intended, but just pointing out, comp at PECU + multiplier seems ok at the surface. but also it\u2019s more like a focused workstream.  Multiple would be more like 1.25 maybe? Dunno, not sure. One rollup with low TVL and a struggling ecosystem because Cairo is a PITA. Worry about the meaningful scale here, but too early to judge.

                    "content": " Ratification Poll for Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning:  Ahhh Endgame  After months of Endgame DVC\u2019s, individual consultations with facilitators, office hours attendance, and lots of reading on Endgame, we are pretty sure the status quo only has about 10% likelihood to last more than a few years. Whereas working towards Endgame, Maker\u2019s longevity chances increase to 30%. With our research, we concur with LFW and a16z that the ideal path is a phased rollout with a focused working group. Plenty of operational changes would help; counterintuitively those improvements & implementations are on everyone who wants to contribute. As the voting officer at FBL, a vote for Endgame for me personally is recognition. I am 90% sure that our current CU model will not succeed. The incentives from the get-go were poorly designed, primarily by happenstance. Yet! There is still so much talent, so much skill, and so much experience inside of makerDAO\u2019s current workforce that restructuring can deliver positive results. A radical one may not be entirely necessary, and realistically, it\u2019s a year of work and focus (maybe two). There can be an extended discussion about how most of the issues today stem from the foundation, both haplessly and practically, ill equipping this community with adequate tooling. Yet, we have delivered experiments in the real world; we have a handful of incredible partners competing for idle assets; we have retained the best risk team in the business. Protocol engineering is incredible, and their dedication continues even though they should have long since quit when the community took a negative turn. Govalpha shows up to do hybrid work on the cutting edge of innovation and rage. We could keep going 19 more times, but to all the CUs making this framework function, it is incredible how well it has functioned. The loyalty here is unimaginable, especially for a crypto protocol, an industry where talent comes and goes weekly. An additional thanks to the attendees of my RFC calls for their openness and for sharing their unique perspectives. A glimpse into the lives of the people who work this protocol daily and the facilitators who manage them brought clarity to this vote\u2026 Endgame will iterate dozens of times, so we at FBL are here to roll up our sleeves and get s*** done. This vote is a commitment to the people who are here. And it is a matching of skills, eloquence, elegance, and excellence. Let us be excellent: excellent to each other and excellent to our legacy of work. ",

Tightening bootstraps is in general a good idea, so, happy to see continuation. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit DAI Budget, SAS-001 (MIP40c3-SP85) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve new bear budget Reasoning: Budget constraints are in general good, but will highlight that this is one of the only CU\u2019s that fulfilled their entire roadmap.

Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Redwood Friesian (MIP88) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: As we noted in the last series of votes: one Monetalis deal is enough.

Add GNO (GnosisDAO) as a new Vault Type - November 21, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: There are valid liquidity concerns and parameters to monitor with GNO coming aboard. At first glance it seems like it may be unproductive. But the good faith of the proposal combined with the on chain execution behind this DAO indicates worthy potential. Add Multiple BlockTower Credit Vault Types (RWA010, RWA011, RWA012, RWA013) - November 21, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: Generally onboard with both diversifying exposure on the Real world side and Blocktower as a counterparty. However, 4 vaults of medium (\u201c\u201d) risk don\u2019t seem exactly linear in overall risk portfolio. There are a handful of gaps or unclear expectations in monitoring and management of downside here. Looking to other experts for sign-off and pushback if necessary. Moving forward, onchain assets for any RWA are table stakes. Offboarding Parameters for renBTC-A - November 21, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Contagion controls continue. Full support.

Ratification Poll for Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Facilitator Onboarding (MIP41c4-SP38) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: Originally, abstained on this first version of this poll. Now that a little more data is in the open it seems like a second facilitator isn\u2019t necessary. Ratification Poll for CoinShares Active Treasury Management (MIP86) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: Since governance has voted on excess USDC then available, going to just say no to proposals of this type moving forward until the house gets in order.  Coinshares had many incongruencies up front but did a decent job of articulating confusing portions of their proposal. Optimistic for a revision / different approach. Ratification Poll for OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: Origin team has shown lots of resilience but this MIP got rushed into a vote before answering existential risks. In addition it has the same problem: asking for excess USDC then available. Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Mandate (MIP39c2-SP38) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: Can\u2019t really decide, abstain. On the one hand, not sure if we need this unit at the moment. Reading through past reports and updates, a majority of the time seems like negotiating with whitehats about bug escalation/categorization (though the one critical bug blog post was a nice read). Instead of finding attack surfaces and trying to source the biggest threats, ISCU been caught on programs that are more obligations than leverage for the DAO. On the other hand, you definitely want a bug program focusing on the right outcomes and incentivizing white hats. If this doesn\u2019t pass there is probably an opportunity to consolidate and reallocate focus/learnings towards whitehat incentives. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security (IS-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP83) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve reduced budget - BearMarket 2nd choice: Reject budget Reasoning: Though we can\u2019t support the updated mandate without revisions, a bear market push to allocate resources towards stronger impact is a worthy approach, voting reduce or reject. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Governance Communications Core Unit DAI Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP84) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: We\u2019ve abstained on most gov-comms votes to date, will continue that pattern. If this vote continues it\u2019s momentum, quite confident this team can slot into another CU or re-org and start showing the community how external actors set an example. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget, TECH-001 (MIP40c3-SP86) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Reject Budget Reasoning: Generally find tech-ops both open and helpful. That being said, nothing personal but worth flagging: there are a few pieces of this budget that need transparency/revision; we don\u2019t have a veto option so, voting no. \u201cRecruiting\u201d is vague (are those hiring bonuses or actual people? ), travel is basically 7 conferences a year for everyone (?), and there isn\u2019t a bear base on the budget, so it\u2019s not following the new MIP40 standard etc. Ratification Poll for Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit (MIP84c10-SP1) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: The thing isn\u2019t spec-ed, implemented, or deployed but we\u2019re tuning the parameters? Definitely understand the urgency and statement behind the MIP but even if this did pass, there would just be another one to change the parameters in the future.  DAI Savings Rate Adjustment - November 28, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Leave the DSR unchanged at 0.01% Reasoning: General shout out to everyone on the thread for being clear and not going off the rails this time. The discussion around raising the rate has been a good example of how Governance approached ideas in the past.  That being said it seems like more fine-tuning and understanding the use case for this is warranted. Voting to keep it the same for now, but open to debating the full route for users and protocols in the future. There is a time to deploy the DSR, it seems like that time isn\u2019t now. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - November 28, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Onboard with these changes, well reasoned. Opening up to more stETH and fine tuning the tins on other PSMs is good to see, plus a call to safety on compound D3M. Undertake Necessary Risk and Legal Assessments to Increase the NS-DROP Debt Ceiling to 50 Million DAI - November 28, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning:  Have we ever said no to voluntarily increasing fees?

As big as this spell was, which is a coordination achievement, there are things in there that are not in line with FBL polling votes and we need to start unbundling in the new year. Likely in a few months, minor issues will sort out but these come to mind:  DSR without a robust plan or rigorous user research/modelling (putting governance on the hook for the inevitable USDC that ends up in the PSM as a result). RWA terms are 60 months, that\u2019s the majority of the age of makerdao in general.  Balancing minor objections against ushering GNO and the risk of renBTC was challenging which is primarily why we delayed. Not looking for drama or a fight, glad to see delegates push it across the line.

Anything that broadens Maker\u2019s risk management ability for our users and for the protocol is, in general, worth pursuing. But this idea is clearly something that should be a Gitcoin grant. Not something that maker is funding. Let us know when that\u2019s live so FBL can be the first DAI in. Also, FFS, read the Man who solved the markets to realize how much sentiment analysis works into the worlds largest hedge fund\u2019s models. What\u2019s most interesting about this SPF are:  We expect jumps to be at these hard coded values instead of variable values. \u2190 fair, but not a hill to die on. We could probably broaden our horizon of data sources and be more proactive than reactive (ideally even automated). \u2190 Trying to incorporate a predictive analysis score/alert makes sense but it shouldn\u2019t be the whole pie.  Like, these are okay assumptions, but then this whole thing goes off the rails. The tactics alongside this proposal  might be the most openly hostile thing on this forum to date. Which is saying a lot. Governance Communications Core Unit (COM-001) Funding Request - December 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Send it, have conviction in this team executing more endgame native programs in the near term. Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit (SAS-001) Funding Request - December 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Roadmap adjustments! Excellent. Also an ability to run auctions natively on a desktop is probably really useful side effect for inexperienced keepers to enter the markets. Dai Foundation Board Member Election Poll - December 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Daimon-Law Reasoning: Daimon Law has produced excellent comments in the community. Conflict of interest in other ecosystems here seems overblown but worth keeping an eye on. 0xBocaJ is awesome but the work in the ecosystem is a little close to be simultaneously on the board of the DAI foundation. His work is better spent on things like the legal quagmires of MetaDAO\u2019s because, well, his work is good and he\u2019s a fantastic contributor.

Ratification Poll for MIP14 Repeal (MIP4c4-SP2) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: Due to endgame\u2019s consistent changelog and a need to tighten up our resource allocation (people and projects), removing the ability to fund anything flexibly is problematic.

Sam\u2019s talk was also a good overview of why more keepers matter. Ratification Poll for Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults (MIP13c3-SP13) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Switching to yes, even through we helped author, because not only does the DAO need this, it\u2019s better to have conviction for the MIPs you contribute too.

Confident we can navigate this external mess to the benefit of the community. FBL volunteered to help steward a working group towards workable milestones setting parameters up for success. That being said, lowering to 100 MM is also acceptable. ",

The sim is also really helpful though, the debt weighted CR on ETH-C balancing against total volume & liquidity was a concern. Generally at this point in time it seems logical to open the floor.

Return Excess MIP65 Funds to Surplus Buffer - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Excited to see the first payments back to the DAO from Clydesdale. Increase the MIP65 (RWA007-A) Debt Ceiling - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: We do not share a combative stance or vitriol but Clydesdale clearly needs a slight restructuring based on community response & the confusion. Scopes or MIP, either way works. Ideally a scope so Clydesdale can be restructured into a win/win for everyone (better fee structure, clearer expectations). Also, some clearer guidelines on when there are problems and how to resolve them seem perfect for the framework\u2019s first use case. This vote just seemed just a bit out of order: throwing out huge sums without aligning on fees sounds like we\u2019ll be in the same debate in a month. Not gonna die on this hill, it\u2019s fine that we get excess yield, but will advocate for fixing those changes when the opportunity arises. Remove the DC-IAM from MIP65 (RWA007-A) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: The risk calculus here seems off, not dying on this hill either.
