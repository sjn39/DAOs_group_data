Do we apply the risk coefficient from Compound or uscd? To be honest I haven\u2019t got exactly how it works, but Comp should increase while usdc should decrease as we pay for the borrowing and get comp in exchange. what happens when there is no usdc and only debt? The code is relatively complex and need external call, input and output. Am I right? Looks there is a nice attack surface using compound and the wind, unwind. I feel it is another type of beast than PSM or a join token. Who is going to audit it?  ",

We\u2019ll talk about MIP30, which is the farmable cUSDC Adapter (CropJoin) Discussions about MIPs happen in the Forum.   MIP30: Farmable cUSDC Adapter (CropJoin)  MIP30: Farmable cUSDC Adapter (CropJoin) 00:44 - MIP30 with Lev and Rain  Discussion  09:39 - How do you make sure it\u2019s generic and it\u2019s not Comp-specific? 11:57 - You said that other protocols can use it, so I guess somebody like B.Protocol can easily use it by opening it up to USDC and having a simple way to get a USDC vault and B.Protocol users can get Comp rewards, right? 13:07 - Is there an additional benefit for the users? Because Comp gives you rewards both on the supply and the borrow side, so aren\u2019t users basically exposing themselves to the risk of Comp but then only getting half compensated for the borrowing? 17:12 - I think the collateral factor is fixed data. If Compound changed this collateral factor, what happens with the contract? 18:50 - There\u2019s a MIP or the Compound equivalent, and I\u2019m not sure if it passed or not, but there was something about vesting and locking the distribution for one month or something like that. What happens in that case? 22:45 - We are very dependent on Compound\u2019s behavior and changes \u2013 and this contract is not that flexible. And I also believe there\u2019s a risk of wind and unwind. Who is going to run it? 25:22 - How do you get your money back under normal circumstances? 28:30 - I think that one of the main problems is that wind and unwind are public, basically 30:44 - How exactly are the payment distributions going to be done? Because I\u2019ve got a small account with Comp and it\u2019s like a dollar worth of Comp tokens, and so that\u2019s not something that would be worthwhile for Maker to be sending out periodically, just with gas fees 32:57 - In the MIP30 application, you talked a little bit about the insolvency of Compound and the risk. Could you go over a scenario where that happened and how it would affect Maker? 37:10 - Basically, when you do Compound, you put USDC or DAI and you borrow more until a certain coefficient ratio, but when you maximize a certain level, you lost USDC or you lost DAI, but you get Comp, so you have a negative interest rate. There\u2019s another problem here, I think, because if the vault is full, for example, your USDC will decrease, your coefficient will increase and your vault will get liquidated by Compound. So you need an active management of the vault 41:28 - How do you liquidate the vaults? Do you liquidate them based on the USDC, for example\u2026? 43:23 - If we don\u2019t liquidate it we\u2019re going to get less USDC than what we have inside the world 47:05 - Would it be possible to get Gauntlet to run some scenarios? 52:22 - Did anyone from the Risk Team review this or is it in the plan, if they haven\u2019t yet? 53:24 - So that we don\u2019t lose money with this ratio, it needs to be quite high 55:35 - They had a problem with the liquidity on Curve. The problem is, if you can\u2019t withdraw your position, you can end up in a bad situation 59:33 - The community seems to think that we have too much exposure to USDC and that this is basically allowing for a riskier version of USDC. Do we have a response to that in terms of why it\u2019s still good to be implementing? 01:01:43 - Was it considered that we kind of introduced a circular dependency now between Compound and Dai? I mean, if Dai goes to zero, then the USDC will also likely go \u2013 maybe not to zero, but it will affect the Compound USDC price 01:03:49 - I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a complete pyramid, just that it does introduce some circularity. I\u2019m not an expert on emergency shutdown et cetera. Just wondering if it has any implications, though  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 01:05:23  Thank you, Lev and Rain, for this great presentation and the rest for joining me. It\u2019s always great to have you. Tomorrow (12.09.2020) we have B.Protocol at 7:00 PM UTC. And this Wednesday 9th of December at 6:00 PM UTC we\u2019ll have Melon Protocol. More information in the forum, as always, and let\u2019s keep the discussion going over there.  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary.  ",
