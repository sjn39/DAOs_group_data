                    "content": "I wanted to open a discussion about the COMP token drop, but also about liquidity mining more broadly. Given the high level of rewards offered, liquidity mining programs can cause considerable changes in capital allocation and user behavior. Compound\u2019s COMP token is currently trading over $200, implying a $2B fully diluted market cap. Roughly half of the token is circulating, but largely in the hands of large investors and insiders so not really representative of free float. The explainer about how COMP is distributed can be found here, and Compound has a distribution dashboard as well. Currently, 2828 out of 2880 COMP per day (~98%) is being distributed to the borrowers and lenders in the USDT market. Because half of the COMP is paid out to borrowers in proportion to the dollar value of interest paid, it can partially or completely offset the cost of borrowing depending on COMP price and total interest paid per day. This can be computed as a discount percentage, with all values over 100% indicating an effective negative interest rate: (1440 * COMP price) / total interest paid per day = discount percentage Using current values of (1440 * $220) / $71500 = 443%, all compound markets are offering borrowers negative effective rates (paying borrowers to borrow) equal to over 3x the stated APR. While I imagine the price of COMP will come down gradually as supply is released on the market, this is currently a huge competitive advantage for borrowing with Compound versus other platforms. This pull of assets (particularly USDT and stablecoins) to Compound has been felt over at Aave, where interest rates for USDT and TUSD both topped 30%. Deposit interest rates on WBTC have also risen above 4% on Aave, likely due to Curve\u2019s new sBTC pool which is currently generating ~25% APY in SNX/REN (with CRV and BAL coming soon) on top of normal swap fees. A substantial amount of ETH has flowed into Compound in the last few days, and millions of dollars worth of WBTC have also been deposited (probably in expectation that Compound may accept WBTC as collateral). This could affect Maker both by increasing overall crypto leverage and risk, as well as by increasing competition among platforms to retain borrowers. Do we need to do anything to ensure we remain competitive? Any idea of how the risk landscape is changing because of these programs? ",

Clever yield farmers realized that it is easy to max out utilization on small cap coins, which yields more COMP than simply borrowing/depositing USDT. Similar dynamic is happening with ZRX (11% base APY). If these conditions persist it will be uneconomical to maintain BAT or ZRX vaults. Dharma has submitted a proposal to decouple Compound\u2019s DAI interest rate model from Maker\u2019s interest rates. If this passes in ~2 weeks, the likely result will be Compound\u2019s DAI deposit and borrowing rate trending higher than Maker\u2019s rates. This could potentially incentivize minting DAI to deposit to Compound. ",

                    "content": "As for how long this lasts, I believe there are a few factors at play. The first factor being the strength of positive reflexivity in this market. As it\u2019s currently playing out, I see this as some 2017 stuff at play. If Bitcoin\u2019s volatility remains low, I could see COMP staying at elevated prices and encouraging borrowing across supported assets for some time (remember float is low). As it stands, 57.71% has been distributed to team members, founders, investors, and partners. I have yet to find if there is a lockup period for this group. 42.29% will be distributed over the next 4 years. If there is no lockup period for the early founders group, the potential for a massive price decline is present. If there is a lockup period, I see more stability with the price as there is a more predictable rate of inflation. My final point is that as new incentives become increasingly common (Synthetix, Ren, Balancer), liquidity will flow back and forth between these protocols. This could lead to volatile interest rates between the protocols. In this case, I believe Compound may drain its customer acquisition budget (42.29% of the protocols value) by arbitrageurs. The thing that concerns me the most is the size of loans against less liquid assets such as BAT. As it currently stands, there is ~$129,000,000 in BAT loans on the platform (about 36% of all BAT outstanding ). I sincerely hope their liquidation engine is able to perform in the event that market volatility across the globe increases (109,000 BTC Options Expire by Friday & concerns about a second wave of virus outbreaks causing market turbulence in active markets) I\u2019m grateful @monet-supply pointed out the proposal submitted by Dharma. If that passes, we benefit even more so. Coumpound is borrowing from its future value to incentivize supplying and borrowing. DAI is one of the assets that is included in this incentivized program, yet we are not diluting our MKR supply. We are already seeing the benefit (I believe about 8 million DAI has been minted since the program launched). As such, I don\u2019t see a need to introduce negative effective interest rates. However, I am but one man with one opinion. I encourage anyone with a different opinion to chime in! ",

Maker\u2019s DAI borrow rate = 0%, so the total position return/cost on $2,000 capital ($3,000 BAT - $1,000 DAI) is 0%.

And ctokens and Balancer liquidity tokens could make for some great collateral on Maker. Would need some engineering work so that users could still earn COMP and BAL on their collateral. ctokens have exposure to compound protocol risk. They can also be used as collateral to borrow stuff on compound with rebates. But users might trust maker more. Balancer liquidity tokens are also interesting. But the oracle team might have trouble with pricing them. These are both new liquidity incentives, they\u2019re still evolving.

                    "content": "When the same people are taking out loans against the same collateral like this iteratively the growth is illusory. I think the greatest benefit could be more widespread distribution of governance tokens, but we\u2019ve already seen that at compound this just means more optimization for comp distribution. It all kind of amounts to a sugar high and ultimately the value has to come from somewhere. So where does that value come from? Control over the assets in compound? It is growing, but if borrowers are getting negative rates and lenders are also getting paid then even the assets locked in compound aren\u2019t worth anything per se, they are losing cashflow every day rather than producing cashflow. This is unlikely to change also, since comp holders are incentivized to vote for continued payouts over rational policy. It seems like the only place this value can really be derived from is the comp token itself, causing the token to reduce in price as more people cash out. Maybe we\u2019ve already seen that begin. But trying to emulate something like this would at least be a disaster for mkr holders, and might ruin the entire risk balance for the platform. ",

This change would make COMP distribution proportional to total $ amount borrowed, instead of the current method of allocating based on interest paid. Discussion can be found here. So far, it looks like this update is likely to pass almost unanimously. This will greatly increase the allocation of COMP directed to the DAI market. image1412\u00d7498 72.8 KB Assuming 2% DAI borrowing rate on Compound, the total cost of borrowing is ~$55 per $1M borrowed per day. The chart above indicates distribution of 3.4886 COMP per $1M borrowed per day, which is equivalent to over $800 in rebates per day at the current COMP price of ~$240. Netting these figures against each other, $1M DAI borrowed on Compound yields ~$750 in gains per day, for an annualized APY of around 30%. The proposal has around 2 days left for voting, and then a 2 day time-lock before it can be executed. ",
