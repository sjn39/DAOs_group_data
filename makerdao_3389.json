It expands upon these signals by @iammeeoh. Motivation The goal is to further nurture high-level needs from the MakerDAO community, build potential Facilitator candidates in a pipeline, and offer an opportunity for crowdsourcing best solutions. A few benefits to this approach:  Better exploration for open ended needs Offer an opportunity for proposals to develop before submitting a Core Unit MIP Offers opportunities for those interested in leading an initiative Opportunity to work with other community members (such as facilitators) Crowdsource better ideas Give a more fair and open evaluation rather than resumes and closed interviews The community can give and receive feedback Even if proposers are not selected for the role, they can continue to contribute to the community  Process Anyone is able to submit a \u201cCall for Proposals\u201d, which signals roles or initiatives that are looking for organizers or leads.
