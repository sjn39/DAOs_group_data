                    "content": " Request for Review of the Proposed Future for the Grant Programs and GR16 as we Transition to the Protocol Reference: Future of the grants program, Gitcoin Protocol Launch Event and Gitcoin Brand Evolution I\u2019d like to call out fellow DAO contributors @connor @lthrift @nategosselin @ceresstation @kevin.olsen @Viriya who co-wrote and/or deeply contributed much of this thinking. I\u2019d also like to call out all 23 contributors from all our workstreams in the DAO that participated in our cross-workstream GR16 planning workshop.  TL;DR We\u2019re currently at a pivotal point in the Gitcoin Grants journey as we determine how to best transition from the centralized grants program to the grants protocol in a way that scales up our ability to help our communities fund their shared needs. We would love your reflection and thoughts around this key transition decision. We believe that it is in the best interests of our community to let our program take a breath in S16 so that we can fully prepare for our grants protocol future. Specifically, we propose that we do not run GR16 in December and use the bandwidth to prepare the protocol launch in Q1 2023. If you\u2019re opposed to this suggestion, our other consideration is running GR16 in December in a smaller / more manageable capacity. The core Grants team has explored several options for this transition period (see full exploration details below) and we believe that this pause is our best option. If the community agrees with this recommendation, the PGF, MMM, FDD and Support team would all shift focus immediately to prioritize our exciting future Gitcoin Grants program and support our partners\u2019 programs transition to our decentralized and permissionless protocol. We would ideally launch the new Gitcoin Grants Program in Q1, 2023 and begin transitioning our partner\u2019s programs onto the protocol at the same time. This would be an exciting step for Gitcoin to make sure we\u2019re building a strong foundation as we start the next step of our journey as a DAO. If you are opposed to this suggestion, an alternate option is running GR16 Dec 1-15, 2022 on C-Grants with a narrowed scope that would only include rounds focused on core Gitcoin community themes. These would likely include rounds for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, ZKTech and cause rounds such as DeSci, Climate and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI). We would start partnering with all other partners from rounds to transition to the protocol after GR16 is complete. This would not include a main round and would be set up this way to reduce the current friction associated with running such a complex grants program on the fragile C-grants platform. While this would mean that we continue with our typical quarterly cadence for GR16, we would likely need to refocus and delay the launch of our program on the protocol. We ask our community to share their reactions to the suggestion of sunsetting c-grants and voice what they think is best for the future success of Gitcoin. When commenting please specify if you\u2019re a Partner, Steward, Grantee, Donor or Gitcoin Contributor.  Context and Details to Consider  Our Ideal Final State Vision As a reminder, at a high level we aspire to provide the mechanisms to help communities \u2013 whether they be DAOs, companies, countries, cities, not-for-profits, groups of friends \u2013 fund their collective needs in the way that is right for them. Our ambition with this new protocol & program delineation is to be able to accomplish this vision on a much larger scale, funding tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars in shared needs through a permissionless and decentralized system. The first post about the future of the grants program summarized the history of the program, our current state, key aspirations for the future and the three key elements to make our next phase for Gitcoin Grants successful. We aligned on the idea that in order to achieve this aspiration, the future state will have three major components - the Protocol, the Gitcoin Grants Program and Grants Services.   The Protocol: A Decentralized and Permissionless Platform to run Fully Independent Grant Programs  For communities that do not require any service and minimal support, they can run a grants program on the protocol on their own. There will still be a small team focused on partner grant program success (in onboarding partners) and call center style support    Gitcoin Grants Program  A major event that happens on a regular basis (i.e. quarterly) in which GTC holders select N# of causes they wish to fund to have an impact  This means there is no single \u201cmain round\u201d but instead a main event with a set number of impact areas, voted on by the community, with their own eligibility criteria. Initially we will start this as four key areas the community cares about supporting but could grow this as we see fit to help achieve the largest impact as Gitcoin, with support from the community, while helping drive protocol interest.      Grants \u201cServices\u201d  We will provide services to ecosystem grant programs running on the protocol. These may be fully supported rounds, a tiered offering or an \u201ca la carte\u201d menu from our list of supported services (marketing, FDD, operations as a service). We would manage how we scale up our services model based on demand. Note: Partners are still welcome to manage their own programs or use a 3rd party provider, so the GitcoinDAO services capacity is not a limiting factor to growth     Where We are Today Gitcoin Grants has prioritized running quarterly grants rounds and scaling GMV. We\u2019ve been mostly successful and have grown round over round since inception although declining in recent rounds. However we\u2019ve increased program complexity with adding new rounds to our program every round. The GR15 program consisted of a general main round, four cause rounds (climate round, crypto advocacy, DEI and DeSci) and 12 ecosystem rounds (for projects that want to fund growth in their specific ecosystem). We run all these rounds together in a two week period once a quarter. The current process, scale, complexity and lack of product updates (due to our product teams focus on developing the protocol), is under significant strain. The current scalability challenges and complexity of the c-grants program are unnecessarily creating an unpleasant experience for grantees, donors, partners and our Gitcoin contributors / team. These program challenges span across:  The number of rounds we run in a two week period When we open and close the grantee application period Our manual grantee review process Increasing fraud and sybil attacks The speed of our round cadence The fragility of and tech debt in our legacy centralized product (c-grants)  In order to transition to the protocol successfully, it\u2019s critical for us to build a better decentralized grants program that alleviates some of these challenges, while achieving the protocol objectives: a decentralized grants protocol that scales our overall impact both as Gitcoin Grants and as a broader community to fund our shared needs. As Gitcoin, we have to make a hard decision around the most strategic way to sunset the C-grants product and transition to the Gitcoin Grants Protocol in a way that prioritizes a successful transition to the protocol and a positive experience for our key stakeholders.  Considerations for GR16 After many internal conversations around this complex and nuanced decision and a broader team retrospective with a representative from every workstream (23 individuals in attendance) of what GR16 should look like, we aligned on two main options (mentioned above and shared again below). In the activity we outlined risks and benefits of both options for you to review as a way to inform or reflect your own perspective. Option 1: Sunset C-grants and focus our team on launching our program on the protocol in Q1, 2023. We would do this while working with partners to help launch their programs on the protocol late Q1 and Q2, 2023. Note, with this option, this does not exclude the opportunity to have partners donate to existing Gitcoin grants in December if we feel strongly about supporting our top grants on the same regular cadence. Whatever we do in this decision, we\u2019d ideally like to focus on still delivering value to grantees and partners, while prioritizing our team\u2019s time around launching the protocol. Option 2: Run GR16 Dec 1-15, 2022 on C-Grants with a narrowed scope that would only include rounds focused on core Gitcoin community themes. This would not include a main round. While this would mean that we continue with our typical quarterly cadence for GR16, we would have to revisit the turn around time to transition to the protocol. Below are summaries of all the risks and benefits contributors shared during our workshops that helped inform our broader decision:  Option 1: Sunset C-Grants and Launch our Gitcoin Program on the Protocol in Q1 Risks The main risk to consider is that the protocol is still not fully ready by a program launch event at the end of February/ March. If we end up pushing back our program further because of delays, we may lose credibility with a lot of our community. Risk factors to our stakeholders  Grantees  Grantees will be upset that GR16 is not happening as some projects depend on our funding Uncertainty and changes to the program may create panic Gitcoin may lose some grantees because of changing the cadence Gitcoin is concerned that GR15 wasn\u2019t enough of a goodbye round   Donors  Donors have become used to our quarterly cadence and we may lose some if we transition to the protocol a few months delayed December is a key time for donations   Partners  Partners may be upset about rounds they wanted to run this quarter and have pre-paid for (note there may still be the opportunity to donate to specific grants partners would still like to support) We may lose some funders in the transition   Stewards  Stewards may wonder if Gitcoin will lose momentum if we don\u2019t run GR16 in December   Gitcoin Internal / Contributors  There is increased risk of the product team moving too fast to deliver and as a result have many more bugs and issues Support will have a lot of questions about why there is not a round that they will have to manage    Benefits The main benefit of sunsetting c-grants is that our team can fully focus on defining the strategy and begin executing around how we transition the Gitcoin program and our partners to the protocol. In addition we can spend time including our community in voting on how we decentralize our grants program and causes to focus our funding efforts around. Benefits to our stakeholders  Grantees  Grantees can start learning about the protocol and have enough time to get up to speed and reopen their grants on the protocol vs being rushed between rounds Grantees won\u2019t have to go through the current c-grants process again, including the manual and broken grant review process, which caused a lot of frustration and backlash in GR15   Donors  Donors can start learning about the protocol and how to fund on the protocol through our smaller design partner rounds before participating in our program round This break could relieve donor fatigue   Partners  Partners can get some breathing room and will have the potential to be more organized around how they run rounds with us in a decentralized fashion Partners will no longer have to navigate the challenging review process and instead will get to experience the protocol review process. Partners would receive more attention from the Gitcoin team in their transition, so while decreasing the number of grants funded in December, we will hopefully help partners build a higher quality grants program on the protocol Partners can build out the programs they want to build out vs run them how Gitcoin expects them to   Stewards  Stewards will rally around our focus on becoming a decentralized protocol and program   Gitcoin Internal / Contributors  All contributors involved in running the c-grants will avoid wasted hours and attention on c-grants, a platform that will not be used again The team will have increased focus on the grants protocol / program launch We will be able to really reflect on the current program structure and have time to create a real strategy around the future, test it properly and develop our services offering while partnering with partners to transition effectively The internal team can be focused on mapping out talent needs to thrive on the protocol without burning out and dealing with more attrition of highly talented team members who are frustrated with the current platform and dealing with burnout The team can be invested in bridging grantees from c-grants to the grants protocol will take time and energy     Option 2: Run a small GR16 C-grants round Risks to our stakeholders  Grantees  We will receive backlash for running a smaller round and that it\u2019s seen as us losing momentum vs reprioritizing There will be limited improvement around grant review timelines, support help and fraud review Many projects will receive less funding and look elsewhere for funding If our team runs the round, we will not be able to think about and invest in how we structure the protocol launch and future until mid-Q1 2023   Donors  Donors doubt Gitcoin\u2019s stability and ability to scale given the fragility of the c-grants platform (especially with the number of times the site goes down) Lose engagement from donors   Partners  Partners might really want to run a round or have already committed to running a round that we turn down The size of the round will still interrupt momentum of recurring rounds for all ecosystem partners We would have to pick specific partners, which may come across as if we are picking favorites   Stewards  Stewards will be concerned about running a smaller round while also not being fully ready to transition to the protocol   Gitcoin Internal / Contributors  The C-grants platform requires immense effort to run in its current state and even running a smaller round will likely require the same if not more effort due to communicating changes all to still communicate the change to the protocol the following round, improving / changing the review process etc. all to abandon it after We will see burnout between the shorter timeline between GR15 and GR16 and the increased need to support with both the program and the protocol development The current rounds take the full attention of PGF Partnerships, Grant Ops and MMM for 6-8 weeks, FDD works close to 24/7 during the round and product needs to help resolve a lot of bugs and issues with the product during the round, when we need them focused on developing the protocol The team will not be able to transition focus to any work on the protocol until mid-Jan. This includes supporting the protocol and investing in the strategy and execution of transitioning to the protocol, building out the program strategy and services for the protocol.    Benefits  Grantees  Grantees may find it easier to understand what rounds we are running because it is more focused This shift alludes to where our future state program vision might be   Donors  Donors will find it easier to donate because there will be fewer grants and the rounds will be more defined   Partners  Will appreciate that they are supporting core building for the ecosystem during a bear market   Stewards  Stewards will appreciate that we\u2019re still making an effort to run rounds and support public goods   Gitcoin Internal / Contributors  The team can work on making the round more manageable between now and December    Based on the above risks and benefits, and the exciting future we\u2019re moving toward, internally we\u2019re leaning toward fully refocusing our time on a successful protocol launch in Q1 and not running a round in December. However, we recognize that this decision does not come without trade-offs and a significant investment of time over the next few months to make this a success. Helping us weigh in on which of these options is of critical value, and we want to hear from as many people as possible. We appreciate your reactions, thoughts and ideas to help us inform our final decision. Once a healthy dialog has occurred here, we hope to crystalize the result with a snapshot vote. ",

The Gitcoin DAO team has spent an immense amount of time going deep and wide on this decision and considering all the nuances and complexities of the best next move. I have appreciated the strong leadership and commitment from across the team on this topic. As a workstream lead of the Gitcoin Product Collective (GPC) and the former VP of Product at Gitcoin Holdings where the protocol was incepted, I\u2019m very supportive of the organization sunsetting the centralized grants program and spending a short season focused on the transition to full decentralization. The protocols are now in closed beta and ready for active testing through production use. This means we are at the point of being ready to execute on any unique features for the Gitcoin Grants program and begin scaling up adoption. While we have been collaborating cross-functionally over the last several months of design and implementation, all the other workstreams have had a main focus quarter over quarter on running the next centralized grants round. Having the full focus of the rest of the DAO (marketing, PGF ops, support, FDD) on the design and implementation of a large scale, decentralized grants program is critical to our collective long term success. I couldn\u2019t be more bullish on the future of more effectively allocating capital and enabling communities to fund their shared needs. Let\u2019s make this turn together! ",

As a Gitcoin Contributor and Steward (and Donor although I\u2019m not sure if my quarterly $100 donations count lol), I lean towards directing our efforts to ensuring the Grants Protocol, the product that the entire DAO is now aligned towards building with the ratified Purpose and Essential Intents, gets all the attention it needs. However I share the main fear identified by this group that going full-tilt on Option 1 could have detrimental impacts on the community\u2019s perception of Gitcoin and the excitement + momentum we build during each Grants Round. Six months (or potentially longer) is a very long time in this ecosystem, and as a team we need more time (and capacity) to re-jig our engagement and marketing + education efforts, which are currently mainly focused on the Grants Program, towards the Grants Protocol. The one thing that Gitcoin decidedly does better than other grants programs in the ecosystem is the hype that our Grants Rounds generate (and this is no doubt due to the massive effort made by the team during these rounds). I believe six months is enough time for both our brand to lose that central place it holds in web3 as well as competitors to catch up in terms of narrative/product. And there\u2019s no point focusing our efforts in developing a product that people aren\u2019t excited about.  It\u2019d be one thing if we were starting from scratch in terms of community buy-in, but to lose this credibility after all the work we\u2019ve done  to build it would be a huge loss. My suggestion would be to meet somewhere in the middle of even these two options (even though Option 2 is sort of offered as a \u201cmiddle option\u201d). Over the next few months, we will have a better-defined engagement and product marketing strategy geared towards the Protocol, and having a small Grants Round as scheduled could be the buffer we need to maintain momentum. Option 2 as offered still includes six rounds - what if we just had 2-3 of the most popular of these options (OSS, Climate)? I think our Partners will be more understanding if their rounds end up getting delayed due to this (they run on longer timeframes and don\u2019t lose interest as quickly), but users (donors/grantees) may be less forgiving - running a small GR16 can help provent a complete collapsing of narrative/interest. Whatever direction we choose, I fully believe in this team\u2019s ability to deliver a fantastic product. I know this because we already have one, and I\u2019d like us to make sure we give it the thoughtful farewell that it deserves. ",

If you\u2019re opposed to this suggestion, our other consideration is running GR16 in December in a smaller / more manageable capacity.   I agree on the central thesis of this post. The protocol is launching, cGrants is more hurtful than helpful, and we need a transition plan that best prepares us for the launch of the protocol. I do not like option 1 at all. A decision to not do any grants round, especially without doing one for the Ethereum ecosystem, is a decision which means people getting laid off before Christmas across the ecosystem. There are projects that live and die by our quarterly cadence. I can\u2019t support surprising them with only 2 months notice. I do think there is an option that could get the best of both worlds. Perhaps even more limited than your option 2. One round, only those which fit the main round criteria. We would need to clearly define the QPQ, token, and other policy items, but the learning would be priceless. Additionally, the Ethereum ecosystem would continue receiving their quarterly support. I\u2019d push to say the long held Ethereum/OSS norms for inclusion in this round rather than all public goods. Maybe two rounds where grants must choose between the Ethereum/OSS round or all public goods round? If you accept my reasoning for having a round or two as a must, then let\u2019s think about why my suggestion would be different than your option 2.     J9leger:  The current scalability challenges and complexity of the c-grants program are unnecessarily creating an unpleasant experience for grantees, donors, partners and our Gitcoin contributors / team. These program challenges span across:  The number of rounds we run in a two week period When we open and close the grantee application period Our manual grantee review process Increasing fraud and sybil attacks The speed of our round cadence The fragility of and tech debt in our legacy centralized product (c-grants)     Only 1 or 2 rounds We close applications 1 week before the round starts No change to manual review process No change to speed of round Avoid using the things that have the biggest issues  Reduced complexity saves time spent reviewing grants The one or two round option makes it a much cleaner review process which doesn\u2019t involve the many ecosystem and cause round owners! Unique learning opportunity We don\u2019t have any study on the effect of having so many rounds which impact each others matching pool. It would be extremely useful to see what happens when all the rounds are in one (or two but mutually exclusive) pool(s). Potential to run more parts on the Protocol Perhaps there is an opportunity to run more parts on the protocol to progressively test it as we have with Passport. ",

Precedent/convention, expected patterns of repeated generosity are important factors.

This is more likely given the depressed market in general. 1) With more notice time of cancelled or materially changed GR16, the more chance community projects will properly decide their Q4-2022/Q1-2023 costs and not accidentally overspend. => Mitigate risk of insolvency caused by community projects expecting a reasonable range of capital in Q4 2022 from GR16, based on their GR15, GR14, GR13 track record. 2) I suggest still running GR16 but only offer it to existing grants that have received at least X amount of donations. => Lower GitcoinDAO\u2019s administrative overhead a lot while managing the Web3 community cash-flow \u201cdetrimental reliance\u201d ethical concerns as much as possible.

                    "content": "Thank you for the excellent write-up. This is a bet the DAO type of decision - if we decide to burn the boats today to shift to our protocol future. I have been involved in companies shifting from SaaS and more or less proprietary approaches to software delivery to one based on community adoption.  In my experience it is always more difficult than anticipated; done right, this shift impacts almost everyone and all activities. I believe this shift towards community adoption of grants protocol ++ poses a risk to us at least as significant as the risk expressed in the write-up of whether our grants protocol launch will immediately hit PMF and sufficient stability at 1.0.  For instance, I\u2019m somewhat tangentially exposed to our efforts to potentially build a DevRel motion and while I\u2019m likely missing a lot of effort that has occurred and not been publicized yet - I think we inevitably have quite a ways to go to shift teams around and onboard them and so on, to get developer docs & a community going, and much more including cultural shifts. Net/net I don\u2019t think we fully appreciate how large a transition this is; if we do, it might make sense to publicize what that plan would look like to transform the DAO to be focused on the community self-adoption of Grants protocol as it would impact nearly everyone in the DAO and others in the community.  If we don\u2019t have that plan yet then we may not be quite ready to decide to bet on that plan. We have incredible talent in the DAO and people emerge from the broader web3 world all the time looking to help.  We can and will make a transition to a protocols future grounded on community self-adoption - in time. Finally, I like the suggestion from @DisruptionJoe to focus on the open-source aspects of our grant rounds.  We could then use this round as a means to further cement ties to developers, who are becoming our key persona as we shift to the protocol future. ",

Im down to work together to make things work regardless ofcourse, this was just my initial reaction to the idea. I believe a stripped down version of the grants round on the existing platform for a round or two is the best way to go. The cause rounds all have very active communities that can increasingly be involved in running these rounds as we transition to protocol. It would be a real shame to lose momentum with this work and also slow down our partnerships conversations. Unless we think we will be ready to roll things out early in the new year at the latest I think we need to ride it till the wheels fall off with what we still have. To continue the metaphor that would mean slowing down and being careful to maximize the chances things wont break down. It would be great if we could do a small intake of any new grantees for only 4 rounds before the round starts. Which would mean mid November. DEI, DeSci, Climate and MainRound. Sounds good to me. ",

I think this thread is an important discussion for our community as whole to engage with, and I hope we are also exploring how to extend the reach of this post to meaningfully engage our grantees, partners, and donors to validate some of the risks and benefits mapped out above so that we are not setting strategy in a vacuum. It can\u2019t be overstated the massive team effort required to run our program on cGrants. In GR15, contributors worked very long hours each day to review and approve grants, answer support questions, and troubleshoot/fix bugs that arose on the platform. That\u2019s on top of all of the work that went into onboarding new grantees and donors, creating support documentation for our knowledge base, and socializing the grants round. Essentially, for four weeks (the 2 weeks before the grants round and the 2 week of) these teams slow all other work to focus on making GR15 as successful as possible. I wonder what it would be like if instead all these contributors were focused wholly on preparing for the protocol launch. But as tempting as Option 1 is, ultimately, I think it\u2019s a bit risky when we have the option and opportunity to socialize the future state of our grants program in a much smaller, more manageable GR16. My main concern in pursuing Option 2 is a failure to message all changes early, which has the potential to be doubly damaging to our brand, with the teams involved failing to prepare our community for the launch and failing to serve our grantees and partners meaningfully on cGrants.  Ultimately, this risk is manageable with the development of a robust engagement strategy as a core component of any planning effort. As an important player in the ecosystem, it\u2019s the DAO\u2019s responsibility to handle changes like this with care. Engaging and over-communicating will be a necessary component of the transformative future state we\u2019re building. ",

We will be running design partner rounds on the protocol before we transition over the program so there will still be momentum and excitement around programs on the protocol.  Six months (or potentially longer) is a very long time in this ecosystem, and as a team we need more time (and capacity) to re-jig our engagement and marketing + education efforts, which are currently mainly focused on the Grants Program, towards the Grants Protocol.  I\u2019m unclear about this sentence. The reason we would be refocusing our energy on launching the protocol is due to the necessity of prioritizing our time around marketing + education efforts, engaging the community in choosing what areas of focus we prioritize to fund as the program and more. This wouldn\u2019t mean going silent for 6  months, it would mean engaging our community of grantees, donors and funders around the transition to the protocol. During this time we\u2019d also be prioritizing delivering something that our community would be excited about.  what if we just had 2-3 of the most popular of these options (OSS, Climate)? I think our Partners will be more understanding if their rounds end up getting delayed due to this (they run on longer timeframes and don\u2019t lose interest as quickly), but users (donors/grantees) may be less forgiving - running a small GR16 can help provent a complete collapsing of narrative/interest.  To this point, running any round will still require a similar investment in effort as a the option 2 suggested, taking time and energy from the transition to delivering the protocol faster and potentially cause more upset grantees for the many that wouldn\u2019t be in the round.

A decision to not do any grants round, especially without doing one for the Ethereum ecosystem, is a decision which means people getting laid off before Christmas across the ecosystem. There are projects that live and die by our quarterly cadence. I can\u2019t support surprising them with only 2 months notice.  Thanks for sharing your concerns. I think it important to look at some data analysis here. Less than 200 grantees from the previous round received above $5K and only 105 received more than $10K. It\u2019s unclear to me how many projects solely rely on Gitcoin to fund their contributors salaries given the volatility around match amount round after round. Option 1 also doesn\u2019t negate the opportunity to still fund a small number of existing grantees in the time we would have run GR16.   We close applications 1 week before the round starts No change to manual review process   If we ran GR16, not changing the manual review process feels extremely detrimental to our community given how painful this process was for grantees, funders and our team. Not to mention the huge number of sybil attacks and fraud we saw and almost let fall through the cracks this season due to this manual process.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to run more parts on the protocol to progressively test it as we have with Passport.  There is 100 percent an opportunity to run rounds with design partners on the protocol in the interim and should be where we are prioritizing our time. Appreciate your thoughtful perspective Joe and your hope to see something happen to support our core community of grantees in GR16. ",

As mentioned before, the cost of marketing a smaller round vs. a larger rounds will require the same lift from the MMM team in terms of assets developed, coordination efforts, etc. It costs MMM an estimated $150,000 to run the marketing efforts of a Grants Round. This includes:  PT Ecosystem round coordinator PT Cause round coordinator Art direction + asset design and development Content development (for blog and social media) Strategic oversight Operations oversight Analytics analysis during and post-grants round Social media monitoring and support  There are about 10 people who are on the MMM team that will be diverting our attention from the Protocol launch to promoting the grants round. Note: this also does not include the cost of PGF Grassroots efforts around Twitter Spaces (running 3x per week, which is no small task). What I would prefer to see is our efforts redirected toward our maximizing:  the impact of our protocol launch AND a deep dive into impact reporting  We have monumental task ahead of us to launch the Grants Protocol successfully. From a well thought-out content strategy to a fulsome communication & public relations plan, and creating an impact report + repository of success stories to determining a marketing services launch plan, MMM has its work cut out for itself. Promoting a Grants Round in December will serve mostly as a distraction for our team. By not running a Grants Round and focusing on our Protocols Launch (and all its associated activities), MMM is poised to request around $50,000-$75,000 less in budget in S16.  On a separate note, I think above all our #1 goal as a DAO is to get the Grants Protocol launched ASAP. If we think from this first principle, our goal should be to support the GPC team in every way possible to get this thing shipped. By running ANYTHING on cgrants, we distract them from this goal and jeopardize the success of Gitcoin regardless of the risks of not running a Grants Round in December. This is why, once again, I am in support of Option 1. Other options I would consider:  Running a small grants round ON the Grants Protocol prior to our intended launch in S17 Doing minimal marketing and promotions during a GR16, which allows the MMM team to focus resources and efforts on the Protocol launch  ",

This is more likely given the depressed market in general.   I do understand that this will indeed still require a similar investment in effort as the previous rounds, but hope we can mitigate this a bit by more efficiently allocating resources for this upcoming season, through cross-workstream collaboration, to lighten the burden on PGF, specifically by MMM taking over more tasks (already on the way) and FDD helping out wherever necessary. From the side of DAOops (speaking as a WS lead) I hope we can also support here by lowering any \u2018overhead\u2019 by extra meetings that can currently be seen as a distraction in these times of hyperfocus on the launch. (as also discussed live) I definitely like the idea by Joe and echoes by others to focus on OSS and a very minimal approach. I also really like this suggestion to limit new grant creations for this upcoming round as expressed by @bestape, which could further free up resources on FDD\u2019s side but no idea if this is practically and technically feasible.

                    "content": "Really appreciate the transparent and detailed summary highlighting the pros/cons/logistical needs of each option @J9leger. As someone directly involved w/ the funding conversations w/ partners, I foresee a loss of credibility  if we were to announce dropping GR16 completely w/ minimal advance warning. Would hate to see our hard-earned goodwill to tank from rugging our main offering; regardless of grantees financials truly rely on our funding, Gitcoin\u2019s grants program is our bread and butter QoQ and its absence in Q4 will certainly be noticed. I think there are a couple more ways we can reduce the friction from running/transitioning Cgrants to the Protocol:  Reducing our focus to 3-4 top performing relevant cause rounds to maintain our level of QoQ consistency  No main round, no ecosystem round\u2013apart from our select Design Partner trials Selected PGF cause round leads to focus on GR16, while the PGF contributors who normally focus on a round that wasn\u2019t selected can focus on the Protocol transition   Reducing time window for grant applications to mid November Reducing the # of new grant applicants we accept, prioritizing returning quality grantees\u2013also increasing funding for high-value/signaled projects Finally: wondering how large of a lift it would be involve Passport usage into GR16 Cgrants to bolster sybil resistance?  Not talking product integration for Cgrants\u2013can imagine running an Excel matching formula on a spreadsheet to cross reference verified Passport users w/ grant applicants by November X could suffice to knock out low-effort attacks, while giving us decent time to review the remaining. Give audience a heads up that w/ increased sybil attacks\u2013grant applicants must also have verified Passport Not as decentralized as people imagine us to be\u2013but free money simply can\u2019t be handed out this easily without trust, and reasonable people should understand.    From PGF\u2019s conversations, I\u2019ve observed that funders are more excited over our cause rounds that relate to their interests/pillars, because it shows how closely Gitcoin is listening, while supposedly benefitting their business. Although funders recognize the impressive legacy of our main round & are impressed by our early successful grantees\u2013as the Ethereum ecosystem currently stands\u2013it\u2019s extremely saturated at this point w/ even the Merge not creating much effect in this market. My conclusion is less people are building on Eth, and money is going towards specific interests/niches and other chains. Although Main Round is easiest to verify tags, I think a few specific Cause Rounds are the way to go here, axing Main and Ecosystem during GR16. Not many orgs offer what we offer so consistently, and the potential complaints about the reduced funds/focus can be countered pretty easily by revisiting our Vision of \u201cempowering communities to fund their shared needs.\u201d Although it doesn\u2019t feel very empowering to reduce rounds, raise requirements, and tighten deadlines, it\u2019s even less empowering to rely on a manual, centralized system that can lose grant money to sybil attackers. Like any good public infrastructure, systems are generally forced to temporarily restrict access to make improvements, like roads and operating systems. Regardless of what we decide, I foresee pushback any way we do it. But rugging GR16 100% worries me about people\u2019s belief in Gitcoin, which will reflect in our token price lol. Humans hate change, even when it\u2019s good for them, so imo the best thing we can do is preparing our counters / documentation / explainer threads to remind them that what we are doing is still extremely true to Gitcoin\u2019s founding vision. TLDR; Reduce rounds from 7+ main/eco/cause to ~3 top cause. Move grantee application cutoff date in November, increase barrier to entry for safety. Ensure we have materials revisiting our original Vision prepared to counter potential dissent. Allow Cause Round leads for selected upcoming cause rounds focus on GR16, while allowing rest of team to focus on Protocol transition. PS: Definitely talking very theoretically\u2013only joined Gitcoin a couple months ago so GR15 was my first round here. Please take my words with a pinch of salt. ",

I\u2019m only an initiative lead, but my personal feeling is that there are a lot of areas that require more DAO wide coordination to ensure an optimal protocol launch.

Not to mention the huge number of sybil attacks and fraud we saw and almost let fall through the cracks this season due to this manual process.   I honestly believe the policy should be changed or more clearly defined and we should all be very open to evolution(my self included\u2026I got stuck reviewing grants because we got so many of em\u2026that wasn\u2019t my intent when I joined the DAO). Almost all of of the grants that were involved in malicious activities were caught before the payouts(just like previous seasons and ~ 250k was saved- not talking about the ring connor spotted, but about grant investigations, which end after the round).This round the grant investigations which I\u2019ve started in season 13 delivered just like every round even if we\u2019ve had a huge workload to handle during the rounds because of platform/main round eligibility I feel that what was never understond about the manual reviews was that by decentralizing grant reviews we actually leveraged the collective intelligence of our community even if at a small scale, even if they are manual. The difficult part is that without clearer policy or a \u201cdifferent review system\u201d (which no one currently has a solution 4 and which will not 100% prevent bad actors) we couldn\u2019t deny grants that are just the same as the others before the round begins. After the GR15 begun they sybil attack and engage in all kind of clearly extractive and malicious activities which cannot be prevented by the review process without creating a large amount of double standards and basically making a bad name for Gitcoin. We are working towards the protocol future though and a small round in GR16 would make a lot of sense. I love @DisruptionJoe 's view on running a two round GR16 which would allow everyone to learn more while preserving the ethos of Gitcoin. In my POV not running a round will clearly kill the \u201chype\u201d around Gitcoin and  after personally talking with over 1000 grant creators myself I think that I have a real sense of what people want from Gitcoin and they want funding, excitement and to continue buidling. In the end I\u2019m sure the best option will be chosen in the end because I trust the DAOs collective brain power   Congratulations everyone! ",

                    "content": "This is a phenomenal discussion and makes a lot of our implicit protocol transition much more explicit \u2013 thanks so much @J9leger and team for the thoughtfulness and clarity put into this writeup. Initially, I was very much pro-Option 1 \u2013 put our money where our mouth is, and go all-in protocol. But as I read through the responses and think through things further, a couple things strike me that push me to try and get a bit creative here. The two main consideration points making me doubt my initial support for Option 1 are:   @juanna\u2019s point on timeframe here - the round is less than two months away; if we\u2019ve already set expectatations with lots of funders that GR16 is happening, rugging it completely does feel a bit late. My further thinking on timing, and your callout of the main risk under Option 1 \u2013 that even with a pause (Option 1), the protocol is still not ready and we lose further credibility. Now through January just may not be enough time to move the needle on protocol advancement, even with 100% focus.  As a result, I would propose an \u201cOption 3\u201d: Run a \u201cMain Round Only\u201d GR16 and GR17. Based on my experience running grants programs over the past year, my finger-in-the-air assessment is that this would reduce operational complexity by about 80% vs. running our usual rounds. There\u2019s still work to be done \u2013 but it\u2019s much more manageable from every angle (CLR setup, policy, grant review, marketing, payouts\u2026 all of it). Adding any sort of cause or ecosystem rounds - even if it\u2019s just two or three - substantially increases complexity and distracts from focus. So, personally, I would err towards setting the expectation now that we run two really bare bones rounds that are still the Gitcoin Grants everyone knows & loves on the familiar quarterly cadence, keeping the program alive but giving the team the next six months to focus on protocol in a much more dedicated fashion. This would probably require an interim re-definition of the \u201cMain Round\u201d and what\u2019s in for these two special rounds in GR16 & GR17 (IMO, it should be pretty broad and include all the archteypes of ecosystem/cause round grantees that have been on the platform prior). Pros of my Option 3 proposal:  Maintains familiar quarterly cadence, grantees still get funding ~80% less work than status quo (And six months of this \u2018downtime\u2019 vs. three) A new opportunity to test quadratic funding in its purest form in the context of just a main round - how do all the climate, DeSci, etc. grantees that we\u2019ve garnered in the last couple rounds now stack up funding-wise in absence of dedicated rounds?  Cons of my Option 3 proposal:  This still kind of sucks for any funders who were hoping to fund a specific cause or ecosystem round for GR16/GR17 - and, TBD if we could even fundraise sufficiently to make this work (would require a re-framing of expectations/offerings with partners, but I think it\u2019s doable) Doesn\u2019t give the team the 100% protocol focus that Option 1 gives  Lastly, I will say that if a proposal like the Option 3 I\u2019ve outlined isn\u2019t workable or worth considering for whatever reason, my strong support would be for Option 1 over Option 2. I really think we\u2019re kidding ourselves if we think we can run any form of Ecosystem/Cause Rounds and ramp up the focus on the protocol to where it needs to be. ",

As a long time grantee with rotki I would of course want there to be a GR16 on December as for us and other opensource projects which rely on gitcoin to function, quarterly repetition is key for our revenue. On the other hand I am a gitcoin steward and a developer and I do know that being pulled in two directions as a team (both trying to do GR16 and launch v2) you end up doing nothing. So I do realize there is a need for you guys to focus on delivering v2 and that should be a top priority. So though it would hurt the project I work on I believe it would be the best choice to give the gitcoin product team the time needed to focus so they can deliver a polished v2 version that we can all use properly. TL;DR: I think Option 1 is good as long as v2 comes out nice, polished and ready to use by the community. ",

So I would like to propose an option 3, which is similar (refined) with @annika Gitcoin could have a minimal GR16 with only main round, and without new grantees in GR16. Why I would like to have minimal GR16?  for the grantees who depend on the funds from Gitcoin, it is a disaster. once we break the season GR, could the community trust us ?  So I strongly suggest to have GR16, but with the minimal efforts. I am not the expert in PGF or GPC, but I\u2019d like to invite the core members from different workstreams, to re-consider how to coordinate together to have GR16 successful. If we don\u2019t have chance to have new options, I still support option 1 over option 2. ",

If not, plz ignore. If so, here goes\u2026 I am SUPER EXCITED about the prospect of Gitcoin Program on the Protocol.  I would like to officially request my place in line as a partner (FrontierDAO) as I already have plans to run one of these QFs. They are an amazing magic formula. The fact that you are open sourcing this and sharing it with the rest of the world in an even bigger way is truly admirable.  That Non-profits, DAOs, cities and even states can use this QF formula for fundraising could, in all truth, really disrupt how fundraising and esp. crowdfunding is perceived and how it helps grassroots communities.  Disruption for Public Good LoL. So, while selfishly I am all in on GR16 should you run a smaller round that includes DeSci and CS, I thoroughly understand how much of a toll this must take on the team. It is a massive effort, no doubt about it. Plus, it is end of year holidays. And there is much to be said for regeneration and rejuvenation, something we don\u2019t get much of here in Web3 world. As for denting the Gitcoin brand. As a noobie to Gitcoin, I recognize you have die-hard loyalists so none of us (I\u2019m already a loyalist, in such awe of what you guys have accomplished!) a 3- 6 month break won\u2019t harm your brand.   If it turns into a year, people might start to question\u2026 As a professional in different spaces (comms, Science, Engineering, NGOs, public-private partnerships, etc.) I have made several attempts to communicate about QF to diverse groups. And am realizing it is something that needs to be experienced before it is thoroughly understood. People understand Crowdfunding, but until you have watched your 100 donations of 1 DAI each mushroom into a few $KK, it\u2019s not something that is readily intuitive for most of us who are \u2018scarcity economics\u2019 conditioned, rather than \u2018abundance economics\u2019 conditioned. That said, whatever you choose as a DAO community will be in ultimate service to the rest of us. So I believe you will have the full support from the ecosystem whatever choice ends up being the best/ most wellness-serving, for you. And last thought (a bit of a shill) if you could use or want some help on the PR about your Gitcoin Program on the Protocol, I\u2019d love to work with you on that.  This is truly a magic wand of grassroots funding that you are gifting to people/the world. It will be very important that people understand its potential, its value and its use cases.  On that note, it would be fun to hear this (above) conversation on a Twitter Spaces. At present, this development of Gitcoin Protocol is just being whispered about in Discord DAO communities. So it could be fascinating to hear you guys actually hash it out on a Spaces. Always good to hear the human side of things, in my mind\u2026 Thank you Namaste You are all Heroes! ",

For example a community of grantees of DEI/Impact/DeSci/Open gaming projects exists in Telegram and we could help with such a projects, maybe other grantees from other rounds could be interested as well Actually I was among the compainers. The only real thing that I\u2019ve missed as a grantee - a feedback about my form to add DeSci project. It could be overcome with:  Automatic email Help of communities with status updates  ",

Thank you  Gitcoin has made it possible for me and many others I know to work full-time on using web3 to address climate change, biodiversity collapse and social injustice. Thanks to @M0nkeyFl0wer and Jon Ruth for bringing this topic to my attention! Happy to chime in.  Postponing GR16 to focus on launching a decentralized version of the protocol  in Q1 / Q2 would pose some major challenges to the 300+ projects in our community. Also, as many have mentioned, would create risks for Gitcoin as well. From my experience, shipping production-grade software always takes 2-3x longer than expected, and complex systems are best evolved incrementally over time. Sunsetting legacy software systems is also best done incrementally over time. Turning the lights out all at once can have major unintended consequences. Yes, cGrants has a painful UX, and requires significant human resources from the Gitcoin community. I sense a lot of users have complained recently and that\u2019s adding an additional burden. But the question is: Would grantees rather have UX pain with funding? OR no UX pain and no funding?  I\u2019m sure the community would accept the UX pain and rally behind the human-resource intensive tasks if it meant they could still get funding. The reality is the platform works and it\u2019s being used at scale. Gitcoin just ratified an incredible $4.3M of funding to over 1000 projects. A disruption to the quarterly rhythm would hurt early-stage projects, and communities with lower income and founders from the global south, the same people who are getting hit worst by all the problems we feel so drawn to solve\u2026 At an individual level: there are several founders I\u2019ve recruited personally from  communities with low-income who are planning to participate in GR16 that would be negatively affected by a major delay. My proposal would be to incrementally sunset the centralized grants platform across GR16 and GR17 with a clear roadmap of what aspects are being phased out over a 6-9 month period. Make the announcement early and give the community time. Run a few events across timezones to make sure the info gets out far and wide. A possible roadmap could be:  Run GR16 in December (a main round and three cause rounds (Climate, DeSci, DEI)) Open a short window of grant applications in November for both GR16 and GR17 (mark a hard line) Invite partners who are interested in running Grants Protocol instances to onboard contributors for vetting these applications Run GR17 in late Q1 / Q2 2023 with no new grant applications and no new user accounts. During GR17 spin out 1-2 rounds under the grants protocol for any new applications or any new donors.  You could plan to have GR17 happen 4 or 5 months after GR16 to buy a bit of extra time as well. If people know well in advance, it\u2019s less of a reputationchallenge. Regarding the resourcing, I don\u2019t know all the details but here are some thoughts: a. Can you turn off any functionality that\u2019s causing bugs and drawing engineers away from Grants Protocol? b. Can you significantly reduce marketing for GR16? (let your community do it for you) c. Can Gitcoin Passport become a requirement? d. Can you make \u2018donate to matching pool\u2019 default to drive more funding and easy partnerships burden? e. Can users donate to a Gitcoin Grants Protocol grant to drive more funding? f. Can we run a campaign to onboard more grant reviewers and fraud detectors? (ReFi DAO and several other ReFi communities would be keen to help, I\u2019m sure) Above all, I think the communications piece is the most important one to get right: a. Post a tweet from with a poll of the options available b. Link to this post and invite further conversation c. Set a final deadline for making a decision on GR16 d. Create a public roadmap for rolling out Grants Protocol & sunsetting cGrants For background: We\u2019ve been building an entire ecosystem on top of Gitcoin\u2019s quarterly grant rounds assuming this quarterly cadence will continue (as it has done for almost 4 years). We have invested significant resources in recruiting founders, mentors and investors to make the most of GR16 with a special focus on DEIJ as the heart of regeneration. We\u2019re also building a ReFi Passport on top of Gitcoin Passport to create a  coordination layer for planet positive behaviors on-chain. Our plan is to support 80-100 founders across climate, DEI and DeSci rounds in an 8-week program leading up to GR16. We\u2019d like to donate $7k to the DEI match funding pool to give back and enable diverse founders to experience the power of quadratic funding. That being said, we\u2019d support any decision the Gitcoin community made and want to partner long-term to fund public goods and scale climate solutions with inclusion at heart. Big  to Gitcoin devs, stewards, volunteers and everyone who makes this QF magic possible. It really is magic.  ",

Not only is the grants platform a critical funding mechanism for public goods, but this is one of the most important communities in web3. The vibes, the heart, and the passion for public goods flow into the rest of crypto. I am both a grantee and a grant reviewer on @M0nkeyFl0wer \u2018s team. The funding from Gitcoin has helped me to work full-time in this space this year. It has also helped fund several solar projects in Uganda. I began working on Ben\u2019s team between GR14 & GR15. Helping the cause rounds team gave me a new appreciation for all the work that goes into the grant rounds. Canceling the round with only 6wks between now and GR16 would be a disaster. This will look bad to existing grantees and many who plan to submit grants (particularly in the DEI round). If this was the plan, it should have been communicated weeks, if not months, ago. I believe canceling will have a huge reputational impact on Gitcoin. As noted in many of the comments, many projects depend on this funding. I fully respect the amount of work it will take to run GR16, and I understand the desire to push all of the DAO\u2019s energy to the new platform, but there has to be a win-win, and canceling the round is not it. As suggested by others, I would like to see a smaller round run with the main round and three cause rounds (climate, DeSci, DEI). I won\u2019t speak for all of the cause rounds teams, but I, for one, am willing to work to help make this happen. I also agree with others that there be an early cutoff for grants and that the community can do most of the marketing to lower the burden on the core teams. Regardless of the decision, I think it is essential to get the word out that this discussion is happening so that the wider community can comment and be heard before making a final decision. ",

Thank you @J9leger After reading this post, I became tentatively supportive of Option 1 because I think it\u2019s better to focus on nailing the next version of Grants instead of being pulled in the other direction so hard it slows progress. However my biggest concern, shared by many others I see posting, is that not having a GR16 in December will upset the financial runway of projects relying on Gitcoin. But I wasn\u2019t sure how many projects actually rely on Gitcoin as a consistent and significant source of quarterly funding. There is intense variability among the over 1k+ grantees we get each round. I took a look at the data from the last year (rounds 12 to 15) to see if I could answer: how many grantees raise at least $X thousand from gitcoin every round? Over 5K every round: 18 Over 10K every round: 12 Over 20K every round: 6 Over 50K every round: 2 Of the grantees who raised at least 5k in every round during the last year, the average total yearly raised was $206k and the median was $190k. There is great variability from round to round with one grantee going from raising over 400k in one round to less than 10k the next. This is why the average is so high despite these being a small number of grants raised over 50k every round. These results indicate there is a small, but important, number of grantees who do rely on Gitcoin as a somewhat steady and significant source of funding. These grantees are significant and (by virtue of their QF results) well-liked members of our community. However, this does not consider what other funding sources these projects may have. Still, I think it could erode trust we have built over time with Grantees (and their supporters) if we were to rug them by not holding any round without greater advance warning. I also asked: how many grantees raised over 5k in X of the last 4 rounds? 3 or more of 4 rounds: 56 (Average Yearly Fund: 136k, Median: 113k) 2 or more of 4 rounds: 141 (Average Yearly Fund: 86k, Median: 53k) After seeing these results, my suggestion would be in-line with what others raised above about an Option 3: hold a single, stream-lined, and curated round during GR16. I would include only grantees who have raised at least 5k in 2 of the last 4 rounds. This smaller pool of grantees who have already been vetted will significantly reduce resource strain as they should not require reviews. There is also a question underlying these results but tangential to this conversation: Why does funding change so much from round to round for some grantees? can/should we enable more consistent funding? The variability experienced by grantees is significant although it still allows them to raise large sums over time. ",

If this vote is successful, we will begin preparing for a protocol-driven, streamlined and tightly-scoped GR16.  GR16 Option 3 Gitcoin will run a streamlined alpha round on the protocol in mid-January 2023 for our oldest running rounds: Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, and Climate. Each round will run with a subset of existing grantees to ensure those that rely on us for funding and have helped make a significant impact in the ecosystem continue receiving support (refer to @umarkhaneth analysis above for more details on data about our grantees), that we have the capacity to provide support during the transition, and that we are able to work with the community to intentionally receive feedback and build out operational services to support scaling future rounds soon. This option takes into account the desire to run a streamlined round in GR16, not lose momentum, and ensure when we launch at scale in early Q2, 2023 on the protocol that it is more stable and reliable for grantees, both technically and operationally. In addition we will be running a number of design partner rounds between now and the full protocol launch in early Q2, 2023 that will provide both partners and grantees with opportunities to engage with our grants protocol. While we\u2019re always optimizing for impact, it\u2019s sometimes important to make short term trade-offs - progress is not often linear. Rather than run a sub-par GR16 on c-grants or risk going too big too soon with the protocol, we\u2019ve opted to make tradeoffs to ensure long term growth and sustainability for Gitcoin Grants, our partners and our grantees. We\u2019re optimistic that this approach will help hundreds of additional communities fund their shared needs, and thousands of new grantees get the sustainable funding they need. Stay tuned for more details and communications about next steps.  Additional Summary of Findings In the interest of full transparency, here are some of the key points from the community: Gitcoin grantees survey responses suggest we should prioritize the protocol transition 40 grantees responded to a survey that went out to all GR15 grantees about what they wanted to see for GR16 and majority would be supportive of the option we\u2019re positioning (see data from responses below). To the question: \u201cHow would you react if we shifted GR16 to focus on a successful protocol launch in Q1, 2023 instead?\u201d   51% said they would prefer if you ran a small round with only a few key causes in GR16 and delayed the protocol launch   23% would be excited about and support the prioritization around the protocol   8% said they would be upset and leave the Gitcoin community if we don\u2019t run GR16   18% said they were not sure    Summary of differing opinions and how the option detailed above addresses these perspectives Keep the current format until we\u2019re sure of protocol stability Some expressed reasonable concerns and cautionary anecdotes about leaving the current c-grants platform too soon. We\u2019re cautiously optimistic, but want to make consistent, reliable, and incremental progress. Run something streamlined vs nothing at all It is clear that the majority would like us to run a round in GR16 to continue supporting our core community and not lose momentum, all while realizing the risk of potential protocol delays. Many recognize the tension between running a round on c-grants and how that pulls us in a different direction to where our priorities lie: successfully bringing a new version of grants to life. Run all or no grant rounds for GR16 A few of you suggested that we would impact the community if we did a selective round and should either do the full round or nothing at all. We believe in concavity \u2013 the best policy decisions are often somewhere in the middle. In addition, we are hard at work putting in plan an approach to support our extended grantee community even if it isn\u2019t in the traditional grants round capacity. Don\u2019t run a grants round and spend the time focusing on protocol launch Similarly, there were a few people who suggested going with option 1, to ensure our focus was on the potential future benefits to new grantees and not existing ones. We believe this approach allows us to take care of both. Run a round with community support We appreciate the few cause round grantees who volunteered to involve the community to help run GR16. It\u2019s hard to solicit help for the centralized platform. When we launch the protocol, we\u2019ll be able to decentralize grant rounds further and look to our community to help us run rounds and make a larger impact than we could with just a small internal team. We\u2019re excited to get to start bringing this future to life and involve more of our community in our program design.  Once again, I can\u2019t thank you all enough for your engagement in this discussion and your feedback. We\u2019re excited to keep building the future of funding communities shared needs with all of you. ",

That said, as per my original post, I think shutting off the grants round to jump into the future was risky for reasons that we didn\u2019t understand completely; otherwise - these reasons wouldn\u2019t have been risks. I hope we work to learn more to derisk our transition, for eg focusing on:  protocol delivery - although we currently have experienced and motivated engineers and product folks in Gitcoin afaik the team is saying the process has not converged yet, for eg points are not predictive; i.e. we cannot look at history to predict when code will be delivered on time and on quality community-centric self-adoption - DevRel isn\u2019t something that can easily be bolted onto an organization that has a somewhat insular culture & that is relatively unfamiliar with being self-adopted by technical users GTC utility and value - at some point the ongoing decline in the value of GTC could impact our ability to execute our transition or pivot  Organizations grow in value in large part IMO by identifying & addressing risks to their success.  We have all the ingredients to address these and other risks and opportunities.  Hopefully, we can use some of the breathing room gained by this proposal to build a more solid foundation. ",

Is money the only data input to be considered? Why should 5 K be the bottom line for vetting a project is trustworthy? There are projects that have participated in at least 3 rounds but may not have raised that much due to different factors such as the Polygon network having problems, or not having the traction that others had due to its marketing strategies, influencers, and so on. What about those projects that are relying on GR and that are in an early stage? If these projects do not have the chance to participate they most likely will be killed. My suggestion is: Take the number of rounds participating and the promised delivered value of the project. These factors are way more important than raised money to distinguish those projects that are building public good from those not. Excited to see the decentralized platform happening. It will enable new ways of funding the commons. Also, looking forward to Option 3 hopefully considering my suggestion. Blessings to all, and thanks for the great work you\u2019ve put into making QF and the social movement of GR. ",

If you\u2019re opposed to this suggestion, our other consideration is running GR16 in December in a smaller / more manageable capacity.   Agree with this, launching the new protocol with a splash and great set of first core and cause rounds in Q1 sounds great. One thing I haven\u2019t fully understood yet is how the user experience for donors would be different within the new protocol. I think one of the biggest values of Gitcoin is having a quarterly schelling point for the community to donate easily in one go to a range of initiatives, including cause rounds. In my opinion, it\u2019s important that the user experience is maintained and that all rounds run at the same time, with all donations being collected in one basket\u2026  cc @kevin.olsen @J9leger ",

In GR15 and before, we have seen that there are pretty strong clusters (preferences expressed in donor behavior) between certain rounds, but not a lot of overlap with others. You\u2019re right that cause rounds see a lot of cross-donation, but this doesn\u2019t play out in the data across the whole of the Gitcoin Grants program. This is an active discussion in the DAO on how to balance the value of Gitcoin Grants Rounds as a Schelling-point with the ops burden (and the degraded user experience) of running so many rounds in parallel. One concept I\u2019m bullish on is reframing our program as a Grants Season with cross-community clusters running concurrently, but not necessarily all clusters of rounds in the program running on the same schedule.  Beyond helping to reduce the ops burden needed to support dozens of parallel rounds. This will help us target our outreach and messaging to different audiences, allow for tuning the levels of sybil and fraud prevention for different communities, and provide a hypothetical benefit of values-coherent communities driving better fund allocation through their participation in QF round-clusters.

I\u2019d be curious to hear how other people in the community feel about this. There isn\u2019t a lot of diversity in terms of the representation of the core holders either, which probably helps explain why the consensus leaned so strongly in the direction it did\u2026 If Gitcoin is pushing hard to decentralize their software infrastructure at the expense of funding founders from marginalized communities, I would encourage an open dialogue about building a more diverse representation of token holders who are incentivized to actively participate in governance and strategic direction. Gitcoin provides a critical stream of funding for hundreds of projects creating positive externalities. Would love to see some of the diverse leaders in these communities gaining ownership in Gitcoin and having a vested interest in it\u2019s success. I\u2019m sure this conversation has been catalyzed elsewhere and is being deeply considered, so apologies if it is redundant! Lots of love Gitcoin fam   image1220\u00d7574 57.9 KB  ",
