We spent a total of $51,057.67 in February, running over the average monthly forecasted figure of $42,766.66 by $8,291.00, largely due to the ETHDenver team offsite that cost $7,502.93 and payment for legal services, both of which are non-recurring expenses. Total funds received to date: $289,839.47 Actuals incurred through Feb 22: $264,170.22  Budget Proposals in RFC We\u2019ve continued talking to stakeholders about our two budget proposals in RFC; SP62 & SP63. SP62 is the \u201cbase proposal\u201d. It includes;  Higher contributor compensation budget. Higher event sponsorship budget. Salary adjustments to account for annual raises. Some housekeeping fixes to include a budget for employer taxes and our legal spend.   869\u00d7458 22 KB  SP63 includes one additional larger item, a full-time hire of a Public Relations Project Manager Here\u2019s a short video making a case for the hire:      874\u00d7454 22.3 KB   Program Updates The Stakeholder News and Reports Drive folder now contains a Vision, Mission, and Strategy document.  Weekly Relay The Weekly Relays have been published as usual. The Weekly Relay Drive folder now contains an overview of the publication, which includes its mission, OKRs, roadmap, and process documentation.  State of Dai We are considering ways to expand coverage to vault user behavior analysis. If you are interested in contributing to this, reach out to @Artem_Gordon.  Forum at a Glance Forum at a Glance is now published by EOD on Wednesdays instead of Thursday mornings. We\u2019ve been pushing them out as usual.  Monthly Governance Review Will be released on Friday, April 1, 2022.  Monthly Core Unit Updates Expect March\u2019s publication to be released on April 4, 2022.  Metrics New content analytics data such as average reading time, engagement ratio, platform media click-throughs, and optimal posting time have become accessible. This data is now being tracked for all Stakeholder Program Content on Twitter, Reddit, and Medium. For additional information, check out the Media Platform Analytics Process document.  Initiatives Tracking, Reporting, & Stakeholder Alignment Calls A new Resiliency initiative has entered the arena that focuses on improving MakerDAO\u2019s financial and operational resilience, making it more \u201crecession-proof\u201d, working on organizational resiliency milestones in partnership with Recognized Delegates . Check out an overview of the new initiative from the 182nd Governance & Risk Call. The initiative features a focus on:  Longer-term planning (9+ months) Staying on course with contingency add-ons Minimum Viable Operations as a first principle Supporting a budget-neutral scenario Temaining flexible with scaling parameters. Transparency & accountability Role of delegates Governance evaluation & feedback tools  Join the #resilience-stakeholder-alignment channel on Discord. Progress continues to be made on the CMON, CMOFF, and SEC initiatives. Meanwhile, PE-001 continues to successfully employ the framework for the L2 initiative. In the coming weeks, we will be handing off CMOFF facilitation to @Retro who has been preparing to take on the role. Similarly, CMON will be handed off to @thomas.flitter, who has also been preparing to take on the role.  Public Calendars No major updates here. Calls Votes & Important Dates  Stakeholder Database We are continuing to work with TechGDPR to bring this project into a state of GDPR compliance. They recently completed their Assessment Report providing us with a list of 27 recommended actions to bring us up to code over the course of the next 3 quarters.  Issue Discussion Calls @thomasf is planning our next issue discussion call for March 30th, covering the Budget Update process. Check out the forum thread for more information.  Emergency Playbook After receiving some key feedback from mandated actors we have shifted our approach regarding incident role assignments. Instead of having assignments, roles will be assigned as needed in the event of an incident. There is so much variability in the type of incident that assigning static roles to people is an inefficient tactic. Instead, whoever is available must determine who is the best person to stand in as the immediate Incident Manager who can then assign roles as needed. In partnership with Immunifi Security Core Unit, we\u2019ve begun working on an Emergency Playbook workshop that teaches members of MakerDAO the various incident roles and procedures to follow in the event of an incident.  Press Relations Support We are continuing to advocate for a Press Release program as our SP63 budget proposal remains in RFC. Assuming our mandate renewal and budget proposal passes in April, we will be clear to start hiring for a full-time Public Relations PM in May 2022. In the meantime, we are continuing to provide the same level of basic service.  Communication Platform Stewardship No major updates from the last two weeks.
