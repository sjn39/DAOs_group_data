Also - muscle flexing vids on PSM, Keg, Optimism Dai Bridge and Liq. 2.0. You can make the one on Liq 2.0 in advance but wait with the upload until the system is proof tested by a severe market downturn for maximum effect. Tell everyone and their mother how much profit we are making - we seriously need to pump harder. NB. Please be aware of and take into account that content production like this is usually not Core in normal companies. These are services that are hired when needed. I see you have already taken the step (good) to setup as a Delaware company, which over the next couple of years could allow you to transition out to be a defi content specialist company not relying entirely on Maker. I fully support your effort and wish you the best. ",

After considering the responses, we\u2019re making minor changes to the budget and want to clarify our response to some of the questions that came up. Why aren\u2019t we committing to more content up-front? Our main concern about committing to publishing content too soon is due to our lack of clarity around what we need to consider to make sure we\u2019re not characterizing MakerDAO in ways that are legally problematic. I\u2019ve raised this concern with @layerzero, who\u2019s working on a proposal for a Legal Core Unit and am prepared to get the answers we need from outside council if this is an issue the team isn\u2019t able to address. What content will we be publishing from day 1? As long as there aren\u2019t any major concerns, we plan to continue contributing to the written version of Maker Relay, developing the audio version Jerry created a pilot for through CommDev, and publishing content in the (soon to be public) Community Blog, including profiles for the Humans of MakerDAO series. Does our budget allocate enough money for salaries? I made a mistake in saying our budget considered salaries for the Video Lead and Writers for two months - the budget we\u2019ve proposed only covers them for the final month but I do think it\u2019s better to start that process sooner rather than later so we\u2019ve increased our budget. We\u2019re happy to address any other concerns and are looking forward to Formal Submission! ",
