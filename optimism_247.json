We appreciate all the detailed feedback that we received. The following key changes were implemented in the proposal:  Removal of the partner incentive program & reduction of the token amounts requested (100k \u2192 50k). Change of the token distribution. Instead of converting the entirety of the usage incentive OP grant to ETH before airdropping it, we propose a 70:30 OP:ETH mixed airdrop, incentivizing involvement into the OP ecosystem as well as getting DAO users set up to transact on Optimism More details on the DAO use cases were added Updated KPI and impact tracking to include more granular KPIs are suggested by the tooling committee.  I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes L2 recipient address: 0x2696170bf5fD36320c3932fd9e85fe5b798385FE Grant category: Governance Fund Phase 1 Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee? The Tooling Committee Project description: Otterspace is building a flexible and easy-to-use infrastructure for DAOs to use non-transferable NFTs, which we call Badges. Badges can enable DAOs to perform non-financialized governance, automate permissions (access rights, etc.), manage community-specific reputation/credentials, and create better incentive systems. Currently, we are in our private Beta with 16+ DAO partners, including Radicle, Bankless DAO, Token Engineering Academy, OurNetwork, and Syndicate, amongst others, and our product is deployed on Optimism Mainnet. We are co-authoring a token standard specifically for non-transferable tokens (EIP 4973), and are building an open protocol that utilizes the standard and an application that is in service of the protocol. Today, Badge collections can be designed and manually assigned by a DAO admin to members in the DAO through our easy-to-use app interface. Badges can have expiration dates and artwork specific to the DAOs use case. DAOs can also interact directly with the protocol if they prefer to develop their own front-end. The four key use cases that we see from our work with the private beta participating DAOs are:  Governance (e.g., supporting Radicle DAO\u2019s distribution of influence, wherein RAD tokens will be delegated to Badge holders to distribute governance influence within the DAO) Community membership & engagement (e.g., the Bankless DAO season passes, Our Network) Access management (e.g., token-gating Discord or documents based on Badge ownership - we are working on this with Guild at the moment, but also including other integrations such as Wonderverse, Coordinape, etc.) Education & credentials (e.g., issuing Badges to record course completion as intended by Token Engineering Academy & Token Engineering Commons)  You can preview the current version of our product in our product deck & this product demo video. Soon Badges can be earned by completing missions based on meeting on-/off-chain conditions (e.g., have bought token X before, participated in governance, etc.).

Previously also Co-Founder/CTO of music Web3 startup https://paperchain.io/   Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: As Otterspace, we are currently helping Radicle DAO in the distribution of influence process and providing the non-transferable token technical backbone as part of a Radicle grant. Other examples include Bankless DAO, which plans to use Badges to represent season passes for its community members; Token Engineering Academy, which plans to issue Badges to its students for the completion of courses and study programs; or Syndicate DAO, which plans to issue Badges to its investment syndicate users for achieving certain milestones. On an individual level, the team members have been active in multiple past projects, such as, for example, Emily being the community lead at SharkDAO, where she implemented a new onboarding process, and at Cabin DAO where she led a Discord revamp; or Rahul as the Co-founder and CTO of https://paperchain.io/. Relevant usage metrics: In the first iteration of the Otterspace product (which contained off-chain Badges at the time) more than 15,000 Badges were created across 9 DAOs in only three months. The current Badge protocol and app are the second iteration of our product, bringing Badges on-chain. We recently started onboarding DAOs onto the new product and are currently working with 16 DAOs in our private Beta. Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): The use cases for non-transferable tokens (NTTs) are abundant, and various organizations are developing NTTs. Similar projects to Otterspace include, for example, MintKudos, which specializes in capturing atomic community contributions on-chain; Rep3 aims to capture on-chain reputation and contribution payments via non-transferable tokens; Noox enables the minting of achievements (predominantly in the DeFi space) on-chain. We believe that the various use cases of NTTs merit specialized solutions and are excited to see multiple organizations pursuing the spread and adoption of this primitive. Nevertheless, our focus differs from the projects mentioned above. In our opinion, other projects in the space tend to focus more on measuring atomic/high-frequency contributions. At the same time, we see ourselves leaning towards higher utility & assurance/lower-frequency use cases. With regard to Optimism specifically, we consider ourselves the most relevant partner at this point as we are Optimism native and based on the NTT-specific token standard EIP-4973 as opposed to the modified ERC-721/ERC-1155s utilized by various similar projects. Is/will this project be open-sourced? The Otterspace Protocol is being developed as an open set of smart contracts so that DAOs can compose and integrate pieces into their own tech stack and other app developers can construct custom front-ends. The protocol and code are visible on our Github under https://github.com/otterspace-xyz, and you can read our technical documentation here. Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 17th of August, 2022 Ecosystem Value Proposition: What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? The current method of distributing influence in DAOs, often based on fungible token ownership, is problematic because power consolidates in the hands of whales, which runs counter to the philosophy of many DAOs. Optimism itself is planning to counter such a setting via the bicameral governance system from the get-go. Contributors earning their \u2018salaries\u2019 in tokens end up selling their influence to cover expenses. Further, the distribution of permissions is also problematic, as it requires manual management. The frequent turnover in DAOs creates overhead for adding and removing permissions from individuals. How does your proposal offer a value proposition for solving the above problem? Badges address these issues by enabling non-financial governance, balancing out the fungible token-based governance systems, as intended by Optimism\u2019s bicameral governance system. Additionally, Badges are especially powerful because they can have utility attached to them \u2013 Otterspace is collaborating with multiple DAO tooling providers to integrate the Badges across the DAO tooling landscape. Badges can be used for governance (e.g., Snapshot), access permissions (e.g., Clarity, Guild), payments (e.g. Coordinape), and more. Additionally, Badges are useful simply to show off reputation, history, and experience. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? The benefits of this collaboration for Optimism are threefold (which are not mutually exclusive): (i) The Otterspace protocol, app, and token standard (EIP-4973) can facilitate & speed up the building of the Optimism Citizen House by providing its technical backbone. Badges could be used to indicate membership and decision-making in the Citizen House (e.g., through our Snapshot integration). Thereby, Badges benefit the long-term & efficient growth of the Optimism ecosystem. Additionally, we have been working on governance-related Badge implementations with other DAOs (e.g., Radicle\u2019s distribution of influence workstream). We could assist Optimism in the conceptual design of the Citizen House. (ii) As an Optimism-first protocol, we want to partner with you to spur further growth of the Optimism ecosystem, especially within the DAO segment. This segment so far has not received much funding from the community compared to DeFi. This has two aspects:  We are working with many DAOs who are not yet on Optimism and could become long-term Optimism enablers. Through our easy-to-use interface (familiar to Web2 users), we are introducing Optimism on-ramps into our product which will onboard more users into the broader Optimism ecosystem.  (iii) Lastly, we believe that the newly founded Governance Committees could make use of an internal coordination mechanism that utilizes Otterspace Badges. Badges could, for example, be used within a Snapshot strategy to achieve consensus on how to vote on proposals within committees. Additionally, the Badges could delineate membership within the Governance Committee (e.g., Badges for the DeFi Committee). Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? Yes, in cycle 6 Number of OP tokens requested: 50,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: Not applicable Proposal for token distribution: How will the OP tokens be distributed? The tokens will be used to incentivize user adoption of Otterspace and Optimism. We aim to achieve this by airdropping a mix of OP & ETH to new users to their Optimism wallet after they have been added to a Badge allow list (e.g., after a Token Engineering Academy student has completed their first course and will receive the completion certificate, or a new Bankless user receiving their first season pass). What is the mix and why? 70% OP and 30% ETH (in total $1-3 per wallet). The OP share is intended to increase users awareness & involvement in the Optimism ecosystem. The ETH share is intended as a catalyst to cover the initial gas fees of interacting on Optimism. We acknowledge the \u201cno sale\u201d rule outlined in the Grant Proposal Template and refer to the third sub-point \u201cDoes not include using OP to incentivize usage.\u201d  arguing that this selling of a small share of the token grant and thereby getting users started for gas fees has a significant positive effect on adoption (e.g., the minting of an Otterspace Badge has small gas fee due to the consensual minting mechanism of EIP-4973). Consider that if users were to receive only OP in their new Optimism wallet, they would not be able to interact with the OP, Otterspace, or other applications until they bridged additional ETH from L1, which can present a challenge for less crypto-native users. Additionally, we also consider that this mix can aid the education of new users, for example, by encouraging them to learn about governance and delegation, which we will encourage as part of the airdrop program. How many users do we expect to onboard this way? This allocation would enable us to onboard 15-40k users to Optimism directly over the next 12 months and provide them with enough funds to mint their first Badge and experiment with additional transactions on Optimism. The number of users depends on the speed of DAO adoption and the adoption of Badges for different use cases. Higher frequency use cases (such as tracking atomic contributions) may bring more users with potentially less retention. In contrast, higher utility use cases (such as Badges for permission management) may bring fewer users but with higher retention. Both are beneficial to the Optimism ecosystem. As Badges are still a recent concept, Otterspace will incentivize all use cases and optimize to offer the best solutions to DAOs\u2019 needs. By enabling Badge owners within a community to also create and distribute additional Badges, their adoption can grow organically and use case agnostic within communities. How will we avoid airdrop farming? This drop would apply to future users that get added to a Badge\u2019s allow list (only once per wallet and for the first time after this drop mechanism is live). As DAOs may create multiple Badges within their community (e.g., representing different contributor levels), this might also include users that already claimed a previous Badge at a point in time before the airdrop mechanism is available. Beyond ensuring the safety of the technical implementation, two additional guard rails exist for us: (i) Who gets access to a Badge allow list & airdrop & (ii) how much ETH is exposed at a given time. Who gets access to a Badge allow list & airdrop? During the private beta, we are in touch with all participating DAO representatives, and using Otterspace is subject to going through our onboarding & screening. Therefore, we currently have an influence on who gets access to a Badge allow list as we work with them directly. Once the product is opened for any DAO to use, we will make the airdrop subject to participating in a screening process and approval, wherein we ensure that the users represent the DAOs that they claim to represent. Our product is tailored toward DAO workstream leads and coordinators issuing Badges. These individuals typically would know the individuals to whom they issue Badges, thereby acting as a web of trust. As a provider, we do not plan to prescribe how the Badge distribution should work within communities. Nevertheless, we aim to provide helpful content on how, e.g., Sybil resistance can be addressed and ensured in the distribution mechanism and work with partners that offer Sybil-resistance functionalities which can be integrated into the Badge distribution flows. How much OP & ETH is exposed at a given time? We plan to limit the exposure of OP & ETH. The OP & ETH will be primarily kept in the Otterspace Gnosis Safe, and the contracts that control the airdrop will be \u201ctopped up\u201d periodically to ensure that at any given time, only the token balance necessary to serve the new incoming user base is in the contract and thereby exposed to potential threats. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? The tokens will be distributed over the next 9 to 12 months. How will the impact and success of the campaign be tracked? The KPIs used to track the progress of this initiative will be:  The number of accounts that participated in the airdrop The number of accounts that have claimed a Badge The number of accounts where Badge claiming represented the first Optimism tx The number of DAOs issuing Badges The conversion rate from Badge-claimer to Badge-creator  Additionally, we will publish case studies with select participating DAOs, presenting their Badge implementations. Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? DAO contributors are likely to remain on Optimism after the incentives run dry as they will have built up a collection of Badges representing a share of their on-chain reputation, and the collection may contain multiple Badges with integrations with frequent usage (e.g., Badges used in token gating). DAOs are likely to remain on Optimism as they will have built an on-chain representation of their DAO structure with Badges, and Badges may be used in mission-critical operations (e.g., governance). Thus, moving operational infrastructure to another network would result in considerable friction. ",

Presentation  We are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee, responsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure (wallets, bridges etc.).  2. About the project  Otterspace is building infrastructure for DAOs to issue Badges (soulbound NFTs) based on DAO members\u2019 on & off-chain actions. The idea is that these Badges can help DAOs to perform non-financialized governance, automate permissions (access rights, etc.), manage community-specific reputation/credentials, and create better incentive systems\u2026 The product is in closed-beta right now with a handful of DAO\u2019s actively using Otterspace. External links:  Website: https://www.otterspace.xyz/ 11  Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/otterspace_xyz   Similar OP Governance proposals:   Boardroom - 100K OP tokens   3. About the following  The proposal was detailed and the authors responded to several questions raised around implementation details.  4. About the proposal valuation    Added value (good to bad): good. Otterspace intends to bring some valuable tools for DAOs to the table to rewards its most active members & experiment with more plutocratic voting systems.  Impact or expected usage (high to low): low to medium. There are several projects offering similar functionalities than Otterspace. It remains to be seen whether DAOs will integrate Badges into their workflows and whether this will have a positive impact on DAO operations.  Current Status [Development stage/Open Source?] (early to ready): somewhat ready. For now, they have a functional platform which is being live-tested by a handful of DAO\u2019s. As part of this grant they intend to on-board more DAO\u2019s and eventually open up access to their platform altogether. Their contracts are open-source and they are contributing to an EIP- standard for Soulbound tokens. and several integrations, but developers are encouraged to use the Socket bases for new use cases.  Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate): standard. They intend to airdrop a mix of $ETH and $OP ($1-3) to Badge claimants to make up for incurred gas costs.  Amount requested (high to low): medium**.** After feedback from the Optimism tooling committee the amount is now reasonable.   5. KPIs and impact tracking To track the success of the campaign it would make sense to track:   #accounts with airdropped $ETH  #of accounts that claimed their Badge  #of accounts that did their first Optimism tx claiming their Badge  #of DAO\u2019s issuing Badges a written report with case studies how DAO\u2019s successfully implemented the Badges   6. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Yes We like the problem space Otterspace is solving for and the fact it\u2019s building its infrastructure natively on Optimism. After feedback from the Optimism tooling committee the new grant amount seems reasonable and the distribution plan is clear. ",

I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes L2 recipient address: 0x2696170bf5fD36320c3932fd9e85fe5b798385FE Grant category: Governance Fund Phase 1 Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Tooling Project description: Otterspace is building a flexible and easy-to-use infrastructure for DAOs to use non-transferable NFTs, which we call Badges. Badges can enable DAOs to perform non-financialized governance, automate permissions (access rights, etc.), manage community-specific reputation/credentials, and create better incentive systems. Currently, we are in our private Beta with 16 DAO partners, including Radicle, Bankless DAO, Token Engineering Academy and Syndicate, amongst others and our product is deployed on Optimism Mainnet. We are co-authoring a token standard specifically for non-transferable tokens (EIP 4973), are building an open protocol that utilizes the standard and an application that is in service of the protocol. Today, Badge collections can be designed and manually assigned by a DAO admin to members in the DAO through our easy-to-use app interface. Badges can have expiration dates and artwork specific to the DAOs use case. DAOs can also interact directly with the protocol if they prefer to develop their own front-end. With the Badges, we enable downstream permissions within Snapshot (used for governance), Guild (used for Badge-gating), and additional integrations with various DAO tooling providers (including Wonderverse, Coordinape, etc.). You can preview the current version of our product in our product deck. Soon badges can be earned by completing missions (e.g., by meeting certain on and off-chain requirements), DAOs can view their membership base, and contributors can show off their DAO membership with their own profiles.

Previously also Co-Founder/CTO of music Web3 startup https://paperchain.io/   Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: As Otterspace, we are currently helping Radicle DAO in the distribution of influence process and providing the non-transferable token technical backbone as part of a Radicle grant. Other examples include Bankless DAO, which plans to use Badges to represent season passes for its community members; Token Engineering Academy, which plans to issue badges to it\u2019s students for the completion of courses and study programs; or Syndicate DAO, which plans to issue badges to its investment syndicate users for achieving certain milestones. On an individual level, the team members have been active in multiple past projects, such as, for example, Emily being the community lead at SharkDAO, where she implemented a new onboarding process, and at Cabin DAO where she led a Discord revamp; or Rahul as the Co-founder and CTO of https://paperchain.io/. Relevant usage metrics: In the first iteration of the Otterspace product (which contained off-chain badges at the time) more than 15,000 badges were created across 9 DAOs in only three months. The current Badge protocol and app are the second iteration of our product, bringing badges on-chain. We recently started onboarding DAOs onto the new product and are currently working with 16 DAOs in our private Beta. Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): The use cases for non-transferable tokens (NTTs) are abundant, and various organizations are developing NTTs. Similar projects to Otterspace include, for example, MintKudos, which specializes in capturing atomic community contributions on-chain; Rep3 aims to capture on-chain reputation and contribution payments via non-transferable tokens; Noox enables the minting of achievements (predominantly in the DeFi space) on-chain. We believe that the various use cases of NTTs merit specialized solutions and are excited to see multiple organizations pursuing the spread and adoption of this primitive. Nevertheless, our focus differs from the projects mentioned above. In our opinion, other projects in the space tend to focus more on measuring atomic/high-frequency contributions. At the same time, we see ourselves leaning towards higher utility & assurance/lower-frequency use cases. With regard to Optimism specifically, we consider ourselves the most relevant partner at this point as we are Optimism native and based on the NTT-specific token standard EIP-4973 as opposed to the modified ERC-721/ERC-1155s utilized by various similar projects. Is/will this project be open-sourced? The Otterspace Protocol is being developed as an open set of smart contracts so that DAOs can compose and integrate pieces into their own tech stack and other app developers can construct custom front-ends. The protocol and code are visible on our Github under https://github.com/otterspace-xyz, and you can read our technical documentation here. Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 17th of August, 2022 Ecosystem Value Proposition: What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? The current method of distributing influence in DAOs, often based on fungible token ownership, is problematic because power consolidates in the hands of whales, which runs counter to the philosophy of many DAOs. Optimism itself is planning to counter such a setting via the bicameral governance system from the get-go. Contributors earning their \u2018salaries\u2019 in tokens end up selling their influence to cover expenses. Further, the distribution of permissions is also problematic, as it requires manual management. The frequent turnover in DAOs creates overhead for adding and removing permissions from individuals. How does your proposal offer a value proposition for solving the above problem? Badges address these issues by enabling non-financial governance, balancing out the fungible token-based governance systems, as intended by Optimism\u2019s bicameral governance system. Additionally, Badges are especially powerful because they can have utility attached to them \u2013 Otterspace is collaborating with multiple DAO tooling providers to integrate the badges across the DAO tooling landscape. Badges can be used for governance (e.g., Snapshot), access permissions (e.g., Clarity, Guild), payments (e.g. Coordinape), and more. Additionally, badges are useful simply to show off reputation, history, and experience. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? The benefits of this collaboration for Optimism are threefold (which are not mutually exclusive): (i) The Otterspace protocol, app, and token standard (EIP-4973) can facilitate & speed up the building of the Optimism Citizen House by providing its technical backbone. Badges could be used to indicate membership and decision-making in the Citizen House  (e.g., through our Snapshot integration). Thereby, Badges benefit the long-term & efficient growth of the Optimism ecosystem. Additionally, we have been working on governance-related Badge implementations with other DAOs (e.g., Radicle\u2019s distribution of influence workstream). We could assist Optimism in the conceptual design of the Citizen House. (ii) As an Optimism-first protocol, we want to partner with you to spur further growth of the Optimism ecosystem, especially within the DAO segment. This segment so far has not received much funding from the community compared to DeFi. This has two aspects:  We are working with many DAOs who are not yet on Optimism and could become long-term Optimism enablers. Through our easy-to-use interface (familiar to Web2 users), we are introducing Optimism on-ramps into our product which will onboard more users into the broader Optimism ecosystem.  (iii) Lastly, we believe that the newly founded Governance Committees could make use of an internal coordination mechanism that utilizes Otterspace Badges. Badges could, for example, be used within a Snapshot strategy to achieve consensus on how to vote on proposals within committees. Additionally, the Badges could delineate membership within the Governance Committee (e.g., Badges for the DeFi Committee). Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No Number of OP tokens requested: 100,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: Not applicable Proposal for token distribution: How will the OP tokens be distributed? 70% of the tokens will be used to incentivize user adoption \u2013 We will achieve this by converting OP tokens to Eth and dropping $1-3 worth to the Optimism wallets of users who have been added to a Badge allow list. The creation and claiming of Badges is associated with a small gas fee (due to the consensual minting mechanism of EIP-4973, this gas fee is currently required as Badge recipients need to mint the Badge, thereby consenting to it). By dropping a small amount of ETH into the Badge recipients\u2019 wallets, these users can directly claim their Badges and engage. This benefits Optimism by facilitating the onboarding of new users to L2 directly. In the context of some DAOs, this also means that new Web2 users are likely to interact with Optimism as one of their first experiences in Web3 and, due to the ETH drop, can do so easily. For example, Bankless DAO will be implementing Otterspace Badges as their season pass \u2013 we expect a significant portion of new Bankless members to be new to Web3. With regard to the \u201cno sale\u201d rule we understand this to follow under the third point of the Grant Proposal Template    Grant Proposal Template   Does not include using OP to incentivize usage.   This allocation would enable us to onboard 20-70k users to Optimism directly over the next 12 months and provide them with enough funds to mint their first badge and experiment with a few other transactions on Optimism. The number of users depends on the speed of DAO adoption and the adoption of badges for different use cases. Higher frequency use cases (such as tracking atomic contributions) may bring more users with potentially less retention. In contrast, higher utility use cases (such as badges for permission management) may bring fewer users but with higher retention. Either is beneficial to the Optimism ecosystem. As badges are still a recent concept, Otterspace will incentivize all use cases and optimize to offer the best solutions to DAOs\u2019 needs. By enabling Badge owners within a community to also create and distribute additional Badges, their adoption can grow organically and use case agnostic within communities. To measure our progress towards this goal, we will track metrics such as # of Badges minted, the conversion rate of Badge-minters to Badge-creators & Badge usage in integrations. Badges are distributed by DAO/community admins. For the time being, each DAO is selected to participate in the beta after speaking to the Otterspace team. This way, we ensure an alignment between the DAO\u2019s needs and the capabilities of Otterspace. As a provider, we do not plan to prescribe how the badge distribution should work for communities. Nevertheless, we aim to provide helpful content on how, e.g., Sybil resistance can be addressed and ensured in the distribution mechanism and work with partners that offer Sybil-resistance functionalities and can be integrated into the badge distribution flows. This drop would apply to future users that get added to a Badge\u2019s allow list (only once per wallet and for the first time after this drop mechanism is live). As DAOs may create multiple badges within their community (e.g., representing different contributor levels), this might also include users that already claimed a previous badge at a point in time before the drop mechanism is available. 30% of the tokens will be used to incentivize integration partner adoption \u2013 The Otterspace protocol is a public goods infrastructure that can be used by developers across their applications. This part of the token allocation will be used as an incentive to drive developer adoption of Badges across the Optimism ecosystem for use cases such as governance, permission automation, and gating. This is beneficial to Optimism as (i) a non-transferable token infrastructure with high utility (via integrations) will make Optimism more attractive for existing communities on Optimism & future communities evaluating if they should build on layer 2 directly, and (ii) all integrations with the badge infrastructure will also benefit the Optimism DAO itself (e.g., Citizen token holders). Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? The tokens will be distributed over the next 9 to 12 months. Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? DAO contributors are likely to remain on Optimism after the incentives run dry as they will have built up a collection of Badges representing a share of their on-chain reputation, and the collection may contain multiple badges with integrations with frequent usage (e.g., badges used in token gating). DAOs are likely to remain on Optimism as they will have built an on-chain representation of their DAO structure with Badges, and Badges may be used in mission-critical operations (e.g., governance). Thus, moving operational infrastructure to another network would result in considerable friction. Lastly, given our efforts to incentivize DAO tooling providers to integrate with Otterspace on Optimism, DAOs will find all the DAO tools that they need on Optimism along with the benefits of using them on an L2.

                    "content": "Thanks for the feedback @OPUser @NathanVDH ! The rationale for dropping ETH to the users\u2019 optimism wallets is that the creation and claiming of badges is associated with a small gas fee (due to the consensual minting mechanism of EIP-4973, this gas fee is currently required as Badge recipients need to mint the Badge, thereby consenting to it). By dropping a small amount of ETH to the Badge recipients\u2019 wallets, these users can directly claim their badges and engage. This would be particularly useful for DAOs/communities that are engaging users with a more web2 background, as the process of buying ETH, sending it from an exchange to a wallet, and then bridging it to Optimism ahead of claiming a Badge is more complex compared to simply claiming a badge in your wallet on Optimism directly. As pointed out by @NathanVDH (and please correct me if I misunderstood your comment), this small starting balance would also set these users up to do more transactions on Optimism as they are already onboarded to the network then. This drop would apply to future users that get added to a Badge\u2019s allow list (only once per wallet and for the first time after this drop mechanism is live). As DAOs may create multiple badges within their community (e.g., representing different contributor levels), this might also include users that already claimed a previous badge at a point in time before the drop mechanism is available. We\u2019re interested in your, and the community\u2019s, thoughts on this as well  ",

                    "content": "Thanks, @Defi_LATAM_axlvaz for the question. To clarify, this is how I understand your questions and what I\u2019m responding to (please correct me if I misunderstood part of your question). 1. How will we purchase the ETH? (If you were referring to why we plan to purchase ETH, may I point you to our response above to OPUser\u2019s question?) We consider the following aspects as relevant: the frequency of swapping, the time period over which the swapping will take place and the amount swapped each time. Concerning the frequency and time period, we plan to swap OP into ETH at regular intervals and, therefore, not all at once. As we plan to distribute the tokens over a period of 12 months, we will likely follow a monthly/bi-weekly swapping schedule. In the first months, we will swap less OP into ETH and then increase this monthly swapped amount as the user base grows. This way, we should receive, on average, a reasonable exchange rate without exerting any significant impact on the liquidity or the price of the underlying assets. 2. How are we going to avoid the ETH being farmed in this Airdrop (e.g., programmatically draining the account of ETH)? We consider the following aspects relevant for this question: how the ETH is distributed, who gets access to the badge allow list & airdrop, and how much ETH is exposed at a given time. How the ETH is distributed: Our product & engineering teams are currently looking into the trade-offs associated with either airdropping the tokens, using a relayer contract, or meta transactions, all to enable robust & easy adoption and onboarding of users. At the time of writing, we consider the airdrop to be the best approach. The event triggering an airdrop would be an address added to the badge allow list for the first time and only once per address across all badges. Given this, we believe that beyond ensuring the safety of the technical implementation, two additional control handles exist for us: (i) Who gets access to a badge allow list & airdrop & (ii) how much ETH is exposed at a given time. Who gets access to the badge allow list & airdrop: During our ongoing private Beta, we are personally in touch with representatives of all DAOs using Otterspace, and using Otterspace is subject to going through our onboarding & screening. Therefore, we currently have influence on who gets access to a badge allow list as we work with them directly. Once we open up the product and enable any DAO to start using the app, we will retain a screening process and make the airdrop subject to approval. Any DAO could use Otterspace, but in order to benefit from the Airdrop we would first need to speak to and screen the DAO representatives, to ensure that they represent the DAO that they claim. We would then only enable the airdrop for organizations that we have screened to ensure that only entities that we deem trustworthy have access to airdropped ETH. Our product is tailored towards DAO workstream leads and coordinators issuing badges. These individuals typically would know the individuals to whom they issue badges, thereby acting as a web of trust. How much ETH is exposed at a given time: In addition to ensuring that trustworthy DAO representatives use the badge allow list & the airdrop, we also plan to limit the exposure of ETH. The ETH will be primarily kept in the Otterspace Gnosis Safe, and the contract that controls the airdrop will be \u201ctopped up\u201d periodically to ensure that at any given time, only the ETH amount necessary to serve the new incoming user base is in the contract and thereby exposed to potential threats. This is the working state of our considerations on ensuring the safety and correct allocation of the token grant. We appreciate all feedback on this and will keep the Optimism community updated on our progress as we go (provided the approval of the grant). ",

Concerning Galaxy/Galxe, we differ on the technical and the use case side. Technically, Galxe is using mostly ERC-721 NFTs, which are transferable. However, as far as I\u2019m aware, Galxe are also experimenting with some modified ERC-721s that are non-transferable. Nevertheless, we believe that non-transferable NFTs need their own standard for longer-term adoption, hence why we are involved with EIP-4973. With regard to the use cases, we see some similarities between Galxe and Rabbithole, as both are focused on capturing web3 user achievements for user acquisition (in the case of Galxe, predominantly users for DeFi apps & protocols). On the other hand, we are explicitly focused on DAOs and higher-assurance cases such as badges representing roles within a community & enabling the associated permissions (e.g., access permissions or governance). If we look at DAOs outer layers (i.e., new people coming in), Rabbithole and Galxe may focus on that layer, whereas Otterspace focuses on the inner operations layer. Considering collaboration opportunities, we reckon that Optimism can acquire new users, particularly in the DeFi or NFT trading space with Galxe. Whereas with Otterspace, Optimism can acquire more DAOs and DAO contributors. While Otterspace badges are currently distributed to contributors using manual attestation, we are also working on capturing on-/off-chain activities and expect this functionality to go live later this year.

Presentation  We are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee, responsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure (wallets, bridges etc.).  2. About the project  Otterspace is building infrastructure for DAOs to issue Badges (soulbound NFTs) based on DAO members\u2019 on & off-chain actions. The idea is that these Badges can help DAOs to perform non-financialized governance, automate permissions (access rights, etc.), manage community-specific reputation/credentials, and create better incentive systems\u2026 The product is in closed-beta right now with a handful of DAO\u2019s actively using Otterspace. External links:  Website: https://www.otterspace.xyz/ 11  Twitter: https://twitter.com/otterspace_xyz 1   Similar OP Governance proposals:   Boardroom - 100K OP tokens   3. About the following  The proposal was detailed and the authors responded to several questions raised around implementation details.  4. About the proposal valuation    Added value (good to bad): good. Otterspace intends to bring some valuable tools for DAOs to the table to rewards its most active members & experiment with more plutocratic voting systems.  Impact or expected usage (high to low): low to medium. There are several projects offering similar functionalities than Otterspace. It remains to be seen whether DAOs will integrate Badges into their workflows and whether this will have a positive impact on DAO operations.  Current Status [Development stage/Open Source?] (early to ready): somewhat ready. For now, they have a functional platform which is being live-tested by a handful of DAO\u2019s. As part of this grant they intend to on-board more DAO\u2019s and eventually open up access to their platform altogether. Their contracts are open-source and they are contributing to an EIP- standard for Soulbound tokens. and several integrations, but developers are encouraged to use the Socket bases for new use cases.  Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate): standard. They intend to sell 70% of their $OP grant to $ETH and airdrop $ETH to Badge claimants to make up for incurred gas costs. The remainder (30%) is intended to be distributed as additional incentive to integration partners .  Amount requested (high to low): high. The amount seems high for a project of this type and the impact of the grant is questionable. Transaction costs on Optimism are low so the barrier to claim Badges for DAO contributors is low anyhow. A similar approved grant request by Otterspace to the Radicle DAO requested merely $12,500. Especially the \u201cbribes\u201d to integration partners seems redundant and could lead to Nepotism ( free money for friend projects).   5. KPIs and impact tracking To track the success of the campaign it would make sense to track:   #accounts with airdropped $ETH  #of accounts that claimed their Badge  #of accounts that did their first Optimism tx claiming their Badge  #of DAO\u2019s issuing Badges a written report with case studies how DAO\u2019s successfully implemented the Badges   6. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: No.  We like the problem space Otterspace is solving for and the fact it\u2019s building its infrastructure natively on Optimism. However, the requested amount doesn\u2019t seem reasonable given the state of project, current usage statistics and the expected usage of funds. We consider it appropriate to request a reduction of at least 30% of the amount requested for the next cycle in case it is not approved in the current cycle. ",

Unfortunately, the proposal seems to have been endorsed for Snapshot prematurely. I don\u2019t see the size of the ask as a problem here. The issue is the usage of funds that do not align with the \u201cno sale rule\u201d that is laid out by Optimism governance. A basic pivot to distributing $OP instead of exchanging it for $ETH first, would solve the problem and fund a highly beneficial Optimism native project. Hoping to see a refined proposal up on Snapshot again next cycle. ",
