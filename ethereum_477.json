Can the FEMians ping their IETF contacts to chime in on their respective interests in the FEM\u2014I\u2019d like to hear from any of them what they think IETF can bring into the FEM. On the FEM side, it would be a great win if we could get some long-term IETF handlers to assist in crafting/guiding the FEM policies and practices. ",
