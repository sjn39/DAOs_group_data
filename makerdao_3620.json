For more information about the history of this MIP, please see:  Collateral Onboarding Core Unit Update Collateral Onboarding Core Unit Launch Pod Session Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit Ask Maker Anything   Specification  Motivation Building upon the theme of sustainability of the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit (CES), the budget reflects support of the Mandates and business continuity in MIP39. Any elements of this budget reflecting a likeness to other Core Units is a principle of building on the shoulders of giants. Much appreciation is given to all the trailblazers.  Core Unit ID Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit  Budget Implementation The CES budget is designed with the following in mind:  Paying for the operational costs to run the Core Unit Building a reserve for sustainability  Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders make a commitment to:  An initial six month budget for CES A continuous funding model that operates on a semi-annual basis based upon achieving CES milestones A MKR vesting schedule for CES based upon the SES MKR Incentive Plan    Budget Responsibilities  Auditor\u2019s multi-sig Wallet to honor and uphold MKR holders preference for the CES Budget Breakdowns Operational multi-sig Wallet to run the operations of CES CES commitment to the transparency and accounting of funds during all budget cycles   List of Budget Breakdowns  Team Structure The team will consist of seven full and part time Core Unit contributors.  Team Summary for 2021-2022     Team Members      Full Time    Core Unit Facilitator 1   Technical Product Owner 1   Smart Contract Engineers 3   Part Time    Advisors 2   Team Total 7    Total Budget Cap for the Cycle The Total Budget Cap is $1,223,552, spanning a six month Cycle. The annual budget is projected at $2,375,469.      6 Months 12 Months     Budget $1,223,552 $2,375,469    Budget Detail     Summary Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 12 Months     Salary $250,000 $343,750 $343,750 $343,750 $1,281,250   Benefits + Taxes $75,000 $103,125 $103,125 $103,125 $384,375   Travel $15,000 $15,000 $15,000 $15,000 $60,000   Hardware $17,500 $0 $0 $0 $17,500   IT & Subscriptions $25,000 $8,333 $8,333 $8,333 $50,000   Referral & Sign-on Expense $100,000 $0 $0 $0 $100,000   Audits $0 $0 $0 $0 $0   Bug Bounty $0 $0 $0 $0 $0   Gas Costs $5,625 $5,625 $5,625 $5,625 $22,500   SC Verification & QA $0 $0 $0 $0 $0   Professional Services $75,000 $25,000 $25,000 $25,000 $150,000   Contingency Buffer $84,469 $75,125 $75,125 $75,125 $309,844   Total $647,594 $575,958 $575,958 $575,958 $2,375,469    A few notes about the Budget Detail:   The Budget Detail in the first Formal Submission of this MIP was $3,133,211. This has been lowered to $2,375,469. The decrease is primarily due to removing three headcounts two of which were temporary. We feel this more accurately represents the budget. Also note this budget includes a Benefits + Tax provision for $384,375.   Any business functions (HR, Legal, Operations, DevOps, etc.) not listed here will be contracted on an hourly basis as Professional Services.   The budget represents a fully populated team based upon a hiring schedule. The actual amount might be lower due to the availability of smart contract engineers.   Illustrating these details as a percentage of the total budget request for overall comparison (12 months):  CES 12 Month Budget884\u00d7545 33.2 KB   Budget Details: Providing additional detail with regards to the above line items: Salary: The initial team has three full-time Smart Contract Engineers, one full-time Technical Product Owner, one Facilitator/Team Leader, and two part-time Advisors (for a total of seven permanent members). Benefits + Taxes: The total cost of an employee includes salary, all benefits (including healthcare), and taxes. This has been calculated by scaling salaries by 30%. This premium is likely an overestimation, and the realized cost is expected to be lower. That being said, paying salaries to a global remote team in a multitude of jurisdictions can be quite expensive. Travel: The team may travel to present at industry events or participate in a team offsite. The budgeted amount is $1000 per person per month. Hardware: An allocation of $3,500 per new team member. IT & Subscriptions: We anticipate a variety of costs relating to software subscriptions, cloud services, and contract service providers. Referral & Sign-on Expenses: Provided at the discretion of the Facilitator to attract top talent to the team. Audits: Initially, this work will be coordinated with the Protocol Engineering Core Unit. Budget modifications will be submitted when appropriate. Bug Bounty: Initially, this work will be coordinated with the Protocol Engineering Core Unit. Budget modifications will be submitted when appropriate. Gas Costs: Initially, this work will be coordinated with the Protocol Engineering Core Unit. A nominal amount has been allocated for administration. Budget modifications will be submitted when appropriate. SC Verification & QA: Initially, this work will be coordinated with the Protocol Engineering Core Unit. Budget modifications will be submitted when appropriate. Professional Services: Coverage for managing general operational overhead and services, legal costs including entity creation, legal officer/company insurance, as well as monthly and annual financial reporting. Contingency Buffer: Approximately 15% of budgeted costs to be held in reserves for business continuity. The CES entity will be a business in the United States and corporate tax rates may apply to these reserves.  MKR Vesting and Incentive Structure The MKR vesting schedule for CES based upon the SES MKR Incentive Plan.  MKR Vesting Details     Property Value     MKR/USD lock-in Price (Post Ratification) Trailing 6 month average   MKR/USD lock-in Price (OG) MKR = $1,956 (11/12/20 - 05/12/21)   MKR Price Floor (Post Ratification) -30% (Trailing 6 month average hire price)   MKR Price Floor (OG) -30% ($1,369)   Vesting Period 3 years   Cliff Vest 12 months   Vesting Schedule After cliff has expired, the Biannual MKR amount vests every 6 months   Manual Repricing yes   Auto-Renewal yes     MKR Forecast Assuming a fully populated team today and based upon the OG Price, this would result in the vesting transfer schedule below.     Vesting Date Vesting Transfer Date MKR Amount     30 Sep 2022 01 Oct 2022 1052.63 MKR   31 Mar 2022 01 Apr 2023 526.315 MKR   30 Sep 2022 01 Oct 2023 526.315 MKR   31 Mar 2022 01 Apr 2024 526.315 MKR   30 Sep 2022 01 Oct 2024 526.315 MKR    Total 3,157.89 MKR    A few notes about the MKR vesting schedule:   The MKR Forecast assumes the CES Core Unit will onboard a full team and the MKR Incentives will be based upon the OG Price. If the team is not fully populated at ratification, the MKR total also covers a Manual Repricing situation at 30% below the current six month average. Either way, we feel there is sufficient maximum buffer built into this model.   The Vesting Transfer Date is one day after that period\u2019s Vesting Date. For example, a Sep 30 Vesting Date would have a Vesting Transfer Date of Oct 1.    Budget Implementation  Goals The CES budget implementation is architected to build and sustain a stable Core Unit in relation to the volatility in our industry.  Funding for the initial six months of the Core Unit with a contingency reserve Thereafter, a continuous funding model operating on a semi-annual basis MKR incentives with a Vesting Period of three years, a 12 month cliff, and six month vesting after the cliff Provide full transparency and accounting of funds during all budget periods    Total Budget Cap for the Cycle The Total Six Month Budget Cap, as specified in the Budget Breakdown, will be transferred to the Auditor\u2019s Wallet after ratification. This wallet will keep the funds and transfer them as requested by CES, per the below. The Auditors Wallet balance will never exceed the upper limit voted by Governance. If this limit needs to be raised, or we\u2019re no longer expecting to ever need it, an additional subproposal MIP will be submitted to adjust it.  CES Budgeting Cycle  CES Budgeting Cycle785\u00d7504 58.4 KB   Core Unit Ratification When the CES Core Unit is ratified:  Core Unit begins Six month budget is transferred to Auditor\u2019s multi-sig Wallet Initial requested budget is transferred into the CES Operational multi-sig Wallet   Core Unit Monthly Budgeting Cycle Within the first 5 days of each month, CES will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditor\u2019s Wallet with the following sections:  For each month, provide an accounting of funds spent in the prior month Provide an updated budget for the remaining cycle Provide a MKR vesting overview, by month Auditor verification of accounting Requested additional budget allocation & MKR incentives transferred into the CES Auditor & Operational multi-sig Wallet  The Monthly Budget Statements will be added to the MakerDAO forum. The originals can be found in this git repository on Github.  Core Unit Summary Cycle  Reconciliation of budget, actual vs. spent Review results & achievements Present new budget, MKR vesting, & goals Entire committed budget transferred to Auditor\u2019s multi-sig Wallet Initial budget transferred into the CES Operational multi-sig Wallet   MKR Incentive Vesting Implementation MKR will be transferred from the Auditor\u2019s multi-sig Wallet into the CES Operational multi-sig Wallet no later than Core Unit Monthly Budgeting Cycle before the month the MKR actually vests. For example, if a Vesting Transfer Date is 01 Oct 2022, the MKR will be transferred into the Operational Wallet no later than August 2022 Core Unit Monthly Budgeting Cycle. Once DssVest is ratified and implemented, CES will investigate the use of automated MKR incentive vesting.  Wallets The following wallets are involved:   The Auditor\u2019s Wallet \u2013 A 3-out-of-4 multi-sig, controlled by trusted Maker DAO members. This multi-sig will hold the Total Budget Cap in DAI. All funds pass through this wallet before any are sent to the CES operational wallet. One of the signers is the Facilitator of the CES Core Unit. The signers of the Auditors Wallet are still being confirmed and will be added to the MIP40c3-SP14 forum thread. No funds will be sent to this wallet before the signers\u2019 addresses have been set in the wallet.   The Operational Wallet \u2013 A 2-out-of-3 multi-sig, controlled by CES. This multi-sig will be used for Core Unit expenses. One of the signers is the Team Leader of the CES Core Unit.

An allocation of cost is based upon the fine art of product and feature estimation. In the product development world, that means we are using iterative software development best practices and techniques to come up with our estimates. While we can calculate these costs based upon the development time a feature will take, there is a higher level we really need to take into consideration\u2026opportunity cost. Or put another way, what is the impact to the protocol if we don\u2019t do this collateral or collateral types? I\u2019ll leave that point alone for now since that is an entire discussion in itself. If you want to geek out a little bit on a technique I use, have at it! WSJF - Scaled Agile Framework To reduce bottlenecks, we\u2019ll also need to use outside auditing firms and there is an additional cost with that. There are varying levels of overhead with the other core units as well: Risk, Oracles, Protocol Engineering, SES (Integrations), and Growth. The dependencies on their resources will vary over time and based upon the complexity of the collateral and consumption. Generally speaking, when we have a class or category of collateral where we\u2019ve systematized it, a lot less cost. I think this is quantifiable in the near term. For complex collaterals, it\u2019s unknown what the cost will be at the moment. Once we start to consolidate the collateral onboarding functions within the core unit, the tools and best practices I use will give us a lot of visibility into estimated costs for onboarding a single piece of collateral or an entire category. Personally, my opinion is that prioritizing jobs based on economics, which implies cost, is the most important data point. I\u2019m unsure what value, other than budgeting, of what hard costs give us. I\u2019m always open to feedback in this area. My view is always one of looking at a project such as this as a \u201cproduct\u201d and providing incremental value each time we ship software. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve done my entire career and it works really well. ",

My thought is that I am a trusted member of MakerDAO if I am onboarded as a facilitator and I\u2019d like to be part of the budget process. Maybe it\u2019s in the name \u201cauditor\u201d based upon your first comment. My thought right now it to change that to something like \u201cThe DAO Wallet\u201d since CES Budgeting Cycle takes care of the auditing and accountability parts. I was trying to model it after SES budgeting and I\u2019m not sure those labels apply accurately to CES. MIP51 defines the Monthly Governance Cycle. How would I word the initial transfers of DAI & MKR to the wallets? ",

The CUs that have been passed have generally been existing teams coming over from the Foundation or teams that have grown organically within the DAO. Those that have followed the latter path have started with smaller budgets and team sizes and scaled up as they have established credibility with the community. It concerns me that you\u2019ve requested a $1.5M budget up front for a team that consists of solely an advisor and yourself. I would expect that you\u2019ve built a network of experienced software engineers from your time at the Foundation and prior and would prefer to see a more measured approach in building the a base and scaling this CU given the lack of commitments at this stage. I believe it is premature to be requesting MKR compensation, especially over a four year vesting period when the only person on the proposed 10 person team we know is yourself and the CU is unknown to the DAO. This is not comparable to the PE team at all given their high engagement and visibility working with the DAO and an existing fully functioning team. I would request any MKR compensation be postponed until after the CU DAI budget has been approved by Governance and be kept in a separate thread similar to SES and Growth\u2019s recent proposals. Regarding the proposal, couple questions:  CES is a business venture that becomes a profitable entity.  Could you explain what you mean by this quote?  I\u2019d also like to make sure I am very clear on one point. This Core Unit is a highly-collaborative effort and it\u2019s a partnership, not competition, with the key stakeholders in the DAO. CES will continuously work with Protocol Engineering, Oracles, Risk, Real World Finance, and other critical stakeholders to:  Could you also discuss how you have and are currently collaborating with these CUs? If not currently, how do you envision each CUs role, specifically, in working with CES?  Contingency Buffer: Approximately 15% of budgeted costs to be held in reserves for business continuity. The CES entity will be a business and this will represent a profit by tax standards. Therefore, the actual amount in reserves will be lower due to corporate tax rates in the United States.  Could you also explain how CES will be a profitable entity by tax standards? ",

I\u2019ve been with the Foundation for almost two years and have deep domain knowledge of Maker and how we\u2019ve got to this point in our evolution. While I am new to many in the community, I\u2019ve worked very closely with the core unit facilitators and contributors I\u2019ll be interacting with and understand the issues, concerns, and roadblocks of collateral management. Overall, the budget only gets spent when people are hired into roles that we\u2019re trying to fill. I\u2019d love to have a team to start but Nik and Derek cornered the market. Right now in our industry, we\u2019re not sitting with an abundance of smart contract engineers waiting to be hired so we need to create the opportunities. The CES core unit is an opportunity creator. Everyone we\u2019re targeting are gainfully employed elsewhere. Sure, we can wait and try to grow organically. It\u2019s my opinion that route isn\u2019t what the protocol needs right now and it will prevent us from scaling the supply side in the short term. MKR compensation is formulaic based upon the salary we\u2019re offering. Engineers will have the competency and aptitude to deliver or they will not. It\u2019s not just me watching this but the PE and Oracles core units as well as the community. If someone isn\u2019t making the grade (including me), they will not be around for long and therefore the grant will not vest. I believe there are the safe guards in place to prevent the \u201cfriends and family\u201d effect. Switching gears\u2026 My belief is that businesses need to be profitable. Building an entity or company based upon a cost only model is a recipe for failure especially in an industry like ours due to the wild swings in crypto market caps. Initially, I\u2019m proposing a cost plus model since we\u2019re not mature enough to implement anything else. Over time, I\u2019d like to explore other models and incentives that is more aligned with pay for performance. It\u2019s just too early for that at the moment. One aspect of profitability is to allow a business to decide how to invest in operating the business when there are challenging times. Let\u2019s look at how companies survived the economic crisis last year. Generally speaking, most of them did that based upon cash reserves. Imagine all core units going back to governance when crypto markets get tough and asking for money to operate their core units. I\u2019m not sure how that would work. Is a 15% too much/little for a business to make? I\u2019d say it\u2019s quite low based upon looking comparable consulting firms providing like services. In the past, I would not choose to be involved with such an enterprise. In this case, I believe there are other viable business models, based upon performance, that will make it a win-win for the DAO and core units\u2026not just CES. In the US, the challenge is our taxation model. The first dollar of profit is taxable. Any excesses that are held by the core unit are technically considered profit. If a core unit holds the \u201cContingency Buffer\u201d (as most core units have this allocation) then it\u2019s taxable. Current tax law does not consider things like assets held in a multi-sig wallet as someone has to \u201cown\u201d it. We have to look at alternatives. We\u2019re breaking new ground here and either I\u2019ll do it as the facilitator of the CES core unit or someone else will. The RWF post is a great example of the considerations for starting and running a core unit. And there are many more. I\u2019m sharing some of my opinions and beliefs based upon my experience. I believe I\u2019ve identified the key issues and budget to effectively deal with them. You may or may not agree and that\u2019s ok. For me, it\u2019s a matter of when we do this core unit and who is going to lead the work. Please keep the questions coming! ",

When Strategic Marcomms resubmitted, they did utilize a new subproposal. So I apologize for leading you astray, but I think Pablo makes a good point here. Seeing as MIPs are his purview and there\u2019s history with this being done before I think the edits should be submitted under new numbering. If this presents an issue/extra work on your end we can lend a hand with updating repos. ",
