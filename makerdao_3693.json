Governance       The basic idea is that MKR appreciates over time, because the profits of the protocol, beside paying salaries and infrastructure costs, are used to buy MKR in the market (i.e., provide buy pressure) and then burn MKR (i.e., reduce the total supply).  So the idea is that you want to HODL MKR just like you want to hold growth-stocks (without dividends) such as Amazon, etc.     That\u2019s the best answer as to why MKR is going up. ",
