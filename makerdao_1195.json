Here is the transaction adding @Patrick_J and here is the transaction removing @LongForWisdom. Besides that, and transfering the point of contact to @prose11, all other aspects of the GovAlpha Multisig remain the same. A ledger spreadsheet for all our transactions is available here, and tends to accurate within a day of the most recent transactions. Multi-sig Address: 0x01D26f8c5cC009868A4BF66E268c17B057fF7A73 Keyholders:   @prose11 : 0xf3ED2bdeBa77940E6759B806cd55CE20cAE369BE  @Patrick_J : 0x06ADa798f9323392cA30C755383Af879bd853168  Per MIP47c1:   Governance must be able to revoke funding and permissions from approved multi-sigs at any time.

In certain circumstances members of GovAlpha may be added as keyholders at the existing facilitators discretion to maintain an adequate level of security for administered funds.   A wallet address to be whitelisted.   0x01D26f8c5cC009868A4BF66E268c17B057fF7A73  Following an approved Governance action that involves a newly recognized Multi-Sig, the information provided will be added to a list of recognized Multi-Sig Wallets.  @MIP-Editors update the MIP47 list when appropriate.
