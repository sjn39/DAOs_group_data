Within this thesis, I work towards a framework about different stakeholder interests in public and permissionless blockchain projects and created a survey to evaluate this framework. In this regard, if you are in any way involved in such public blockchain projects (e.g. investing, mining, developing service tools, \u2026), I would very much appreciate your participation in that survey. Survey Link: https://www.uzh.ch/zi/cl/umfragen/index.php/967815?lang=en The survey takes no more than 10 minutes and is conducted anonymously. Should there be any questions or remarks, please do not hesitate to contact me. Also, feel free to share this link with others! Thank you very much for your time and consideration. Kind regards Roman ",
