Having a mascot does a few things for the community: It brings a stronger sense of comradery to us by increasing the team-aspect of the DAO. It brings even more prominence to the brand by having another image to remind people of MakerDAO. It brings cool new opportunities for swag, perhaps even a full mascot costume (idea?). It brings a host for animated video series, for Content Production CU. We had a few suggested mascots already from the chat on G-n-R #141, those are included in this poll. This is also open to more ideas; if we can gain something close to a consensus we can move forward with beginning some designs and bring those back for further voting.

Look no further than insurance companies to see how popular these mascots are, a few examples: Geico - Gecko and Caveman Progressive - Flo Liberty Mutual - LiMu the Emu and Doug Allstate - Mayhem Man I think its also a question of B2B vs B2C, with the dust parameter and gas prices where they are today, pursuing a B2C strategy is challenging for us but this will certainly change over time as L2s and scaling are implemented. We definitely want to be in the B2C space long term so I\u2019m supportive of the mascot. ",
