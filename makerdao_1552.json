                    "content": " Dai Foundation position on Patent infringement complaints against MakerDAO The Dai Foundation mandate is limited and specific, stating the foundation is to safeguard MakerDAO\u2019s intangible assets. We can therefore only act on complaints brought forward against MakerDAO in situations where the ownership and control of MakerDAO intangible assets is put at risk, or where there is infringement of intangible assets that Dai Foundation holds. It is unfortunately very easy - and common - to have a lawyer produce a legal complaint without merit that is made in the hope of making a profit. From time to time, such claims appear on the MakerDAO Forum from actors often characterized as \u201cpatent trolls.\u201d The Dai Foundation will review complaints that it discovers or is made aware of, and engage if there is a clear risk of losing control/ownership of MakerDAO intangible assets. However, in order to use our funds with prudence, we will NOT spend resources on countering claims that only contain vague or very broad statements without substance. That said, if a MakerDAO actor faces a legal threat related to alleged inappropriate use of someone else\u2019s intellectual property (IP), the Dai Foundation is ready to help by clarifying the scope of MakerDAO IP that it holds. For example, the affected Maker party may be able to prove that the IP it used (e.g. copyright or trademark) preceded the patent application. Anyone who finds themselves in this situation, or has any doubt whether this is relevant, feel free to reach out.   The list of IP assets owned by the Dai Foundation is public and available here. ",
