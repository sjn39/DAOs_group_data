                    "content": "Maybe I\u2019m just not in the right Discord servers, but I was caught by surprise in seeing this announcement yesterday: a new fractional reserve DeFi protocol launched by GFX Labs, launching as soon as June 13.    Medium \u2013 1 Jun 22    Announcing Interest Protocol GFX Labs is excited to announce that Interest Protocol (IP) will launch on the Ethereum blockchain on June 13th, 2022.  Reading time: 5 min read       It looks like the system is based on an over-collateralised stablecoin called USDi, built to pay yield to all USDi holders (no matter where they got the USDi). The announcement says that the protocol has less liquidity risk than Compound or Aave, but is also highly scalable, using fractionalised reserve banking. \u201cIP applies fractional reserve banking to DeFi by allowing users to deposit USDC into the protocol, issuing USDi to depositors and borrowers, and maintaining a reserve of USDC.\u201d Had a dive through the Interest Protocol whitepaper and page three sees the authors directly compare IP to Maker. The whitepaper claims that there are four differences between the two:  Interest Protocol pays interest to all holders of USDi, while Maker pays interest only through the DSR (when turned on) to DAI staked in the DSR contract Interest Protocol offers cross-margin vaults, versus only single-collateral vaults at Maker Interest rates are determined algorithmically at IP, but manually via governance at Maker Interest Protocol has a \u201cmore simple and efficient\u201d liquidation mechanism  It\u2019s obviously early days, but GFX Labs (not least through their Maker and Compound experience) are capable and experienced operators and so I\u2019m inclined to think this new protocol could emerge as a serious player in DeFi. On that basis, even though the protocol is yet to launch, it seems reasonable to discuss whether this protocol could emerge as a genuine competitor to Maker. That comparison seems front of mind for Interest Protocol as well, given a few provocative tweets like this one:   twitter.com    Interest Protocol @InterestDeFi  People have asked, \"why is Interest Protocol superior to@MakerDAO?\" We could say it is because of multi-collateral vaults, liquidation mechanism, oracle infrastructure, or because IP pays interest to lenders. But there is one main reason: USDi has a stronger peg than DAI.   10:05 PM - 2 Jun 2022           18                2            Would be interested to hear from @GFXlabs on this:  To what extent do they see Interest Protocol as a direct challenger to Maker? Does their launching of Interest Protocol raise a conflict with their role as a significant delegate for Maker?  Any other thoughts or opinions welcome. ",

I was confused by this as well. The Interest Protocol announcement describes the system as both (emphasis added):  \"A fractional reserve bank maintains a portion of its deposits in cash and uses the rest to generate loans. IP applies fractional reserve banking to DeFi by allowing users to deposit USDC into the protocol, issuing USDi to depositors and borrowers, and maintaining a reserve of USDC. Two types of assets back USDi: USDC, which is liquid, and over-collateralized loans, which generate revenue but are less liquid than USDC. Therefore, USDi is an over-collateralized stablecoin. Fractional reserves maintain liquidity; collateralization ensures solvency. Undercollateralized stablecoins such as UST are insolvent by design; USDi, on the other hand, is designed to remain solvent even under adverse market conditions.\"  This is a tricky thing to reconcile. OK, the loans are over-collaterised, but that doesn\u2019t mean that USDi is necessarily an over-collateralised stablecoin given that there is another way to generate USDi (depositing USDC, some of which is then lent out per their fractional system). Possibly this is where the system\u2019s \u2018dynamic interest rate system\u2019 is supposed to kick in to ensure USDi is adequately backed, but it\u2019s not clear to me that that\u2019s a reliable mechanism in adverse market conditions like those that engulfed Terra.

It inherits most of the strengths of @MakerDAO, @AaveAave, and @compoundfinance while removing weaknesses https://t.co/2Zxtuqx6bb    9:22 AM - 3 Jun 2022           6                1            Here is my two gwei (in Dai of course). I paraphrase much of what I put on Twitter apologies for the redundancy.  I\u2019m not sure what this particular situation would compare to in meatspace. Can a member of the Board of Coca Cola launch a competing soda pop drink and market it as \u2018builds on the strengths of Coca Cola Zero\u2019? It might be legally possible but it\u2019s one of those \u201cfeels like it probably shouldn\u2019t be\u201d. Even in countries with a slightly different angle on shareholder obligations (e.g. Germany, where a Board answers to the company), it would still feel the same. I don\u2019t like operating on \u2018feelings\u2019 though so this is unsatisfying. In crypto of course everything is a bit of a wild west free market, you take the good with the bad. There is no formal fiduciary obligation for board members / delegates to serve the interests of the token holder or company. So what GFX is doing is perfectly ok, namely: serve on the \u2018board\u2019 of MakerDAO and build a competitor to MakerDAO - or rather, there are no laws or rules or MIPs against it. I expect it to evolve one of a number of different lines:  Self-regulation Recusal Carve-outs Market forces Legal intervention Rent-creation   1. Self-regulation GFX publicly commits to ring-fence activities relating to Compound Finance, MakerDAO and Interest Protocol. While their intentions may be sincere, how can the public know this is the case in a \u201cDon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d environment without an enforcement mechanism or regulations? An investment bank gets criticism for serving analyst reports on companies they sell advisory business. Though they are behind a Chinese wall with legal repercussions if broken. Despite the apparent potential for ill-doings, people who have worked at banks will explain just how paranoid people are about not \u2018wall-crossing\u2019. Maybe a closer parallel is with unregulated consulting business, where one consulting team can and often does work for competing businesses. But in this instance, they are mere agents, not principals of their clients. Often they are hired for the very reason that they have a lot of \u2018industry experience\u2019, read, confidential information from competitors.  2. Recusal GFX recuses themselves either from Interest Protocol or delegation to Compound and MakerDAO. Arguably, they had the opportunity to recuse themselves and pick one of Compound or MakerDAO. Why didn\u2019t anyone pick up on this before? Maybe its because the degree of competition is not so direct. You could argue they only compete incidentally. In the case of Interest Protocol, the direct competition (with both) is much clearer.  3. Carve-out GFX carves-out competing governance businesses and venture investments into separate entities with a primary sale to unrelated parties to disconnect the conflict. It solves the conflict but is costly, annoying and forces shareholders of GFX to pick a side essentially which may not be their goal. Also, through their venture investments, they may come to sit in governance roles in competing businesses.  4. Market forces GFX continues serving on boards for competing businesses but tokenholders undelegate governance votes or market participants elect not to use new venture for fear of being caught in cross-hairs. Has to assume participants are minimally rational (are they?). I would love this to be the case, that the market can interpret signals rationally and coldly and picks one over the other.  5. Legal intervention Highly undesirable but there is scope for legal interventions in absence of broader formal DeFi regulation e.g. claiming breach of related laws but not directly breach of Clayton Act for the GFX entity. Case in point, the OpenSea insider trading case, was not on basis of insider trading [edit: securities fraud] (even though it transparently was) but on wire fraud, etc. EDIT: Humble pie, there is no such thing as \u2018insider trading\u2019 but securities fraud, timely from Matt Levine. I would absolutely hate for the government to try and weigh in a situation where there is no criminal wrongdoing just an apparent strange confluence of interests that regulators have tried to resolve in other contexts. Regulators only know how to regulate, they are a hammer in perpetual search for a nail. I hope they stay as far as possible from this space until they have no choice but to recognize facts on the ground. Taxpayer funds are much better employed in hospitals and schools.  6. Rent-creation Also highly undesirable outcome where GFX essentially manipulates either their venture investment or their governance responsibilities to maximize rent-creation in one or the other. Market participants don\u2019t notice, no legal consequences are brought, GFX wins at the expense of every other player. Obviously undesirable - I would venture even for GFX if they wish to build a business for the long-run.  7. Other Maybe I missed some other creative alternatives, e.g. GFX tries to have the cake and eat the tokens too and airdrops Compound and Maker tokens in Interest Protocol or similar.  I made some other tangents on contributors/agents, etc but I leave that to Twitter. Relevant sauce from the friends at Skadden: Interlocking Boards: The Antitrust Risk You May Never Have Heard Of | Insights | Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP Hope this is useful in informing a calm, rational and respectful discussion where we assume the best of others until proven otherwise.

I think a more apt description is as members in a large member managed LLC, which is different than a board and where there are no common law duties owed by members to each other. In my opinion, delegates owe nothing to the DAO and are mere proxies for the holders from whom they receive MKR. The reason I am voicing my opinion here is to push back on the potential for \u201cnarrative creep\u201d. If we start assuming or stating that MKR holders owe some \u201cduty\u201d to the DAO, it becomes easier to ad hominem denounce and attack those MKR holders when they do something that we don\u2019t like or which fails to align with what we want or support for the DAO. For instance, shitting on GFX for their Interest Protocol thing and how it may violate Paper\u2019s \u201cduty\u201d as a delegate/MKR holder then becomes a way to diminish his positions with regard to the proposed debt raise (ie, the DAO offering yield generating financial assets to investors). That\u2019s what we should not want to see. FWIW, I don\u2019t really give a shit about GFX\u2019s thing, which, as Doo noted, will likely fail if they don\u2019t have a team of people working on integrations, etc. ",

Personally I think it\u2019s a good trade off, but that\u2019s what some people would respond with.   Definitely a trade-off. A few things: 1. DAI wants to be a money network and frankly crypto is too narrow an ecosystem. Crypto-lending is now a commoditized product, so we must find new territory to capture. Ultimately need to start bridging the gap between meatspace and DeFi. Is the current formulation perfect? No. But we will evolve the RWAP (Real world asset protocol) such that one day it will look nothing like the way structured finance currently looks (a mess of consultants, lawyers, courts, closed ledgers, middle-men etc.). Rather than do nothing, we must start somewhere. 2. I actually think, if you let the game theory play out, having tie-ins with legitimate, regulated incumbents like HVB makes us more anti-fragile, not less. Rather than shedding legacy completely, we are bridging to it, inviting it in. If I were a regulator, I might see good faith.     AliceinMKRland:  Seems like kicking out one of the few professional delegates would make the protocol a lot more fragile. If we chased GFX off, who exactly will replace them?   Many of us believe we are at an inflection point in Maker\u2019s trajectory. Terra model failed\u2014Maker has never been in such position of relative strength. We\u2019ve got a suite of great products to roll out: D3M, L2 MCD, Maker teleport, multi-chain etc. If we execute this growth correctly, Maker is a tremendous success. If we get bogged down in ineffectual governance and navel-gazing, Maker disappears into the red ocean of commoditized crypto-lending. Due to this urgency, we\u2019ve been encouraging large, sophisticated token holders to come out of dormancy.   What have we learned? Voter apathy is driven by complexity. Maker\u2019s product is now too complex for its governance apparatus. Governance will have to adapt in two ways 1) Change the nature of decisions that MKR holders make. More of a Board of Directors (hire, fire, corporate action, budgeting), less like a vote-on-every-little-thing committee 2) Bring a wide set of expertise to the voting bench. I think you\u2019ll see the composition of delegates and active MKR holders change drastically over the next six months. There\u2019s too much to benefit from if the next era is done right. You\u2019re already seeing reputable participants like @Hasu and @mhonkasalo as well as sophisticated funds like Blocktower enter the fray. This will only continue such that all large delegates will have to demonstrate clear value-add towards one or multiple of the domains that underpin MakerDAO\u2019s business lines. GFX is great because they can contend well with the complexity in the trenches. There are many others like this but Maker needs to find a way to condense itself into a form that experts can interact with. The opp. cost to digging through the forums and establishing context is too high for the potential reward. From talking to some of large token holders, there are two ways to drive participation: 1. Information leverage (Dashboards that simplify decision-making like Messari Governor) 2. Delegation: large funds don\u2019t want to do this because it makes them look unsophisticated. It\u2019s on all of us, especially the core units, to find ways to get those most equipped to shepherd the protocol involved. ",

Can you explain what you mean @CodeKnight that Rune is one of \u201cthe responsible parties\u201d here? In any case, strong disagreement that the public announcement by GFX should somehow not immediately be discussed publicly and openly right here on the MakerDAO forum.     Eumenes:  But do believe that \u201csunlight is the best disinfectant\u201d   Fun fact: my name \u201cKianga\u201d means \u201csunbeam,\u201d so it would be doubly fitting to call ACREinvest the \u201cSunlight Delegate\u201d. There\u2019s nothing whatsoever problematic with community members expressing their views openly here whether deferential to the parties under scrutiny or not. In fact, our resiliency as a project will be enhanced if participants know that their actions may result in a swift public debate rather than a closed-door, private opportunity to deflect criticism.     Tosh9.0:  What possible fiduciary duties could a delegate have to Maker? They aren\u2019t \u201cdirectors\u201d in any sense of the word.   100% Agree with your sentiment here @Tosh9.0 The higher authority we all need to consider is the one-two punch of long-term stakeholder TRUST & LEGITIMACY. If we fail to sustain these, it\u2019s curtains. We cannot find the perfect set of standards to bear here by looking backward at a failed legacy system. The evidence of that failure is the open door we all walked through to be on this forum in this moment, thanks to a little whitepaper published on October 31, 2008. With that in mind\u2026     adcv:  it\u2019s also perfectly legitimate to ask whether GFX can credibly be a good steward of both Maker and Interest. I don\u2019t see any ad hominem. My own pov is that I don\u2019t think it was particularly thought through to announce Interest as an improvement on Maker. It begs some perfectly reasonable questions.   Yes, absolutely.

Personally I think it\u2019s a good trade off, but that\u2019s what some people would respond with.   Important observation @AliceinMKRland! We need to apply this awareness to the substance of every strategic decision going forward, both at the product level but also in terms of delegated Governance and the actions of large MKR holders - something I pointed out on Twitter flagging the RWF team as part of this larger conversation.   twitter.com    kianga.eth \ud83c\udf0d 1000 ACRE DAOs in 1000 Days @fhomoney  \ud83e\udee3 Antitrust & DAOs What are the implications? \u26a0\ufe0f Especially as@MakerDAO moves into RWA entanglement, has Core Units that are companies.

Attack vectors that could present serious or even existential risk to the Protocol should be taken seriously whatever their potential source.   Well said @Eumenes, which is why I have concerns about how we currently have no structure or consensus in place to manage certain unacceptable risks that meat space did figure out were a problem for free and fair markets (with negative consequences for consumers/customers) a long time ago.     adcv:  In the US, GFX serving Maker as a delegate as well as, presumably, on Interest Protocol, would be flatly forbidden: 15 U.S. Code \u00a7 19 - Interlocking directorates and officers | U.S. Code | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute   So, while we are doing a NEW thing, we don\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater (when it suits us, I suppose). Again, @Eumenes often says correctly, let\u2019s not innovate on ways to lose money as an institutional-grade lender. Similarly, let\u2019s not open ourselves up to be looted by conflicts if we can learn from the past as to better starting point for how to navigate these conflicts in our new Web3 paradigm. Simply \u201cabstaining from voting\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it. The community is not well informed REAL TIME what specific conflicting business interests may comprise the entanglements. And to date I have not seen very much detailed transparency when potential and actual conflicts have been disclosed.     teej:  GFX is great because they can contend well with the complexity in the trenches. There are many others like this but Maker needs to find a way to condense itself into a form that experts can interact with. The opp. cost to digging through the forums and establishing context is too high for the potential reward.   The situation is actually exactly NOT great for the reasons you go on to specify @teej. What you state is fact, so it really does open us up to active engagement from organizations who WILL turn their privileged position of influence, trust and ecosystem access to their own commercial advantage. We cannot just say, oh well - it\u2019s open source so what are you gonna do? Or, well, it\u2019s fine because GFX is talented and smart and we\u2019re happy to have them engaged.     AliceinMKRland:  Seems weird we can have anons as facilitators or anons making proposals to fire people, but we can\u2019t give the benefit of the doubt to one of the delegates who has been here since delegation started   Yes, absolutely @AliceinMKRland we need to address the open proposal process. I speak a bit to that very problem here:    Off-Chain Proposal Bounties Governance       MakerDAO is now too large and complex to continue undifferentiated governance and delegate responsibilities. Vastly more proposals and discussions that are not segmented or categorized for quality and relevance to DAO priorities, needs or otherwise will dilute the effectiveness and robustness of governance as currently structured.  If we are going to protect and provide for the success of the protocol through, for example, scaling sophisticated DeFi versions of RWA TradFi structures, we cannot h\u2026     However, we also do not have the luxury of giving anyone \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d, all due respect to OGs here. And I DO respect you! Who is going to be aggressive and fierce and push back on anyone on behalf of MakerDAO as a whole (and not just pursue the interests of a specific powerful voting block of MKR tokens)? I volunteer to be that kind of Delegate because, by the way, it actually would be in the financial benefit of ALL MKR holders if our Governance system has a better buffer against partisan gridlock.

Instead of standards and process being set and enforced by the \u201cowners\u201d of the protocol in a consistent and transparent way, new task forces and projects are proposed and new budgets requested that lack that consistency and transparency, but place a large amount of discretion in a small amount of hands. Pretty soon, you\u2019ll be having invite-only meetings and secret pitch decks that the bureaucracy uses to curry favor and align unnamed groups behind closed doors prior to an open vote. You might even find that bureaucracy threatening individuals offline who directly or indirectly object to its plans. Oh wait, that\u2019s already happening\u2026 So, while consolidated voting power may be an existential concern that has yet to be evidenced, I think there is a very specific, yet more insidious and less dramatic attack vector already gaining traction. And this is very germane to this post because GFX is not doing anything like what I describe. Someone (or some entity) that owns MKR and actively participates in governance created a side project. That project directly competes (arguably) with another DeFi project, but not yet MakerDAO in any material way. Is it a potential conflict of interest held by GFX - maybe, but there\u2019s no clear competitions yet and a rational economic actor doesn\u2019t cut off its nose to spite its face. So, there would have to be a serious scaling up of the Interest protocol AND some irrational behavior or a MKR sale by @GFXlabs or @PaperImperium for that conflict to materialize. However, the consolidation of control, new opaque process and granting of discretionary budgets to CUs or task forces thereof may constitute an actual conflict of interest depending on what that control is used for, what happens behind closed doors, and whose discretion is exercised for whose benefit. At least we have clear-ish information on the former, but just feints and handwaving regarding the latter. If you\u2019re going to examine conflicts of interest, everyone needs to be in scope. CUs don\u2019t get a free pass - that\u2019s why we have open governance and transparent process. ",

I agree that the protocol doesn\u2019t yet compete with Maker, but that\u2019s essentially because it hasn\u2019t launched yet. The Interest Protocol team are going out of their way to encourage comparisons with Maker, are they not?   twitter.com    Interest Protocol @InterestDeFi  People have asked, \"why is Interest Protocol superior to@MakerDAO?\" We could say it is because of multi-collateral vaults, liquidation mechanism, oracle infrastructure, or because IP pays interest to lenders.

We should certainly be on guard at all times as @John_Yarwood says about conflicts wherever they appear, but if launching an explicit competitor to Maker doesn\u2019t justify a discussion about conflicts I\u2019m not sure what would. @Doo_StableLab is right that we shouldn\u2019t assume bad faith, however, so it will be great to hear a little more from @GFXlabs  about their position on all of the above and (presumably) why they believe the launch of IP doesn\u2019t raise a conflict of interests.

                    "content": "I have not dove deeply into the details in the Whitepaper but have done a cursory read of documentation on IP and USDi implementaiton. @Matt_NZ to answer your questions:  To what extent does IP pose as a direct challenger to Maker?  IP basically has three main advantages over Maker.  USDi is redeemable for USDC within the system (the fractional part applies here with respect to liquidity which drives a rate curve for USDi borrowing) USDi has cross collateral backing very much like Compound BUT is ONLY loaning USDi on that collateral so in this respect it is very much like Maker (USDi is the loan accounting metric) USDi by design is a return bearing instrument.  Your USDi grows automatically without any additional effort by the holder.  Point (1) above is pretty ingenious in that IP has USDi rates set across the board by the USDi against USDC liquidity.   Low USDC liquidity higher USDi rates and vice versa.   I think (I need to double check this) that this rate applies to terms of USDi borrowing across the board on collateral types but because USDC backs USDi 1:1 you get interest without having to deposit collateral, you just deposit liquidity.   The issue here is that USDi actually has fractional liquidity in USDC and the rate being paid both to hold USDi (return) is related to the rate paid to borrow USDi. The above is pretty interesting approach to liquidity management, and rate control and basically combines the a USDC PSM 1:1 rate and collateral backing with a Maker like overcollateralized vault structure and borrowing rate management based on USDC liquidity.   Here is where IP shows it is a direct competitor to Maker and not Compound or AAVE etc. in that nothing other than USDi is loaned out.  So the collateral is fully locked against USDi loans, just like Maker.   Using some part or all of the interest to provide direct return to USDi holders is an improvement over DAI/Maker as well.   Points (1) and (3) above are what makes IP/USDi novel, and inherently a better competitor to Maker and DAI.  (2) illustrates how IP is a direct competitor to Maker.   I don\u2019t think hooking up a USDi to a system where you reloan the collateral actually works using a global stablecoin rate/liquidity mechanism.    The above is precisely why I proposed that Maker take an approach to doing a better Maker3.0 and DAI3.0.     Proposal: Maker3.0 - The future of crypto lending. (RFC) Proposal Ideas   Maker3.0 - The future of crypto lending 1T DAI3 is just 1 Maker upgrade away  NOTE:  Some terminology clarification Maker1.0 is SCD and SAI, Maker2.0 is MCD and DAI.  An aggressive growth proposal for Maker.    Maker3.0 - Start fresh - utilize all available information, good and bad to create a new, more competitive, better Maker.  Part of why Maker3.0 is good is the promise of taking everything we now know in DeFI and applying it to the next incarnation of Maker and DAI3.  a) Maker doesn\u2019t hav\u2026     Point of the above proposal is that Maker can not just do what GFX has done with IP (and I am eager to see how this plays out as we will get some really great information as to what users and markets want) but how Maker can build a better system (Maker3.0) a better DAI - DAI3.0, while supercharging Maker2.0. One can debate the IP/USDi liquidity/rate mechanics (the fractional part here) but from my seat USDi is basically a better Maker in almost every respect.   It is better both from a rate management perspective (I have long advocated that Maker SFs needed a variable curve related to amount of DC so we get a market perspective on rates within the available rate curve Proposal interest rate adjustment by debt facility utilization ), and also from a liquidity perspective.   How fractional and whether they end up with liquidity constraints in extreme situations hard to say.  How good the USDi PEG is maintained given the liquidity and rate constraints also will be interesting to see. Conclusion as above IP/USDi at least from my seat is a better Maker/DAI design both from USDi holder, and a rate/liquidity management perspective .   Collateral wise is exactly like Maker in that it doesn\u2019t loan other collateral assets, differs in that USDi rate control on all vaults occurs based on USDC fractional backing liquidity which is a pretty novel approach to automating USDC liquidity coupling to USDI borrowing rates.  Now to your questions 2:  Does their launching of IP raise a conflict with their role with respect to governing Maker with their MKR.  My reaction to this is multifold.  Yes it raises conflict of interest issues with GFX and Maker. These issues rise directly with the amount of MKR they hold. There are potentially issues with large VC players holding and exercising significant governance activities across multiple competing protocols (this is a general issue addressed by SEC rules/regulations regarding substantial ownership stake declarations, etc.) Given the lack of rules and regulations and the way crypto is anonymous there are no practical enforcement mechanisms and even if there were it would involve some form of censorship or blacklisting\u2026  Anyway the above is my own first glance take on IP/USDi as a direct competitor to Maker/DAI and why I believe even more that Maker taking an approach like I laid out with Maker3.0 proposal above is the best and most suitable response.   Since my Maker3.0 approach has long term components I believe it is even more important that a Maker3.0 working group be formed to investigate how Maker can evolve the system and DAI to be even more competitive, and how Maker2.0 and Maker3.0 can energize growth now to while designing and building both at better Maker, and DAI (Maker3.0/DAI3.0)    There is nothing being proposed that involves the real next evolution of a new and better Maker like Maker3.0 (EndGame is only a Maker2.0 evolution that - dead Ends Maker and DAI into what it is now not something that could be substantially better - than even IP/USDi above).

MakerMan:  How fractional and whether they end up with liquidity constraints in extreme situations hard to say. How good the USDi PEG is maintained given the liquidity and rate constraints also will be interesting to see.   This is the key issue, is it not? IP appear to be trading off some risk in the event of an extreme variance/disruption, for the benefit of fractional liquidity the rest of the time. Also, while providing a direct return to USDi holders may be an improvement over Maker right now, we always have the option to turn the DSR on (or offer some other kind of return to DAI holders). In some ways, as has been pointed out elsewhere on the forum, the biggest advantage Maker may have is its Lindy moat: it has survived treacherous bear markets and sudden market shocks and held its peg throughout. That\u2019s quite a powerful selling point in a market littered with the husks of countless stablecoin projects. ",
