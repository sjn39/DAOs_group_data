Gracefully hosted by Loie and Owocki. We have discussed everything from campfire Schelling points to baboon coordination mechanisms and the war in Ukraine. Catch up on prior DAO Vibes by reading the notes below and be sure not to miss the next one in the Gitcoin Discord  Add Event to your calendar   3/30 DAO Vibezzz       What parts of your life that don\u2019t seem directly related to web3 keep popping up in web3 communities?  Loie stayed in a Hacker House in Barcelona and met an activist who was from a very small activist community near her hometown. She found different elements of herself are reflected within Web3. Colton sees a lot of overlaps with web3 and mindfulness/meditation. This topic often comes up in his circles. He also was in Andrew Yang\u2019s political campaign before being in Web3 and then felt amazing to see Andrew Yang on stage in Denver and knowing people that were so integral to his campaign were now in Web3  Andrew Yang\u2019s talk at EthDenver: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzuwqGzk7F8    Ben West: He sees web3 values in the street art community (who are very influential in NFTs) and lots of artist overlap Owocki: Since reading meditations on moloch, he is seeing coordination failures everywhere in life (seeing web3 things outside of web3) like when he and his wife forget to communicate and run out of milk for the kids. Also hears Web3 vocab everywhere too. Got \u2018rugged\u2019 by his nanny not showing up Umar: Seeing \u2018individual\u2019 vs \u2018collectivist\u2019 in his parents. His dad is a former athlete, team player, collectivist. His mom is an individualist, who likes things her way Schelling points come up everywhere and Owocki\u2019s marketing Strat is to make it known Gaming, Mythology, and Web3 have a lot of overlap and reflections: Soulbound NFTs, Raid Guild. This space has a lot of gamification of life DeFi app feels like something between trading, gaming, and working Armando: Everyone in Web3 starts with a positive attitude towards others. Outside of web2, distrust may be the default but inside web3 trust is David DYOR: In his country, one of the major fed political parties is basing his platform on crypto. It\u2019s coming from the right. On the other side, the current leader has been seizing bank accounts and crypto accounts for being linked to donations to trucker protest Loie: Rejecting bipartisan systems is more reflected in Web3 than outside. Crypto gets supported by people on both sides of the aisle, and denies the duality system Lack of coordination tools in the past may have prevented people from finding a middle ground Gloria: Andrew Yang said we need solution providers. Web3 is all about seeing a problem and finding a new solution to it. It\u2019s okay to step away from the duality system and just think about how we can solve problems Umar: Andrew Yang\u2019s new \u2018Forward Party\u2019 has a lot of promise. Crypto takes right-wing libertarian values and left-wing welfare values and tries to make them compatible. Will be interesting to see how the Forward Party approaches this  https://www.forwardparty.com     What is public and what is private in terms of social support offered to DAO contributors? (as in govt vs corporate, not open vs secret)  In times of hardship (becoming a parent, medical emergencies, etc): financial, social, political support is so important to have. People often find support from their employers in the U.S where in other western countries (Canada, Europe) the government will offer more support/funding in times of hardship Ethereum is kind of a nation of its own and could be considered a governing body. Whose responsibility is it to provide social support systems? Individual DAOs, the ecosystem, outside bodies? Kevin Olsen: Communities could do this on the local level. Like within Gitcoin. There could also be unions for practice (like software engineers) which support each other. There needs to be trust for this to work Owocki: There\u2019s a meme that Ethereum is a Dark Forest. It\u2019s only a dark forest because you don\u2019t know who is around you \u2014 when you can\u2019t identify people then everyone is a potential adversary. When you start crossing smart contracts with decentralized identity then you can see what people have done on the blockchain and recognize them for their actions \u2014 shining a light on the people around you.  Check out the Metadreamer podcast on this topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqeeZwQr7TQ    Loie: What about not just people but entities, projects that exert influence over our lives? Theory of the firm: entities should dissipate into nothing once they are no longer needed Modular software design practices allow for plug-and-play infrastructure for communities. True Interoperability Need to be comfortable striding towards things that are not just short-term gains: education, healthcare, clean water. We should use composability for more than making money. Web3 is the great unlearning. You have to be comfortable unlearning what you\u2019re accustomed or made to believe. Money is just a unit of measurement \u2014 it\u2019s like stacking takeout menus but that doesn\u2019t make you full. Money is like saving inches. Moloch is inside all of us. We have imperfections and we need to block them with new programs. Encode our values into our money When you travel to new counties, you realize there are other systems of life. When deciding to fund a social system. Having a child is hard and only getting 6 weeks off to raise a newborn is incredibly hard. In Netherlands, they have 2 years. Need to compare systems and challenge ourselves to think of new systems or analyze more existing ones. If we need to disprove why something existing is the best way to do it then we get stuck. How do we make sure we don\u2019t get stuck in coordination processes as we make new governing models? We know existing bureaucracy takes forever We try and fail \u2014 we try to be fluid. We be honest about things working or not working. Open and honest to failure, instead of fearing it. Pondering too long could make the problem change to where a deeply-thought solution no longer works. Applying software practices to other areas of life Gloria: Parenting using Agile  If you think you\u2019re going to parent one way you\u2019ll probably fail. Adapt and see what works Onboard Gloria\u2019s son to gitcoin!! https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_feiler_agile_programming_for_your_family   The way in to Web3/DAO\u2019s may not be through money. Association to cryptocurrency is less appealing to many than lore, social empowerment. Sovereignty over wealth The Economy is something lots of kids/teenagers don\u2019t like. Money is a social construct. Values within a family are so much more collective than economic ones   Is Pizza a Public Good? PizzaDAO Grant is being discussed at FDD  Pizza is Finite,  Excludable and Rivalrous Begs the question: Should Gitcoin be determining if something is a public good or leave it to the community to determine? A nuanced view of public goods: most things aren\u2019t pure public or private goods. There are double-sided marketplaces. Like Ethereum: anyone can read, but it\u2019s pay to write. Reading is a public good but writing is a private good. PizzaDAO has received lots of community support and Gitcoin should leave it to the community to decide what receives quadratic funding https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/https-gitcoin-co-grants-5427-global-pizza-party-w-pizzadao-80e7ff40f42e4913815cec9b43fc6113 In discussing privacy coins:  Privacy favors the individual. Transparency favors the collective.    ",

Catch up on prior DAO Vibes by reading the notes below and be sure not to miss the next one in the Gitcoin Discord  Add Event to your calendar   4/6 DAO Vibezzz      Apologies to some of our members the audio did not record all voices  . We are trying to get this resolved for the next session.  Loie: What is the role or duty of an organization to help parents with childcare?  Anuj: Interesting conversation in today\u2019s public goods library (11 AM EST right before DAO Vibes in Discord!) and Lani probably has thoughts  Book of Essays from this talk: https://www.amazon.ca/Education-Time-Between-Worlds-Technology/dp/0986282677    Lani: Super interesting project looking at how to build local nooks/protocols to experiment with governance and parenting. Parents work in a coworking cafe where their kids can also play/learn together  Parents Nook on Twitter : https://twitter.com/Parents_Nook    Loie: Trying to develop a parental leave society. Need to expand the thought that you should get social support not just from your employer but from your community. Thinking about how we can make a model for the ecosystem. Could create matching for projects providing social support by the ecosystem \u2014 Ethereum as a nation. Annika: Very grateful to be here and as someone soon to be a parent it feels great that people are thinking about this Owocki: +1 this is super important to be an attractive place to work Owocki: 20 somethings in the audience may not care about childcare now but they will as they and the ecosystem mature. Have worked in startups from 22 to now, 37 Loie: What was the environment like when you were at a startup early on? Owocki: Long working hours would not have allowed for childcare Loie: We all have times in our lives when we need to take a step back and still deserve to have our needs met. It\u2019s okay to take time off from work. There will be a place to resume your role. Lots of benefits to both contributor and project. Wanting to talk to Lani who has ideas about DAO basic income. Lani: It\u2019s about building a culture of care, from the ground up within an organization. There\u2019s so much love here in Gitcoin. We get to ask these really fundamental questions about what\u2019s the purpose of DAO and what are intentions beyond financial sustainability? How do DAOs function as a post-nationstate entity? If everything could flow through local, contributors Gloria: So important to be able to feel like you can step back and take time for other priorities.  She takes care of her kids and aging parents and sometimes needs to be able to take the time to focus on them and herself. Eat that frog !  https://www.amazon.com/Eat-That-Frog-Great-Procrastinating/dp/162656941X     Loie: Was living in hometown for a while. It feels like there\u2019s no overlap between her web3 life and IRL life. Been in Europe for the last few weeks and the long days feel a lot easier in a communal hacker house. When the water heater broke, one of her housemates/colleagues offered to stay up and boil water for her \u2014 really touching.  Sameer: Sounds like the difference between a company and a community. Can really see the benefits of being in a community. There can also be some bad parts to it Colton: And in these visiting scenarios you always have the option to leave. In the art space, there are NFT spaces that don\u2019t have any IRL spaces. More and more of a need and a want for IRL places. Missing college\u2019s \u2018work hard, play hard\u2019 style and when the lines blur between colleague and family. Gloria: Would be great to have a multi-generational aspect to it. Like a space for kids to engage and be a part of things. A real-life space for parents and kids Armando: Maybe Gitcoin could have drop-in houses Seanmac: Or tag along with an existing one, have a partnership Lani: Definitely hit it on the head with the college feeling. Something powerful, and magical about being in person. Creating an Ethos throughout the organization of caring for people Gloria: DevCon in Bogota \u2014 might bring her kids   Anuj: Loie, how did that kindness touch you, how would you pay forward the person who stayed up to get you hot water? Loie: It\u2019s nice to extend similar kindness to others. She feeds people healthy meals and started a sauna Anuj: Community of care is so amazing. Has been experimenting with a group of people in Canada who brainstorm and do art based on crypto Colton: I feel like we all want to pack up and move into a hacker house now Anuj: Has a space for people like this \u2014  https://twitter.com/KindePayNFT?s=20&t=sCZoaaZ1uxXXHrT2Wo_YQQ  A place where people come together to think about kindness and create art   Loie: Favorite song \u201cAll is full of love\u201c which goes something like \u201cyou\u2019ll be given love. you\u2019ll be taken care of. it\u2019s all around you\u201d by Bjork  https://youtube.com/watch?v=wxBO28j3vug   Colton: intellectually warm to talk about love but feels so much nicer in person Sameer: helping people makes me more receptive to being helped Colton: Let\u2019s spread these vibes to the rest of Web3. Irl experiences really change hearts and minds Seanmac: Give And Take by Adam Grant changed his perspective and made him realize he used to be so giving but the corporate world took it from him. This book brought him back. Link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CAUH7UE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1  Garysheng: This book is about unlearning pathological mindsets. Gitcoin embodies the giving spirit. Sparking upward spirals. Giving feedback loops. Sameer: Kindness is a network effect that builds with more participants Lani: Evolving away from profit-centered motive and toward something ephemeral. Thank you Anuj for sharing a beautiful project Anuj: Kindness is about finding value in unexpected places Armando: Believes everything will enumerated in the end and in the power of RPGF Nano: Feels like he\u2019s getting the vibe and message of gitcoin today. As an artist, struggling to make money. Now feels like he doesn\u2019t have to do meaningless work that he hates. Wants to spread the word around about gitcoin. Got into Gitcoin by reading and talking to people, been involved with Memepalooza. Felt like he was being corrected and judged by society. But in Web3 he feels like he can be himself Umar: Lots of people can resonate with that feeling of being judged by society. Feels like this is a space where you\u2019re encouraged to bring your whole identity.   Umar: How can I help create a community of care for coworkers who have kids?  Lani: Awareness and Compassion are a beautiful place to begin Gloria: Just being aware that in any moment someone might need something from me. Giving people extra wiggle room to respond or recording calls. Also, especially IRL, being okay with play. Kids are very playful. Also being aware that people are multifaceted, not just parents. Armando: Glad to hear the words \u2018love\u2019 and \u2018care\u2019. These are values that men aren\u2019t always encouraged to talk about but they are important values and I\u2019m glad they are discussed in the open in Web3 Loie: when she sees kids in the video call, usually feels like the parent has an auto reaction that their kids shouldn\u2019t be in the frame. her response is to welcome the little moment of participation from the kids. Wave and say hello   Gloria: Take your kid to work day would be really cool. Her son is bubbly and likes talking to people. Remembers a call when her kid was trying to talk to Kyle\u2019s kid while her and Kyle were having a meeting. They had to throw in the towel and let their kids talk. Having the space to reschedule the meeting without being stressed was really great Lani + Sean: Maybe we need a side room for kids in zoom Loie: It\u2019s not disrespectful to eat in meetings or have kids in meetings. It\u2019s part of being human and we should bring that to work Nanopunk: Kids were welcomed in recording studios. Now, welcomes kids to podcast making them aware of violence against women. Loves having kids in the spce   David: All this talk of warming water reminds me of an old buddhist saying. A young grasshopper asks a senior guru \u201chow do I become enlightened?\u201d. The guru says \u201ccarry water and chop wood.\u201d After 20 years, the grasshopper comes back and says \u201cI\u2019ve been carrying water and chopping wood for 20 years. Now what do I do?\u201d and the guru says \u201ccarry water and chop wood.\u201d  No matter how we change through life, those base chores remain the same. It turns out it\u2019s how we do things not what we do that really matters.  ",
