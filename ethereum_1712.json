                    "content": "Here is a summary of the session that I wrote from the notes on the whiteboard\u2026  UX session notes - OG council, Amsterdam 2022-04-24 The session discussed UX in general. There is a \u201cwhiteboard note\u201d that tried to capture some of the discussion, and I am attempting to decipher that here. Questions / Topics:   What do we mean by UX?   What are the problems?  What are examples of better UX, and why? And worse UX?     Why does it matter? So what do we want to do?   What do we mean? What we mean is trivially described as \u201cmaking things simple\u201d. Key questions we noted include:  Do users achieve what they want? Do users achieve what we want them to achieve? Are people spending time doing tasks that could be automated away? Are people comfortable working with the system? More than with other alternatives?   What are the problems? We identified a few barriers to usability:  Fear\u2026  \u2026of the consequences of a mistake. Web3 systems are unforgiving compared to e.g. bank accounts or credit cards  \u2026of being embarrassed     Language and accessibility issues  Many systems are command line based, and often error messages are generic rather than informative, or are excessively \u201ccryptic\u201d.  The other major interface pattern is using Web apps. Here there is available knowledge and guidance on how to improve: WCAG, W3C\u2019s i18n work, \u2026     Technical issues:  Performance is unpredictable, but also there is rarely feedback on how long things take, how they are progressing\u2026  Errors are obscure (see above: accessibility and language issues)       Better UX examples  Uniswap Grid+ Pryzm POAP Dappnode Wallets (but with the caveat that they aren\u2019t generally great UX) \u201cpoint and click\u201d interfaces  These can be built with Web technology for which there is significant work avaialable on how to provide better user experience but there is a concern that these can hide problems, or make security properties hard to discover.     Worse UX examples  Ethereum clients  Essentially Eth1 / Execution clients  Command Line is not how people usually operate software in this century     Being surprised at fees for multiple transactions Trying to run a node, and interact with it from other applications   Why UX matters  There are alternative platforms. If they are easier to work with, they will attract capital, projects, mindshare, and developers that would otherwise consider the Ethereum ecosystem as a natural home. Provides confidence in the ecosystem, which in turn encourages investment and the creation of a larger community of developers in a \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d - a feedback loop that encourages growth of the ecosystem. It\u2019s necessary to achieve the often-claimed goals of enabling decentralisation and improving democratisation It can help people understand security better, and so make fewer mistakes.   So, what next?  We encourage people to publish the results of research into usability in our space. It would be nice to see simplified interfaces that provide all the information a user needs to complete an action (i.e. they won\u2019t be surprised halfway through), and does not require them to manually do things that are unnecessary. It would be nice to have more \u201ceasy entry simulations\u201d - e.g. going through the process of a transaction, or of adding a contract to a network, without incurring the costs of it happening \u201cfor real\u201d \u2026  ",
