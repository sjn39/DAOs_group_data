Maybe someone at MakerDAO is working on a solution to bring DAI back to the peg - I\u2019m not aware of it. My question is: Is there any short-term parameter/measure/action that can be taken to bring DAI back to $1.00? If there is none, then this system\u2019s design has to be improved. If the only measure left is to lower the SF to 0, then MakerDAO should \u201cencourage\u201d that vote in the same way as it is \u201cencouraging\u201d lowering the DC, adding USDC as collateral etc. If there is no direct way to influence the peg at this time, then the DAI users and the community can be informed more directly (a blog/reddit post?) about that so that they can make more informed choice about buying/using/trading DAI. From the last governance meeting (@Vishesh):  It\u2019s still locked into that inverse pattern. Which tells me the peg is not yet ready to let go of its correlation to ETH. When that decoupling happens, which I\u2019m reasonably confident it will at some point, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll see it return to a Dollar. We\u2019re not quite there yet and you can\u2019t rush that return to peg. It would be difficult.  Since lowering the SF is not mentioned -  does that mean that we can just wait (\u201cnot rushing it\u201d) and hope? If I don\u2019t get new insights here that could change my mind, I\u2019ll start a signal vote for the on-chain poll with the question: \u201cLower the SF to 0 (yes/no)\u201d. In the \u201cReview\u201d section the explanation (arguments for/against) will be given in the same way as it is done for the Vault Compensation Poll (https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmwfvvguaf8rz8xwgv2cqnzzt9t5h6epzh17qmk2ue99y4). If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to lower the SF to 0, please write here and I\u2019ll add that info to the \u201cArguments against\u201d section. ",
