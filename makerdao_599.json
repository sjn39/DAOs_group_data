                    "content": "Disclaimer: This is my personal stance and does not represent PECU views. Part II: Against the burn. In this short writeup, I want to convince you, dear Maker holder, why increasing Surplus Buffer is the right strategy to ensure long-term growth of the protocol. TLDR: SB allows for more experimentation and increases future protocol revenues. Surplus Buffer is where protocol revenue (DAI) is stored. When it\u2019s full, MKR buy auctions (flap) are started, and revenue is used to decrease MKR supply, thus increase MKR price (at least in theory). In case of bad debt, the surplus buffer is spent first before triggering MKR mint auctions (flop) that try to raise missing funds to cover the debt. I don\u2019t want to argue here whether MKR burn works and has a positive effect on the price action. However, I think we have clear evidence (Black Thursday) that MKR mint auctions (flop) have a devastating impact on MKR price, and governance should do everything to prevent that.  Surplus buffer as a growth fuel Big Surplus Buffer fuels future protocol growth by allowing us to get involved in riskier endeavors without risking flop auctions. There is a ton of riskier activities that DAO can do:  onboard interest-bearing versions of existing tokens to allow leveraged farming - Abracadabra money style, deploy slave MCD instances not only on L2 chains but also on sidechains and other L1s - deploy on Polygon and tap into the retail market, enable more DAI Wormholes on riskier domains and improve DAI velocity and usefulness, enable the protocol to deploy liquidity where it\u2019s needed - ex. become L2 uniswap LP to help bootstrap DAI usage on a new domain,  Assuming that these activities have independent risk of total failure, debt ceilings of a size of the whole surplus buffer can be used to cap exposure for each of these. This way we can prevent these activities from becoming an existential threat to the protocol, yet still tap into new markets. For example, given a SB of size of 250M DAI. We could invite Yearn\u2019s interest-bearing ETH with a debt ceiling of 250M. At the same time we could deploy MCD slave instances on Polygon and Avanalche, both with 250M and make use of whatever collateral is available there. Failure of all of these at the same time is quite unlikely but definitely, we should monitor compounding risks (ie. make sure that Yearn doesn\u2019t farm on Polygon at the same time). Each new vault would generate revenue back to the protocol, further fueling SB growth. By constantly adjusting debt ceilings and SB for these riskier assets we can grow these cashflows; thus the more significant Surplus Buffer becomes the more revenue it generates. This can be rephrased as \u201cSB can be put into productive use by allowing the DAO doing more risky stuff without actually worrying about flop actions\u201d.  Summary I believe that Maker is in the place where we shouldn\u2019t seek short-sighted gains by burning MKR but rather reinvest in growth. Increasing SB is the simplest way to do that. This doesn\u2019t mean a decrease in MKR price, quite contrary I believe. By focusing on future growth, the value of MKR should increase in the eyes of many investors. A perfect example here is Amazon, which never issued any dividends but it is still one of the most valuable stocks in the world. Burning MKR now is like preferring cents today rather than millions in few years. If you agree with me, please vote in favor of a high SB in any future governance voting. 250M recently voted in is fine for now in my opinion but we shouldn\u2019t be burning MKR again anytime soon.

                    "content": "personal opinions here too I quite strongly agree with Kris, and would like to offer some additional food for thought to those that prefer more aggressive burning.   I\u2019m not opposed to buy-and-burn as way to return capital to token holders (in fact, it\u2019s quite tax- and gas-efficient). However, there are times when it makes sense, and times when it doesn\u2019t. Kris gave the example of Amazon; I\u2019ll give a different example, Google. Google pays no dividend, but has in recent years done massive stock buybacks. However, it did NOT do these during its early years, when it was fighting to win the search market and scale along with the internet. I believe Maker now is much more analogous to early Google than late Google, in terms of needing to grow, innovate, and evolve along with DeFi.   I frequently see people express thinking along the lines of \u201cthere\u2019s no way price can go up if we aren\u2019t burning\u201d or \u201cwhy would I hold MKR if burns aren\u2019t happening\u201d. This is not a complete picture of how assets should be valued. Whether or not the protocol is actively buying and burning MKR, token holders are collectively entitled to all future cash flows of the protocol and all current assets held. This allows one to assign a value to MKR even if it isn\u2019t distributing cash flows to holders directly. In crypto, the future is very uncertain, which leads to a large speculative premium for assets that seem promising, and this effect generally overwhelms current cash flow+assets at this market stage. Wisely reinvesting while guarding against black swans could in fact increase MKR\u2019s speculative premium, leading to more appreciation than buying and burning. Would you rather invest in an ant that works industriously to protect and increase capital, or a grasshopper that fiddles it away?   The risk profile of burning is very asymmetric, and not in a good way. Accruing bad debt greatly reduces the market value of MKR, generally leading to much more inflation in a flop auction than the deflation from the burning of an equivalent surplus. The Risk team has essentially told us that the surplus buffer is dangerously low compared to the amount of volatile assets we have. As US monetary conditions continue to tighten, geopolitical tensions rise, and markets collectively awaken from their speculative COVID fever dream, we could soon see crypto prices much lower than we anticipate. ETH is close to 50% off its high\u2013now imagine it 60% lower from here. If you say that\u2019s impossible\u2013I hope you\u2019re right. For me, now is not the time to throw caution to the wind. If I can only pick two of three from (growth, insurance, burning)\u2013I\u2019m picking growth+insurance.   Some ways surplus can be put to work, beyond just keeping us safe from a crypto meltdown:    backstop risky experiments along the lines Kris describes bootstrap protocol-owned liquidity in pairs like DAI-MKR, DAI-ETH, or MKR-ETH fund new core units (e.g. legal) or research into longer-term strategic efforts like a purpose-built rollup just for DAI payments   I doubt this applies to those dedicated enough to be reading these forum posts, but I\u2019ve definitely run into people with short-term outlooks who seem to want the price to go up, as quickly as possible, and they argue for burns as they think that achieves the quickest price increase. While I make a case in my second point that buying-and-burning is not necessarily optimal for making \u201cnumber go up\u201d, I\u2019d like to make a separate point here\u2013which is that catering to such attitudes can create a vicious cycle where short-term thinking comes to dominate the Maker governance process. Such people have my sympathy if they\u2019ve overinvested, by a lot*, but I don\u2019t think their desire for quick results should be allowed to override more strategic thinking for the ultimate success of Maker.  * for those who don\u2019t use Twitter an unhealthy amount: this is a reference to a popular meme ",

However, I think we have clear evidence (Black Thursday) that MKR mint auctions (flop) have a devastating impact on MKR price, and governance should do everything to prevent that.   If we are going to be using this argument we should at least pause for a second to consider why flop auctions have such a devastating impact on MKR price. In a normal situation minting MKR simply dilutes the rights to profit among more holders. I.e. if you increase supply by 10% you reduce the value of each individual MKR by around 10%. What happened on Black Thursday was something else though. It was an event that shook the confidence in MKR as an asset. The price of MKR as with any asset is in large part dependent on what investors believe this asset is capable of. So when you combine the effect of people losing faith in you with being forced to sell more tokens, of course the price of your tokens are going to tank. Any investor is going to ask themselves \u201cwhy should I put my money and trust in these guys\u201d? As long as the answer is \u201cI believe this token is going to be worth more in the future than it is right now\u201d that investor might buy more MKR tokens. As such I think the focus on preventing flops in of it self is the wrong answer. What we need to do is address the concerns potential investors have on our ability and our intention to deliver value. Why is Tesla stocks sky high? Because they promise the moon and then deliver on their promises. From a MKR holders perspective the way Maker is acting right now is like the stoner kid you borrowed money to that promises he will pay you back, always has an excuse not to do it yet somehow always has money for pot.     krzkaczor:  Each new vault would generate revenue back to the protocol, further fueling SB growth. By constantly adjusting debt ceilings and SB for these riskier assets we can grow these cashflows; thus the more significant Surplus Buffer becomes the more revenue it generates. This can be rephrased as \u201cSB can be put into productive use by allowing the DAO doing more risky stuff without actually worrying about flop actions\u201d.   This would represent a radical departure from the stated intention of the surplus buffer. The system we now have in place returns capital from MakerDAO to the MKR holder. That MKR holder is free to put that capital to work in any risk profile they may deem fit. Having MakerDAO take on that risk changes the fundamental nature of Maker. Of course, any return on the surplus buffer would be an improvement over the, to quote Jeremy Powell, \" inflation that is well-above our 2 % long-run goal\". However, the surplus buffer has always been touted as the first line of defense against bad debt and as such the primary function should be to retain its DAI value. Or to put it in other words, it seems ill advised to gamble with our insurance money. Following up suggestions to utilize the stability buffer for yields would also mean engineering and opportunity costs. Unless those costs results in higher average gains on capital than what we\u2019re currently doing we should not even contemplate them. On the topic of faith in the protocol I think we need to recognize that there are different perspectives on just how convinced they are in the long term viability of the protocol. People who are deeply integrated into it, like say Core Unit members, or large long term holders of MKR, will naturally have a greater faith in the protocol. Smaller MKR holders, and less active community members will have a lower faith that their interests are being taken care of and of the long term viability of holding MKR in general. That means that when the community goes back on an earlier promise, we will see an exodus of people with less faith. We\u2019ve even seen an exodus of larger MKR holders over the past year. ",

Some unstructured thoughts on that:  The argument for capital use efficiency (i.e. buybacks should only happen after the fastest growth phase) works even if right now Maker does not exactly know how to use that capital. I think that\u2019s an organisational problem and having a large amount of ammunition available once the machine has started working smoothly will be extremely valuable. There should be a new meme to separate \u201cSB\u201d and \u201cDAI Treasury\u201d. Once risk&governance have decided on an SB target, the question is what Maker does with the rest of the DAI. It could be lerped to burning. Or to a treasury. Or to buyback-but-dont-burn.

Of course it will take a lot more manpower (maybe some increases in salary and bonuses because you know, the market is competitive) but isn\u2019t it so great we have money to spare right now? \u2014- Maker was a great idea from the outset.  It makes sense.  People pay fees for a stable coin to be stable and have trust in a system that is backed by collateral.  Those fees get returned to the protocol through buybacks. However, after the initial launch?  It\u2019s just not clear how development has equated to growth.  We know that there are things to be done.  Things to be fixed.  Things to be maintained.  Even things to be added.  So of course, everyone is willing to pay for growth and maintenance.  But every single request should be vetted and understood before capital is allocated.  That\u2019s the promise of maker governance.  A big fat and juicy surplus buffer that\u2019s just there for the taking and bursting with more than what\u2019s needed?  That\u2019s allocating capital to some nebulous future proposal that supposedly will stimulate lots of growth.  If the project had a great track record of delivering on promises quickly, I suppose this might fly (perhaps in the early days after launch).  But at this point?  A lot of trust has already been lost watching all the other new and exciting competitors rise up.  Maker is not the only project out there doing what it does.  And sometimes it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s keeping up.  Its biggest advantage is being first mover and having a large moat with other projects having already integrated with it. Anyway, bottom line, the premise behind the name surplus buffer is that it\u2019s a buffer.  It\u2019s supposed to reduce risk of a catastrophic event that destroys value in the system.  It\u2019s not supposed to be a fund to be used for random future projects.  I\u2019ve never liked the fact that expenses are paid from it but I understand that it\u2019s an easy mechanism for it.  All this talk of just of stopping the burn and using the surplus buffer for other uses really hurts trust that people have placed in this protocol. ",

I will not repeat what others already said in the thread, but I highly agree with arguments brought up by Krzkaczot and Kurt. Burning tokens does not reward all token holders equally; larger holders get higher benefit, because they can\u2019t easily exit their position without large slippage, while smaller holders can exit much faster and cheaper. So basically we can burn for a long time at the current rate, and then some whale decides to dump, and all the price increase from burning is erased, like it never happened, because the whale took the benefit of it for himself. Burning also rewards short-term speculators/traders more than long-term holders. Long-term holders believe future cash flow will be larger than it is today and therefore do not really care too much about current price, or will buy more when price drops. Short-term speculators think price will pump in the next two hours, days, weeks or months because of reasons, one of them being demand from burning. The future potential will be achieved faster and with higher probability if we do not burn now, while short-term price will be slightly higher over time if we burn now. Therefore, burning now rewards speculation more than long-term investment. Long-term holders tend to have higher interest in the project and will invest more effort into participating in the community, voting, etc, than speculators. Assuming there wouldn\u2019t be any legal and tax problems with it, the flat dividends in dai would be a much more equal mechanism for all token holders. Burning is like constantly reinvesting dividends into your position, while some holders may not want that, and would prefer to spend/invest otherwise. Under the burning mechanism, as supply shrinks, the only way to harvest the benefit of burn is to sell a portion of your holdings, while with the dividends, you don\u2019t need to sell anything to have something right away. So the burning in a way, incentivizes holders to constantly sell small portions. I am not suggesting we should introduce dividends, just wanted to use this to explain how burning does not equal dividends as a mechanism. I feel like burning and obsession with supply in crypto communities is a living fossil from the early days, when Bitcoin and Bitcoin forks were the only thing in crypto and all the good stuff about having a provably scarce asset. Back then layer 1 blockchain was the only topic, and supply schedule was one of the most important things. Today we are way past that, we are not dealing only with native blockchain assets, but have tokens that represent different things than the native blockchain asset. We know from several examples of liquidity mining schemes and airdrops, that increasing supply for a limited amount can have great benefits for growth, marketing and subsequently price of the asset itself and more diverse ownership structure. I see no reason why we would want to burn now, when the cash flow is much smaller than it will be in the future, other than this mentioned obsession with supply being the most important thing ever and we just need to burn blindly, because burn=price go up. Burning had a good marketing effect until now, but currently we do not really benefit from it, while we could have higher growth, better products and more robust security for everyone in the ecosystem.

Growth for the protocol is what we need to be targeting not short-term returns. This growth requires additional core units, additional contributors, research, etc all of which will require lots of capital. We may also want to participate in more risky experimental lending schemes which could fail, so a healthy surplus buffer is necessary as an insurance fund.   As the world awakes from the speculative mania bubble the Fed has created with 0% interest rates, we will see crypto prices depreciate considerably. This will cause a few things to happen. As prices fall, users will reduce their Dai debt (either voluntarily or forcefully through liquidation). Lower debt leads to lower revenue unless we can make up for it with rate increases. If \u2018number no go up\u2019 in crypto markets, demand for new Dai generation will taper. A large surplus buffer will be critical to give us the flexibility we need for growth.   The other problem is that due to how illiquid MKR is, flop auctions (the dilution of MKR to cover bad debt) are extremely hard for the protocol to pull off successfully, ESPECIALLY at scale. The protocol could have a hundred million dollars of bad debt on its balance in the event of a market meltdown. We will not find a buyer who\u2019s going to buy $100M worth of MKR. Surplus buffer as an insurance fund is critical, it\u2019s literally an existential risk for the protocol to not do so.   So how do we grow in a bear market? I see two ways.   Ensure sustained inflows of crypto from non-DeFi platforms to DeFi platforms (and in particular Maker). Especially ETH and WBTC of which the protocol currently has 2.24% and 21.92% of the supply respectively. The Growth CU is taking the lead on this and making deals with some big players in the space.   Go balls to the wall on Real World Assets. There is such a huge amount of assets in the traditional markets that if we even captured a fraction of a percent could lead to triple digit annual growth regardless of a bull or bear market. Real World Assets are criminally underfunded by the DAO relative to the potential upside.   ",

About a year ago I put a little presentation together where i tried to find some reasonable values of VaR based on the debt issued at that time. Keep in mind that there has been a >100% growth in DAI issued since so if that analysis was performed again the numbers that you\u2019d find would likely be higher now. You can find a link to the governance call and the slideshow here. The TLDR from that presentation was that the models indicated the protocol is likely to see a > $85MM loss sometime in the next 5 years. Ideally (imo at least) the stability buffer should be in a place where it might be able to absorb a loss on that magnitude, and needless to say it isn\u2019t there yet. I will say, I\u2019m not 100% sold that MKR burning needs to be halted full stop. I do think that it makes for good optics to keep the burner going even if it is only at a trivial level, and arguably MKR is quite cheap right now. That said though, I simultaneously think that the situation with capital markets generally is pretty uneasy right now, and based on my best estimates the protocol is likely ill prepared to fully absorb a large sell off so squirreling away more into the protocol\u2019s rainy day fund is likely prudent. Overall I\u2019m torn but this (stability buffer should be larger) argument certainly has merit. ",

That being said I do not see why the Surplus Buffer should keep growing with no return for token holders. The comparison with Google and Amazon is in my eyes simply not correct. Typical growth stocks, Google and Amazon being two such examples, are able to use surplus cash to grow the business. Maker, on the other hand, is constrained by organizational issues that must be solved before serious growth is an option. OP @krzkaczor makes several examples of how a larger Surplus Buffer would enable more aggressive growth options, but I fail to see why any of them need an USD 250 million buffer to be initiated. The cash to implement the proposals is already there, what is lacking is a strategy document so we don\u2019t just start random initiatives as well as able hands to execute. I trust @Rune to at some point come up with the first item. The second issue - how to get more human resources to enable higher growth, again I do not see the link to the Surplus Buffer. At least presently the problem is not available funds but the lack of people with the required skillset. Please correct me if I am wrong. The only case where the size of the Surplus Buffer matters is if @NikKunkel is correct and the market implodes to such a degree that we need the Surplus Buffer simply to pay people. I think this scenario is where the urge to must-growth-the-Surplus-Buffer gets most of its psychological energy. The best solution would be to split off a portion of the Surplus Buffer and call it the Salary Buffer. Apart from that, the portion of any surplus that goes to either buffers or token holders will at some point have to be settled by a MIP. Having token holders and Core Units constantly argue over surplus distribution is no way to grow value. ",

I think it is getting a bit blurry though, as there are many different goals combined in this post. I see Salary Buffer, Investment options, Bear market risk protection, and more. It might make sense to split it out so it\u2019s more clear with what purpose certain funds are held. One thing I really would like to emphasize that I think is missing from this discussion, is that I think the initial request by @krzkaczor can be met in many different ways. The request is to have money available to do more & potentially more risky innovations. Personally I think many MKR holders do not know what kind of trade-offs are made within the core unit work which cause that certain directions are now NOT being taken due to a lack of money to put at risk. I believe that many here, and within the broader MKR community would be very happy to invest more money if it is needed to do some awesome innovative things. So please, if money is the problem, create a proposal for it and let\u2019s freaking do it! ",

Let me give you a very specific (and simplified) example here. Later this year we will be done with \u201cslave\u201d MCD instances. This means we will be able to deploy MCD on any new domain with low effort and cap maximum exposure with debt ceilings. Assume that each deployment yields 2% yearly on a debt ceiling by providing loans using native domain collateral and wormhole fees (I think it\u2019s rather pessimistic variant). If you would ask me a few months ago about it, I\u2019d say that we should deploy only on real L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync and Starkware (different codebase though\u2026) because anything else comes with a multi-sig risk. Now I believe that we could deploy on these more risky domains but keep our exposure below SB not to risk flop actions when multisig bridge rugs us. Assuming that we could deploy on all L1/sidechains with EVM compatibility: Polygon, xDAI (Gnosis chain), Avalanche, Moonbeam, Fantom (and probably others) we can yield 5*2%=10% out of SB. I don\u2019t know about you but I would prefer to earn 10% from 250M rather than 10% from 68M (current SB). This only takes into account, yields only from these new, riskier (not L2) domains. We could probably find similar examples with new RWA structures etc. This not only brings additional revenue to the DAO but helps us to stay relevant in the whole DeFi space. ",

I represent the defi old guard that invested personally and professionally in a protocol and not a company. I want to see the system automated to the greatest extent possible so that it can perform computational tasks on a blockchain that generate value and return that value to it\u2019s users. I don\u2019t deny that means that there will be maintenance costs for upkeep on the things that aren\u2019t automated, and research costs to further automate and even expand the money machine, but beyond that, everything extra should be returned to the investors. When the surplus buffer is full, if Maker holders want to spend on growth, by all means spend on growth, but holding on to an enormous pile of assets pegged to a rapidly depreciating currency is just silly. I\u2019m not sure what endless growth for Maker means. To me, I can see problems on the horizon with Maker trying to grow faster than is sustainable by hiring too fast and trying to do too much at once that ultimately ends in catastrophe. I\u2019d advocate steady, sustainable growth, with some small percent of interim profits being returned to holders. Some of the others here have mentioned that burning MKR was the profit mechanism that many believed was part of Maker\u2019s social contract. By not repaying profits to MKR holders and introducing individual decisionmaking into the process some are attempting to change the narrative and turn Maker from a software protocol into an organization led by busybodies. Frankly, that\u2019s not interesting to me, as the world is full of organizations I can invest in that are far less risky and far more profitable. The beauty of this technology is that it allows us to create software that can be operated independently of human action or intermediaries, and I think we should strive to maintain that in spirit. The surplus buffer is there, by all means dip in and use it to pay for (sustainable) growth and development, but don\u2019t change the social contract; depending on who you ask there will never be a good time to burn, there will always be more room to grow, more things to spend money on, more layers to deploy to; no matter how large the protocol gets.

As now a delegate who has owned some (not much MKR, long story) MKR for quite some time and is probably almost 2x as old as the average person commenting here is my take on this issue. For quite some time I thought the whole issue 1M MKR and buy it back was appealing and would lead to significant MKR price appreciation. Simple answer here - IT HASN\u2019T and isn\u2019t. Maker, when I began to notice it, was worth about $1000 when ETH was maybe $150.   There was maybe 100M SAI in existence backed by MKR worth about 1B at the time. By the time Maker released the MCD this market cap was about 600M (give or take a $600 MKR price) and DAI rapidly rose to about 150M.    Then Black Thursday comes along.  Maker SB ends up with a 6M hole and needs to flop, but guess what there isn\u2019t any DAI liquidity.  So governance froze flop auctions on a suggestion from myself eventually supported by others floated a USDC vault just to get some DAI liquidity possible for flopping and lined up buyers.    We auctioned what ~20K MKR at a rough average of $280 to cover a 6M loss to the protocol. Realize at the time this was barely a 4% of all DAI loss that cost the protocol 320M in Market Cap on MKR.   Maker rode through this and came back better than ever right? Wrong.   Today the MKR market cap is 2.2B and we have 10B now floated.   If we have a 4% loss event today (or 400M) and this only crushed the Market cap 1.1B worth I would consider this a triumph.   Frankly I don\u2019t think it would be a easy pill to swallow to sell 400M DAI worth of MKR as the inflation even at $1000/MKR (unlikely price btw) would be 400K MKR or 40%, at $400/MKR it would be 1M more MKR or 100% inflation and a price drop of 80% all to manage a mere 4% loss. The whole point of MKR is to be the manager of the system, and to be responsible not just to MKR holders but to DAI holders.   Everyone keeps looking at this system from MKR holder point of view but take a look at this from a DAI holder point of view. 10B DAI now is backed by over 60% stablecoins. 10B DAI is backed by 2.2B worth of MKR that barely has any liquidity on any exchanges btw. 10B DAI is backed by a surplus buffer of 60M (that is .6%, about the same amount as on BT by the way) Maker is looking to grow not just to 10B but to 100B and beyond.   How in the heck can we look at our MKR and the state of the system and NOT think that today - for MKR and DAI holders we don\u2019t need to increase the SB substantially to allow for the growth we want? How can we look at ourselves and not start thinking about building trading liquidity by investing in MKR-DAI v2 LP (DAO owned LP) building trading and backing liquidity in DAI for MKR, but also building a much larger SB? Flopping MKR once killed the MC over 50% for a DAI loss relative to outstanding of 4%.   Isn\u2019t it actually better for MKR holders to build a system that never needs to flop again, by not flapping for a while?   Is MKR by being greedy and looking for flash in the pan return actually doing a disservice to all the DAI that exists? I for a long time believed flapping was a good thing.   It is a \u2018feel good\u2019 thing, but not economically a good thing, not for MKR holders and especially not for anyone who wants to see DAI become the strongest, best and biggest store of value out there. If you want this \u2018safe\u2019 \u2018secure\u2019 protocol that is careful and invests only in very sure things.   There is an investment for you called Berkshire Hathaway BKR-A, or if you want some more risk try AAPL.   Look at the real movers in the space,  Apple, google, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft each of these over their early history didn\u2019t pay dividends but instead took cash to grow their companies.   There are various reasons for this that all led to them becoming powerhouses.   One of them was that this cash for acquisitions and cross investments which effectively grew their businesses.   Maker is what 7 years old and is barely a 100M revenue grosser with a product portfolio barely 10B in another 10 years maybe it is 1B grosser with 1T+ in product portfolio. If Maker doesn\u2019t focus on growth here, we could rapidly be left in the dust.    Maker doesn\u2019t need to reduce MKR by buying and burning.  It needs to build liquidity via MKR-DAI v2 LP, and to build a SB warchest to allow for safe growth.   In time as revenues, SB and yes a DAO owned treasury of LP assets grows then MKR value will begin to be reflected in MKR price which if my calculations are correct will be reflected in the DAO owned MKR-DAI LP with 20-30-50% of all MKR liquidity paired at DAI price and robust trading markets and a growing set of treasury assets earning us return. I posit that less MKR right now isn\u2019t a good thing, more cash guarding against DAI losses allowing us to taking on more loans IS. I used to support burn, now I think we have a great many more important things to purpose DAI and MKR with than just tossing away DAI to burn MKR and Maker Market Cap. I am in strong support of this thesis and thank you @krzkaczor for bringing this forward for discussion. ",

DAI growth on L2s and possibly sidechains. Because even a 4% loss hit on the SB in the past (6M) caused a 320M Market cap loss in Maker.   I would much rather have 250M in the SB than face a 1-1.5B hit in Maker Market Cap. RWA.   We are going to need a backing buffer to any potential RWA losses. As you say yourself as backing cash for operations.  Now is not the time to piss away SB DAI by burning MKR no matter how \u2018feel good\u2019 it is.   We are not banking anything by buying MKR here.   It is far better to take our excess DAI and pair it with treasury MKR into a Uniswap v2 LP and then allow borrowing on that than to just toss away the DAI and burn the MKR. Maker hasn\u2019t even started building a Treasury which is something I advocated for years ago. What we have learned in the past is that MKR MC is a poor way to back losses in the SB and governance would do well to work to create multiple buffers to having to ever flop.  Increasing the SB now is the easiest fastest way.  As this grows we can think about DAO owned MKR-DAI LP (which I think we need now btw), an ETH reserve and likely (ETH-USDC + ETHDAI v2 LP so we can earn fees there by putting emergency ETH to work with DAI and possibly USDC), and other stuff like an ENS-DAI v2 LP, etc.   Here if we build enough treasury reserves earning fees and create vaults to borrow against these instead of flopping MKR for DAI we basically use our treasury and vaults to borrow DAI to cover losses or raise cash for new investments.

I always think that you and others like you keep the system in balance. Thanks in hindsight for the Black Thursday actions. Unfortunately you make the mistake of thinking that the majority are rational when they are not. The majority want to see immediate results, quick profits, that\u2019s why they invest. And no matter how rational your long term perspective is you won\u2019t get there if you fail in today. Theoretically you are right, but you can fail if others grow faster, absorb your markets and your investors. Or people will leave because they see you saying this today and doing that tomorrow. So you need some kind of balance in the system, which is growing quite fast today, but has a long term perspective like you\u2019re talking about, and communicates more or less the same direction. It\u2019s a nice trilemma. ps: do you remember? I wonder how many \u201cun- or under-banked\u201d people have a Maker vault on L1 today\u2026  image1388\u00d7561 65.8 KB  ",
