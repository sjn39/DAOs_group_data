I noticed that there\u2019s a 27% TIN/DROP buffer for CF but only a 19% buffer for NS. As I understand it, the higher the percent of TIN (senior tranche), the less risk to Maker (DROP) holders. If that\u2019s right, shouldnt there be less risk associated with Console Freight - which would mean a lower stability fee (right now it\u2019s stability fee is higher than NS) ? Or do other things influence the stability fee that make CF more risky? https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/pool/0xdB3bC9fB1893222d266762e9fF857EB74D75c7D6/consolfreight-4 https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/pool/0x53b2d22d07E069a3b132BfeaaD275b10273d381E/new-silver-2 ",

This is not however enough to understand the risk of the pool and hence the reward we might require. In this case, ConsolFreight underlying loans are riskier than New Silver. You can see the yield of the underlying loans to get a sense of the risk (higher the yield, higher the risk). Other factors, like the diversification of borrowers, history of the Asset Originator, \u2026, play a role as well. @williamr is working on a framework that will allow us to clearly price the DROP SF with the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and the pool parameters. That will be helpful as well. ",

                    "content": "@PaperImperium It is important to highlight a couple of things in a normal securitisation process. Given the structuring has been done appropriately, the focus of the securitisation (and investment) is in the pool of assets securitised and their respective risk profile, even more so than on the issuer/originator to an extent. In practical terms, this means that you can actually have in theory and in practice an issuer with a lower credit risk grade than the grade of the assets that were sold to the SPV. Hence why the characteristics of the asset pool and their risk profile is so important. Here the comparison is between the underlying short-term mortgages (NewSilver) and trade invoices (ConsolFreight). Historically, probability of default in home loans is lower than in trade finance. Not only that, but once loans default (usually at 90 dpd for HL), the recovery rate on HLs is also higher on average than trade invoices. If you were to sell a mortgage due to foreclosure, you\u2019re very likely to recover more than 80% of its value at sale (even significantly more) whereas in trade finance your recovery rate will likely be much lower on average for an unpaid trade invoice, and very dependent on the underlying demand for the specific goods in the liquidation market. Often, recovery rates in trade finance do not reach 70%, if that. This also partially explains why credit enhancements (overcollateralisation, first loss equity etc) on riskier asset pools tend to be higher for trade invoices than for a pool of mortgage loans. Saying that, for an equal risk profile and asset class (e.g. across trade finance pools), the proposition to have a more \u201cdynamic\u201d pricing (SF) proportional to leverage is an interesting one. E.g. For reduced leverage (i.e. higher equity portion) we \u201cnudge\u201d issuers to de-risk their pools. This needs some analysis. But I wouldn\u2019t advice such dynamic mechanism across pools with different underlying asset classes. ",
