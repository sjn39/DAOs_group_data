                    "content": "Dear MakerDAO voter, As we move through the pre-launch phase of the EndGame plan, I would like to briefly describe where GovComms sees itself heading in the next six months. The GovComms CU has a mandate to improve information accessibility and coordination at Maker. We believe there will be valuable ways for us to contribute on those fronts with the upcoming Scopes, DVCs, Frameworks, Tribunals, Councils, MetaDAOs, and more. It is our view that a move to ecosystem actor may be the best course of action, as we can independently propose project-based engagements to both MakerCore and others in the ecosystem\u2013functioning as a powerful supporting player in this new world. We are also considering other options, such as breaking up and supporting groups from within. While our future is in limbo, one thing is certain: we are eager to see this all come together and will do everything we can to increase Maker\u2019s probability of success. Our mandate is to provide support to Maker Core, and we intend to continue doing so through what we hope will be a relatively smooth transition. If we have support, over the coming months we will continue executing our active programs with an emphasis on the Core\u2019s needs as they relate to the endgame structure that is emerging, all while we wind down and pivot to a new way of contributing within those six months. It is our hope that you will support our proposed budget as we go through the fire together! With Deep Appreciation, David Utro @Recognized-Delegates @rune   image615\u00d71558 92.6 KB  ",

Llama Delegate Platform    Calendars have a high likelihood of being picked up by GovAlpha(GOV). Call Support will fall on the shoulders of GOV (and maybe SES?) and may be degraded for the beginning of 2023. No more call summaries for public calls & one less competent host. Forum will have two fewer moderators to fix and tidy things up, though I think it could handle it. Govalpha have been the primary mods, while we mostly fix tags and categorizations. Reddit will likely lose a moderator (50% chance they move to being compensated by GOV) Emergency Comms support won\u2019t suffer much\u2013a lot of the documentation is 85% done and probably makes more sense to be handled within GOV anyway. Stakeholder alignment will likely end in its current state, though I think a good template for how it could be done was set. Others can run similar calls if they feel it\u2019s needed. Collateral Management is changing so I don\u2019t think the CM call is going to carry on in its current form (TBD) and same goes for Security as IS-001 has a high likelihood of being offboarded and generally speaking it\u2019s just been GOV/COM/TECH/IS at those meetings. The SEC milestones we set are valuable and I hope GOV won\u2019t let them get dropped. Stakeholder Content; Weekly Relay, Forum at a Glance, and the Aggregated CU Updates thread likely won\u2019t get picked up right away, if at all. I don\u2019t know what the future of stakeholder content would look like. Stakeholder Database will stop being updated, though we intended to give it over to SES to integrate it into the Ecosystem Dashboard they are developing. Afterall we did the legwork for the GDPR compliance and have a good foundation of data. Stakeholder Notices; I imagine have a high likelihood of being picked up by GOV. Trackers; Some may be picked up, others will become obsolete. I imagine if anyone picks them up it would be GOV. Additionally, for current events tracking, we started doing short research papers to sum things up as a point of reference. That work would likely stop.    @Recognized-Delegates ",

Regarding your budget specifically, I (Puncar) appreciate that you have tried to put the cost down, I still think that some of the activities in current market conditions might be rather nice to have, and I would not support the overall budget. But as a team, we decided to abstain as we think, similar to what you said; considering the endgame timeline, we don\u2019t want to cause any more disruption. ",
