Wilmington Savings and Fund Society, FSB (\u201cWSFS\u201d) will act as trustee.     Executive Summary This risk assessment is intended to evaluate the risks and opportunities of the Huntingdon Valley Bank (HVB) MIP-6 proposal. The subject proposal is for a loan participation facility with a 100MM DAI debt ceiling. The relationship between HVB and RWA Master Participation Trust (established for the benefit of MakerDAO) will not be one of a borrower and a lender. Instead, HVB will have access to DAI liquidity in exchange for the sale of participation interests in the underlying whole loans originated by HVB. HVB will be required to retain at least 50% of each whole loan, while the Trust will retain a maximum of 50% of each whole loan. As the yield due to the Trust is a function of the underlying assets (participations), this figure is likely to change every month. Primary risks are concentration risk (in HVB), direct credit exposure to the underlying participated loans without an additional layer of HVB credit enhancement, scaling risk, development risk, regulatory risk, recession risk, and consumer loans. These risks are mitigated by HVB\u2019s conservative underwriting practices, HVB\u2019s substantial skin in the game via its continued exposure to no less than 50% of the participated loan, minimal penalty for underutilization of Trust funding, HVB\u2019s strong existing relationship with regulators, HVB\u2019s preference for loans secured by anti-cyclical collateral, the power of Confessions of Judgements in PA law, and conservative guardrails such as minimum FICO/debt-to-income ratio for underwriting consumer loans. Primary opportunities are wholesale lending, scale, alignment, symbiosis, and a turn-key solution. This deal provides Maker and HVBank the opportunity to sculpt, from the ground-up, a rigorous off-chain structure to both protect Maker\u2019s interests, provide Maker with access to real world assets at scale, and create a new and deep pool of liquidity for HVB. Doing things the \u201cold-fashioned\u201d way is a small price to pay for the upside: if approved, this deal will represent the first large-scale partnership between a regulated US bank and a Defi Protocol. RWF holds that the HVB opportunity maintains good risk-adjusted return on a scalable framework that adds to the diversity and resilience of collateral backing the peg.  Risks vs. Opportunities  Primary Risks:   Concentration Risk: The proposed vault will have a debt ceiling of $100MM. This will represent the largest RWA vault to date and 5th largest MakerDAO vault currently outstanding. This vault will represent a large, concentrated exposure to HV Bancorp, Huntingdon Valley Bank, and asset values in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.  Credit Risk: While a pari passu structure does align the interests of Maker and HVB, it does not provide Maker with credit enhancement, exposing Maker directly to losses on the underlying loan portfolio, As such Maker is dependent on consistent, high quality credit underwriting by HVB.  Servicing Risk: given that Maker shares a first loss position, the protocol depends on consistent, high quality loan servicing by HVB.  Scaling Risk: Though HVB has been extending credit since inception in 1871, it has done so at a conservative pace. Sober underwriting is generally a good thing. With that said, the $100M facility will expand its lending capacity and could require HVB to scale up its deployment resources.  Development Risk: The proposed vault is backed, to some extent, by loans for the construction of commercial and residential properties. Within real estate credit, construction loans are some of the riskiest loans. These assets are exposed to the creditworthiness and competence of the developer, the competence of the contractor, the possibility of cost inflation (materials, labor, etc.), the possibility of delays, and the always-present possibility that the market turns. MakerDAO\u2019s vault will ultimately be collateralized by the underlying properties. It is much more difficult to liquidate or sell on the open market a partially completed construction project than it is a stabilized, cash-flowing commercial asset.  Regulatory Risk: Forging a partnership with an established, regulated entity represents both an opportunity and a risk to MakerDAO.  Recession Risk/Consumer Loans: The likelihood of the US economy entering a recession (two quarters of negative GDP growth) by the end of Q2 is fairly high. As financial conditions tighten and worry sets in, we would expect to see a few consequences. First, companies will begin tightening their belts by cutting personnel. Second, rising rates will push up borrowing rates for auto loans, mortgages, and credit cards, eroding the consumer balance sheet. As the average consumer\u2019s earning power relative to his or her debt increases, HVB must exercise even more discretion in underwriting lest it take on overleveraged clients.  Mitigants: These risks are mitigated by a diverse portfolio across multiple asset classes, conservative underwriting practices at the asset and portfolio levels, substantial skin in the game from HVB (50%), minimal penalty for underutilization of Trust funding, HVB\u2019s employment of a life-long contractor as a construction loan officer, regulated oversight from the Federal Reserve/Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities/FDIC/SEC, strong existing relationship with those regulators, preference for loans secured by anti-cyclical collateral, frequent recourse to borrower\u2019s personal assets, the power of Confessions of Judgements in PA law, and conservative guardrails such as minimum FICO/debt-to-income ratio for underwriting consumer loans. Primary Opportunities   Wholesale Lending: In this transaction, MakerDAO is underwriting a lender as opposed to the underlying assets. By scrutinizing managers as opposed to assets, MakerDAO benefits from infrastructural leverage\u2026i.e. build a commercial/legal/technical structure once, underwrite the underwriter, and drip additional funding to them as the vault seasons and the underwriter performs.  Scale: The proposal represents the opportunity to onboard $100MM of real world assets over 12-18 months. Should the community be satisfied with the performance of the initial vault, the opportunity exists to scale up exposure to HVB accordingly.  Symbiosis: Huntingdon Valley Bank is a publicly traded state-chartered commercial bank established in 1871 and regulated by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, PA Department of Banking, and the SEC. MakerDAO is the oldest and most robust DeFi protocol. HVB attains flexibility and savviness by plugging into DeFi via MakerDAO. MakerDAO gains legitimacy, a diversification of collateral, and a measured, established hand in the real world by participating in HVB assets. If approved, a participation agreement between a protocol and US bank would forge a new chapter of history and send a powerful signal to institutional counterparties of what is to come.  Deep Alignment: Because MakerDAO is participating pari passu with HVB, a natural financial alignment exists between the two parties. HVB will have large exposure alongside MakerDAO. This incentivizes HVB to originate judiciously and to act quickly and effectively to resolve bad debt and drive recoveries when special servicing MakerDAO\u2019s loans to end-borrowers.  Turn-Key Solution: HVB will provide an out-of-the-box yield solution for MakerDAO. On Maker\u2019s behalf, HVB will originate assets, retain half of the risk of those assets, master service those assets, and special service those assets. MakerDAO can, through this arrangement, diversify its capital markets approach by leaning on a specialist with expertise in production, maintenance, and recovery of real world yield. Finally, because the Trust is built to be multi-bank, other counter-parties can be included without re-implementing the entire process.

HVB - Originator/Sponsor Profile Profile: Huntingdon Valley Bank (\u201cHVB\u201d) is a Pennsylvania Chartered American commercial bank owned by the publicly-held holding company HV Bancorp. Inc. (NASDAQ Listed: HVBC), subject to regulatory oversight from the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (Investor Relations and Public Filings). The bank was established in 1871. Essence: HVB has long been an active lender in the mid-Atlantic with a focus on the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and New York markets. Since inception, it has focused primarily on the origination of commercial and residential mortgages. On the commercial side, HVB originates fixed and floating rate mortgages on stabilized, cash-flowing properties as well as floating rate mortgages on commercial construction projects. HVB also originates revolving credit facilities to private non-bank lenders (wholesale lending), non-real estate commercial & industrial loans (C&I), asset-based and e-commerce collateralized loans, consumer loans, and capital call lines. Motivation: Huntingdon Valley Bank, a Pennsylvania-based community bank, is seeking a 100MM DAI DC participation facility to support growth of existing business and to grow new businesses. As a community bank, HVB is experienced in bank-to-bank participation agreements, which are used with some regularity to support borrowers with individual or aggregate lending needs in excess of the bank\u2019s internal or legal lending limits. Sharing debt exposures with MakerDAO would enable HVB, a regulated entity, to grow into its seasoned clients without breaching single-borrower ceilings and continue this existing participation practice with a dedicated entity. Further, this facility would enable HVB to grow new business significantly. The bank intends to leverage the facility to continue originating familiar assets like stabilized and construction mortgages, lender finance, commercial & industrial (C&I) loans, government guaranteed or affiliated loans, capital call lines, personal loans, and residential mortgages. It will also enable the bank to branch into newer verticals and follow markets as they evolve.

Special Servicing is part of the Loan Operations department at HVB. Originator: Historical Production During FY 2021, HVB originated $142.5MM in new loans. For the quarters 2Q21, 3Q21, and 4Q21, HVBank\u2019s Commercial Lending Division originated new commercial loan production of $42.4M, $27.6M, and $49.6M, respectively. Of the total production in 2021, $55.6MM was attributable to amortizing stabilized commercial mortgages, $63.9MM was attributable to construction loans, and $11.2MM was attributable to non-real estate commercial & industrial (C&I) loans. The remaining 2021 production can be attributed to revolving credit facilities to small lenders, or wholesale lending, ($8MM) and syndicated loans ($4MM). The graph below demonstrates the production by loan type across the portfolio as well as those opportunities that exist in the current pipeline.  1600\u00d71159 103 KB  Within the 2021 commercial loan production, the gross interest yield on all non-construction loans averaged about 4.50%, gross interest yield on construction loans averaged about 5.0%, and the total weighted average gross interest yield averaged about 4.65%. Credit Policy HVB is subject to a credit policy that is reviewed and approved by the Board and Regulators and adhered to by all lenders. This policy is cross-checked by the underwriting team. As a standard methodology across the banking industry, this policy has certain parameters, some internal (e.g. fully reserved DSCRs of 1.25x) and some supervisory (e.g. FIRREA laws surrounding appraisals and LTVs). However, some of these constraints and thresholds are subject to change as per specific characteristics of borrowers, market conditions, etc. To account for inconsistency, HVB also uses a Risk Rating System which rolls up a variety of loan-specific characteristics into an \u201call-in\u201d risk profile. This mechanism ensures a level of consistency in underwriting, both across market conditions and across asset classes. As readers will notice, an internal risk rating of \u201c6\u201d is necessary for HVB to originate a loan, whether under the proposed participation facility or independent of it. Financial Standing For the year ended 2021, HVBank as a whole reported $210,000 of loan losses (losses incurred on one outstanding loan) on total average assets at FYE of $554.4 million (average loans of $313.8 million) and total outstanding loans at FYE of $376.5 million, for a credit loss rate of around 0.06%. Total average assets includes treasury securities, cash, investments, deposits at other banks, loans held for sale (residential mortgages), and outstanding loans (loans receivable) net of allowance for loan losses. At the end of Q1 2022, the bank had $556.5MM in total assets and $515.1MM in total liabilities on the balance sheet. These assets included $323.8MM in loans receivable, $121.1MM in cash and cash equivalents and $71.6MM in investment securities. Liabilities include $466MM in deposits and $26.5MM in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank.  1578\u00d71280 586 KB  Net interest income (after provision for loan losses) for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $3.52MM compared to the figure for the three months ended March 31, 2021 of $3.12MM. Total non-interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $3.14MM compared to the figure for the three months ended March 31, 2021 of $4.10MM. Total non-interest expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2022 were $5.93MM compared to the figure for the three months ended March 31, 2021 of $5.43MM. These figures result in a net income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 of $601,000 compared to a figure for the three months ended March 31, 2021 of $1.3MM. This translates to net income per share for the three months ended March 31, 2022 of $0.29 compared to a figure for the three months ended March 31, 2021 of $0.65. Comprehensive (Loss) income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was ($1.193MM) compared to a figure for the three months ended March 31, 2022 of $1.07MM. This difference is due to a ($1.79MM) unrealized loss on available for sale securities.  1582\u00d71216 463 KB  Summary: HVB\u2019s 3/31/2022 performance is down compared to the same time period last year. This is primarily due to decreasing volumes in the residential mortgage market\u2014roughly 50% lower than the prior period. Q1 tends to be slower and an environment of rising rates puts further downward pressure on activity. Management reports that Q2 performance was more in line with prior periods.

When HVB proposes loans for participation, Ankura Trust, the calculation agent, will ensure that proposed loan participations are eligible for funding in accordance with the loan criteria set forth in the Master Participation Agreement. Ankura Trust is retained as an agent of the Trust and provides an independent review of each proposed loan participation. If participations conform, the Trust will acquire a (maximum) 50% interest in the underlying loan by executing a Certificate of Participation in exchange for cash. The Trustee, WSFS, will custody these Certificates of Participation. The Trustee will not require any further instructions prior to the acquisition of the loan participations if Ankura Trust confirms that the loan participations satisfy the eligibility requirements. On a monthly basis, HVB shall remit to the Trust the appropriate pro-rata portion of all amounts received by HVB in respect of the loan participations. The Trust Agreement instructs the Trustee, upon receipt of such amounts, to make payments in accordance with the cash waterfall defined in the Trust Agreement. See Diagram #6 below. Master Participation Agreement Terms Summary: The terms contemplated below come directly from the term sheet that has been aligned on by HVB and the Real World Finance Core Unit (and reflecting the MIP6). Purpose: The relationship between HVB and the Trust will not be one of a borrower and a lender. The Trust will purchase loan participations from HVB. Debt Ceiling: 100MM DAI Alignment: HVB will retain at least a 50% exposure to the underlying whole loans. The Trust shall hold a maximum of 50% of the participations, meaning HVB will always maintain at least as much exposure to underlying loans as Maker. Maker and HVB participate in asset on level footing, or on a pari passu basis\u2014meaning no one is junior or senior to anyone else. The 50/50 split marks a change with regard to the initial MIP-6 application, which contemplated a 5% risk retention for \u201csyndications\u201d from financial institutions external to HVB\u2014a certain improvement. Sale or Assignment of Participation Interests: HVB reserves the right to repurchase any and all of the participation interests from the Trust at a present value of the future contractual payments associated with the participation interests (including in respect of the interest payment on floating rate loans) based on a discount rate equal to (A) the US Treasury rate with a term closest to the remaining term of the repurchased loans for fixed rate loans plus the effective spread at origination between the gross interest yield and the like-term US Treasury rate at the time and (B) the par value for floating rate loans (collectively known as the \u201cPresent Value\u201d) with thirty (30) days\u2019 notice, with the Present Value rate set at the conclusion of the same business day as the notice. HVB\u2019s repurchase right shall be the whole (not part) of such participation interest. If the Trust seeks to sell or transfer any interest in all or any portion of its participation interests HVB reserves the right of first refusal to acquire said participation interests in full at the Present Value prior to a sale to any third party. Reporting: HVB shall provide the Trust with monthly anonymized accounting (or more frequently if so determined by HVB) of advances to the Borrowers, repayments of principal, payments of interest and all fees, delinquency/special servicing status and loan balances (\u201cSettlement Report\u201d). HVB shall provide the Settlement Report together with the monthly remittance. Servicing: HVB shall retain exclusive rights as the Servicer of the loans. Servicing Fees: The Servicing Fees will be calculated in arrears on the outstanding balance of the participation interest of each individual participated loan purchased by the Trust for the preceding reporting period (actual number of days outstanding) and equal to (A) one and one-quarter of one percent (1.25%) per annum on the first $10,000,000 of the participation interest of each participated loan purchased by the Trust (the \u201cBase Loan Balance\u201d) and (B) three quarters of one percent (0.75%) per annum on any amounts greater than the Base Loan Balance of the participation interest of each participated loan. Eligibility Approval Process: Each Participated Loan presented to the Trust for purchase shall follow the following process. a) HVB shall have internally approved the loan. b) HVB will prepare a Certificate of Participation for the proposed loan to be purchased and provide a signed copy to the Trust. c) HVB will provide Ankura Trust (as Calculation Agent) with a view- or read-only access to a secured online data room folder which will contain a copy of the HVB underwriting memo, related materials, and associated loan documents (\u201cEligibility Package\u201d). d) Ankura Trust will independently review the Eligibility Package according to the Loan Participation Eligibility Requirements and respond with a purchase decision within five (5) business days of being notified of the Eligibility Package. If approved, the Trust shall counter-sign the Certificate of Participation, along with any supplemental transaction information. Diagram #3: Approving & Funding a Participation  1600\u00d7892 165 KB  Pre-Funding or Required Minimum Liquidity: To ensure that the Trust has adequate funding to purchase eligible participations (up to the $100M commitment), the Trust shall either: a) Receive up-front funding of the full $100 million into an account in the name of the Trust; or; b) Maintain at all times sufficient liquid assets consisting of cash, money market, or similar accounts, in an amount sufficient to cover 125% of the aggregate committed balances of the Trust\u2019s Participated Interest in the outstanding Participated Loans, including the unused amounts under lines of credit, revolvers, and other facilities not fully drawn at the time of issuance, up to the $100M. This shall include the committed principal balance of Participated Loans that have met the eligibility approval process discussed herein but have not yet been purchased. Because the Trust is not a bank or other financial institution with the mandate and resources to raise funds traditionally, this requirement is crucial to HVB being able to meet contractually obligated commitments under the Participated Loans. All funds, whether held by the Trust in accounts directed by the Trust to an acceptable financial institution or at HVB, shall be maintained in authorized investments or accounts that are generally accepted for municipal deposits (e.g. PA 1971 Act 72) thereby ensuring the maintenance of principal balance of those funds. \u201cAuthorized investments\u201d shall mean an exchange traded fund composed of United States treasury securities with a term of three (3) months or less managed by a fund manager(s) acceptable to the trustees, or similar acceptable product offered by the trustee. Insolvency of HVB: In the event HVB becomes insolvent or the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, is subjected to the appointment of any person to take charge of HVB or HVB\u2019s assets, has HVB\u2019s interest in a Participated Loan involuntarily sold or is in breach of HVB\u2019s obligations under the Master Participation Agreement or the Certificate of Participation , the Trust shall have the option on notice to HVB to assume all of the powers granted to HVB in the Master Participation Agreement and to designate any person or firm, in its discretion, to exercise such powers. In such event, the loan documents and records relative to the Participated Loan will be delivered promptly to the Trust or its designee, as the case may be, together with such other documentation as the Trust may reasonably request. In the event there are other participants as to a Participated Loan which have similar rights as the Trustee, the participant with the then largest participating interest will have the option contemplated in this paragraph; provided, that if such participant shall not exercise such option, the remaining participants will have a right to exercise such option based upon the failure of each participant with a greater participation interest to exercise the option after notice from the subject participant requesting either an election of the option to assume HVB\u2019s powers or a release of the option. Termination of Purchases: The Trust may terminate future purchases under the Master Participation Agreement with ninety (90) days prior written notice. If either party exercises its right of termination, the Master Participation Agreement shall remain effective and the parties bound until the indefeasible payment in full of the last outstanding Participated Loan referenced in a Certificate of Participation. Facility Characteristics Stability Fee/Yield Dynamics: Because the yield payable to the Trust is a direct function of the amount due and payable from the underlying assets (participations), this figure may vary from month to month depending on each underlying loan. In order to best map this reality onto the mechanics of MakerDAO vaults, the stability fee will be set to 0%. As contemplated, the distributions due to MakerDAO are equivalent to the all-in yield of the \u201cTrust\u201d. All-in means net of (1) taxes, (2) trustee fees, (2) paying agent & verification agent fees, (3) servicing fees, (4) calculation agent and crypto servicer fees, RWA Trust governance fees and exchange agent fees. Minimum net yield for floating rate assets: 1-Month SOFR* + 75 bps, at the time of eligibility determination. For example, if HVB is originating a 1-year government guaranteed business loan, the interest rate will, at a minimum be, 1.47% + .75% = 2.22% *SOFR is replacing LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate for floating debt instruments Minimum net yield for fixed rate assets: Like-term US Treasury* + 30 bps, at the time of eligibility determination. For example, if HVB is originating a 5-year fixed commercial mortgage, the interest rate will, at a minimum, be 3.50% + .30% = 3.80%. *The US Treasury yield for a given term, or \u201cT\u201d, is used as a benchmark rate for fixed debt instruments Expected net yield for floating rate assets: 1-month SOFR + 145-195 bps. Today: 1.47% + 1.45%-1.95% = 2.92%-3.42%. Expected net yield for fixed rate assets: Like term US Treasury + 145-195 bps. Net yield is defined as yield owed to the Trust net of servicing fees payable to HVB. Minimum yield is NOT net of calculation agent, trustee, or fiat-crypto exchange fees. Please refer to the section titled \u201cVault Dynamics\u201d for further detail. Expected Fixed/Floating Rate Composition: HVB is expected to originate roughly a 50/50 mix of floating and fixed rate participations. This ratio will depend on the asset types in the ultimate portfolio, interest rates, preferences of HVB\u2019s clientele, and market conditions. Expected Facility Volume: $100MM in originations over 12-18 months. HVB expects to deploy the $100MM in total capacity over the course of 12-18 months. Depending on HVB\u2019s performance and any outside capital it manages to raise over the interim, HVB may ask Maker to consider an upsize in a few years. Skin in the Game: HVB will retain at least as much if not more exposure to the underlying loans as MakerDAO. This structure will ensure that HVB acts in Maker\u2019s best interests which are its own best interests. Recourse: Recourse refers to a lender\u2019s right to seek restitution in a borrower\u2019s personal assets, or assets that were not pledged as part of the security interest on a loan. HVB rarely originates non-recourse loans. This means that, should a borrower default, HVB almost always has the right to seek recovery through foreclosure of the loan security but also through the borrower\u2019s personal assets. Recourse here is further enhanced by the strength of Confessions of Judgment. Loan-to-Value: Maximum of approximately 80%. This is calculated by combining the maximum LTV on real estate loans with the maximum LTV on non-RE business loans. See Asset Eligibility Criteria for more detail. Off-Chain Liquidation Process: If a portfolio loan defaults and becomes non-performing, it transitions into \u201cSpecial Servicing\u201d, or workout. HVB, as the Servicer, may elect to A) restructure the payment terms with the borrower B) foreclose on the underlying collateral, either hold/operate or auction the asset or C) liquidate the non-performing loan (NPL). HVB will have broad discretion to manage servicing of non-performing loans without the involvement of the Trust. HVB and the Trust\u2019s interests are generally aligned. The liquidation process for a real estate loan will of course be different than that of a Commercial & Industrial (C&I) Loan which will be different than that of a consumer loan. In general, in the case such loans erode, HVB might look towards specialized NPL funds for liquidity. HVB might also enlist a broker who specializes in the sale of such loans. Alternatively, HVB may also opportunistically liquidate performing portfolio loans. If, for example, rates reverse tack and begin declining, HVBs (and thus Maker\u2019s) fixed rate positions would appreciate accordingly. It may thus make sense to test the sales market for these assets. The liquidation process for performing loans is similar to that of NPLs but easier\u2014a deeper bench of buyers, more liquidity, lower transaction costs etc. On-Chain Liquidation Process: MIP-21. The technical implementation will be captured in detail in the technical risk assessment, prepared by @collateral-core-unit. Order of Operations: How Does the Structure Flow? Diagram #4:  Initial Funding of Structure illustrates how Maker will initially fund the entire 100M DAI which will be converted into $100M by the Exchange Broker before being deposited in the Participation Funding Account maintained by the Trust.  This accomplishes two objectives:  one, this upfront funding will significantly reduce HVB\u2019s exposure to Maker funding risk.  Two, it will enable Maker to earn yield on the unused cash balances that are invested in high quality, short term instruments. To be clear, funds on deposit in the Participation Funding Account will only be released to HVB in connection with the purchase of a loan participation. Diagram #4: Initial Funding of Structure  1600\u00d7897 161 KB  Diagram #5: Monthly Flow of Funds  1600\u00d7876 163 KB  The Diagram #5: Monthly Flow of Funds above details the order of operations for this proposed participation facility.   Receipt of P+I: Borrowers pay principal and interest to the servicer, HVB   Reconciliation:   HVB produces and sends a servicing report to the \u201cCrypto Servicer\u201d and remits P+I to a \u201cParticipation Receipt Account\u201d at WSFS, the Trustee & Paying Agent   WSFS produces and sends a Trust Report to the Crypto Servicer which reconciles all fees paid out by the Trustee for tax and to various service providers   Genesis, the crypto/fiat broker, produces and sends to the Crypto Servicer a trading report, which reconciles DAI/FIAT conversion.   Consolidated MakerDAO Remittance: The Crypto Servicer, consolidates these three reports into one comprehensive remittance report. This report will, for the benefit of Maker token holders, tie-out the cash flows for this deal on a monthly basis to the last penny.   Waterfall Payments: WSFS executes the waterfall of payments as per the Trust Agreement. The below diagram outlines the waterfall instructions.   Diagram #6: Cash Waterfall  1600\u00d7873 150 KB  Because the proposed structure is one of participation in a variety of underlying loans, MakerDAO\u2019s yield will correspond exactly to the yield of those loans less any taxes, fees, costs and expenses incurred in maintaining the overall structure, such as servicing, trustee fees, paying agent fees, calculation agent fees, and exchange agent fees (Cash Waterfall). This structure is different from that of existing MakerDAO vaults, where a revolving credit facility with a fixed stability fee is underwritten to a lender (e.g. New Silver or 6S Capital). HVB will originate, into the Trust, loans with both fixed and floating interest rates. So, the \u201cstability fee\u201d to MakerDAO will consist of both fixed and floating rate components. Because the interest rates that both fixed and floating loans are priced off of fluctuate (Like-term US Treasury rate and SOFR, respectively) the DAI  earned from the assets in which MakerDAO participates will fluctuate. For this reason, the vault will not receive a consistent stability fee, whether fixed or floating (spread above a known benchmark). The stability fee will thus be set to zero to simplify accounting at Maker. Net interest paid on participations will be converted to DAI and passed directly to the Maker Surplus Buffer on a monthly basis. Principal repayments on participations are returned to a \u201cParticipation Funding Account\u201d to fund new originations. If interest is insufficient to pay items 1, 2, 3, 4, and/or 5 above, principal will be diverted to pay-out the waterfall balance. Taxes and service providers must be paid, lest the structure cease to function. The Trustee will have standing instructions to invest \u201cidle\u201d cash on deposit in the accounts in \u201cAuthorized Investments\u201d \u2192 to be defined as \u201can exchange traded fund or money market fund composed of United States treasury securities with a term of three (3) months or less\u201d. Twice a year, the Trustee will sweep all proceeds from the \u201cAuthorized Investment Income Account\u201d for eventual deposit into Maker\u2019s Surplus Buffer. Diagram #7: Authorized Investments  1600\u00d7875 171 KB  Thanks to @eumenes and @christiancdpetersen, this proposed structure provides Maker with rights and protections in line with standard structured finance deals. Token holders further benefit from an embedded yield-bearing treasury strategy which mobilizes idle cash. This dynamic meshes nicely with existing initiatives being explored for the monetization of Maker\u2019s treasury assets. RWF and the incubating LTS will work with the Trustee, Genesis Trading and RWA Foundation to embed payment flows into the actual terms of the Trust Agreement, Exchange Agreement and the RWA Foundation organizational documents and then restrict the parties ability to amend or modify those terms without the consent of Maker DAO governance. The intention is to establish \u201cbelts and braces\u201d protections in respect of the payment flows from the Trust back to the Maker Surplus Buffer. Asset Mix - Description & Overview Commercial Real Estate Loans (Stabilized, Construction, Lender Finance) Broadly, Commercial Real Estate (CRE) refers to Real Estate that is used for investment/business rather than consumption. Property types include retail, office, industrial, hospitality, residential, and mixed-use. Residential real estate is generally considered to be of commercial variety if it has in excess of 4 units and is NOT owner-occupied. HVB originates three types of CRE loans, all of which are secured by liens on the underlying real property:    Stabilized loans     Construction loans     Revolver to lenders of the first two loan types    A stabilized loan is secured by a property that is cash-flowing. Whether a distribution warehouse or a residential apartment building, the property will be occupied by rent-paying tenant(s). The loan is typically sized based on the earning capacity or rental income of the asset vis a vis the monthly debt service (debt service coverage ratio or debt yield, DSCR/DY). A construction loan is secured by a property that is not yet cash-flowing. The construction loan is meant to bridge the developer\u2019s property from unimproved to tenanted and cash-flowing. Construction loans, unlike stabilized loans, require the sponsors to make \u201cdraws\u201d according to the needs of the project, as opposed to receiving access to 100% of the proceeds up front. The loan is sized based on A) the appraised value of the un-tenanted, raw property (\u201cdark value\u201d) and B) future expected earning capacity or rental income of the asset vis a vis the monthly debt service (expected DSCR/DY). Lender Finance will typically entail a revolver, or a secured facility that lenders can draw on to finance their originations. So, smaller lenders who originate stabilized and construction mortgages will use HVB\u2019s facility to finance those assets. Commercial & Industrial Loans C&I is a broad category of loans that encapsulates lines of credit and term loans to businesses. Such loans are typically secured against the collateral or cash flows of the borrowing entity. These loans are typically shorter-term (1-3 years) and tend to be priced off of floating indices (LIBOR/SOFR). C&I loans are primarily used to finance working capital and capital expenditures (CapEx). In addition to working capital loans (inventory, A/R, etc.), HVBs C&I business might originate equipment or other fixed asset financing, ABL financing, wholesale revolvers, real estate-secured business loans, leveraged buyouts, and SBA loans. Government Guaranteed or Affiliated Loans Government entities will guarantee loans that are strategic for the strength of the economy. This backstop provides lenders the safety to originate such loans with a de facto exposure to US government credit. Programs such as USDA, Main Street (if revived), and IDA/EDC loans would be defined as part of this category. Such loans tend to be floating rate and lower-yielding. Consumer Loans These are general-purpose personal loans to borrowers. Such products are underwritten against credit metrics such as credit scores and debt-to-income ratios. These products are typically unsecured, priced off a floating rate index, and shorter-term (1-3 years). Residential Real Estate Loans These are mortgages secured by residential real estate. Residential real estate can be broadly classified as property that is inhabited by the borrower, although properties with 1-4 residential units technically qualify as well. Capital Call Lines Also known as Subscription Finance Facilities, Capital Call Lines are revolving credit lines that a lender provides to a private equity fund. As the name suggests, such facilities are secured against the uncalled capital commitments of the fund\u2019s limited partners. A Capital Call Line is typically used by a fund\u2019s managers to bridge investments or for other temporary funding (working capital) needs. Because capital calls on a fund\u2019s limited partners are discrete, a capital call line can help the fund \u201csmooth out\u201d the calls. HVB\u2019s capital call lines will benefit from an exclusive pledge over investors\u2019 capital commitments, the fund\u2019s bank accounts, and the GP\u2019s right to call and enforce capital commitments. The bank further retains the right to step in as a limited partner should default occur. In his fifteen years of underwriting private equity funds, HVB\u2019s Capital Call Head has never had a credit loss. Risks by Collateral Type   Commercial Real Estate (CRE)  Construction  Development/execution risk Input cost over-run  Materials: supply chain delays/inflation Wages: tight labor market/union labor     Capitalization Rate Expansion  Rising interest rates putting downward pressure on valuations   Changing Work/Life Cadence  High risk in Class B office, especially suburban Secular risk in retail      Lender Finance  Borrower is overleveraged, over-concentrated, or has no distinct edge/focus in the marketplace; generalist Similar risks to CRE   Government Guaranteed or Affiliated Loans  Commercial and Industrial Loans  Recession Business sector-specific weaknesses    Consumer loans  Consumer debt to income ratio rises with rates Recession\u2014unemployment rate grows [As rates rise] borrowers may elect to pay down secured indebtedness before unsecured consumer    Residential Real Estate  Rising mortgage rates putting downward pressure on valuations Consumer balance sheets eroding    Capital Call Lines  Drawdown in asset values: LPs may default on capital call commitments in the case that the portfolios that compose their Net Worth/Liquidity profiles decrease in value. In such a scenario, LPs may be required to post margin elsewhere and thus renege on LP obligations to the private equity fund.    Construction Mitigant: Construction loans are a key product for HVB\u2014because the asset demands rigorous due diligence, it has made the appropriate upgrades to the underwriting apparatus. In an industry-leading move, HVB has hired and trained a seasoned contractor to monitor all draws, review all budgets, serve as an independent reviewer, and provide a level of expert oversight to the process. The correlation between construction loan losses and opacity into the construction process is high. As such, HVB expects its underwriting enhancements to be a bank standard going forward. Eligibility Criteria Portfolio Loan Criteria (\u201cMaster Participation Agreement\u201d) The eligibility criteria for assets will be outlined in the Master Participation Agreement. The Calculation Agent, Ankura Trust Company, will independently compare proposed loan participations to the conditions detailed in the Master Participation Agreement and either approve or reject. See the below for a summary of the eligibility criteria. Preliminary general conditions to be eligible for participation:  Loan is currently in good standing with the Bank Loan was made according to the Bank\u2019s approved Credit and Loan Policies Properly collateralized and secured (if collateralized) Satisfactory cash flow coverage of loan payments (for new construction, satisfactory payment plan during construction and satisfactory pro forma cash flow based on underwriting of the subject property and market fundamentals following completion) For loans that include a fixed rate period, said fixed rate period shall not exceed five (5) years No events of default No loans to insiders or other Reg O  All loans meet standard compliance measures, searches, etc.  \u201cPortfolio Loan\u201d can be reasonably categorized as one of: (1) Senior Secured Amortizing Stabilized Commercial Mortgage (2) Senior Secured Amortizing Construction Commercial Mortgage (3) Senior secured asset-backed term loan or revolving credit line to a lender of (1) or (2) (4) Senior Secured Non-Real Estate Commercial & Industrial Loan (5) Government guaranteed or affiliated loans (6) Capital Call Line (7) Consumer loan Eligibility Criteria by Asset Type Preliminary conditions relative to certain loan types:   Commercial Construction and Investment Real Estate Secured Loans:      Internal Risk Rating PASS or better (6 or better)     Loan Type Amortizing commercial mortgage   Credit Score(s) Principals Minimum of 680; no bankruptcy within last 10 years   LTV (Loan to Value) Maximum LTV of 75%; appraised value determined by an independent appraiser and reviewed by a third party appraisal management firm to confirm property value and compliance with all FIRREA regulations   Debt Service Coverage Minimum of 1.20x, as consistently measured by Bank\u2019s credit policy   Covenants Compliance with all financial and affirmative covenants   Default No current, ongoing, or unresolved event of default, as defined by the loan documentation   Good standing Account considered to be in good standing at the financial institution     Non Investment Real Estate Business Loan      Internal Risk Rating PASS or better (6 or better)     Loan Type(s) Amortizing commercial mortgage (owner occupied)   Credit Score(s) Principals Minimum of 680; no bankruptcy within last 10 years   LTV Maximum LTV of 80%; appraised value determined by an independent appraiser and reviewed by a third party appraisal management firm to confirm property value and compliance with all FIRREA regulations   Debt Service Coverage Minimum of 1.20x, as consistently measured by Bank\u2019s credit policy   Covenants Compliance with all financial and affirmative covenants   Default No current, ongoing, or unresolved event of default, as defined by the loan documentation   Good standing Account considered to be in good standing at the financial institution     All Other Loans Made in the Ordinary Course of Business      Internal Risk Rating PASS or better (6 or better)     Loan Type(s) Amortizing term loan; revolving line of credit   Credit Score(s) Principals Minimum of 680; no bankruptcy within last 10 years   LTV and Advance Rates Properly collateralized (if secured) based on acceptable advance rates as determined by the Bank\u2019s credit policy; proper periodic reporting of advance rates and borrowing base reports if required   Debt Service Coverage Minimum of 1.20x, as consistently measured by Bank\u2019s credit policy   Covenants Compliance with all financial and affirmative covenants   Default No current, ongoing, or unresolved event of default, as defined by the loan documentation   Good standing Account considered to be in good standing at the financial institution    Concentration Limits Geography     Concentration Criteria Maximum Percent of Debt Ceiling Actual Percent of Debt Ceiling Actual Balances     Construction Loans 40% X% $0   Investment Real Estate 40% X% $0   Business Loans 50% X% $0   Industry Concentrations 25% by NAICS X% by NAICS $0   Individual Borrower or Loan 14% by Borrower or Loan X% $0   Consumer Loans 15% X% $0   Residential Mortgages 20% X% $0   Geographic Concentrations See below* X% by state $ per state    *HVB shall only sell, and the Trust shall only purchase, Participated Loans originated in the United States of America; concentration will be reported on a State by State basis. Governance, Decision-Making and Control Governance, decision-making and control occurs at different stages and times in the HVB transaction lifecycle. The defining principles for governance, decision-making and control are to delegate key actions and decisions to independent, third parties, enhance trustlessness and mitigate potential losses.     Subject Delegation     Management of moneys paid to the Trust by HVB from loan participations The Trust Agreement will specifically require WSFS (as paying agent) to apply monies in accordance with a predefined cash waterfall that outlines payment priorities. The cash waterfall cannot be amended without Maker approval.   Management of moneys paid from Trust to Maker Surplus and/or Maker Vault The Trust Agreement will specifically require WSFS (as paying agent) to distribute monies at the bottom of the cash waterfall to the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agreement will specifically require, pursuant to a standing instruction, that WSFS (as escrow agent) distribute monies to a designated account with the Exchange Broker. Preferred Option #1 RWF and the incubating LTS will seek to include a provision in the agreement with the Escrow Agent and the Exchange Broker that the Escrow Agent and Exchange Broker may only send monies received from the Trust to designated accounts as follows: (1) by Escrow Agent, to a designated account with the Exchange Broker, and (2) by the Exchange Broker, to (A) an address for the surplus buffer (interest/income), and (B) an address for the Maker vault (principal). RWF and the incubating LTS will seek to include a provision in the agreement with the Escrow Agent and the Exchange Broker that neither can amend the above without Maker approval. Preferred Option #2 If the Escrow Agent and the Exchange Broker cannot commit to Preferred Option #1, RWF and the incubating LTS will seek a written acknowledgement from the Escrow Agent and the Exchange Broker that any funds received from the Trust are for the benefit of the surplus buffer address and the Maker vault address and that the Escrow Agent and the Exchange Broker will not accept any other address unless approved by Maker. Option #3 If the Escrow Agent and the Exchange Broker cannot agree to either Preferred Option #1 or Preferred Option #2, RWF and the incubating LTS will propose an \u201cirrevocable written instruction\u201d supplemented by a limitation in the RWA Foundation Articles of Association that neither the Director, the Supervisor, the Secretary or any member of the Delegated Committee may alter the instruction unless approved by Maker.   Loan Eligibility Ankura Trust, as calculation agent, will provide an independent, third party review to confirm if a loan meets the eligibility requirements.   Maker \u201cSacred Rights\u201d Maker approval will be required for, at a minimum, the following matters: HVB Transaction Level (i) Increases or decreases the Commitment (ii) A reduction of Debt Ceiling to zero (iii) Termination of the Master Participation Agreement or any Transaction Document to which it is a party (iv) An amendment to a Certificate of Participation (v) An amendment to the Trust Agreement, the Loan Servicing Agreement, the Calculation Agent Agreement, the Collateral Custodial Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (other than clarifying amendments to manifest errors which may be approved by the Trust Sponsor); (vi) Changes or removes the Trust Sponsor (vii) Changes the Beneficiaries of the Trust (viii) Expands the powers of the Trust Sponsor (ix) Changes the situs of the Trust (x) Permits the Trust to purchase loan participations in an aggregate principal amount which exceeds the Debt Ceiling (xi) Changes the role of the Calculation Agent. RWA Foundation Level (i) Amendment to the agreement with the Exchange Broker (ii) Amendment to the Escrow Agreement (iii) Amendment to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of RWA Foundation   Delegated Committee Such other matters from time to time brought to the Delegated Committee and which do not constitute Maker \u201csacred rights\u201d.    Maker/Delegated Committee Decisioning Delegated Committee: persons nominated by MakerDAO tokenholders to interact with RWA Foundation (as Trust Sponsor) and indirectly the Trustee on behalf of MakerDAO in respect to matters relating to the transaction. RWA Foundation, as Trust Sponsor, may require, from time to time, guidance on particular courses of action or have a point of communication for the overall management of the transaction. To facilitate communication with the sole director and/or supervisor of RWA Foundation, as may be required from time to time, Maker token holders, in approval of the proposed transaction, will authorize certain individuals to act as a \u201cDelegated Committee\u201d. The RWF Core Unit and the incubating LTS are endeavoring to identify potential delegates. The RWF Core Unit and the incubating LTS will update this Risk Assessment with the proposed Delegated Committee in advance of a Governance Vote. The Delegated Committee shall ensure that it makes available on forum.makerdao.com all communications received from, or sent to, RWA Foundation. Each person serving as a committee member will have a term of one year from the 1st anniversary of the Instruction. The Maker token holders may extend or terminate their respective terms (individually or collectively) at the one year anniversary. Maker token holders may, from time to time and at any time, in their sole discretion add, remove and/or replace the persons appointed to the Delegated Committee via a Governance Poll. The Maker token holders instruct the members of the Delegated Committee to act on a consensus basis and, if the Delegated Committee is unable to reach a consensus, the Delegated Committee shall request guidance from the Maker token holders via a posting at forum.makerdao.com. The Delegate Committee shall not decide on any of the Maker \u201csacred rights\u201d (as described above) without the approval of Maker token holders pursuant to a vote in accordance with the MakerDAO protocol. The Maker token holders may expand or contract the authorities of the Delegated Committee from time to time (including expanding the Maker \u201csacred rights\u201d). All decisions of the Maker token holders shall be pursuant to a Governance Poll in accordance with the rules of the MakerDAO protocol. The Delegated Committee may, from time to time, consult with one or more of the applicable subject matter experts within the Maker DAO community on matters relating to the transaction (including any applicable core units or successors to the same). On a monthly basis, the Delegated Committee shall report to the Maker community, via the Forum, of any developments from time to time in respect of the transaction. The form and substance of such reports to be determined by the Delegated Committee with the support of the Real World Finance Core Unit and the Maker token holders. The existing RWA Foundation Articles of Association will be amended prior to funding. RWA Foundation #001 - RWA Foundation The amendments will constrain the ability of the sole director to take certain actions without either the instruction of the Delegated Committee (if populated by a vote of the Maker token holders) or the affirmative vote of Maker token holders. For instance, as a belts and braces approach, RWA Foundation\u2019s sole director will not have authority to cause RWA Foundation (as Trust Sponsor) to take action in respect of any Maker \u201csacred rights\u201d at the level of the Trust without the affirmative vote of the Maker token holders. Further, the amendments to the Articles of Association will limit the ability of the sole director to amend the Escrow Agreement with WSFS, amend the Exchange Agreement with Genesis, or amend the Articles of Association themselves in each case, without the Maker token holders affirmative vote. This will ensure that no person has the ability to modify the overall transaction structure and cash flows from the Trust to Maker. If the sole director does take an action contrary to the Articles of Association, such action will be ultra vires and will likely subject the director to liability.  Expected Credit Loss  HVB Internal Expected Losses HVB, at least quarterly, reviews the entire portfolio by asset class to determine the anticipated loss ratios. Historically, this figure has averaged about 1%. This is a charge (added to \u201cLoan Loss Reserve\u201d, equivalent to Maker\u2019s surplus buffer) which is a contra-asset account that offsets the loan portfolio assets. The Loan Loss Reserve is reduced by actual losses, which the bank tries to keep at or below 55 bps. This target can be supported by historical loss rates. Such ratios are publicly available and tracked by equity research analysts who cover Financials and bank verticals. RWF Independent Expected Loss Analysis As a basis for RWF\u2019s expected losses, we pulled commercial bank charge-off data from the St. Louis Fed and Federal Reserve and delinquency data from Morningstar (for construction loans). Due to the increased scrutiny on and tighter underwriting standards demanded of regulated banks (of which HVB is one) since the Great Financial Crisis, particularly with regard to mortgage lending, we did not feel that the 2008-2011 period was an appropriate stress test for the proposed transaction. Instead, we\u2019ve incorporated the relative underperformance of 2012-2013, the GFC hangover years, and 2020-2022, the COVID era, in our analysis. Accordingly, we utilized the average charge-off rate of the prior ten years (2012-2022) to generate expected annual loss rates per asset type for which Fed data was available. **The expected loss rates for all but Construction Commercial Mortgages, Consumer Loans, Capital Call Lines, and Government Guaranteed or Affiliated Loans were gauged this way. ** Construction Commercial Mortgages: Due to the inclusion of construction loans as part of broader commercial real estate categories on both the St. Louis Fed and Federal Reserve sites, an expected loss rate specific to construction loans originated by commercial banks could not be isolated. Accordingly, we used the instance of the highest annual charge-off rate over the ten-year period and, due to the riskiness of the asset class (See: Development Risk in Risk vs Opportunities above), added a 1.25% stress. Q2 2012 \u2013 0.79% + 1.25% = 2.04%. Consumer Loans: Due to the recession/consumer loans risk detailed in the Risk vs. Opportunities section of this risk assessment, we felt it appropriate to apply a 3% stress to the average annual charge-off rate for Credit Cards over the ten-year period. Average annual Credit Card charge-offs: 3.26%. 3.26% + 3.0% =** 6.26%**. Capital Call Lines: Capital Call Lines were not broken out specifically in any of these sources. We used an estimated annual loss of 1%, which is very conservative as per our conversations with credit professionals in the industry. Government Guaranteed or Affiliated Loans: Such products are typically either guaranteed or insured by the federal government, inheriting de facto US Government credit risk. Due to this structural enhancement, such loans are much safer than typical business or C&I loans. Accordingly, we used the instance of the lowest annual charge-off rate for Business Loans over the ten-year period: Q1 2022 \u2014 0.11%. See below for the expected annualized loss analysis broken out by asset class: RWF Expected Annual Loss By Asset Class  1600\u00d791 74.3 KB  RWF Expected Weighted Annual Loss: Commercial Real Estate Heavy  1600\u00d7158 130 KB  RWF Expected Weighted Annual Loss: Business Loan Heavy  1600\u00d7158 129 KB  Summary: RWF projects between a .84% and .90% annual loss rate, depending on HVB\u2019s ultimate asset mix.  Implementation Details Implementation details will be outlined in the Technical Assessment as published by @collateral-core-unit. This collateral onboarding will utilize a MIP-21 liquidation module and dummy token.  RWA Foundation Operational Cost Estimates The annual operational costs for RWA Foundation (subject to periodic adjustments) are estimated to be (based on 2022 figures):     Description Amount     Corporate director $10,000 per annum   Supervisor $13,000 per annum   Secretary $6,000 per annum   \u201cLease\u201d (typically required as a place of business and required for KYC purposes) $250 per month / $3,000 per annum    RWF is currently investigating options for RWA Foundation to engage an independent third party accounting firm. Any fees, costs and expenses for RWA Foundation will be paid from the cash waterfall.

This document, which outlines the agreement between HVB (the seller) and the Trust (the purchaser) will serve as the \u201chash\u201d of the agreement between parties. This hash is a formal requirement of the risk parameters that I\u2019ve just appended to the top of the Risk assessment Summary of Terms and Conditions May 25, 2022 Below are the terms and conditions for a commercial, legal and contractual structure to give effect to a Master Participation Agreement (\u201cMaster Participation Agreement\u201d) between Huntingdon Valley Bank, a Pennsylvania chartered bank (\u201cHVB\u201d or \u201cSeller\u201d) and RWA Master Participation Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (\u201cTrust\u201d or \u201cPurchaser\u201d) (and collectively the \u201cParties\u201d), for the sale by Seller, and the purchase by Purchaser, of loans that meet the Participated Loan Eligibility Criteria, pursuant to a Certificate of Participation (each such loan, a \u201cParticipated Loan\u201d). This letter is a continuation of the Maker Improvement Proposal 6 (\u201cMIP6\u201d) application submitted by RWA Company, LLC (\u201cRWA\u201d) on behalf of HVB to the MakerDAO (\u201cMaker\u201d) forum on March 25, 2022 and greenlit by the community on May 2, 2022. Seller: \tHuntingdon Valley Bank, a Pennsylvania Chartered Bank, wholly owned by HV Bancorp. Inc. (\u201cHVB\u201d) Purchaser: \tRWA Master Participation Trust, or a similarly acceptable newly formed Delaware statutory trust for the benefit of RWA Foundation, a Cayman Islands foundation company and, if acceptable to the Trustee, the holders of Maker tokens and the holders of DAI (the \u201cTrust\u201d) Master Participation Agreement Commitment of the Purchaser: \tOne hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) (the \u201cCommitment\u201d). Transaction: \tThe Trust shall acquire portions of individual loans originated or syndicated by HVB (the \u201cParticipated Loans\u201d). The Participated Loans shall be acquired according to the terms of a Master Participation Agreement and a Certificate of Participation, with eligibility for purchase terms discussed herein (Addendum 1). Participated Loans: \tThose certain loans originated by HVB in its ordinary course of business to approved borrowers (each a \u201cBorrower\u201d) that shall be evidenced by a loan agreement, note, security documents, guarantees, and all other documents as may be modified, renewed, extended, replaced, restated or substituted, from time to time (the \u201cLoan Documents\u201d). HVB Percentage: \tHVB shall hold a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the Participated Loans (\u201cHVB Percentage\u201d). Trust Percentage: \tThe Trust shall hold a maximum of fifty percent (50%) of the Participated Loans (\u201cTrust Percentage\u201d). Participation Interest: \tThe Trust\u2019s participation interest in the Participated Loans, including all principal, interest, unused committed line or facility fees (but not origination fees) and all other amounts for which Borrower may from time to time be liable to HVB under its Loan Documents and related materials (\u201cParticipation Interest\u201d). Furthermore, the Participation Interest shall represent an undivided ownership interest in each Participated Loan, including an equivalent interest in, with respect to such Participated Loan, the loan documents, the collateral and all security in that collateral (\u201cCollateral\u201d), collections, and any and all continuing guarantees made by any and all parties, persons or entities guaranteeing payment of any and all obligations of borrower. The Participation Interest shall in no way be construed as an extension of credit by the Trust, as purchaser, to HVB, as seller. Sale or Assignment of Participation Interests: \tTrust represents and agrees that it is acquiring its Participation Interests for its own account for investment and with no present intention of distributing or reselling all or any part thereof. Trust agrees that it will not sell or transfer any interest in all or any portion of its Participation Interest without HVB\u2019s express and prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. HVB reserves the right to repurchase any and all of the Participated Interests from the Trust at a present value of the future contractual payments associated with the Participated Interests (including in respect of the interest payment on floating rate loans) based on a discount rate equal to (A) the US Treasury rate with a term closest to the remaining term of the repurchased loans for fixed rate loans plus the effective spread at origination between the gross interest yield and the like-term US Treasury rate at the time and (B) the par value for floating rate loans (collectively known as the \u201cPresent Value\u201d) with thirty (30) days\u2019 notice, with the Present Value rate set at the conclusion of the same business day as the notice. HVB\u2019s repurchase right in respect of a Participated Interest shall be the whole (not part) of such Participated Interest. If the Trust seeks to sell or transfer any interest in all or any portion of its Participation Interests HVB reserve the right of first refusal to acquire said Participation Interests in full at the Present Value prior to a sale to any third party. Trust acknowledges that the purchase of Participated Interests shall pertain solely to those specific Participated Loans and not to any other credit facilities or other obligations of any other HVB loan or any other Borrower and/or guarantor to HVB besides the specific Participated Loan. Trust Customer Due Diligence: \tThe Trust shall represent to HVB that it has followed all federal customer due diligence regulations, known colloquially as know your customer (KYC), as part of a comprehensive and required anti-money laundering programs regarding funds received by the Trust. Subject to the trustee\u2019s customary practice, the trustee\u2019s internal counsel may provide a confirmation of the same. Transaction Agreements and Participation Documents: \tThe Master Participation shall be documented by, including but not limited to, a Master Participation Agreement, a Certificate of Participation, and any supplemental information (the \u201cParticipation Documents\u201d). Additional documents related to the transaction shall include Loan Servicing Agreement, Broker-Dealer Agreement, Trust Agreement, and such other documents as may be required from time to time and determined by the Parties and their counsel. Certificate of Participation: \tEach Participated Loan shall include a certificate of participation that will identify, among others to be agreed upon in the definitive documentation, the following: a)\tName of the underlying Borrower; b)\tThe total committed principal amount of the Participated Loan from HVB to Borrower (the \u201cObligations\u201d); c)\tThe proposed Participation Percentage and the amount of the Participated Loan to be Participated to the Trust; d)\tThe term of the Participated Loan; e)\tThe interest rate of the Participated Loan; f)\tUnused committed line or facility fees; g)\tFunding mechanics; h)\tSuch other information related to the Eligibility Criteria; i)\tAny other terms and conditions agreed from time to time.

Reporting:\tHVB shall provide the Trust with monthly anonymized accounting (or more frequently if so determined by HVB) of advances to the Borrowers, repayments of principal, payments of interest and all fees, and loan balances (\u201cSettlement Report\u201d). HVB shall provide the Settlement Report together with the monthly remittance under \u201cLoan Servicing\u201d. The Settlement Report rendered to Trust shall be deemed correct and binding unless Trust notifies HVB by certified mail, return receipt requested to the contrary within thirty (30) days after the date when the Settlement Report is mailed or otherwise delivered to such Trust, and specifying the objection to the Settlement Report. The Settlement Report shall be part of Loan Servicing so long as HVB is the Servicer. If for any reason HVB no longer services the Participated Loans, HVB will continue to provide the Settlement Report to the Trust on all Participated Loans. Loan Servicing: \tHVB shall be the exclusive servicer for the Participated Loans as documented by a Loan Servicing Agreement between HVB and the Trust for the servicing of Participated Loans.

Servicing Fees: \tHVB shall charge fees for the Servicing of the Participated Loans for the Trust (the \u201cServicing Fees\u201d). The Servicing Fees will be calculated in arrears on the outstanding balance of the Participation Interest of each individual Participated Loan purchased by the Trust for the preceding reporting period (actual number of days outstanding) and equal to (A) one and one-quarter of one percent (1.25%) per annum on the first $10,000,000 of the Participation Interest of each Participated Loan purchased by the Trust (the \u201cBase Loan Balance\u201d) and (B) three quarters of one percent (0.75%) per annum on any amounts greater than the Base Loan Balance of the Participation Interest of each Participated Loan. The Trust shall pay the accrued Servicing Fees to the Servicer no later than ten (10) business days following the Remittance Date.

The Trust, or its agent, may at any time with at least thirty (30) days written notice, physically inspect all collateral files. Collateral Custodian Fees: \tFees for Collateral Custodianship are included in the Servicing Fee. HVB will not charge separate collateral custodian fees to the Trust. Trust Agent: \tTrust authorizes HVB to the fully extent provided to exercise all powers as are reasonably incidental for the receipt of all payments of principal, interest, fees, and expenses, with the full power and authority as agent. Eligibility Approval Process: \tEach Participated Loan presented to the Trust for purchase shall follow the following process: a)\tHVB shall have internally approved the loan. b)\tHVB will prepare a Certificate of Participation for the proposed loan to be purchased and provide a signed copy to the Trust. c)\tHVB will provide the Trust or its agent with a view- or read-only access to a secured online data room folder which will contain a copy of the HVB underwriting memo, related materials, and associated loan documents (\u201cEligibility Package\u201d). d)\tThe Trust or its agent will review the Eligibility Package according to the Loan Participation Eligibility Requirements and respond with a purchase decision within five (5) business days of being notified of the Eligibility Package. e)\tIf approved, the Trust shall counter-sign the Certificate of Participation, along with any supplemental transaction information. Loan Participation Eligibility Criteria:\tThe Trust shall receive and review an Eligibility Package from HVB to determine the eligibility of loans for participation (see \u201cAddendum 1 \u2013 Loan Participation Eligibility Criteria\u201d for general and specific loan type eligibility criteria). The Trust enters each participation following its own independent investigation of the Borrower, Loan Documents, and all parties who may be liable under the Loan Documents. Trust represents that it makes its own analysis of each Participated Loan and reserves the right to make inquires to HVB to the extent it feels necessary to meet the Eligibility Criteria. Timing of Participation Decision: \tThe Trust shall have five (5) business days from submission of an Eligibility Package to the Trust to make an eligibility determination in writing. Following approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Trust will sign the Certificate of Participation, and any supplemental information, and shall fund upon request according to the Funding Mechanics. Timing is of the essence in funding loans and all parties will work in good faith to quickly and accurately prepare and review the proposed Participated Loans Funding Mechanics:\tUpon approval of the purchase of a Participated Loan, the execution of a Certificate of Participation by both Parties, and following receipt of all required documents, then: a)\tThe Trust will advance its funds via Fedwire no later than 3 pm (New York) of the business day following the last to occur of execution of the Certificate of Participation or receipt of all required documents. b)\tIf the Certificate of Participation provides for multiple payments to HVB as a result of multiple disbursements to the underlying borrower for revolving, non-revolving, and multi-advance loans, the definitive documents shall provide a mechanism for funding indicating the amount of the advance and the required timing, no less than once a month during the term of each loan, net of Trust Percentage of collected principal, interest, and fees. If HVB shall be required for any reason to refund or repay to Borrower (or any successor or any other person), at any time all or any portion of any payment which was received by HVB, Trust shall simultaneously remit to HVB a sum equal to the Trust Percentage of the amount which was required to be so refunded or repaid. Pre-Funding or Required Minimum Liquidity: \tThe Trust shall have the option of: a)\tFunding the full amount of the Commitment into accounts consisting of cash, money market, or similar investments in the name of the Trust; or; b)\tMaintain at all times sufficient liquid assets consisting of cash, money market, or similar accounts, in an amount sufficient to cover 125% of the aggregate committed balances of the Trust\u2019s Participated Interest in the outstanding Participated Loans, including the unused amounts under lines of credit, revolvers, and other facilities not fully drawn at the time of issuance, up to the Commitment. This shall include the committed principal balance of Participated Loans that have met the eligibility approval process discussed herein but have not yet been purchased. Because the Trust is not a bank or other financial institution with the mandate and resources to raise funds traditionally, this requirement is crucial to HVB being able to meet contractually obligated commitments under the Participated Loans. All funds, whether held by the Trust in accounts directed by the Trust to an acceptable financial institution or at HVB, shall be maintained in authorized investments or accounts that are generally accepted for municipal deposits (e.g. PA 1971 Act 72) thereby ensuring the maintenance of principal balance of those funds. \u201cAuthorized investments\u201d shall mean an exchange traded fund comprised of United States treasury securities with a term of three (3) months or less managed by a fund manager(s) acceptable to the trustees, or similar acceptable product offered by the trustee. Loan Categories: \tAll loans originated or purchased by HVB in its ordinary course of business and that in all factors comply with the Bank\u2019s credit policy and loan origination guidelines shall be considered to be eligible for Participated Loans. Supervisory Limits:\tNo Loan Category shall be limited in any way that is more restrictive than the regulatory or supervisory limits that are required by the Bank\u2019s primary state and federal regulators. A quarterly concentration report (Addendum 2) shall be provided to the Trust detailing concentrations as reported to the Bank\u2019s primary regulators. Notice: \tHVB agrees to provide prompt written notice to Trust when HVB takes any of the following actions with respect to the Participated Loan: a)\tPaying any taxes, assessments, premiums or other charges which Borrower is obligated to pay pursuant to, or expend any sums to cure any default by Borrower under the Loan Documents; b)\tWaiving default interest as authorized or required by any Loan Document in excess of the non-default rate of interest; c)\tEntering into agreements with the Borrower with respect to the Participated Loan which are not in conflict with the express terms of the Master Participation Agreement, the Certificate of Participation or the Loan Documents; d)\tDeclaring an event of default under the Loan Documents (including without limitation based upon a \u201ccross-default\u201d with any other obligations owed by the Borrower or any guarantor to HVB, participant or any third party) or to accelerate the maturity date of the Participated Loan upon an event of default; e)\tCommencing any foreclosure or other action or proceeding of any nature on or with respect to the Participated Loan or the Loan Documents; and f)\tConsenting to junior liens or encumbrances or to any transfer of any interest in any Collateral, but nevertheless subject to the liens and security interests favoring HVB, with the perfected and priority status, all as contemplated by the Loan Documents Independence: \tNeither the execution and performance of the Master Participation Agreement and related documents, nor the ownership by the Trust of its Participation Interest, nor the sharing in the profits or losses arising from the transactions contemplated by the Master Participation Agreement, is intended to be, nor shall be construed to be, the formation of a partnership or joint venture between HVB and Trust or the subject Borrowers, or any of them. Representations and Warranties:\tHVB and the Trust, in respect of themselves only, shall make such representations and warranties (with appropriate qualifiers) as are customary for the sale and purchase of loan participations, including: a)\tOrganization, signatory power and authority; b)\tAuthorization, execution and delivery; c)\tEnforceability (subject to customary bankruptcy carve-outs); d)\tBeneficial ownership Standard of Care: \tHVB in performance of its duties and obligations under the Master Participation Agreement, shall only be obligated to exercise that degree of ordinary care as to the Participated Loan which it exercises in the conduct and management of loans for its own account. HVB shall in any event administer each Participated Loan in a commercially reasonable manner and in good faith for the benefit of HVB and the Trust. Insolvency of HVB: \tIn the event HVB becomes insolvent or the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, is subjected to the appointment of any person to take charge of HVB or HVB\u2019s assets, has HVB\u2019s interest in a Participated Loan involuntarily sold or is in breach of HVB\u2019s obligations under the Master Participation Agreement or the Certificate of Participation , the Trust shall have the option on notice to HVB to assume all of the powers granted to HVB the Master Participation Agreement and to designate any person or firm, in its discretion, to exercise such powers. In such event, the loan documents and records relative to the Participated Loan will be delivered promptly to the Trust or its designee, as the case may be, together with such other documentation as the Trust may reasonably request. In the event there are other participants as to a Participated Loan which have similar rights as the Trustee, the participant with the then largest participating interest will have the option contemplated in this paragraph; provided, that if such participant shall not exercise such option, the remaining participants will have a right to exercise such option based upon the failure of each participant with a greater participation interest to exercise the option after notice from the subject participant requesting either an election of the option to assume HVB\u2019s powers or a release of the option. Master Participation Event of Default: \tIn the event either party defaults under the Master Participation Agreement or a Certificate of Participation, and does not cure said default within thirty (30) days written notice of default, either party may exercise their rights and remedies under the Master Participation Agreement or any other agreement between HVB and the Trust or which are otherwise provided for at law or in equity. Termination of Purchases: \tThe Trust may terminate future purchases under the Master Participation Agreement with ninety (90) days prior written notice. If either party exercises its right of termination, the Master Participation Agreement shall remain effective and the parties bound until the indefeasible payment in full of the last outstanding Participated Loan referenced in a Certificate of Participation. Indemnification: \tTo the extent of the Participant Percentage, Trust hereby agrees to indemnify and hold HVB harmless from and against, and to contribute to HVB\u2019s Percentage of, any claim, loss, damage or liability incurred by HVB in connection with the Participated Loans, the related Loan Documents or the related Collateral and HVB\u2019s administration, servicing and monitoring thereof, including, without limitation, any claim or liability arising from HVB\u2019s acquisition of ownership or management of or control over any Collateral or any other property of Borrower; provided that Trust shall not be liable for any claim, loss or liability arising solely from HVB\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Limitation of Liability: \tExcept for a failure to act or perform in good faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct, neither HVB nor the Trust shall be liable for monetary damages to the other party for any action taken or omitted, or any error in judgment relating to the terms and provisions of the Master Participation Agreement, a Certificate of Participation, the collateral, the loan documents, or a loan. In no case shall either party be responsible for incidental, consequential, or punitive (exemplary) damages. Disputes and Governing: \tUnited States federal court for the Southern District of New York. Each of HVB and the Trust shall waive a trial by jury. The agreements shall be governed by New York Law. Application of Funds by Trust\tAs a precondition to HVB\u2019s execution of the Master Participation Agreement, HVB shall be satisfied, in its reasonable opinion, that the Trust Agreement sets forth a priority of payments, after receipt by the Trust of amounts from HVB as provided in \u201cLoan Servicing\u201d above, as follows: First, to any unpaid taxes due by the Trust; Second, to the payment of all unpaid fees, costs and expenses due to the Trustee or other persons under the Trust Agreement; Third, the unpaid Servicing Fees and such other amounts due to HVB; Fourth, to pay any unpaid amounts owed to the calculation agent under the calculation agent agreement; Fifth, to the Participation Funding Account, such amounts identified as return of principal and/or capital in the remittance report from the Servicer; and Thereafter, as set forth in the Trust Agreement. Addendum 1 \u2013 Loan Participation Eligibility Criteria: The following terms are offered as general and specific eligibility criteria for the review and acceptance of proposed Participated Loans. Minimum Yield: The Participated Loan shall be eligible for purchase if the interest yield at the time of approval of purchase meets the following thresholds:  For Floating Rate loans, the minimum interest rate less servicing fees shall be greater than or equal to 75 basis points in excess of the average one (1) month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; or For Fixed Rate loans, the minimum interest rate less servicing fees shall be greater than or equal to the like-term US Treasury rate plus 30 basis points.

                    "content": "    teej:  The proposal represents the opportunity to onboard $100MM of real world assets over 12-18 months. Should the community be satisfied with the performance of the initial vault, the opportunity exists to scale up exposure to HVB accordingly.   What are your estimates (or visualization) for the deployment of the the $100MM over the course of 12-18 months? In other words is there a breakdown per quarter? Ex. $20 in Q3, $65M in Q4, $10M in Q1, etc. I know the funds in the RWA MPT will incur interest via short-term treasuries, but wondering if HVB had provided an outlook with economic conditions being opaque.     teej:  HVB is expected to originate roughly a 50/50 mix of floating and fixed rate participations. This ratio will depend on the asset types in the ultimate portfolio, interest rates, preferences of HVB\u2019s clientele, and market conditions.   Is there anything in the Trust Agreement that allows MKR token owners to avoid participating in floating rate loans during turbulent RE market conditions? Or is that up to HVB to determine such?     teej:  frequent recourse to borrower\u2019s personal assets, the power of Confessions of Judgements  in PA law   This is good to know\u2014but only pertains to commercial properties\u2014do you know if this also pertains to loans made in other states such as NJ, etc. \u2014 apologies if the portfolio only pertains to PA.     teej:  HVB\u2019s 3/31/2022 performance is down compared to the same time period last year. This is primarily due to decreasing volumes in the residential mortgage market\u2014roughly 50% lower than the prior period. Q1 tends to be slower and an environment of rising rates puts further downward pressure on activity. Management reports that Q2 performance was more in line with prior periods.   Can you please provide comparisons to Q1 2020, Q1 2019, and Q1 2018 when rates started to rise. Thanks in advance     teej:  Genesis, the crypto/fiat broker, produces and sends to the Crypto Servicer a trading report, which reconciles DAI/FIAT conversion.   I was under the impression that the \u201ccrypto servicer\u201d will be Genesis - or are you referring to RWA & Co. as the Crypto Servicer?     teej:  If interest is insufficient to pay items 1, 2, 3, 4, and/or 5 above, principal will be diverted to pay-out the waterfall balance. Taxes and service providers must be paid, lest the structure cease to function.   If I understand this correctly, WSFS is paying taxes on behalf of RWA MPT? Can you please explain a little bit more.     teej:  RWF and the incubating LTS will work with the Trustee, Genesis Trading and RWA Foundation to embed payment flows into the actual terms of the Trust Agreement, Exchange Agreement and the RWA Foundation organizational documents and then restrict the parties ability to amend or modify those terms without the consent of Maker DAO governance. The intention is to establish \u201cbelts and braces\u201d protections in respect of the payment flows from the Trust back to the Maker Surplus Buffer.   On the CES report, it stated that RWF will need to perform a lot of monitoring of this loan\u2014can you please provide more color on how your team palms to tackle such and what it entails?     teej:  Broadly, Commercial Real Estate (CRE) refers to Real Estate that is used for investment/business rather than consumption. Property types include retail, office, industrial, hospitality, residential, and mixed-use. Residential real estate is generally considered to be of commercial variety if it has in excess of 4 units and is NOT owner-occupied.   Do you know if HVB will be providing loans to mix-use properties with Dry Cleaning, and/or laundromat services are involved. Interested in knowing \u2014 but if you don\u2019t have a visual into that \u2014 no worries.     teej:  A construction loan is secured by a property that is not yet cash-flowing. The construction loan is meant to bridge the developer\u2019s property from unimproved to tenanted and cash-flowing. Construction loans, unlike stabilized loans, require the sponsors to make \u201cdraws\u201d according to the needs of the project, as opposed to receiving access to 100% of the proceeds up front. The loan is sized based on A) the appraised value of the un-tenanted, raw property (\u201cdark value\u201d) and B) future expected earning capacity or rental income of the asset vis a vis the monthly debt service (expected DSCR/DY).   With regards to Construction loans. I was doing some small  researching and found an article stating that HVB in 2021 that incurred gross interest yield on all non-construction loans averaged about 4.50%. Gross interest yield on construction loans averaged about 5.0%. Do you know why gross yield on construction loans only increases by 50 basis points? I would think it would be north of 200++ but yea, interested in hearing your perspective. All in all this is one heck of an assessment that I will have to re-read. Thanks team! ",

I am definitely super supportive of this initiative and I see big potential in doing this right. A few questions:   How exactly does HVB plan to scale its sales to utilize the new funds? Are they going to decrease the risk parameters, increase marketing, expect higher demand due to maker conditions, tap into new markets, etc?   Are there any restrictions for MakerDAO to reuse this construct with other banks? (IP, non-compete, exclusivity rights, etc.)   Are there any success criteria for this relationship - means is there any threshold when we would consider scaling up or scaling down this initiative?

                    "content": "    flipflopflapdelegate:  What are your estimates (or visualization) for the deployment of the the $100MM over the course of 12-18 months? In other words is there a breakdown per quarter? Ex. $20 in Q3, $65M in Q4, $10M in Q1, etc. I know the funds in the RWA MPT will incur interest via short-term treasuries, but wondering if HVB had provided an outlook with economic conditions being opaque.   Guidance: $25-35MM will be put to work right away. The rest will be deployed as good risk-adjusted opportunities present themselves to HVB. The two \u201cexpected loss\u201d scenarios that we modeled should provide insight into potential asset class breakdowns. @HughMan @Daniel_Krewson can elaborate. [Adjustment: it seems Hugh already has]     flipflopflapdelegate:  Is there anything in the Trust Agreement that allows MKR token owners to avoid participating in floating rate loans during turbulent RE market conditions? Or is that up to HVB to determine such?   This structure is designed to be turn-key for MKR and flexible/accretive for HVB. HVB will always be better at navigating its backyard (geographically + asset class-wise) than MKR token holders. Thus it\u2019ll retain discretion in the types of loans it does and does not originate during different market conditions (within the eligibility criteria). Within the agreement is of course the ability to wind down the facility should MKR holders wish to go risk-off.     flipflopflapdelegate:  This is good to know\u2014but only pertains to commercial properties\u2014do you know if this also pertains to loans made in other states such as NJ, etc. \u2014 apologies if the portfolio only pertains to PA.   HVB typically makes all loans under PA state law. So the Confession of Judgement will be applicable for loans in and outside of PA. Again, HVB can elaborate on the mechanics.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Can you please provide comparisons to Q1 2020, Q1 2019, and Q1 2018 when rates started to rise. Thanks in advance   For clarity, you\u2019d like over-all asset performance from these periods or just resi mortgage performance?     flipflopflapdelegate:  I was under the impression that the \u201ccrypto servicer\u201d will be Genesis - or are you referring to RWA & Co. as the Crypto Servicer?   Ankura will serve as BOTH the calculation agent and the crypto servicer. The crypto servicer will collect and aggregate the remittance report (standard loan reporting on underlying portfolio provided by servicer, HVB), the Trust report (from WSFS), and the Trading report (from Genesis). It will then collate these docs into a single, comprehensive report that reconciles down to the last penny. This will be a first for RWA <> DeFi.     flipflopflapdelegate:  If I understand this correctly, WSFS is paying taxes on behalf of RWA MPT? Can you please explain a little bit more.   I will let @christiancdpetersen elaborate if needed. Annual taxes on real world income (interest + principal) will need to be paid. To the extent this expense is relevant, it of course must be addressed first. Taxes always retain primacy. As the Trust will owe it\u2019s pro-rata portion of taxes on the income coming off the underlying participations, WSFS will indeed pay them.     flipflopflapdelegate:  On the CES report, it stated that RWF will need to perform a lot of monitoring of this loan\u2014can you please provide more color on how your team palms to tackle such and what it entails?   There will of course be some monitoring required. However, this structure is deliberately designed to address what Maker IS and what it IS NOT. Because we do not intend to build out a bloated loan operations and credit underwriting department, the structure, alignment, and incentives, are engineered entirely around protecting our exposures. For example, HVB will act as servicer on the underlying loans and thus be responsible for monitoring for delinquencies/credit erosion and managing workout via their Special Servicing group. HVB is incentivized to perform as they own 50% of each whole loan. HVB is further obligated to report accurately on the portfolio (Master Servicer) and act in its fullest capacity to make recoveries (Special Servicer). Another example: Ankura was sought out deliberately because it will A) serve as a monitoring middleware B) Conduct \u201cspot-checks\u201d on the portfolio and C) are open to pushing data on-chain. Further, @williamr is very focused on data management, portfolio monitoring, and automation of data flows. As this will be our largest RWA exposure to date, I trust he\u2019ll put forth the gold standard for MKR token holders.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Do you know if HVB will be providing loans to mix-use properties with Dry Cleaning, and/or laundromat services are involved. Interested in knowing \u2014 but if you don\u2019t have a visual into that \u2014 no worries.   Easily the most fascinating question in the tome. Dry Cleaning businesses as well as Commercial Real Estate tenanted by Dry Cleaners are indeed eligible for financing. Go on and say your bit already\u2026! ",

It is communication, collaboration, and problem-solving that allowed us to execute in such a timeframe. (2) While we may have missed our original timeline of mid-June GANTT Schedule, we always knew the original timeline was aggressive. (3) I will prepare a separate posting that outlines some of the structural enhancements/innovations that we implemented in the HVB transaction to enhance transparency, give greater effect to decentralization, and ensure that Maker token holder interests are protected. Of course, there will always be areas for improvement. I will try to document them as well. (4) I will be posting the executed documents over the next day or so. I am exceptionally proud of the Core Units and our ability to onboard a high quality counter-party in a professional, timely manner. And many thanks to the HVB team and RWA Company for their support. We look forward to a successful relationship. @collateral-core-unit @Growth-Core-Unit @Protocol-Engineering @Oracles-Core-Unit @Real-World-Finance @Daniel_Krewson @HughMan @g_dip ",

So, as @teej notes, Maker and HVB are aligned in terms of economics and exposure. Third, while I acknowledge that origination fees may be an attractive source of revenue, nobody on RWF CU (or the other CUs) does anything to originate the loans. So, as a practical matter, what justification, other than the provision of capital, would Maker token holders have to ask for a portion of the origination fees? Finally, as I have been reminded multiple times by community members, the RWF CU does not have the authority to negotiate. Refer to point 1 above. ",

                    "content": "The minimum yield is simply the spread over the benchmark where the Trustee and Calculation Agent will refuse to purchase the loan from HVB. It\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll ever see this spread in my opinion, as it represents historically the lowest spread that we\u2019ve seen on these kind of loans, and the rate environment today is well within the bounds of historical adjustments. Low spreads like this generally only occur when there\u2019s a rapid and unexpected increase in policy rates coming from the Federal Reserve, as this causes a supply shock in terms of reducing the number of borrowers that can afford the new rate (among other variables). It does not necessarily proportionately impact the demand for the loans themselves from the financial sector, thus creating the mismatch and spread compression. Again, if HVB is originating a loan at 30bps over the benchmark, that is likely what the entire market is pricing those loans at and not just HVB. If they\u2019ve decided to underwrite the loan at that level of spread, it means that after a thorough analysis they still believe the risk/reward to be favorable. What you\u2019d likely see in a spread compression environment like this is that underwriting standards tighten significantly to compensate for the reduced margin of safety (which also contributes to the supply shock). So if HVB would have normally generated 10 loans of this nature at a 100bps spread, perhaps they would only generate 3 now because the other 7 are not creditworthy at the new rate. To summarize, this is why it\u2019s important to have a sophisticated and experienced underwriter with aligned incentives like HVB and its team. ",
