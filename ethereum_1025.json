                    "content": "TLDR; You\u2019d need to create a new EIP in Accepted to make a normative change to EIP-1 with this proposal. --- eip: 2458 title: Add updates and updated-by EIP Header Options for active EIPs author: Edson Ayllon (@edsonayllon)  discussions-to:  status: Draft type: Meta created: 2020-01-06 updates: 1 ---  Simple Summary Adds EIP header options  updates  and  updated-by  to frontmatter of  active  EIPs for use as needed. EIPs. Scope Adds header options. Changes process for updating active EIPs. Abstract EIP headers  updates  and  updated-by  are used for updating  active  EIPs. This is to make the improvement process of EIPs more modular, and have updates to existing  active  EIPs receive similar exposures to EIPs which replace existing  final  EIPs. Motivation Currently, EIP1 specifies EIP headers:  updated ,  replaces , and  superseded-by . Headers  replaces  and  superseded-by  indicates when an entire EIP is being replaced by another EIP, indicating when an EIP is now historical, and is updated by a new standard. The header  updated  indicates the date an EIP has received an update by EIP authors and editors, an example EIP being EIP1.  updated  is reserved for EIPs in  draft  or  active  status. In the case of  active  status, an EIP may receive an update, but these updates don\u2019t operate as with EIPs in  final  status, where a historical EIP is created, and the new EIP is referenced by the historical one. While these updates are not kept immutably, updates to active EIPs can be done modularly by creating a new EIP that goes through the standard discussion and auditing process EIPs undergo. The EIP headers  updates  and  updated-by  are to facilitate this modularity. Creating a new EIP also provides sufficient notification to affected stakeholders of an active EIP before that EIP is  updated . Specification updated-by updated-by  is reserved for EIPs in  active  status. For an EIP in status  active , updates to that EIP, which update the header  updated , should be started by opening a new EIP to start vetting for that update. When an  active  EIP receives a new entry to header  updated , an associated  updated-by  EIP listing should be included, where that newly listed EIP has reached  final  status, except where changes that don\u2019t change meaning, such as spelling and grammar corrections, are made. updates  should be included as an EIP header, as all EIP headers, and include a reference to an EIP designation. When multiple EIP designations are referenced, each should be separated by a comma. Example: --- updated-by: EIP9999, EIP9998 ---  updates updates  is reserved for EIPs updating EIPs in  active  status. An EIP listed as  updates  is implied to also be  requires ; only  updates  is needed for those EIP listings. Having an EIP listing  updates  does not necessarily mean that referenced EIP must reference back with an  updated-by  listing. updates  should be included as an EIP header, as all EIP headers, and include a reference to an EIP designation. When multiple EIP designations are referenced, each should be separated by a comma. Example: --- updates: EIP1 ---  Rationale updates  and  updated-by  apply only to EIPs in  active  status as updates to EIPs in  final  status are already handled by EIP headers  superseded-by  and  replaces . The syntax should align with previous EIP header syntax, as this EIP is not updating syntax, simply adding header options. Backwards Compatibility These EIP headers are optional and do not introduce compatibility issues. Implementation This EIP is an example implementation of  updates , updating EIP1.
