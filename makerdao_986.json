                    "content": "Adding to @MarianoDP\u2019s brand post I would like to share some thoughts.  TL;DR  Crypto market is still developing We don\u2019t have first mover advantage  It is in the tech first stage   We must re-build the Maker brand Crypto market is driven by tech savvy investors of a certain demographic To progress, the crypto market needs to overcome fear and lack of understanding  Jargons and new terminology are causing lack of understanding People don\u2019t trust because of lack of insurance   Whilst there\u2019s a lot of information out there about crypto not a lot is out there about defi Maker is the leader in owned Stablecoin lending but there is a huge lack of awareness around crypto borrowing and lending  We have to onboard entrepreneurs in the right markets within the growth audience and do this by owning the \u201cborrow crypto\u201d space.  We do this by  Creating lots of content Remove barriers from joining the ecosystem Create partnership Become socially responsible  Promote diversity Champion entrepreneurship Serve the underserved     To further develop and deliver on this strategy we need research, lots and lots of research Determine the role of channels and content Define measurement framework   A very important point Mariano made in his post,  We benefited from the first moving advantage in Defi, which helped us develop a reputation. However, our reputation has been fading over time, leaving room for the competition to take more space in the various media channels and leaving very limited visibility for MakerDao, although it is the oldest DAO in the whole crypto industry.  Building from this point, in 2005 Harvard Business School published The Combined Effects of Market and Technological Change, looking at how relationship between market and technology can impact first mover advantage.   Maker falls in the \u201cThe Technology Leads\u201d category. With this in mind, we must start by looking at what drives the larger Crypto market.  Context \u201cThe technology leads\u201d situation means we are still in the early market. If we layer on top the Diffusion of Innovation curve, it becomes quite clear where we are in our journey.  904\u00d7504 69.8 KB  Each of the five groups represent a unique psychographic profile i.e. a combination of psychological and demographic traits. Hence, marketing to these groups requires completely different strategies from those of other groups. By better understanding the differences among the groups, we can better target all these consumers with the right marcomms approach. So, what is stopping the bridge forming over the chasm? The Early Majority are pragmatists, they share some of the Early Adopters\u2019 ability to relate to technology. However, they are driven by a strong sense of practicality. They know that many inventions end up as passing fads. Consequently, they are content to wait and see how other customers are faring with the technology before investing in it themselves. They want to see well-established references before investing substantially. Because there are so many people in this segment (roughly 34%), winning these people over is fundamental for substantial growth. As such, Lack of understanding and fear is holding people from dipping their toes in decentralised finance.  Fear and greed index by Crypto Dashboard - Alternative.me measures current sentiment index as \u201cfear\u201d.   Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated1572\u00d7730 160 KB   In research of the UK population, 20% said \u201cit is too complicated to understand\u201d and 31% said \u201cit is too risky\u201d.   Chart, bar chart Description automatically generated1600\u00d7792 151 KB   31% or people in the US said they don\u2019t want to invest in cryptocurrency because of worries around hacking and fraud Close to $2.5bn were stolen from DeFi protocols in 2021  If the above is true as per the statistics, we must ask and answer 1. Why is there lack of understanding? Too many jargons, too technical, not knowing where to start? 2. What is the cause of the fear? Initial ICO fraud for those who tried, lack of insurance, no real example of success stories? Fear is driven by the unknown. If we look at crypto. com and coinbase as an example, even though coinbase has been around longer, crypto.com is taking up more market share. Crypto. com only recently began operating in the U.S. but already has volumes on par with Coinbase. The group has splashed out on a significant marketing campaign that has included Super Bowl ads and buying the naming rights for the L.A. Lakers\u2019 home stadium, previously the Staples Center and now the Crypto.com Arena. Quite clear that crypto.com is trying to reach more people by creating associations with known names out in the real world. Whilst the efforts by crypto.com is paying off to a degree, there are some obvious problems with their approach. If you head over to crypto.com homepage you will see a familiar face. What\u2019s interesting is if you read through the comments section on YouTube, it is filled with negative comments! It is quite easy to unpack an ad like this, get a likeable celebrity to speak with the masses. The obvious issue with this ad is, there isn\u2019t a clear message, the ad isn\u2019t targeted and is speaking to the mainstream market that isn\u2019t ready and won\u2019t be for a long time. This lack of focus in comms is dangerous. The comments suggest that this ad is causing the chasm to widen instead of being closed. So, who are the right people we need to reach out to and how do we speak to them?  Audience I have linked some more researches at the bottom that gives interesting stats on the current and the crypto-curious audience, but here\u2019s a snapshot of some key stats  86% of Americans know at least a little about crypto as of September 2021 The average crypto investor earns around $111,000 per year In the US the average age of current investors is 38 with 26% female and 74% male. 52% live in urban areas and 26% in small town and rural areas In the US the average of crypto-curious is 44 with 53% female and 47% male. 46% live in urban areas and 35% in small town and rural areas India is currently the biggest market by ownership for cryptocurrency, followed by the US The most common reason to invest in crypto is for long-term returns. Coinbase is the most popular trading app for cryptocurrencies among consumers, but Binance is more likely to attract institutional investors. In the UK cryptocurrency users had increased by 600% since 2018, when just 3% of the world\u2019s population owned Cryptocurrency  Nigeria has the biggest volume of Google search volume regarding \u201cCryptocurrency\u201d.   Strategic context Taking the above into consideration let\u2019s look at the DeFi space in the context of lending to understand the challenge and opportunity. DeFi pulse ranks Maker as the dominant lender in the market when it comes to owned stablecoin.  Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated1600\u00d7432 74.6 KB  Unfortunately, being the dominant leader doesn\u2019t mean guaranteed success if there isn\u2019t enough awareness of what Maker can offer people. A quick look at the number of Google results shows the lack of DeFi content. Number of sites on Google is a good indicator of how much interest there is in the market, close to 10bn pages about general cryptocurrency compared to 1m pages about cryptocurrency borrowing.  Chart, bar chart Description automatically generated1600\u00d7846 88.6 KB  The lack of information available is both a challenge and an opportunity for Maker. Through high quality content MakerDAO can own the \u201cborrow cryptocurrency\u201d space.  What is the Job to be done If I can be brave, I would say it Get tech savvy investors from investing in TradFi and early-stage crypto investment to seriously consider Maker as a long-term investment and start-up vehicle by removing fear and uncertainty through hand holding that will generate confidence To deliver on the GFTB, we can consider the below strategy as a though point.  Strategy Onboard entrepreneurs in the growth markets within the growth audience and do this by owning the \u201cborrow crypto\u201d space.  Tasks So, what are our tasks: as an example, if the job to be done is to clean the house, then tasks are to identify which areas need cleaning first, clean the floor, tidy up the bedroom, do the dishes etc. In our context, what are these? Off the top of my head,  research digging deep into the target audience and fully understand their traits create more educational content based on the audience\u2019s needs, attitude and motivation de-mystify DeFi terminologies by comparing to their traditional finance counterpart terminologies create an onboarding plan for the growth audiences, where should they start, who should they speak with create sense of belonging by have a voice in global issues that matter to people  Diversity and inclusion Represent the underrepresented Serve the underserved    AND DO ALL THESE WHILST NEVER FORGETTING THE ESSENCE OF A DAO. Going from here we need to focus on the research, lots of and lots of it. And develop an activation plan. This is a general framework which can be adapted for Maker\u2019s marcomms purposes. For anyone interested here\u2019s the workbook.  904\u00d7978 84.9 KB  These are just some starting thoughts and @MarianoDP\u2019s proposal to build a brand team shows the need for a clear strategy to succeed. The real challenge will be working out how we deliver on the marcomms promise that serves well not just the Maker brand, but rallies the community to embrace a different way of communicating with the market. Whilst the big focus for marcomms will be on bringing clarity and providing assurances, trust and sense of safety to those who will become Maker\u2019s end users, we need to create a strategy that runs in tangent which is internally focused (perhaps a topic for another post). It\u2019ll be great to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts. With that, quick thanks to @M_C @Retro @wouter and @Lenkla for the warm welcome to the MakerDAO community.
