Developer Incentives Our Developer Incentives has kicked-off  Dope Wars Retroactive & Development Incentives Program (RADIP) is a experimental program designed to encourage and reward contributions to the Dope Wars (DW) ecosystem. The program allows anyone to receive funding for their contributions to the project, which include anything from developing new features or fixing bugs, to creating games or for any Dope Improvement. RADIP is aligned with the Optimism Collectives ethos of Impact=Profit, a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of positive impact on the ecosystem. For DW this means that the success of the project is measured not only in terms of its financial profitability, but also by the positive impact it has on the community. RADIP is an innovative and forward-thinking program that demonstrates the potential of decentralized, community-driven projects. It allows people to contribute to the project in a way that aligns with DW values and motivations, and encourages collaboration and community involvement.
