The full list of final results & payout amounts can be found here. We would like to suggest voting on Snapshot to begin on Tuesday, July 5th in advance of payouts being made on Friday, July 15th.  Options to vote on:  Ratify the round results  You ratify the results as reported by the Public Goods Funding & Fraud Detection & Defense workstreams and request the keyholders of the community multisig to payout funds according to the GR14 final payout amounts through the non-custodial GR14 deployment contract.  Request further deliberation  You do not ratify the results and request key holders of the community multi-sig wallet to delay payment until further notice.  TLDR from the GR14 Post:   Grants Round 14 (GR14) ran from June 8-23, 2022   $4.9M will be distributed to public goods as part of the round, of which $3.2M came from the combined matching pools and $1.7M was contributed by the community.   Record-breaking community participation with over 44,000 contributors making just shy of 600,000 contributions to over 1,250 grants   GR14 featured 18 rounds:   The main round   14 Ecosystem rounds: Aurora, Celo, ENS, EthInfra, Lootverse, Mask, OpenGaming, Polygon, ProtocolLabs, Radicle, TheGraph, Unlock, ZKTech, Oakland   Three cause rounds: Climate Solutions, Advocacy and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)     In GR14, we continued on the same main pool structure as GR12 and GR13 \u2013 in GR12, the community chose to pilot a single pool approach with a 2.5% maximum cap for the main round rather than a category-based setup and we continued this through GR13 and GR14.   FDD\u2019s Governance Brief for an overview of sybil detection will be out soon, stay tuned.
