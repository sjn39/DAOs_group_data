Rather than try to shape the total delegate compensation process to fit my own needs and idiosyncratic involvement with Maker, I will instead try to return for one-time supplemental compensation when both I and the community feel I have delivered value to the DAO. Details I am requesting a one-time lump sum of 50,000 DAI outside of any delegate compensation that may or may not be forthcoming in the future. Payment should be made to the same address I use for SourceCred.   10,000 DAI earmarked to be the retainer for legal counsel. This is the amount quoted to me by several high-quality law firms, and I have a specific firm selected, if they will accept me as a client and still have no conflicting current clients.   20,000 DAI earmarked to purchase MKR on the open market within 7 days of receipt. Field Technologies, Inc (my company, and the owner of the delegation contract and through which I conduct all MakerDAO activities) holds less than 5 MKR. I hold no crypto assets outside of Field Technologies, Inc.   2500 DAI earmarked for taxes on the 20,000 DAI to purchase MKR. My effective tax rate is typically around 13%.   17,500 DAI as supplemental income to (partially) offset forgone income from less time spent as a cultural resources consultant (archaeology).   This is a proposed one-time, non-recurring payment. It is, however, my intention to return from time to time (perhaps annually or semi-annually) to see if the DAO believes my activities deserve additional compensation. This periodic revisiting of past performance also seems more appropriate than a forward-looking schedule, as I am neither an employee of the DAO nor guaranteed to maintain this position. It is not in lieu of any other form of compensation allocated by the DAO. Address for DAI: 0xBde950A3588C680fee26A7cFC7A34aE97EB45B8C Remarks I feel I have delivered value to Maker above and beyond what is reflected in my SourceCred, and have a clear path to continue to do so. Also, the first item is a fairly urgent need for me to continue to participate in this space. I have invested deeply in MakerDAO, and hope that MakerDAO can, in turn, modestly invest in me. Poll This poll will close in two weeks.    MakerDAO Should Make A One-Time Supplemental Payment To PaperImperium for 50,000 DAI?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     ",

This put the decision under a mandated actor which is probably in a better place to judge the interest of the work. This could fall under GovComm if this is related to discussing with Senators and doing some PR work. You can also create another GovComm CU or Lobbying CU if this is to be long term as you present it.  MIP55 is also a solution.  ",

                    "content": "I chose a signal request because I need to know income is or is not coming. Even a delegate compensation MIP will require 30 days of RFC before voting. The ambiguity about how much and timing of compensation means I cannot calibrate my own commitment of time and effort. Also, a signal request requires support from the community in a form where delegates enjoy no special advantage in the voting mechanism. Additionally, the lack of limited liability from the DAO means I have the potential for increased expenses \u2014 most notably I need legal advice on certain DAO matters, and I cannot pay for these out of my own pocket. Finally, there is an increasing opportunity cost to my level of activity within Maker. I firmly believe that Maker is a once in a lifetime enterprise that can become something very special. But a bird in hand is worth two in the bush, and I am increasingly asked \u201chow much to do what you do for Maker, but for our company/project\u201d? I know I am not the only delegate who has had to field questions about this \u2014 \u201cyou work for free for the whales?\u201d \u2014 in a DAO that is, quite frankly, known for its generous compensation schemes. But even without that, I have 3 kids. I have a business. I also have only 24 hours in a day. I need to scale my time commitment to Maker to match what compensation I believe will be coming. At the moment, I have no promise of anything other than SourceCred. I would prefer the opportunity to actively protect and expand Maker. But if that\u2019s not on the table, then I need to take a more passive approach \u2014 which means often saying no when DAO members want to discuss something, limiting any involvement beyond the forum, and a return to either my own business or another protocol. As to retroactive vs forward-looking: I think it would be inappropriate to have anything other than retroactive compensation for delegates. It provides some small speed bump against rent-seeking. Even the drafts for generic delegate compensation base it on past participation and past ability to attract MKR. While there are certainly ways to vest, those are more complicated and have not been proposed, much less voted into certainty. As to structure, a MIP allows a delegate like myself nearly cart blanche and seems inappropriate. With grants, we don\u2019t want delegates beholden to a CU whose budget they will need to vote upon.

A slightly tangential comment from me. Regardless of the outcome of this signal request, I am happy to see this distinction being made between work done in your capacity as a delegate and work done in your capacity as a community member. I think that was missing in several discussions before leading to very different expectations from the community on what a delegate needed to do and the corresponding compensation for that. I might also add that it is still a bit mixed up but I think this sort of thread starts to help separate the two. I think it\u2019s fair that you should be compensated and the only question that really remains is the structure through which you should be, whether it\u2019s ad-hoc signal requests or one of the existing methods as @SebVentures points out. I would also hope that this leads to a clear process by which anyone can contribute to whatever degree they like with both appropriate compensation and oversight. ",

PaperImperium:  I feel I have delivered value to Maker above and beyond what is reflected in my SourceCred   You should document it more precisely. Let me be more clear: you should not leverage your visibility (which is part of what being a delegate brings you) to automatically ask for money. It\u2019s important to leave a precise papertrail of what has been done. How much money. In one of your interviews (link) you said clearly that while some delegate compensation would be necessary, it should definitely not be at the same scale of CU Facilitators. 50k DAI for less than ~6 months (less? part-time?) work seems pretty high to me. Especially since you did not have to deliver anything concrete, no deadlines, no tasks, no supervision, etc. [that\u2019s the problem with a posteriori claims.]     SebVentures:  You can also create another GovComm CU or Lobbying CU if this is to be long term as you present it.   I totally agree that this would be a better path, since you are seemingly mixing your Delegate work with USA-Lobbying activity. We should be able to evaluate the two separately, and with concrete objectives/goals/milestones/etc. TL & DR: Everybody is aware of your high community participation and very enthusiastic delegate work.

To be quite frank, it may be aspirational that the legal fees will not consume more than the 10,000 DAI, but that is what is needed to get the ball rolling.

Re: @SebVentures, CU formation/CU grants/MIP55 are good but maybe a little too process-heavy and, trying to think long-term here, having a culture of quickly and easily deciding to give small-sized amounts for future OR past work will probably generate a lot of activity from outside contributors. They can all graduate to CUs or whatever later, but fast action on things that look promising yet uncertain will generate outsized returns. On that topic, I found this article on Tyler Cowen\u2019s fast funding strategy quite interesting. @iammeeoh I agree with most your message but I\u2019ll push back on \u201c50k is a lot\u201d. It\u2019s very important to stop thinking in terms of \u201cwhat is $50k to a person\u201d or \u201cwhat do people earn generally\u201d and more in terms of what Maker wants, what $50k represents for Maker, and what Maker would be purchasing for $50k here (in expectation). Governance may later decide that U.S. lobbying-related activities are a bad idea and should not continue but in the meantime the expected value of continuing this experiment is super high. Let\u2019s signal goodwill, grant $50k, and keep going with @PaperImperium. If you drop questions of process (although they do matter!) and the background question of delegate compensation, this is really a no-brainer. ",

                    "content": "A few points from someone who has been paid under grants as well as executive and sourcecred.  I have been here since 2019 and earned for EVERYTHING done no more than 20K DAI for work totaling on board 175hrs (BT report 40 under grant, BT compensation group 135 paid in a executive) + everything else.   I took a pretty long break from Maker simply because I had to be the one to \u2018kick the can\u2019 about no-one (including myself) in the BT compensation group being paid.  It was upsetting and put me off from Maker for a while. My intention is to compensate you @PaperImperium but I abstained because I have one problem with the justification for the amount.     PaperImperium:  20,000 DAI earmarked to purchase MKR on the open market within 7 days of receipt. Field Technologies, Inc (my company, and the owner of the delegation contract and through which I conduct all MakerDAO activities) holds less than 5 MKR. I hold no crypto assets outside of Field Technologies, Inc.   To give some perspective.   It was always my intention to take funds made from Maker and plow them back into voting fees and buying MKR as mostly a zero sum game.   In 2020 I wanted to take the money I felt I had earned from the last BT compensation payment (6750 btw which was 50/hr for billed 135hrs of work over a period of 4 months (chump change compared to what you are asking for Paper)  My work journal had a lot more hrs but I got some sourcecred too.   Frankly I am paid at 100/hr and have been for some time now.   One of the reasons I was upset was because I planned to buy about 12MKR for that 6750 which when I was finally paid became about 3-4 MKR because the price had already risen on me from about 500 to 3000\u2026  So 20K for you to buy more MKR.   Sorry if you get that then I would want to submit for the DAI to buy the remaining 8MKR I planned to get if I had been compensated in a timely manner (I actually boned up 12K to buy 4 more MKR at about 3K btw) to get to my whopping 7.8MKR at the time. Honestly I am doing work for CUs - did I ask for a grant.  No I am just going to submit the work when I get done and see if the CUs can find funds for some compensation.   Will they?  I am at the point I just assume they won\u2019t so this means everything is going to take 4-10 times longer because I don\u2019t have enough income to even drop to 1/2 time in my job so I can work 1 week on and take the other 1 week and work for Maker.  The rate also sucks.  50/hr compared to the 100/hr pretty much a huge leap down in compensation especially if one factors in SSI, taxes, lost retirement matches, vacation, medical (which I will have to pay for at 1/2 time) etc. So this is where we need a real distinction between delegate work as a delegate from something more formal like a CU.   Frankly paper I have considered nominating you for a head delegate position and wanting that position to be a paid CU that has responsibilities like interacting with other politicians, giving reports, etc.   100-150K/yr for this isn\u2019t unreasonable and the elected delegate to this and @PaperImperium is a great candidate deserving of it. My counter to your proposal for 50K DAI would be to support you for 30K and for you to consider creating a CU for delegates that is like a lead elected delegate - make a MIP for this.  I would support such a MIP and also support a CU budget for this office that also has authorities and responsibilities. When it comes to legal I keep thinking the organization should go for legal, but if everyone is a consultant I think everyone honestly is going to need their own legal or at least access to one.   I already have been burning my own cash talking to not one but two legal consults regarding my status as delegate, owner of MKR, and to get information that I can get no-where else from one of them.   I have not submitted a request for compensation for these lost funds or time. Loosely speaking this request is something that sets potentially a bad precedent.  But I have been around long enough to see the energy @PaperImperium has put forward - this for sure is worth 30K + earned SC.  The 20K DAI for Maker to make this 50K for as others have said < 6 months undefined or managed duty/responsibility seems a bit much.    But 100-150K/yr for a real approved delegate CU position under a MIP - NOT unreasonable. ",

Something modest is fair. I\u2019d definitely place the 50k proposed by @PaperImperium as reasonable and fair. W.r.t. to who is eligible for delegate compensation, the delegate should meet some minimum criteria.  Public / not-anon (sorry shadow delegates) [Otherwise, anyone can delegate themselves as a shadow delegate and receive compensation.] Some minimum threshold of MKR delegated (maybe >50mkr?)  There should be a cap to delegate compensation (50k seems fine\u2026 arguably higher is okay? but not by much). Maybe that cap is reached asymptotically as more MKR is delegated. Most importantly though, and maybe controversial\u2026 why should MKR foot the bill for this? Delegates with large MKR backing are presumably (apparently?) backed by rather wealthy holders. 50k is a drop in the bucket for some of these players. Imo, above some threshold for MKR delegated, delegators should be footing all or a portion of the bill. They would also be free to compensate much more than 50k. Maybe 50k (or something less? or more?) is the cap that MKR should be on the hook for per delegate, and any more can be supplied by the delegators to whatever heights they wish. ",

Only after being urged countless times, I eventually formed my own CU, and received retroactive compensation for my expenditures. As such, I can completely understand where @paperimperium is coming from here. That said, I on some level agree with @sebventures that there may be some better, more formal/optimized process for this. Maybe a grant is the way to go? Still, the amount in question, $50k, to me, does not seem absurd or astronomical. @paperimperium has clearly been delivering value, maybe in his own unique way. Whether or not everyone in our community agrees with or values his efforts and methods\u2026 to me, even though he\u2019s rather new, he\u2019s shown quite a bit of commitment and has invested a lot of his own time and energy into Maker. To @iammeeoh\u2019s comment\u2026 $50k has very different mileage in the US compared to other parts of the world.  Though\u2026 again, reading further in the comments, @makerman makes a good point as well! The $20k requested towards purchasing MKR, is reasonable, but others haven\u2019t always had the same opportunity, and have been here quite a while longer! With all that said, I am torn. There are good points on both sides. It\u2019s not a large sum in question, and if we let this pass, we\u2019re betting $50k on @paperimperium continuing to deliver value. I lean towards letting this pass. Going forward though (if this is in fact a bad precedent), things like this should go through a more formalized process. ",

                    "content": "    aburban90:  With all that said, I am torn. There are good points on both sides. It\u2019s not a large sum in question, and if we let this pass, we\u2019re betting $50k on @paperimperium continuing to deliver value.   I don\u2019t think there is a guarantee but honestly given my own situation in the past I am voting yes on this because I feel it is more important to support hard work provided in good faith on the hope that the added 20K is enough incentive to continue the support than to take it away and know for a fact @PaperImperium would do what I did - basically fold up shop, take a break and/or pull back.   This would be a lost opportunity for Maker and not worth 20K out of 50K. I just don\u2019t like the 20K being slated for MKR.   The funds are for compensation for work.   I did my work in the past and was going to take the funding being paid and actually buy MKR with it.  I still did.  I just got a ton less because of the rather long delay (6+ months) in receiving any compensation. Which again is why my comments not withstanding have changed to support this as it sits in poll.   Good faith work done with no compensation requires good faith reward. I want to echo again:     aburban90:  Going forward though (if this is in fact a bad precedent), things like this should go through a more formalized process.   MakerDAO really needs to think about setting aside a kind of above SC grants program or awards for above and beyond contributions by individuals not associated under grant or CU to recognize and encourage individuals doing work for the DAO to continue.  The goal of this would be to acknowledge the individuals for specific above and beyond work, and then if their work is something a CU could be doing, and the DAO thinks it is important, to formalize the hire or a grant for continued work by the same individual for some time into the future.   This would be a nice community way to find people for CU units and provide a form a community acknowledgement leading into grants or part time CU positions (possibly even new CUs to be formed. I know there is a grant program and we have SC but I would not be against setting aside 100-200K DAI for special MakerDAO contribution recognition awards where any one individual could nominate another and be seconded as a proposal for discussion. I would have nominated @PaperImperium long ago and feel confident there would be more than one second on this.   Our issue was @PaperImperium set the amount rather than the community having a discussion and settling on an amount.   I would have rather the nominator via consultation with Paper had come up with a satisfactory amount.   Thrown out as an idea for the community in this regard so we can find more people like @PaperImperium and bring them onboard. ",
