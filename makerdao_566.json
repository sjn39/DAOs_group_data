                    "content": "Continuing on from here into a signal poll. I would like to add ranked choice voting as an option for governance polls to prevent situations like what is currently happening in the DSR Spread reduction thread with multiple winners. The issue comes up that if we add a poll to the governance portal that has more than 2 options then we run the risk that a minority option ends up winning out over the majority-preferred options. For example, if we were to vote on a DSR Spread reduction poll with 3 options and get the following results:  Status Quo (4k MKR) 2 weeks (3.9k MKR) 1 month (3.5k MKR)  In this case the status quo wins, but perhaps the majority wants either 2 weeks or 1 month. There is currently no way to express this in a single poll. What I propose is adding an option to run polls as ranked choice polls with the ability to select your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc favorite choices in order. See Ranked voting - Wikipedia for a more detailed explanation. As @LongForWisdom said in the previous thread there are multiple ways to determine a winner with ranked choice. The main options are: Instant run-off (IVF) Description Ballots are initially counted for each voter\u2019s top choice. If a candidate has more than half of the vote based on first-choices, that candidate wins. If not, then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. The voters who selected the defeated candidate as a first choice then have their votes added to the totals of their next choice. This process continues until a candidate has more than half of the votes. Pros  Simple to implement Simple to reason about to the user  Cons  May skip over 2nd, 3rd choice if they are eliminated before your first choice. Condorcet fixes this. Spoiler effect is present. See Instant-runoff voting - Wikipedia   Condorcet Method Description A Condorcet method is one of several election methods that elects the candidate that wins a majority of the vote in every pairing of head-to-head elections against each of the other candidates, that is, a candidate preferred by more voters than any others, whenever there is such a candidate. A candidate with this property, the pairwise champion or beats-all winner, is formally called the Condorcet winner. Pros  Similar to IVF, but doesn\u2019t ignore 2nd, 3rd choices when they are eliminated before your 1st choice. See Condorcet method - Wikipedia   Cons  Algorithm is more complex to implement Not obvious to the end user why a candidate is winning  Positional Method This is a generalized version of Borda Count where each ballot gets some weight. Due to the constraints of the data this will not fit in the 32-bit integer implementation I wrote below. Borda Count Method Description The Borda count is a family of single-winner election methods in which voters rank options or candidates in order of preference. The Borda count determines the outcome of a debate or the winner of an election by giving each candidate, for each ballot, a number of points corresponding to the number of candidates ranked lower. Once all votes have been counted the option or candidate with the most points is the winner. The Borda count is intended to elect broadly acceptable options or candidates, rather than those preferred by a majority, and so is often described as a consensus-based voting system rather than a majoritarian one. Pros  Easy to implement Easy to reason about to the end user  Cons  Susceptible to tactical voting. See Borda count - Wikipedia   Implementation I\u2019ve looked over the Governance Portal code, and this looks to be a pretty straightforward change (the devs can correct me here if I\u2019m wrong). We are already using an integer (256 bits on-chain and 32-bits in the JS code) to store the vote number. If we only want to use the 32-bits then we can encode 4 bits per option (max 15 options on a poll + no vote) and give you 32 / 4 = 8 choices available. The bitwise position in the integer can give you the rank choice. IE the lowest 4 bits indicate first choice. The nice thing about this implementation is that it is backwards compatible with the current first-past-the-post system.     Do not add support for ranked choice voting Add support for ranked choice voting with the Instant-runoff method to determine the winner Add support for ranked choice voting with the Condorcet method to determine the winner Add support for ranked choice voting with the Positional method to determine the winner Add support for ranked choice voting with the Borda Count method to determine the winner Abstain (I want to see results) Abstain (I have no opinion) Abstain (I don\u2019t feel I am knowledgable on the subject) Abstain (I disagree with the poll options) Abstain (I have a different objection)     0 voters     This is a multiple choice poll, vote for  everything  you are willing to vote for in an on-chain vote. Poll will close on  February 27th, 2020 at 11:00 AM EST to be reviewed during the weekly governance call.  ",

Regarding taking the median vote (weighted by mkr), you might think it\u2019s too simple since voting will be the exact same. But the end result is the fairest compromise, right in the middle. Ranked choice voting can get quite complicated game theory wise (There is always tactical voting), and deciding which method is the most \u2018fair\u2019. Anyways, I support ranked choice voting over the current system. Assumptions: Single Peaked preferences vs Multi Peaked Preferences (someone preferring both 1 month and status quo over 2 weeks). ",

UI implementation can consist of multiple dropdown menus that appear and disappear as you vote. IE initially you have 1 dropdown, then if you select an option a 2nd one appears below. If you select a 2nd option then a 3rd one appears, etc. There should never be more then N - 1 dropdowns for N options on a poll. For IVF results you can display it like this:  Screen Shot 2020-02-15 at 3.36.50 PM876\u00d7260 12.7 KB  Alternatively you can show condensed intermediate rounds if by chopping off multiple options that have < 10% of the vote or something.

                    "content": "This is a well written post, and the summaries of each voting method are very useful. In addition, you\u2019ve made it clear that this signal is to Add ranked choice as an option rather than moving to ranked choice for any particular poll. The difference may sound small, but it\u2019s important that we see the implementation before green-lighting it\u2019s use in polls. Thanks @hexonaut for producing this. Based on the summaries and some background knowledge of voting methods I\u2019ve voted for the Condorcet and Borda Count methods. I would argue against instant-run-off based on the fact that it doesn\u2019t eliminate the spoiler effect. MKR Holders should be sure that their voting for their favourite (unpopular) option isn\u2019t going to reduce the chance of an option they find acceptable taking victory. The Condorcet method is able to find the best option if one exists, which makes it one of the better methods, however the downside is that it\u2019s calculation is not trivial. I would still find it acceptable, but I\u2019d prefer the Borda Count method, furthermore, I think everyone else should do, mainly because:     hexonaut:  The Borda count is intended to elect broadly acceptable options or candidates, rather than those preferred by a majority, and so is often described as a consensus-based voting system rather than a majoritarian one.   This is a huge point in favour of the method! In my view it\u2019s incredibly important that as a group MKR Holders don\u2019t fracture into a conflicting system of parties, votes should not be seen as a competition, but as a collaboration. The way to ensure this is to focus on \u2018most acceptable option\u2019 rather than \u2018most preferred option.\u2019 This is the same reason I have been advising everyone doing signal requests to allow multiple votes, because it does this exact same thing, pushing the focus from \u2018most preferred\u2019 to \u2018most acceptable\u2019 Also @hexonaut I don\u2019t think this con:     hexonaut:  Option may get chosen that is not supported by a majority. (Maybe this isn\u2019t a bad thing, but it\u2019s different from our current setup)   \u2026 is accurate. The issue is in the word \u2018supported.\u2019 It should be \u2018preferred\u2019. It\u2019s not guaranteed to give the preferred result if it has a majority voting for it, but it should instead result in something that is \u2018supported\u2019 (ie ranked fairly highly) by a larger group. In addition to it\u2019s \u2018Con\u2019 being it\u2019s greatest strength, The Borda Count method is also easy to implement and reason about. One con that I would highlight for Borda Count is that it is that it is more susceptible to tactical voting that some of the other methods (although no method is entirely immune.) This could become a problem if the \u2018political landscape\u2019 of our voting becomes very competitive. ",

In almost all other ways it\u2019s ideal. If we implement it and tactical voting becomes a problem we can always revisit. We shouldn\u2019t assume tactical voting will be used, especially when MKR Holders are aware that:  We view it as abuse of the system. Votes are publicly visible. Everyone is on the same team.  Regarding the context of continuously running polls, I think it\u2019s difficult to judge the outcome. It might be that tactical voting happens more in continuous polls, but it may also happen less. Because everything is public, other voters can react and respond to tactical votes. It could be that they are too much of a risk to be worth doing, because methods require you to vote contrary to your preferences. If you do this and it\u2019s public, others can react in ways that make your tactical vote a liability. ",

Initial investigation with the smart contract & development team indicate that this is technically possible to support using the existing contracts. @hexonaut is correct that there will be frontend UI work to represent the new selection options as well as some necessary modifications to the GovQueryServiceApi to treat OptionIDs as a 32 byte array of ranked options - there is some work there but it is all feasible.
