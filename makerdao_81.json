Very useful indeed.   This is quite concerning indeed.  I wonder if you can shed further light on this topic:   what are the protocols that most people/small groups/new devs/etc focus on nowadays? Why isn\u2019t Maker considered (as it used to be? - separate question)? Is this just due to the lack of PR, or the codebase/documentation/etc is complicated, etc.  Great that you see \u201chackaton activity\u201d as one of the ways forward.   I am not 100% this suffices to explain \u2026     This are the metrics that we have related to partners. ",

I car-jacked this idea  from the Stacks (BTC DeFi provider) community\u2014what do you think of a residence program in some of the regions that Growth has started to impact such as Asia, and possibly Africa where you are looking/recruiting? Check this out: GitHub - stacksgov/residence-program: Repo for all resources related to the Stacks Foundation's Residence Program, including the application and nominations process. Might be a tough program to run as you\u2019re looking to kick things off w/Grants. But maybe something for the future\u2026 ",
