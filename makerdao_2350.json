We\u2019re rethinking the community development platform to try and make it easier to use and navigate. And we\u2019d like to get your input in the process. So if you\u2019re interested in improving the community development portal, thereby improving the Maker community at large, please do sign up! You don\u2019t have to have contributed before to take part. But it helps if you\u2019ve thought about contributing in the past. What to expect from the session  Quick chat about your experiences with the MakerDAO community and contributing We\u2019ll run through a few hypothetical tasks to test some of the latest design choices  The sessions should take ~45 mins, but please make sure you have an hour free just in case. If you\u2019re interested\u2026 Reach out to me (DM or in replies) and let me know your timezone and availability. I\u2019ll then book in a Zoom call. ",
