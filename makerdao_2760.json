We provide a funding in DAI. In our mind, DAI = USD but the last months have shown that it\u2019s not exactly what is happening in the real world. In a competitive landscape, having a currency exchange risk is the problem of the lender, not the borrower (as he wants to borrow USD not DAI). Currently, the best idea seems to subsidize the currency risk by lowering the asked stability fee. The math will roughly be the following (values are illustrative only): Borrowed amount: 10M USD Agreed upon interest rate: 5% (as a USD loan) Maturity: 1 year Cost of hedging the DAI-USD exchange rate: 100k (1 year forward price on a 10M notional). We would get a quote from a OTC desk. Vault stability fee: 4% (5% minus 100k/10M pro-rata the maturity) That\u2019s clearly not perfect but it\u2019s the best way I\u2019m aware for now. Other options are providing USD loans through a real world legal entity (a whole new legal problem) or providing a DAI volatility hedging module (no clue how to do that, open if someone has a smart SC idea). For RWA, would you agree to subsidize DAI volatility concerns by lowering the stability fees?     yes no unsure abstain     0 voters     Please also provide comments and ideas  ",

If you are taking out a loan that costs you 10% per year, this movement of DAI could be more costly than the interest you pay. Because of the exchange rate fluctuation every asset originator ended up getting an exchange hedge. These hedges have cost around 0.4% for a 60 day forward. In the long run I think this will be a non-issue as @psychonaut is pointing out but I think in the short term I think it\u2019s in Maker\u2019s best interest to price this into the calculation. ",

This question should be laid before the rates and risk group for analysis and comment first. I am against it because it sets bad precident and will still be a risk lever that RWA will have to deal with and will complain about constantly.  It will create this otc review every 90days work for rates team to boot along with other rate setting duties and complicate their job. I do not think adjusting rates is going to carry the kind of compensation required for RWA borrowers.  It is the prime problem I see with RWA is that they live in a very competitive rate/term environment.  There are a lot of companies that operate world wide borrowing or loaning money in different currencies.  They use forex currency options to hedge these risks over the terms they need. I\u2019d rather allow these kinds of currency markets form to service them before having Maker trying to take on what in effect is a currency risk exposure on top of our massively growing stablecoin LR101 exposure. I honestly would want to hear from rate and risk groups on whether they think this is a sound approach. ",

That puts us with a disadvantage in the competitive landscape. Nevertheless, as our cost of capital is low, and we need DAI to be minted to solve the peg, this isn\u2019t a big issue. Obviously, the situation can change in the future and we might become uncompetitive. You are right that market can develop in the future to lower the cost of DAI/USD hedging.

                    "content": "Perhaps a useful analogy is when a borrower takes a loan in a different currency from the one needed. Some years ago it was popular to take Japanese Yen loans for property in other countries, because of the low rate of interest in Japan. Though the exchange rate with JPY is stable for long periods of time, during black swan events or extreme market volatility, the rate can move in large steps very suddenly, especially in the direction of JPY becoming stronger. In 2013, for example, the Yen became 30% stronger within a month. This caused widespread defaults when mortgage payments suddenly became 30% larger. The net result was that Japanese or Australian banks will no longer offer Yen loans on foreign property. DAI vs USD is not as large an issue as DAI vs other currencies, such as Euro, and are we considering other fiat currencies? Whether the borrower takes on hedging contracts is difficult to enforce, so it is worth considering that the SPV take on that cost and pass it along to the borrower. Another idea is a time delay of a week or two that could allow the exchange rate to settle in the case of very sudden extreme volatility, as occurred in March. It remains true that local loans in the needed currency are the main competition, but presumably the borrower sees DAI as attractive because of a lower interest rate or inaccessibility of local loans (due to environmental factors, not creditworthiness). A hedge and/or buffer will increase attractiveness of DAI loans. Also I would add that one bad case of an extreme problem will cause a major issue in terms of market perception in the real world. ",
