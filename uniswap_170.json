            "body": "Following the discussion the Uniswap community had during the community call 20 we came to conclusion that community likes this idea.\n\nHowever the technicalities of the execution itself are something to be discussed. If you check the unicode adoption website adopting a character can only be done via credit card. This means funds we raise need to be converted to FIAT and only then a payment can be made.\n\nApproaches we discussed are:\n\n1) Someone we trust in the community creates an address and everyone in the community can donate to that address. That person will then make a donation using credit card and they will be reimbursed with crypto assets we raise.\n\n2) Several members create a multisig and process is pretty much the same as 1)\n\n3) We utilize a PartyDAO (https://www.partybid.app/)  where either individual or several members put up an NFT for sale. If we reach a target and NFT is sold that funds can then be used in similar way as 1) and 2)\n\n4) Trusted member of the community makes a grant proposal to the UGP (https://www.unigrants.org/)\n\nDuring the community call it was agreed that BOR4 (myself) will make this vote on snapshot.\n\nPS if you don't have UNI delegated to you but you are still interested in participating you can also leave a comment on gov forum and we will take this feedback also in the account.

That person will then make a donation using credit card and they will be reimbursed with crypto assets we raise.   This is worded in a confusing way. The way I am reading this is, someone raises $5,000 from many individuals by those individuals donating their own money. The person who is trusted to sell the $5000 donated crypto for USD and use the credit card, gets reimbursed $5000 in UNI? Doesnt make much sense that the person gets to profit $5000 from donations made by individuals in the community. It would make more sense if the person were to have to reimburse all those who donated with the $5000 from the treasury. I assume this is what was meant by the snapshot. Under this assumption. Using PartyDAO (option #3) is a great idea. I would like to add that it would be pretty cool if the treasury could buy the NFT of the adopted Unicorn Emoji from the PartyDAO, while also reibursing those holding the partyDAO % contributed token (i.e. UNICODE token).

I also do not think this will pass an onchain vote. It may also be too small even for UGP, but maybe Uni Stable is a better fit (Uni Stable was created for community oriented projects)? A smaller initiative, that goes under the line of sponsorship, experimenting with PartyDAO and being able to send a NFT memento back into the treasury. Another reason to use PartyDAO: If the donator is recieving 5k in crypto, selling it for fiat, and then recieving 5k again to send out as a reimbursement. This may create a complicated tax situation for that person. Would be easier with PartyDAO as the NFT itself would be bought back from the contributor\u2019s at their % rather than the donator recieving more money, and then having to send the funds recieved from reimbursement back out to contributors.
