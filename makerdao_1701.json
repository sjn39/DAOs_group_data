                    "content": " MIP85: LDO-to-MKR OTC Swap  Preamble MIP#: 85 Title: LDO-to-MKR OTC Swap Author(s): @rune Contributors: @juan, @retro Tags: endgame Type:  Status: Withdrawn Date Proposed: 2022-09-07 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd> Dependencies: Replaces:  Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mipxx-ldo-to-mkr-otc-swap/17714 Ratification Poll URL:    Sentence Summary MIP85 is an optional Endgame Launch Plan MIP that provides the DAO an opportunity to trade MKR for LDO, at a discount, to jumpstart the Protocol Owned Vault Emulation.  Paragraph Summary This MIP is completely optional, if it is rejected it doesn\u2019t impact the approval of the Endgame Plan. The proposal is to swap 20 million LDO from Rune\u2019s holding company, Calteram Holdings for MKR in the Maker Pause Proxy at a large discount in Maker\u2019s favor. The LDO was originally obtained as early-stage investor in Lido.  Component Summary MIP85c1: OTC Swap Party Definitions Defines the parties involved in the OTC swap. MIP85c2: OTC Swap Commitment Defines the commitment of each party involved in the OTC swap. MIP85c3: OTC Swap Process Defines the process for the OTC swap. MIP85c4: OTC Swap Exchange Rate Defines how the Exchange Rate will be used in the OTC swap. MIP85c5: OTC Swap Exchange Rate Calculation Defines how the Exchange Rate will be calculated for the OTC swap. MIP85c6: MIP4 Amendment Block Clause & Automatic Depreciation Blocks any Governance actions from revoking or modifying the terms of the OTC swap if the MIP is ratified.  Motivation LDO has 3-5x the liquidity of MKR and is currently one of hottest tokens among smart money, and it is extremely hard to get ahold of large allocations. Maker owning a large LDO stake helps make the economic dynamics of the early Endgame Plan come full circle by giving Maker exposure to the increased adoption of Lido Staked ETH, and provides the Protocol Owned Vault Emulation a lot of starting collateral to build a larger position, to help increase the decentralization of Dai.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP85c1: OTC Swap Party Definitions This MIP establishes an OTC deal between MakerDAO and Calteram Holdings.  MIP85c2: OTC Swap Commitment If the MIP is approved, MakerDAO Governance commits to send MKR from the Pause Proxy after receiving LDO from Calteram Holdings to a predetermined Ethereum Address.  MIP85c3: OTC Swap Process The transfers will be in two rounds, with the first swap of about 75% of the amount to be done immediately following the successful vote, and the second swap of what remains of the 20000000 LDO happening around December 17, 2022 (due to remaining vesting periods). The exchange rate will be the same in both transactions, and will follow the MIP85c5.  MIP85c4: OTC Swap Exchange Rate The exact rate of the swap will be locked at the moment the vote ends successfully. It will be determined based on the formula in MIP85c5 that gives a higher discount to Maker if MKR is lower relative to LDO, and a lower discount if MKR is higher relative to LDO.  MIP85c5: OTC Swap Exchange Rate Calculation The exchange rate is calculated by looking at the official exchange rate of LDO per MKR on Coingecko at the moment the MIP is approved, and then applying a bonus to the amount of LDO per MKR according to the formula below. The result determines how much MKR Maker Governance must return for LDO received following the passing of this MIP.  Increase to LDO per MKR exchange rate based on relative exchange rates:  MKR/LDO 751+ = +10% MKR/LDO 701-750 = +15% MKR/LDO 651-700 = +20% MKR/LDO 601-650 = +25% MKR/LDO 551-600 = +30% MKR/LDO 501-550 = +35% MKR/LDO 451-500 = +41% MKR/LDO 401-450 = +47% MKR/LDO 351-400 = +53% MKR/LDO 301-350 = +59% MKR/LDO 251-300 = +65% MKR/LDO 201-250 = +71% MKR/LDO 151-200 = +77% MKR/LDO 101-150 = +83% MKR/LDO 51-100 = +90% MKR/LDO 1-50 = +100%    ",

Restricting this swap to a known entity could also serve to reduce the legitimacy of the endgame plan. Something which I believe is the opposite of the intention of this proposal. To create peace and stability surrounding a strategic direction.   I\u2019ve also have put a lot of thought into this MIP\u2014and I don\u2019t have all the right answers, but this is how I\u2019m thinking about it. More than likely I\u2019m misunderstanding your message here, Excuse me if I am\u2014but when deeply thinking about this proposal, I believe the intention of this MIP is to allow MakerDAO to accumulate LDO for the Protocol Owned Vault Emulation (POVE) via OTC versus using the dssKiln which could be front-run, sandwiched, and every thing else in between. Adding LDO increases the Surplus Buffer along with DAI, AAVE, ENS, and whatever else I\u2019m forgetting (VELO on OP) that makes up the treasury.     JustinCase:  My proposal for amendment would therefore be to allow other participants that wish to join a swap on the same terms as presented, do so. Practically this could be set up as a book building process, with either a max cap on MKR distributed, or without a cap. Set a deadline for commitment and conduct the swap for all parties involved at a specified time.   Personally, and this is Not Financial Advice\u2014I would not swap my LDO for MKR at a discount. Or even at Par. First of all,  I believe LidoDAO has the opportunity to blossom\u2014it\u2019s very early for that community and they seem eager to contribute to the future of Web3. Second\u2014also because I\u2019m a big believer in diversification\u2014which IMO is an alternative way to think about the acquisition of  LDO when thinking about diversifying MakerDAO\u2019s treasury. And last but not least, this actually works in favor of diversifying LDO token ownership. Their have been many public  complaints from the ecosystem about Lido having too large of a pie, when it comes to validating/staking services (responsible for approximately 30%) for ETH 2.0. By acquiring LDO, you extend the token ownership and diversified to a group of MKR token owners that can help in the decentralization of LidoDAO. Who knows, perhaps some of the Delegates here can get Delegated LDO and help shape the future of LidoDAO. ",

There was no reason for Maker to purchase LDO at any point and there still isn\u2019t. Directly buying stETH makes sense for POVE, buying LDO does not. It\u2019s a governance token and does not have long term value accrual mechanism. It seems Rune wants to exit his LDO position and Maker is the only way to do it without losing a shit ton to market slippage. Additionally, MKR is at an all time low in ETH terms so great deal again for anyone buying MKR. The protocol is not financially better off after this deal.     rune:  Increase to LDO per MKR exchange rate based on relative exchange rates:  MKR/LDO 751+ = +10%    This is not very clear. I post what I understand from it below. Does this mean that after 750 MKR have been transferred, the remaining MKR is sold for LDO at a 10% discount compared to the price on CoinGecko? Without slippage, 20M LDO is worth $36M at the moment. In MKR terms, that\u2019s 55,300 MKR. Ignoring the first 750 which is basically a rounding error, what this seems to say is that the entire 55,000 MKR is sold for LDO with just a 10% discount on Coingecko\u2019s price? If so, I don\u2019t see how this is a large discount in Maker\u2019s favor - 10% is peanuts when it means acquiring an asset we otherwise wouldn\u2019t for 75% of all MKR in the treasury.     rune:  The exchange rate is calculated by looking at the official exchange rate of LDO per MKR on Coingecko  at the moment the MIP is approved   And if all this isn\u2019t enough, with the amount of LDO available here to Rune, it\u2019s very easy to manipulate liquidity and artificially lower the price on CoinGecko just before the MIP passes. There\u2019s no way to prevent the market from being manipulated and for Maker to lose even more on this deal. This is insane! ",

If rune is doing this to acquire more MKR tokens, he will be even more invested in the success of the MKR token, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to cuck the DAO.     squid:  It seems Rune wants to exit his LDO position and Maker is the only way to do it without losing a shit ton to market slippage.   To add to a MKR position that he would have even more trouble exiting (lower liquidity + public eye)?     squid:  This is not very clear. I post what I understand from it below. Does this mean that after 750 MKR have been transferred, the remaining MKR is sold for LDO at a 10% discount compared to the price on CoinGecko?   It was clear to me. You have it way wrong. Look at this quote in the OP:     rune:  based on relative exchange rates   Price of MKR is 630.82 right now. Price of LDO is 1.81. The relative exchange rate is 630.82/1.81 or 348.5. This means if the MIP passed today, we would fall into the following bucket and get a FIFTY NINE percent bonus on the LDO acquisition.     rune:  MKR/LDO 301-350 = +59%       squid:  And if all this isn\u2019t enough, with the amount of LDO available here to Rune, it\u2019s very easy to manipulate liquidity and artificially lower the price on CoinGecko just before the MIP passes. There\u2019s no way to prevent the market from being manipulated and for Maker to lose even more on this deal.   This is a somewhat legitimate concern but we could account for this multiple ways, one of which would be to dox the address the LDO tokens are being held in & have a provision which prevents those from moving. Another would be to take some sort of moving average at the time of MIP approval. Edit: actually this last one is not a legit concern. If rune manipulated the price of LDO lower, the LDO bonus % would be less, but the base exchange rate would be much more favorable for Maker (and less for rune). Both the bonus % and the overall exchange rate is set when the MIP passes. ",

It is also revenue generating, taking a cut from all Lido Staked ETH and eventually paying it out as dividends once this is activated by governance\u2026 which is why there is very good synergy between basing the entire economic foundation of the early Endgame Plan on stETH and then owning a large stake of LDO.
