                    "content": " MIP55c3-SP2: Create RealDAO SPF to make Moloch-based SPVs  Preamble MIP55c3-SP#: 2 Author(s): James McCall Contributors:LexDAO and RealDAO Tags: RWA Status: Withdrawn Date Applied: 2021-11-23 Date Ratified: yyyy-mm-dd Amount Requested: 50,000 DAI Recipient Address: LexDAO Resolver - 0x5B620676E28693fC14876b035b08CbB1B657dF38   Sentence Summary The purpose of this subproposal is to create a 50k Dai SPF to provide a prototype SPV DAO with a template code deference agreement.  Motivation It is necessary to the future of MakerDAO to be able to manage RWA on-chain in a permissionless manner.  Create legal entity DAOs (\u201cLAOs\u201d) using Moloch \u201cInvestment DAO\u201d frameworks. Design the LAOs to hold assets similar to how a SPV functions off-chain. Provide membership interests and governance rights that allow Dai to be minted against the SPV assets. Explore what would on-chain remedies look like against RWA collateral. The RWA brainstorm was highlighted in an earlier post here and further fleshed out in blog post here, and received positive feedback in this signal.  There are enormous advantages in the ability to have \u201coriginators\u201d or individuals form single asset/single purpose DAOs that can be governed on-chain and \u201cresolved\u201d in a permissionless manner. In light of the new \u201cClean Money\u201d proposal, there would be clear use cases to finance green energy and carbon capture\u2013for example, these SPVs could own solar farms, methane digesters, carbon offsets and credits, organic transition financing, sequester carbon through land use, etc. Agriculture finance\u2013which is my specialty\u2013will need a wide range of investment into ESG goods, which are often difficult to provision using traditional financing. I see specific needs in the previously mentioned areas, and each of these would be good candidates to place the real-world assets into the SPV to finance.  Special Purpose Fund Name RealDAO SPF  1080\u00d71080 142 KB   Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials LexDAO - Repository of Legal Engineering Primitives - LexDAO \u00b7 GitHub. Medium LexDAOism - open-sourcing ideas and thought leadership in the legal and organizational development space. RealDAO - Proof of concept that can be extended easily to manage assets from a DAO. The following LexDAO primitives are stitched together to demonstrate the pattern of onchain asset control and management:   LexSummoner - to easily and quickly generate DAO native legal shells that would provide cognizable benefit to house assets RealNFT - NFT minting contract with cognizable advantages as it is permissioned to a \u201cDAO\u201d to control the functions, ownable, whitelistable, burnable, pausable. Current version here. Dispute Resolution - May be part of agreement between the SPV LLC and the intermediary that is providing DAI or more \u201cat risk\u201d lenders of first resort tranche.  LexLocker contract - Used to lock the NFT or perhaps proceeds and payments into a double sided (buyer/seller) escrow smart contract. There are no intermediaries unless either the buyer or seller hails a resolver, locking the NFT for swift resolution.  Is MakerDAO willing to earmark RWA funds for building the proof of concept of having legally formed DAOs, which can own an RWA, that is represented by NFTs? The Single Purpose Entity would also develop ideas and frameworks to allow a SPV DAO to have shifting governance over a pool of assets using the Moloch v3 (unaudited) framework discussed in Baal.  Funding Request - \u201cThe Ask\u201d 50K to help build an open source infrastructure core to the decentralized future of MakerDAO. All the aforementioned DAOs have a strong history of providing open source and available goods to the public commons. See below for the an example flowchart deliverable for DAOs to own and manage real property assets.  1600\u00d71173 191 KB   Pros and Cons  Main benefits  Using SPV mechanisms based on Moloch are much easier to cordon off and manage for regulatory and systematic risk as each can be a legally cognizable entity organized as a legal shell and DAO. Legal simplicity is that they would be governed by organization laws of states that have a long history of using the LLC frameworks. On-chain mechanics allow real time monitoring of the real assets and digital entitlements. The dual legal frameworks would allow traceability and transparency to follow the chain of title. For example, the deed and the title report could be put into the NFT\u2019s metadata. Flexibility - Obviously the DAO model above would be useful for a wide range of assets. Most assets can be legally held in an LLC organization, and through code deference the DAO smart contract can be programmed to manage the asset in the form of an SPV. In other words, this model should be extensible to other asset classes.   Downsides  Regulatory - It may be difficult to navigate in the US (and other jurisdictions) as there is current regulatory uncertainty. If the distributed ledger world is saddled with it\u2019s own set of onerous regulations, it may make sense to just follow a traditional finance path. Smart Contract Risk - Obviously with any custody of assets of value, there are questions associated with smart contract risk, audits, and recovery. These can be mitigated by using trusted frameworks, audits, and legal disclaimers.   Funding Breakdown   25K to develop single asset LLC \u201ccode deference\u201d operating agreement and legal forms based on Wyoming LLC organization code.  Code Deference Agreement template based on Wyoming would be provided to allow MakerDAO legal team to add additional garnish. Once approved can use a similar mechanism to LexSummoner allowing LLC generation and minting with DAO using DaoHaus framework. This is a basic \u201cpush button\u201d organization with a DAO as frontend, with the code deference agreement to manage certain parameters of the operating agreement.    20K for Smart Contract specifications of Baal to allow for governance shifting of control based on event of payment default.  Moloch share interests are inherently not bearer instruments. This makes them basically impossible to pledge or hypothecate the membership interests. Newer models will allow more extensibility to allow for DAOs to pledge membership interests (tokens) as collateral Pledging these tokens would allow a further helper contract to split the ownership of the LLC from its governance. In this way, it can be possible for a remedy of sale or dissolution of the assets held by the SPV.   5K for management.

I recently came across a write-up that said: \u201cStrong smart contracts have prohibitive costs of revocation and modification, while weak smart contracts do not. This means that if a court is able to alter a contract after it has been executed with relative ease, then it will be defined as a weak smart contract.\u201d Also, have you thought about the concept of a prediction smart contract as a binary option contract that triggers when an event occurs? Hopefully that makes sense. ",

An example would be that the DAO SPV, could vote to sign and or ratify agreements, that are hashed to IPFS.  That way the record of the ratified and signed lease is on chain as a matter of record.  This would be the primitive state necessary to pledge the assets, or enter into other agreements.  Generally it is my experience that the right to contract is a strong right that is recognized by courts.  This deference to the intent of the parties, in the four corners of an agreement can guide, contracts and entity operating agreements. The LLC operating agreement would be a \u201ccode deference agreement\u201d that directs the governance of the LLC to the smart contract for predefined matters. A lease, would look like a normal lease between parties that could be cryptographically signed, or probably more likely, just signed by a designated party ratified by the vote of the SPV LAO.  The document would be scanned to IPFS (or similar) hashed and related back to the vote. One would also likely expect that the parties would choose alternative dispute resolution \u201cADR\u201d as their contracted remedies.  In this way, the parties could at least signal the base rules that they chose to have a dispute mediated/arbitrated in as code deferential manner as possible. Your questions are good ones as most of these matters are likely of first impression.  But I think there is a growing amount of scholarship The Law and Legality of Smart Contracts by Max Raskin :: SSRN as an example on how courts should start to look at these matters (should it become necessary).  That said, I have not seen any specific adjudication yet. I am too really interested in the possibility of prediction markets, binary, as well as mechanisms such as Kleros, but I still think they are in the process of spinning off rough edges to say the least. But to the extent that the parties are dealing with real assets, they are going to be subject to local, state and federal rules and that will need to be the manner of managing ownership \u201cdeeds\u201d, and perfecting security interests and managing normal transactions (property taxes, recording, UCC, etc.).

The challenge is creating the link between Maker Governance and then the actual enforcement and rights to the collateral asset, and knowing that when shit hits the fan, Maker Governance is actually able to liquidate and recover the collateral, even if all the people involved have gone rogue and are pulling all the legal tricks they have up their sleeves. In my opinion the clear winner is to use top tier trustees, like trust companies or banks, to oversee a trust that has full rights with no catch of any kind, and is then linked to Maker Governance (so that a governance vote triggers the trustee to liquidate the trust, and the trustee automatically pays interest income or liquidation proceeds into the Maker Surplus buffer). This has already been achieved and is running live with the 6S legal structure and WSFS as the trustee, and is also what centrifuge is now developing (I believe also with WSFS as the trustee). Monetalis is also developing a solution for this using european trusts (I believe Luxembourg based) for UK and EU. For sure it\u2019s not yet perfect and it can still be improved further, and I think that fixing their remaining flaws and double checking all aspects of them is where the ROI of doing research into RWA structure and recourse is highest, because they are so incredibly scalable. From the perspective of an MKR holder it is much more appealing to rely on a structure where the entity that has to be trusted with actually enforcing our collateral rights is a reputable, capitalized and regulated entity, because then they are putting their reputation and potentially even regulatory standing on the line in terms of whether the structure is compliant and enforceable, and they typically have decades or centuries of experience and trust built up focused on safeguarding institutional assets.

And what if the trust is directed by a random actor while the LLC is directed by DAO Resolutions? Monetalis is indeed a good legal setup (using BVI) as it takes direction from MakerDAO, but everything is off-chain. We need to use what is done in TradFi but maybe we also need to innovate using the blockchain. I have no clue if this proposal is good or not, but it brings a crypto mindset. I\u2019ve set the RWF to go full stream towards TradFi institutions (because I think it is better, therefore hiring TradFi people), having some free thinkers exploring other ways could be useful just to remind us that we hoped to create something better than TradFi, not the same thing using DeFi capital.

I am struck with the importance of trying to remove as much trust/intermediaries as are possible in both the protocol and to the extent that the protocol begins to touch real world assets, then the real world.  To me that is the power of decentralized protocols is to remove intermediaries and replace with trustless \u201con-chain\u201d, transparent, mechanisms. At the very least, I look at this as an insurance policy that could be used to the extent that some regulatory leverage is applied on smaller nation states and more centralized intermediaries, then there would be a Plan B.  At times I feel maybe we are too early, but I laugh that the next MKR series is on UNA\u2019s which we used to provide some code deference for our own DAO a year and a half ago.  That said, being too early is still just as wrong. I really look at the model of having standalone SPV\u2019s that are cordoned off as very complementary to an originator or pooler model of debt origination.  What I mean is that 50 SPV\u2019s \u201cnodes\u201d could be aggregated into one centralized (but compliant) lender and then a credit facility can be entered to mint dai direct against this pool.  The originators could be forced to stake a \u201ccarry\u201d against the loans they originate to avoid people throwing spaghetti against the wall.  And the Credit Facility, could be bond rated.  The benefit to this over a tradefi approach is that the ownership of the assets would be owned and controlled on-chain which would make the digitization of rights (as ERC20s, or NFT\u2019s) possible and transparent and auditable on chain and back off chain - to deeds of record, UCC\u2019s, etc. I am also not a \u201ctrust\u201d expert, but in looking at the 6S model it appears to me that there are plenty of choke points and intermediaries each of which can go on the lam.  Murphy\u2019s law if it can go wrong, it will go wrong as this cautionary tale illustrates How Bridging Finance fooled Bay Street \u2013 and hundreds of millions of dollars disappeared - The Globe and Mail. I don\u2019t claim to have all the answers, but was willing to try and humbly put some brain synapses to work to try and further the cause to make this stuff work in as decentralized and transparent manner as possible.

I may have become a bit too grumpy about this because of my experience with some of the early experimental structures we\u2019re exposed to. My central question is, who is the trusted counterparty in this structure that we have to trust not to screw us over? Because there is always someone in that position. In a trustee based structure, it\u2019s simple - you have to trust the trustee. They are going to review the structure end to end and stake their reputation and regulatory standing on the whole thing being workable and performing as expected. This makes sense because their entire profession is basically to be in that position. So with this kind of model, if it was set up in practice, where would such a \u201ctrust anchor\u201d exist, and how do we know we can trust them if they aren\u2019t an established trustee or similar? My fear is that if it\u2019s not someone explicitly built into the structure, then the trust anchor would in practice be the core units and maker contributors that set the structure up \u201con behalf of the DAO\u201d that would have to be trusted to not have put some kind of backdoor in there, and to not have made some kind of mistake or missed a risk vector. These people would also control the relationships with lawyers etc. This creates private entanglement issues because it\u2019s hard to know what happens if you fire them, or they disappear, or get pissed off, or turned out to be incompetent etc. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the willingness to look with fresh eyes.  To answer your question of where the trust is I think it is important to note a few things or safeguards.   Obviously the idea would be to trust an originator or arranger node that is staking on the overall group of single asset LLC\u2019s and or the series.  In honestly this is the \u201ccredit\u201d component that is the equivalent to loan credit approval.  How much dai to lend on this asset or bucket of assets.  This part is path dependent on what originator model the DAO settles on.  Perhaps even the originator has first loss component.  But I know that this is being worked on in other governance channels.   In the RealDAO SPF concept you are basically going to trust code and that the LLC and structure are enforceable under state law.  So in the US, LLC membership interests in the USA are often used as collateral for things, personal guarantees, etc.  When these are foreclosed on through a process called a charging order (depending on state).  Upon foreclosure depending on the operating agreement and state law, the lender often gets the economic rights in the LLC, but not the governance rights.  This makes sense in multiple member LLC\u2019s as they don\u2019t want to have a bank sitting around the coffee table making day to day decisions.  Basically the bank is a minority interest member that just has to sit around and wait for the LLC to \u201cdo something\u201d sell, or pay out to its members and it can use this proceeds.  This is obviously not ideal from the lender\u2019s perspective.   In a single asset LLC (as proposed) the borrower would basically pledge all of its membership interests (or at least enough to govern the LLC).  In this manner it behaves similar to a MKR vault currently.  Pay or else you risk liquidation which doesn\u2019t really come with any other obligations.  The minter in the vault can walk they just forego their tokens.  I would strongly suggest that the parties build in due process/cure into the smart contract structure, so that even upon a payment default the membership shares begin leaking out via a geyser to a MakerDAO \u201ctrusted\u201d intermediary, perhaps over six months to a year.  This intermediary could be a Trustee or could be a MKR employee, or multisig etc.  Obviously then the governance rights over the assets would shift between the minter and the chosen MakerDAO representative.  This would be the equivalent of increasing pressure similar to filing a foreclosure action on a property.  One would hope that the original party would then make haste to wind down the loan, cure the delinquent facility, market the property, etc.   But even if they just \u201cwalk\u201d then the designated party would gain enough governance control in the LLC to take over.  In this way, it would behave very similarly to the trust model where eventually the trustee needs to \u201cdo something\u201d to sell the assets to recover.   The DAO obviously has some very capable outside/inside lawyers and tweaks would likely need to be done to the form operating agreement.  Perhaps a trustee or trusted party needs to be implemented to make it bankruptcy remote.  But even in cases of bankruptcy single asset, LLC are generally a much smoother process of resolution.   In other words, I think that this single asset LLC structure could be complimentary to working with 3rd party trustees, though that is not a panacea either.  Trustees go rogue and die and do drugs, etc.  But I get your point.  I just think I would prefer a trustless scenario with designated powers from MakerDAO governance, versus directly with 3rd party trustees.  But that might just be a preference. ",
