I\u2019ve also started working with @Aleborda21, who has done a wonderful job putting together a resource library on the subject with information on 100s of DAOs.  We plan to release a small book in PDF/softcover at DevConnect on 4/21.  It would catalogue over 100 ImpactDAOs, and here is what it would look like:  Cover1920\u00d71175 245 KB   Extending this momentum I would like to challenge the community to extend this momentum.  I would like to see a ImpactDAO RatingsDAO emerge. The RatingsDAO would maintain an important money lego: a Proof of Impact.  Such a DAO would maintain an on-chain registry of which ImpactDAOs have what Impact.  Such a money lego could be used to facilitate trustless smart contract functionality only available to ImpactDAOs, and would also allow ImpactDAOs to display an independently verified \u201cProof Of Impact\u201d. This RatingsDAO could solicit & ingest attestations about a DAO\u2019s social impact, independently verify their impact, and then issue a report card on them.    (here is a write up I did a few weeks ago about what such an attestation framework could look like) The Report cards would perhaps be available via smart contract and then also via a beautiful web interface. Here are two mocks of what an ImpactDAO rating card could look like (all numbers made up, for demonstration purposes only):  Screen Shot 2022-03-22 at 8.18.29 PM898\u00d7388 111 KB   Screen Shot 2022-03-22 at 8.18.24 PM896\u00d7348 97.5 KB  I think that the above ratings primitive could be deeply valuable to the space if  it has a deep liqudity of ratings. it is backed by a highly legitimate governance. The governance should also be uncapture-able and hella forkable.  ImpactDAOs should be able to/invited to participate in the conversation about their impact. it\u2019d be nice if it plugged into other money legos, like say Gitcoin Grants 2.0.  Allowing Gitcoin Grants to display Impact Ratings in it\u2019s UI  Such a ratings primitive could be used to create interesting new smart contract modifiers available only to DAOs with high impact scores.

If so, I would like to talk to you. Please (1) join this telegram (2) post a proposal below in 500 words or less that articulates how you would attack this problem and what would have to be true for it to happen (hint: please ask for funding, I want to fund good proposals!). I have budget to fund as many promising proposals as I receive, and will decide how to spend that budget on a case by case basis. ",

                    "content": "Hi guys! Protein is looking to build a web3 version of BCorp/MSCI to make it easier for ImpactDAOs to access funding, investment and other novel mechanisms to boost their impact. There is a need for impact investors and philanthropists to be able to synthesize due diligence, using the tools of web3 to escape the siloed and proprietary approach of legacy ESG initiatives. A token curated registry (TCR) of ImpactDAOs with their validated impact / traction scores would create a key ingredient in a composable ecosystem to improve the collective impact of the web3 world. Such registry is basically a curated list of impact DAOs, which enables discovery of impactDAOs for potential contributors, investors, funders. Each ImpactDAO receives an on-chain score from a validator, allowing for investment vehicles and other token mechanics / governance to be built on top. For example a tracker fund could invest in the 10 highest impact across all projects, or the 10 highest impact in solving the food crisis, or buy a crypto ETF based on the tokens of top DAOs across specific areas of impact (for retail investors). Alternatively, an active donor fund could use this list to adjust its recurring / streaming donation. Conversely, a certain score could be used for gating access to the list, e.g. on the Regen Stack for web3 orgs that want to address their impacts but are outside of their expertise: highly rated forestry might be recommended for offsetting, highly rated design for reuse featured for laptops equipment, etc. The impact rating can be kept honest due to 1) crypto economic incentives for evaluation / challenging scores and adding / removing DAOs from the registry, 2) robust governance system that would ensure legitimacy of the process. This grant would allow us to reach the goals of Stage 1:  Develop the scoring mechanism v1 - impact values that validators would be attesting to. These could range from internal policies and processes through to verifiable impacts. Design the incentive structure v1 required to ensure all eligible ImpactDAOs are scored and that their scores are an accurate reflection (this would include arbitration mechanisms). Validate the demand from potential investors (consumers of the curated list)  What we need  35,000 USDC Support from RatingsDAO / access to talent from ICC/Gitcoin network (e.g. for game theory and token engineering)  Once Stage 1 is completed, we\u2019ll look for additional support to:  Prototype the investable TCR Build frontend for ease of navigation Train validators / evaluation agents to use our scoring mechanism Kickstart the ecosystem for decentralized validation of ImpactDAOs, incl. supplying it with the necessary liquidity  Who we are Protein Community is a community DAO, building out the Good Growth standard and cultural / regenerative accelerator. We\u2019ve just released our pilot cohort, supporting and funding projects that \u2018bring under-represented communities into the new economy\u2019. We are currently evaluating our approach before our next \u201crecelerator\u201d which focuses on supporting projects and their regen stack. You can learn more about us on Twitter @protein ",

I lead a community of SDG stakeholders and professionals and I work with startups to help them align their KPIs with impact KPIs, indicators, and frameworks. Our proposal is to align impact metrics and values with monetary values and streamline their incorporation into transactions through an \u201cImpact Oracle\u201d. Why? Over the years we\u2019ve noticed that much of impact accounting is a mess of acronyms that create a race to the bottom. Companies do the minimum in order to be up to par with regulation/certificates. This is because we fundamentally do not have metrics that value impact in monetary terms (outside of marketing). Essentially, ESG, SDGs, IMP, GRI, SASB, and other acronyms and methodologies are \u201cpatches\u201d to an economic system that does not value environmental and social impact. Our economic system \u201cspeaks in money\u201d and we respond with qualitative impact analysis. We \u201cpatch\u201d our economy with certifications, verifications, and different tags or stickers that symbolize that the goods or services are aligned with our values, but this does not change the context of the system. What? Impact Oracle (IO) is a price oracle for impact that draws on market values and stakeholder consensus. Instead of creating a rigid top-down accounting for impact, we decentralize the process and allow the price of impact to reflect its actual value in monetary terms. IO maintains a registry of the value of impact, as a flexible, ad-hoc, community-sourced metric. Constantly evolving, living, and changing with the needs and values of the ecosystem. Just as prices of commodities and assets change with market demands, so must impact. Using this pricing, IO compensates for positive impact and offsets negative impact. By creating a price for every type of impact we create a new metric for businesses to measure against. By making this metric monetary, we create a new potential revenue stream and incentivize a race to the top: More impact = more profit. This creates transparency, impact, alignment, and transformation of the economic incentives in our economy like never before. IO creates a system in which verification of impact is an all-in-one process. Any organization, DAO or otherwise, can streamline their impact accounting, getting compensation for positive impact and offsetting their negative. How? By connecting to legacy systems such as the company\u2019s logistics, supply, ERM software, etc. we can correlate their actual activities with their real impact. We don\u2019t need to track each DAO or company individually as we can connect with MRV systems, tokenization frameworks, and existing data. More on the \u201cHow\u201d in our lite paper which I\u2019d be happy to share. What we\u2019re looking for: We are currently building the tokenomics and governance system and building partnerships with relevant stakeholders to supply capital and professional resources. This should be a cross-chain endeavor and we would like for it to be built for Ethereum as well as other blockchains. Any of the following would be of massive help:  35K USDC for an MVP of the Oracle Professional and tech support from the ICC community Community-building support for the IO DAO through Gitcoin and others  (This proposal is similar to a proposal in the the \u201cImpact Certificate\u201d thread - if one is accepted, we will rescind the other) ",
