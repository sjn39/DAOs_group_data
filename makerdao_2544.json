Initially I thought the issue to be with MetaMask, so I have described the issue in full detail here: https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/8146 I\u2019ve been told this is probably the right place to ask after all, as it does not seem to be a problem on the MetaMask side. To summarize, when I try to withdraw the remaining MKR I have in the voting contract, my transactions fail with a \u2018ds-token-insufficient-approval\u2019 error. Do you know what could be the cause of this, and, more importantly - what I can do to work around this issue?  ",
