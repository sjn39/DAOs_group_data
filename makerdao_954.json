                    "content": "As this is my first post in the Maker community, I am Colin Cunningham from Centrifuge and I hope to be more visible and active moving forward. As many Maker community members know, we at Centrifuge have been working closely with @christiancdpetersen and other RWF CU team members to finalize the new legal structure for RWAs. We shared our key considerations both in a forum post and an AMA. Currently the indenture, which is the foundational legal document for the new structure, is in the final review stage after multiple reviews by both @christiancdpetersen and @elidco and our external counsel. This will not only help to safely grow current and future Pools to hundreds of millions on the Centrifuge protocol, but more importantly, that it is open sourced, reusable and adaptable by anyone in the Maker ecosystem. Now we are in the home stretch, and will continue to lean on @christiancdpetersen support to bring a final legal structure back to the Maker community and MKR holders for acceptance and approval. We are looking forward to publishing that next forum post! Given @christiancdpetersen recent review of the DST, we find it even more urgent to find a better solution together, and would like feedback from anybody objecting to @christiancdpetersen continued support of the Centrifuge legal process. Ultimately, our common goal is to make sure that this structure creates the legal safety net and sound foundation which Maker and Centrifuge (and others) require to scale the financing of RWAs into the billions. MIP65 was recently pulled from submission this voting cycle. We agree with many that MIP65c1 is particularly problematic. It creates an artificial prioritization queue based on an arbitrary quantitative projection of a $100M debt ceiling, which relies on the applicant\u2019s own projections. The Centrifuge RWA pipeline (more details below) - including already published MIP6s like Wintec - is in the scale of hundreds of millions. It looks like we all agree on where to go but are in disagreement on how to get there. Discussing priorities is important but we need to look broadly at MIP pipeline, qualitative and quantitative risk measures, legal structure, etc. to help RWA to scale in a sustainable and efficient manner. We have begun discussions with the RWF CU on several high-quality issuers. Here is a list of existing and upcoming Pools on Centrifuge, some of which have potential to scale past the $100M DC in the months ahead:  Precession Capital Management, led by Adam Young: They would be a great arranger for Maker. The team has years of successful structured credit experience and could start right away with at least 4 deals delivering more than $250M DC. Wintec (MIP6 here): a supply chain finance company in the semiconductor industry that has been in operation for 30 years, and has managed over $5B+ of supply chain assets over the last 15 years. They are audited by both their clients (OEMs in the Fortune 500) and a top 10 audit firm. https://www.wintecind.com/  RFA: a Canadian-owned mortgage finance company with over 25 years of Canadian real estate experience, seeking to launch an RMBS pool through DeFi. https://www.rfa.ca/about  FlowCarbon: a company dedicated to preserving the earth\u2019s natural carbon sinks by leveraging Web3 technology to finance and underwrite sustainability projects, and rapidly scale climate solutions. https://www.flowcarbon.com/  Community Investment Management (CIM): a global institutional impact investment manager which provides strategic debt funding to scale and demonstrate responsible innovation in lending to small businesses and underserved borrowers in the United States and emerging markets. They have $2B+ deployed across 23 fintech partners. https://cim-llc.com/  Intero Capital: a non-bank facilitator of traditional credit and decentralized (\u201cDeFi\u201d) working capital solutions for Governments and Commercial sector clients globally. The Intero team\u2019s expertise has led to the execution of $2B+ in working capital transactions to date. https://www.intero.capital/  Lendable: provides capital to emerging and frontier market fintech companies, with $200M+ deployed across 24 fintechs. https://lendable.io/  Flow Capital: Flow Capital is a publicly-listed capital provider to high-growth new economy companies (primarily tech and SaaS) via venture debt or revenue-based financing. https://flowcap.com/  Pool Overview: New Silver Series 2 | Tinlake | Centrifuge Pool Overview: ConsolFreight Series 4 | Tinlake | Centrifuge  ",
