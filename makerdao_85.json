Collaborating with Core-units across the DAO, SES plans to develop a network of content producers to build a more robust catalog of material that lowers the barrier of entry and welcomes outside contributors to support the protocol. We will discuss:  Cross-Core Unit Collaboration Enablement of Independent Contributors Upgrading SES Incubation Module Resources   @wouter will be presenting. Add the SES Status Update Call to your calendar  Other Updates  960\u00d7540 55.6 KB   Incubator News  960\u00d7540 58.7 KB   The TechOps Core Unit has 3 days left for ratification voting, with 87% of the vote in their favor.  Maker Talent presented this week on Core Unit Launch Pod Sessions, showcasing the incorporation of feedback provided on their MIP set (currently in RFC). MakerDAO SES has started the year with 3 new incubees. They are Maker Academy, Real-world Asset Compliance, and Real-World Asset Portfolio Incubator.   Maker Academy increases the proficiency of current/potential MakerDAO contributors and justifies the public adoption of MakerDAO\u2019s products by both facilitating the production of expert-curated content and creating it themselves. SES Grant recipient Colby Anderson @colby joins the SES Incubator as the facilitator of this proposed core unit.  Real-world Asset Compliance is the vision of Luca Prosperi @luca_pro, another SES Grant recipient and author of Project Real-world Sandbox. Luca joins the incubator to begin implementing his research, and will push the DAO to draft the Real-world Asset Manifesto. The Real-world Asset Portfolio Incubator is in the early stages of incubation, and will serve as the knoweldge center for bringing in the needed outside expertise of asset classes required to grow off chain collateral types.    The MakerDAO SES Incubation Program is also evolving, read more about V2 below   Project Focus  1280\u00d7720 343 KB  MakerDAO SES presented on our last Weekly Status Update call the 1st quarter Objectives and Key Results. Below is a summary of the initiatives and projects our team will be undertaking in the first quarter of this year.  960\u00d7540 40.8 KB  The first objective of 2022 is to restructure SES\u2019s Incubation & Grants programs. Both programs were very successful in their initial year, however the demands of the DAO are forcing these structured engagements to evolve. Incubation will be moving towards a \u201ccohort\u201d model, where we can increase the throughputs of participants by grouping them into similar tracks. Grants will soon be evolving into a bounty program. Instead of offering research and scholarship grants for anyone to self define their contribution, the program will evolve by placing rewards on delivering complete solutions to challenges and initiatives defined by SES.  960\u00d7540 39.3 KB  No spoilers here. Join our Weekly Status Update call to deep dive into this initiative.  Join us here! on 2021-01-21T15:30:00Z   960\u00d7540 32.9 KB  MakerDAO SES is merging two Q4 projects with our third objective of 2022. The Ecosystem Performance API & Dashboard will combine the research initiatives from Project X-ray with the goals from our DAO-wide Budget & Transparency improvement project. During the first quarter, our team will conduct stakeholder interviews to refine the vision for an Ecosystem Performance Dashboard, compile sources of the information, and work towards launching an MVP of the envisioned dashboard. Creating an accessible API is a major key result of this initiative to support access of the data by any interested party.  960\u00d7540 42.4 KB  MakerDAO SES Legal has a busy quarter planned. The primary key result the team is aiming to accomplish is the creation of the previously discussed Self-insurance Fund. This fund will mitigate legal risk for practical cases the DAO may face in the near future. Additional risk mitigation goals are defined as setting best-practices for Core Unit structures, and iterating on a MIP legal review process when ratifying proposals.  960\u00d7540 43.2 KB  The 5th objective MakerDAO SES has it\u2019s sights set on is the restructuring of the Real-world Asset core unit. Project Real-world Sandbox provided deep insight into positioning Dai and MakerDAO among other well established tradfi players. In order to support entering the market, many different competencies and processes must be developed across the DAO. As a first step, Luca Prosperi @luca_pro joins the SES Incubator as the facilitator of the Real-World Asset Compliance Core Unit. Project Real-world Sandbox\u2019s initial framework for evolving MakerDAO to support tradfi demands also includes the need of a Real-world Asset Legal, and Portfolio core units. Our key result of this objective is to incubate all three core units this quarter, positioning MakerDAO for a hot tradfi summer.

We will miss him and are excited to continue working with him in his new role!    Nikolaj joined Maker out of passion for crypto & blockchain tech. He said that work at the innovation lab at one of the largest fintech companies in Nordics was not hard on enough, so he joined Maker. Nikolaj has been a joy to work with providing technical expertise and structured, strategic support. He took initiatives in designing the incubation program and did lift a mountain of project management work with various incubee teams. Plus he is a nice person, great teammate and pleasant to be around. In one sentence, Nikolaj is an expert we will miss at SES. We are glad to see him stay in the Maker Ecosystem and look forward to collaborating with him in his new role at CES!    Huge thank you to @Lenkla from SES for coordinating the ENS Airdrop!    MakerDAO was named as a strategic partner and Lenkla took the initiative to coordinate the airdrop and direct the tokens to the Maker Protocol Pause Proxy. Maker received 46,296.30 ENS tokens (currently valued at over 2.5M DAI). Thank you!   Contacts  960\u00d7540 53.9 KB   Links  Discord Drive Notion   @ses-core-unit ",
