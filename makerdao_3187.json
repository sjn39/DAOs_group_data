I think this is a question for governance as to how risk adverse everyone wants to be. I think the proper protocol here would be to start some sort of signal request and then go from there.     flipflopflapdelegate:  And when you say seek insurance against any VaR breaches\u2014are you referring to institutional insurance, such as Lloyd\u2019s of London, or Nexus Mutual who did not get much traction from the Maker Community? Lloyd\u2019s would be an out of sight move!   I am mostly just suggesting this idea generally. I wouldn\u2019t really be qualified to speak to who might be an appropriate underwriter. I do think that the portfolio is large enough that some institutional insurance agency might be interested in the DAO as a client, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to say how best to set that up.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Also, can you expand on the idea of higher liquidation ratio Vaults? Business growth vs. Risk management   So there are kind of two questions here. But I\u2019ll post a graphic from the last presentation to kind of explain the thinking here. lr-ratios.PNG1068\u00d7481 97 KB The thinking behind high LR vaults would be to try and increase the area that would be shaded in green in the picture above. Basically it means that you would have more of a buffer before MKR holders start to incur losses. The question is what is the appetite for this sort of loan structure. IDK that there is a good answer to that, but I suppose that there might be some appetite so long as the SF was low enough. But more generally on the topic of \u201cbusiness growth vs risk management\u201d; you may look at those numbers and say this nominal risk is: ap101018123881-ca0472fba716df4b485fff878b558284cdc89ab92175\u00d71631 970 KB So this will leave you with a dilemma when it comes to topics like increasing DCs. Should you raise the DC and continue to raise the nominal VaR or do you decide you need to wait until your cash reserves are bolstered? Do you re-prioritize potential collateral applications to in order to only add collateral types that better diversify the portfolio? Do you consider charging for untapped revenue streams in order to more quickly bolster cash reserves? Lots of things to consider and they often come with trade-offs. ",

This might be true. It prevents us from dumping a ton of collateral on a distressed market which might cause further price displacement. On the other hand though it leaves you exposed in a sense as the price could continue to fall as you try and clear the auctions. There might be further work needed in that area. Likely there is some optimal setting here that we might be able to find. I\u2019d be really curious to know how the box might work with auctions 2.0.     g_dip:  Sorry if this was already discussed, but do your slippage estimates change with Dutch Auctions and flash loans (in the proposed liquidations 2.0 module)?   So again hard to say. I know @Primoz is really bullish on it and I think it does help in certain respects. So understand that the following is just based on my own views here. I think it will likely lead to less upward pressure on dai during the auctions, but the slippage model is currently ignoring that anyway. I think it also likely leads to more competition on these auctions, so it could affect how we think about modeling \u201ckeeper profit expectations.\u201d That said, the current slippage model is really trying to model two things keeper profit + how dumping x dollars worth of collateral on the market will affect the price. I don\u2019t really see how auctions 2.0 really has any effect on the later portion of the slippage. Assuming that keepers are still trying to immediately liquidate the purchased position for a profit they still have the opportunity to create  short term downward pressure even with auctions 2.0. So my guess is that it likely helps so long as you don\u2019t need to liquidate more than a few 10s of million worth of collateral, but after that you still are in a situation where the crypto market itself is too illiquid to actually purchase that amount of collateral at a reasonable price. But again that is just my take. ",
