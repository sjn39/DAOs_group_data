There are a number of alternatives, some of which are on mainnet today, that would fulfil the same goal. The EIP should also make it clear that Serenity is not inherently eth2 (i.e. the future of Ethereum), but rather a separate and Independent layer-1 that is planning to hard spoon the Ethereum state at a future time. And that the EIP suggests this new chain to be eth2, rather than starting from the assumption that Serenity is eth2. ",

The reason is that if fundamental flaws are discovered in sharding for whatever reason, it\u2019s always possible to instead just do the eth1 -> eth2 merge after phase 0. Phase 0 by itself is equally open to both of these future paths, so it\u2019s not strictly speaking a hard commitment to anything but PoS itself. And to be clear, the PoS part of eth2 is precisely the part that\u2019s gone through quite heavy analysis and review. The Medalla testnet has been running for ~6 weeks, of which 4 weeks have been nonstop without issue (that was the original release condition for the eth1 frontier launch), and will run for considerably longer before phase 0 mainnet. Basically the main remaining uncertainty in the PoS is the economics, which by definition cannot be tested except on a live value-bearing network in any case\u2026  The EIP should also make it clear that Serenity is not inherently eth2  Not sure what this is trying to say. Of course a proposed change to ethereum is not part of ethereum until it\u2019s actually fully implemented and rolled out; that\u2019s part of the definition of \u201cproposal\u201d. The fact that this particular proposal involves changing the ethereum system to temporarily be made up of two chains with one linking to the other (with a goal of later changing to yet another hub-and-spoke architecture of 64 shard chains that all link into a beacon chain) is a technical detail, not really any fundamental philosophical difference.

What is the purpose of real capital lockup on ETH1 during this period?  Why not just mint some new valueless toy token?  What do we gain by having real value here?  What happens to all of that locked ETH if something goes wrong during Phase 0?  If everything goes smoothly, will users gain any ETH or is it a zero sum game for the duration of Phase 0? The specific concern that was brought up is that if real capital is not necessary for this process, then we are entering dangerous territory where one might interpret the capital lockup as the purchase of a security (per US securities laws) since essentially you are \u201cinvesting\u201d in the future success of the ETH2 development team and will potentially profit if it is successful and lose if it is not (depending on answers to above questions). If real money is necessary for this process (can\u2019t just be some random minted token) or the game is zero sum, then I suspect the risks of that concern are lower than if this could be some toy token and the game has potential future yields.

When layer 2 is essentially just being tested but not actually providing value (yet) is when you get into the \u201cpromise of future value\u201d territory. I think the useful question to ask is, \u201cif all development stopped right now, would capital permanently locked in ETH2 be valuable/useful to people?\u201d If the answer is yes, then I think that there is a strong argument that the returns are not dependent on the actions of core developers/ETH2 researchers.  In the case of Serenity Phase 0, if we launched it and then all development on ETH2 stopped I believe that locked ETH would be totally worthless (effectively burned).  Thus, anyone depositing into that contract is \u201cinvesting in the success of the ETH2 development team\u201d. It is worth noting that I\u2019m not a citizen/resident of a country who cares about these things so I don\u2019t actually care about most of this stuff personally.

It leaves the stakers at the mercy of the Eth2 team, whose failure could then create a DAO-like dilemma for the Eth1 team. Further, as I discussed with @djrtwo on the PR,  I fear this is exactly the sort of thing that could make ETH look like a security to the SEC and similar authorities - we could pass the infamous Howey test that we have flunked so far.  It is an investment of money. There is an expectation of profits from the investment. The investment of money is in a common enterprise Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party.   I strongly urge your team to find a way to \u201ctest the economics\u201d without creating this risk and uncertainty.  If that is not possible I urge you to seek legal advice. So far as this EIP goes, I think risks can be avoided by careful editing to keep the proposal technically informative without making commitments. ",
