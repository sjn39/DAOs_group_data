                    "content": "Hey all, as most of you are aware, the October 23rd executive was passed using 13k flash-loaned MKR by the team at B.Protocol. See this post for details. The immediate danger of malicious governance attacks is in the process of being mitigated with by the new executive (increasing the GSM Pause Delay to 72 hours.) PLEASE VOTE if you haven\u2019t already. However, in addition to the problem of malicious governance attacks, we also have to figure out some method for dealing with a flash-loan being used in the manner that B.Protocol used one to pass the October 23rd executive. The problem statement is stated below: Actors can pass non-malicious governance proposals they have a vested interest in using the available flash-loan liquidity without owning MKR. Now, in the longer term, this issue will be resolved by the update the DssGov contract. In the short-medium term the Smart Contracts Domain Team are working on a fix as well. However, until that fix is implemented we will need to deal with this no-longer theoretical problem. Additionally, we need to attempt to come to some sort of consensus as what to do with regards to the October 23rd executive itself. B.Protocol have communicated that they did not have ill intent, however, the actual intent behind the action is irrelevant. The outcome of their actions is that a proposal has passed that was not agreed on by MKR Holders. The aim of this post is to prompt discussion and hopefully some movement towards a decision with regards to the above issues. What follows is a list of factors to consider.  1. B.Protocol admitted their actions and claims to have meant no ill-intent. As I hope most have seen elsewhere, @yaronvel admitted to their actions and has claimed to have no ill-intent. Additionally, the B.Protocol platform appears to benefit MKR Holders and the Maker Protocol by reducing the likelihood of liquidations at the protocol level. It is possible that @yaronvel is not dealing in good faith and just wanted to push the proposal through the executive vote once the possibility of failure became likely. Realistically it\u2019s difficult to judge another\u2019s intentions. 2. B.Protocol\u2019s actions were reckless and they appear to have given little thought to the consequences. I\u2019m not entirely sure what @yaronvel and others at B.Protocol were thinking when they did this. I can only assume it was the result of a lack of understanding in the Maker governance process and poor judgement or intentional action. If an actor wanted to showcase a vulnerability in the protocol (which Maker Governance were already aware of) then it makes exceeding little sense to showcase that vulnerability in a vote that directly benefits them, as exploiting that vulnerability throws the result of the vote into doubt, and leads to a post like this. It\u2019s this point that causes me to doubt B.Protocol\u2019s claims that showcasing the vulnerability was their driving motivation, though I am trying to keep in mind Hanlon\u2019s Razor. Also worth noting is that B.Protocol have consistently played off the impact of their actions as causing no harm. 3. Failing to react to flash-loans being used in this way invites further abuse of the vulnerability. Failing to react to B.Protocol using flash-loans in this way invites other parties to use them in the same manner. Namely, to pass proposals that benefit them without owning MKR and being exposed to the consequences. 4. Reacting too strongly to flash-loans being used in this way invites abuse in the opposite manner. If Maker Governance passes something draconic along the lines of \u2018Proposals passed using flash-loans are not valid and should be reversed\u2019 then this is open to abuse from actors that benefit from a certain proposal failing to pass. An actor could pass a proposal using the flash loan which should then be reverted based on the above statement.  I\u2019m sure there may be additional factors to consider. If you have any other thoughts, please leave them in the comments below and I\u2019ll add them to this post. In terms of the possible responses we could make, here\u2019s a non-exhaustive list of some ideas in order of severity. To be clear, I am not advocating for any of these, just listing suggestions. It goes without saying that these would need to be voted on before being implemented.  Do nothing Require a formal apology from B.Protocol for abusing MakerDAO\u2019s governance process. Revoke the \u2018first year free\u2019 for B.Protocol\u2019s oracle access and require them to pay for access effective immediately. Revoke B.Protocol\u2019s oracle access for a period of time. Revoke B.Protocol\u2019s oracle access permanently. A combination of the above.  Once again, if anyone has other ideas on how we should react to this issue, please share them below and I will add them to this list. ",

MKR holders were able to express their concerns before the executive. I already stated that I think that their action was legally legit. Nevertheless, they obviously wanted to have their proposal to pass in their interest (which might be the interest of Maker as well but this isn\u2019t relevant here). Is that a sound foundation for a business relationship? I don\u2019t think so. But mistakes and bad judgement happen. The response is not easy to define and depend on what we are expected to gain with the B.Protocol relationship, the alternatives, the PR impact, the personal relationships between them and us, and who they are (I would make them pay a bit if they are VC-backed but not if they are without funding for instance). I would suggest someone study all those aspects and propose something to the governance. I agree with all solutions. Obviously, the next business partner doing a flash loan in that way can expect more stronger consequences. This sets a precedent. ",

                    "content": "Hey, this is the founder of B.Protocol. I would like to give a three answer part. First I will present how B.Protocol helps MakerDAO community, and my personal history with MakerDAO. Then I will give some more details on our state of mind during the 23rd vote. And finally, based on that will argue my opinion on why severe steps would not benefit the MakerDAO ecosystem. B.Protocol contribution to MakerDAO B.Protocol makes lending platforms more stable, by providing clearer and quantifiable incentives to be a keeper. It is doing that by providing a smart contract interface that shares liquidation proceeds, in return to priority in the liquidation process. This way MakerDAO gets new and more committed liquidators, MakerDAO users get ETH rewards, and liquidators get more certainty, and avoid the gas wars. We went live almost a week ago, and currently over $2.5m of user funds were deposited, and over 1M dai was generated. We spent enormous amount of work bringing new keepers and guiding them through MakerDAO code so they could integrate. In addition, we have subsidized MakerDAO users with $10k in ETH that were seeded in the contract when going live. My history with MakerDAO While I was the CTO at Kyber Network, I led the first integration with Oasis DEX, long before it became the standard to aggregate liquidity. While designing the WBTC smart contract and its DAO, I helped MakerDAO to try an on-board more custodians. On black Thursday, I gave technical support, without any payment, to one of the keepers who almost single handedly saved MakerDAO that day. Hence, when founded B.Protocol, it was only natural to select MakerDAO as a first integration. The events of the 23rd A proposal to whitelist B.Protocol contract was put up to executive vote on the 23rd. On Sunday, the 25th, I started, for the first time, to dive deeper into the MakerDAO voting system, in order to understand the exact time it would be expected to pass. Already on that day I realized that a flash loan could help speed the process. I took a conscious decision to deploy the voting contract on that day, and to do it from the same account B.Protocol smart contracts were deployed. Fully knowing it could backfire on me, out of respect to the MakerDAO team, I decided not to play a cat and mouse game, and to do it with my own identity. Though I regret not disclosing it in a more responsible way, I am still mostly under the impression that without it, MakerDAO would have been less safe today. This issue was well known for months, and yet no action was taken. Proposed verdict Despite the above, I now realize that my actions led to an unfortunate turn of events. It forced MakerDAO to act urgently and spend effort on a mitigation, on the expense or working on other great features. Forced to by the governance or not, I do apologies (we already apologized at our social media), and will make it formal if instructed. As for the other options, the community should be aware that to date, MakerDAO is one of the most difficult projects to integrate with. Other than technical difficulties, the white-listing process delays all integrations by weeks. Integrating with over 60 projects at my time in Kyber, and integrating with other lending platforms, I could honestly say I believe that revoking access could just push away future projects from integrating with MakerDAO. In addition, personal sanctions in a decentralized world without identity can not play significant role towards preventing such actions from happening. I paid my respect for MakerDAO by not doing what I did under anonymous identity, and hope MakerDAO community will learn to understand the benefits of B.Protocol and the importance of keeping it operational.

I feel like this is a dangerous point of misunderstanding. A flash-loan doesn\u2019t just speed-up the process.

It feels like a massive and unnecessary own goal on your guys part. Something that was a purely good thing is now an issue that we need to give consideration to managing. The situation we\u2019re in is that flash loans were used to interfere with the governance of the protocol. How governance reacts to that is important, because despite it being a minor interference, it is the first known interference and how we react here will affect how we react to future votes including borrowed (flash loaned or not) MKR.

I personally don\u2019t see why using flash loans should be considered invalid but, e.g., voting anonymously with MKR obtained with illegal money would count as valid. It\u2019s the blockchain and we have to live in it. This is DeFi.     LongForWisdom:  I\u2019ve seen words of regret and claims that you meant no harm. Fine and good, but these aren\u2019t apologies in my eyes.   I am not sure anybody here is particularly interested in apologies, honest or not. I personally just care about improving the efficiency of the system. ",

My answer has mostly been:  There is a difference between someone passing their own proposal with borrowed MKR versus passing a proposal they favor with borrowed MKR. I view it more as a scale. The ideal is that someone owns MKR and is exposed to the potential fallout of their vote, the current system doesn\u2019t support this (no lockup.) If someone buys MKR for a short period then sells after voting that is less good. If someone borrows MKR to vote that is least good. The amounts involved also affect severity. Pushing something over the line with 100 MKR is less bad than pushing it over the line with 10,000 MKR.  ",

In fact if one considers the size of the markets now it only costs 513*50000=25.6M current to freeze ALL assets in the protocol by someone buying some amount of MKR (< 25.6M btw) and borrowing (can\u2019t be done with a flash loan) the rest to ES the system and profit from the chaos that would ensue in the markets. For varying reasons this attack is considered unlikely, but we approach now what 1.5B in assets.deposited this attack only needs to capture 2% of the total value of deposits to be profitable.   A significant difference from when the protocol only had perhaps 150-200M assets deposited.   This attack vector only needs 50K to execute, to actually try a governance attack roughly 100K would be needed.  Even then with the GSM delay the governance attack is still mitigated (somewhat) by the GSM.   Ask another question.  Why was this executive not halted within the GSM delay if there were concerns?  (I missed these discussions) So while B.Protocol probably didn\u2019t think through their actions in this regard.  I do not believe their actions to be malicous to the protocol even if they were aggressive in getting what they wanted passed. I would urge strongly that the actions of B.Protocol should be applauded because it will force the DAO to finally address these issues in a serious way.   DO NOT be deceived that the GSM does anything here with respect to the above ES attack scenario that still exists in the protocol TODAY. If MakerDAO wants to only allow actors with significant MKR to act in the system responsibly then adjust the protocol so that result is achieved. Right now someone can borrow MKR and do the same thing again.  The GSM delay does not stop voting attacks (if they can be considered such) only gives a pause before they can try to do anything of substance to the system.    My MKR seasoning proposal implemented on both the ES and DSSChief would.     MKR seasoning proposal for system control access       Greetings Maker community.  There is a lot going on and my apologies to add but I wanted to get this idea off my plate for risk-governance consideration as well as community consideration.  There has been a lot of discussion about attack vectors in the Maker system.  I have in my own analysis identified two primary attack vectors that I outline quickly below.    General governance attack via obtaining sufficient MKR.   The first line of defense for the MCD here that has been recently enacted is \u2026     What is a reasonable length of time to force a wallet to hold MKR before it can be deposited into DSSChief or the ES module??   And what are the pros and cons of having a seasoning check in all the MKR deposit points? Is it unreasonable to have as a constraint on depositing MKR into any of the MCD contracts a 7-14 day delay?   Do we want wild unseasoned (or flash loaned MKR) able to DO ANYTHING in the system?  Is 7-14 days enough of a seasoning period? These are the real questions to be asking and the real discussion to be having.  Not slapping on the wrist a company acting in good faith using the means that MakerDAO has made available to anyone including bad actors.   B.Protocol used the system as designed and implemented.   In the loosest sense they did NOTHING WRONG and simply acted against what would be considered rules of decorum and they didn\u2019t even try to disguise these actions. So my take.  DO NOTHING to B. Protocol here Fix the problem where it is broken.  ",

I think \u201crequiring\u201d them to post a formal apology is vapid, and the majority of the community would not back this. I think most of us follow the \u2018code is law\u2019 dogma. As far as I know (correct me) there was no official guidance that \u2018using flash loans to pass votes is discouraged.\u2019 And even if there were, a real malicious actor discards discouragement. As stated, using a flash loan to vote was a known issue. It probably wouldn\u2019t have been fixed before it was utilized. But now it\u2019s getting fixed, and that\u2019s great. I am glad that it was utilized for something trivial rather than something dangerous. As to why they did it? Advertisement, good press, helping to improve MKR protocol, being disruptive, who knows. I don\u2019t see any malice or stupidity in their actions ",
