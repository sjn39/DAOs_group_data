Wait, what? A new series? Aren\u2019t there, like, one million already? You suck! *  No. U. Also please bear in mind that MakerDAO is currently shifting to a new framework built around Core Units. This \u201cplethora\u201d of series aims to make it easier for everyone to manage and optimize their work in this new context. While Core Unit Tools focuses on useful third-party platforms, Core Unit Rituals focuses instead on best-practice organization and procedures.
