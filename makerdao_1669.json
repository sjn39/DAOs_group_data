                    "content": " Leveling up transparency and reducing information costs across the DAO    TL;DR  The SES Core Unit is excited to share with you the first release of the MakerDAO Ecosystem Performance Dashboard. This soft release, nicknamed Maker Expenses, is now available at https://expenses.makerdao.network/. This first release\u2026   Provides a clear overview of all the MakerDAO Core Units, their mandate, related MIPs, and practical info such as their social media profiles.   Enables all Core Unit Administrators to easily submit their monthly budget reports in a standardized format; these reports include Core Unit expenses and a rolling forecast for the next 3 months.   Allows Core Units and their auditors to easily access and review all monthly budget reports in one place.   SES will now work to onboard more Core Units until all are familiar with the process and make their budget data available on a monthly basis. > Read more about how to submit expenses for your Core Unit.  Future releases will build on this first version to present high-level financial summaries to key stakeholders such as MKR holders and delegates. We believe that easy access to this data is critical to better inform decision-making in the DAO. > Explore an early prototype of the data views enabled by the Core Units\u2019 budget reports. (Note that the data is still incomplete.) Read on to learn more about:  The key problems this release addresses; Onboarding more Core Units; A closer look at the Dashboard\u2019s features; Next steps.    Introduction The Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES) Core Unit\u2019s mission is to sustainably grow the Maker Protocol\u2019s moats by removing barriers between decentralized workforce, capital, and work. The Ecosystem Performance Dashboard & API objective follows this mission.  Screenshot 2022-06-09 at 17.00.471062\u00d7546 106 KB  The release we are announcing today is made possible by 3 core components: the Dashboard UI, the Budget Reporting Tool for Core Units, and the Ecosystem Performance API that provides access to the data.  The Dashboard UI  The first version of the Dashboard enables Core Units and their auditors to consult all submitted budget reports in one place and verify the correctness of the data. It is the primary focus of this update. The new release lays the foundation for more advanced analytics and summaries in the future. These will provide all stakeholders with easy access to the information they need to make informed decisions.  First version of the Dashboard1920\u00d71080 85 KB   The Budget Reporting Tool for Core Units  This reporting tool allows Core Units to push their data securely and conveniently to the API. The Budget Reporting Tool for Core Units launched in June, with the first early testers being DUX, GovComms, TechOps, Dai Foundation, Immunefi, and Events Core Units. We expect to onboard the remaining CUs in the coming weeks.  Budget tool reporting for Core Units1920\u00d71080 87.8 KB   The Ecosystem Performance API  This is the underlying component that makes all data available for consumption by the Dashboard and potential other ecosystem participants. We first introduced The Ecosystem Performance API in March. The API helps facilitate better automation of data collection and permissionless accessibility. As such, it broadens the impact by enabling additional 3rd party UIs, independent data analysis, and wider community adoption. > Explore the API here.    Why is the dashboard needed? With this first release of the dashboard, we lay the foundation for solving some of MakerDAO\u2019s most pressing problems.  Solving user problems1920\u00d71080 88.2 KB  Top problems that the Dashboard will mitigate Providing structured insights into Core Units\u2019 progress and financial wellbeing, reducing search costs & reporting efforts are just some of the core user problems we identified through our research.  Meme transparency reporting DAO1600\u00d7900 162 KB  Financial transparency reporting has recently been among the key discussion topics in the DAO  How MakerDAO Expenses expedite DAO transparency From the DAO stakeholder perspective, one of the top needs is to understand and review Core Unit finances easily. The Dashboard solves the challenge of information search costs by offering digestible insights about every Core Unit\u2019s finances. This is the first step towards enabling better decision-making and advancing the DAO\u2019s transparency. From the Core Units\u2019 perspective, the Budget Tool enables systematic and effortless communications of their Core Unit\u2019s financial information and presents it concisely in the Ecosystem Performance Dashboard. This allows them to become an early promoter of DAO transparency best practices. The Expenses Dashboard allows Core Units to show their financial health and set the record straight with easily digestible data - also putting an end to any inadequately founded budget conversations. We believe that enabling them to convey the information about their own CUs\u2019 finances and capital flows, instead of spending resources on communicating this across the DAO through various platforms, frees more time for important mandate-related work. We believe that bootstrapping the dashboard with the data from a handful of early users delivers value to the DAO in the shortest possible time\u2013it ensures basic CU information availability and supports financial reporting of CUs.   What\u2019s in the first release? MakerDAO Expenses Dashboard consists of information at 3 levels:   Homepage aka Core Unit index table: Easily find and compare all Core Units  The first dashboard view lets you browse the high-level overview of all active Core Units at MakerDAO. In this overview, you can glimpse some quick insights into MakerDAO\u2019s Core Units:  Core Unit names, shortcodes, and icons; Date the CU was voted in by governance; Actual expenditure with a budget cap overview for the latest 3 months of data provided; Team information like full-time equivalent and facilitator(s); Links to platforms where this Core Unit is active.      Preview of the Core Unit Table search function   Core Unit Landing page: Discover the most important aspects of individual Core Units  When clicking on a specific Core Unit, you will arrive at their landing page. This page\u2019s purpose is to give you a good picture of what the Core Unit is about and how it delivers value to the DAO. It also helps Core Units to convey the most important info in a standardized format.     Preview of DUX\u2019s Core Unit Landing page While the page header gives you an instant overview, the \u201cWhat we do\u201d section goes further into the CU\u2019s vision, mission and strategy. Understanding the size of the workforce and who the main contact is was frequently requested by the community. We\u2019ve included this team size and contact information as well. We have also provided information on how the Core Unit was established through the decentralized governance process by linking all active and related CU MIPs.   Core Unit Expenses page: Understand CU costs and how these costs change over time  You can navigate here from the Core Unit\u2019s landing page via the \u201cExpenses\u201d card featured on the right side. You will be greeted by the latest reported Actual Expenditure for the Core Unit. Supported views are monthly totals and breakdowns per CU wallet. In the Forecast tab, you will find the forecasted expenses for the upcoming periods side by side with the monthly budget and quarterly budget cap. When applicable, the MKR Vesting tab will give you insights into the team\u2019s vesting situation.     Preview of DAIF\u2019s Core Unit Expenses page  Other noteworthy dashboard aspects:    Responsiveness: We\u2019ve built the dashboard with flexibility in mind and optimized the frontend designs for the majority of desktop and mobile screens.    Mobile UX: The ability to access the website with a single click, directly from mobile is appreciated by many on the go.    Mobile UX1920\u00d71080 113 KB  Just add our Dashboard to the home screen of your mobile device, and you don\u2019t have to remember the URL, ever again.    Dark mode: We know that this feature is highly popular and especially desired by those spending a lot of their time on screen. We feel you.    Can you think of other data insights you would like to see? No problem. The advantage of the API first approach is that the insights do not have to be limited to the views the dashboard frontend offers. Alternatively, you can create your own views based on the API data that suits your needs. The API is intended as an open tool for the creation of other insights and UIs.  Tableau additional insights from API1920\u00d71080 104 KB  Here is an inspiration of the possible use cases for the June\u201922 data that our API has to offer. Explore the full Tableau workbook created by Jack here.   Next steps The analytics and reporting service for Core Units is just an entry point to the fully-fledged dashboard we will be rolling out over future iterations. In the immediate future, we will focus on:  Onboarding the rest of the Core Units; Ensuring that the data is complete, correct, and up to date; Incremental UX and other improvements based on user feedback.  Further down the road, we will be targeting a broader user base, adding more features, and advancing the Dashboard as the primary collaboration tool for DAO stakeholders.

                    "content": " What is the development and maintenance cost?     SelenaPotterIsASybil:  Looks great (except for the missing data) but how much did developing this dashboard cost (hours, DAI, w/e) and what\u2019s the ongoing maintenance cost?       SelenaPotterIsASybil:  @Lenkla\u2014what\u2019s your estimate for total cost (development and ongoing)?   It\u2019s definitely true that software development is always a significant investment. Depending on how it\u2019s calculated, the total cost of this project so far would range around $200k. This is from the initial needs analysis of the 3 components (budget tool, API and dashboard), until this release. It also contains a bit of work that is still in design phase and the initial setup of the development processes which always comes with some inefficiencies in the beginning. Running infrastructure costs so far are negligible (around $100/month). This may change if we want better availability guarantees, or if on-chain data were to enter the picture.  Why isn\u2019t all the data available yet?     SelenaPotterIsASybil:  this feels like a lot of money and effort was spent for little to no marginal improvement (especially given the incorrect / incomplete data referenced above).   As the opening post mentions, this first release is a soft release that will allow us to start on-boarding the remaining core units. We have anticipated that the dashboard will only be as valuable as the quality of its data. That\u2019s why we have focused on improving the monthly reporting cycle, making it easier for core units to report their expenses. We also offer support to help with the initial setup for those that aren\u2019t familiar with the process yet. However, we also understand that it\u2019s much more difficult to convince people to use a tool if there is no tangible output, which is why we have made the dashboard available first, and are now driving towards a complete data set that is checked for correctness.  Why don\u2019t we \u201csource the data from Github\u201d?     SelenaPotterIsASybil:  If the CUs are already reporting via GitHub and the SF team, why don\u2019t you source the data from GitHub instead of requiring the CU facilitator to report again each month with a custom node.js app? Or at least fill in missing data given the majority of core units don\u2019t have data in the current dashboard.   This has been explained in our status update about the budget tool. The core units that report on Github, basically submit a summary of their detailed financing spreadsheet in MarkDown format, as SES has originally recommended to set the expectation about budget transparency from the very beginning. So far, this has been a manual and quite tedious process. The Strategic Finance CU too, is doing a lot of manual work on a monthly basis to collect all the monthly budget information.  Screenshot 2022-06-09 at 14.4 2.031312\u00d7741 126 KB  No double work is required with the tool. Existing and new budget information can now easily be submitted by the core units themselves, with the budget tool that reads it directly from their detailed financing spreadsheet, automatically summarizes the info, and makes it available in the API. For Strategic Finance to include in their reports, to be made available on the dashboard, and for anyone else who want to analyze it. This is without messing around with MarkDown tables, copy/paste mistakes, or SFCU having to beg for their reports every month. The existing Github reports are an excellent reference to verify the correctness of the back-filled data.  Can\u2019t we just use a spreadsheet?     SelenaPotterIsASybil:  It seems like Maker could just use a spreadsheet or some DAO tooling software instead of custom dev work which is way more expensive in the long run\u2026   We started out with spreadsheets, are still using them where it makes sense, and we have evaluated a number of DAO tools as part of the prelimenary research. The question whether it\u2019s worth the cost to develop custom software is always a difficult one and it depends greatly on the ambition and strategy that we want to pursue. Our assumption is that MakerDAO still has the ambition to create an open, decentralized organization that actually works, whether it is with MetaDAOs or other mechanics. After witnessing months of painful governance drama, it has been our conclusion that \u201ctransparency with spreadsheets\u201d has failed miserably at MakerDAO. Our research has shown that stakeholders are at a total loss where to find even the simplest relevant information, even though everything seems to be available \u201con the forum\u201d somewhere. External observers find it impossible to understand what\u2019s happening at MakerDAO and core units are experiencing a complete deadlock due to uncertainty, a total lack of direction, and enough governance noise to make it nearly impossible to focus on delivering actual work. It clearly showed that the organization has an urgent need for better reporting, better coordination mechanisms, and above all, better tooling to support all this. We have verified this extensively with various stakeholders. With the first release of this dashboard we\u2019re making a potential start of what can be a decentralized operations platform for MakerDAO that actually works. So, yes, we have reason to believe that this is worth the effort.  Double standards?     SelenaPotterIsASybil:  It\u2019s telling that the core unit that is promoting project based budgeting also refuses to estimate cost for a recent project.   How exactly is this \u201ctelling\u201d? We are pushing for greater budget transparency, we are developing the software to make it happen. And indeed we are experiencing ourselves that it\u2019s not easy to determine the costs of projects given the structure of our current MIP40 budgets. This is in no way inconsistent. It just proves our point. ",
