This group includes the geth team. On the other hand, dapp stakeholders who depend on Ropsten stability did not the burden of dealing with a fork, and wanted a stable, enduring testnet for their users/testers. In this case it was the Raiden team. The key discussion between these groups happened here: https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5bb5c0b0ef4afc4f281795f2 ",
