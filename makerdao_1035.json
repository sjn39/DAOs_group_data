                    "content": "TL;DR: Retrieving the ~3.8k still claimable by the old Content Production multisig will not be included in an executive spell, due to the technical and ETH cost of doing so.  Update MKR voters recently passed this proposal for the dissolution of the Content Production Multi-Sig (you can view the thread here. One of the items within the proposal was the retrieval of nearly 3,800 DAI which the multisig can still claim from the Surplus Buffer. After chatting with members of the @Protocol-Engineering team, it was decided that this item will not be included in any upcoming spells. While fund retrieval from a wallet with a spending limit assigned to the Pause Proxy is fairly straightforward in situations where a multisig is locked (key lost or signer unavailable/unresponsive), the technical complexity when signers have full control over the multisig is much higher. While still possible to write a spell that seeks to retrieve these funds, it would be prohibitively gas expensive, as well as require a lot of technical labor. Given that the amount in question is quite small, the exercise of retrieving the funds would cost more resources than it would retrieve. This is a good reminder that while the spending limit required by all Governance-owned multisigs is beneficial, due to front running and potential griefing from a controlled multisig, it will rarely be a suitable option for an urgent retrieval of funds.  Follow-up I will like this post to the the thread for full transparency.
