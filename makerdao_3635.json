                    "content": " Pre-MIP Discussion: A Market Sentiment-Based Strategy to Burn MKR   Current Burn Situation As it stands, we currently target a 25% burn with lerp based on a recent community poll and executive vote. This target to burn MKR, in my opinion, is somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes the burn is on. Sometimes it\u2019s off. During pullbacks, we all scramble to decide whether we should restart the burn and by how much. Once the Surplus Buffer hits 60M, we\u2019ll again have to debate how to increase it while still burning MKR. The way we currently burn MKR is not efficient. The decisions we make are arbitrary, and these discussions eat away at the already limited cognitive bandwidths of our team members.  Dynamic MKR Burning Instead of manually adjusting our burn rates, turning them on and off when we feel like it (someone calls lerp), we can implement an automated burning strategy based on on-chain metrics and market sentiment.  Counter-Trading Market Sentiment  We can counter-trade market sentiment by looking at on-chain metrics, such as long and short interest. The best buying opportunities tend to be when short interest across the board piles up, not just on MKR, but on the entire market. Conversely, the worst times to buy are when the entire market is long. Effectively, without knowing the current price or any previous price action, we can identify:  Pullbacks worth buying when shorts have piled up. Levels to stop burning when longs have piled up.     On-Chain Metrics & Exchange Data  We have access to on-chain metrics and all exchange data for both CEXs and DEXs. From experience, there is reliable signal in counter-trading long and short interest. It\u2019s worth looking into all the data available and determine which of it is best suited for our needs.    Automated Burning Strategy  Vote on a target percent of the fees to be dedicated to MKR burning, and set that DAI aside.  Currently, we voted for 25%.   Read long and short contracts data from on-chain metrics and select exchanges.  We can discuss and vote on which data feeds we like.     Suggested Logic The logic I propose below is just a suggestion for how I believe we can implement a strategy to better optimize how we burn MKR:  For DAI that is set aside towards burning:  If long interest maxed out:   Burn: 0% of DAI   If long interest at 80%:   Burn: 5% of DAI   If long interest at 60%:   Burn: 10% of DAI   If long interest equals short interest:   Burn: 20% of DAI   If short interest at 60%:   Burn: 30% of DAI   If short interest at 70%:   Burn: 50% of DAI   If short interest at 80%:   Burn: 70% of DAI   If short interest maxed out:   Burn: 100% of DAI       Edit #1: We could also agree on a base burn rate to DCA at any price, maybe 5-10% of the allotment. As short interest piles up, the automation would crank the burn rate. Also, it\u2019s worth noting that this does not necessarily guarantee that we are burning at exact bottoms each and every time. Shorts are often right before they are wrong. Still, by cranking the burn when shorts pile up, we are increasing the likelihood that we are burning on pullbacks at lower, more optimal prices. The biggest downside, as I see it, is that we just burn less and retain more DAI in the SB, especially during a sustained run.   Edit #2 - In response to @flipflopflapdelegate: Governance would still have the authority to revoke the burn allotment to zero if we believe we are entering exceptionally bad times and want to wait for a \"bottom.\u201d Conversely, if we think times are good, we can vote to increase how much DAI we allocate to burn by automation. The idea though is that we all suck at timing markets and that a strategy like this takes the guesswork out of it. You probably want to burn when times are bad because the price is likely depressed and you\u2019ll never know when the \u201cbad times\u201d end.    Discussion The exact implementation for this should be open to discussion. Someone willing would have to build this, but I believe the time and energy spent would be worthwhile. Not only will we optimize our MKR burn, but we will also reduce unnecessary cognitive overload on governance in the future.  There could be some linear or logarithmic interpolation for how much we burn and at what levels. We can vote on how much we would like to burn in general. We can vote on which data feeds we trust the most. We can run backtests on variations of this strategy and compare them against our past burn performance.   Note: The general idea for this counter-trading strategy comes courtesy of @TomDeMichele. He and his team have worked to develop a custom trading indicator. They would be more than happy to work with us to develop a strategy to counter-trade market sentiment to burn MKR.

That said, currently MakerDAO buys and burns MKR when the surplus buffer is overflowing, but mints and sells MKR when it is depleted. An interesting adjustment to this process would be to curtail some of those buy and burns (in \u201cgood times\u201d) and store those funds for use in slowing down minting and selling (during \u201ctough times\u201d). If it turns out to be true that in the long term MKR prices are cheaper during \u201ctough times\u201d and more expensive during \u201cgood times\u201d then the protocol comes out ahead. ",

Then to @flipflopflapdelegate \u2019s point it would be pretty easy to turn it off if we\u2019re worried about dropping revenue. The best thing about this idea is it allows us to burn based on price action. Currently we only get to burn until someone calls lerp. This means we can easily be burning while the price is high and stacking the SB when it\u2019s low. The part of this idea that excites me was as a defense against short interest driving down MKR price. The cheaper MKR is, the less expensive a governance attack is. Plus shorting inherently involves borrowing, which already puts us at risk. If we use this mechanism we help prevent an attack that relies on borrowing more MKR as the price drops. The only question is how easy would this be to implement. But the best thing is risk wise it only toggles the burning amount, which we already do with lerp! ",

Sometimes it goes down, especially after sharp rises, and that\u2019s  completely healthy. Shorts pile up on pullbacks, and that\u2019s when we would ramp up burning. This strategy would blunt MKR\u2019s downside and we would be buying the dip every time. This is basically a strategy to buy fear, typically the best buying opportunities. We can identify fear by proxy, short interest. Generally, it peaks when the market is most afraid. It doesn\u2019t means we buy and burn at the exact bottom every time, but it\u2019s better than micromanaging when we do burn. We remove the human element of turning burning on or off.

This would solve for arbitrariness and \u201cpoor timing,\u201d among other things.

I think short interest is interesting, but only a derivative metric of PE which is what we should really be targeting.

I think the first step to having an automated burning strategy is to first discuss and implement an automated Surplus Buffer strategy. I would strongly recommend we listen to the experts in the @Risk-Core-Unit on what is appropriate and how we could calculate based on changes in our collateral pool. Let\u2019s not forget we\u2019re in the midst of onboarding a number of CUs and will have to pay them out of the Surplus Buffer. Even if we only consider the CUs that have been proposed today our annual DAI expenses exceed the current Surplus Buffer. Yes, the forward annualized revenue we\u2019re generating far exceeds this number, but we fell from ~17.5M annualized income in August 2019 to <10K in August 2020 and are in a bull market where dog named tokens with a multi-trillion coin supplies are being aped into. We need to have enough funds to cover our risk-weighted assets and DAI CU expenses, this should be our priority. ",

This    I can\u2019t help but think that when growth opportunities become poor and when companies have excess capital they should hold-on to Cash (DAI). Is the Surplus Buffer at a stage where one can say it is sufficient to outpace volatile Market conditions, or it has the ability to survive a slowdown in growth opportunities? The last thing we want to do is to ask Core Units to cut down on Staff because we don\u2019t have enough of a healthy Surplus Buffer. ",
