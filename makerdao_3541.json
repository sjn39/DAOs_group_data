Could I have any suggestions from the Maker community? While it is important for them to get them an actual bank account, our group would like to help them leapfrog into DeFi where they can: 1.) get better rates for keeping their tokens staked (similar to yEarn/Celsius). 2.) Get access to better loans from DeFi platforms 3.) Build credit I\u2019m thinking about designing a system where a company has a bank account to serve their users and uses the collective company assets in that bank account to create a stablecoin. This company would have to burn/mint tokens to keep the ratio of tokens/cash the same at the end of the week/month. I\u2019m not sure it needs to be algorithmically managed, though I\u2019m not opposed to it being built like a MKR/DAI approach, but I do not want to build it on Ether, I want to build it on Avalanche (AVAX). I\u2019m Nathan Windsor, CEO fo Volta Inc, we\u2019re building products in the DeFi space, I\u2019d be glad to chat. Thank you Nathan ",

To answer your question, it seems like the key is in developing cash on/off-ramps that use the existing savings infrastructure. It\u2019s not easy to do as you have certain technological limitations to overcome, but I think this could be our next big market. You should also speak with the Growth Core Unit to see if there\u2019s a way to align initiatives. ",

Interestingly, your ideas will probably apply to a few other countries too, where the government wants to try and enforce similar bans. ",

There\u2019s not much stopping you from taking their cash and running away and legal recourse is not available precisely because your service is designed to circumvent a law. I\u2019m gonna assume you mean you\u2019ll send DAI to your customers in return for cash in this paragaph. Here, it wasn\u2019t clear if cash \u2192 crypto is also banned yet but if not, there\u2019s no reason to use your company to buy crypto. You\u2019d just be providing them a service to sell DAI and get cash. If you can achieve this, it\u2019s pretty neat. I imagine you\u2019d have an overseas account that sells DAI for cash and then uses traditional banking to transfer that cash into a Nigerian account. Of course, if the government does ban cash \u2192 crypto as well, then your service would work in reverse too. ",
