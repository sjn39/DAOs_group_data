The DexGuru platform provides on-chain analytics, a swap tool, multiple chains, and DEXs, leaving a lot to grasp for any level trader. Put simply, DexGuru offers data. We work hard to gather all relevant on-chain data to present it to DexGuru users in a helpful and efficient way. Data is collected from eight EVM compatible chains so DeFi traders on Optimism, Avalanche, Ethereum, Arbitrum, and others can enjoy the same trading experience when analyzing their favorite tokens. We monitor many unique DEXs and their pools for liquidity changes, trades, and price movements. With our primary focus on building in the open, DexGuru provides an instant API with the most reliable on-chain market data for Ethereum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum, Celo, and Avalanche blockchains. Developers can use the API to find information about tokens\u2019 prices, trading pairs, traders, AMMs, on-chain transactions, etc.  image1131\u00d71126 200 KB   Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):  DexGuru is governed by GuruDAO, which is at the moment at the pre-DAO stage and looking forward to TGE of $GURU token. How will the OP tokens be distributed? 100% GuruDAO grants for the community GuruDAO encourages contributors to create new tools and protocols within the GuruDAO ecosystem and would like to provide grants to the most prominent proposals that will be beneficial to DexGuru and Optimism. Our grant program will be based on supporting projects are using our Public API. DexGuru provides API for developers with reliable on-chain market data for Ethereum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, and other chains about tokens\u2019 prices, trading pairs, traders, AMMs, on-chain transactions, etc. Full support of the Optimism chain will be a requirement for such projects. Since we are providing multichain capabilities, it won\u2019t be tied just specifically to Optimism and may support other chains as well. We had previous experience with the hackathon event during ETHDenver2022 and went very well - as a team, we distributed several grants to projects (more info can be found in our blog). Decisions on grant distribution will be under GuruDAO control and go through the general governance process ( GuruDAO Bootstrap Phase proposal: [PROPOSAL] Governance process (snapshot.org)) We open to include an OP representative in the GuruDAO multisig. But it will be up to GuruDAO voting though. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? The goals of DexGuru and GuruDAO are to provide the most relevant on-chain data and analytics along with the education for users on how to make meaningful trading decisions. The growth of our user base encourages new and existing DeFi users to advance and become well-informed, letting them use Optimism comfortably and bring more liquidity to the protocol. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Building the product and growing the DexGuru user base provides a long-lasting effect on protocol usage. More experienced traders well-equipped with advanced analytics extend the market and make it more sustainable in the long term perspective. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? The incentive period will be between 6-12 months. How much will your project match in co-incentives? GuruDAO is still in a pre-DAO stage and the $GURU token is not yet issued. $GURU token may be added upon a decision from GuruDAO . ",

I can list AT LEAST 50 people who have been blocked/banned for no apparent reason!!! (for Optimism team, not you, cause you will find their wallet and it is not good for that blocked members)   You get a huge percentage of that budget for yourself!!!, can say about 70%, because your marketing and conferences do not have a large audience and practically very very very few attend\u2026 And of course that few participants in your events are because of your upcoming airdrop, otherwise you are much worse than Paraswap.   The Optimism team can give the budget to real projects that treat their community well, projects that don\u2019t see just their own pockets, but really care about the other projects, decentralization and web3.0 world.   Honestly, These words do not come from personal enmity, I just care about Optimism and don\u2019t like them to spend their tokens for bad projects.

The DexGuru platform provides on-chain analytics, a swap tool, multiple chains, and DEXs, leaving a lot to grasp for any level trader. Put simply, DexGuru offers data. We work hard to gather all relevant on-chain data to present it to DexGuru users in a helpful and efficient way. Data is collected from eight EVM compatible chains so DeFi traders on Optimism, Avalanche, Ethereum, Arbitrum, and others can enjoy the same trading experience when analyzing their favorite tokens. We monitor many unique DEXs and their pools for liquidity changes, trades, and price movements. With our primary focus on building in the open, DexGuru provides an instant API with the most reliable on-chain market data for Ethereum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum, Celo, and Avalanche blockchains. Developers can use the API to find information about tokens\u2019 prices, trading pairs, traders, AMMs, on-chain transactions, etc.  Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): DexGuru is governed by GuruDAO, which is at the moment at the pre-DAO stage and looking forward to TGE of $GURU token. How will the OP tokens be distributed?  50% to the DexGuru team (A.K.A Dev Sub-DAO)  Dev sub-DAO\u2019s primary focus is building the DexGuru platform and is responsible for GuruDAO technical maintenance (ratified by GuruDAO Dev Sub-DAO Initiation proposal). The team is dedicated to product and GuruDAO development within its boundaries. The OP tokens distributed to the Dev Sub-DAO will be used for development process funding, paying salaries to developers, and team extension. The team has a long backlog of analytical features and additional funding helps in speeding up the rolling out.   30% GuruDAO grants for the community  GuruDAO encourages contributors to create new tools and protocols within the GuruDAO ecosystem and would like to provide grants to the most prominent proposals that will be beneficial to DexGuru and Optimism.   20% Marketing activities  Meetups, webinars, conferences, and media publications on topics associated with Optimism protocol and DexGuru.    How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? The goals of DexGuru and GuruDAO are to provide the most relevant on-chain data and analytics along with the education for users on how to make meaningful trading decisions. The growth of our user base encourages new and existing DeFi users to advance and become well-informed, letting them use Optimism comfortably and bring more liquidity to the protocol. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Building the product and growing the DexGuru user base provides a long-lasting effect on protocol usage. More experienced traders well-equipped with advanced analytics extend the market and make it more sustainable in the long term perspective. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? The incentive period will be between 6-12 months. How much will your project match in co-incentives? GuruDAO is still in a pre-DAO stage and the $GURU token is not yet issued. $GURU token may be added upon a decision from GuruDAO .   \u795d\u798fDexGuru\u987a\u5229\u53d1\u5c55 ",

If you have not seen the proposal to remove airdrop farmers, please read it here:   Thanks to everyone in the community that have identified airdrop farmers and shared them in the Discord or with me...  Reading time: 11 mins \ud83d\udd51 Likes: 234 \u2764        all of these evidence neglected by dex guru team and they don\u2019t co-operate to fight these accounts, most of us know how rotate.eth played a major role in sybil hunts of Hop Protocol. so this GuruDAO grant doesn\u2019t mean jackshit before we find out who the hell gonna make it into it, will Dex.Guru team fight these airdrop hunters? because we sure as hell don\u2019t want free OP token in hands of these people. the neglect from Dex Guru team is to the point that some of us think there\u2019s an insider stuff going on here and they have a total dictatorship in their Discord server and all of the discussions about removing airdrop farmer gets shut down by their team as \u201cairdrop talk\u201d. 20% marketing activities, give me a freaking break invangbi from LobsterDAO almost fell sleep halfway during your Twitter Space because of how boring the host is and it feels more like a job interview than a AMA or whatever the hell you call it. so in conclusion Dex Guru team wants 100% of that grant to themselves. the only grant i would give them is hiring an actual UI designer to change that hideous interface, shit reminds me of yahoo messenger.

Since we are providing multichain capabilities, it won\u2019t be tied just specifically to Optimism and may support other chains as well.   Regarding the second question - as for now GuruDAO doesn\u2019t have its token yet. We expect TGE this August / September depending on market conditions. After TGE we will initiate community discussions but the final decision will be up to GuruDAO voting. ",

I am not sure how the allocation helps optimism. Reading the proposal, you intend to provide 100% of it to your community in the form of grants? How does that help the Optimism ecosystem? Since you are not a DAO yet \u2026 who is actually your community and who decides where these tokens would go to? As my co-delegates noticed It seems that the $OP will go to projects building on other chains including Optimism. This seems like a mismatch of incentives for us. A proposal more tailored to Optimism would make more sense. For co-incentives since you are not a DAO yet and you mentioned you will be one soon would it not make sense to revisit this proposal after you have launched?  ",
