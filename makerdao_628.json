                    "content": "1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? This collateral onboarding application is being submitted by the NFTX DAO in collaboration with the Maker Growth Core Unit. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Overview NFTX is a platform for creating liquid markets for illiquid Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). NFTX\u2019s mission is to become the primary provider of liquidity for floor NFT collections, allowing anyone to buy, sell or invest in NFT markets without needing the underlying knowledge and expertise required when investing in individual assets. By doing so, NFTX will function as a black hole for NFT assets. This has the effect of financializing NFTs as an asset class, unlocking novel use cases and increasing their composability into DeFi. How it works Users deposit their NFT into an NFTX vault and mint a fungible ERC20 token (vToken) that represents a claim on a random asset from within the vault. vTokens can also be used to redeem a specific NFT from a vault, creating arbitrage opportunities. This has the effect of strengthening the accuracy of the floor price of a collection. All ERC20 vTokens are backed 1:1 with NFTs within the vault. When a new NFT is added to the vault, another ERC20 token is minted. When someone buys/redeems a NFT from the vault, one of the ERC20 vTokens is burned. This MIP6 application is for $PUNK to be supported as a collateral type. $PUNK is the fungible ERC20 token (vToken) for the CryptoPunks by Larva Labs collection. We propose using $PUNK as a way to pilot NFT support in MakerDAO\u2019s ecosystem for the following reasons:  CryptoPunks have established longevity and name recognition as a premier NFT collection CryptoPunks are permissionless crypto native assets, reducing trust assumptions such as custody risk or actions by a DAO or organization adversely affecting their value As an asset that conforms to the ERC20 standard, integration into the Maker Protocol is well-defined and presents no technical blockers while reducing risk presented by protocol changes needed to support other asset types. The Floor Market Cap of CryptoPunks is attractive, totalling $1,777,950,000 at the time of writing. Secondary market liquidity is relatively large, supporting efficient liquidation by keepers in the case of a CDP falling below the safe collateralization ratio.  The timing is appropriate as the vaults activity will be bolstered by two supporting initiatives: Inventory Staking (commonly referred to as Single-Sided Staking)  This feature, launched on January 20th, 2022, allows NFT inventory to be deposited into NFTX vaults to earn yield without the traditional risks associated with liquidity providing. This feature will draw currently idle Floor Punks into the NFTX ecosystem, deepening CryptoPunk vault liquidity. More information on the feature can be found in our blog post, Introducing NFTX Inventory Staking.  FloorDAO  FloorDAO\u2019s mission is to bring NFTs into the mainstream by providing instant and deep liquidity to blue-chip NFTs. This has the effect of deepening available liquidity and further establishing reliable floor prices. FloorDAO works by leveraging the bonding mechanism of Olympus and the decentralized market making of NFTX to create a community owned product that sweeps floor NFTs. FloorDAO will launch focused uniquely on the CryptoPunk vault, increasing both the available liquidity and visibility of the $PUNK token. More information on the project can be found on the FloorDAO Blog.  3. Provide a brief history of the project. Founded in January 2021, NFTX was designed as a platform for making ERC20 tokens that are backed by NFT collectibles. These tokens, like all ERC20s, are fungible and composable. As the popularity of NFTs exploded, the mission of the project evolved to have a larger and more topical impact: becoming the primary provider of liquidity for NFT collections. Achieving this mission allows anyone to buy, sell or invest in NFT markets without needing the underlying knowledge and expertise required when investing in individual assets. It also unlocks NFTX vTokens to be used as composable money legos in the broader DeFi ecosystem. As of today NFTX is the leader in instantly available NFT liquidity with more than $30,000,000 locked across 150+ NFT vaults. 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.  Docs Source Code Academy PUNK Token Dune Analytics  5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. Two audits from Code Arena have been completed:   Findings. Summer 2021  Findings. Winter 2021  XIP#13 passed, in late December of 2021, clearing a budget for an additional protocol audit with Trail of Bits (scheduled for Q2 of 2022). 6. Link to any active communities relating to your project. NFTX has an active community of over 45,000 members across multiple channels.  Discord Twitter Blog Forum  7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? The $PUNK token is currently used in the following ways:  Generating yield through staking and LPing Instant liquidity for sales and purchases via SushiSwap An accessible way for investors to get price exposure to CryptoPunks  8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? There is no legal organization. NFTX operates as an AragonDAO powered by a decentralized governance structure. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? $PUNK tokens are available to trade on Sushiswap and Poloniex. They can also be redeemed for the underlying NFT using the NFTX vault and sold on secondary marketplaces such as OpenSea. 10. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. No legal opinions or memoranda obtained. 11. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. N/A 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. We have a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) bot that provides a price feed for $PUNK 13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. N/A ",

                    "content": "Thank you for the application! In general, I believe integrating NFTs into DeFi is an exciting development, that we should definitely explore further. My response will be focused on the specific collateral asset of this application. At CES we\u2019re currently trying to establish benchmarks for what is considered \u201cgood\u201d collateral to be onboarded, in terms of potential for Dai generation, liquidity, risk, revenue, and cost. Soon we\u2019ll be able to share more details of what these benchmarks are which would make it clear to collateral applicants on what to expect, and what the priorities are in terms of collateral onboarding. I\u2019ll try to share some preliminary thoughts in the following. Due to the development costs and maintenance costs of onboarding and operating a collateral type, a collateral type must be able to generate at least 500k-1 M a year in stability fees (depending on the complexity of the collateral) to break even. In your \u201cbull scenario\u201d we only barely reach this amount of Dai. This would, based on your numbers, mean 25-30 M Dai generated. To safely support this amount you would need deep enough liquidity on dexes/DeFi to be able to safely liquidate a large chunk of that amount in a short time span. However, on top of this is an even greater cost, which is the opportunity cost, of not pursuing onboarding another collateral type that might have larger Dai generation potential, that does not just break even. Therefore I would personally say that any collateral that does not have the potential to realistically generate at least 100 M Dai (1 % increase of total supply currently), in the future, should not be prioritised in the near term unless there\u2019s a really strong strategic benefit. So my questions are:  Are there any compelling business case (e.g. the GUNIDAIUSDC vaults enabled attractive yield on stable pairs through leverage) or commitment from NFTX that would ensure that at least 30 M Dai would be generated from such a vault? Are there any yield generating strategies of utilizing the vault, and how much yield is it expected to generate? How do you see the number of Dai generated increase to 100 M in the future? What is the strategic benefit of onboarding this vault for MakerDAO? Can you provide any data on onchain liquidity of PUNK? Would it be able to sufficiently support a market crash where the Maker Protocol would need to liquidate 30 M worth of PUNK without causing too much slippage? Are there any other price sources than SushiSwap and Poloniex? Are you planning any other exchange listings? To support a robust price feed, we must be able to pull data from 5-6 seperate sources with adequate liquidity and volume. It looks like there are permissioned functions to upgrade and manage the token - what are these functions, who can call them, and when?  ",

I think the path forward for this collateral will probably require some creative approaches to price feeds, which could help reduce cost while addressing some of the issues listed above:     lollike:  Are there any other price sources than SushiSwap and Poloniex? Are you planning any other exchange listings? To support a robust price feed, we must be able to pull data from 5-6 seperate sources with adequate liquidity and volume.   Maybe just using Sushiswap TWAP could work, as long as profit potential from oracle manipulation is lower than cost. This would require some research to see if it\u2019s possible to do this safely (what\u2019s the maximum safe ratio of debt ceiling to AMM liquidity, what is optimal length of time to use for TWAP, etc). If we just use Sushiswap TWAP our costs will be lower (allowing us to break even at a relatively lower DAI minting threshold) and lack of CEX listings would no longer be a blocker. Another idea is to use the \u201cfloor price\u201d (lowest offered price for a punk NFT on the cryptopunks marketplace) as an additional data source to provide an upper bound on oracle price, which would help defend against pump and dump attacks. That said, launching a vault with novel price feed mechanism could increase risk and development costs significantly. Instead of directly onboarding PUNK tokens as collateral, Maker could also consider setting up a D3M type mechanism to provide liquidity into lending pools (eg on Rari Capital Fuse in the existing NFTX pool, or even a newly created pool managed by MakerDAO). This externalizes the oracle costs to the lending market (allowing Maker to break even more easily), but likely involves some of the oracle security compromises mentioned above. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the comments, @lollike. It would be very interesting to understand the benchmarks used so that we can make sure to fulfill the criteria. Looking forward to reviewing them when they are made available publicly. In terms of opportunity costs, $PUNK can be seen as the entry point to supporting NFTs as a whole in Maker\u2019s protocol. Meaning that the 25-30m generated by $PUNK is the tip of the iceberg, with magnitudes higher amounts of capital being folded in to Maker once $PUNK integration is a proven success. By starting this process early, Maker will be well positioned to continuously onboard emerging NFT collections and position themselves as the go-to provider of capital for NFT holders looking to use their assets as collateral. To answer your questions: Are there any compelling business case (e.g. the GUNIDAIUSDC vaults enabled attractive yield on stable pairs through leverage) or commitment from NFTX that would ensure that at least 30 M Dai would be generated from such a vault? Are there any yield generating strategies of utilizing the vault, and how much yield is it expected to generate? I don\u2019t understand the question. Can you rephrase? How do you see the number of Dai generated increase to 100 M in the future? Supporting $PUNK as a collateral type is the entry point to supporting other NFT collections in the future. In aggregate, the NFT industry can be estimated at greater than $20,000,000,000. There is also the opportunity to expand outside of supporting only Floor Punks by using floor price as a basis to value other traits. i.e. Hoodie Punks are valued at 4 times the floor price. This increases the total addressable market from around 15% of existing Crypto Punks (the number of Floor Punks) to greater than 98% (excluding all aliens, monkeys and zombies). What is the strategic benefit of onboarding this vault for MakerDAO? Onboarding this vault is a signal of MakerDAO\u2019s support for NFTs as an asset class. This comes with a first movers advantage, and creates a moat against emerging lending protocols who will be supporting NFTs as a collateral type. These include Genesis, jpeg\u2019d, PawnFi, NFT Fi, Drop Loans, Arcade and Trust NFT. This allows Maker to capture value as the industry grows and ensures that competitors do not fill the vacuum in Maker\u2019s lieu. Short term, the NFT industry is generating a lot of press, with loans using NFTs as collateral the subject of a Fortune article this week. This presents an opportunity for exposure to the MakerDAO brand and exposure to a wider audience. Can you provide any data on onchain liquidity of PUNK? Would it be able to sufficiently support a market crash where the Maker Protocol would need to liquidate 30 M worth of PUNK without causing too much slippage? This is a key consideration, and at this point, there would be significant slippage. The solution here is to deepen liquidity. We are working on doing this through FloorDAO. It\u2019s important to note that $PUNK can also be redeemed for the underlying NFT and then sold at  market (OpenSea, LL, LooksRare). This is another source of liquidity and can act as a backstop to the liquidity available for $PUNK. Are there any other price sources than SushiSwap and Poloniex? Are you planning any other exchange listings? To support a robust price feed, we must be able to pull data from 5-6 seperate sources with adequate liquidity and volume. I will defer to @monet-supply\u2019s  answer. However, we are pursuing exchange listings as part of our business development priorities for 2022. It looks like there are permissioned functions to upgrade and manage the token - what are these functions, who can call them, and when? Summoning @gaus to answer this question! ",

In terms of the permissioned functions @lollike\u2014NFTX uses upgradeable proxies for most of our contracts. The address which is in charge of upgrading (ie. proxy admin) is the NFTX Dao on Aragon. And any proposals on Aragon require 80% relative support, which means that the team (which holds less than 20% of circulating NFTX tokens) is unable to push through proposals without community having the ability to veto them. Currently the voting time for proposals is only 24 hours, but we plan to increase to 72 hours in the near future, and continue increasing every 6 months or so as the protocol matures more. ",

I would also reference monet-supply\u2019s excellent breakdown here .   Is NFT price floor really a good way to define the market size of a collection? As a counterexample, it is trivial to generate an NFT collection with price floor 1k ETH and real market size 0. As monet-supply points out in his breakdown, \u201cEven for floor assets from top sets, liquidity is potentially vulnerable to manipulation.\u201d Further still, price floor is a way to reason about NFT market size, not the market size of a token associated with one or more NFT collections. If I\u2019m not mistaken this proposal is for $PUNK, not any NFT\u2019s, so NFT floor price seems even less relevant. Back to considering NFT collateral, illiquidity compared to fungible assets would seem to make liquidations a nightmare. At time of writing BAYC has 9 sales in the last day, CryptoPunks has 1. That doesn\u2019t seem like an acceptable amount of time to wait for a liquidation to execute. I suppose this might be mitigated by liquidating at a steep discount, 15+% below floor price. Since the liquidated NFT might well be the only one sold that day, this may cause cascading liquidations on other NFT collateralized vaults. As others have already mentioned, supporting NFT\u2019s would require massive work from the risk and dev angles. ",

Are there any yield generating strategies of utilizing the vault, and how much yield is it expected to generate? I don\u2019t understand the question. Can you rephrase?

And in that case, what kind of user is this, and what is the value for them in using the vault? For example, will this feature be integrated directly into NFTX such that any PUNK holder can easily take out a loan in Dai? And if so, how will it be marketed? The reason I\u2019m asking is because in the past we\u2019ve onboarded +1B market cap blue chip DeFi tokens, that saw very little use, and was subsequently offboarded leading to a net loss for MakerDAO. Therefore, we need to understand in more detail what is the business case for using the vault:  Who is the average user? Is it individuals with crypto holdings of 50-100k, or will it be organizations, DAOs, institutions with large NFT holdings? Why are they using the vault? Are they using it for leverage to reinvest in NFTs? Is it to get liquidity from an otherwise illiquid asset? Is it to farm with stablecoins? How will they be using the vault? Will they use existing user interfaces, or will NFTX provide an integrated solution for its user base?  With this in mind, I\u2019m looking for compelling arguments that there will be enough usage of the vault such that about 100 M in assets will be locked in the Maker Protocol, and 30 M Dai generated.

For individuals, interfacing with the Maker Vault will be similar to managing the rest of their assets. This can be done through the NFTX app and also through UX focused products. Think Zerion, InstaDapp, Argent, DeFi Saver. A \u201cget a loan\u201d option powered by Maker would slot in nicely here. For organizations, we can imagine this as an enterprise level tool to support managing treasuries. Using the NFTX DAO as an example, we currently hold a large portion of our treasury in vTokens. This allows us to use single-sided staking to earn risk-free passive income. However, when the treasury needs liquidity we are forced to sell the underlying NFTs. Using Maker Vaults gives us the option to hold on to these assets and instead use them as collateral to create liquidity to fuel our operations. As another example, we can look at FlamingoDAO and their treasury of 200+ CryptoPunks. These assets are very valuable but lack composability. A Maker Vault unlocks these assets to be used to support organizational investment theses. For example, Flamingo can use their Punks as collateral in a vault to buy more Punks. This has the effect of removing Punks from supply, driving up their price, increasing the value of Flamingo\u2019s treasury. This flywheels, allowing them to continuously leverage their growing treasury to more aggressively pursue their investment thesis. In summary, both individuals and organizations will use the vaults to better manage their assets and pursue their investment theses. This allows these strategies to compound more quickly, increasing the TVL in Maker Vaults and the size of the NFT industry. ",

Given the current state of the markets I think NFT prices are going to be highly correlated to ETH also the supply is growing exponentially.   The likely means (at some point) a strong dump of the value indicated here. I have been hearing over and over again that Protocol Engineering is overloaded with tasks and doesn\u2019t need a new one. Given even in the OPs post the best case here basically breaks even and Maker takes a real risk of collateral losses the only cost is an opportunity cost with ongoing protocol losses until this can break even and that is a \u2018best case scenario\u2019. I think in time IF this ecosystem can grow more and we find protocol engineering has time, If Maker has a larger Surplus we can reconsider this application and I want to encourage the OP to not feel like Maker won\u2019t review this positively at a later date. In my opinion doing this is premature, would need application of scarce Maker resources, increase the risk profile likely for a loss to the protocol.  While I appreciate the growth in the NFT space we just don\u2019t have a lot of luxury headroom to take this on.

Let me add that even with ample resources I would recommend we focus on the long-term vision and those highly strategic capacities and counterparties that will get us there. For example, bringing real world assets on-chain and completing our risk assessments, policies and standards for permissionless use by top-tier counterparties and institutions. From this perspective, crypto-punks would be a fun, but niche application worth considering after we have established ourselves at the next major frontier in DeFi (whatever we decide that is!). ",

This is a 83% growth in the span of 1.5 months. We are not looking to reopen the MIP6, but rather simply keep you guys informed. @lollike When you folks at CES have defined the benchmarks for what is considered \u201cgood\u201d collateral, we are keen to have a look and see if reopening the MIP6 is relevant.
