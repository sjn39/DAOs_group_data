                    "content": "Hi everybody in the community! I\u2019m one of the main executive (and co-founder) of a Software House based in Poland. We\u2019re focused mainly in Mobile and Web development. This said, I\u2019ve been a member of the MakerDAO community for already several months, and I\u2019m getting more and more interested in contributing to it actively (this means in what my company and myself know to do the best: software development). I\u2019m very interested in start growing Smart Contract expertise within my company (I know it\u2019ll be not that simple, and probably it\u2019ll make sense to bring some blockchain developer expert to lead our \u201clearning team\u201d). I\u2019ve been already thinking in the best way to kick-off this training to interested members of my team; of course, have our own resources limitations (being Christmas a tough deadline for most of our projects, it is difficult to simply release some devs to study Solidity and play with Smart Contracts when having big amount of work to conclude in other projects). But I\u2019m thinking seriously in conducting this \u201clearning\u201d in the MakerDAO arena. What I\u2019m not sure is, if such learning will be of that big value to MakerDAO right now, for sure if there are things to do in Mobile / Web we\u2019d shine there, but when it comes to our first incursions in Smart Contracts programming, I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a lot of hurdles to solve until having a Smart Contract team that the community could trust in. Really would like to know the community recommendations and advice in this regard, how could we help the most as well. But note, that my biggest interest is to form a Smart Contract team in my company, and it is clear how much we could help MakerDAO if we would have that team to its disposition. If some of you are curious about the company and what we do, feel free to check out our company page, or our design portfolio. Thank you very much in advance for any advise that you could give. It\u2019ll be hard to start during December, but I should make this happen from January. BTW, I had no idea about what Topic or Tags assign to this thread, let me know about this one if possible @LongForWisdom, thanks!! ",

Some have described the consumer internet world working under the motto \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d I would recommend sharing work you\u2019ve done which is mission critical with a zero tolerance for failure. That would probably give the MakerDAO stakeholders the confidence that your team can perform and produce code which is fully robust and can handle operations with large value at stake. Cheers ",

                    "content": "I cannot argue about that motto, sadly it is not a result of developers (in most of the serious cases), it is more a product of the continue negotiation with stakeholders who want all done for yesterday and don\u2019t  want to spend the time and money in building strong test suites for their products. It is my day to day talk with clients, everybody comes to our type of companies with the intention of building an \u201cMVP\u201d for which they don\u2019t want we spend the estimated time (always those tough deadlines)\u2026 The price to pay: the software development cycle is altered and a lot of technical debt is accumulated for \u201cwhen they get those promised funds in their series A-B-C rounds\u201d\u2026 software devs are being then pushed to get results ASAP and don\u2019t spend that much time in automated testing (which is time consuming), and yeap, that simply has one result: to break things. We focus a lot in constructing software using the most highest standards within our clients constraints, applying agile methodologies and DevOps practices to the software development as much as we\u2019re able to. Not saying that always we can spend the time that we\u2019d like with a given software, but for some business critical features there are sometime that \u201czero tolerance for failure\u201d, specially when leading with payments (in several online booking systems we have worked with for instance). But I cannot say that it compares with putting into stake those millions (or billions) flowing through smart contracts. But I would love if I could build that confidence as well within my team (probably it makes sense to start there, before talking of the community trusting in us for it). I\u2019m not interesting in saying that we can do things we haven\u2019t done simply because we\u2019re devs, IMHO, that would be not a realistic statement. Definitely we are focused so far in that consumer internet field, but willing to get into the smart contract development (not few the amount of job requests we have received in this regard). Maybe the best would be to start \u201csmall\u201d, more contributing with the creation of those web pages which I see the community require which interacts with the block chain (most of them using infura.io right now I think), in those there will not be millions in stake. Also something good for the community I hope: I\u2019m not thinking in asking for anything in return for our cooperation if that makes sense, once there are results, up to the community to determine how to effectively premium our efforts. Happy to start taking on some smaller projects for now and showing results with time while I focus in building those required skills within my team. Note, that I personally have great interest in the success of MakerDAO, willing to see MKR price skyrocket and hundred of billions (or trillions) of DAI in circulation\u2026 I know there is a long road till there, and I\u2019m just trying as well to see how I can make my small contribution with what I can offer at this moment.

                    "content": "Thanks @David_Meister for your feedback on this. You\u2019re right about the years, talent and passion you mention there. I studied Physic Engineering, never took that one to practice though, since my time in the university I was linked to groups developing applications, I worked in the development of code and circuits (using MicroC) for PIC and PSoC microcontrollers and a lot of LabView and C++. Then started in the freelancing world developing applications for Android and Backend (specifically with Laravel Framework). I\u2019ve been developing apps for over 15 years if going back to the beginnings (I was in national programming contests in my country, using Pascal then, and also a lot of Delphi for several applications developed for specific private sector applications). Note that I personally have worked at least 2 projects using TDD, I have a very good understanding in how to decouple the code properly using dependency ingestion to make it ready for unit testing, how to build feature / integration tests, system / UI tests, and having those skills myself I\u2019ve worked hard to establish them within my own company. I\u2019m a member of several freelancing organizations, some of them which quite high standards (like Toptal). Having over 30 engineers in the company (which was created 5 years ago) I cannot say it has been an easy task to make them experts testing their own written codes; in fact, I cannot say that more than 5 of them have really those high skills you mention there (most of them are graduated from informatics engineering, and a few of them from Computer Science). Now, those from computer science I\u2019m sure they can produce formal proofs, they have a stronger mathematical background, but I would not agree if we say that only  those with such mathematical skills are able to understand security exploits and write clean, readable and scalable code (I know a lot of mathematician and data scientists who are programmers and knows nothing about good coding practices, and very good information engineers who are not able to solve some simple mathematics puzzles (but probably it doesn\u2019t come down to skills, and more to interest)).     David_Meister:  it\u2019s not as simple as saying \u2018clients never give us a budget\u2019 if the devs are learning on the job   There are more parts to it that\u2019s true, devs with broad skills unit testing their codes work faster (in the long run), I\u2019m one of the supporters of TDD BTW; but I\u2019ve lived in the freelancing world for too long, where budgets are more limited and deadlines are tougher, and where all comes down to how long something will take and to \u201cwho does it faster and cheaper gets the job\u201d (sadly but true!). Lucky to say that the last 3 years have been quite different for myself and my company, but not always I had the time to spare and work for the long run. Letting here an important set of skills within my company (not that I could use all the resources at will to attend opened projects). Worked languages and technologies (strongest skills, ignoring those \u201cknown or worked\u201d  which we don\u2019t do in a daily basis): Mobile:  Android (Java, Kotlin)  Testing (Espresso, Robolectric, Mockito, JUnit 4)   iOS (Swift) Multi platform (Flutter) Framework and Libs  Dagger 2 Android Annotations Android Jetpack and Android Architecture Components    Web:  Front-end (Angular, React, NextJS, Gatsby, Preact)  Testing (Jest, Testcafe, Cypress)   Back-end (Laravel, NodeJS - Express, NestJS)  Testing (Mocha, PHPUnit)    CI / CD:  Gitlab-CI Jenkins Circle-CI  DB:  Relational (MySQL, Postgres) NoSQL (MongoDB, Firestore, Firebase Realtime Database, DynamoDB) Graphs (Neo4J)  Cloud Platforms  AWS Google Cloud  Others:  Chatbots and NLP related applications  DialogFlow Google Cloud NLP and AutoML NL,  AWS Textract    Hope it helps the community to know where it can start with our cooperation. I was wondering if the community was keeping some board with all the works being worked on currently (from where somebody could have an idea of what is needed to be done next?). ",

Happy to take on that one! Have some questions though, not sure if using this post for it, or better to have a call with some community members. Letting some of them opened here though:   Should we create this feature over an already existing tool / code base? Or should be created from scratch?   Design wise, should it follow the same branding (colors, texts, styles in general) like in the current site at https://makerdao.com/? Maybe some of you could point to some branding guidelines document?   Is there some general board the community is using for tracking the progress on these projects / initiatives?   Any member with knowledge in which tech are preferable for building such tools? Servers - cloud providers (if any) preferences? (ie. not sure if you\u2019re deploying all these pages toward IPFS, or there is some cloud provider hosting everything, would be great to get some info about it, also if there is some CI / CD in place, etc).   Finally if somebody could have a quick call to gather all the requirements, I know there are some docs about the process, but a quick call of around 30mins could give me a lot of insight about what is really necessary (and what not).   Not sure how fast we\u2019ll move with it, but I\u2019ll like to ensure to start on it already if that\u2019s fine (or at least, to know already who can I consult in the community for this and who is handling this type of initiative if such person / role already exists of course).

Answering some preliminary questions:   As I understand, that question is being addressed now. We have a skeleton framework from our community-development site, but it may not serve the best purpose for the UX desired in the MIPs portal.   As for the design, the Foundation design team (cc @turbo) has worked on Brand Assets, and the Developer Experience team has been building Dai UI which already has the Comm-Dev designs as well.   @juan will be managing the PM specifically for the MIPs site. If you\u2019re talking about a board for general community projects, there\u2019s way too many to keep track and each team has their own management / stack. Examples: actual MIPs is tracked on this Github board, community development puts various projects on Github boards, (but we are in the process of updating/cleaning up and revisiting another form for this) and there are community teams who have their own PM sheet, and tools that are developed by various community members are hosted on their own repos. Welcome to decentralized coordination    Don\u2019t have the answer to this one - as far as I know, there\u2019s no standardized answer. The Foundation has TechOps that can provide guidance and Developer Experience working on a developer portal, but I\u2019m not sure if it covers this.   @juan is the point person for the MIPs site (cc @longforwisdom @charlesstlouis). Also happy to take a call to get you onboarded to general community projects. You can ping me on Rocketchat - @amy.jung   Another project in mind - We are also looking to refresh https://mkrgov.science/, which will need an update once the new contract is in. This is mostly a web interface, with some on Maker contracts. ",
