Check out the new Agora interface (vote.optimism.io), cast your test vote, and drop some feedback!  This is the place for new delegates to register and for existing delgates to cast votes   New partner fund post  Same restrictions for no sale / lockup. Generally targeted at larger projects that have already achieved product-market fit.   Bedrock vote coming up! Some Q&A with grants council team - if you have feedback on grants council or other season 3 things, drop it here! Community calls on zoom vs discord vs twitter  Who is the target audience? We want to keep quality of discussion high. There may be ways to do a discord call with token-gated permissions (OP labs attestation station?) Only zoom allows screen-sharing Maybe we can do a test community-governance discussion on discord We could also work to broadcast link to call wider, this is something immediate that we can do for next meeting.
