                    "content": "As per the result of the governance vote, we can now proceed to implement the PSM for the tentative launch date of December 18th, 2020. For those just joining please review the Accelerate the PSM thread for an explanation. There are a few things that need to be done before we can launch the PSM. I will list them below, and mark them off as they are completed. Tasks Smart Contract Audits [Complete] Quantstamp has released the audit report and nothing major has been found. Please read the report for yourself, and I\u2019ll add my response below (which I\u2019ll forward to Quantstamp for their followup review). In total there are 5 minor / informational issues that I will address below: QSP-1: The contracts are missing input validation, but this is okay as all methods mentioned are either constructors or admin-authed. This issue exists in most existing Maker contracts anyways, so there is no more risk here than is already present. QSP-2: Informational. Just a note about programming practises. QSP-3: These unused admin functions are in place to allow governance to transfer the PSM to a new contract at a later point in time. This will help us if for example we want to move PSM-USDC-A over to an interest earning implementation. QSP-4: join-5-auth.sol is copied from the existing gem joins repository. This mismatch between public and external visibility is a point I have just corrected, but the issue is present in the gem-joins repository as well. This only affects gas usage in a very minor way, so it is nothing critical. The other points about GemAuthJoin5.exit() and Lerp.tick() are intentional design decisions. exit() needs to be publicly callable for emergency shutdown, and Lerp only works if tick() is publicly callable. QSP-5: This one is also an intentional design decision, and is necessary due to the difference in decimal precision between DAI and USDC. The difference in fee handling mentioned is that fees are subtracted from sellGem() and added on top of buyGem(). Update Jan 11th, 2021: Quantstamp has released their final report. Other Audits Lev has done an informal review here. Risk Analysis [Complete] @Primoz has completed this:     MIP29 - Peg Stability Module (PSM) Risk Assessment Risk       There are two ways to write PSM Risk Assessment. One that is isolated from current 101% LR stablecoins implementation and one that compares PSM with current implementation of low LR stablecoin vaults and its impact on risk. I decided to choose the latter since risks with 101% LR stablecoin vaults were already discussed a couple of times and are well known to the community. Yet, PSM does increase stablecoin exposure among other things and both risks and benefits need to be properly addressed.  In\u2026     Along with signal requests:     [Signal Request] PSM Parameters Signal Requests       Based on the PSM on-chain poll and PSM Risk Assessment provided by @Risk governance needs to decide on two key parameters before having effective PSM module launched:   Stablecoins that will be included in PSM Debt Ceiling per stablecoin  Note that tin and tout parameters were already decided by MKR holders (0.1% tin and 0.1% tout)  Based on PSM Risk Assessment, MakerDAO could well add another 200m or more stablecoins to its collateral portfolio if PSM were to be implemented with 0.1% tin and 0.\u2026     Deploy to Kovan [Complete] Contracts deployed and spell has been cast.

The Foundation has built up some excellent security protocols over the years, so when that time comes we can lean on that infrastructure and policy, but adapt it for the DAO.  There are lots of interesting problems with responsible disclosure in a completely open source project that is also an open protocol with 2.5+ billion in custodial assets. As for using the foundation\u2019s resources for the PSM, I\u2019m afraid @hexonaut is correct, the foundation can\u2019t help.  Quantstamp has a relationship with the DAO, you might try asking them and the dapphub folks.  Other than that, an appeal to @banteg et al. might get some eyes on it.  @andy8052, @wil, @Mariano_Conti, and @iamchrissmith are outside the foundation now, but they too are free actors and may or may not have time to review.

Here is some of my feedback:   Ideally tin and tout should have been rays, rays are typically used for rates that a wad is multiplied by. This doesn\u2019t have any practical impact here though.   It would have been better to round up in the calculation of fee, i.e. uint256 fee = mul(gemAmt18, tin) / WAD;, that way we would always be rounding in favour of system and against the user, which is safer in the presence of rounding errors.   It would have been better to use deployment factories for DssPsm, Lerp, and AuthGemJoin5. Since they were deployed directly through an EOA, it was necessary to enumerate all historical calls in order to audit that the auth there had been appropriately transferred. A deployment factory would have left a clearer paper trail for the auth, since it isn\u2019t possible to check that in the spell.   It would be nice to have some documentation explaining why the hope and nope functions exist in the PSM. I assume it\u2019s for some potential future exit strategy for the collateral, but it\u2019s not documented or tested anywhere AFAICT.   Note that the Quantstamp audit did not include any deployment/\u201csupply chain\u201d validation, so the community should devote special attention to this aspect. There is never a guarantee that the code that is deployed is the same as what is in a repository, and moreover with a multi-step deployment such as this one, there is security-relevant configuration state outside of what is in the main spell.

My plan is : 1 / compound - simple lending ( easier than farming) 2 / compound - farming ( more risk) 3 / aave - ( but I hope I won\u2019t have to do it) the issue is time. it took me 3 weeks to put something together for 1/ which probably need more work, lot more. For example, the PSM which is \u201ceasy\u201d took 1 month to sam to pass through the whole process. And Sam knows a lot. The PSM risk is very low - probably as low as accepting a new user in Maker what ever I said or people said. ",

                    "content": "Now that we have the final Quantstamp report, we can move to the final phase and begin raising the DC towards the previously approved 500M mark. In the interest of balancing risk with the previous governance target of 500M DC, the DAO autonomous group has agreed that we will slowly raise the DC with the lerp module over several weeks. For the next community executive I will be setting the PSM DC to 80M along with a lerp module which raises the DC by 35M / week over the next 12 weeks.  The date for the monthly community executive is TBD, but I\u2019m expecting either end of January or beginning of February. In either case this gives us 2+ weeks of PSM testing at the 30M level. The stablecoin vaults will be set to 0 DC at a later date which is TBD by risk. The PSM UI is also being worked on and should hopefully be ready by end of week. ",

That group doesn\u2019t have the power to decide things of this nature. However, Sam and I did discuss it in that meeting, and no one present had any objections to that process. On balance I feel that the course of action Sam is describing is a good compromise and I\u2019m willing to include it in the next community executive as Sam describes. ",
