                    "content": "MIP49: Staking Rewards is going through the May monthly governance cycle, and I wanted to start discussion on what the starting parameters should be. I\u2019ve constructed a little chart to see how various rewards % amounts correspond to MKR holder\u2019s yearly ROI.  Screen Shot 2021-04-13 at 12.04.09 PM2104\u00d7512 183 KB  As you can see the APR quickly increases the lower the lockup. In particular if we were to stay put in terms of MKR lockup (~20%) then we could offer 10%+ APR with only 50% of the burner redirected to the rewards contract. This may not seem like a lot compared to the farming rewards available out there, but I think we are within striking distance. I will attempt to profile a few types of DeFi degens in increasing amounts of degeneracy:  The Sound Sleeper The Sound Sleeper likes to keep MKR in her cold wallet. She trusts the Maker protocol, so she already participates in voting, but isn\u2019t interested in touching yield farms with a 10 foot pole.  The DeFi Chad The DeFi Chad has a busy life-style. He heard about this crypto thing, but doesn\u2019t want to spend too much time hunting around. DeFi Chad uses Yearn and a high collateralization ratio, so he only needs to check in once a day.  The Rik Rik has an insatiable appetite for maximum yields. No he will not waste money on Yearn performance fees. He does his own research and keeps his collateralization ratios on the bleeding edge. Let\u2019s see how they compare with various rewards setups:  Screen Shot 2021-04-13 at 2.55.55 PM1664\u00d7888 141 KB  As you can see it is possible to bring competitive yields to the Sound Sleeper profile vs the DeFi Chad. It\u2019s hard to say how many fit the Chad profile, but my guess is this is the majority of farmers as it is the most benefit / least work. Being a true DeFi degen requires reading code, keeping up with new launches and re-adjusting your CR frequently to ride the line. Even then the risk / reward calculus is not the same. MKR staking rewards are much safer on many fronts including smart contract risk, price risk, etc. It may be that a number of Riks will be willing to hang up their degen hats for a safe 20% APR. The above numbers assume a 20% rewards lockup which is larger than the current amount locked in the chief, but we can probably expect some inflows from users who are just there for the rewards. It\u2019s hard to estimate what the actual result will be, but we can probably deduct users like the Foundation, MKR holders still inside the foundation and a good chunk of lost/forgotten MKR. My guess at a reasonable upper bound is 50% locked in rewards, but who knows. Even in that scenario we can provide 10% APR if we direct all burner MKR into the rewards contract. In any case, this is something that can be tweaked as we go. Starting with maybe a small 10% or so to see how things go and gradually ramp it up/down as needed. I think this is a good parameter for Parameter Proposal Groups to adjust based on market analysis. IE we could have a mandate to keep the rewards as low as possible, while trying to balance with the MKR locked in third party lending protocols. Please discuss.  ",

That is, non-staked MKR could pay staked MKR in a way that is net-zero for the surplus buffer or fee collection. Just to make it clear, this could work as:  print MKR sell MKR to DAI distribute DAI to stakers  This is probably not an efficient way to do it. Smarter people than me could probably figure out how to get the same effect without slippage and with fewer transactions. I realize that such a scheme is completely different from MIP49 and is probably off-topic for this thread. ",

We will want to see various governance participation metrics as rewards are turned up.  To see what rewards levels get any additional participation Where return fall off occurs.  Also not sure if this can be done, but can rewards be related to some participation metrics? i.e. vote/hat participation.   I think the real issue is securing the hat but I also think these rewards should have some relationship to participation. I also am not entirely sure how to deal with incentivizing the larger voting blocks.    I honestly think delegation may help with that.   Which is another issue.   Somehow this voting rewards implementation needs to be distinguished from other changes to governance. It might be that something as simple as delegation gets us far more MKR governance participation than rewards does alone.   We really want a way to distinguish this vs. doing two things simultaneously and wondering which one got us the biggest bang for the change/buck. I don\u2019t know which is easier to implement (delegation vs. staking rewards) but changes to these should be staggered AT LEAST 3 months apart to get cleaner response signals. Last point I made elsewhere.   If these rewards come in DAI they could easily be coupled to SC DAI or other payouts saving distribution costs.   Also a consideration to have an option to receive these on a sidechain/L2 would be nice as well. @hexonaut nice to see you pushing this in a way that connects to MKR burn events.   I think these incentives really need budgets because you may want to modulate rewards based on burn but you don\u2019t want to axe them entirely with no burn.   Some of the most important times for governance participation where when Maker system was stressed the most.    Keep this in mind.   Continuity is important for people.   Nothing worse to a return seeker than returns that fluctuate massively. ",

So you have to pick either or. I also want to avoid just telling Aave to turn off MKR borrowing. That may solve the problem temporarily, but another lending platform will almost certainly list MKR in the future. Maybe a platform less friendly towards Maker. ",

Sure it is possible that in the future another lender could have both and maybe have better rates to siphon off MKR collateral but not for the foreseeable future so short/medium term it seems like a reasonable option. As for YFI trying with Aave: They did it in a hostile way to start which probably didn\u2019t work out in their favour and if we are going to build a stronger relationship with them in regards to D3M they might look at us differently. If that still doesn\u2019t work we could see if there is a price (from us) where turning off borrowing would make sense. Streaming a payment to them in return for the risk/reward on both sides might be a reasonable compromise. ",

Yield made by borrowing stablecoins on your MKR at Aave and deposititing them onto some farm may be higher, but you have Aave protocol risk, liquidation risk and SC risk of farming venues. With that in mind I think some equilibrium can probably be reached where 10% of MKR is staked which at 25% burn represents around 12% risk free yield. So some of the MKR supply at Aave should probably move to governance contract because some MKR suppliers don\u2019t want to risk too much. I just hope this doesn\u2019t lead to having large amount of MKR being stuck on some old hats, because some people who deposited MKR in governance contract would vote only occasionally.
