                    "content": "About two years ago I set up two Parity archive nodes on custom-built Linux boxes with internal 4TB SSD hard drives (don\u2019t ask \u2013 I have a reason). Currently, they are both at 94% full with about 220 GB of free space, and I\u2019m looking for any ideas of where to go from here. Is anyone out there running Parity archive nodes? Are you anticipating it outgrowing a 4TB drive? Are you running the nodes locally? Are you running them on a datacenter? How much is it costing you? I can\u2019t find an internal SSD any larger than 4TB \u2013 is an internal drive needed? I\u2019m pretty sure an SSD is needed - is that still true? Any help or advice from people running archive nodes would be appreciated. I\u2019ll collect together and write up a Medium post if I get some useful information. ",

                    "content": "Hey @tjayrush, I\u2019m interested in hearing more about your use case and why you require a full archive node. As far as SSDs go, I\u2019m running a couple non-archiving nodes with several days with of history before pruning and they require SSDs just to keep in sync. I\u2019m running the nodes in the cloud though and it cost a fortune. I think what most people are doing that have \u201carchival\u201d use cases is indexing the new data as it comes in into a database. There are several different strategies on that front. If you could share a little more about your use case (the queries you are running, not necessarily why you are running them), then I might be able to help. ",

                    "content": "I solved my issue with the SSD disc size. I added a second 4TB drive to each node (I now have two nodes with 8TB drives each). The person who set it up for me used Raid 0. Works well. As far as why I\u2019m running an archive node, it\u2019s a long story. I\u2019m trying to understand what would be needed to make a single user\u2019s data fully available to them without a third party involved at all \u2013 in other words \u2013 any user should be able to get any data they want from ONLY the node. I don\u2019t technically need an archive node (but I do need a --tracing node). I used the historical balances/data state to \u2018debug\u2019 my work. Without an archive node, if there\u2019s a bug somewhere in my code (which scans accounts for a list of historical transactions), I can\u2019t really tell where the error is unless I \u2018reconcile\u2019 at the end of each transaction. Once my code works, I really don\u2019t need the archive node. The project is called TrueBlocks (http://trueblocks.io). ",
