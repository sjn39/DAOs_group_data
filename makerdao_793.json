It\u2019s a regular monthly budget of 90,250.00 DAI from May 2022 until April 2023, included.  Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP64 adds the budget for Data Insights Core Unit (DIN-001) to account for the new mandate that expands on the initial mission to maintain the existing data assets and build new datasets to cover L2s, RWAs, and puts a special focus on the community. The main changes are the following:  59,500 DAI \u2192 90,250.00 DAI per month (+52%) 6 month budget \u2192 12 month budget Team headcount increase Expansion Pool MKR vesting program Travel budget   Specification  Motivation We are proposing this budget for the Data Insights Core Unit to be able to continue our mission to provide free and permissionless datasets with contextualized and enriched MCD Protocol data and to continuously support and empower other members of the DAO and Community in the field of data analytics and data science. The previous mandate was defined as a kind of Proof of Concept to validate the need of a data focused Core Unit. It was mostly limited to supporting other Core Units by maintaining and updating the existing assets. The new mandate expands on the initial mission to build completely new datasets to cover L2s, RWAs, and puts a special focus on the community. This budget represents a 52% increase (59,500.00 DAI to 90,250.00 DAI per month) from the previous budget. The Data Insights Core Unit currently consists of three full-time members and one part-time facilitator. We have just hired one full-time member and we are planning to increase our workforce by an additional 1-2 contributors in the near future.  Core Unit ID DIN-001  Current status Having completed four out of the six months of the initial proposal, we believe we have demonstrated the value of this Core Unit to the protocol, to other Core Units ,as well as to the wider community. In the following post you can find an in-depth overview of the work done and the associated financials: link here. We would like to highlight the following aspects:   We constantly develop and maintain analytical datasets and GUIs covering many aspects of the protocol\u2019s history (vaults, users, voting, liquidations, debt/surplus auctions, system parameters, etc.)   We regularly engage with other Core Units, providing them with various services: from Data API (for analysis and as backends for their applications) to reports, analyses and visualisations:  Risk CU GovAlpha CU Growth CU Strategic Finance CU    We continuously engage with partners (such as Oazo/oasis.app) and community members.   We have been fiscally responsible by:  Creating our own contingency buffer by reducing the team salaries in order to maintain operations if the current proposal is delayed or to gracefully wind down the Core Unit in case of rejection/offboarding. Optimizing costs, making it possible to return excess of funds to the protocol (currently estimated at 12% of total initial budget). Not incorporating a dedicated company and therefore being able to return the excess funds of 10,000 DAI originally allocated as the Incorporation Budget.     Roadmap The roadmap proposed below is a natural continuation to our current roadmap. We want to highlight the importance that L2s and RWAs will have in our future.  2332\u00d7474 50.9 KB  We plan to adhere to the upcoming SES Ecosystem Performance initiative, making our work more accessible to delegates and the community. In addition, we are looking into new tools that would allow the community to engage and provide direct feedback.  Budget Breakdown The budget has been designed re-using mechanisms implemented by other Core Units to enable greater transparency and standardisation throughout the DAO. We deeply appreciate their work, in particular that of SES.  Dai Expenditure We are asking for a Annual Budget Cap of 1,083,000.00 DAI. The cap refers to the maximum that the Core Unit can request for operating and it includes room for unforeseen circumstances. The distribution of budget across these components is shown below:     Cost component Amount     Team costs DAI 39,500.00   - Current Team DAI 39,500.00   Data costs DAI 17,500.00   - Decoded source data costs DAI 17,500.00   Infrastructure costs DAI 3,100.00   - AWS infrastructure DAI 1,000.00   - Snowflake subscription DAI 2,000.00   - Other subscriptions DAI 100.00   Operational costs DAI 5,150.00   - Finance, admin DAI 3,500.00   - Travel DAI 1,650.00   Expansion Pool DAI 25,000.00    The total monthly budget asked for is DAI 90,250.00 for the 12 months period from May 2022 until April 2023, included.  Expansion Pool We want to be fully transparent but also very flexible to meet the future demands of the protocol. With that in mind, we want to request a dedicated pool of funds that will be used for a variety of purposes, all of them with the goal of increasing the value delivered to the protocol. These uses include hiring new team members, funding grants to community members, engaging in partnerships and using new tools and services. Our thinking in requesting such a pool of funds is that we want to avoid misappropriating allocated funds while acknowledging that our current plans can change in the future in the the best interest of the protocol. To exemplify the above: the previous budget allocated funds for a part-time front-end developer. We ultimately realised it was not the best use of our resources given that we could maximise our impact by collaborating and empowering other Core Units building front-ends. We recently hired a new team member that has a wide range of skills but can be mostly categorised as back-end. This could be considered a misappropriation of funds so we hope our intentions are not misconstrued by the community. Another example of this is the use of additional services. While we currently host all of our data pipelines ourselves, we are considering using a managed service that would reduce our workload, allowing us to shift our focus from maintaining datasets to building new ones.  Contingency The Expansion Pool also includes the contingency buffer of ~3% of the total budget to cover infrastructure related unexpected expenses, but could potentially help us in case of miscalculations in other budget items such as Operational Costs. We are discussing a potential implementation of a new tooling to make data more accessible, particularly Redash. This will allow more users to make use of our datasets, given that we pay per use, if the tool is successful in attracting more users than expected, this will ultimately increase the cost of both hosting and database costs. We will publish our financials on a quarterly basis, attributing the ultimate use of those funds to the appropriate budget item.  MKR Vesting We propose a MKR Vesting program in line with the one set out by the SES Core Unit.  Estimated MKR Expenditure The Estimated MKR Expenditure is our best guess of how much MKR will be used with the current team configuration. Reasons why the Actual MKR Expenditure could rise closer to the MKR Expenditure Cap:  A raise for a member of the team New hires (two are covered by the cap) Repricing (and resetting) the program, in the case of bear market   MKR Amount Forecast For the permanent team, assuming the team configuration remains the same as today, this would result in the vesting schedule below.     Vesting Date MKR Amount     31 May 2023 110.16 MKR   30 Nov 2023 55.08 MKR   31 May 2024 55.08 MKR   30 Nov 2024 55.08 MKR   31 May 2025 55.08 MKR   Total 330.48 MKR    This covers the total vesting schedule of 3 years for the current 3.25 FTEs. Any changes to these amounts and its disbursement will be reported in the quarterly financials.  Vesting Parameters     Property Value     MKR/USD lock-in Method Trailing 6 month average   MKR/USD lock-in Price USD 2,428.74   MKR Price Floor -30%   Vesting Period 3 years   Cliff Vest 12 months   Vesting Schedule After cliff has expired, the MKR amount vests every 6 months   Manual Repricing yes   Auto-Renewal yes     Total MKR Expenditure Cap The total MKR Expenditure will not exceed 925.50 MKR. This covers the maximum of a 3 year plan for 5.25 FTEs.  Budget implementation  Core Unit wallet This budget implementation is a \u201cSimple Budget Implementation\u201d under MIP40c4.

Rather than focus on \u2018expansion\u2019 can you elaborate on what the minimum expenses this CU could function with and explain in detail the requirement for a 49% increase.   What does Maker lose if you don\u2019t get your 49% expansion. You also write:     tmierzwa:  To exemplify the above - the previous budget allocated funds for a part-time front-end developer that we ultimately realised was not the best use of our resources given that we could maximise our impact by collaborating and empowering other core units building front-ends.

                    "content": "Hi, @MakerMan  thanks for your feedback.     MakerMan:  What does Maker lose if you don\u2019t get your 49% expansion.   In such case DICU would need to focus on maintaining existing assets and will not be able to keep up with the demand for new data domains, particularly L2s, which are particularly time sensitive. We also think it would not be possible to support the RWA efforts of onboarding external data into the DAO. This requires a lot of up-front dedication before being able to provide a tangible service/tooling/framework for the community. We would expect other CUs dedicating their own resources to this and therefore generating more inefficiencies throughout the DAO.     MakerMan:  This is the kind of initial waste I expect in bringing up new CUs that would lead to a later reduction in budgetary needs. Perhaps better co-ordination with other units like DUX etc. that would be better suited (and could be specifically tasked with making front ends for data) would be beneficial from a cost perspective.   We believe that collaborating with other CUs is very valuable, including, but not limited to, from an impact / cost perspective.The counterpoint is the need for some redundancy, given our decentralised model. In line with that, we still find value in creating our own data frontends using existing resources within the team. This is particularly useful when showcasing new datasets and making them more widely accessible. A recent example of this is the Protocol Parameters dataset, now accessible through the Governance Tracker.     MakerMan:  The above \u2018should\u2019 be going towards reducing expenses because less resources (most certainly TechOps btw) should be required. The idea of expanding is great in theory but the funds have to come from somewhere, and be sustainable and the organization to make effective decisions on budgets has to know what we don\u2019t gain or what we might lose if the budget is NOT expanded (or worse contracted).   We agree, the above example would help use improve the  expense to output ratio. The main reason to have the Expansion pool instead of keeping the separate budget items is to be able to make cost effective decisions moving forward.     MakerMan:  Regarding 24/7/365 TechOps part of your budget, would the services needed here be suitable for the TechOps CU unit generally? Point here is that if 24/7/365 TechOps is needed for each CU to do this effectively 1 man deep requires 6 FTEs (to include 24/7/365 coverage, sick, vacation, etc.)   We wouldn\u2019t expect so. The current challenges are related to ETL workflows orchestration (which is quite domain specific), not service maintenance. This is similar to the benefits of using the cloud managed Snowflake instead a self-hosted PostgreSQL database. The wording in the post was misleading, apologies.     MakerMan:  So the last question here is what is the minimum budget this team could work with and still produce the basic services that are absolutely needed that without would break basic MakerDAO services somewhere.   The minimum budget that would allow to maintain (not build) would be the continuation of the original one (0% increase). But we would not be able to generate a contingency/continuation buffer as we did before, so we would need to request the additional funds to cover any potential usage spikes in our infrastructure (AWS, Snowflake) and to gracefully unwind the CU in the case of an offboarding or an emergency shutdown. However, as the protocol continues to evolve, we expect the number of data requests to increase accordingly. If we do not meet these requirements, other CUs will have to deal with it, which will ultimately lead to higher costs. ",

The problem with the way this is proposed, there is no opportunity to reject the expanded PR budget without defunding your CU, all-or nothing, if I understand correctly. From a game theoretic perspective this is coercion. In general, a CU mandate refresh and budget expansions should probably be presented independent of a budget supporting ongoing operations.   ",

We will be building new products, but maintenance of existing assets constantly increases with any new addition and takes more and more time. It is not just about the technical level. When we start working on any new initiative, we are committed to supporting it in the long term, which means making periodic improvements and modifications while coordinating with stakeholders. We also constanlty respond to ad-hoc requests, such as the Flapper Keeper dataset & visualisation to support a signal request discussion. Additionally, we acknowledge that reporting requirements of the DAO evolve in time. This will also increase our workload. Another lesson from the past period is that communicating what we have built is crucial and we must not assume that everyone is reading our forum posts or visiting our website. We know we need to dedicate more time to this. ",

We believe that information available to the Recognized Delegates must also be available to the general community so voters may make fully informed decisions. This post is intended to detail how we currently utilize data from DIN-001 and how we might adapt if their budget proposal was not funded. We lean on DIN-001 primarily in the following ways:  Recognized Delegate Maintenance (Metrics tracking and Compensation varribles) Building on-chain effects into the voting portal (via DUX-001) Data API for our Governance Health Dashboard  Catflip Successor UI (in development from dSpot) Ranked Choice Voting Analysis (in progress, thanks to @tadeo )  We believe in building resilient systems, and thanks to our technical hire, @hernandoagf, we are confident we could either buy the data we are using and feed that into our processes or recreate some of the APIs ourselves. With that said, it would represent an increase in spending and labor for GovAlpha if the APIs we are currently getting from DIN-001 were to disappear. While all of the DAO sourcing their data from DIN-001 would represent a centralization risk, it is also worth noting that external providers will likely be more expensive and less responsive to the changing desires of the community. GovAlpha does not have an opinion on this particular budget proposal and has provided these points of consideration in the interests of transparency for the community. We are happy to answer any questions about what data is used for the projects mentioned above, as well as any questions pertaining to our collaboration. ",

                    "content": "Any modern business has data insight needs. The Data Insights Core unit (DIN-001) has demonstrated foresightedness and restraint in its use of the current budget allocated here. This is demonstrated by their willingness to return 10,000 DAI of the incorporation budget and another approximately 45,000 DAI of unused monthly budget. It is quite natural for data insight needs to grow when they are fulfilled timely and with consistent quality. DIN-001 wants to tackle additional data insight challenges arising from Layer two integrations and from RWA collateralization. This initiative can only be applauded. Three questions come to mind:  Is DIN-001 the appropriate place for layer-two data insights, or should that be provided by another core unit? Is DIN-001 the appropriate place for RWA data insights, or should that be provided by the respective core unit? Have alternative avenues of sourcing these insights been sufficiently explored?  From a business perspective, it makes sense to centralize data insights and analytics in a single core unit and not have each unit with insight demands maintain its own set of data and analysts. This provides synergies and ultimately cost savings. Nevertheless, the same is true vice-versa. It does not make sense for DIN-001 to develop, e.g. RWA data, when it is already developed elsewhere as a necessary part of that operation. This is why, while I support the notion of increasing the data insight CU\u2019s budget, I want to make sure not to support mission creep. I want to see the most cost-effective solution to data insight needs, and I\u2019m confident that DIN-001 have thought in depth about why they are the best place for L2 and RWA data insights and hope they can clarify that in response.

This is highly dependent on collaboration as we mainly source use-cases from other CUs. What exactly we end up building depends a lot with whom we are collaborating with; in some cases it\u2019s a more performant data feed and in others an analysis on voting behaviour.  Multiple CUs need to look at very similar L2 metrics, such as amount of non-canonical DAI in the chain, volume of other stable coins, amount transacted with each at different timescales, etc. We can then work with each CU to further tailor to their particular needs. RWAs involve multiple parties, including multiple CUs. We are working with several parties to first understand what information/data can be shared to help set-up a workflow to provide the data to the wider community. We are constantly trying to find better ways to support the DAO and the community. We collaborate with many CUs because they see more value in our services than doing it themselves or with another entity. We also aim at creating tools rather than products so CUs and other community members can work independently.  ",

Additionally, TradFi has a tendency for single ad-hoc implementations of systems and the reliance on emailed documentation. All these factors attest against the effective scaling of Maker\u2019s RWA initiatives. Members of our team have previously worked with financial institutions and have the expertise to execute efficiently within this environment. We aim to build a framework and tools to empower our colleagues in RWF, LOVE and our partners, namely RWA Co & 6S Capital, to execute their mandates effectively by making RWA data as available as we\u2019ve made on-chain data. A framework that will make it easy to replicate our efforts with every new deal and tools aimed at helping community members interact with RWA without having DICU as its gatekeeper.  L2s The advent of L2s means that there are now more than one data source. Each chain has its own specificities that will be translated into different deployments of the core infrastructure of Maker. This is a global effort that involves not only technical Core Units. We see our role as a critical support for the multiple core units. We want to create unified datasets to abstract away the complexities and make it fully accessible to everyone in the community. With every chain, there\u2019s a replication effort of data feeds as well as an increased need to maintain changes in the different chains and exposing the cross-chain interactions. This is a time sensitive initiative, the collaborating core units need data insights to inform their decisions so we are focusing on how to be quick at responding to needs and proactively laying the groundwork for it.  Other areas While we highlighted RWA and L2s, we see other domains within Maker where we believe we can provide value in the next year. Governance has become an incredibly time consuming activity, discussions in the forum are often not supported with the right data. To effectively scale the DAO we all need to focus on data-driven decision making. ",

Would it be accurate to say the focus so far has been more on supporting other CUs and as a byproduct, what\u2019s created becomes available for the community or has there been equal time and thought given to what specifically would be useful to be made public?  I\u2019m not saying what\u2019s better, just trying to understand what will be driving the roadmap. In regards to maintenance, all these costs are understandable.  Thank you for breaking them down.  It might be good in the future to also break down exactly how much time is going toward maintenance and how much toward new features.  There\u2019s not much you can do about things like protocol changes but I guess the hope would be that as time goes on, those monitoring, maintenance, and support costs would decrease for fully implemented features that have become more solidified and documented.  Not as much worried about infrastructure costs, more so anything that takes up time. ",

I\u2019m going to voluntarily resign from this role at the end of April and we will submit a MIP to onboard @tadeo as a new Facilitator. I will stay in the team on a part-time advisory role. By design, the previous budget was focused on servicing a limited number of Core Units to validate the value that a data specific team can provide for the DAO. We know we failed to engage with the wider community outside of those Core Units. Moving forward we will actively communicate updates on our planned activities and ongoing work, and also present the products services and tools in an approachable way to the entire community. The first example could be the public listings in the Snowflake Marketplace (Maker Protocol Parameters and Maker Vaults History), that we finalised last Friday and which we are going to announce to the community next week.  image1920\u00d71219 126 KB  ",
