As a result, many of the crypto newcomers trying DeFi for the first time are not being on-boarded on Ethereum anymore but on EVM chains like Fantom, Avalanche or other L1\u2019s altogether such as Solana. The adoption of Layer-2 networks thus far has been promising but too slow considering the competitive landscape. Three main blockers exist:   Missing Incentives Networks like Avalanche, Celo and Near are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to attract developers and users. Without a token, rollups can\u2019t revert to the same strategy. On the other hand, a lot of the Ethereum native DeFi protocols sit on billion dollar treasuries that are waiting to be deployed for productive purposes.   Missing fiat on-ramps   Without direct on-ramps onto Layer-2 networks users face high barriers before they can enjoy the benefits of these networks. These users have no other choice but to withdraw from a CEX to Ethereum to then bridge up from Ethereum to the promised land of Layer-2. On a day where fees on Ethereum mainnet are high, a user starting with $200 easily loses half of their portfolio.  Slow application migration to Layer-2\u2019s Perhaps the most surprising is how slow some protocols are to deploy on Layer-2\u2019s. This can partly be attributed to composability effects, where applications relying on other protocols to exist need to wait on their partner protocol to deploy first (e.g Ribbon \u2192 Opyn, DeFi Saver \u2192 Aave etc.). But to a large extent applications seem to take their time because the growth statistics (volumes, tvl, unique users etc.) are simply not compelling enough.  This is a typical chicken-egg problem where every party involved stands still until the other moves. Users are waiting for subsidies and more applications to use, centralized exchanges and application developers on the other hand are waiting to see user adoption first to justify the integration efforts.  800\u00d7450 346 KB  Uniswap is in a unique position to kickstart growth by launching a liquidity mining campaign on Layer-2. For one, it sits on a $11 billion dollar treasury (!!) that is currently being underutilized. Secondly, as one of the most essential money legos in the DeFi ecosystem the move would have a strong signalling power and trigger more applications to follow suit and invest resources into deploying on Layer-2. Third, the resulting liquidity and yields would set into motion a large-scale migration of users which in return has spillover effects on other factors (CEX on-ramps, devs deploying etc.) . Per Uniswap governance guidelines this forum post is merely a temperature check. Details such as the amount of rewards or the length of the liquidity mining program are better left for the Consensus check. In order to move to the next stage, this proposal needs a majority yes with a min. threshold of 25k $UNI on Snapshot. Link to snapshot: Snapshot ",

Its not even 1B\u2026more like 150-200M USD which would get distressed even more if a liquidity campaign would ensue. Liquidity mining is a great way to bootstrap liquidity onto a freshly launched project, but it proves to be quite parasitic in the long run. I\u00b4d say there is a better path to take than liquidity mining such as OlympusDAO has implemented. The problem with liquidity mining is that it leaves a negative footprint once it ends. Liquidity is loyal only to the person who pays. Why should UNI token holders bear this burden? What do they get in return besides the fact that they will get utterly dilluted? The real problem for L2s is like you outlined in your point - fiat-on ramps. As long as the big CEXs do not adopt L2s, nothing is truly going to change. Liquidity mining will just burn through the UNI holders\u00b4 value. Also, I think this is a duplicate thread.

Uniswap has been very careful with choosing what chains to deploy on, opting to only deploy to chains that are \u201cideologically aligned\u201d with the Ethereum ecosystem. So far, this has only been Arbitrum and Optimism. Both Arbitrum and Optimism don\u2019t have native tokens, and must therefore rely on the application layer to incentivize adoption. Uniswap is definitely the best positioned project to provide this incentivization given that it a) has the largest market cap of any DeFi project and b) has a massive treasury. This chart from Avalanche - CryptoFees.info shows the total fee revenue on Avalanche, with the purple dot representing the start of their liquidity mining campaign. Liquidity mining is an incredibly powerful tool to bootstrap a network.  image1182\u00d7678 62.3 KB  Responding to some of @Buckerino\u2019s points:  I\u00b4d say there is a better path to take than liquidity mining such as OlympusDAO has implemented  OlympusDAO has definitely pioneered a great alternative to standard liquidity mining. It would be very interesting for Uniswap to consider bonded purchases of UNI/ETH LP tokens into the Uniswap treasury.  As long as the big CEXs do not adopt L2s, nothing is truly going to change  This may be a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem, CEXs don\u2019t support L2s since they don\u2019t have users, and users aren\u2019t on L2s because there\u2019s insufficient CEXs. A liquidity mining campaign is at least a worthwhile experiment to stir up some noise around Ethereum L2s.  One final thought I\u2019ll add: AMMs like Uniswap truly succeed with long-tail assets. It may be worth waiting for Arbitrum and Optimism to fully remove the whitelists from their token bridges before incentivizing adoption of L2s. ",

The performance of the protocol has not been in alingment for quite some time with the performance of the token. It has been proven that the liquidity will not stay once the incentives run out. Discounted OlympusDAO bonds provide a better alternative where the UNI holders providing the liquidity incentive do not get stiffed. I do not see any reason why this would not be a better alternative. I think there is a general misconception of what the UNI treasury is capable of doing. Whilst I do agree that not every subsidy has to have a ROI attached to it (UGP, DeFi Fund), this one certainly would need to have it. We are talking about 10Ms worth of USD in subsidies for the success of unaffiliated companies with effectively nothing in return for the people who are supposed to foot the bill. Effectively, the Uniswap treasury is only worth as much as the liquidity on the market allows it to be. Currently, any argument saying the treasury is worth more than 180-200M USD is absolutely absurd and imaginary to say the least. Proposing to cut double digit value out of it for vague benefits is outright provocative/taunting at best. ",

I am keen to see how the liquidity mining would be structured. In response to @Buckerino:  I still dont see a reason why the UNI holders should subsidize it for everyone else. What do the token holders get in return?  As we have seen governance has not had much participation. Having a liquidity mining program is a great way to also get new users engaged with Uniswap through another avenue of distributing out the token into new paricipants. Yes, some may sell, but other\u2019s will see the value in uniswap and the onboared ecosystem to become more involved. The sushiswap, and olympusdao forums have active dialogues in governance forums, while also having distribution model of tokens into the market.  Discounted OlympusDAO bonds provide a better alternative where the UNI holders providing the liquidity incentive do not get stiffed. I do not see any reason why this would not be a better alternative.  I also think the OlympusDAO model of liquidity distribution through bonds is a good idea. It also makes sense with uniswap TWAP\u2019s to allow more security of oracle pricing through stable liquidity. I am unsure if this the avenue for this particular proposal, or a seperate one. ",

Inefficiencies worth millions of dollars. Why waste resources? It does not make sense to throw money out of the window if better options are on the table. Regarding your point on governance not having much participation, UNI actually had liquidity mining campaign a year ago. It did not revive the governance part of the token, did it? All it did was provide temporary boost whilst sucking out value from the token holders and then left. This would be the exact same result. UNI holders would lose value and get little in return. ",

The first mining program was more of a reaction to sushiswap\u2019s mining program. Yes, many sold UNI. I do think we had more engagement at the time in the forums; as UNI had just been launched. I see this program as being proactive, and a way to educate and incentivize new users to the L2 ecosystem (while also reimburse cost of trying L2 ecosystem) VS the old reactive liquidity mining that incentivized established users who moved around to different farming to just sell. I am in support of this temperature check, and it will be good to see how the liqudity program is actually structured (I would be on board with a bonding progam as well if that seems to make more sense). It is better to be in a position of setting the tone on onboarding new users, rather than to be on the heels of another protocol. ",

The origin of the \u201cnew liquidity\u201d you indicated is questionable to say the least. There is simply no supporting argument saying that the cost of a liquidity mining campaign supports liquidity in the long run. The majority of liquidity goes away and the costs are huge. This liquidity blip you indicated was attained at the cost of having the mcap of the UNI token halve - 350M USD in marketcap lost + additional inflation of the coin which is never going to reverse. Is it worth it? In my eyes, absolutely not. If we were to do this same liquidity mining campaign today on the same scale, the token would lose vast majority (90 % btw) of its value. How is it fair to the token holders? Like I\u00b4ve said before, there is absolutely no reason to do it in this fashion instead of OlympusDAO model. At least there its proven the liquidity will stay so why are we even talking about it? Why would we pursue a less efficient model? Why would we want to make the token holders lose value when they dont have to? Is there some kind of a fetish that the token holders\u00b4 value must go down?

I think incentivizing top pools (maybe just stablecoin/ETH pools or a select few others) for a short period will help cement Uniswap v3 as the preeminent DEX and liquidity schelling point for L2. And if Uniswap can support better L2 liquidity and trading experience, this will help onboard more small size users who are currently forced to use alternative DEX platforms on sidechains. Incentivizing liquidity on v3 pools is somewhat complicated - giving yield only to LPs that are within the active tick can have negative side effects (see Ribbon finance for example: https://twitter.com/freddycoen/status/1460919501428559879?s=20). So maybe it would be better to incentivize wider ranges or get creative on exactly how rewards are calculated. Also think it could be productive to work with automation services like Gelato to offer better LP UX on L2 before we offer incentives. ",

Re: which pairs to incentivize, I was actually thinking of only including key stabecoin/ETH pairs similar to the first Uni liquidity mining propgram in my next proposal for the Consensus check, just for the sake of making it as uncontentious as possible. But there\u2019s definitely an argument to be made to include tokens of 1-2 key projects on each L2 (e.g SNX on Optimism). Regarding widening the range for LP\u2019s I agree 100% as well. This should be an opportunity to introduce normal users to Uni V3 lp\u2019ing - not just gift $UNI to whales and market makers. I think most V3 LP schemes work in a way that you get more rewards the closer your range is to the spot price. I will get in touch with the Gelato and Visr teams as well as other experts to see if this can be tweaked so that everyone get\u2019s the same rewards as long as they are within a certain range (e.g \u00b1 20%).

I agree 100% that the Uni v3 Staker contract is not a good idea as it does incentivize a lot of opportunistic single-tick farmers, who are the least aligned with the project and create downward pricing pressure. At Visor, we can work together with the Uniswap team to determine the right range to provide liquidity at.  Our main Hypervisor contract interacts directly with the Uni v3 core contracts and we can dynamically set +/- x% range around the current price tick and automate rebalances when the price moves +/- y% from the center of the range.  Alternatively, we can apply our own Auto Regressive Strategy which is designed to mitigate IL by widening ranges during high volatility periods and narrowing them during lower volatility time periods. Because all our LPs would be within the same range, it wouldn\u2019t be possible to game the LM mechanics through providing large single-tick ranges. Happy to answer more questions about our LM program and would love to be part of the solution. ",

                    "content": "TL;DR: UNI liquidity mining rewards should be based on the amount of time the price is within the LP token\u2019s range. Hi all\u2013 The goal of the liquidity mining program should be to increase active liquidity. What I mean by active liquidity? Let\u2019s look at a few pools on mainnet: First, ETH-USDC-0.3%: info[dot]uniswap[dot]org/#/pools/0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8 (I can\u2019t embed links or media it seems, otherwise I would have posted a screenshot). We\u2019ve had a rather large downward price move in recent days and the \u201cliquidity peak\u201d is away from the current price. However, there are still enough funds locked at the current tick (>2M USDC in active liquidity) to limit slippage and be resilient against large buys-sells. On the other hand, let\u2019s look at the ETH-MKR-0.3% pool: info[dot]uniswap[dot]org/#/pools/0xe8c6c9227491c0a8156a0106a0204d881bb7e531 There is only 1.87 ETH lock at the current tick, that\u2019s only $7,500 out of the $355m in TVL (!!). As a result, a relatively small transaction can drastically shift the price of MKR. Clearly, most LPs do not care about rebalancing, or perhaps they\u2019re OK holding MKR, but the amount of active liquidity is way too small compared to the TVL. The problem with the current LP staking contract is that it rewards users according to the effective liquidity, which is basically proportional to the amount of fees collected. Whales and market makers can easily shift their LP position in response to large price moves because gas costs will not matter as much once you cross a certain level (>$10,000?). Smaller players, on the other hand, will rapidly get wiped out because burn+rebalance+re-deploy may incur $100\u2019s in gas fees. How do we solve this? How can smaller players that do not have time to actively manage their LP position still be rewarded for contributing liquidity in a manner that is proportional to their actual stake? I am proposing to reward all LPs who have any amount of liquidity at the current tick. For example, if the current price is 4,280, then locking 1 ETH in the ETH-USDC pool between 1,000-32,000 will receive as much UNI reward as locking 1 ETH between 4275-4300. But LPs that deployed 1 ETH to either 1000-4000 or 4500-4535 or any range that do not contain the current price will receive nothing. Why do it like that?  It\u2019s relatively easy to monitor that time spent inside any given range by calling snapshotCumulativesInside. Whales and market makers that actively rebalance their position already benefit by collecting a disproportionate amount of the collected trading fees. They have their cake. A more conservative position will receive as much reward as a more aggressive one, but the conservative option does not suffer IL because it won\u2019t need to be rebalanced as frequently. Easier to manage for most users. By rewarding according to the time spent \u201cin-the-money\u201d, aggressive LPs would actually receive a lower relative fraction of the rewards because the price will leave a narrowly defined range (ie. 1-tick) after small price movements whereas a wider one will remain \u201cin-the-money\u201d. Using a fixed % range may still leave pools under-liquid in case of large price moves. What\u2019s the best percentage? 20% is way too wide for DAI-USDC, but may be too narrow for ETH-WBTC. What\u2019s the best range? Even a 1-standard deviation expected price move will still be \u201cwrong\u201d 32% of the time. The fixed-range option still rewards power-users and market makers and will leave smaller LPs with a much lower reward.  But clearly, making everyone deploying to the Full-Range (which is worse than Uniswap v2 in terms of capital efficiency) would not contribute sufficient liquidity to decrease slippage, etc. What\u2019s a good limit for the maximum range? I suggest that any position whose range is chosen so that the capital efficiency is greater than 2x that of Uniswap v2 should be rewarded. By the way, the calculation for capital efficiency improvement over Uniswap v2 is: (Capital efficiency) = sqrt(r)/(sqrt(r)-1) = 1/(1-1/sqrt(r)) So a Full-range liquidity would receive zero rewards, and any liquidity whose range factor r = sqrt(upperTick/lowerTick) is smaller than r < 4 will receive liquidity mining rewards. The r < 4 criteria could be changed (a 4x price move is indeed unlikely for most assets), but r=4 LPs would still be performing 2x better than Uniswap v2. ",

Note sure what\u2019s the status of that proposal is, but I agree that one way forward could be to mandate that liquidity is deployed to a minimum \u201cfloating\u201d range \u2013 ie have the position\u2019s (upperTick-lowerTick) be larger or equal than a fixed value be centered at any price. Choosing that range could be tricky, but it could be based on the 1-std expected move. For instance, a 1-std expected move for a 100% annualize volatility after 21 days is \u00b124%. So limiting the LP range to \u00b124% would only require a rebalancing every 21 days, on average. By comparison, a 1-tick position in the 0.3% pool would need to be rebalanced every 20 minutes (clearly impossible to do unless you run bots), but successfully running this strategy would results in 34x more rewards than \u00b124% LP positions. BTW, I suggested 21 days, but the number of days could be changed to whatever according to  Expected move = (annual volatility) * sqrt(days/365)  ",

That said, the ideal use case for that approach is to taper off reliance on LM for sufficient liquidity of the protocols gov token, often when liquidity of the protocols gov token is important but not vital to the utility of the protocol (e.g. Alcx, Pendle) or when diversification of the protocols treasury and long-term holder alignment is vital to its value prop (e.g. OHM, FRAX). I think targeted LM programs on L2 for Uni in this sense is far more justified since the intent is not to create more stable liquidity for just the Uni token and align incentives with long-term holders etc but obviously rather to bootstrap liquidity for the whole ecosystem (or at least the pairs listed in the proposal) which will drive add\u2019l utility for traders to make Uni on Opt and Arb more competitive and attract users. The concerns around Uni price pressure are valid but I would also question how much demand there would be for Uni bonds in return for the pairs listed in the proposal. One easy amendment would be to take a page out of Curve/Astroport/Yearn\u2019s book and weight higher rewards towards those that lock up their liquidity for longer periods. If there was a way to do this w/ Gelato or Visor even better but I understand the concerns around add\u2019l dependency risk.

                    "content": "Uniswap governance should start incentivizing liquidity on its Arbitrum and Optimism deployments to kickstart adoption of Ethereum Layer-2. If you are not familiar with this proposal and its motivation please read the original temperature check proposal here or scroll to the bottom where I re-posted it. For the consensus check I want to address some of the most urgent questions that came up in the governance forum and on Twitter. This proposal strives to achieve two goals: I. Kickstart L2 adoption by incentivizing users to bridge and shift their activity to L2\u2019s II. Offering deep liquidity for key pairs on L2  How to execute liquidity mining on Uniswap V3 in a fair manner  Uniswap V3 is incredibly powerful but most liquidity mining programs that run on top of it don\u2019t score well on achieving a key goal of liquidity mining: distributing token ownership in a fair manner to a wide user base. Consider the Ribbon liquidity mining program pictured below: a single whale provides millions of dollars of liquidity around the spot price on one tick and rakes in all the liquidity mining rewards. This whale has enough funds to pay the gas costs for re-balancing the position every minute and so he stays always closest to the spot price. The closer LP\u2019s range is to the spot price, the more rewards they get. Even Ribbon founder Julian Koh stated publicly that the liquidity mining experiment was a failure in this regard and the only reason they hadn\u2019t stopped it was that the proposal was irreversible.  1600\u00d7653 66.5 KB  The goal of this proposal is to make participation in the liquidity mining program as easy as possible, without users having to constantly re-balance their positions and to distribute $UNI token ownership to as many users as possible. In other words, to give users who weren\u2019t able to participate in earlier liquidity mining schemes on Ethereum mainnet a chance to do it on L2. We should not only optimize for liquidity but also fairness. To achieve this I suggest modifying the Uni staker contracts to allow for fixed liquidity ranges. Instead of favouring whales who re-balance every minute around the tick, everyone within the prescribed range earns their pro-rata share of $UNI rewards. For $ETH for example, the range could be $1000/$ETH to $10,000/ETH. We would still get much better liquidity than in Uniswap V2, users wouldn\u2019t need to actively manage their liquidity and professional LP\u2019s would still have the option to actively re-balance their positions to earn more swap fees vs. the \u201cpassive\u201d LP\u2019s. We would get the best of both worlds! I considered suggesting third-party liquidity provision tools like Visor or Gelato but the overwhelming feedback I got was that:  Uniswap wouldn\u2019t want to incentivize liquidity on a third-party tool/protocol Third-parties introduce risks/vulnerabilities   Which pairs to incentivize liquidity for and what ranges to choose  To avoid any controversy and tribalism I suggest we keep the proposal as simple and exclude governance tokens of popular DeFi tokens on L2 (e.g SNX on optimism, GMX on arbitrum etc.). Instead, we can stick with the same pairs as the initial liquidity mining program: ETH/USDT (0.30%) <> $1000/ETH - $10,000/$ETH ETH/USDC (0.30%) <> $1000/ETH - $10,000/$ETH ETH/DAI (0.30%) <> $1000/ETH - $10,000/$ETH WBTC/ETH (0.30%) <> 0.045/ETH - 0.15/ETH Optional USDC- DAI (0.01% fee tier) <> 0.9999 <> 1.0001 (very successful on L1) Swap out ETH/USDT for LUSD or sUSD to strengthen decentralized stablecoins  How much $UNI to allocate and for how long should the rewards run I suggest a liquidity mining period of 3 months - long enough to make it worthwhile for users to bridge to L2\u2019s and short enough to adjust in case of major changes in the crypto landscape changes (e.g incorporate zk-Rollups in next LM program).  To calculate rewards and APR we should target a specific level of liquidity in the pools. One suggestion would be to target similar liquidity for each pair than on Ethereum mainnet. Liquidity parity between L2 and L1! Formula: TargetPoolSize * TargetAPR * RewardYears / UniPrice For example, for USDC the target pool size would be( $250m * 0.10 * 0.25)/ $20 = 321,500 $UNI ETH/USDC = 321,500 $UNI ETH/DAI = = 43,750 ETH/USDT = 68,750 ETH/WBTC = 150,000 $UNI DAI/USDC = 200,000 $UNI *2 to have this liquidity on both networks SUM = 1,567,000 $UNI  How to execute the proposal Since the Uniswap governance is on Ethereum mainnet and not on Layer-2 we need to figure out how to execute the proposal.  After consulting with @t11s I suggest two options:   Setup a one time spell that transfers UNI to a contract with only one purpose on L2 ( i.e send funds to the liquidity mining distributor)   set-up a multisig of prominent delegates on each L2 that receives the UNI and seeds the liquidity mining distributor    1600\u00d7727 151 KB  I hope this proposal satisfies the Uniswap community. I am looking forward to receiving your feedback and kickstart Layer-2 adoption!

Link to snapshot poll: https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xc1aec11c9ac5698920072a5de807284a56becbadfb7bef68b2618ad00e61547c  Uniswap governance should start incentivizing liquidity on its Arbitrum and Optimism deployments to kickstart adoption of Ethereum Layer-2 and prove that its decision to bet on Optimistic Rollups was the right one.  1200\u00d7810 144 KB  It\u2019s unfortunately a fact that the Ethereum mainnet has become unusable for normal users. As a result, many of the crypto newcomers trying DeFi for the first time are not being on-boarded on Ethereum anymore but on EVM chains like Fantom, Avalanche or other L1\u2019s altogether such as Solana. The adoption of Layer-2 networks thus far has been promising but too slow considering the competitive landscape. Three main blockers exist:   Missing Incentives Networks like Avalanche, Celo and Near are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to attract developers and users. Without a token, rollups can\u2019t revert to the same strategy. On the other hand, a lot of the Ethereum native DeFi protocols sit on billion dollar treasuries that are waiting to be deployed for productive purposes.   Missing fiat on-ramps   Without direct on-ramps onto Layer-2 networks users face high barriers before they can enjoy the benefits of these networks. These users have no other choice but to withdraw from a CEX to Ethereum to then bridge up from Ethereum to the promised land of Layer-2. On a day where fees on Ethereum mainnet are high, a user starting with $200 easily loses half of their portfolio.  Slow application migration to Layer-2\u2019s Perhaps the most surprising is how slow some protocols are to deploy on Layer-2\u2019s. This can partly be attributed to composability effects, where applications relying on other protocols to exist need to wait on their partner protocol to deploy first (e.g Ribbon \u2192 Opyn, DeFi Saver \u2192 Aave etc.). But to a large extent applications seem to take their time because the growth statistics (volumes, tvl, unique users etc.) are simply not compelling enough.  This is a typical chicken-egg problem where every party involved stands still until the other moves. Users are waiting for subsidies and more applications to use, centralized exchanges and application developers on the other hand are waiting to see user adoption first to justify the integration efforts.  800\u00d7450 345 KB  Uniswap is in a unique position to kickstart growth by launching a liquidity mining campaign on Layer-2. For one, it sits on a $11 billion dollar treasury (!!) that is currently being underutilized. Secondly, as one of the most essential money legos in the DeFi ecosystem the move would have a strong signalling power and trigger more applications to follow suit and invest resources into deploying on Layer-2. Third, the resulting liquidity and yields would set into motion a large-scale migration of users which in return has spillover effects on other factors (CEX on-ramps, devs deploying etc.) . Per Uniswap governance guidelines this forum post is merely a temperature check. Details such as the amount of rewards or the length of the liquidity mining program are better left for the Consensus check. In order to move to the next stage, this proposal needs a majority yes with a min. threshold of 25k $UNI on Snapshot. ",

                    "content": "I am fully supporting modifying the staking contract so that only fixed ranges are rewarded. However, enforcing fixed ranges is too limiting and may cause issues down the line (read my previous post discussing this here). Here\u2019s why:   First, even if 1000-10,000 look reasonable now, there is still a ~9% chance that the price will end either above 10,000 or below 1,000 after 3 months. What happens after ETH goes up by 3x and the incentivized liquidity dries up? Most liquidity will not be used, pool volume will drop, and LPs will not collect rewards.   Second, the current (1000, 10000) range is centered around sqrt(1000*10000) = 3162, meaning that users will have to deploy ~1.7x more stablecoin than ETH in absolute value when entering the position at the current price. That could cause problems because users would need to transfer 2 assets to L2 just to be able to participate.   Third, the proposed range of (1000, 10000) may be too large. While (1000, 10000) is still ~2.3x more capital efficient than Uni v2, it \u201csplits\u201d the liquidity into 384 ticks and is thus 384x less capital efficient than 1-tick liquidity. Users may feel shortchanged by being forced to use very low yield positions.   Finally, enforcing a fixed liquidity range may be counterproductive for many LPs. Users may still want to be more directional when providing liquidity or may want to re-adjust after large price moves, keeping a wide but fixed range prevents that from happening.   I suggest that the staker contract only rewards LP positions that are in range AND above a specific width (ie. upperTick - lowerTick > minWidth). In other words, allow users to choose the upper/lower bounds but limit the range to prevent 1-tickers. The value of minWidth could still be capped at the 1sd expected move for 3 months (about +/- 33%) or whatever the governance votes on. Providing liquidity in Uni v3 should not be a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d strategy, nor should it be a \u201crebalance every minute\u201d strategy either. Overall, implementing a minWidth criteria will allow users to be rewarded in a manner that is directly proportional to their amount at stake as long as their position is \u201cactive\u201d while allowing them to be strategic in their LPing. What you may not want to see happening is users \u201cforgetting\u201d about their liquidity and end up with pools with large TVLs but barely any liquidity at the current tick. Example, the ETH-MKR-0.3% pool:  Screen Shot 2021-11-30 at 10.34.57 AM2452\u00d71336 314 KB  Also, speaking of Maker, has UNI governance thought about minting Dai against their billion dollar treasury and deploy it to DAI-UNI pools on Layer 2? That would be one way to solve the stablecoin bottleneck on L2s and help provide some utility to the UNI token on layer 2 (or on Mainnet). ",

Unfortunately gas prices on L1 have made opening new troves to borrow LUSD extremely expensive and unfeasible for many smaller users, however these smaller users may still appreciate the decentralization and security of stablecoins like LUSD (particularly the users who choose Arbitrum or Optimism over other EVM L1s like BSC or AVAX) and they should be considered in a proposal like this one. Tether will surely make it\u2019s way to every L1 and L2 imaginable and there is no need for bootstrapping it with a community treasury like Uniswap\u2019s. A stablecoin like LUSD in this case would really benefit from community lead incentives given that it\u2019s governance minimalized and relies on ecosystem integrations to scale adoption. I feel like including LUSD in this proposal instead of Tether is a perfect opportunity for the Uniswap and larger Ethereum community to hit two birds with one stone; Incentivize Layer 2 adoption and make secure stablecoins that are culturally aligned with ETH users available on Optimism and Arbitrum. Thank you again Lito for creating this proposal and including LUSD as an option, I only hope the Uniswap community will make the right choice here and approve the use of a decentralized stablecoin over something like Tether so we can bring an ETH L1 native product to L2! Overall I feel like Ethereum and Uniswap users are culturally aligned with stablecoins like LUSD and RAI and we should begin including them in all L2 incentive programs to remove dependancies on centralized stablecoins like Tether and create a decentralized feedback loop for the Ethereum ecosystem. After all what\u2019s the point of using the security of Ethereum Layer2\u2019s if we are going to rely on strictly centralized products?  cheers everyone  ",

Why is optimism and arbitrum not proposing/ structuring a liquidity program for UNI governance to vote on? As this directly benefits those ecosystems.   Is this proposal still needed since polygon is working towards a Uniswap liquidity program on their L2? Users can more easily go from polygon to optimism and arbitrum.   You state an issue with large whales taking advantage of single tick, but this would also happen with a spread range. We saw these same pairs taken advantage of on the Uniswap V2 liquidity program.   Why not take advantage of a bonding program? Doesn\u2019t hop protocol do this?   The liquidity pairs should have more ethereum beneficial programs.   For example: Rai (reflexer labs): moving away from USDC fork risks RETH (rocket pool Ethereum): decentralized ethereum staking, intrest-bearing ethereum, client diversification sUSD: synthetic ecosystem I would like to emphasis point 2, if we are to fund 20+ million USD of UNI; optimism and arbitrum should step up and find a unique liquidity structure that is mutually beneficial. I.e. look at how polygon structured it\u2019s proposal. Instead of a relaunch of the same expensive v2 Uniswap liquidity program. Lets do something better\u2026 maybe a liquidity program that also helps Uniswap v3 oracles? ",

                    "content": "Thanks for posting this @litocoen - excellent work as always. For the order ranges - @guil-lambert your approach makes a ton of sense to me.  I\u2019ve struggled with the design of incentives for v3 ranges for volatile assets.  Without a third party, the best option seems to be constant adjustment (which can be very gassy for each NFT on mainnet but will be much cheaper on L2).  If @guil-lambert\u2019s approach is technically infeasible, perhaps we could approve the 3 month incentive pool but set the reward ranges on a monthly basis (3 times throughout the reward period) to target a relevant range for each monthly period. I fully support the idea of adding alternative stablecoins to this incentive pool, however I think that we should incentivize stablecoins that are actually having an impact on Uniswap.  Unless I\u2019m missing something, LUSD has $2m of liquidity on Univ3 (TVL) and even less on v2.  sUSD has $4.7m of liquidity (TVL) on v3.  Both are great projects but neither seem to be heavily invested in Uniswap at the moment.  I\u2019d love to see both projects have huge Uniswap pools on Optimism and Arbitrum but I don\u2019t see why we should incentivize them over projects that have already invested in V3.  For example, this might be a narrative violation but FRAX looks pretty obvious as the next stablecoin to add beyond USDC, USDT and DAI.  It\u2019s the #6 token on v3 by liquidity (after ETH, USDC, WBTC, DAI and USDT) with over $100m TVL.  FRAX-USDC is the #4 pair on v3 (DAI/USDC is #7).  FRAX is 2x as large as the next closest stablecoin on v3 (Paxos) and 3x the next DeFi stablecoin (FEI) and also the largest sUSD pair asset. FEI is also heavily invested in Uniswap with solid TVL and volume.  It makes a lot more sense to me to incentivize these projects as a reward for their investment in Uniswap rather than arbitrarily bootstrap other projects.  Both are crypto native projects with strong communities.  The tricky part of adding these stablecoins is what pairs do we select and how do we prevent this from getting overly complicated.  The obvious pairs from a TVL and volume perspective would be USDC/FRAX and USDC/FEI (or ETH pairs).  An alternate approach would be to add a FRAX/FEI pair for incentives, which would drive both FRAX and FEI to invest in ETH, USDC and DAI uniswap pairs (so that they can route orders through all those assets).  This might be the most bang for our buck approach - I\u2019m confident we could get both projects to build out the other pairs.  So by seeding FRAX-FEI, we could get FRAX/ETH, FRAX/USDC, FRAX/DAI and FEI/ETH, FEI/USDC and FEI/DAI for the same price.  I\u2019d be happy to reach out to both communities to get them involved if there is traction for this idea (I expect both would commit in this forum thread to building out those pairs).  Big picture - we should add another crypto native stablecoin or two to the incentives.  I\u2019d love to hear feedback on how best to do it. Overall, this is an important proposal for Uniswap but also helpful for the Ethereum community in general.  Layer 2 has taken longer than anticipated; the average consumer now has many options and they may not know or care about the differences.  Many of us within this community believe that Ethereum and L2 are the future but we also need to take steps to help realize this future.  This proposal helps kick things off.  Let\u2019s not take anything for granted going forward. ",

Full range also encourages long term passive liquidity providers and will attract v2 uniswap liquidity providers who have not switched to v3.  Full range liquidity is obscenely inefficient --as is Uni v2 for that matter ;). The Full Range option in Uniswap v3 splits the liquidity equally between all 1,774,544 ticks between MIN_TICK and MAX_TICK. In other words, it covers all possible prices from 3e-39 to 3e+38. That means capital efficiency will be >170,000 less than single-tick liquidity for the 0.05% pools. I proposed in another post that liquidity mining should incentivize a capital efficiency of at least 2x over UniV2/sushiswap. Recall that capital efficiency for a range [Pa, Pb] can be calculated as follows: C.E. = 1/(1-(Pa/Pb)^0.25) So when Pa/Pb = 1/16, the capital efficiency is 2. This corresponds to a range [K/16, K*16], where K is the midpoint of the position K=sqrt(Pa * Pb). So the range would be [300, 76000] assuming a starting price of K=4750. Since most assets won\u2019t 16x in either direction in 3 months, the C.E. = 2 may be too large. The 3 months expected move is +/-33% assuming a ~66% annualized volatility, which corresponds to a capital efficiency of 7.5x over UniV2 (nice!). The exact range could be adjusted: for example the one-month expected range would be +/-19% with a 12x increase in capital efficiency, etc. The expected move calculation predicts that the asset should remain within the prescribed range about 68% of the time. So the price will end up outside that range after 3 months about 32% of the time. This will require a rebalancing event from the LPs, but that\u2019s probably OK because gas on L2 is much cheaper. And to prevent all liquidity from becoming out-the-money at the same time, users should be to choose any midpoint K they wish. Here are some choices for users deploying to the 2 ETH worth of liquidity to the ETH-Dai-0.05% pool at +/- 33% range:   Neutral position: Deploy with K = 4750 and lock 1 ETH + 4750 Dai between [3571, 6317]   Bullish position: Use K = 6317 and lock 2 ETH between [4750, 8402]   Bearish position: Use K = 3571 and lock 7142 Dai between [2685, 4750]   Neutral-to-Bullish: Use K = 5500 and lock 1.5 ETH + 2425 Dai between [4135, 7315]  \u2026  The liquidity mining rewards will be distributed equally to all those participants as long as the price is within their prescribed range. Overall, that would still allow users some agency in how they manage their capital while still preventing LPs with ultra-narrow ranges to collect all the LM rewards. At the end of the day, rewards will be proportional to the deployed liquidity for the minTickers. Everyone\u2019s happy, except maybe the 1-tickers, but they will still collect a large fraction of the fees on their ultra-concentrated positions. ",
