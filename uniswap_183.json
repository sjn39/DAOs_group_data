            "discussion": "",
            "body": "## Proposal Topic\n\n[Blockchain at Berkeley](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu) is creating this proposal in partnership with [Nomad](https://www.docs.nomad.xyz/) to Deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam.\n\n\n## Process Update\n\nThe [Temperature Check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-moonbeam/16572) for this proposal passed with 8.3M UNI voting Yes on the [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/QmaG6nJYW3xLeQwAa6xxhpbuYS8h6PVQpbx1vfqpqxAtik). We now move to the Consensus Check phase to collect further feedback in advance of an on-chain vote.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn support of furthering the vision of [Multichain Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/multichain-uniswap), we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nMoonbeam is a Polkadot parachain which features EVM-compatibility, allowing it to serve as a port-of-entry for Ethereum-native apps to participate in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. Deploying on Moonbeam will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.\n\nMoonbeam is a reputable chain which has enjoyed high stability and considerable activity since its launch in January, making it a great fit for Uniswap\u2019s trusted brand.\n\n## About Moonbeam\n\nMoonbeam is an EVM-compatible smart contract parachain of the Polkadot network; it is optimized for cross-chain use cases and natively interoperable applications. EVM compatibility and a comprehensive tool suite of integrations like Etherscan, The Graph, Chainlink, and more, allow developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and apps to Moonbeam with minimal changes. Moonbeam also extends the EVM with native cross-chain integrations powered by [Polkadot\u2019s XCM](https://polkadot.network/blog/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format/), allowing Moonbeam apps to interact with assets and services from other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem in a trust-minimized way.\n\nMoonbeam was the first parachain to go live on the Polkadot network, launching on January 11 this year. Like Moonriver, its sister parachain on Kusama, Moonbeam is expected to accumulate developer and user activity from the [100+ projects](https://moonbeam.network/community/projects/) building DApps and protocols on the network.\n\n## Expanding Uniswap to Moonbeam\n\nWe believe that the timing is perfect for Uniswap V3 to deploy on Moonbeam. \n\nUniswap has been deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, giving it great coverage within Ethereum and its most popular L2s. However, Uniswap has not yet expanded beyond the greater Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nUnlike the other deployment targets, Moonbeam represents a much larger target market \u2014 Polkadot users. The growth potential of the Polkadot ecosystem is reflected in part by the fact that Polkadot consistently ranks in the top ecosystems for developer activity, despite having just enabled parachains auctions in December 2021. The Polkadot community has grown in parallel with the Ethereum community, and shares many of the same values \u2014 decentralization, censorship resistance, open access to finance, to name a few. However, the two communities have largely been discrete, and deploying Uniswap on Moonbeam brings them together in a meaningful way.\n\nMoonbeam is the de facto DeFi hub for Polkadot. Blue chip DeFi projects have deployed or committed to deploying to Moonbeam, including Sushiswap, Lido, Curve, Chainlink and Covalent. As the ecosystem develops, we believe that deploying Uniswap V3 will position it to become a premier AMM on Moonbeam, and, more broadly, a large liquidity hub for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. This represents a massive opportunity to capture this untapped market, which could mean significant fee revenue for LPs and UNI token holders.\n\nThe Nomad team has worked on this proposal because [Nomad and Connext](https://medium.com/connext/connext-has-partnered-with-nomad-e20cd8e62e31) have already been deployed as Moonbeam\u2019s main bridging solutions, and have begun to drive cross-chain liquidity from Ethereum into Moonbeam. By deploying Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam, Nomad would be able to route even more liquidity into Uniswap pools and additionally facilitate cross-chain communication for Uniswap governance.\n\n## Trust-Minimized Bridging and Cross-Chain Governance\n\nDecentralized cross-chain governance is a topic we are excited about working on within the Uniswap ecosystem. As Uniswap Labs highlighted in their post about [Multichain Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/multichain-uniswap), it is important that new chains have a trust-minimized arbitrary message passing solution to facilitate secure, decentralized governance of a deployment of Uniswap. The Moonbeam community already uses [Nomad](https://docs.nomad.xyz/) and [Connext](https://www.connext.network/) to bridge ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum; despite Moonbeam having only been live for two months, $35M TVL is currently bridged to Moonbeam via Nomad, with over $250M in total volume since deployment. However, Nomad is more than just a protocol for token bridging; at its core, Nomad is a protocol for trust-minimized arbitrary message passing, and Uniswap V3 deployed on Moonbeam can leverage Nomad for governance.\n\nWe have worked with developers at Uniswap Labs to research, understand, and document the current state of [cross-chain governance for Uniswap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CQWXCXdA5to7RKfVPozI8vEcw_QJrRQMP9HiQ8nbOu0/edit#heading=h.708hyjg41wlu) deployments. It became clear that, currently, cross-chain governance solutions have been patched together differently for all three of the chains that Uniswap is deployed on, leading to significant complexity and overhead for governance participants who wish to execute proposals governing deployments on other chains. This problem will multiply as Uniswap is deployed to more chains.\n\nNomad can provide an out-of-the-box solution for this problem. Nomad\u2019s own contracts are governed by a decentralized cross-chain [governance app](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo/blob/main/packages/contracts-core/contracts/governance/GovernanceRouter.sol) built on its arbitrary message passing rails. This application can be [tailored](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo/pull/95) for the purpose of governing Uniswap deployments on chains other than Ethereum mainnet. Rather than attempting to introduce this change on all chains at once, however, we can demonstrate the value of this solution in a de-risked manner by leveraging it first for a new deployment, Moonbeam.\n\n\n## Rewards and Grants\n\nAs part of this proposal, Nomad, via a grant from the Moonbeam Foundation, will commit $2,500,000 to the Uniswap Grants Program to help grow the Multichain Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nThrough collaborative discussions with members of the Uniswap community, we learned that there were likely higher-leverage ways to enrich the Uniswap community than just providing liquidity mining rewards. As Uniswap develops into a multi-chain ecosystem, we want to support developers working to create high-quality multichain apps building on-top of Uniswap, and better multichain experiences for Uniswap users. These grants will promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation towards this goal.\n\nTo borrow language from the [Uniswap Grants + Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/blog/case-study-uniswap-grants/#:~:text=Uniswap%20Grants%20gained%20access%20to,Gitcoin%20was%20founded%20in%202017) announcement, we hope for this initiative to fund \u201cbounties, hackathons, and grants\u201d for \u201cdevelopers, designers, community organizers and other web3 builders\u201d working on multi-chain projects which improve, extend, promote or build upon Unsiwap in a cross-chain manner.\n\n\nExamples of projects that could be funded with this grant include: \n- Building a cross-chain application which allows Uniswap LPs to close a position on Ethereum and open one atomically on Moonbeam\n- Improving open-source wallet softwares to create better multi-chain user experiences for Uniswap users\n- Building a frontend application which allows governance participants to more easily construct cross-chain governance proposals for Uniswap\n- Leveraging Substrate\u2019s native interoperability protocol, XCM, to build an application which composes Uniswap on Moonbeam with another substrate chain\nFunding office hours to educate new users about multichain crypto experiences\n\nWe are so excited to see what members of the Uniswap community come up with to leverage this grant!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe are excited about the possibility of the Uniswap community entering the Polkadot ecosystem via a V3 deployment on Moonbeam. To reiterate, we feel that this is a fantastic opportunity for the following reasons:\n\n- **Expansion into Polkadot**: Uniswap will be able to tap into a brand new market and all the community members in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeam\u2019s EVM-compatibility makes it simple to deploy existing Solidity code, while simultaneously providing access to other parachains using XCM. By leveraging XCM and Moonbeam\u2019s position as the DeFi hub for Polkadot, Uniswap has the opportunity to become the premier AMM across Polkadot. \n- **Trust-minimized Governance**: Per Uniswap\u2019s goal of becoming a multi-chain protocol while remaining trust-minimized, we propose using Nomad\u2019s trust-minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. This can serve as an opportunity to test this improved decentralized governance application within a safe container, with the potential of rolling it out to other V3 deployments in the future.\n- **Rewards for Uniswap Grants Program**: Instead of simply offering liquidity mining incentives, we want to fund community members working to develop and enrich multichain experiences built with Uniswap. We will commit $2.5M to the Uniswap Grants Program to fund cross-chain development deployed within the Uniswap ecosystem, in order to further expand Uniswap\u2019s multi-chain presence.\n\nWe are excited to engage with the Uniswap community and governance process to discuss more around bringing Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. Please let us know any and all feedback and criticism, so that we can improve this proposal and expand Uniswap into Moonbeam and Polkadot!",

            "discussion": "",
            "body": "### Proposal Discussion Topic\n\nThis proposal is created on behalf of Blockchain at Michigan, and in partnership with the [Celo Foundation](https://celo.org/) and the [Celo Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/).\nDeploy Uniswap V3 on Celo to Launch \u201cGreen Asset\u201d Liquidity Pools and expand access to Uniswap to the 6B smartphone users around the world\n\n### Description\nWe propose to authorize the deployment of the Uniswap protocol to Celo on behalf of the community.\n\nCelo is a mobile-first, carbon-negative, EVM-compatible blockchain. Specifically, we propose launching Uniswap on the Celo platform to:\n\n* Increase Uniswap\u2019s influence through $10M in financial incentives to Uniswap users, as well as additional grant funding provided by the Celo Foundation to utilize Uniswap as a financial building block\n* Bring Uniswap V3\u2019s increased capital efficiency to the 6B smartphone users around the world\n* Create green asset liquidity pools with natural capital backed assets such as tokenized carbon credits (e.g. MCO2 and TCO2) and future nature backed assets issued on Celo like land and forests\n* Use Uniswap as a decentralized mechanism to rebalance the Celo Reserve with nature backed assets rather than relying on centralized exchanges\n* Foster pathways for future green use cases on Uniswap\n\nOverall, we believe the Uniswap community\u2019s mission of creating a trustless and decentralized financial infrastructure accessible to anyone aligns with Celo\u2019s vision of tackling climate change and achieving prosperity for all.\n\n### About Celo\n\nCelo\u2019s mission is to build an open financial system that creates the conditions of prosperity for all. To execute this mission, Celo\u2019s technology features include:\n\n* A mobile-first EVM-compatible layer 1 blockchain that is accessible to anyone with a smartphone\n* Carbon negative by allocating 0.1% of epoch rewards to offset carbon\u2014to date, [2,942](https://www.wren.co/profile/celo) tons of carbon has been offset, [which is over 8 times Celo\u2019s carbon footprint](https://medium.com/celoorg/a-carbon-negative-blockchain-its-here-and-it-s-celo-60228de36490)\n* Algorithmic Celo stablecoins (currently cUSD, cEUR, and cREAL) with a smart-contract based expansion and contraction platform called Mento\n* An overcollateralized basket of crypto assets called the [Celo reserve](https://celoreserve.org/), currently made up of CELO, the network\u2019s native asset, as well as BTC, ETH, DAI, and MCO2\n\nCelo is one of the fastest growing DeFi ecosystems with 2.6[M addresses, up to 1.1M daily transactions, and over 103M transactions](https://thecelo.com/). Additionally, Celo [has been chosen by Kickstarter](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/08/kickstarter-to-start-blockchain-based-crowdfunding-project-report/) for its upcoming decentralized product (to date, Kickstarter has successfully supported over[ 214,000 projects with over $6B in funding and 20M backers](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats)) which will attract new users to the ecosystem\n\nThe Celo Reserve includes almost $1M of MCO2 tokens, and Celo community members have proposed to add more natural capital assets moving forward as part of the [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/). By including more natural capital assets, the Celo community has the vision of creating natural capital backed currencies. If, as a society, we were to denominate our economic activity in natural capital backed currencies, any economic growth\u2014increase in money circulation\u2014would lead to a growth in preserved natural resources. Celo aims to be the layer 1 blockchain for natural capital assets, and Uniswap can be the natural capital DEX for these assets on Celo.\n\n### Proposal\n\nBlockchain technology can help address limit greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable practices by tokenizing carbon-sequestering assets such as rainforests. Those tokenized assets can then be purchased by individuals and businesses to democratize carbon offsetting and increase funding for environmental protection projects. We believe that together, Uniswap and Celo can lead the path to growing natural capital assets.\n\nUniswap on the Celo platform will:\n\n* Allow for the launch of green asset liquidity pools: With the launch of the [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/), Celo community members proposed to allocate up to 40% of the reserve over time towards natural capital backed assets. A natural capital backed asset (also known as \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cregenerative finance\u201d asset) is a tokenized representation of natural assets in the \u201creal\u201d world. An example of a green asset is a non-fungible carbon-negative initiative quantified in terms of fungible CO2 sequestered (e.g. tokenized carbon credits).\n* Advance the use of natural capital backed currencies: The Celo Reserve grows as demand for Celo stable currencies grows. And as the reserve grows, so does the allocation towards green assets. This creates a feedback mechanism: with increased adoption of Celo stable currencies the reserve programmatically generates demand for additional green assets, preserving rainforests, and other carbon-sequestering assets.\n* Use Uniswap as a decentralized mechanism to rebalance the reserve: The Celo reserve will not only need to rebalance its BTC, ETH, etc. holdings but also a variety of natural capital backed assets, such as tokenized land, forests, and carbon credits. If approved by Celo\u2019s community governance, a 40% allocation at current reserve values would correspond to natural capital assets worth 200M USD held by the reserve alone, requiring an efficient and liquid trading counterpart. Currently, the reserve rebalances via centralized exchanges. Green assets are not held by centralized exchanges, and so a decentralized exchange is needed in order to rebalance the Celo reserve as demand for stable currencies increases.\n* Increase capital efficiency: Uniswap v3\u2019s concentrated liquidity mechanism will be especially important for Celo\u2019s stablecoins that trade within a small price range.\n* Create pathways for future green use cases: Market participants are actively exploring other use cases on Celo.

                    "content": " Governance Proposal Link (submit by 4/28 6:49pm EDT)  Summary: Dear Uniswap community, A few weeks ago we (Blockchain at Michigan in partnership with the Celo Foundation and the Celo Climate Collective) submitted a proposal to deploy Uniswap V3 on Celo to launch \u201cGreen Asset\u201d Liquidity Pools and expand access to Uniswap to the 6B smartphone users around the world. We initiated the Temperature Check and Consensus Check on Snapshot, where the proposal received strong support from the Uniswap community (~100%) voted yes for the proposal. Before putting forth the formal on-chain governance proposal, we wanted to ensure we worked closely with Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap community to put forth clear documentation on the cross-chain governance bridging. We believe this proposal is a first step in a long and fruitful collaboration between the Celo and Uniswap communities\u2014a journey we are particularly excited to embark on. We\u2019re excited to initiate the formal governance proposal. We\u2019d love to receive your support in this proposal. NOTE: Based on community feedback and conversations with Uniswap Labs we\u2019re also adding the following items in the proposal since the consensus check version. This serves to add additional transparency mechanisms to the proposal based on what has been a highly engaging process with the Uniswap community, well as provide more information on the deployment itself:  Up to 1% of the $10M in financial incentives ($100K) will be directed towards funding an investigation into Uniswap protocol\u2019s climate impact, followed by a (potentially partial) mitigation phase. This funding will be part of the portion of financial incentives placed in a multisig (approximately one-third of the $10M) with 2-4 key members of the Uniswap community, including both individuals and institutions. The Celo Foundation will provide quarterly/semi-annual updates through Mirror or another source that is preferred on the incentive program, including stats of use of funds and overall impact Governance at deployment will be facilitated by messaging bridge Optics. We\u2019ve added additional technical information regarding the Optics bridge below after discussing with Uniswap Labs and reviewing this forum post to ensure that the messaging bridge meets appropriate security standards.  Temperature check discussion Consensus check discussion  Updated Proposal: Deploy Uniswap V3 on Celo to Launch \u201cGreen Asset\u201d Liquidity Pools and expand access to Uniswap to the 6B smartphone users around the world  Description: In partnership with the Celo Foundation and the Celo Climate Collective, we propose to authorize the deployment of the Uniswap protocol to Celo on behalf of the community. Celo is a mobile-first, carbon-negative, EVM-compatible blockchain. Specifically, we propose launching Uniswap on the Celo platform to:  Increase Uniswap\u2019s presence through $10M in financial incentives to Uniswap users, as well as additional grant funding provided by the Celo Foundation to utilize Uniswap as a financial building block Bring Uniswap V3\u2019s increased capital efficiency to the 6B smartphone users around the world Create green asset liquidity pools with natural capital backed assets such as tokenized carbon credits (e.g. MCO2, TCO2, and GNT) and future nature backed assets issued on Celo like land and forests Use Uniswap as a decentralized mechanism to rebalance the Celo Reserve with nature backed assets rather than relying on centralized exchanges Foster pathways for future green use cases on Uniswap  Overall, we believe the Uniswap community\u2019s mission of creating a trustless and decentralized financial infrastructure accessible to anyone aligns with Celo\u2019s vision of tackling climate change and achieving prosperity for all.  About Celo: Celo\u2019s mission is to build an open financial system that creates the conditions of prosperity for all. To execute this mission, Celo\u2019s technology features include:  A mobile-first EVM-compatible layer 1 blockchain that is accessible to anyone with a smartphone Carbon negative by allocating 0.1% of epoch rewards to offset carbon\u2014to date, 3,007 tons of carbon has been offset, which is over 8 times Celo\u2019s carbon footprint  Algorithmic Celo stablecoins (currently cUSD, cEUR, and cREAL) with a smart-contract based expansion and contraction platform called Mento An overcollateralized basket of crypto assets called the Celo reserve, currently made up of CELO, the network\u2019s native asset, as well as BTC, ETH, DAI, and MCO2  Celo is one of the fastest growing DeFi ecosystems with 2.8M addresses, up to 1.1M daily transactions, and over 111M transactions. Additionally, Celo has been chosen by Kickstarter for its upcoming decentralized product (to date, Kickstarter has successfully supported over 214,000 projects with over $6B in funding and 20M backers) which will attract new users to the ecosystem. The Celo Reserve includes almost $1M of MCO2 tokens, and Celo community members have proposed to add more natural capital assets moving forward as part of the Climate Collective. By including more natural capital assets, the Celo community has the vision of creating natural capital backed currencies. If, as a society, we were to denominate our economic activity in natural capital backed currencies, any economic growth\u2014increase in money circulation\u2014would lead to a growth in preserved natural resources. Celo aims to be the layer 1 blockchain for natural capital assets, and Uniswap can be the natural capital DEX for these assets on Celo.  Proposal Blockchain technology can help address greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable practices by tokenizing carbon-sequestering assets such as rainforests. Those tokenized assets can then be purchased by individuals and businesses to democratize carbon offsetting and increase funding for environmental protection projects. We believe that together, Uniswap and Celo can lead the path to growing natural capital assets. Uniswap on the Celo platform will:  Allow for the launch of green asset liquidity pools: With the launch of the Climate Collective, Celo community members proposed to allocate up to 40% of the reserve over time towards natural capital backed assets. A natural capital backed asset (also known as \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cregenerative finance\u201d asset) is a tokenized representation of natural assets in the \u201creal\u201d world. An example of a green asset is a non-fungible carbon-negative initiative quantified in terms of fungible CO2 sequestered (e.g. tokenized carbon credits). Advance the use of natural capital backed currencies: The Celo Reserve grows as demand for Celo stable currencies grows. And as the reserve grows, so does the allocation towards green assets. This creates a feedback mechanism: with increased adoption of Celo stable currencies the reserve programmatically generates demand for additional green assets, preserving rainforests, and other carbon-sequestering assets. Use Uniswap as a decentralized mechanism to rebalance the reserve: The Celo reserve will not only need to rebalance its BTC, ETH, etc. holdings but also a variety of natural capital backed assets, such as tokenized land, forests, and carbon credits. If approved by Celo\u2019s community governance, a 40% allocation at current reserve values would correspond to natural capital assets worth 200M USD held by the reserve alone, requiring an efficient and liquid trading counterpart. Currently, the reserve rebalances via centralized exchanges. Green assets are not held by centralized exchanges, and so a decentralized exchange is needed in order to rebalance the Celo reserve as demand for stable currencies increases. Increase capital efficiency: Uniswap v3\u2019s concentrated liquidity mechanism will be especially important for Celo\u2019s stablecoins that trade within a small price range. Create pathways for future green use cases: Market participants are actively exploring other use cases on Celo. A list of current projects is available on https://climatecollective.org/.  The Celo Foundation will commit $10M of CELO in Uniswap-specific user incentives & grants on Celo. The Celo Foundation has successfully delivered committed rewards in the past (e.g. Sushi) and intends to do so in this instance as well. As a good faith deposit, approximately one-third of the $10M of financial incentives to Uniswap users for green asset pools will be placed in a multisig with the Celo Foundation and 2-4 key members of the Uniswap community, including both individuals and institutions. Of the incentives placed in the multisig, up to 1% of the $10M in financial incentives ($100K) will be directed towards funding an investigation into Uniswap protocol\u2019s climate impact, followed by a (potentially partial) mitigation phase. In addition to the $10M in financial incentives for Uniswap specifically, the Celo Foundation will also focus on broader adoption of natural capital backed currencies and link this to ongoing efforts to making DeFi and crypto more accessible to the 6B smartphone users around the world through the following:   Promote the development of a mobile-first ecosystem through developer programs such as hackathons with Uniswap as a financial building block   Lead pilots and user research to help make Uniswap more accessible, especially in markets that lack access to basic financial tools and services.   Co-grant program to support projects that are launching and driving the growth of \u201cgreen assets\u201d   Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Celo by the Celo Foundation or cLabs through the \u201cDeploy Uniswap V3 Script.\u201d contingent upon approval by the Uniswap community for a license exemption. Governance at deployment will be facilitated by the messaging bridge Optics. See below for additional information regarding the Optics bridge.  Bridge Overview: Optics is a generalized message passing protocol inspired by optimistic roll ups and other optimistic systems. At a high level, the Optics protocol works by utilizing a network of agents to observe and attest to messages on a source chain and relay those attestations to a destination chain, where they are accepted as valid after a 30 minute fraud window. During that window, an application\u2019s \u201cwatchers\u201d can disconnect it from the protocol if fraudulent attestations have been detected\u2026 You can read more about Optics here. More info on the Optics protocol security:  Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? Yes. The Optics bridge supports generalized message passing for all supported chains. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? Applications using Optics are secured by a set of watchers, responsible for detecting fraud in the network. Only one Watcher needs to be honest in order for the application to be safe. Watchers currently include a combination of key protocols on Celo and Celo validators. While the bridge itself is not secured by a multisig, key contract deployments are owned by a 4 of 7 multisig, with signers from the Celo community. In alphabetical order, the signers are:  Celo Foundation: 0xa725898D6F73C512f803B564A89DFbd96cF298EC Celo Wallet: 0xeE2b1e23e71052860C14f69E84AAF78478606D63 Censusworks: 0x7519Db53B63d72721470319A5F4462D587Bb3008 cLabs: 0xd85DC9A21378EF738A248236E970c2e0be89C9c2 Mobius: 0x63c079444e07D82d33399DE7D56d6E48740494c7 Moola: 0x7d7cd2ED526F99D05A05a93CCf42C1ADdBe78552 Ubeswap: 0xFCcD3516d6BB62b009088aDae1E349430dDF6e77    The multisigs are deployed at the following addresses:   Celo: 0x070c2843402Aa0637ae0F2E2edf601aAB5E72509 (Celo Safe 31)   Ethereum: 0x2bb2a5a724170357cb691841f40d26a950d8c33d (Gnosis Safe 12)   Polygon: 0x8A1405C70c8a45177b5ac71b1d22779272E5d48b (Gnosis Safe 12)   Avalanche: 0x8a11d528d12ea09ccbf86e21B7813812b53a6900 (Pangolin Safe 7)   Does the bridge leverage the security of the source or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity? Optics leverages two sources of security, the updater, responsible for signing message attestations, and the \u2018Watchers\u2019, which watch for fraudulent attestations by the updater. Watchers for the Uniswap governance bridge deployment will include 5 to 10 Celo validators and contributors to key protocols on Celo. Currently, 9 groups representing key protocols on Celo or current Celo validators have expressed that they can set up a watcher for the Uniswap governance bridge.   Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? In the event all watchers are byzantine, a malicious or compromised updater can result in fraudulent messages being passed to the destination chain. If even a single watcher is honest, the application will be disconnected from Optics before any fraudulent messages can be processed.   What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? In the current state, Optics Updaters, which are the actors that could behave in a malicious manner to the detriment of the system, are not bonded. In the event they were bonded, their malicious behavior would result in their bond being slashed upon a fraud proof submitted by a Watcher.   Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?  Optics Smart Contracts were audited, with the results published here. The audit found no critical vulnerabilities, 2 \u2018medium\u2019 issues, and 10 \u2018low\u2019 issues. Where issues were substantive, patches were made prior to mainnet deployment.    While Optics will be fully sufficient for the needs of the deployment and ensure appropriate governance messaging as discussed with the Uniswap Labs team, we believe that it will be in the best interest of the Uniswap community to eventually migrate to Abacus, a new generalized cross-chain communication protocol inspired by and built upon the foundations of Optics. In this sense, Optics shall be used as a bridge into a future Abacus deployment, that can be decided upon through a future governance proposal to the Uniswap community. Similar to this process for Uniswap v3 deployment, we\u2019re happy to work closely with the Uniswap community to make sure any changes to the governance bridge addresses cross-bridge governance needs. Abacus is expected to launch on major EVM testnets by early May, and mainnets by June and will not require a re-deployment of Uniswap v3 on Celo. Abacus will be API compatible with Optics, and will have significantly improved security guarantees. You can read more about Abacus here, but for high level security implementation details we provide the following info regarding protocol security:  Does the protocol support arbitrary message passing? Yes. The Abacus protocol supports generalized message passing for all supported chains. Is the protocol secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? Abacus will be secured by a set of validators utilizing a proof of stake incentive mechanism. Does the protocol leverage the security of the source or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity? Abacus leverages two sources of security, a decentralized validator set secured by proof-of-stake on the source chain, responsible for signing message attestations, and \u201csovereign consensus\u201d, which allows for the provision of application-specific security rules. You can read more about \u201csovereign consensus\u201d here. Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so are there any recall mechanisms? While theoretically possible, it is unlikely given the multiple layers of defense. A quorum of validators would have to attest to a fraudulent message, for which they would be slashed, and an application\u2019s sovereign validators would have to accept the message. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Validators that sign fraudulent messages will have their stake slashed.  Measurement Overall, we propose a transparent measurement of this project\u2019s success through the following success criteria and long-term goals:  % of Celo Reserve allocated to green assets: 40% of the Celo Reserve (at current Celo Reserve levels this would correspond to $200M USD in green assets) $ total TVL and TVL of associated green assets: 10x of Celo Reserve green asset holdings in circulation as LP Impact of green assets in Celo Reserve: 17M tons of CO2 avoided or removed from the atmosphere (assuming an average price of $12 per ton and current Celo Reserve levels) , including all associated benefits (e.g. increase in biodiversity through protection of forests). This corresponds roughly to the annual absorption capacity of 1.7M hectares of forest area, or roughly the amount of forest area lost in Brazil in 2020.  License Exemption We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow the Celo Foundation and cLabs (Celo) to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Celo, a layer 1 EVM compatible blockchain, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Celo by the Celo Foundation or cLabs through the \u201cDeploy Uniswap V3 Script.\u201d Celo would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work. Timeline We anticipate deployment of the smart contracts on Celo to take a few weeks. Additionally, Uniswap Labs has noted that they will need to complete some front-end updates and add Celo to the auto router\u2014this will take ~4 weeks and they are prepared to ramp up following Uniswap community approval of this governance proposal. Governance at deployment will be facilitated by the messaging bridge Optics. This deployment of the Uniswap governance application will take approximately 1 week\u2014to be done simultaneously during the steps detailed above.  Conclusion Celo and Uniswap together can serve as the foundation for the proliferation of natural capital assets across Web3. We believe that the vision to advance climate and regenerative finance on Celo aligns with the Uniswap community. Thank you for your consideration and we welcome questions and suggestions. Additional note: Robert Leifke and Kyle Scott, members of Blockchain at Michigan, are co-founders of Mobius, a Celo stableswap protocol. To avoid any conflicts of interest, they have had no involvement in this partnership between Blockchain at Michigan and the Celo Foundation.

Voting Links Voting for the on-chain Governance Proposal will go Live on May 12th.  Vote with Tally   Vote with  Uniswap App    Past Proposal Links  Consensus Check: discussion, snapshot (passed with 9.6M UNI in favor) Temperature Check: discussion, snapshot (passed with 8.3M UNI in favor)   Summary In support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap, we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain which features EVM-compatibility, allowing it to serve as a port-of-entry for Ethereum-native apps to participate in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. Deploying on Moonbeam will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world. The timeline for deployment will be approximately 3-4 weeks following the Governance Proposal, with contract deployment being handled by the Nomad team.  About Moonbeam Moonbeam is an EVM-compatible smart contract parachain of the Polkadot network; it is optimized for cross-chain use cases and natively interoperable applications. EVM compatibility and a comprehensive tool suite of integrations like Etherscan, The Graph, Chainlink, and more, allow developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and apps to Moonbeam with minimal changes. Moonbeam also extends the EVM with native cross-chain integrations powered by Polkadot\u2019s XCM, allowing Moonbeam apps to interact with assets and services from other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem in a trust-minimized way. Moonbeam is live on mainnet, and was the first parachain to go live on the Polkadot network, launching on January 11 this year. Like Moonriver, its sister parachain on Kusama, Moonbeam is expected to accumulate developer and user activity from the 100+ projects building DApps and protocols on the network.  Proposal We believe that the timing is perfect for Uniswap V3 to deploy on Moonbeam. Uniswap has been deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, giving it great coverage within Ethereum and its most popular L2s. However, Uniswap has not yet expanded beyond the greater Ethereum ecosystem. Unlike the other deployment targets, Moonbeam represents a much larger target market \u2014 Polkadot users. The growth potential of the Polkadot ecosystem is reflected in part by the fact that Polkadot consistently ranks in the top ecosystems for developer activity, despite having just enabled parachains auctions in December 2021. The Polkadot community has grown in parallel with the Ethereum community, and shares many of the same values \u2014 decentralization, censorship resistance, open access to finance, to name a few. However, the two communities have largely been discrete, and deploying Uniswap on Moonbeam brings them together in a meaningful way. Moonbeam is the de facto DeFi hub for Polkadot. Blue chip DeFi projects have deployed or committed to deploying to Moonbeam, including Sushiswap, Lido, Curve, Chainlink and Covalent. As the ecosystem develops, we believe that deploying Uniswap V3 will position it to become a premier AMM on Moonbeam, and, more broadly, a large liquidity hub for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. This represents a massive opportunity to capture this untapped market, which could mean significant fee revenue for LPs and UNI token holders.  Rewards and Grants As part of this proposal, the Moonbeam Foundation will commit $2,500,000 to the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) to help grow the Multichain Uniswap ecosystem. Through collaborative discussions with members of the Uniswap community, we learned that there were likely higher-leverage ways to enrich the Uniswap community than just providing liquidity mining rewards. As Uniswap develops into a multi-chain ecosystem, we want to support developers working to create high-quality multichain apps built on-top of Uniswap, and better multichain experiences for Uniswap users. These grants will promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation towards this goal. To borrow language from the Uniswap Grants + Gitcoin announcement, we hope for this initiative to fund \u201cbounties, hackathons, and grants\u201d for \u201cdevelopers, designers, community organizers and other web3 builders\u201d working on multi-chain projects which improve, extend, promote or build upon Unsiwap in a cross-chain manner. Examples of projects that could be funded with this grant include: Building a cross-chain application which allows Uniswap LPs to close a position on Ethereum and open one atomically on Moonbeam Improving open-source wallet softwares to create better multi-chain user experiences for Uniswap users Building a frontend application which allows governance participants to more easily construct cross-chain governance proposals for Uniswap Leveraging Substrate\u2019s native interoperability protocol, XCM, to build an application which composes Uniswap on Moonbeam with another substrate chain Funding office hours to educate new users about multichain crypto experiences In terms of the delivery of funds, the Moonbeam Foundation commits to allocating the agreed amount of funding to teams referred by UGP to the Moonbeam Foundation. The delivery of the grant funds from the Moonbeam Foundation shall be subject to delivery conditions including the grant recipient\u2019s agreement to the Foundation\u2019s terms and AML and KYC procedures.  Trust-Minimized Bridging and Cross-Chain Governance Decentralized cross-chain governance is the cherry on top that we are excited about working on within the Uniswap ecosystem. As Uniswap Labs highlighted in their post about Multichain Uniswap, it is important that new chains have a trust-minimized arbitrary message passing solution to facilitate secure, decentralized governance of a deployment of Uniswap. We have worked with developers at Uniswap Labs to research, understand, and document the current state of cross-chain governance for Uniswap deployments. We have learned that, currently, cross-chain governance solutions have been patched together differently for all three of the chains that Uniswap is deployed on, leading to significant complexity and overhead for governance participants who wish to execute proposals governing deployments on other chains. This problem will multiply as Uniswap is deployed to more chains. In order to address this issue, Nomad and Gnosis have partnered to create a Gnosis Zodiac module called Gnomad that enables cross-chain governance of Uniswap deployments on chains other than Ethereum mainnet. This module enables any chain with Gnosis Safe deployed to receive cross-chain messages from Uniswap\u2019s Governor Bravo contract. Nomad uses an optimistic mechanism for security, relying on updaters that verify cross-chain messages and off-chain watchers that flag fraud \u2013 only one honest watcher is required to secure the system. The Nomad team has worked on this proposal because Nomad and Connext have already been deployed as Moonbeam\u2019s main bridging solutions. By deploying Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam, Nomad would be able to route liquidity into Uniswap pools and facilitate cross-chain communication for Uniswap governance. The core contracts for Nomad have been previously audited, and we are currently in the process of re-auditing new commits including the Gnosis Zodiac module for cross-chain governance. The audit is being conducted by Quantstamp, and expected to complete by early May. We will wait for this re-audit to be finished before we deploy on-chain.  License Exemption We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow Illusory Systems, Inc. (DBA Nomad) to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Moonbeam, a Layer 1 blockchain in the Polkadot ecosystem with EVM compatibility, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Moonbeam by Nomad through the \u201cDeploy Uniswap V3 Script.\u201d Nomad would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.  Timeline Following the Governance Proposal, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap V3 deployment on Moonbeam. We anticipate that full deployment will take 3-4 weeks, consisting of:  Finishing audit of Gnomad module that will facilitate governance on Moonbeam Deploying Uniswap V3 smart contracts on Moonbeam   Conclusion We are excited about the possibility of the Uniswap community entering the Polkadot ecosystem via a V3 deployment on Moonbeam. To reiterate, we feel that this is a fantastic opportunity for the following reasons:   Expansion into Polkadot: Uniswap will be able to tap into a brand new market and all the community members in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeam\u2019s EVM-compatibility makes it simple to deploy existing Solidity code, while simultaneously providing access to other parachains using XCM. By leveraging XCM and Moonbeam\u2019s position as the DeFi hub for Polkadot, Uniswap has the opportunity to become the premier AMM across Polkadot.  Trust-minimized Governance: Per Uniswap\u2019s goal of becoming a multi-chain protocol while remaining trust-minimized, we propose using Nomad\u2019s trust-minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. This can serve as an opportunity to test this improved decentralized governance application within a safe container, with the potential of rolling it out to other V3 deployments in the future.  Rewards for Uniswap Grants Program: Instead of simply offering liquidity mining incentives, we want to fund community members working to develop and enrich multichain experiences built with Uniswap. The Moonbeam Foundation will commit $2.5M to the Uniswap Grants Program to fund cross-chain development deployed within the Uniswap ecosystem, in order to further expand Uniswap\u2019s multi-chain presence.  We are excited to work with the Uniswap community to bring Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam!

This proposal serves to expand the use of Uniswap v3, as well as support cross-chain ecosystems. First of all, the potential for fee revenue growth seems enticing, given the significant additional capacity that a user-base expansion to a non-Ethereum blockchain would bring about. Moreover, the pledged grant supports initiating possible cross-chain capability-enabling research which would significantly benefit the Uniswap community if implemented. Lastly, cross-chain governance is an interesting point \u2013certainly essential for future-proofing the entire community\u2013 and would likely need further examination; the proposal supports the unification of cross-chain governance under a radically different mechanism than the current one, namely using Nomad message passing channels, which would merit some concern and careful supplementary consideration from experts before its final implementation and deployment.

                    "content": " Proposal Discussion Topic Nomad is creating this proposal in partnership with Blockchain at Berkeley to Deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam.  Summary In support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap, we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem. Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain which features EVM-compatibility, allowing it to serve as a port-of-entry for Ethereum-native apps to participate in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. Deploying on Moonbeam will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world. Moonbeam is a reputable chain which has enjoyed high stability and considerable activity since its launch in January, making it a great fit for Uniswap\u2019s trusted brand.  About Moonbeam Moonbeam is an EVM-compatible smart contract parachain of the Polkadot network; it is optimized for cross-chain use cases and natively interoperable applications. EVM compatibility and a comprehensive tool suite of integrations like Etherscan, The Graph, Chainlink, and more, allow developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and apps to Moonbeam with minimal changes. Moonbeam also extends the EVM with native cross-chain integrations powered by Polkadot\u2019s XCM, allowing Moonbeam apps to interact with assets and services from other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem in a trust-minimized way. Moonbeam was the first parachain to go live on the Polkadot network, launching on January 11 this year. Like Moonriver, its sister parachain on Kusama, Moonbeam is expected to accumulate developer and user activity from the 100+ projects building DApps and protocols on the network.  Expanding Uniswap to Moonbeam We believe that the timing is perfect for Uniswap V3 to deploy on Moonbeam. Uniswap has been deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, giving it great coverage within Ethereum and its most popular L2s. However, Uniswap has not yet expanded beyond the greater Ethereum ecosystem. Unlike the other deployment targets, Moonbeam represents a much larger target market \u2014 Polkadot users. The growth potential of the Polkadot ecosystem is reflected in part by the fact that Polkadot consistently ranks in the top ecosystems for developer activity, despite having just enabled parachains auctions in December 2021. The Polkadot community has grown in parallel with the Ethereum community, and shares many of the same values \u2014 decentralization, censorship resistance, open access to finance, to name a few. However, the two communities have largely been discrete, and deploying Uniswap on Moonbeam brings them together in a meaningful way. Moonbeam is the de facto DeFi hub for Polkadot. Blue chip DeFi projects have deployed or committed to deploying to Moonbeam, including Sushiswap, Lido, Curve, Chainlink and Covalent. As the ecosystem develops, we believe that deploying Uniswap V3 will position it to become a premier AMM on Moonbeam, and, more broadly, a large liquidity hub for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. This represents a massive opportunity to capture this untapped market, which could mean significant fee revenue for LPs and UNI token holders. The Nomad team has worked on this proposal because Nomad and Connext have already been deployed as Moonbeam\u2019s main bridging solutions, and have begun to drive cross-chain liquidity from Ethereum into Moonbeam. By deploying Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam, Nomad would be able to route even more liquidity into Uniswap pools and additionally facilitate cross-chain communication for Uniswap governance.  Trust-Minimized Bridging and Cross-Chain Governance Decentralized cross-chain governance is a topic we are excited about working on within the Uniswap ecosystem. As Uniswap Labs highlighted in their post about Multichain Uniswap, it is important that new chains have a trust-minimized arbitrary message passing solution to facilitate secure, decentralized governance of a deployment of Uniswap. The Moonbeam community already uses Nomad and Connext to bridge ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum; despite Moonbeam having only been live for two months, $35M TVL is currently bridged to Moonbeam via Nomad, with over $250M in total volume since deployment. However, Nomad is more than just a protocol for token bridging; at its core, Nomad is a protocol for trust-minimized arbitrary message passing, and Uniswap V3 deployed on Moonbeam can leverage Nomad for governance. We have worked with developers at Uniswap Labs to research, understand, and document the current state of cross-chain governance for Uniswap deployments. It became clear that, currently, cross-chain governance solutions have been patched together differently for all three of the chains that Uniswap is deployed on, leading to significant complexity and overhead for governance participants who wish to execute proposals governing deployments on other chains. This problem will multiply as Uniswap is deployed to more chains. Nomad can provide an out-of-the-box solution for this problem. Nomad\u2019s own contracts are governed by a decentralized cross-chain governance app built on its arbitrary message passing rails. This application can be tailored for the purpose of governing Uniswap deployments on chains other than Ethereum mainnet. Rather than attempting to introduce this change on all chains at once, however, we can demonstrate the value of this solution in a de-risked manner by leveraging it first for a new deployment, Moonbeam.  Rewards and Grants As part of this proposal, Nomad, via a grant from the Moonbeam Foundation, will commit $2,500,000 to the Uniswap Grants Program to help grow the Multichain Uniswap ecosystem. Through collaborative discussions with members of the Uniswap community, we learned that there were likely higher-leverage ways to enrich the Uniswap community than just providing liquidity mining rewards. As Uniswap develops into a multi-chain ecosystem, we want to support developers working to create high-quality multichain apps building on-top of Uniswap, and better multichain experiences for Uniswap users. These grants will promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation towards this goal. To borrow language from the Uniswap Grants + Gitcoin announcement, we hope for this initiative to fund \u201cbounties, hackathons, and grants\u201d for \u201cdevelopers, designers, community organizers and other web3 builders\u201d working on multi-chain projects which improve, extend, promote or build upon Unsiwap in a cross-chain manner. Examples of projects that could be funded with this grant include:  Building a cross-chain application which allows Uniswap LPs to close a position on Ethereum and open one atomically on Moonbeam Improving open-source wallet softwares to create better multi-chain user experiences for Uniswap users Building a frontend application which allows governance participants to more easily construct cross-chain governance proposals for Uniswap Leveraging Substrate\u2019s native interoperability protocol, XCM, to build an application which composes Uniswap on Moonbeam with another substrate chain Funding office hours to educate new users about multichain crypto experiences  We are so excited to see what members of the Uniswap community come up with to leverage this grant!  Conclusion We are excited about the possibility of the Uniswap community entering the Polkadot ecosystem via a V3 deployment on Moonbeam. To reiterate, we feel that this is a fantastic opportunity for the following reasons:   Expansion into Polkadot: Uniswap will be able to tap into a brand new market and all the community members in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeam\u2019s EVM-compatibility makes it simple to deploy existing Solidity code, while simultaneously providing access to other parachains using XCM. By leveraging XCM and Moonbeam\u2019s position as the DeFi hub for Polkadot, Uniswap has the opportunity to become the premier AMM across Polkadot.  Trust-minimized Governance: Per Uniswap\u2019s goal of becoming a multi-chain protocol while remaining trust-minimized, we propose using Nomad\u2019s trust-minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. This can serve as an opportunity to test this improved decentralized governance application within a safe container, with the potential of rolling it out to other V3 deployments in the future.  Rewards for Uniswap Grants Program: Instead of simply offering liquidity mining incentives, we want to fund community members working to develop and enrich multichain experiences built with Uniswap. We will commit $2.5M to the Uniswap Grants Program to fund cross-chain development deployed within the Uniswap ecosystem, in order to further expand Uniswap\u2019s multi-chain presence.  We are excited to engage with the Uniswap community and governance process to discuss more around bringing Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. Please let us know any and all feedback and criticism, so that we can improve this proposal and expand Uniswap into Moonbeam and Polkadot! Link to snapshot: Snapshot ",

Link to temperature check governance forum post: Temperature Check Link to snapshot poll: Snapshot  Yes - Deploy Uniswap v3 to Moonbeam No - Make no change   Proposal Topic Blockchain at Berkeley is creating this proposal in partnership with Nomad to Deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam.  Summary In support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap, we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem. Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain which features EVM-compatibility, allowing it to serve as a port-of-entry for Ethereum-native apps to participate in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. Deploying on Moonbeam will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world. Moonbeam is a reputable chain which has enjoyed high stability and considerable activity since its launch in January, making it a great fit for Uniswap\u2019s trusted brand.  About Moonbeam Moonbeam is an EVM-compatible smart contract parachain of the Polkadot network; it is optimized for cross-chain use cases and natively interoperable applications. EVM compatibility and a comprehensive tool suite of integrations like Etherscan, The Graph, Chainlink, and more, allow developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and apps to Moonbeam with minimal changes. Moonbeam also extends the EVM with native cross-chain integrations powered by Polkadot\u2019s XCM, allowing Moonbeam apps to interact with assets and services from other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem in a trust-minimized way. Moonbeam was the first parachain to go live on the Polkadot network, launching on January 11 this year. Like Moonriver, its sister parachain on Kusama, Moonbeam is expected to accumulate developer and user activity from the 100+ projects building DApps and protocols on the network.  Expanding Uniswap to Moonbeam We believe that the timing is perfect for Uniswap V3 to deploy on Moonbeam. Uniswap has been deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, giving it great coverage within Ethereum and its most popular L2s. However, Uniswap has not yet expanded beyond the greater Ethereum ecosystem. Unlike the other deployment targets, Moonbeam represents a much larger target market \u2014 Polkadot users. The growth potential of the Polkadot ecosystem is reflected in part by the fact that Polkadot consistently ranks in the top ecosystems for developer activity, despite having just enabled parachains auctions in December 2021. The Polkadot community has grown in parallel with the Ethereum community, and shares many of the same values \u2014 decentralization, censorship resistance, open access to finance, to name a few. However, the two communities have largely been discrete, and deploying Uniswap on Moonbeam brings them together in a meaningful way. Moonbeam is the de facto DeFi hub for Polkadot. Blue chip DeFi projects have deployed or committed to deploying to Moonbeam, including Sushiswap, Lido, Curve, Chainlink and Covalent. As the ecosystem develops, we believe that deploying Uniswap V3 will position it to become a premier AMM on Moonbeam, and, more broadly, a large liquidity hub for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. This represents a massive opportunity to capture this untapped market, which could mean significant fee revenue for LPs and UNI token holders. The Nomad team has worked on this proposal because Nomad and Connext have already been deployed as Moonbeam\u2019s main bridging solutions, and have begun to drive cross-chain liquidity from Ethereum into Moonbeam. By deploying Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam, Nomad would be able to route even more liquidity into Uniswap pools and additionally facilitate cross-chain communication for Uniswap governance.  Trust-Minimized Bridging and Cross-Chain Governance Decentralized cross-chain governance is a topic we are excited about working on within the Uniswap ecosystem. As Uniswap Labs highlighted in their post about Multichain Uniswap, it is important that new chains have a trust-minimized arbitrary message passing solution to facilitate secure, decentralized governance of a deployment of Uniswap. The Moonbeam community already uses Nomad and Connext to bridge ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum; despite Moonbeam having only been live for two months, $35M TVL is currently bridged to Moonbeam via Nomad, with over $250M in total volume since deployment. However, Nomad is more than just a protocol for token bridging; at its core, Nomad is a protocol for trust-minimized arbitrary message passing, and Uniswap V3 deployed on Moonbeam can leverage Nomad for governance. We have worked with developers at Uniswap Labs to research, understand, and document the current state of cross-chain governance for Uniswap deployments. It became clear that, currently, cross-chain governance solutions have been patched together differently for all three of the chains that Uniswap is deployed on, leading to significant complexity and overhead for governance participants who wish to execute proposals governing deployments on other chains. This problem will multiply as Uniswap is deployed to more chains. Nomad can provide an out-of-the-box solution for this problem. Nomad\u2019s own contracts are governed by a decentralized cross-chain governance app built on its arbitrary message passing rails. This application can be tailored for the purpose of governing Uniswap deployments on chains other than Ethereum mainnet. Rather than attempting to introduce this change on all chains at once, however, we can demonstrate the value of this solution in a de-risked manner by leveraging it first for a new deployment, Moonbeam.  Rewards and Grants As part of this proposal, Nomad, via a grant from the Moonbeam Foundation, will commit $2,500,000 to the Uniswap Grants Program to help grow the Multichain Uniswap ecosystem. Through collaborative discussions with members of the Uniswap community, we learned that there were likely higher-leverage ways to enrich the Uniswap community than just providing liquidity mining rewards. As Uniswap develops into a multi-chain ecosystem, we want to support developers working to create high-quality multichain apps building on-top of Uniswap, and better multichain experiences for Uniswap users. These grants will promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation towards this goal. To borrow language from the Uniswap Grants + Gitcoin announcement, we hope for this initiative to fund \u201cbounties, hackathons, and grants\u201d for \u201cdevelopers, designers, community organizers and other web3 builders\u201d working on multi-chain projects which improve, extend, promote or build upon Unsiwap in a cross-chain manner. Examples of projects that could be funded with this grant include:  Building a cross-chain application which allows Uniswap LPs to close a position on Ethereum and open one atomically on Moonbeam Improving open-source wallet softwares to create better multi-chain user experiences for Uniswap users Building a frontend application which allows governance participants to more easily construct cross-chain governance proposals for Uniswap Leveraging Substrate\u2019s native interoperability protocol, XCM, to build an application which composes Uniswap on Moonbeam with another substrate chain Funding office hours to educate new users about multichain crypto experiences  We are so excited to see what members of the Uniswap community come up with to leverage this grant!  Conclusion We are excited about the possibility of the Uniswap community entering the Polkadot ecosystem via a V3 deployment on Moonbeam. To reiterate, we feel that this is a fantastic opportunity for the following reasons:   Expansion into Polkadot: Uniswap will be able to tap into a brand new market and all the community members in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeam\u2019s EVM-compatibility makes it simple to deploy existing Solidity code, while simultaneously providing access to other parachains using XCM. By leveraging XCM and Moonbeam\u2019s position as the DeFi hub for Polkadot, Uniswap has the opportunity to become the premier AMM across Polkadot.  Trust-minimized Governance: Per Uniswap\u2019s goal of becoming a multi-chain protocol while remaining trust-minimized, we propose using Nomad\u2019s trust-minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. This can serve as an opportunity to test this improved decentralized governance application within a safe container, with the potential of rolling it out to other V3 deployments in the future.  Rewards for Uniswap Grants Program: Instead of simply offering liquidity mining incentives, we want to fund community members working to develop and enrich multichain experiences built with Uniswap. We will commit $2.5M to the Uniswap Grants Program to fund cross-chain development deployed within the Uniswap ecosystem, in order to further expand Uniswap\u2019s multi-chain presence.  We are excited to engage with the Uniswap community and governance process to discuss more around bringing Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. Please let us know any and all feedback and criticism, so that we can improve this proposal and expand Uniswap into Moonbeam and Polkadot! ",
