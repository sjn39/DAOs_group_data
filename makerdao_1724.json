                    "content": " Executive Inclusion: GRO-001 MKR Vesting Stream Clean-Up The most recent executive proposal established a new MKR vesting stream over 12 months for the Growth Core Unit. As part of the preparation for this, GovAlpha liaised with @Nadia regarding the MKR vesting stream from the previous 12 month period. The Growth Core Unit had claimed 739.82 MKR from their 803 MKR stream, with no further MKR required. This left 63.18 MKR claimable within the stream. When setting up the new stream, this could potentially have led to a situation where GRO-001 were able to claim more MKR over the next 12 months than their maximum MKR budget approved by MKR holders - 803 MKR in the new stream + 63.18 MKR still in the previous year\u2019s stream. After discussion with PE, it was felt that the best approach was for the Growth CU to redirect their MKR stream to the Maker Pause Proxy - which was done in this transaction. The 63.18 MKR remaining in the stream is now unclaimable by the Growth Core Unit. An alternative would have been to vest and return the funds directly but due to the legal structure of some CUs this could potentially be deemed a taxable event. However, this has not necessarily been reflected in decentralized front-ends which monitor MKR streams such as Makerburn, which still displays the 63.18 MKR as claimable (rounded down), see screenshot.  928\u00d7689 34.1 KB  In order to ensure good on-chain accounting, PE and GovAlpha will be including logic in the upcoming executive vote which will vest the remaining MKR from the stream. This will, effectively, vest MKR from the Pause Proxy to the Pause Proxy, and there will be no change in the amount of MKR held within the Pause Proxy as a result. Inclusion of such logic into an executive proposal falls within our mandate as facilitators, as defined in MIP41c2 and MIP16c1. The benefit of such an action will be that any decentralized front-ends that monitor MKR streams - such as Makerburn - will be able to detect this action, and correctly display that the remaining MKR within the stream is no longer claimable, ensuring that any accounting is as accurate as possible. In retrospect, this same result could have been achieved by unrestricting the MKR stream at the time of redirecting it to the Pause Proxy, in which case any EOA could vest the remaining MKR permissionlessly. This would have negated the need for inclusion in an executive proposal. In future, GovAlpha will be recommending this approach to any CUs that find themselves in a similar situation.  cc: @Nadia, @cmooney, @Derek, @prose11, @strat-fin-core-unit, @makerburn ",
