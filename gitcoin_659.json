Happy New Year and welcome back to the first 2022-edition of the GitcoinDAO Digest! The newsletter took a pause for a couple of weeks but is now back with a lot of interesting updates. As usual, the GitcoinDAO Digest is a community-led publication with TLDR-summaries of the most important discussions and proposals in the GitcoinDAO, along with relevant links for further reading!   Key actions for this week:  Vote on the DAO Operations Workstream Budget - Q1 2022  Vote on the Grants Round 12 Ratification & Payout  Discover the Stewards Forum     Meta-Governance    Gitcoin 2021 Year in Review highlights \u201cthe progress we\u2019ve made towards our mission of growing and sustaining public goods in the past year and how we\u2019ve vastly exceeded our wildest expectations.\u201d   DAO Operations Budget - Q1 2022 by Kyle introduces the Operations Workstream, moving it \u201cfrom an informal Workstream to a proposal stage Workstream.The DAO Operations (DAOops) Workstream, is a Workstream in service of the DAO and our adjacent Workstreams.\u201d   The Grants Round 12 Ratification and Payout by Annika describes the currently active proposal on Snapshot to \u201cratify the GR12 payout amounts as being correct, fair, and abiding to community norms, including the judgments and sanctions made by the Fraud Detection & Defense Workstream.\u201d   Introducing the Steward Forum by Simona introduces the \u201cpotential creation of a Steward forum as a move towards a more active and engaged participation mechanic in governance. This forum will consist of the top 10 delegated addresses combined with an engagement score above 5/10. An open application process will also be in place for community members to join the forum provided their engagement score is 5/10.\u201d   Gitcoin DAO - Workstream Accountability Flow by Simona seeks to \u201camend, improve and standardise the proposal process for Gitcoin DAO. The purpose of this standardisation attempt is to improve transparency, accountability and accessibility when it comes to proposal review processes.\u201d   Grants Round 12 Governance Brief by Joe discusses how \u201cthe Fraud Detection & Defense Workstream (FDD) has worked to stay ahead in the red team versus blue team game. It also documents the decisions and reasons behind our subjective judgements. This Workstream is tasked with minimizing the effect of these liabilities on the community.\u201d   We saw a dozen of great submissions to the data analysis of Gitcoin GR12-bounty that explores trends and patterns in the Gitcoin Grants GR1-GR12 Dataset.   A brief history of Gitcoin from 2017 - 2021 by Owocki is a recap of Gitcoins history from the early days until today. \u201cGitcoin has helped 59,956 funders reach an audience of 262,688 earners. Gitcoin has facilitated 1,572,067 complete transactions to 9,700 unique earners.\u201d   A Quadratic Funding Powered Social Network by Owocki describes experiments combining public goods & social networks. The post describes the ambitions and the outcomes of Gitcoin\u2019s Townsquare with a tipping functionality as well as the lesser known \u201cMini Quadratic Funding\u201d rounds.   A Vision for A Pluralistic Civilizational Scale Infrastructure for funding Public Goods by Owocki articulates how \u201cImpactDAOs on Ethereum could scale to support all different types of public goods.\u201d ImpactDAOs are described in the post as \u201dany DAO that provides a positive externality, especially positive externalities for the public (not captured by any group).\u201d   2022 Roadmap & 2022 Goals by Owocki was started to \u201ccoordinate our 2022 goals across the Workstreams in the DAO.\u201d The thread has received input not only from Workstream leads, but also from the perspective of Gitcoin Holdings, Gitcoin Grants and user support.   Building GitcoinDAO\u2019s Legitimacy by Owocki talks about how \u201cthe DAO could build the legitimacy of a pluralistic scale infrastructure for funding public goods, inclusive of GitcoinDAO (but also respecting a need for pluralism - there are other great mechanisms that will build/fund public goods in the 21st century).\u201d     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview     Proposal Discussions Active Proposals Latest completed proposals     Introducing the Steward Forum DAO Operations Workstream Budget - Q1 2022 Public Goods Funding Workstream Budget Request for Q1 2022   2/17 ETH DENVER event Grants Round 12 Ratification & Payout Redistribute GTC to Individuals Who Could Not Claim Due to Error   Implementation of a Decentralized Bounty Platform - Progressive Decentralization Workstream  PrimeDAO Mutual Grant Agreement      Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding   The Public Goods Funding Workstream Budget Request for Q1 2022 passed, solidifying Gitcoin as a credibly neutral public goods funding mechanism. Funds will be dispersed across 3 key areas: grassroots community efforts, grants operations, and community partnerships. More details here.    Moonshot Collective    Check out Moonshot Collective Target State to learn about Owocki\u2019s three-year vision for our Workstream.   Every month Moonshot Collective Devs publicly demo the projects they\u2019ve been working on. This month\u2019s call was on January 10th. We looked at Fund.Party, dGrants, Pay.Party, Tip.Party, Tokenstream.Party, and Speedrun Ethereum.   We always post demo videos on the Moonshot Collective YouTube. If you weren\u2019t able to make the call, the demos will be available for you to watch in the next few days.     Decentralize Gitcoin    We\u2019re in the midst of planning for 2022 and we\u2019re aiming to have a roadmap for the year ahead completed by the end of January. Initiatives in the works include:  Planning work necessary to enable other teams/entities to run their own Grant Rounds using the dGrants Explorer Planning for creation of dGrantsjs library Planning for finalization of dGrants Protocol V1 Tightening scope to enable focus on priorities    Payouts for GR12 are nearly complete! For those who have yet to receive payouts, you can expect to receive it this week.   We\u2019ve also deployed a wiki page for the dGitcoin team to organize documents and projects.   For DevOps we\u2019ve been creating a request portal to make it easier to request DevOps type changes. We\u2019ve implemented DNS configuration changes for the DAO, and we will be working with FDD to understand DevOps related needs better.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    Operations  We\u2019ve just concluded our Q1 Strategy & Deliverables Workshop for Operations and Sybil Defense, two more are coming in the next days for Grant Eligibility and Research! We\u2019re also rebooting the FDD Operating System for Q1, to incorporate a flat organizational structure, an updated compensation model, and a cadence for meetings and planning.    Sybil Defense  In the meantime, we\u2019re working on requirements for participation from a sybil data federation to share data in a community data lake anonymized for ML-modeling. Community algo will also have its first run this month! Feel free to also check out the Blockscience review of GR12.    Grant Eligibility  The Grant approval time will now start 30 days prior to each round and end 7 days into the round. This allows for better training and more time for disputes to be resolved. We will begin using the GIA ethelo model to build an integration for the grant approvals squad. Policy maintenance moving to the newly approved Gitbook knowledge base.    Research  Some deliverables that we\u2019re still working on from Q4 2021 include:  Data analysis of human evaluations for ML-pipeline to gain insights on the inter-reviewer variations to improve training for reviewers. Documentation of the bottoms-up stream building experiment and the process for building bottom-up governance for streams. Actionable insights from the Token Engineering Academy DAO Rewards Policy research program for GitcoinDAO. Top 10 sybil profiles research giving insights to human evaluators & the feature engineers to improve their work.        Merch, Memes & Marketing    We launched a new meeting structure for MMM contributors starting next week which will take place in the #MMM Workstation channel in Discord:   Weekly Team Sync on Mondays  Drop-in office hours on Tuesadys and Thursdays  Design Sprint on Wednesdays    We\u2019ve created POAPs for FDD\u2019s Grants Investigation Agency & contributors to the GitcoinDAO Primer. Our POAP production will go up several notches this quarter, stay tuned for more!   We\u2019ve begun an analytics project to determine the performance of the grants product from a funder\u2019s perspective.   We\u2019ve implemented a new content strategy & cadence on our main Twitter handle. The goal is to build an audience in core channels and to increase comprehension: you can see an example of this here.   Developer meetups in Lisbon, Denver, Singapore, Berlin are in the works.
