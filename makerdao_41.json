My name is Payton. I am one of the Governance Facilitators at MakerDAO. We like people to get involved and ask questions or comments, so please, do not be shy if you have something to say.   Weekly Updates  Governance  LongForWisdom 01:02  No polls ended this week. However, two sets of polls are active 1. Both are greenlit polls: G-UNIv3-DAIUSDC and U-Drop Tokens. Ratification polls are still active. Last week\u2019s executive has not yet passed.   GovAlpha Core Unit update 02:14 GovAlpha Weekly Update   @longforwisdom created a thorough post on the Delegation process. Will be hosting the new Meet Your Delegate calls on Wednesday, July 28th @ 18:00 UTC. The GovAlpha Budget will be updated per quarter instead of the regular 2-quarter update. The MIPs Portal has some new addition, which will be live today!   Forum at a Glance  S\u00e9bix 04:13 Forum at a Glance for July 15 - 22  Three-Point Summary  Surplus Buffer went down to 48M DAI due to Core Unit Budget Distributions last weekend after hitting 50M for the very first time. Total Value Locked went down a bit too (but not too much) to almost 9.2B. Pegs looking stable since last week.   ICYMI - Announcements  Tim (@twblack88) posted a couple of interesting articles in this week\u2019s Relay you may have missed:  Messari:  Stablecoins facilitated an astonishing $1.7T in transaction volume in Q2 Explores the growth of stablecoins and notes that decentralized stablecoins like Dai have maintained a consistent upward trajectory. Stablecoins Swelled by $13B in 30 Days, Captured 67% of Today\u2019s Crypto Trade Volume  @LongForWisdom brings us two posts about Delegations, which details the purpose, types, and requirements to be a Delegate:  Delegation and MakerDAO Recognised Delegate Requirements    Guide to the Signaling Process- @AstronautThis posted a very helpful guide on how to participate in the signaling process at MakerDAO by starting a signal request.     Active Discussions   Dai on Different Chains #2   @alec delves more about the wallets holding Dai on non-EVM chains.    I will vote NO on the ratification poll for Strategic Marcomms Core Unit   @Planet_X has expressed his opinions against the Ratification Poll for Strategic Marcomms CU, prompting various responses from several members of the pointed team.    \u201cTaming Wildcat Stablecoins\u201d Paper \u2013 MakerDAO vs Centralized Stablecoins   @PaperImperium brings his thoughts on the recent paper released by the Federal Reserve (with the National Bureau of Economic Research) about regulating stablecoin issuers as banks.    Amazix, the Marketing firm with the worst track record in the ICO era In the final stretch of the voting for the onboarding of the AmaZix Core Unit in the executives, an anonymous post reignites debate. Some community members believe this might not be the best approach to discussing this kind of matter.   Signal Requests   Adjust UNIV2DAIUSDC-A DC-IAM-line   @ultraschuppi is signaling to raise the debt ceiling for UNIV2DAIUSDC-A. Go vote!     Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 07:00  A large part of the team is in Paris right now, so our update is a little sparse. We have been encumbered by a really big review. On top of that review, we have been looking at revising the four new Centrifuge assets for RWA. We created a large comprehensive checklist of things to go through every time we onboard these. This is an upfront work that will hopefully make things faster in the future. Those four collaterals are currently in Kovan. That Spell has been executed, and they are running. We are in the process of reviewing the main Spell now. You will get a kick out of the checklist if you go to Spell\u2019s Mainnet repo and look at that checklist. For contract work, we have the DssVest code, which is still in audit. They have sent out a few new things, but I have been heads down on other stuff. I will need to look at what they found.  We added the Lerp helpers to the DssExecLib. The ClipperCallee Implementation for SushiJoin is still in review. For discussions, we will start deploying to Goerli within the coming weeks. We just need to clear out that slate a little bit. We will not likely be on Goerli when London has Mainnet, which is not ideal, but it is what it is. If that is a major problem for another team, please let us know. We will probably be completely cut over to Goerli in the next month. The DssCharter, a kind of \u201cPermission Vault,\u201d has been reviewed and discussed with the Risk and Growth teams. I think they met in person in Paris; they might cover that in more detail. We had a postmortem that we are reviewing now, and we will post for the Spell that was off. The DC for that Spell needed to be increased. Our normal process goes to the DssExecutive directly to increase the DC. Whenever we do that for RWA, there is this additional caveat where we need to also bump the price because those do not have real Oracles. In a normal case, an Oracle is always adjusting the price. In the case of RWA, we mock out the Oracle. We then need to adjust the price in the Oracle at the same time we increase the DC. Since it was the first time we have ever increased a DC for an RWA, the price adjustment was forgotten. There will be more details on that postmortem. That list is on the PE team because it was a sparse list. The list has a thing they have been working on that I missed. Is there anyone that wants to add an update or anyone that has any questions?   Discussion  Matthew Rabinowitz: Is that a MIP21 or MIP22 issue?  Christopher Mooney: It is going to be a MIP21 issue. Anytime that we increase the DC, we need to bump the price of the collateral. The tokens that we use for the MIP21 adapter are basically mocked-out tokens; they do not have a real discoverable price. We are the ones creating the market value based on the loan that we give to it.   Wouter: Can you provide a little more background on the connection between the Goerli test net and why it is relevant to the London update?  Christopher Mooney: Coven, which is the testnet that we use now, is at the end of life. They are no longer going to support updates, so we will not get a chance to see London as deployed on the Coven. I made those changes because I keep updating my open Ethereum nodes to get them to keep up to date. Coven may end up supporting London, but that will be the last thing it does. It may not hit it in time for the release, so I am unsure where Kovan stands regarding the London Hard Fork. Robsten went first, which is relevant because there was a consensus bug yesterday or the day before, which I might have seen a few weeks ago. After all, I could not sink a note against Robsten post their London update. Goerli had the tail end of the change for the upgrade to London. Goerli is multi-client. Robsten is multi-client, too, but in the Gov Dev call, it seemed like Goerli would be the testnet in the last staging environment before things went to Mainnet. In my experience, syncing Goerli was good, but the downside is how gas is handled and wallets. The biggest impact would be with UIS on Coven. It would be nice if we were already on Goerli and test that. The Coven shut down news came a little late for our ability to stay on schedule and react to it. Wouter: Did we have a Robsten deployment or not? Christopher Mooney: I think we might have a Robsten deployment. It is the changelog. You can look there, but it may be very old. Wouter: The consequence is that the front-end teams should have their front-ends as soon as the London Hard Fork happens, right? Christopher Mooney: Yes. I would even say that how we calculate gas is going to be totally different. Keepers need to think about how they calculate gas. If you are describing Dai and those APIs have calculated the gas, then you will be okay. How you calculate gas is the biggest caveat, and I do not mean that in a good way. They are trying to figure out how to do the gas calculation for my crypto. Wouter: Maybe we can move this discussion to after the updates because it grants more in-depth discussion. Especially because there are a few scenarios that can unfold. This is a big update, and it can bring volatile market conditions with it. At the same time, the processes that prevent things like Black Thursdays will be retested in a new environment. Christopher Mooney: Exactly. We all calculate gas wrong, and we get volatile network conditions, then the keepers do not work, and we are in trouble. We can think about a few things at the end of the call altogether and maybe develop some action plan.     Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 17:06  Next week is going to be my team within the Foundation\u2019s last week. Beginning August 1st, we will officially be spun out. The legal entity formation is underway for the new Oracle CU. It is a transitionary period where we are trying to ensure that the transfer of information for things like infrastructure, internal processes, important historical documentation, etc., is possible. We want to identify the new processes that we need to spin up within the CU. Those used to be responsibilities that were covered within the Foundation. On the technical side, the production deployment of libp2p is continuing. We moved on to a new phase.  Now that we have ascertained that the build is stable, we have been rolling them out to the rest of them. We are in the final stages of that rollout. Hopefully, next week I can be telling you that the rollout has been 100% complete. The timing of that is quite good, considering it will be right when we leave the Foundation. It is a good breakpoint before we start the next projects that we have in mind. On the development side, I have been taking a deeper look at staked ETH and the Oracle that would be needed for the fast Dai Withdrawl bridge for optimism. We will be doing the two interim projects before we kick off the big roadmap that we have for the Oracle CU and the Oracle protocol. We added support to Matic, and testing for that is underway. We should be good to deploy it within the next weeks.   Risk Team Update  Marko \u0160temberger 20:55  Primoz is on vacation; that is why I am doing this weekly update. From the previous week, we are still working on simulations for lower Liq ratio Vaults. Hopefully, we will publish the results next week, but it is currently in progress. This week, we started working on the AAVE monitor. It will help us monitor the risk-relevant for the Direct Deposit Module. It will include segmentation of the largest users based on the type of their position. It will be similar to what we showed in the risk assessment: what percentage of assets is used for recourse leverage farming and what is not. This information will be related to Maker Vault users. It will give us a better understanding of what users can easily unwind their position in the case of market drops. Something similar will be built for Compound because there is also a lot of recourse to leverage farming with Dai. We have started working on a historical analysis of Vault users and their behavior. This will include some Growth and Risk related topics. For example, how many Vaults did we manage to retain based on different periods when the Vault was created? How are users managing Risk? This will include when the price drops and users need to increase their collateral ratio. Are they doing so just by adding more collateral or repaying debt or some combination of it? Also, things like who is protected by DeFi saver and similar things. We started working on the gUNI-DAI-USDC risk assessment. It will be published in the following weeks. Finally, we made some updates to the collateral onboarding prioritization table, merged it with the official public file in the following days.   Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 23:50   @aes published a budget analysis on the forum. It looks forward to expenses and revenues for the upcoming 12 months. If we onboard all CUs, we will be negative in net income; we will make a deficit. We will still be cash flow positive which is good because we can increase the surplus buffer this way. We can follow the discussion in the forum and participate in chiming in and seeing what the Protocol should do regarding the situation. We can have more news in the following month, but it is always good to have a spreadsheet to work on and test some hypotheses. Four Centrifuge assets will be on the Spell tomorrow. On the SolarX front, we might be too late to take the opportunity to invest in the first solar farm project they are working on. We are still working with them on another kind of project, but our main focus is to donate, and we are working a lot on our common Foundation. Most of the stuff is more or less solved. We have started to work on the MIP, focusing on communication between MakerDAO and the Foundation. More on that should be in by the end of the month. Matthew said that it would not be possible to do it in one month, and he was right.   Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 26:22 Growth CU Weekly Updates  It has been an amazing week in Paris. We are happy to meet people from the community. We had a Maker Mafia side event yesterday, which was great. I think it is important to maintain the presence of Maker in different conferences. T explains to everyone the process that we are going through: the importance of the DAO, the community, how we are becoming decentralized because that is interesting for the crypto community in general and for people outside of the crypto ecosystem. It was also interesting to see all these Maker followers always wanting to understand what we are doing. We definitely have to have more presence in conferences like this. Gustav and I participated in EthCC. Gustav spoke about RWA, and I spoke about the transition from the Foundation to the DAO. During the past month, we have been working with Grayscale. They announced they would include the Maker token in the DeFi fund they just launched. We have been working with them, explaining Grayscale legal team everything about Maker. In the following weeks, we will start an educational program that they want to launch for their investors. Thank you so much to Nik, who was in the Twitter space of Grayscale on Tuesday to tell everyone about Maker.   Questions  LongForWisdom: Any major surprise at the event? Was anyone two feet taller or shorter than expected?  Juan: Derek. Definitely Derek. laughs  Nadia Alvarez: During the Maker Mafia event, every CU told the audience what they are doing. We had Juan, we had Kat, Derek, and Sam. Juan was also Payton. @Payton, maybe Juan created some confusion. And, Long, a guy said that he was you. LongForWisdom: Really? That is funny. Nadia Alvarez: Yes, with a British accent and all of that. I do not know what to think\u2026 LongForWisdom: Well, it was not me! laughs  Juan: That is what you would say\u2026 LongForWisdom: It is what I would say, but I have been writing docs all week. Super glad it went well.     Content Production Update  Seth Goldfarb 31:00 Content Production Biweekly Updates  We published a quarterly update this week, which is the last update for the first quarter of operation. We\u2019ll be doing an accounting update in the next forum update, so it\u2019s clear how our funds are managed. The budget that we proposed for the next quarter is currently passing, so thank you to everyone who supported it. A big focus for the last couple of weeks has been creating audio and video clips for Maker Relay. Three videos covering this week\u2019s Relay are on youtube already. We\u2019re going to create videos covering current events, the state of Dai, and votes and polls. It\u2019s taken a little bit of work to get production rolling, but once we get two or three weeks into this, the process should get more streamlined. We think this will be a pretty low-effort, high-quality spotlight on our leadership in decentralized Governance. We\u2019ve also met with GovAlpha and Protocol Engineering to discuss future explainer videos focused on Governance in the Protocol. We\u2019re honing on the organization of those. If anyone has any ideas for specific videos they\u2019d like to see or how those videos could be organized, please feel free to reach out with feedback. All of the past requests have been incorporated already. The art contest for the MakerDAO mascot will be running through the end of the month. Please send in your submissions to [email\u00a0protected] We got the Community Portal redirected, so it now points to makerdao.world. We were finally able to get technical support on dealing with the backend, which proved more work than anticipated, meaning it\u2019s more efficient to overhaul the whole thing than to bring someone on to keep it updated. Apologies to anyone I promised to publish articles on the community blog that has to go on the back-burner. The Community Portal will be back with a friendlier content-management system. Kat got the opportunity to speak at the EthCC MakerMafia event yesterday. If you want to know what the content team is up to, please get in touch. We put a post in the forum about conducting brand research. We want to speak with everyone willing to answer the question: \u201cWhy does MakerDAO matter to you?\u201d We\u2019re aggregating these results to share with the community. It will help inform the content we\u2019ll be creating over the next months. Please sign up; we\u2019re looking for 15-30 minutes of your time.   Questions  David Utrobin: What\u2019s the blocker for the blog?  Seth Goldfarb: The Portal was created to make it easy for contributors to update it. It, unfortunately, requires too much technical work to be a robust solution for us. David Utrobin: Do you mean it takes a lot of time because the process of publishing is work-heavy? Seth Goldfarb: Somewhat, but it\u2019s more about the number of dependencies that have been integrated with the backend and would need to be updated on an ongoing basis, resulting in a larger problem that we may want to deal with. David Utrobin: I see, thanks. Wouter: Would the new version still have the possibility for outside contributors to send in suggestions? Seth Goldfarb: Yes, we want it to retain that functionality.   LongForWisdom: I was curious about the mascot competition. Have you received any submissions so far?  Seth Goldfarb: To be honest, we haven\u2019t received any submissions yet. With EthCC, we didn\u2019t expect to get many submissions until later in the month. We\u2019re going to push this week and promote it more. I know Kat\u2019s been giving out cards during EthCC.     Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling  Juan Guill\u00e9n 38:48  1431\u00d7715 124 KB   Public Folder Dai Foundation MIPs in RFC   1285\u00d7726 148 KB   The DAOist   1280\u00d7722 94.9 KB   Wouter: We are working on better visualizing the different projects being done and the milestones we have planned for the future.   Questions  LongForWisdom: I am curious on what the length of time for the incubees is the plan? Is it just until they are ready? Is any of them close to ready? Is there a fixed cutoff, or how does that work?  Juan: It really depends. The official answer is that we aim for four to eight months, but it depends on each team\u2019s background. Some of them are really well acquainted with Maker. They have been working among themselves. They have a really solid base on anything that has to do with decentralized organizations. Depending on what they need to do, it might be \u201clet\u2019s provide value, let\u2019s make sure that all the checklist is done and you are out writing the MIP.\u201d Or it could be a much longer process where we need to give courses on what Maker is doing, how they can help, and more. We have a list of all the modules that we have built with potential deliverables at the end. That would be useful for CUs that cannot incubate because of bandwidth or because they do not fall into our mandate. Still, everyone would be able to follow the course on their own with the provided templates. We will make that list public soon. Wouter: I would expect that tomorrow, at least at the DAI level, these objectives and key results that we include for everything will be included in the presentation that Nikolaj will be giving. Also, the timeline is heavily influenced by the configuration of the team. Mostly whether they have worked together before or if they are a new team. A new team takes way more time to set up and make efficient than a team working together for a long time.

Everything else is currently passing.

Presentations and Other Discussions  Open Discussion  Announcements 53:31  PaperImperium: Please remember that on Wednesday, July 28th at 16:00 UTC, we will have Representative Ted Budd of the US House Financial Services Committee as our third guest for a Q&A with MakerDAO. Go ahead and mark your calendar! There\u2019s an anonymous question box available. LongForWisdom: I\u2019ll plug another meeting that will take place on the same day, July 28th, at 18:00 UTC. During the first Meet Your Delegate call, there will be an opportunity to recognize delegates and ask them questions. It\u2019s a great place to show up if you plan on delegating MKR to someone and you\u2019re not sure who.   Restructuring Marketing in MakerDAO 55:30  Christopher Mooney: I won\u2019t plug them, but I have a question considering the MarComms CU. What\u2019s the story behind how the voting goes? Are the MKR holders not content with the team\u2019s structure or their performance? As we build stuff, we will need somebody who would champion that and push forward a narrative. We need some sort of a marketing group. Since that group is in limbo, we\u2019ve had situations where we wouldn\u2019t do well against our competition. Regarding MarComms, do we think we can do better? Or do we think we don\u2019t need marketing?  Wouter: As an MKR holder, I would also ask if having no marketing team is better than having one you\u2019re not 100% convinced of? Planet_X: I believe it\u2019s up to me to answer. As an MKR holder, I voted against the formation of the MarComms CU. I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re up to the task. We could say it was the Foundation that gimped them. Still, I think they never prevented the team from planning something useful. I\u2019m torn by the whole situation. However, I believe it\u2019d be better to start all over again. This is because it\u2019s not only Dai that needs marketing but also community, vaults, etc. I don\u2019t see the potential for that in the MarComms CU. I have put my arguments in the forum. It\u2019s hard to prove my opinion as marketing is not as strict as mathematics. Right now, I couldn\u2019t look another MKR holder straight in the eye and say that the marketing is handled well enough. I\u2019m open to changing my mind, but I think we should start from scratch. Even if it means having no team for months. My view on MarComms might be unpopular, but it\u2019s real and honest. Please, voice your opinion if you don\u2019t agree. Also, the issue with AmaZix proved we don\u2019t have an effective interface for dealing with an external marketing team. They made a proposal that got rejected by everyone. David Utrobin: To clarify, my understanding is that the Strategic MarComms team, as it\u2019s proposed now, is not the same as the one in the Foundation. Some members were on that team. It\u2019s led by Kathleen, who worked with Coulter. So it\u2019s a derivative team, but they are starting from scratch. Personally, I\u2019m not convinced we should be starting from total scratch. People who worked at the Foundation gained a lot of foundational knowledge and built out the foundational image of Maker. I don\u2019t think that should be put to waste. Having people from the original marketing team in this new marketing team makes sense to me, and that\u2019s part of the reason for my voting \u2018yes.\u2019 Planet_X: I\u2019m not 100% on this, but my gut feeling says we should start all over. David Utrobin: Okay, thanks for sharing.   Christopher Mooney: Part of the issue is that it\u2019d be hard for any marketing team to develop a very detailed plan. As Maker, we haven\u2019t established what image we want to project or what we want our DAO\u2019s semi-official messaging. David Utrobin: Also, it\u2019s not always clear to people what the actual product offerings on Maker are. There\u2019s a huge focus on Dai, but it\u2019s only one side of the coin. There\u2019s a potential line of business in oracles; there are many new vaults, there\u2019s the DSR, etc. External marketing teams will have a hard and long time getting up to speed on what exactly their marketing is.  Planet_X: You are entirely correct about that. Everyone can have an opinion on marketing, so there\u2019s also a risk of making them a scapegoat. The job is very hard, I know that. Still, I\u2019ve stated my opinion. Nadia: From what I hear, another problem with MarComms might be their budget proposal. Without the brand, products, or market defined, we don\u2019t know what the team could do within Maker. It\u2019s hard to tell if the budget proposal is relevant. From an MKR holder\u2019s perspective, it could raise doubts. In addition, it\u2019s a one-year budget. As the Growth CU, we decided to present a quarterly budget. My thinking behind it was that we should first present results and show the community what Growth is about. It might be a good idea for future CUs to start with a quarterly budget. It\u2019d help the community and the group see and understand what they can do within the DAO. For example, what we are doing now in Growth is different from what we did when we were at the Foundation. The new context required recalculating our budget. Planet_X: I don\u2019t have a perfect solution to the whole problem. Yet, I could imagine having at some point a marketing steering group that would navigate and provide directions on what we want marketing to do. Based on that, the initiatives could originate in-house.   Juan: We will see as a DAO that it\u2019s very hard to come with a unified vision, for better or worse. We will probably end up seeing different CUs getting their marketing budget. I could imagine Growth getting one, and Nik already announced some marketing budget for the Oracles CU. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the best way. However, we will have a hard time until a CU comes with a vision that resonates with the DAO and the MKR holders. Deciding on a vision within a committee would also be difficult. We would get as many visions as there would be people in the committee. As we grow more and more decentralized, we\u2019ll probably have to see either the marketing function within the CUs or maybe we\u2019ll have one CU with a message that resonates with the rest of the community.  Planet_X: You could be completely correct about that. LongForWisdom: I don\u2019t love the idea of every CU handling their own marketing stuff. It seems a little inefficient, though maybe more decentralized. I wouldn\u2019t like to be the one worrying about how to spread the message of, e.g., how the delegates work. Even aside from the vision discussion, it would be useful to have a CU you could go to and ask them to organize a marketing push on something. Juan: Absolutely. I can imagine having a group or just one person doing the marketing on a per-hour basis and then later getting a budget from the DAO. It could address the concern with a new CU being paid upfront before proving their quality. I don\u2019t think every CU will need its own marketing function. However, I see potential in CUs getting marketing people to help from within or a small group of people who want to prove that they can do it. It could start small and then scale up. David Utrobin: I agree with the \u2018starting small and scaling up\u2019 approach. It makes a lot of sense to me.   Monkey.irish: One of the key aspects of this particular CU is that there are constraints in the Foundation and the DAO. Speaking from the experience of managing that transition for the past six-plus months, there\u2019s a lot that the community will never know about the constraints that we had in our systems for a variety of reasons. I know that the past is an indicator of future results, but it might not be the case. We also have a governance system set up to enable us to say, \"let\u2019s put you in there, but we\u2019ll evaluate your performance later on. I\u2019d encourage us to use those built-in systems in this case.  LongForWisdom: Most of that is on the proposing team. The team proposes a budget for a period of time. If they want to propose a shorter budget, maybe that gives it more chance of passing. If a CU proposes a year-long budget, it\u2019s hard for the government to cut it off halfway through. Monkey.irish: I hear you. Yet, we\u2019re in a monthly budget cycle as the execs go through. There are checks and balances in the system to ensure that we\u2019re not spending money where we don\u2019t need to. Again, let\u2019s utilize the systems we have set up to try and give people an opportunity to put them closer to action and utilize their domain knowledge. If they\u2019re not successful, let\u2019s work with them to ensure that we can achieve success. Juan: One of the factors for this disconnect with MarComms might be that there are usually no members from the team on the G&R call. Time zones might be to blame as people are located all around the world.   Seth Goldfarb: Regarding AmaZix\u2019s proposal: typically, agencies work with companies with some sort of a marketing director or manager, and the agencies know what they\u2019re supposed to do for the company. With the AmaZix proposal, I was concerned that we don\u2019t have a team ready to take that responsibility. As part of Content Production, I wouldn\u2019t want to take it on. I think there\u2019s a dissonance there from a structural perspective. To that point, I think Planet_X\u2019s suggestion about a committee-based approach would be the way to go. We\u2019ve had discussions around the parallelization of CUs, and that\u2019s an effort I generally support. However, I do see some issues with marketing units in particular. As others have brought up, there needs to be some level of cohesion around branding. I love the idea of having multiple CUs working on marketing. Still, they definitely need to be synced up on messaging. Another issue is the lack of specificity around the type of marketing activities that teams will engage in and why they make sense for the DAO. We\u2019ve struggled with this even in our team. We can come up with different ideas, but we have to decide what\u2019s currently most effective at the end of the day. We do have certain needs that it\u2019d be helpful to address. One is specifically around PR. I believe GovComms will take that on, so I\u2019m excited to see that. We could work on some forum posts in the upcoming weeks to get a clear vision of what marketing activities the DAO would find valuable.  David Utrobin: I think it\u2019d be a great idea for MakerDAO as an organization to devote a month annually to solidifying and revisiting the vision of what we see as a success, what we want to market at MakerDAO, etc. Marketing teams are at the whim of who participates and who interacts with them. That\u2019s why I encourage people from other CUs to participate in those conversations because without their input, it\u2019s hard to understand what the consensus is. I believe a marketing or vision month would make it more inclusive. Christopher Mooney: There\u2019s an alternative which we could go with right now. It\u2019d be agreeing that we don\u2019t need a unifying vision for marketing. We have individual features that we\u2019ll release and individual audiences that these features are targeted at. To give an example, we just pushed the ability to take and use a 500 million Dai flash loan in a single block. I just looked at the contract. Not a single person has consumed a flash loan off that thing and sent it. It\u2019s because most people don\u2019t know they can do it. It might also be a problem with the documentation. We don\u2019t know that unless someone is trying to market it. Meanwhile, the PE team\u2019s moved on to work on something else. We don\u2019t need a unified vision to tell DeFi or engineers that a feature exists. We don\u2019t really need to know exactly what the audience is as it may change. There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t be targeting institutions and end-users. Right now, I\u2019m worried that without any kind of marketing, we will end up in a default scenario, e.g., Growth is pushing hard. Still, they might bucket us into the institutional direction. Maybe we could end up with more end-users, but it\u2019s hard to take a gamble there, and I believe you would get a ton of growth. Millions of users might not amount to one institution. Yet, we are trying to build an inclusive place without gatekeepers. We don\u2019t want to repeat mistakes from the past. I\u2019m afraid that without a marketing CU, we won\u2019t be able to market to end-users. Even without a unifying vision, we need minimal marketing to gain adoption for the features we create. Eventually, we probably want to develop a unifying brand image, but we don\u2019t have to do that now. Wouter: I want to go a step further than Chris. I\u2019d challenge the fact we even need a single vision and brand image in the long term. I don\u2019t find pushing in this direction good. As a DAO, it\u2019s impossible to agree on that and do it effectively. Instead, we should focus on smaller groups and maybe use the so-called guerilla-style marketing. It might concern marketing individual features, or individual CUs, etc. We\u2019re not marketing Coca-Cola, we\u2019re marketing a decentralized ecosystem, and there\u2019ll always be different views on the ecosystem. I believe it should continue to be the case in the long run. Otherwise, we could lose out to our centralized competitors. Mariano: In a discussion in the forum before, as Growth, we came up with an idea of product marketing where each CU could market their product they know well. I like, e.g., how Oracles have their own marketing budget because they know exactly what people who use oracles are looking for. It could work the same for flash loans. It\u2019s hard to develop a message and look for an audience when a feature is very unique. I can imagine a small CU that would handle the branding, but I find product marketing the best and most efficient for us. LongForWisdom: I think I saw a lot of agreement with what Wouter was saying. From a governance perspective, it\u2019s a lot of expense for something that doesn\u2019t give us too much gain.   Matthew Rabinowitz: One brief point on the successful capital structure. We\u2019ve been waiting for a movement with the broker-dealer for the last few weeks to get the documentation finalized. It\u2019s giving us our Dai address. It arrived about half an hour ago. Now we will be getting that Dai address put into a target address set up in MIP21. Then, we\u2019ll be moving to close with the trustee in the coming weeks. So stay tuned!

If the total market size is 90M and 80M borrowed with 10M available in actual DAI.  This is a utilization of 89%, which is higher than the 80% optimal range.  Not optimal for users.   The D3M will return the utilization down to 80%. Leaves more DAI available within the pool. Same situation if the event is inversed; D3M will return utilization up to 80% if below that threshold. 50M DC is the next step concerning parameter upgrades.     Wintermute Re-Discussion  Andrew Burban  Why you hatin\u2019 on Wintermute?? Look, they want to partner with us. They aren\u2019t concerned about the strike price. If you want metrics, they shall provide. On another note, MKR has very thin order books; very difficult to scale in and out. Burbanomics analysis says this is a good deal.  MKR pump plz.

We should aim to deal with the highest quality counterparties and underwrite credit-focused not on high and attractive yields but rather having a stable, sustainable, and scalable risk-adjusted yield. Instead, we do not need to make 10% but focus on making a solid 1% to scale and expand the DAI footprint.   728\u00d7410 55.4 KB   728\u00d7411 49.6 KB   730\u00d7407 27.4 KB   We want to make this as collaborative as possible.  After we release our report, we most likely open a consultation phase to onboard all comments from the community. Hopefully, if there is an agreement in the forums, we may move forth with implementation.  22:16  SebVentures: I have two questions. Firstly, who are we? You only mentioned yourself in the slide, although it could be interesting to see what aspect you bring to the table. Secondly, you said you want to make a patient only with the highest quality of counterparties. All the counterparties proposed by a young startup with less than two years of research track record. How do you reconcile those items?  22:55  Luca Prosperi: When I talk about us, I mean two things. Firstly, I have been leading this project myself. I am the author and the primary signature on this project, but this is an SCS back project. Everything I have we have discussed so far has been shared with SCS. Unless one thinks differently, our work also represents the view, in some way, of ACS. I have direct expertise, so my input is the primary input here. I have been discussing with other community parties that have been involved in real-world financing in some shape or form. However, these have been collaborations, sources of information, and views but not authorship. Most people are interested and agree with how we can improve and scale the process, but the content is my responsibility in my view alone. How do we reconcile? This project and Rune\u2019s view on the arranger model are independent. I started this project, and I had not spoken to Rune ever. He was so kind to reach out in the last weeks because he knew what we were working on. He wanted to get our point of view and share what he thought could be the future of Maker. We were financing that. However, I have not been involved in drafting his post, and he has not been involved in drafting the report that we will publish. There are similarities, but there are also differences. One of the key differences and things we need to reconcile is the quality of the counterparties. The counterparties will have to go through an extensive and accurate process of onboarding. They will have some key compliance requirements needed to interact with Maker. Those requirements would depend on the nature of our credit and the mitigating credit factors in place. This process will have to be as rigorous as possible. We have not shared those criteria. We also have not started onboarding those counterparties. It is very early to tell, but we need to be as conservative as possible in dealing with the counterparties. In practice, those counterparties will have to have regulatory stamping, prove a solid track record, and work with the most reputable borrowers on the backend. They will also need to provide best-in-class credit, credit structuring, and credit risk-mitigating factors. How this will translate into reality is still yet to be seen.  26:19  Juan: I want to add to what was happening in the chat; the SES provides the grant. We do believe that is one of the possible ways to 100x Maker. This initiative aligns with our mission and vision of scaling the ecosystem.  26:54  Prose11: I have one in terms of positioning Makers as the supercenter lender. Given our cost of capital, this does make sense. I am curious about your thoughts on attracting counterparties. It seems like if I were an institution looking for lending, it would be much safer going to a bank with the current low rates. What are your thoughts on that?  27:20  Luca Prosperi: I have been involved in providing liquidity to alternative lenders for ten years. I started as a hedge fund manager. We were providing liquidity by buying credit from originating lenders in the United States. Our cost of capital was 8-10%. This is what we wanted to make out of the credit net of losses. When I started, I changed my job from an investor to a productivity investor. When we owned a bank in ACB, I was on the board as a board observer. We were purchasing credit from alternative lenders as a bank. The yield cost of liquidity is meager today but not zero for banks. We were underwriting senior credit originated by platforms of the highest quality at 4-5%. This was our breakeven yield. 5% levered as a bank become becomes 20-25%. Banks have difficulty in providing this type of lending at cheaper rates. You can achieve cheaper rates if you have struck a securitization. This realization is very liquid. Then, you can access senior lenders at 50 basis points, 1%. Maker is still extremely competitive even against the most senior lenders. It is just another pool of capital. I believe they could finance their senior covered bond and negative rates. They are still going for Maker because it allows them access to another pool of capital. And then suddenly that 0%, the very cheap cost of Maker capital, becomes very attractive for other types of solid but higher-yielding assets. Maker has the space to be an attractive pool of capital for high-quality institutional lenders.  29:37  Jason Jones: Thanks for the question. Payton. I have actively brought in several real-world assets to Maker today. What we are seeing now is raising the bar. The new originators brought to Maker will be in a whole different class than what we have experimented with in the past year. I certainly see that in the market. The quality level of those that will be seeking capital is significantly higher compared to the past. We are talking banks, large asset originators, and triple-league quality borrowers. So, very high quality. For Luca and Will, the question is, how will this new SCS sandbox work with the real world as a working group or finance? Officially the finance core unit. When we are navigating and bringing collateral to Maker, we just need to clarify whom we talked to and how we get it through the process. And hopefully, that will be resolved relatively soon.  30:53  Luca Prosperi: I can speak on my concerns and let the real-world core units speak for theirs. As a specialist and Maker community member, I am just writing a report on how I see our scaling method. This report is simply the product of my views and has no official backing whatsoever by the community. We are still working on the process of how I think the process can be improved and turbocharged. This process is not a substitution to what the real world finance core unit has been doing, but merely an addition. Having clarity on what type of things we want to do has immense power to the outside world, signaling what we are ready to embark on and what we are not prepared to waste our time on. The structuring part will be healthy by having separation of origination and risk management capabilities and distributing the responsibilities outside of the community for the heavy lifting. I will need to detail my view with the other project stakeholders in the second phase of our project. The report will be ready in the next two or three weeks. What comes next will depend on what the community decides to do. The current facilities for the date precipitator, our financing team members, can give you a better answer today. I am just providing my view as an expert that has been on a grant by SCS.  33:01  Juan: This grant\u2019s idea is to research how to scale this up. One way could be working together. Another way could be creating work prioritization. Another could be different powers checking one another, such as sourcing, checking the risk, etc. This is not my field of expertise, so I do not want to go too deep.  33:55  SebVentures: Currently, the clarity is not super high. Everything is in place as the team is working as they did last week, continuing to onboard. There are no changes yet except for association tasks above us. It\u2019s difficult to work with a DAO when directions are changing every day.  34:48  Kirk: I want to add a general comment that has nothing to do with real-world finance but more about the structure of the DAO. Since everything is transparent and open, we need to learn to deal with the mass communication buzzing around early-stage projects that are not yet the official policy of the DAO. When someone like Wouter comes to the forum with just a proposal, crypto media outlets will portray this as what MakerDAO is now doing. We should be careful in clarifying the proposals\u2019 statuses, the official DAO consensus, and voter-approved versus discussion ideas. Of course, the ideas about the future are often more exciting than the process of detailed voting and approval for implementation. These ideas naturally will be discussed more as a speculation rather than the boring details of implementation. This is something we will need to learn how to deal with as a decentralized and open organization. I do not think it is just in real finance that we\u2019ll see this kind of confusion.  36:56  LongforWisdom: It is about time to move on. Thank you for a very interesting presentation. Any last comments, Luca?  37:35  Luca Prosperi: Please feel to reach out to me on the forum or Discord, very happy to chat. Thank you.   D3M Overview 38:32  Sam MacPherson: As everybody is aware, D3M was launched on Tuesday. As expected, the debt ceiling was maxed out immediately because the borrowing rate on Aave is currently quite high. There is a lot of demand to borrow stable coins. So far, so good. This will be a quick overview of D3M. There is a MIP video I did with Stanley back around May. I recommend you watch that for a detailed explanation of the workings and involved risks. I have a meme taken from my Tweet thread that explains it better well. I can go over the example. There may be an NFT for that JPEG now. Today, Primoz put up a post to raise the D3M to 50 million and lower the target interest rate to 3.9%. Currently, it is sitting at 4%. The borrower interest rate on Aave is entirely based on pool utilization. The utilization is the amount borrowed from the market divided by the total market size. The total market size is the amount borrowed plus the available DAI that is available to borrow. 80% is sort of the sweet spot for Aave, where the interest rate will move up slowly from zero to 80%. It takes a sharp point and will go up to 79% borrow rate when it reaches 100% utilization. Historically, we have seen that Aave for the Dai market hovers around this point, called the kink. The kink is at market equilibrium.  42:14  Sam MacPherson: This graphic illustrates well how the D3M works. The top bar represents an example market. The total market size is 90 million, and 80 million has been borrowed in this market, leaving 10 million available in actual Dai. If you calculate 80, divided by 90 million, you get utilization of 89%. This is higher than the 80%, the sweet spot. The variable borrow rate shoots up to 37%. This rate is super high and not desirable but often happens in bull markets. This is not good for the users. The D3M will respond by minting some Dai to return utilization to 80%. It calculates that it can make 10 million Dai and put that into the pool of available Dai. Now the calculation is 80 million total borrow divided by 100 million, which is 80%. The variable borrow rate is at our desired rate of 4%. Now, let us say some random user repays their loan of 5 million. This payment comes out of the borrowed amount and is Dai paid back by this user. This Dai is now available in the pool, ready to be borrowed or withdrawn. The total market size is still the same at 100 million, but the utilization has dropped to 75%. This results in a variable borrow rate of 3.75%, which is under what we are targeting. So again, the D3M will automatically calculate a 6.25 million withdrawal because that will give the target utilization/borrow rate of 80% and 4%, respectively. This process happens as frequently as you want. Ignoring the debt ceiling will cap the total amount admitted into the pool, keeping the utilization at 80% no matter what. However, utilization may change if it is less than the original deposited amount. Let us say the interest rate drops low, and the D3M has not minted much. If it reaches zero, it cannot withdraw more than it is entitled to. This module gives our users excellent UX when they borrow against Dai, helping us compete with USDC users who leverage Aave. If they do this calculus, they may get the maximum borrow rate of 4% on Dai. Then, why would they use USDC, which effectively has no upper bound? This is a big win. Any questions or additional comments?  45:31  Primoz Kordez: Do you want to talk about risks?  David Utrobin: Does this mechanism provide a fixed rate no matter what? Sam MacPherson: Yes, if the D3M is within the amount range and the debt ceiling, it would provide a fixed rate. However, it can drop below 4%. In addition, if the D3M runs out of Dai it has previously minted, it will not be able to pull out Dai that it does not own.  The same applies to the upper end with the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling is currently maxed. This does not affect much because the debt ceiling is 10 million, and the market size is 2 billion. The interest rate on Aave, the last time I checked, was at 8%.    46:43  Wouter: Are we still waiting for any audits or additional checks before raising the debt ceiling?  Sam MacPherson: We have received a draft of the audit; it looks good. We will wait for the final report. Also, we want a bit of time for Lindy effects. We will do this gradually; 50 million is an excellent next step. We want to wait a bit before we turn it up. Wouter: Absolutely. Thanks to the low debt ceiling, we can bring this to the market quicker. Hopefully, this is something we can continue doing in the future.    47:27  David Utrobin: I saw in the governance chat this morning some concern about Aave\u2019s overall solvency. I am curious about the risks for D3M modules. Is there a cap for our loss aside from the debt ceiling? How would it behave if a protocol were to go under a version of urgency shut down?  Nik: The risk report goes into detail about it this. It is essentially about capping the debt ceiling at a set utilization ratio. Like Sam said about the kink, when there is a steady increase of the rate on Aave hits the kink, the rate goes parabolic. Due to the kink position, there is a certain utilization amount always available to withdraw. We want D3M within or maxed at that utilization rate. This suggests that we should have an extra buffer on there as well. It comes down to how much risk Maker governance wants to take. You can get stuck in Aave due to the utilization. If you go too high on the upside with this debt ceiling relative to the kink position, you can probably extract more yield. The DAO can make more profit, but up takes more risk. Anytime you are locked in, you hold this debt and hope that Aave will not go insolvent. David Utrobin: That makes sense, thank you. I must read more in-depth about this topic.    49:43  Primoz Kordez: One of our risks is the liquidity risk. There are also a few other risks. In the liquidity risks that Nick mentioned, the maximum limit on the debt ceiling would be 20%, putting us at a 400 million debt ceiling. We would probably want more buffer. In the long run, assuming the market stays as it is, we would not suggest going over 300 million. But before we do that, there are a lot of other considerations I already wrote about a bit today. We need to address this possible increase from 50 million to prepare the community. There is the liquidity risk that we described. In addition, we have credit risk, which is how Dai is being borrowed. This is the same Dai that D3M supplies. When Dai is being borrowed, how well is collateralized, and by which assets? The credit risk is currently low because most of Dai borrowed is from so-called recursive leveraged farmers. People are essentially supplying Dai and then borrowing it. 85% of the 1.5 billion of Dai borrowed, around 1.2 billion, comprises the Dai supply and reborrowing. The Dai that is so-called risky is the other parts we borrow, roughly the 250 million. However, it is not as risky because ETH and Bitcoin mostly collateralize it. Credit risk is currently fairly low. However, credit risk can suddenly change because AAVE does not have a concept of a debt ceiling. If there is bad collateral and Oracle is manipulated similarly to the recent attack on CREAM, the collateral may be stolen on the platform. This may be probably the biggest issue I have with risk mitigation. I believe they just announced the other V3 about an hour ago. V3 should be an upgrade from V2, and they are going to implement the debt ceilings. This should be an improvement for us. Otherwise, we will need constantly need to monitor, although we do this anyway. Monitoring is important as bad collateral can create a big hole in the system. In the same way, we do a collateral risk assessment at Maker; we should do the same at Aave because we are indirectly facing the same risks. In addition to credit risk, there are also other risks, such as Oracle risk. The community needs to discuss its exposure level the sudden introduction of different Oracle types because they are currently using Chainlink. The fourth risk, a big technical risk, is that this module does not know when something is wrong at Aave and starts behaving incorrectly. Imagine a scenario where there is an exploit at Aave, and people start pulling money out. In response, the Dai supply would start draining and spiking up rates. Our module would, instead of pulling money out, would start minting more Dai in. When the rates go up, the Module starts will lower the utilization by design, behaving totally in the wrong way. We have two risk mitigants. In one mitigant, we are using the eastern Texas module debt ceiling that lowers the increase of depth ceiling. This protects us before we can shut down the module, which is the second safety procedure we can take. The safety module even has a cooldown period. Sam may know more about this. This is the biggest risk of getting high debt ceilings, plus the inability of Aave to have those ceiling constraints which they will repair.  54:40  Sam MacPherson: We do have instant access for shutting the module down. Brands can bypass the governance delay to shut down the module in an emergency. I do not know if people are aware, but we get reward steaks from Dai being deposited. So currently, those will just flow back to the pause proxy. This is an interesting transition where we are presently holding another protocol\u2019s governance token in ours. However, I do not know what we can do with this.  55:31  PaperImperium: How high do we want to go with the direct deposit module? It will compete with the PSM in monetary policy if it gets too big because it targets a rate. This competition is fine in small amounts. However, the PSM is perhaps better suited to address our peg. We do not want to risk interfering with that. I am not sure at what point this would be an issue in targeting a rate. If we get the rate wrong, then we may potentially unwind the PSM too quickly. If the PSM is empty, we would not have as many good tools as we do currently. When talking about hundreds of millions, we might need to consider taking more active management of debt ceilings from a monetary risk perspective. Although we cannot target both rates and the peg simultaneously, they may come into conflict at some point.  SebVentures: That is a good idea, in addition to trying to hard code the PSM, so there is only a certain percentage of its switches. However, I am unsure of how significant that percentage would be. This is just my top-of-the-mind suggestion.    57:41  Prose11: How feasible is it to take what we\u2019re doing with Aave and point it towards a compound?  Sam MacPherson: I have not looked at the compound extensively, but it should be roughly the same. There may be a similar kink in their interest rates. We can do it as it is not a lot of work.    58:09  Primoz Kordez: I had an idea the other day concerning our issues with long-tail tokens unprofitable to Maker due to the Oracle fees. There is a way for us to create a market that works like the Arvand compound. I am unsure when this new protocol was introduced, which is a Uniswap for lending markets. Anybody can create their pool of tokens with their compound or with a set of rules. While I am unsure how to do this through Governance, Maker could select the tokens with various parameters that would fit our risk criteria, set up this pool, then do the DTM implementation. This does not cut the Oracle fees for us, and there may be many risks, but it is a nice and scalable way to cover other tokens that you would not want to hide in the core Maker protocol.   Team Led Discussion 59:51  LongForWisdom: These modules hold a lot of potentials. Are there any other questions or comments on D3M? I believe Nadia and Burban wanted to discuss when to meet, liquidity, and market-making list. Perhaps we can come to that.  01:00:24  Andrew Burban: People are not a fan of the Wintermute deal due to various reasons. When the deal was first proposed, their strike price was $5,000. The strike price understandably pushed a lot of people off. We also never communicated to them the end of the deal. We got to close away with three deals. They are not too concerned with the strike price but instead want to partner badly with us. If this is a blocker, we can negotiate the strike price, whatever it may be. I spoke with them on the phone just recently. Some people want to see the metrics or a monthly report. I am sure they will work with us on the targets that they want. In general, we have a thin market for Maker. Scaling in or outsize would take the course of a few weeks to months. If people remember, this was the case for Poly chain with A16Z back then. Everyone has their reasons for coming in and out of Maker. They should be able to do this rather seamlessly. If they want to market sell, that should not wholly nuke the market. On the flip side, it is nice to have huge green dildos. Immediately retracing that, the price action is unhealthy within markets. It does not look good on the chart. It is not attractive to anyone who wants to invest. Some people said we could market Maker on Uniswap. That may be possible, but that is not necessarily what we are good at. There is a permanent loss, and it is a lot to manage. Wintermute is excellent at this. They currently want to market Maker so badly that they are shorting Aave to grab Maker from various places with liquidity. They are still going to market Maker but through inefficient means. The amount in question right now is 10,000 Maker. The last time I spoke to them, they wanted a $20,000 strike but are open to a $10,000 strike. In the worst-case scenario, we will sell them 10,000 Maker at $10,000 or $20,000. That would not be a huge tragedy. However, the other good thing is that they are market neutral. We are giving a liquidity provider an incentive to move Maker\u2019s price up to a higher strike in the near term. This is not the worst thing in the world. I think it would be good to take the deal. The unsecured loan has a severe reputation to defend. I am not worried that they would default on this. If they do, it would be bad to lose 10,000 Maker. However, I do not think they will. This is a risk worth taking for a necessary service they provide. In addition, we need liquid markets in the event of a solvency crisis that forces us to mint lots of Maker. Maker sold in thin books is devasting as it will nuke its price. If we have liquid books, we can sell Maker. It will still dump the price, but it will be healthier for us. I hope we can close this deal. The deal would be good for us. They are nice people and want to work with us.  01:05:43  Nadia Alvarez: The community needs to understand why we need Dai liquidity and a Maker liquidity increase. We all agree that Dai liquidity is required. However, low liquidity on Arbitrum, Polygon, or others worries me with the new change strategy. When new projects consider integrating Dai, or even Maker, they are not thinking in Dai. That is a problem. The XE and the running network launched today did not include Dai. This is terrible because we have a long-term partnership with them. It is a liquidity problem right now. Furthermore, is a protocol problem with MKR due to what we just mentioned. Simply having individuals manage MKR liquid is a very high risk. You may read all the reasons that I wrote in the forum. The next step is to close all the details for disagreements, such as the call option and the metrics. We expected that post in the forum to gain community feedback on what we should include in this deal. This deal is an uncollateralized loan of MKR, but it is based on reputation. It is something similar to, but not the same, as the Nexus institutional agreement made by using smart contracts and an executive vote. They are trusting in us, and we are trusting in them. Instead of creating a foundation with uncollateralized loans, we can start exploring how Wintermute\u2019s guys are doing with their DAOs. It will not be a problem for them to provide a DeFi and DAO service with us. That is something worth exploring. This will be the first time we have done something like this because we never gave up MKR loans. The next step will be to talk with governance and maybe SES in structuring these MIPs to help Wintermute provide a service to the DAO. I am not sure if this will be a core unit, but we need to guide them on structuring these services.  01:09:35  Andrew Burban: Peyton says we can maybe get the revenue out of the deal. I do not know how these things typically work, but it is a service, and we should be happy not to pay for it.  Nadia Alvarez: When you are a neutral market Maker, you provide the other side of the market. Of course, they will get MKR, but they will also be adding USDC, ETH, USD, Euros, or the other side of the pair. So, no does not make sense to ask for revenue.    01:10:16  Nik: We need liquidity not just on decentralized exchanges but also on centralized exchanges. The DAO could put some in Uniswap V2 or V3.  However, just because you have some on-chain liquidity, that does not mean all the basses do are covered. Look at something like a spell or magical internet money. A lot of their collateral portfolio relies on curve liquidity for the meme token. Despite some ridiculous amount of liquidity on the curve, they still went and partnered with Alameda to get market Maker liquidity on centralized exchanges. This is a two-pronged problem. Putting some liquidity in the decks will not solve these problems.  01:11:16  Nadia Alvarez: I welcome the community to post your comments on the forum. If you have any questions, send me a DM on Discord. We are open to like any of your ideas of how we can improve this agreement. We need this service. We need market Makers to help us not just with Dai but with Maker. Dai is super urgent for us right now. Due to the new side chains and layer two, we have a problem with the distribution of Dai liquidity on those chains. I do not have a solution for that while seeing the problems. Wintermute may be a solution, but I encourage others to speak on this issue.  1:12:23  SebVentures: Things are quite pushy on the Centrifuge deals because the contractual obligation is weak on risk. And so they want to start to clear them, more or less. On this one, there will be no contract at all, which seems fine. Trust is good if it\u2019s a defect by a person, but not if it\u2019s an RWA that has existed for 60 years. I think there is a bit of schizophrenia within the community on the topic. I mean, you can\u2019t get both at the same time.  1:13:12  David Utrobin: All right, so that I understand what just happened. So we moved off the topic of Wintermute. We\u2019re talking about real-world finance. Now. You mentioned I just didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure I was hearing you understand what you were saying. Can you clarify?  1:13:26  SebVentures: Yeah, I\u2019m just combining Wintermute, which is where we will learn the $30 million to, let\u2019s say, Peoples Company or NewSilver, where we are lending 10,000,000 as security. The community pushed back on the last two because there is a contractual obligation. However, people are accepting Wintermute\u2019s reputation.  1:13:56  David Utrobin: I get what you\u2019re saying. I but I think that the argument is that Wintermute has a way more embedded and large-like reputation compared to centrifuge. Like I think that\u2019s like the main reason why we\u2019re we\u2019re trusting their reputation.  1:14:31  LongForWisdom: All right, so we\u2019re reaching the end of our time together today.

My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the Governance Facilitator at MakerDAO. If you want to ask questions or have comments, please do speak up. Everyone here enjoys answering questions.   Weekly Updates  Governance  LongForWisdom 01:12  Last week has been uneventful in Governance. We had some trouble passing the week before last\u2019s executive to the point that we ended up entirely skipping last Friday\u2019s executive due to time constraints. It was not ideal. We did manage to put up the monthly MIPs executive on Monday, which passed. So we should be all set from here on out. As usual, we have an executive this Friday, which will include information from last Friday along with some other stuff. On the bright side, the executive we struggled with has finally passed. It brought some minor stability changes, DC changes and replaced the units LP token oracles with the audited versions, which is great. I am now fixing up a few minor issues. The monthly MIPs executive for May brings us to the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit. Congratulations to Juan, Wouter, and all involved. You are now officially onboarded. We also approved MIP51 with some changes to the monthly governance cycle. David has been talking about this in the MIPs updates for the last few weeks, and he will cover it again today. We will make sure everyone knows what is going on in June for the monthly cycle. Next, we passed some minor amendments to MIP0, making it more straightforward, shorter, and more easily accessible. Finally, we passed MIP50, the Direct Deposit Module presented by Sam and Stanley from Aave.   Polls and Executive  We also had one poll last week to whitelist the protocol on the WBTC-USD oracle, which passed. We will see that in an executive soon, either this week or next week. This week\u2019s executive at the release should include moving the Uniswap LPs to Liq 2.0, which is what we skipped last week. It will also include two urgent changes that we pulled on earlier this week based on the increased amount of USDC-USD collateral in the Maker Protocol combined with the market dips. Those proposed changes will be to increase the PSM USDC-A ceiling from two billion to three billion. The other urgent change makes sure we have enough space to keep the peg on $1.00 and setting the tip to 300 Dai on all types of Liq. We want to make sure Liq 2.0 runs super smoothly, even on smaller Vaults.   GovAlpha Core Unit update 04:19  For details, you can see the forum post I created. There is nothing critical or game-changing that has happened within the last week. We can check that link to have a general update on some of the things we are working on.   Forum at a Glance  Payton Rose 04:53 Forum at a Glance - Forum Thread  Three-Point Summary  A volatile week in crypto put some pressure on the peg, but things have settled back to $1.003 at the time of drafting. Our new Monthly Governance Cycle has been approved! Check out MIP51 for details. DAI Supply is back to increasing: 4.6B and counting.   856\u00d7158 27.9 KB   Announcements  There will be a couple items on this week\u2019s Executive Vote at the recommendation of @Risk-Core-Unit, adding a tip value and increasing the USDC PSM to a 3B Debt Ceiling. Congratulations to our newest Core Unit: Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling   Don\u2019t miss the upcoming AMA with William Remor 1 of Real-World Finance fame. Join Will next week, June 3 at 21:00 UTC on Zoom 1.   Discussions   [Statistics] Estimated Yearly Revenue By Vault Class   @PaperImperium shares some findings on vault revenue and usage across the various vault types.    Press Releases at MakerDAO   @Davidutro aims the topic of press releases for MakerDAO. Share your thoughts on how this important communication function can function in a DAO-space.    [Monetary Theory] Maker\u2019s Unusual Superpowers   @PaperImperium going hard to the paint this week, with this thread exploring the potential uses of Maker\u2019s unique ability to print DAI.     Signal Requests   Burn the 84k Foundation MKR   @Aaron_Bartsch asks the community if they would like to burn the 84k MKR sitting in the Pause Proxy following a break from discussion on the topic.    Should we add new PSMs?   @Aaron_Bartsch gives several options for adding new PSMs in this signal. Leave your thoughts (and votes!) on options for USDT, BUSD, PAX, TUSD, and GUSD.    New vault-type for YFI with a higher LR  One week left on @ultraschuppi 's signal for an ETH-C-like vault for the folks over at Yearn (YFI).    Adjusting Dust Parameter (2021-3)   @Monet-Supply is back with a poll for adjusting the minimum debt (dust) parameter on vaults, with options separate options for ETH-B, ETH-C, and the remaining vault types.    Protocol Treasury Meme   @Spidomo brings a competing signal for burning/minting of MKR in the Pause Proxy based on the meme factor.     Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 07:30 Protocol Engineering Monthly Review  We had an executive last week for the LP tokens, which have liquidations on are in the spell, and LP tokens that don\u2019t have liquidations who are part of the stablecoin class have their spells ready to be deployed. However, few changes came up because of last weekend. In addition, there was an urgent request and polling for the PSM USDC-A DC increase to incentivize people to participate in liquidation. We will add these two configuration changes into the spell and redeploy them, which may be going out on Friday. For next Friday, we have stablecoins planned for that executive. I was talking to Primoz on this but was not sure how the liquidation curve would look. It is heavily dependent on what we do with PSM, so there\u2019s an urgent requirement on whether or not we\u2019re going to sweep things into the PSM. Luckily, this mostly involves cleaning up only the technical debt. On the collateral onboarding side, we\u2019ve got xSUSHI evaluation out, and we\u2019re also evaluating four potential Centrifuge assets. I got one of them up in the forums today. The others are similar technical assessments, and they should be forthcoming shortly. There\u2019s a SushiJoin adapter which we want to deploy the week after the stablecoin executive; the audits are complete there, and now we\u2019re working on integration tests and making sure that works. Apart from that, there are lots of discussions going on L2/multichain strategies. There\u2019s work on the Optimism DAI Bridge. We are getting that ready for audits, including higher-level discussion for potential scaling strategies.  LongForWisdom: Any estimated dates for the L2 Optimism DAI Bridge? Kris Kaczor: I don\u2019t know if this information is public or not, but it should be in the latest blog post of Optimism. It will be in July. one more thing that we\u2019re working on is the Arbitrum Bridge, which is a similar process and will launch tomorrow.     Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 13:05  We want to get the remainder of the LP tokens, namely stable coin variants, on liquidations 2.0. We were a little bit fortunate last week because the LP token vault owners were quite active in unwinding their vaults on their own rather than letting them go to liquidations. We have never seen that kind of volume go through Liq 1.0. I would feel confident about these liquidations once they happen through 2.0. They can be immediately unwrapped and then dump on DEX before anyone needs to have the capital to purchase them.  Chris: To add, during these pullbacks, these LP tokens end up taking a ton of income from fee. They make all kinds of additional fee from people panicking and swapping through those pools, and that should, in theory, bump the oracle price which may even make them more resilient than we had originally anticipated against the liquidation so that might be our happy accident.   On the core unit, we are figuring out more on the strategy side. I think we\u2019ve talked a lot about RWAs. However, once you get into more details, then it\u2019s very important to figure out a generalized framework on valuing this stuff, How to partner with neutral parties that everyone trusts in the real world, and how to convince and price these services are few things that we\u2019re trying to figure out. The other thing that I am looking closely at is L2\u2019s such as Arbitrum, which will be launching next week. Optimism launching soon, and for Starkware, there\u2019s a generalized mainnet coming on that\u2019s not isolated for each app on its roll-up. We need to know which protocol and application are choosing what because I feel that L2s a big opportunity for oracles due to gas costs being more lenient relative to costs on L1. This allows us to step up our competitive game. We have been prepared for this; Our oracle infrastructure is blockchain agnostic. We have discussed Scuttlebutt and Lib P2P, which are on Ethereum based infrastructure pieces of the oracle setup. Everything can be the same, including contracts that can be deployed as they are now, except that we need to point relayers to Optimism or Arbitrium clients instead of the current Ethereum remote procedure call clients. We are well-positioned to deploy these within a week on the L2 chains. We can seize this opportunity.   Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 19:39  We made some parameter proposals this week, posted by Monet-supply asking for a higher dust limit. Please, vote. The other proposals made by myself introduce flat-fee reward for barking auctions of 300 Dai. The second proposal is to increase the DC for PSM USDC. If we were to have another downturn in MKR price, we may hit the PSM DC, which could escalate into something more critical. This isn\u2019t the only Risk related. The three billion DC vote passed, which means we should increase DC and bark incentive and flat fee implemented within the next executive vote tomorrow. We are also finalizing stablecoin vault Liq 2.0 parameters. Chris mentioned that we want to see the outcome poll about the PSM to understand what auction curves price makes the most sense for vaults that won\u2019t be migrated into the PSM. There is a significant difference in the floor prices set in the auction. This may take some time before we know the best recommendation. Mark published the Sushi LP evaluations. We\u2019re proceeding with evaluations of another three during this week, likely to be YFI-ETH, LINK-ETH, and DAI-ETH. SUSHI-ETH is also a potential candidate afterward. Because Sushi would be a new asset, we can also cover xSushi during the same time. Finally, next week, the Parameter Proposal Group will hold a monthly meeting to discuss some DC. The team will focus on refreshing risk premiums and recommended maximum DCs, which could be much more important this time around. We may reduce the rates due to the increase in USDC exposure. We may also increase the DC on ETH-B. I recommend tweaking some of the auction parameters for ETH-B. It could be better to have a shorter duration for vaults containing lower liquidation ratios such as ETH-B.  Christopher Mooney: Do we still think that a dust increase is still necessary since Liq 2.0 is less gas-intensive? Primoz: Monet made calculations that show we may still end up spending a lot on gas. It depends on what gas prices we want to protect ourselves and our users due to unwinding costs. LongForWisdom: Can we increase tip or parameter sets that would fall to keep dust low without exceeding the penalty percentage? Primoz: If we increase dust penalty fees, we could increase the tip. 300 tip may be a good value depending on gas prices.     Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 25:34  The Centrifuge batch will be delayed until June 18th due to the slipping of the previous executive. We had published the People\u2019s Company risk assessment last week. The Smart Contracts Team will start publishing the smart contract assessment as well. I expect that poll to be on-chain next week for onboarding. We have significantly worked on the Trust model. There was not much discussion on the 6S preliminary contract assessment, but everyone must look at it. We are making small changes to this model for other implementations like SolarX, Reinno, and all the further development that will use the Trust model. I published something like that in Real-World Finance section on the forum. We are in the process of engaging with a Cayman\u2019s specialized law firm who will help us understand the laws in the Cayman Islands. We are running a little bit late with our legal advisor, but we are still in the process. First, we need to pass some KYC. It is always tricky for those companies to work with the DAO when the customer is not a customer but is instead another party of the DAO. I published some research on designing stablecoin liquidity. There was much discussion regarding the PSM; Should we diversify? Should we have big exposure to the PSM or not? This research can be useful for some. Lastly, we are thinking a lot about the strategy for RWA. On the one hand, we no longer want any small RWA - below 50 million - by the end of the year, because it is too much work for not enough reward. On the other hand, we want to be more aligned with what we want to achieve and not just depend on what is coming to others. Maybe make some specific investments that can help the balance sheet of MakerDAO and not waiting for people to show up and limiting us to those people.   6S Update  Matthew Rabinowitz 28:55  The entire process for 6S Capital started in July last year in the middle of the global pandemic. As a result, all the banks pulled back on credit. Fast-forward to today. Banks are starting to provide credit again. We started by presenting a term sheet to the community, which Governance then approved, and the real work started. Getting information, entity formations, engaging with trustees, accountants, attorneys, etc. There is so much that has been learned in this process that sharing and disseminating that knowledge is essential for the DAO. Here is the executive summary. I continue to believe that the Trust structure is the way to scale. Delaware Statutory Trusts are the way to go with a regulated trustee: a bankruptcy-remote entity by statute does matter. The Trust structure being advanced is shielded by statute from having assets attached due to a downstream bankruptcy. There is a reason why the Delaware legislature implemented this. There is a reason why trillions on mortgage-backed securities, CMBS, and other structured products use Delaware as their preferred jurisdiction. The Delaware Statutory Trust is at the center of all of it. There is wisdom here for us to learn, and there is a reason we need to deep dive and lean into it. I can assure you that this jurisdiction was not selected by accident. The ability to know that legal standing can be defended or the case dismissed is essential. Without you, insert uncertainty and delays to what possibly could be bankruptcy. Trust sponsors can only be neutered so far before that because they are given certain powers by laws of the jurisdiction of their formation. As long as we are engaging with humans, it would help if you still had human discretion. For example, reasonable business judgment waivers for a mechanic slane that is 100 dollars on dirt from a downstream borrower. That should not blow up an entire revolver. However, technically it is a breach of a negative covenant. Waiting on a DAO to vote for that is simply unworkable. The game theory around this is important, but humans make judgment calls at the end of the day. If the DAO intends to remove the human element completely, we massively curtail the possible credit space for Maker. When it comes to lending against physical collateral, like real estate, Maker must know whom it is doing business with and have reasonable confidence in that party. There is no legal structure that can remove all risk from any lending transaction; no blockchain can do that until the day blockchain loans secured by physical assets can be enforced in a court of law directly. Even then, I am not sure we all want to live in that world. Based on the Community feedback, an updated version of some of the Trust documents and credit agreements will be provided in a form that provides further control for the DAO. Following on, everyone will want high DC. There is no doubt there will be a list of people coming up who do not yet. Over the past ten months, I have spent hours working with the Community on secured lending, and many still do not understand this law. Until the Community has that understanding, it should not extend large amounts of credit to anybody. Some have the perception that this is a technological challenge. It is not. It is a legal enforceability challenge. Getting your money back is the name of the game. For example, Maker is accustomed to near-instant Liq to collateral. However, no State permits any lender, private or not, to instantly foreclose on the collateral. Borrowers have rights as notice and the ability to cure. Some states will not permit a foreclosure for 30 days. Suppose Maker wants to accept physical collateral into the Protocol and liquidate that collateral. In that case, it can only enforce such rights through a legal process. That is meant so that both sides have a fair hearing. We have to decide if we want to be a margin line or a credit facility, i.e., revolver for the real world. We must crawl, then walk, then run, and many of us want to fly. As I have discussed with more hours than I can count with some influential and respected Community members, the trade-offs here are quite simple. It is liquidation capability to protect the Dai ecosystem and tools that incentivize refinancing, which depends largely on if there was a default by the parties downstream. In the real world, typically, lenders cannot force borrowers to repay early if the borrower is not in default. A lender that tried would be in breach of its loan agreement, and that also punishes a good lender that did nothing wrong. At the end of the day, we also have to make sure that what we are constructing is useful and competitive. What does that leave us? This is, frankly, your question. At present, we are in a holding pattern pending Dai to be added to the underlying broker-dealer. We expect that to be another couple of weeks to the New York financial services. However, after many calls and constructive comments with recommended changes to the language of the credit agreement and the trust agreement, changes are being implemented. This is hopefully going to constrain the Trust sponsor further where possible and also fixing some clerical errors. You will see some posts on the forum with red lines shortly. That said, regardless of the Community approves 6S or not, I am compelled as an MKR token holder personally to advise the Community to understand the role of a Trust sponsor fully and not bring on collateral to a protocol without diligence into the underlying LendCo and the Trust sponsor, in this case, Crestbridge, a regulated entity under the law on the Cayman islands for the 6S structure. We have a full understanding of how Maker enforces its rights in the event of a default by the borrower. Like how an LLC is either manager or member-managed, a Trust is either a beneficiary or managed by a Trust sponsor. Since the ownership of MKR is unknown and ever-changing, doing KYC on MKR is virtually impossible, at least it is today. Therefore, a Trust sponsor must manage the Trust by bringing on a Trustee, even if it is a directed Trust. Further, I am compelled to stress the significance of the Community learning the nuances of secured versus unsecured structures. Recourse and enforceability matter; legal opinions matter. We all want collateral on the Protocol, however knowing regulated parties have custody and control over the cash or the Liens at all times is essential, again: crawl, walk, run. Going back to the comments that I received from feedback that I got from the Community, some comments can be best summarized down to \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d These comments are not helpful, nor do they benefit the community as a whole. We, the DAO, the Community, must learn the nuance of how to properly manage this before we put our foot to the floor. For sure, borrowers are lining up, and every part of me says, \u201ctap the brakes,\u201d we have to learn to crawl first. I want to fly a jet, but the ecosystem is not ready for it. I am exceptionally happy to see companies, like RWA companies, stepping up for the DAO. Once the broker-dealer has been approved, we will be able to weld everything shut for the 6S structure and go to closing. We are rapidly approaching the window where all documents on Version 1 will be deemed final. Then, closing with the trustee will occur. I am spending a significant amount of time, capital in pursuing what hopefully will be shared by more than just me. I am hopeful for your vote. We have brought together world-class service providers, and every party along the way is regulated except for Maker itself. One day, even with a perfected structure, from an equity standpoint, there is a political angle that we can not deny. What we say matters; keeping our word matters. This will only be more pointed in the future. We are raising equity for structures that require the DAO to maintain confidence and legitimacy. When I reference equity, I am talking about the equity investors, who are putting the real capital at risk, including my own money, for this LendCo. There is no smart contract development that can happen that will replace legitimacy. We do that; there is no code for that. We must balance the humanity that we expect from downstream parties just the same. Specifically, one area has come up that is worth bringing up. There is no perception of failure to disclose. That is required related to the interest rate changes and the rate of interest rate changes increase. Today the transaction structure is prime plus the spread. The DAO controls that spread. I will be working with the Community to advance an index representing something more than what the Community can control, DSR plus a spread. Today we have a structure where that spread has some element of a throttle over a quarterly period. You will see those in the red lines that will be coming out shortly. As for now, the DSR plus the spread is the idea, but for now, the real world has no idea what DSR is and cannot recognize it as an interest rate index like prime LIBOR fed funds. It is an area we are working on. The broader issue is the term to which the Community can withstand to have Dai outside of its liquidation control. Today it is measured in hours, the RWA lenders are pushing for days and weeks, and 6S is pushing for a few years. As the ecosystem matures, so will the sensitivity to capital being out of the Protocol for longer. Are we ready for everyone to continually have renewing revolvers? I do not think we are yet. I have beat my head against the wall, against my counsel, against well-intended, very well-respected Community members, so much that it just hurts. This is a complicated structure, but one that is decades old in the real world. Trillions of dollars are extended and repaid annually using secured lending structures just like it. I hope the Community can see that. Which makes comments like the \u201cI don\u2019t like it\u201d ones all the more pungent and sour as it disregards and discounts the countless hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars that have been committed thus far with an unknown outcome. I very much want to get the Community\u2019s input, as these last weeks coming up are the point where I embrace the most risk and the venture into the unknown. Doing this in a decentralized way, a vacuum, with an absent counterparty is not for the faint of heart. More than ever, what is clear to me is that the power and capability that Maker wields is way more than most realize. We all want progress. Everyone is well-intended. Maker has a wonderful future ahead of it. Defaults will happen, and folks will stumble and fall; that is not interesting; it is a guaranteed outcome for some. What is interesting is what happens when we pick ourselves up as a community. While collateral will survive and thrive, who will still be standing? In addition to other Community members that reach out to me personally, we will find out a special shoutout to Gregory Di Prisco at RWA company for his countless hours thus far. Providing constructive feedback and recommending language changes to the documents has helped the DAO in incalculable ways. He has done so respectfully and in a principled and sometimes painfully firm way. I found this collaboration and engagement invigorating. We are very lucky to have him in the Maker Community.   Questions  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Can you share the timelines you are envisioning going forward? What I understand is that some people do not like RWA at all. It is not constructive at all, so it is not super important but going forward, as you want to amend, the timeline. Also, I understand that some people prefer to go privately. However, I think some construction should happen in the public forum as I am not sure it is the best way to do everything on a peer-to-peer basis. It is not for you; it is for the community members as well.  Matthew Rabinowitz: Regarding the time, as I mentioned, we have received feedback, we are processing that now, and I expect to be posting red lines hopefully by the end of the weekend, if not the beginning of next week. Probably give the Community another week or two weeks to digest all of them and then close. Presently, the broker-dealer and the department of financial services in New York are still constrained by the critical path.   Wouter: Since there seem to be some constraints simply in the complexities and the nuances and everything that the community needs to learn, because if we are going to operate a real bank, then there is a profession to be learned, is there anything that can be done to help unblock and increase the speed at which the information is decimated, and people start understanding the important points that need to be understood?  Matthew Rabinowitz: Short answer is that being a senior secure lender is an art, not precisely a science, and we have to start small and slow, and it is frustrating because everyone wants it to go faster. I would treat every one of the Dai that would be minted as if it were my own. As I am a fiduciary over the equity, I always have to do what is in their best interest. That part being said, there is no good way to skip to how we can take this to billions without learning how to crawl. There is a process we all will be intimate in this have to go through, and there is no shortcut. There is a shortcut, which is doing it too fast; doing it with losses and losses is a very painful way to learn. Wouter: The question was specifically about helping to educate rather than speed up the process itself, but that would amount to speeding it up further down the line, I would think. Matthew Rabinowitz: The best way to do it is to continue to have weekly calls with folks that want to ask questions. In the week before this, I had set up multiple windows for folks to dial into ask-me-anything sessions, and we had very little participation. There is a challenge between \u201cwe all want it to work\u201d and \u201csomebody else is going to do it.\u201d The only way to learn this is by participating. David Utrobin: Do you think it would be a worthy investment to hire more professionals that are intimately aware of these structures and have had previous experiences, like setting up the Delaware Trust structure, etc., or do you firmly believe that this is a crawling thing. There should only be one or two or three cooks in the kitchen? Matthew Rabinowitz: I do not proclaim to have a shortage of LendCos. We may need to have more of them; it should not be only me; that is not my objective as far as hiring professionals with the DAO, sure that that can hurt. Regarding the world-class team we pulled together, at least on my end, I do not proclaim to know the enforceability of these contracts; that is why we are having enforceability done. For stability opinion done by basically the best firm that does and has a premier Trust section in Delaware representing Wilmington Trust Company and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, these are the folks that issue legal opinions for multi-billion-dollar mortgage-backed securities. They know the law. As far as getting other people involved, I am 100% for it. S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: To add, we will spend more than 10.000 Dai just to review the Cayman part, and I am still waiting for a quote for the rest.     Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 46:22 Growth CU Weekly Updates  This week was super interesting. We are starting to have deeper conversations with the Polygon team to see what else we can do together. Bartek from the engineering team joined oracle, and he talked to them, so we would see if we could do something else together. We are also talking with the team to see what we can do for our partners interested in integrating Dai on Polygon to help them so that they can offer this layer to solution to their users. We are also starting to talk with Solana to prepare everything for a Dai and Solana launching in a month or so. This is great because we are talking with other projects that are on top of Solana so that they can have these Dai on Solana as well. That is regarding other networks and L2s. We saw the post by Derek in the forum. It will be awesome to all participants on what to do if we want to see Maker growing in other networks and L2s. We all know that it is important; we all know that Dai has to be everywhere, but also, and thank you to other Core Units that are cautious and taking care of all Dai users. The Smart Contract team\u2019s research is super important for us because they are giving us a lot of feedback and input so we can understand what is happening in all these other networks. We know there is much adoption, but we also have to be careful about what could happen in the future. Furthermore, we are having conversations with these important users of the Maker Protocol because we want to know what they think about Maker Vaults and improve the way they are using our Vaults. We want to mint more Dai, and we know that these institutional Vaults - custom Vaults - are important so that Maker can get bigger. We had a conversation with NEXXO. We will be having another one with Celsius, Savvy, Fireworks, and companies like that. As soon as we have more information and everything is digested, I will post something in the forum to tell you all about this and the feedback we are getting from them. The star of the week was India. We see much adoption of crypto, although they are struggling with all the regulators. However, that has been the trigger to start all this interest around crypto. We are working closely with ZebPay and EPNS, and we are trying to create a product so that people in India could be more attracted to use Dai on those platforms. We see much potential in this country because there are about 340 startups doing something related to crypto, so it is a great opportunity for us. All of this was led by Jocelyn Chang, who is in charge of the Asia growth strategy.   Questions  Frank Cruz: I am not sure if you can disclose this but, are there any conversations with more TradeFi companies? I am seeing many headlines about the \u201cnormal\u201d people like PayPal, Venmo, and maybe some of them that I have never heard of from South America or Asia. Are you having any conversations like that?  Nadia Alvarez: We reached out to companies like the ones that you mentioned. Usually, they look for more regulated stablecoins like USDC. We are also talking with Paxos, trying to figure out what can be done in that sense. That is why we wanted to understand these Institutional Vaults. We want to understand what companies like Nexxo, who have huge Vaults in ETH and Bitcoin with us, need. We need first to have a product that these institutions would use, and then we can go and look for these institutions to use that product. Because, for now, the way we decide the risk parameters is not because we are thinking about these huge institutions that are going to put their crypto treasuries in the Vaults. However, we are more thinking about how the market is. After these conversations with Nexxo and others, I expect that we can better understand what they are looking for. Then we have a more customized product for institutions. Of course, we also have restrictions because these institutions are looking for something more regulated. Dai is centralized, so it is not necessarily what they are looking for. We are trying to figure out if a third party could provide services to them using the Maker Protocol in the back. Frank Cruz: That is good stuff. Are there any wallet providers that can help Dai grow in areas like Mexico or Central America that you can name that maybe we have never heard of? I am trying to figure out if people in Latin America are using things I have never heard of. Nadia Alvarez: Yes! I posted in the forum how Dai is used in Latin America. You can find different wallets. Wallets that are, for example, exclusively for Dai. But we are having a big problem with gas fees. We are trying to solve different things in parallel. We have to help our partners integrate their solutions and integrate Dai on an L2. We are also trying to figure out how to have this product that could serve the needs that Institutional Companies could have if they decided to open a Vault with us. We are also trying to find a third party who could help us as the frontend with the institutions if they need something more regulated. We are trying to figure out how to manage everything. I promise you that I will try to post something about different wallets that integrated Dai and all the efforts they are making to integrate Dai on Polygon, for example, to provide a solution to these users using Dai daily. We are waiting for Optimism because we want to do something with our partners to help them integrate this Dai and reach more retail users. \u200b     Content Production Update  Seth Goldfarb 56:22 Content Production Biweekly Updates  We have been working with Amy and Anna on getting ownership of the Community portal, and we have got a plan to get the site transferred over to a new domain in a way that preserves the SEO. So we are working on getting everything moved over there. That is awesome because it means that we will have a hub for all of our educational content. It has a strong SETO, and the CMS has been designed to make it easy to integrate contributions from the Community. I have already reached out to a handful of people about how the content will be reorganized there, but if anyone has any concerns about the way different parts of the Protocol are presented on the portal currently, please reach out. We can talk about what we can do to improve that. The Foundation is still doing a legal review of properties like Twitter, Telegram and Linkedin, and even analyticsmakerdao.com. We are still communicating with them about getting those properties transferred over to the Community. In the meantime, we have a couple of events coming up. We have an AMA series that we are going to be doing. The first one is on June 3rd with William Remor from Real-World Finance. If you have any questions about that, we will love to see you there. If you cannot make it, we will be posting recordings on video, audio, and transcript afterward. Matthew Rabinowitz, I was not aware of your AMA. However, I will reach out afterward and see if we can put that on the calendar and do something to help make it a little more prominent. We will also be doing a series called \u201cWhat the world is doing with Dai?\u201d. This is a replacement for the Community call that David Utrobin used to host. The purpose is to spotlight integrations and all the cool ways that people are using Dai. The first one will be with CurioInvest. They have made it possible to invest in tokenized collectible cars using Dai. We will have more information about that in the forum soon. We have hired a part-time designer who is going to be helping us out. If anyone has any design-related needs, please reach out, and we will see what we can do. Thanks to Bourbon for helping us find her. We are very excited to be working with her. We are also starting to look for a Community Manager, a  blog editor, and someone to handle video production. If anyone has candidates that might be good for that, please send them our way. We have a post in the forum about a mascot for MakerDAO. Some conversations about this started a few weeks ago, and there has been much input. Now the capibara and the dragon are looking close. Please vote for that.   Operational Support Update  Amy Jung 1:00:10 Operational Support Final Weekly Update  A few announcements:  Operational support is officially dissolving by the end of this month. First, we provided support to Core Units, but now the projects have been handed off. So I will be officially offboarding as a fascilitator, and onboarding Juan in my replacement for SES. The calls will continue. This forum link provides details on projects if you want to present. The next Pod Session is with Nick on June 2nd. I recommend looking at the resources and discussions for Core Units at the bottom of the forum post. Part of the foundation dissolution, community development will be sunsetting as of May 31st. I began as a contributor in Com Dev over two years ago. I now think of Community Development as a door for people to get more involved with MakerDAO. There will be more formal communications in the future. I am proud of the team and our accomplishments. When I took this role, I told role, I couldn\u2019t have imagined that we would now have an entirely decentralized community involving up to nine facilitators. Next week will be my final week at Maker. The experience I had here was the most unique and fascinating experience of my life, which gave me so much insight into the future of technology and organization. It is unfortunate for me to leave at such a prosperous time at Maker. However, I am confident that MakerDAO will continue to have exponential growth. I am leaving with a full heart of love and confidence.   Everyone: So sad. Please don\u2019t leave us, Amy.   Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling  Juan Guill\u00e9n 1:05:00  I wanted to thank everyone in the name of the whole team. We were celebrating online earlier today, and we are very excited to start next week. We were very happy to join everyone officially, and hopefully, we can start providing value as soon as possible. Regarding Amy, it is sad that she decided not to continue with us. We will all miss her and miss her presence. But, unfortunately, she said no amount of Dai or MKR could make her stay and then smashed the door on her way out, so we have to live with that.

Rema: Currently, we do not follow on-chain balances, only for Uniswap and Sushiswap liquidity, but we do have this on our agenda \u200b   Burning Foundation MKR  Andrew Burban 1:33:10  As some of you may have read, we proposed a pre-MIP to spark a discussion about the Maker Burn. I have a light understanding of how we burn. It is not entirely random; it is called the lerp function, and we sometimes burn at optimal times or suboptimal times. The idea would be to have something in place to reduce the overhead if there is any burning, otherwise we should not be burning. It would be an automatic thing that burns more Maker when it becomes a more optimal burn. Tom has been working with a friend to develop a strategy to counter the trade market. We have had reasonable success with it. The signals are very good; it is a matter of whether or not we listen to them, which we are working on. They apply very well to other coins created on the market. We can work on something that can be used for burning MKR as well. The price is going up, and you may not want to burn there, but if the market is scared, maybe that is a better time to burn. Last week was a good example of when we have been burning more. Although we maybe should not have been burning the moment MKR began dropping. We could have burned a little bit and then crank burning as we fell more and more. There could be many ways to approach that. Some people mentioned that when the P/E gets below a certain reef. We would be using something to identify whether the price of MKR is undervalued or just that the whole market, in general, is in a state of fear or panic. You can increase the burn during those periods and reduce burn when it is not necessarily optimal. We can have Dai that would be going towards the burn on standby. We want to burn much of the surplus buffer, 25% going right now, to get within the realms of however much we set aside towards burning continuously. Some of it can go through a DCS-type strategy. The original suggestion of this involved short interest data, which is what we trade against. When people are shorting, they get really scared of the market once they maximize shorts, and typically those will mark low points. They will at least mark a local minimum if not a global minimum in price. It tends to line up well for protecting these points and could be a good place to increase the burn. When everyone is scared, without knowing what the price is or what direction the market is, you can probably identify that this might be a better place to burn, probably at a local minimum. You do not necessarily need to know what the price is.   1364\u00d7892 130 KB   Tom: This is an example of one metric we could use. I strongly recommend that we do not use only one metric in order to prevent potential manipulation. A simple metric like funding a loan, even an unrefined version of it, gives you a very tactical and metric-based strategy. It is like a data-based way to know when to burn so you are not leaving it up to human emotions and semantics. This is one sentiment base indicator, but there are a lot more. Glassnode and CryptoQuant have a nice selection of them. We have some Maker specific ones, like P/E. Suppose we had a small team of people working together on this. In that case, we could develop the right metrics and how to analyze them in a tamper-proof way, where the amount of money it would cost to manipulate the market to get us to burn would be ludicrous enough to potentially not happen. This is just one example of something that we could easily build and make it successful. Our backtest worked well; I did not want to blow everyone\u2019s mind. This is just an example of how it would be performed on the dip here. If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask me.  Andrew: Those three levels exhibit where we increase how much we are burning. We might have a constant type of return, but we would start increasing the amount of burn once we hit a signal. As the market starts getting euphoric, you may want to reduce how much you are burning.   Tom: We do not want to use open interest because that can be unfair to shorts, but it was one metric that we could use to gauge market sentiment.  LongForWisdom: I encourage everyone who has any ideas or comments on this topic to go to the forum\u2019s thread and leave their thoughts there.

My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the Governance Facilitator at MakerDAO. I\u2019m joined by a host of Maker enthusiasts. I\u2019ve noticed participation pick up a bit. If you want to comment or interrupt, please feel free. We like when people get involved. Please remember about daylight savings. However, most people have already gone through it in the UK, and possibly for others, it is coming up. Be aware that daylight savings time may affect your time for when this meeting happens. We have the standard agenda today, including some discussions, deeper discussions happen in the Forum.   Governance Update LongForWisdom 02:10  We\u2019ve had two executives in the last week. We had the regular Friday weekly executive and the monthly MIPs executive. Both of those have passed. Last Friday\u2019s executive contained increases to the maximum DC for ETH-A and WBTC-A. We set the maximum DC for ETH-A at 15 billion in hopes that we won\u2019t have to touch that in the near future. The WBTC-A maximum DC moved to 750 million, which should cover us for the meanwhile. We also set the debt floor(dust) on most Vault types from 2000 to 5000 Dai, except for ETH-B and non-standard Vault types such as PSM and RWAs. The monthly MIPs executive had a lot of stuff in it. All of which has passed. This included the Core Unit Framework, which passed three of the first Core Units, technical MIPs such as The Keg, Term Lending Module, and Liquidations 2.0. we also passed guidance for MIPs in the Multisignature Wallet Management MIP and the Parameter Proposals Group\u2019s MIP. This week\u2019s polls are finished. We had a poll for ETH-B dust, which was accidentally left out from last week. That poll ended with Maker holders agreeing to change the dust fee from 2000 to 15000, higher than the other Vault types but not yet implemented until the weekly executive vote. I was devoted to increasing the system surplus lot size, also known as the bump parameter, from 10k to 30k. Also, Governance voted to increase the DC and turn on the DC Instant Access Modules for some of the Uniswap LPs, specifically Dai, USDC, and Dai-USDC. If all goes well this Friday and the executive passes, we should see those DCs rise. Here is a brief update on what my Core Unit has been doing.  We\u2019ve continued working on a project Compass. You guys continue to take the lead and manage that process. We\u2019ve seen an update to the MIPs portal which hasn\u2019t been pushed to the production site yet, but we have it on staging; We\u2019ve been fixing the MIPs content to make sure it all displays correctly. We hope to push that to production by the next week. We\u2019ve completed a stage of rewriting of MIP0, which will go through the Monthly Governance cycle. We should see that show up in the forum soon, as RFC, where it can be discussed. This rewriting concerns cutting down word count and making things more clear. Huge thanks to @blimpa for working on that. He\u2019s doing a great job.    Weekly Updates Governance at a Glance Elihu 06:30 Governance at a Glance: March 19 - 25  Dai Summary  Since the beginning of this year, DAI supply grew from 1.1B to this week\u2019s ATH of 2.9B. We are setting on the way of 3B DAI and I want to congratulate everyone on this call for making this happen. Regardless of the rise in demand, DAI manages to keep its peg: the volume-weighted average price is at $1.002 for this week.   ICYMI - Announcements  All 97 initiatives in the MakerDAO ecosystem (including community calls, grants, products, teams) are now collected in one place, thanks to @amyjung. Also from the Operational Support Team comes the Call for Proposals program, serving to identify and fill any needs of MakerDAO. The Project Compass working group is now official. Their task is to establish a framework for future vision setting in the DAO.    Discussion Threads   Emerging global AML/KYC framework and DeFi (and Maker)   @Jacek raises the issue of KYC regulations as they relate to MakerDAO.    Should we burn the admin keys? An argument for minting MKR  Building on previous discussions, @juan advocates for a joint effort to discuss contributor compensation and potentially form a working group to tackle the issue of minting MKR for vesting purposes.    Signal Request Threads   Petition Letter to A16z  Following a previous discussion, @iammeeoh is looking to gather consensus around a petition for a16z to get involved in governance.    Adjust the Surplus Buffer (March/April 2021)   @ultraschuppi is looking for consensus on raising the Surplus Buffer and potentially burning some MKR from fees.    Smart Contracts Team Update Christopher Mooney 08:56  We\u2019re not doing collateral onboarding right now. The collateral priority sheet work and collateral assessments are on hold while we work on liquidation 2.0, MIP45 We\u2019ve been working with Centrifuge on MIP22 and finished reviewing the Manager. We\u2019re taking the Manager from MIP22 and putting it in the MIP21 conduit. We reviewed that code; however, it\u2019s typically like a black box for us. The way we want to think of MIP21 is that once we\u2019ve created the urn(vault type) and send Dai off to the conduit, the protocol will be giving someone a loan with the belief that the loan will be repaid. We did look at the Manager, and we\u2019re confident in their team. The code looked good to us. Nonetheless, the Smart Contracts team can\u2019t guarantee whether or not that code is working. We\u2019ve discussed this with them. They are taking responsibility for whatever loan Governance decides to give and whatever DC is there. The following steps involve reworking the new deploy script for MIP21 to deploy their code more generically. Then they have to construct a spell that is a template off the MIP21 spell. Then they will do a bunch of RPC simulation tests as a result of that. We will deploy it to Kovan next week, and the code will be tested. There\u2019s been a lot of improvements to the spell readability. We\u2019ve also been trying to make the Etherscan verify more usable and friendly for Governance and ourselves. It\u2019s becoming difficult for us to validate the spell on-chain. We\u2019re trying to use the API and break that up and make it easier to review. We\u2019ve been working on fee-charging tokens like PAXG or USDT when they turn fees on. This requires work on the proxy actions. We will hand that off to UI to add those types of tokens and cycle back to PAXG once we\u2019ve finished that work. Echidna tests for the L2 Optimism DAI bridge were run and got auditors engaged for the Sushi join adapter. ABDK(audit firm) is going to take a look at that. This is like \u201ccrop join\u201d, basically a simpler version of the crop join adapter because Sushi rewards are very simple. This also means we could add additional bits for crop join. There is work on DSS-autoline-readme. Many updates came back from ABDK on the LP oracle audit; No significant issues were found, and we\u2019re ready to replace oracles already there. Also, Uniswap v3 is coming out, so we will see how useful those oracles will be. We also had updates in Kovan with pricing. For MIP45, LIQ 2.0, as we construct the spell for Kovan to integrate this into the existing Kovan deploy, which is like a staging environment for the main net. We\u2019re seeing that there is a lot of minutiae in there. For example, we have a PR for dust consistency and the circuit breaker change that\u2019s going to be in the main code. Two PRs are going to happen. We\u2019ve got the clipper mom that we discussed last week, which we\u2019re going to update to act as an instant module to circuit break the auctions. We had to change to the ilk registry, the Dss Exec lib, the emergency shut down module. We\u2019ve got DSS interfaces in there, and we also need to update the MIP45 doc. We will have a PR that will go out with a few minor changes suggested by auditors and clarifications. This should not invalidate MIP45.   1391\u00d7795 263 KB   Highlighted line is where we are today. We\u2019re pushing the final Kovan deployment to the 31st. Our entire timeline was moved forward by about a week. LINK will be the first to go out, on the 9th followed by YFI.   Parameters for LINK were posted.   Regarding centrifuge, MIP 22 could possibly go out on the 17th, 30th, or the 6th. Keepers and UIs seem like they should be ready on time.  Questions  Chris: Any questions?  LongForWisdom: I have a request related to MIP21 and MIP22. It would be great if we will have documentation of those parameters, which include parameters for Governance and other stuff. Chris: We have to set the token price that we create for them based on the DC. We will update that.   Christopher Mooney: The risk team put a lot of work into the parameter selection, and people should review them.  LongForWisdom: I recommend anybody from Governance who has a large stake in the system to give this a review and discuss it.    Oracle Team Update Nik Kunkel 23:00  Collateral Onboarding is stalled due to the busy schedule of the smart contracts team. We\u2019re wrapping our head around the Uniswap v3 update concerning the idea that liquidity is not fungible anymore. This is because you can dynamically deploy your liquidity into various ranges rather than one large continuous range. Instead of putting liquidity directly into Uniswap v3, you need middleman contracts to deploy a common strategy and issue people a token. That middleman contract will then deploy that liquidity into Uniswap. The contract can be adjusted. The thing that matters is the token represents a common chunk of the liquidity that\u2019s uniform. The question is, who is responsible for the execution side of these things? There is a lot of competition right now to be a lender to LP tokens. The issue is that everybody is rushing to make their own token resulting in fragmentation of total liquidity. All tokens should have shared liquidity and integration, but it\u2019s not the case right now. I\u2019m currently speaking with AAVE and Uniswap, and other guys concerning this issue. Hopefully, we can have a gentleman\u2019s agreement. I\u2019ve been working on the Oracle core unit. I am targeting to submit that by May 1st, 2021. This would give governance a month to review and discuss it and then give feedback before we go live in the June MIP cycle to be voted on at the end of June.  Risk Team Update Primoz Kordez 28:53  We are making a framework for evaluating DCs of UNI LPs. I know it\u2019s not complicated. Still, we need to make sure there is UNI-ETH. We need to aggregate the full UNI DC that we have at Maker and check the limit. We need to make calculations and determine a new DC for the underlying tokens. Then we need to combine it into one aggregate DC for UNI and UNI-ETH. We should have this soon. Marcus is working on that. We released a proposal for the LINK-A Liquidation 2.0 parameters. Please, read it before it goes to the on-chain poll. In addition, Gauntlet published their report; I made a few comments on their proposal concerning the initial starting price parameter called Buf. We suggest applying a higher buf to prevent the expected auction duration from being too short. Otherwise, we\u2019re planning to make a similar proposal next week, starting with the YFI-A vault type and then proceed to other assets. The parameters won\u2019t differ much among Vault types apart from one parameter called ilk.hole. This parameter limits the number of pending liquidations per Vault type. It\u2019s similar to the box parameter under the current implementation. Still, this limits Vault-type pending liquidations, which helps us limit auction throughput per collateral. We also made a few new tools to measure risk metrics. One of them being on-chain slippage for collateral assets that are held at Maker. This actually helped us address one of the main parameters for liquidations 2.0, which is this auction throughput parameter called ilk.hole. It also helps us during discussions about DC, risk premiums, and such. However, this is still in beta; It\u2019s a work in progress. I suggest taking a look, and please provide feedback. We expect to list more metrics in the next few weeks. Then the ultimate plan is to have a live evaluated risk metric calculated for the whole Maker portfolio. This way, the community or any other risk analysts can observe MakerDAO portfolio risk in real-time. This helps us with DC, risk premiums, and even surplus buffer debates. Besides working on these tools, I\u2019m making additional proposals for the liquidations 2.0 parameters.  LongForWisdom: Chris mentioned the target for the executive is the 9th. The Governance\u2019s plan would be to vote on Monday\u2019s parameters before the target, the 5th. This gives governance time to perform documentation of the parameters we\u2019ve been working on. It also leaves time for comments in the forum.    Real World Finance Team Update Sebastien Derivaux 34:23  On the collateral side, we\u2019ve made progress with sub-collaterals such as People\u2019s and Harbor Trade Credit. The big news is that we will soon have NewSilver on-chain thanks to the Smart Contracts team and Centrifuge\u2019s work. To add to what @cmooney has said, we will make a DC for Tinlake, a system that will generate money from the Vault. We will use it as soon as it needs money to invest in one property because it\u2019s a real estate collateral. We expect them to take some Dai. As soon as a new investor invests in Tinlake, the contract will automatically push Dai back into the Vault to repay the debt or some of it. We will see if it works as expected. On other news, we had a Core Unit presentation last Friday available on Youtube, discussing what RWF is. We\u2019ve made some progress on the analytic front. The financial statement of MakerDAO that I made on Dune Analytics is no longer working because it no longer supports the pivot table presentation. I spoke to them, and we may remake it in the future. I don\u2019t know when. I had meetings with many people from the Foundation on Vulcanize and other data stuff to take some expertise they have and work on a more robust solution that\u2019s not depending on a third party. Lastly, I\u2019ve made a budget dashboard simulator that I published on the forum. It\u2019s a simulator where you can add more Core Units to see what happens if you increase targets, Dai in circulation, leverage ratio, how much MKR token you want to give to all the team, and the split between teams. It\u2019s a simulator, so you can fork it as much as you want and make changes.  Operational Support Update Amy Jung 38:00  I posted the forum version of this update where you can follow all these links. If you scroll down to discussions, that\u2019s what @juan and I have been working on a lot this week. There isn\u2019t a Know Your MIPs call, and, as we know about the collateral onboarding, there are no calls this week or the next. We do have one in two weeks, which is Bancor. We have done three launch pod sessions with Core Units: Smart Contracts, Real World Finance, and Content Production, which is what we did yesterday. All three are now up on YouTube. Accountable came back for the community call that @Davidutro has run, so you can watch that relating to their various services. The next call we have is next Wednesday. We have two calls back to back. One of them is Otonomos and OtoCo.io, which is different if you are trying to pay your contributors. That\u2019s another core unit tool if you are looking for some options for your Core Unit. Following them is the very hotly debated Framing a Framework for MKR\u2019s compensation call. This is where we will have discussions around MKR vesting, all piled into one. Try not to bring pitchforks; instead, try to bring intellectually stimulating questions and good energy. It is a debate around various perspectives. In terms of the Core Units and development, we have quite a few. Today Kathleen posted the Strategic Marketing/Communication\u2019s Core Unit. It is slightly different from the Content Production Core Unit. Still, some overlap may be there. There were questions regarding the Content Production side that might overlap. Feel free to give it a read. Also in RFC are Growth, Smart Contracts, Content Production, Governance Communications, and MakerDAO shop. No changes for new drafts. There are some interesting conversations. There is one where I summarize all the topics in the Smart Contracts thread concerning incentives, budgets, vesting, and so on. @juan reproposed and framed a great way to talk about MKR specifically. Check that thread out. Many of the conversations there are what we want to discuss in the call that is happening Wednesday. He also posted vital functions not covered by current Core Units. Which is really important. We are developing from the bottom up, and there might be critical things, such as responsibilities or functions, that we might not be able to see right now. Still, in the transition after, the solution may be missing. I did post a Core Unit\u2019s feedback discussion thread. If you have general feedback around the framework on how Core Units are being developed or anything like that, feel free to leave your thoughts and comments there. We proposed a new framework called \u201cCall for Proposals.\u201d this was done because people who are not ready to jump straight into a Core Unit might want to run some proposals. If you have an idea, you want something to happen, but maybe you are not the person that wants to run it; you might just propose, \u201cHey, can we get some Call for Proposals around this?\u201d. Community Development just proposed one for grants. Anybody interested in potentially running a Grant Core Unit is just exploring some ideas around what grants, large or small, could happen inside the DAO. You can go ahead and propose. It\u2019s a very commit-less way. You are just proposing an idea. If you want to further pursue it into a Core Unit, you totally can. This also gives us some feedback points for various different proposals. Then, we have the summary of these 97 initiatives from the MakerDAO Community. I saw some great feedback and iterated on it. It is a v1 resource. That\u2019s why it\u2019s on the notion, just to get the information out there. If you want to drive it or look for a different way this can be done, please chime in and reach out. I want to share one thing. I just got off a call with a senior in high school. She and her friends talk about MakerDAO and its power on economics in her AP class, which is so crazy. She was also saying that there is a lot of impactful things the DAO can do. Keep that in mind! Stories like that remind us that we really do cool stuff for lots of generations.  Community Development Team Update Anna Kryukova 44:24  This week, Sam joined the Community Call that @Davidutro runs to talk about the Optimism DAI bridge. We have a resource for all the initiatives that are going on in community development. We\u2019ve been working with individuals in small groups joining some of the projects in the core community development team, working on evaluating various projects in the pipeline and the different deliverables that are still being worked on in the community development small teams.

It was successful. In general, we passed everything we wanted to pass. We saw that the combined mixed bundled poll did not see a lot of participation, around 11000 to 12000 MKR. Still, some of the inclusion polls saw a lot of participation. The Term Lending Module had the most participation, which ended up getting to 95000 MKR. It\u2019s more than what we usually see. A lot of the others hit around 30000 or more. We see that participation happens for specific things that people want, which you would expect, and vice versa. It\u2019s difficult to draw conclusions from that. It\u2019s interesting how it varies over the different Inclusion polls in the various stages.   Discussion  LongforWisdom: This is the chance to discuss last month\u2019s Governance cycle or next month\u2019s Governance cycle. Does anyone have any comments?  SamM: I\u2019ve noticed that it got close to the expiry date of this month\u2019s monthly executive spell. For those who don\u2019t know, in the monthly spell, there are four days before the spell will deactivate itself and can\u2019t be passed anymore. We have a tight time frame with that. However, it passed this month. In the future, what if in these four days we have a whale who\u2019s away or something like that. We can have circumstances of voter apathy and result a monthly executive to not pass. I\u2019m concerned about the stage we are at, in relation to triple voting to get things through. It might be a bit conservative for how quickly we need to move. For example, if one of these monthly executives doesn\u2019t go through, it would be bad. We would have to push back the Core Units forming by a month or two and be forced to rework some stuff. Of course, it could not pass for reasons that people don\u2019t want it to pass. I\u2019m worried more about the case where people are 100% voted for it to go through but come across a voter apathy issue. We may want to consider suspending the monthly MIPs ratification section going forward. We can\u2019t do it right away but suspending that for the time being while we are in this rapid growth phase combined with this voter apathy phase is something to consider. Right now, we have an inclusion poll, a bundle poll, and we have an executive vote. That\u2019s three-levels of things that need to go through. Most of them usually get near 100% approval, which is why I\u2019m worried about shooting ourselves in the foot with this issue. CPSTL: I agree that it could result in some problems concerning the four-day-limit. Earlier this week, on the Governance domain call, we have spoken about potentially coming up with a new way to model the MIP3, aka the Governance Cycle, and make it more flexible for future approach. We could have an weekly open call on the Governance topics to chat about potential improvements to the Governance Cycle. Still, I want to hear people\u2019s opinions on suspending it in the interim. LongForWisdom: echoing Sam\u2019s points, really, especially with the relationship with the final executive and how that can sometimes suffer from voter apathy; We have weekly executives every Friday. Once a week is not the best we can do but pushing for greater frequency becomes risky in terms of participation and the amount of MKR on the hat dropping. We\u2019ve been aware that it is not ideal to have three in a 10-day-period or something of that number. In the past these things have came down to the wire. This cycle ended up being alright, but it\u2019s been a lot more on edge in previous cycles. Yes, it may be something that we should consider adjusting. We have the set of three polls going on because we have the executive at the end. For example, the second bundle poll is there because we have the executive. The advantage is that if you decide that the executive isn\u2019t needed, you get rid of the need for that second poll as well, which leaves you with just one. Most would agree this is probably better. The downside to losing the executive is that currently, the MIPs are hashed and stored on the blockchain in that spell, which is meant to be the immutable record of what MKR holders have voted for in case there\u2019s confusion or contention later over what was agreed upon. To be honest, we hash a lot of things such as polls, and we hash the executives. There\u2019s bever been a case where someone has said, \u201clet\u2019s go back and look at the hash and figure out what we have agreed on because I\u2019m confused and don\u2019t remember, or it was wrong\u201d. It could be overkill at this stage, right? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a hefty cost to keep paying for something that has never happened yet. CPSTL: In addition to that, the Inclusion polls filter out the individual proposals, and then the Governance poll is the bundled poll where everyone agrees on these. Suppose you were to take out the executive, that allows the Domain Teams to take those proposals without the need of implementation, and then take them on a one-on-one basis. You could have bundled them in the future. In that case, they are a technical proposal that requires an on-chain action. The hashing aspect would only apply to the technical proposals and not the more process-oriented ones. LongForWisdom: Yes, as Charles said, we discussed this last week because Sam reached out to me as well. There\u2019s a couple of ideas we have concerning how we could adjust things. I\u2019m less keen on the idea of suspending it, and more leaning towards adjusting it because I think suspensions get weird. You suspend things and everyone gets used to it, and then it becomes the way you do things. Still, it\u2019s less legitimate because it\u2019s a temporary thing that was supposed to be a temporary change. There is also the complicating factor of the DssGov coming up as well, which slightly changes the monthly cycle requirements. We would want to build something that we know will work with that as well. We are going to think about it over the next few days. We are going to try and push a proposal out before April 7th, which could mean going into the May cycle to start implimenting in June. We will think about it a little bit next week, and we\u2019ll maybe discuss it again during the next Governance Call. SamM: Chris brought up a good point. There are security considerations for these quick succession votes. The MKR on the hat gets dangerously low during the monthly executives due to the rapid turnover. LongForWisdom: A couple of people are mentioning rapidity of things as well, and I want to avoid making the multi-cycle because we already have Governance processes that are faster if we really need to do things more quickly. Making the cycle shorter isn\u2019t necessarily a good idea because we already have tools that manage the shorter turnaround. But I completely agree with the points you\u2019ve made concerning security and the fact you have to write it three times is annoying. Brian McMichael: From a Smart Contracts\u2019 perspective, we run these monthly polls through the pause proxy as well. There\u2019s a chance for something to get slipped in there; it\u2019s not completely safe. Just keep that in mind. We are not actually changing anything in the system. Maybe we don\u2019t need to be running it through the pause proxy? LongForWisdom: Yes. This will also involve several hours of work for Smart Contracts, others, and for myself. We will consider it next week and potentially give an update in next week\u2019s Governance call.     Other Presentations and Updates  Sebastien Derivaux  Budget Simulator 1:02:20 MakerDAO Budget Simulator  I just put back the MKR rates. I removed them to initiate any discussion. This is just a model. All the numbers are fake. If you want to play with it, go to the \u201cfile\u201d and make a copy to modify the parameters. You can modify all those parameters that are in yellow and orange. There are two components. One, which is a budget; it\u2019s we decide as a community that we want to make as expenses for the year. You can change the annual revenue. You can change the MKR price. We may want to have an alpha for annual revenues as expenses. Half of the expenses are used to give MKR tokens to people. It gives me good numbers to make some tests and see that all the collaterals are okay. We want the surplus buffer as the MKR outstanding target leverage ratio for understanding the target. The forecast of DAI for my scenario will be outstanding at the end of the year, which can also be changed. We can forecast that we want to have five billion at the end of the year in the budget. Still, the scenario of what we have in the budget is not a good element. What happens if DAI at the end of the period is not 5 billion but 10 billion? What if the price of the MKR token is not two thousand but four thousand? You can change the price of gas. I took all the sub proposals for core units. I took the budget in DAI, and removed the MKR one. For oracles, I put a random number in it. You also have a column on gas; I made those numbers up. Then you have the MKR that you want to allocate to people. The actual number is not important. If you want to spread the MKR token by the base expense, you can do it. You can change the MKR weight by whatever you want. It will automatically recompute the MKR that will be allocated to each core unit. Obviously, it also depends on this parameter. If you say that you don\u2019t allocate 25 million but instead allocate 12 million, you allocated fewer MKR tokens to people. By manipulating this column and this cell here, you can get whatever you want in the MKR token. Hence, you have the percentage of the budget used for each core unit. The most interesting part is that you have the MakerDAO P/L statement. Revenues and expenses are defined here. In this case, it\u2019s 34 million, and you get the net income as a combination of budget income and actual income. With the remaining net income, you will fill the surplus buffer. You try to achieve the target position, which is more or less the DAI at the end of the period multiplied by the target leverage ratio. You may want to lower the percentage for the DAI surplus buffer, and then you will get a different perspective. If there is still some income, it should be used to buy and burn MKR tokens. We start with almost 1 million MKR tokens. You issue some MKR tokens to the workforce, and you will buyback and burn some of them depending on other parameters. Then you get the end position for MKR tokens. I tried to get something that you can tune as much as you want and give you a perspective of what will happen. I know many people are concerned about having more than 1 million DAI. You can use a different scenario if you are above or below 1 million DAI. Are there any questions?  LongForWisdom: A few people saying that it seems very cool and useful. Somebody: Seb, did you share that link in the chat? Juan: You can find it in the forum.  LongForWisdom: Is there anything anyone would like to discuss before we end? I haven\u2019t heard from Lucas from Centrifuge. With the progress we\u2019re making on MIP22 and the Centrifuge assets, I hope they\u2019re feeling better with how things are going now. We\u2019ll leave it there.

My name is LongForWisdom. I am one of the Governance Facilitators at MakerDAO. Along with our usual updates, we will spend some time discussing delegation. There was a discussion about that last week which was cut short. Please feel free to interrupt, or ask questions, or make comments. We like to answer lots of questions and things.   Weekly Updates  Governance  LongForWisdom 01:03  The executive from two weeks ago has not yet passed. It needs 500 more MKR. With every likelihood, it will pass, either today or tomorrow. Then we\u2019ll be all clear for Friday\u2019s executive. If you haven\u2019t voted already, consider doing so. We also had only one poll this week, a parameter change proposal from the MakerDAO Open Market committee, proposing many rate cuts. That poll passed on-chain and will continue to the executive this week. This week\u2019s executive will have a couple of things; it will have the Core Unit budget payouts for July. It\u2019s going to have the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module activation for the PSM. We will put in the activation for the Flash Mint Module, DssVest, in there as well. That\u2019s a brief update on where governance is at for the DAO.   GovAlpha Core Unit update 02:48 GovAlpha Weekly Update  I have a very brief update on the GovAlpha. Our Core Unit had a fairly productive week. This is nice given that recent weeks weren\u2019t so good. One of the highlights is that we\u2019ve been adjusting the executive and polling processes to make them more decentralized. I am, to some extent taking credit for other people\u2019s work here. Big thanks to dUX and Derek from Protocol Engineering and Dimitri from Tech Ops for helping put this together. We\u2019re moving some of those processes away from the Foundation; they\u2019re mostly separate already. Still, the Foundation managed some lingering bits, but not much longer, which is awesome. We are moving forward towards delegation, which is awesome.- We also put together some initial templates for delegation. Prospective delegates can now have position statements. We\u2019ll make them public altogether so we can generate some discussion. We\u2019ll potentially start a \u201cMeet your Delegate\u201d type meeting, either next week or the week after. The final update from GovAlpha is that a new version of the MIPs portal has been pushed to production. This is mostly thanks to Pablo from GovAlpha and D-spots, working on the front-end on the actual site. The update should bring a more polished UI, layouts upgrades, bug fixes, and improved server infrastructure. Looking forward to seeing that go live.   Forum at a Glance  Elihu 05:16 Forum at a Glance  Three-Point Summary  A record 5.4 billion DAI is in circulation. System Surplus Buffer is at 47.3MM DAI. Total Value Locked in Maker is $9.5B.   Announcements  The Open Market Committee has published a new Parameter Changes Proposal  We have 2 AMA calls coming up:   Proposing The Maker Portfolio Core Unit with Chris Cameron on July 2nd.  Collateral Engineering with Robert Jordan on July 9th.     Discussions   Alternative MKR Compensation Guidelines   @Aes is looking for feedback on a new set of MKR vesting guidelines as he publishes his MKR Compensation Financial Model.    [Informal Poll] Which Public Calls Would You Like to Have Posted Summaries or Snippets?  With the number of public calls and community meetings constantly growing, @Artem_Gordon asks the community which calls should be summarized in a written form.    Maker Trilemma - PEG, Decentralization, DAI 1:1 collateral backing - USDC Discussion   @MakerMan describes the interplay between trying to keep the peg, fostering decentralization, and keeping a 1:1 DAI collateral backing.    Mapping out policy challenges and opportunities for Maker  With FATF\u2019s recommendations around the corner, @jacek starts a discussion concerning Maker\u2019s policy towards regulations.     Signal Requests   Shorten the PPG process   @alexis is looking to shorten the timeframe when a proposal by the Parameter Proposal Group is put up for vote.    Should we delay the governance poll related to adding PAX-GUSD-BUSD to PSM?   @MarianoDP is looking to delay the governance process on adding PAX-GUSD-BUSD until the community gains a better understanding of the implications.    Adjusting ttl(bid-duration) on flap-auctions   @ultraschuppi is seeking consensus on lowering the ttl parameter for flap auctions.    High Leverage G-UNI Vault to Replace PSM-USDC Exposure   @hexonaut makes an argument to fast-track the G-UNI collateral.    Increase Debt Ceiling of RWA-02 (NS-DROP) from 5M to 20M   @prankstr25 from New Silver seeks to increase the Debt Ceiling for NS-DROP from 5MM to 20MM.  LongForWisdom: I guess I should say that Peyton is now officially a Governance Facilitator, which is awesome. Many congratulations to Peyton. He will be running a few of these meetings in the next few weeks.       Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 08:10  The Optimism DAI bridge was in the final review. We completed that for test deployments, and we\u2019re waiting for the official launch date from Optimism. However, I believe that sometime today, they are going to take our deployer address and whitelist it so that we could deploy. In any case, we\u2019ve got a loose date to deploy that bridge on Optimism tomorrow. We still don\u2019t know what their launch date is, however. The D3M is complete, but it\u2019s not an immediate priority; it still requires a little bit of review. The SushiJoin adapter is complete as well, but we\u2019re waiting on the Sushi team. Sam had said it might be roughly another three weeks before they pick up to where they thought they were going to be. Tal did a technical evaluation on stETH, and the spell just passed. It looks like we\u2019re going to get Flashmint. For testing, we did the final Echidna and audit testing for the L2 escrow. We\u2019ve started using Cortera; They have a whole toolset for formal verification. We\u2019re starting to use that tool for verification. We have the ESM post mortem for discussions and documentation, which will probably be published later this week. Then there\u2019s also on the tail end that we discussed a MegaPoker post mortem which is not a system-wide post mortem; it\u2019s just that the MegaPoker wasn\u2019t poking a particular collateral type for a while, and we discussed that we may or may not end up publishing that. We\u2019ll have to see. We defined the expected ranges for many system variables\u2014all of the expected magnitude ranges and quantities. Everyone interested in that should review it. Thanks to Kurt for putting that together. We also discussed the Oracle tail risk mitigations, which may involve liquidations 2.1 or exactly how we deal with liquidations 2.1. Again this isn\u2019t necessarily in Oracles; it\u2019s more once we\u2019re past all of the Oracles, what do we do if we ingest a bad price? What do we want the system to do? That\u2019s all I had on my list.   Questions  Brianmcmichael: I should mention we\u2019ve looked into this Gelato token. Sam had a forum post trying to expedite it. Once it\u2019s live and audited and everything like that, we can move quickly.  Chris: Speaking of Gelato, their team may have also put their hat in the ring to work on the sort of DssCron which we cycle back to that MegaPoker post mortem. There are many little edge keepers that the Foundation used to run. There\u2019s a nice way that the protocol could incentivize the running of those keepers through DssCron or something to that effect. I think Gelato might take a stab at trying to implement it.   LongForWisdom: Greg asked in the chat if there\u2019s a place to see the roadmap for what Protocol Engineering is doing?  Derek: We\u2019re using Github. We have a kanban board, but there are many things in there that are either working with partners or other third parties that we wouldn\u2019t want to make public just yet. My original plan was to have that board fully public so that everyone could see it day-to-day, but we\u2019re not quite there yet. There was a good question that PlanetX raised today; It was \u201cwhat\u2019s an innovation pipeline and could that be something that we share, and there are thoughts around that?\u201d. I think that would be something I want to take a stab at and present a broader, longer-term view of the things that are on the table. I want to get the day-to-day stuff to a point where we can do that as well, but I\u2019m not quite there yet, Greg. Is there anything in particular in terms of collateral onboarding, specific items, or anything else that you\u2019d want to see more visibility on? Greg DiPrisco: No, I was just generally curious. Not that I don\u2019t like the surprise bombs in the forum. Derek: That\u2019s a good question, Greg. I\u2019ll try to consider how I can make those week-to-week things that we work on a little more visible. We have planned meetings on a Monday, which gives a good overview of what the team is focusing on for the next couple of days, who will be writing a spell on Thursday/Friday, who\u2019s reviewing it, and some of the processes around the team. Let me give that some thought to what I can make more visible; ideally, I\u2019d like to take the kanban board as it exists and extrapolate that automatically so we don\u2019t have multiple sources of truth. Let me give that some thought, and I\u2019ll see what we can do. BrianMcmichael: We do have a backlog of Governance-approved technical MIPs that we\u2019re working on. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve got a good priority list of that. We\u2019ve been working with GovAlpha to publish something like that, but we also need to remain dynamic when things pop up. If spontaneous opportunities occur, we need to be able to pivot to those too.     Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 16:15  We have been mostly working on the back-end. We are happy that the Oracle Core Unit polling vote passed; Thank you. But now is crunch time to get all the legal entity stuff set up and the contributor legal mumbo jumbo out of the way. That\u2019s been keeping us pretty busy. Marc-Andr\u00e9 has been heading up the new pricing tooling called Gopher that I mentioned on last week\u2019s call on the tech front. The way it\u2019s structured is that there\u2019s a phased rollout. Because this is completely new tech, we wanted to be very careful if we saw some errors in production that wouldn\u2019t take the whole Oracle network down with it. We had a minority of stakeholders upgrading, and it\u2019s been running incredibly smoothly. We\u2019ve seen many price updates for the Oracle update; it\u2019s already taking into account these new price updates from the new tooling. We\u2019re in a comfortable spot to do the remainder of the migration now, which is ongoing. We have the Spire upgrade in the pipeline, which is this alternative peer-to-peer networking type of layer. That\u2019s going to be coming out shortly as well within the next couple of weeks. We\u2019ve been testing that internally for quite some time now, and that\u2019s meant to be not an alternative to Scuttlebutt but more of a substitute. The two will be running in parallel. If there are ever any issues with one of them, the Oracle feeds will jump to the other. We should be finishing up both of those migrations within the next month or so. I wouldn\u2019t call it version 3.0, but it\u2019s version 2.5 because it\u2019s much more resilient.   Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 19:21  Once we have the Vault deployed and Oracles tested, we\u2019ll likely propose to increase DC to a higher value, potentially up to 50 million and more. We just published two collateral evaluations recently, one for stETH and another one for Polygon. For stETH, we proposed a bit lower DC of 5 million Dai because Oracle suggested that we start with a lower exposure because Oracle implementation is not that straightforward. But then again, it depends on community appetite towards this asset, which, of course, has certain counterparty risks. We also proposed a higher liquidation ratio of 160% because we believe this Vault might have high demand. If we increase the DC, we\u2019ll probably have more capacity to increase the ceiling if we have a higher liquidation ratio. There are also still some liquidity concerns around stETH. Most liquidity is incentivized by Curve pools, which was another reason we proposed a bit higher liquidation ratio than ETH-A, which has a similar market risk profile. Another evaluation was posted today for Polygon, previously known as Matic. Our new team member, Sean, helped us make this evaluation. It\u2019s really good to see the team growing, and happy to have Sean on our team. The proposed parameters are pretty standard, similar to what we have for other similar market profile volatile tokens. Hopefully, we see some demand. The token is on-chain liquid, and we can afford to increase DC, which was currently proposed to be 10 million Dai. There\u2019s ongoing work on D3M. We\u2019ll probably have the valuation finished next week. We\u2019re spending a bit more time assessing the credit risk and liquidity risk of the Dai market on Aave V2. An interesting finding so far was that Dai\u2019s credit risk is much smaller than we thought. A few numbers might be interesting for the community to hear from the competitive standpoint; Aave V2 Dai borrow amounts, so the aggregate amount is about 1.2 billion. However, when you look at what kind of positions these are, these borrows are mostly recursive stablecoin leverage positions that people make to maximize liquidity mining rewards. The actual organic Dai borrow amounts are very small. When we say organic stablecoin borrow, that\u2019s stablecoin borrowing collateralized by volatile assets and not by stable coins. This number is much smaller, amounts to only 150 million Dai. That is this only 13% of this Dai debt that we observe for now is actually organic and potentially unsafe in market drop events. That\u2019s positive news from a risk perspective for D3M. Still, it also tells us that competitors are much smaller in organic usage. This was something really interesting. There\u2019s still ongoing discussion on Institutional Vaults. I think we\u2019re now calling them Conditional Vaults. Growth, we and Protocol Engineering are looking at making this offering available fastest by simply using the current Vault parameters we have, not making a whole MIP process, which might take too long. We are also preparing some simulations to test for lower liquidation ratios for all the Vaults because there were some ideas and questions on how potentially lower liquidation ratios would affect the risk profile at Maker if we wanted to boost Dai supply in such away. There\u2019s also continuous work on our dashboards. Once we finish D3M, we\u2019ll focus more on analyzing our users, meaning we\u2019ll try to get more stats about their behavior and see how exactly all this Dai that\u2019s being minted is utilized. Lastly, the Protocol Engineering team asked us to look at DefCon Spells. Some are a bit outdated. These are the spells of advanced prepared spells or parameter adjustments if we hit a major price drop or a system malfunction.   Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 25:24 Real-World Finance Core Unit Report - 2021-06  For NewSilver, there is a new signal request proposing to increase the DC to 20 million Dai. Currently, it\u2019s set to 5 million Dai using 16 percent of the Vault. They have implemented all the changes that were needed in the last post mortem. They published all the documents on the forum, which are the agreement with the independent director, the new notification system. There was an improvement in the smart contract for NewSilver after the audit from ABDK with a new system with a link with MakerDAO. For the Centrifuge collaterals that were approved by the Governance last month. They were delayed due to the change in the improvement on the smart contract side. They are pushing on Kovan next week. It would mean that it would be deployed on the mainnet for those new pools within the next two weeks. On the SolarX front, it got a bit delayed because there was some discussion/negotiation on the risk profile the Maker community would like to have initially. It\u2019s a construction project, we start to land at the beginning due to tax issues and some other problems that we can discuss, but that means that at the beginning, they wanted to have a release of cash before they even bought the land. Then we would have no collateral, or at least just some research, but research is quite cheap these days, and I don\u2019t know how to sell research. The idea is to restructure the project by adding the land to the project\u2019s equity. From the start, we will have access to the equity of the land if there was any problem in this phase. That would be safer from our side would be more likely to be approved by the community and Governance. That\u2019s why we suggest they take some extra time to find a better solution to propose to the community. We are still making some progress on the Cayman financial and all the tax issues. We have a call on the tax issues in 30 minutes. On the 6S front, Matt is not here, but maybe Greg can brief us if there are some updates.  Greg DiPrisco: Things are moving slowly, but they are moving. We\u2019re still waiting for the tax ID from the IRS. It\u2019s this very strange issue where trust cannot get a digital tax ID. We need to do it via the mail, and the IRS is very backed up right now. We\u2019re just waiting on them. The other issue is the transfer instructions from Genesis, which are going back and forth between the lawyers, and it seems like they\u2019ll be done in the next few days. After we get the transfer instructions and the tax ID, we should be able to close, and at that point, RWA will put up any final risk disclosures that it sees with the structure. Hopefully, Matt will petition for an executive vote to raise this DC.   On the Real World Finance side, we\u2019ve published two posts. One with LongForWisdom for the new MKR guidelines, and another one that is more on the finance front to model the impact of giving MKR rewards to the Core Units and see the impacts on the profits and losses balance sheet, and so forth. You can play with the spreadsheet to model what you think Maker will become due to the MKR compensation. On the data front, we\u2019ve made some progress there. As you know, we are using Dune Analytics a lot to publish the monthly reports and use some Google spreadsheets for the Real World Asset stuff. It\u2019s quite painful. We have started to work to have a real database where every data on-chain and off-chain is dumped into. We can use some SQL queries to make some more elaborated models and then use any front-end to access the data. That means that, for instance, I don\u2019t have the financial updated today because it will take more than one day for it to be updated. Still, when it is automated, we will have the data every day. There is a Github for that. It\u2019s open-source. It\u2019s not a perfect production. The idea is to have something quite simple that we can improve and iterate on. It\u2019s not going to be a separate product. We are not recreating Dune Analytics or any other system. Just something that should be fast and easy to use.   Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 32:00 Growth CU Weekly Updates  Many updates this week. We have been talking with different companies that require Maker to pass through the KYC process for one reason or another. One of these companies is, of course, Circle. Since last week, we talked with them about this idea that someone suggested in the forum about investing in the USDC we have in the Circle yield account. It was a great discussion. I read all your comments and the questions you have, and I asked Circle all these questions. They require an entity as a counterparty to sign the agreement to access these Circle yield accounts. One interesting thing is that it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s an individual, a trust, or a bank. Still, it has to be an accredited investor. The KYC process is not just for the company. We also have to understand who are the controlling partners of this company. It\u2019s also good to know that Circle converses with other DAOs with a foundation or a central entity that controls the treasury. For these other DAOs, it\u2019s easier to decide to sign an agreement with Circle and start using these yield accounts. I think this is also what Compound is offering now. I guess that Compound is using Circle\u2019s yield account. For them, it\u2019s easier than for us because we are in this process of complete decentralization, which is more difficult. We also spoke with Galaxy. Big fan of Maker. They like the idea of using Maker vaults, but then again, they brought up the problem about KYC. They have to KYC us, and we don\u2019t have any entity. Maker protocol is not an entity, so they wouldn\u2019t be able to use Maker Vaults. After seeing all these opportunities that we have right now, we decided to ask our legal advisor to work on this and have his point of view. He will explain the risks and options we have as MakerDao, to understand the next step. Paper Emporium is working on a proposal to start investing the Maker protocol assets into TradeFi. I think we can work together and find out what are the options we have for this. Thanks to everyone for supporting the PSM delay. We are talking with Paxos and Binance. We have to talk with Gemini. It is interesting, and I think we have to know that including the stable coins in the PSM is a negotiation tool for us. It\u2019s something others want. In the case of Binance, they are super excited about being included in the PSM. They want to showcase Dai as one of the top 10 use cases for USD with Dai. They also want to engage their community about using these BUSD-Dai integrations. This is great, and I think my team thinks we can ask them for more things in return for this proposal, including them in the PSM. I think it\u2019s good to know what other projects could give the Maker protocol a return for being added to the PSM. We will also be working with all the projects that we will offboard. We plan to talk with these projects ask them why they are not using the Vault. It\u2019s good to understand why other project\u2019s treasuries, foundations, or DAOs are not using Maker Vaults to get liquidity. As a fun fact, we discovered that the Decentraland is paying salaries in Dai, so we don\u2019t understand why they are not using the Maker Vaults. We want to talk with them, explain to them the situation, and ask them if they want, of course, and try to convince them to open a Vault and use the remaining DC that they have available. We will give them 30 days to do that. I think that that\u2019s also something that we could use as input to decide to offboard them in the future. Star of the Week is BlockFi. People who can open an account in BlockFi will be giving an 8.5% yield in Dai. This is very cool and is also a reminder that it will be great to have the DSR alive. I don\u2019t know if you have seen it. Still, Coinbase is also launching this yield with USDC, of course, powered by Circle. We have seen many fintech and neobanks very interested in USDC because they will have access to these extra yields. This is something to consider when we discuss the future of DSR. Last week, we launched our Twitter account. This is the tweet of the week:   image864\u00d7750 83.4 KB   Questions  Christopher Mooney: Nadia, the deal with Matic is them monetizing our treasury. I wonder if this effectively the same thing that we did with YFI or that YFI wanted to do? And anyone can answer this, is there any major difference between the two situations because I know MKR holders didn\u2019t vote for YFI to do this. I\u2019m just wondering if that appetite has changed? If Should they resubmit? What the story is.  LongForWisdom: It\u2019s maybe worth mentioning that YFI is doing it in YFI. They just kind of want it to be with more favorable rates, I think. Nadia: I think it\u2019s also the DC. I think that the problem was that the DC YFI wanted to have, but I\u2019m totally in favor of YFI\u2019s proposal. I think that we should consider being the bank for DeFi treasuries. I know that has its risks associated, but if they don\u2019t have Maker, they will look for other options. I\u2019m seeing UMA operating to be the bank to these DeFi treasuries. I mean, there\u2019s a clear opportunity. We have to decide if we want to take it or others will take it for us.   Nadia: By the way, Jen is also working with Gnosis because Maker Vaults were not integrated into Gnosis, and everyone is using their multi-sig. Every DAO uses its multi-sig, so now it will be easier for DAOs to open up Vaults if they use a multi-sig that everyone uses. That\u2019s also good news to position ourselves as the bank of the DAOs. Christopher Mooney: Who\u2019s working with Gnosis? Did you say?  Nadia: Jennifer from my team. Christopher Mooney: Great.   Nadia: I want to add that MATIC is different because they were as collateral in the protocol, and they want to be onboarded. They are telling Maker holders that if MATIC is included, they will use the Vault. I think it\u2019s good to know that if we are going to pass through all the effort of including new collateral in the protocol, it\u2019s good to know that someone will use it.

Any documentation that will help any stranger to set up their Core Unit. Sandbox is to design and improve architecture for the Maker protocol that enables mainly parallel smart contract development. X-Ray is about the talent onboarding funnel, recruiting, and anything that will improve this as a DAO.

We were able to observe differences between the previous and new cycles. We didn\u2019t have anything fail, which is great. The 10k MKR minimum default vote amount was a ballpark number, which we were able to meet. However, we did witness some proposals hang below that 10k threshold until much later in their voting period. This makes some sense because many people vote toward the end. We don\u2019t believe this is a problem yet. Still, as we continue, we will analyze if we can get any issues concerning the new Governance cycle. Overall, it has made things easier; we had healthy participation along with other things.  Christopher Mooney: I love that we don\u2019t have to make a whole spell on a Monday and jeopardize the hat.  LongForWisdom: That is great. The old cycle did have the benefit of giving the chance to implement things through that same month\u2019s Executive vote. We have to wait to commission the DssVest since we could not do that with the new Governance cycle since the final monthly vote doesn\u2019t occur in the Executive.     EthCC Event  Nadia Alvarez  Regarding what Juan said, we are planning an event between all the Core Units and different community members. This event will in Paris be during the EthCC on the 21st. We are currently defining the venue. We want to have a panel where various Core Units will speak about what they are doing. We also would like someone from the Community available to speak. If you are interested, please, reach out to us!  LongForWisdom: There are a few Core Units and people coming to that. Please get in touch and participate.     Presentations and Other Discussions  Discussion on Delegation  LongForWisdom 57:46  We spoke a bit of delegation last week. There was a spirited discussion that took place near the end of the meeting. If anybody wants to discuss anything specific about delegation, now is a good time. The main discussion point last week was on whether mandated actors should be delegates. If anybody has strong feelings about that in any direction, please feel free to opt-in. I\u2019ll kind of state my position as it is, and people can argue. I think I\u2019m balanced. My current position is that I like the fact that there\u2019s almost a separation of powers between mandated actors versus Maker holders. It\u2019s not a clean separation because there were overlaps. If delegates are still not the mandated actors, then I will continue. There\u2019ll be a kind of a give and take between the delegates of the mandated actors, which should hopefully keep both sides somewhat in check. By allowing those two parts to kind of combine in one entity, you lose that give and take a little bit anyway, which I don\u2019t think will be ideal. That\u2019s one point. On the other hand, it\u2019s very difficult to stop anyone from being a delegate because it\u2019s entirely permissionless. Given that nothing is stopping a Core Unit or a mandated actor from becoming a delegate on this line, it\u2019s probably better that they do it publicly if they do it at all. This suggests implementing a sort of draconian policy of saying that if a mandated actor is caught being a delegate, you dismiss them as a mandated actor, which is possible. I think it\u2019s a bit heavy-handed. It\u2019s unlikely to work well in practice, especially since you need to make a vote to sort of offboarding someone. As I said, the mandated actor will be a delegate, so it will have like a weight in that place that will get a bit complicated. I\u2019m curious if anyone has strong feelings on either side of this issue.  Planet_X: I\u2019m divided on this. In some ways, it would be a great advantage to have them as delegates because if there is a discussion, you could get answers straight away, and that would be a huge plus. On the other hand, part of the scope of the delegators, it\u2019s going to be more or less a little bit of a boardroom. The performance of mandated actors and the Core Units will be an essential task of the delegators. With regards to that, it\u2019s better if they\u2019re not delegators. Anyone else who has an opinion? Derek: Ideally, facilitators like myself shouldn\u2019t be mandated actors because we already have quite a lot of centralized control in the team itself. Protocol Engineering is working on the protocol. We shouldn\u2019t be voting on things that we\u2019re putting forward. I think there needs to be a broader discussion with the broader community. Of course, many people are anonymous, so you can\u2019t be strict about that. Still, I think having a broader discussion group, like with yourself, Planet X, that is not part of a Core Unit is a healthy dynamic to have. I welcome that discourse and discussion from others who are not part of core teams and will inevitably have counter views to what the different teams will have. So yeah, I\u2019m leaning towards facilitators not being delegates even though you can\u2019t enforce that strictly. Nkunkel: I think the enforcement angle here is a little bit irrelevant. There\u2019s much stuff, and even just like regular governments, that\u2019s done on a gentleman\u2019s agreement type of basis. Let\u2019s collectively, as a community, agree that, okay, this shouldn\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see many people cross that line. LongForWisdom: Yeah. It\u2019s tricky. I consider as well if you have a situation where some of the mandated actors want to delegate, that\u2019s fine, and others very much don\u2019t. You end up with a situation like voting power leading towards different domains, which I think could be problematic. It would be less bad if all Core Unit facilitators had some light weights because they could balance each other. Still, I\u2019m worried if it\u2019s all congregates on certain Core Units. Nkunkel: Let\u2019s say, for instance, that in terms of crypto Twitter, or popular culture, one Core Unit is very popular. Let\u2019s use PE as an example. Let\u2019s glorify the devs who are building the core of the protocol, and everyone delegates to the PE team. Now you have the situation that Mooney posted, where he\u2019s taking on the liability of both writings the bug and then voting it into the protocol. That\u2019s a little more funny way to look at it. The way I see it is that you devolve into the kind of situation that Bitcoin finds itself in, where the devs have taken over control of the protocol, where they can kill something if they don\u2019t like it, or they can get something in if they do. That worries me. I don\u2019t want us to be in that type of situation. Devs should write the code, but they shouldn\u2019t influence whether it makes it into the protocol or not. LongForWisdom: Yeah. I think that\u2019s a fair point of view, avoiding any potentially problematic tribal comments at the stage. I\u2019m curious if anyone is taking the opposite view because I know Walter did last week. Does anyone else hold the same view that mandated actors should be delegates? We\u2019ve heard quite a lot from one side.   Juan: I like Nik\u2019s point of view, but at the same time, I don\u2019t want to build or impose any rules, even if we can enforce them. I feel that MKR holders will delegate to whomever they want, and it\u2019s better to do it in a quote-unquote legal way. Allow for it, if needed, and all the conflict of interest being declared compared to some random wallets showing up, and it\u2019s like, oh, who\u2019s this? Okay. They got a bunch of delegation. We don\u2019t know who it is. It might be a mandated actor; maybe it\u2019s not. And not being able to interact with that person, I think it might have worse ramifications, but I share many of the points that Nik raised. I\u2019m on the fence about this one.  LongForWisdom: I think if we did conclude that we didn\u2019t think mandated actors being delegates was a good idea, as part of GovAlpha\u2019s responsibilities, I\u2019m planning to write a what should you consider as an MKR holder when you delegate. This will be one of the recommendations that we put in there. We don\u2019t think mandated actors make the most sense as this kind of targets delegation to delegate for the reasons we\u2019ve discussed. I wasn\u2019t stopping anyone from doing it. Still, it sort of at least allows people to consider the potential issues before they do.   Nadia: If we know the facilitators or Core Units shouldn\u2019t be delegators, why don\u2019t we create a rule? I understand we can\u2019t enforce it, but we could ask Maker holders and explain why we think it\u2019s not a good idea, ask them if they think the same or not, and create rules about who could be delegators. I understand that we all agree now that we don\u2019t want that to happen, but it could happen in the future if it\u2019s not a rule. So why don\u2019t we create a clear framework for everyone? If you want to be a delegator and part of a Core Unit, you can always quit your Core Unit and become a delegator? If we have clear rules for everyone, I think it\u2019s much better than assume that we all agree in a social agreement that we shouldn\u2019t have facilitators or core units as delegators.  LongForWisdom: I think that\u2019s a fair point. Any rule that we make can be unmade. It\u2019s very much the social layer that is enforcing or enforce it. Suppose the social layer develops into a group that feels that mandated actors should be delegates. In that case, they\u2019re just going to unmake the rule that says that the mandated actors can\u2019t be delegates because they\u2019ll have. In theory, the social layer is the MKR holders at this stage. If that social consensus changes, then the rules will be changed. There\u2019s no way it could be where we can make a rule that sort of binds the future community and the future MKR holders to our current recommendations. Maybe it would be good if we could do that.   Nadia: I think Brian mentioned that it has to do with the delegators; If the MKR holders see that a delegate might be getting too much power, they might want to remove that or switch it to another delegate.- Juan: Nadia said we all agree that they should not, and I don\u2019t agree with that statement. I don\u2019t think they should, but I also don\u2019t think they should not. I\u2019m neutral on that one. I agree that a concentration of power is dangerous at any point in the process, but this does not stop at this stage. I\u2019m talking about the whole ecosystem. Eventually, I think that it would level out.  LongForWisdom: Yeah. I think it\u2019s also important to note that the risks of power centralization exist without this, which is what people are saying in the sidebar. Nothing stops one delegate who isn\u2019t a mandated actor from getting a huge amount of MKR delegates to them to the point where they essentially control the vertical. And there\u2019s no way we can adjudicate that and say that can\u2019t happen. It\u2019s up to MKR holders. I think it\u2019s probably like I said, we can\u2019t enforce it, Nadia, unfortunately, as much as some of us may want to. Essentially, there\u2019s another wrinkle to this as well: a lot of the initial delegates or people who have contributed to Core Units in the past, at the very least. The other sort of negative result of this is if we say we don\u2019t want to want mandated actors or people with connections to Core Units to delegate, then we\u2019d potentially lose sort of several other people who have already expressed interest in being a delegate. Nkunkel: I don\u2019t see a problem if you were a past Core Unit facilitator or contributor that you\u2019re a delegate. It\u2019s only if the two overlap at the current point in time. If anything, it is probably very helpful to have a delegator who used to be a facilitator and is now on the other side. LongForWisdom: Yeah, I think it can be. No matter what you do, it enables the possibility for more corruption. An example of corruption in this sort of situation you just mentioned, Nik, in sort of traditional governments, you always hear like, oh, you know someone who was a minister then became like some executive of some multinational corporation that was lobbying for certain decisions in government, and potentially vice-versa. You could have the mandated actor who sorts of steps down with the express purpose of becoming a delegate and pushing the agenda that the next, probably their successor, will push. Nkunkel: I feel like there are much bigger and relevant problems to deal with that delegation can solve in the short term. This split between facilitators or Core Unit members and delegators solves those long-tail problems.- Nkunkel: I agree in principle, but if we\u2019re dealing with those types of problems, we\u2019ve already made it. If we\u2019ve made it there, we have a whole different set of problems to worry about. LongForWisdom: Yeah. I agree. I was trying to make the point that no system is going to be perfect. As I said, we\u2019ll post something that explains our point of view and our current recommendations to MKR holders when delegating, which will cover this. Suppose anybody wants to try and submit a MIP or write a MIP that tries to enforce certain rules for delegates. In that case, that\u2019s also something anyone can do.   Tim Schuppener: To clarify, is it about being a delegate or being a recognized delegate? Suppose somebody wants to be a delegate and he cannot because of some strange MIP law we put up at some random point in time. In that case, they will create a second account being unrecognized and tell their friends and become a delegate this way. I don\u2019t think we need to vary too much about the whole topic. I mean, right now, we have something like, I don\u2019t know, 7% to 10% of the shares being in active voting; how bad can it be in the future if we have delegation? It would just be better, and we\u2019ll sort it out naturally.  LongForWisdom: Yeah. I agree. I don\u2019t think this is a make-or-break problem. I don\u2019t think this is something that we need to get right initially. The reality is there is no way to enforce this, and if people are going to do it, then I would rather they do it publicly so people can keep track of them as well. Nkunkel: I still think we shouldn\u2019t let the enforceability of this dissuade us from just deciding as a community that we don\u2019t like this. I think the social signaling is more than strong enough as an enforcement mechanism, at least at first. If you\u2019re unknown, great, but you\u2019re going to have a hard time pulling in big bags of Maker because you can\u2019t use your identity as your brand to attract the MKR as a delegate. Tim Schuppener: No, but let\u2019s say one of the VCs is fond of Derek, and saying, Hey, Derek, it would be cool if you could be a delegate. And Derek would say, sorry, I cannot do. And then they bribe him, and he creates a second account unknown; nobody knows about it, just the VC. This works totally. So why are we trying to prevent this? Nkunkel: I agree. That\u2019s possible. Tim Schuppener: You\u2019re not getting bribed, Derek. I was making it up. Nkunkel: I agree that\u2019s possible, but I think the social layer consensus is a lot stronger than people give it credit for. Many things in government that we have our traditions and social consensus. They\u2019re not codified into law or anything. LongForWisdom: That\u2019s definitely true, and some of those traditions hold fairly strongly, but we\u2019ve also seen examples recently where those traditions have been broken with limited regard for anyone. I do think the social consensus is pretty strong. If someone wants to write a MIP that says these are the rules for delegates that everyone agrees on, we can do that. We can vote on it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s critical to start with. Tim Schuppener: If MKR holders don\u2019t like the idea of Core Unit facilitators being delegates, then they won\u2019t delegate to this person. There is no need to come up with some so-so consensus. How should this work? Is somebody going to write a MIP saying we don\u2019t like that, and then we have to submit it to the voting portal? Is that the way to go? Derek: All it will be is a social agreement. You can never have more than that. Tim Schuppener: Yeah, but I mean, code is the law. So if people don\u2019t like the social agreement, they will act otherwise because it\u2019s possible to do. And they will find the bribable Derek out there. Nkunkel: I think we\u2019re over\u2026 LongForWisdom: Scared of all the Dereks, it seems. Tim Schuppener: Just sticking to the story.   Nkunkel: The only way that works is if the person is anonymous because if they\u2019re a Core Unit facilitator or contributor or whatever. Then they\u2019re a public delegator; then the next step is for governance to vote that person out of their position. And then it becomes the code is law enforcement of the social values that we\u2019ve agreed on. We\u2019re just talking about this edge case of someone unknown and kind of darks themselves to certain people to get their MKR delegated to them. I think that that edge case is possible. Still, I don\u2019t think it invalidates the rest of the benefit that we get in all other cases, except for that specific edge case.  LongForWisdom: The potential flip side to that is that if you don\u2019t force people to do it unknown, then they\u2019ll do it publicly, and you can keep better track of what they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s the kind of counterargument. Suppose you do say it\u2019s why you don\u2019t recommend it, but we would rather it was public than private. In that case, potentially, it\u2019ll be public, and it\u2019s easier to track any conflicts of interests, any potential sketchiness, or whatever. Nkunkel: Yeah. The Yakuza model in Japan. How did that work out for them? LongForWisdom: I\u2019ll admit my Japanese history is not the best. Could you elaborate? Nkunkel: TLDR, it didn\u2019t.   LongForWisdom: Got you. Cool. All right. As I said, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to decide on something beforehand because we\u2019re hoping to launch fairly soon. If anyone is deeply concerned about it and thinks we should try and enforce it, it would be the way to go. I\u2019m happy to like help review any MIPs that anyone wants to write along those lines.

My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the governance facilitator at MakerDAO. I\u2019m joined by a host of Maker people. As usual, we\u2019ve got an agenda to get through. Some updates involve the regular folks. I\u2019ll briefly review the preamble. Feel free to interrupt at any point. We like to hear from all of you. Please don\u2019t be shy. Usually, we\u2019d have governance first. However, Nick is going to be tied up, so we\u2019re going, beginning with Oracles. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Update Oracle Team Update Nik Kunkel 00:58  I apologize for the ad hoc nature of the call. I\u2019m going through the airport right now. Nonetheless, we launched the Starkware update to the oracles. This is officially MakerDAO\u2019s first success in L2 oracles. It\u2019s a big deal, and I\u2019m thrilled that we get to partner with dYdX to do this. dYdX released their alpha mainnet release. In about a week or two, give or take, the public mainnet release will be out, which will be using Maker oracles. That\u2019s really cool. Brian and Chris will speak about this in a bit.  Introduction (continued) Agenda and Preamble (continued) LongForWisdom 02:25  We\u2019ve seen the weekly executive and polls, which had passed. The previous week\u2019s executive had onboarded UNI-V2-WBTC-DAI and UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH LP tokens for those pairs. We increased the DSR to 0.01%. We increased the ETH-A maximum DC from 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion. We increased the system surplus buffer to 30 million. In terms of polls this week:  We had a rates proposal to increase the ETH-A and ETH-B stability fees, which passed. We had onboarded the UNI-V2-DAI-USDT LP pair, which had also passed. We had a poll to lower the PSM-USDC-A toll out(tout) parameter, which is the amount you pay when you are taking USDC out of the PSM in exchange for DAI. We also voted to set an initial flash mint module fee. We still don\u2019t know precisely when the flash mint module will be implemented, but we do have a starting value for the fee. Finally, we had a poll for decreasing the stablecoin vault DC, which was the only poll that did not pass. This Friday\u2019s executive should include the rates proposal and onboard UNI-V2-DAI-USDT and lower the PSM-USDC-A toll. That covers the polls and executives this week.   In terms of governance domain work, we continue to various onboard contributors such as Prose, Eli, and Pablo. The MIPs portal we showed off last week is still in progress. We have been working on feedback points, proposals and cleaning up existing MIPs to make them more standardized. We\u2019ve also done work on MIP amendments to make the amendment side of MIPs a little bit easier, thanks to David. We have also worked on the usual MIPs, governance, and related stuff. There\u2019s a lot of MIPs that have been submitted for the next cycle. March is going to be busy for MIPs.  Weekly Updates Governance at a Glance Elihu 05:52 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread  Hello everyone, my name is Eli. I\u2019ll be going through Governance at a Glance this week. First up, as the price for ETH has dropped, about 10 million dollars were liquidated in Maker this Tuesday. In a turbulent market such as this, the DAI supply didn\u2019t move much. It\u2019s now sitting at 2.3 billion. DAI volume-weighted average price has been constant at 1.001. As far as announcements go, Juan is starting a core unit launch podcast series to inform Maker users on specific core unit\u2019s proposals, budgets, and executions. You can listen to it during this Wednesday\u2019s growth core unit launch pod session.  Discussions   Core Units I wish existed  Iammeeoh introduces the idea of a Hiring and Careers Core Unit, and Juan highlights a potential Legal Core Unit\u2019s tasks.    Why deploy on xdai?  The discussion is going strong, with several contributors analyzing the pros and cons of a xDAI-based solution.    EuroDAI  Creating a version of DAI pegged to the European Union\u2019s currency? Head here to discuss.    Signal Requests   Increase PSM-DC and set Debt Ceiling for USDC-A/B to 0   New ultraschuppi advocates to:  set the DC for USDC-A and USDC-B to 0 stop the lerp to 500M and instead set a new debt ceiling for PSM-USDC      Adjusting Dust Parameter  New Given the consequences of high gas prices in a declining market, monet-supply proposes raising the dust parameter.    Adjust ETH-A DC-IAM-line  New ultraschuppi proposes raising the line for ETH-A from the current 2.5B with voting options up to 15B.   LongForWisdom: Thank you, Eli. There are a few other signal requests that are ongoing from the previous week as well. I\u2019m going to leave those open for this meeting, and I\u2019ll close them towards the end of the meeting. If you haven\u2019t voted, please have a look.  Smart Contracts Team Brian McMichael 08:21  Chris realized 15 minutes ago that we had a kickoff call with trailofbits overlapping this meeting. We just got off a call where we deployed MIP21 to Kovan. Therefore, I\u2019m not entirely prepared right now, but I\u2019ll go through it live. The interim reports for Liquidations 2.0 have been received from PWC and Quantstamp. We are working on responses. As you have noticed, we\u2019ve just begun the interaction with trailofbits as well. This week, we\u2019re planning on adding DAI-USDT LP tokens to the mainnet. Those contracts for the flips and joins were deployed this morning. Sam is working on the spell this week. We\u2019ve agreed with Centrifuge to begin slotting a couple of hours a week working on MIP22 considerations, which should initiate after we get MIP21 to mainnet. Also, MIP45 has been updated and formally submitted this week. We\u2019ve also heavily worked on MIP21, and as I mentioned, we just got it deployed this morning. That\u2019s a significant milestone for us. On the people front, we are in the process of interviewing candidates. It\u2019s a touchy subject because of the transition. In regards to that, I would like to announce that Kurt has rejoined the Foundation team. We are very excited to have him back. This should help our bandwidth quite a bit. Kurt: Yeah, thanks. I told Long that I prepared a speech; it\u2019s short. Nonetheless, hello, I\u2019m back. It\u2019s good to be back. I\u2019m looking forward to Daoing it up in here. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the speech. Thank you all very much.  Risk Team Primoz Kordez 11:05  In terms of collateral evaluations, last week, we posted the previous UNI LP evaluation, the DAI USDT UNI LP. We also proposed parameters for ETH-C vault type. It should go into an on-chain poll next week. The proposed parameters for ETH-C are a 3.5% stability fee, 175% liquidation ratio, and 1 billion DC with a gap parameter of 100 million. This vault, if the executive vote passes, should be available in approximately ten days. We can expect some refinancing from ETH-A to ETH-C. Hopefully, we can lower risk exposure to ETH by increasing the overall ETH collateralization ratio, one of the main goals. Mark has been finishing research on renBTC, which should be posted soon. Based on findings, we believe we should postpone onboarding of a lower liquidation ratio renBTC-B vault. The liquidity metrics and redemption risks are not very promising. We already see that auctions with lower liquidation ratio vaults such as ETH-B are not encouraging. We should postpone onboarding lower liquidation ratio renBTC until liquidations 2.0 is implemented. Monet-supply made a signal yesterday inquiring about a higher dust limit. Everyone is aware of the recent gas prices and what this means for Maker retail users, and how it negatively affects liquidations. We could make certain variations of dust limits based on the vault\u2019s liquidation ratio. Monet-supply proposed that we could afford slightly lower dust on ETH-C than ETH because auction efficiency is usually higher with higher collateralized vaults. Please take a look at this signal and vote for the current dust limit. I also want to urge people to reconsider voting on PSM USDC. This DC should be higher than 500 million. A one billion debt ceiling would be better, especially if we\u2019re going to set stablecoin vault DCs to zero. Let\u2019s suppose we migrate USDC stablecoin vaults to PSM. In that case, we would be at over 500 debt utilization. We want to have at least twenty percent of DAI supply available in PSM to have quick mint availability in times of a DAI liquidity squeeze. In terms of risks, the 500 DC is way over the limits if anything goes wrong with USDC. Finally, I made another post today regarding changes in some flip auctions parameters, particularly the collateral auctions. These changes are based on findings of keepers capital from Tuesday\u2019s auctions. To sum it up, we proposed a lower auction and bid duration from 6 hours to 4 hours\u2014a slightly higher box from 15 million to 20 million. We also proposed a higher back value for UNI LPs and ETH-B vaults because auctions didn\u2019t clear up successfully. That keeper participation is a bit lower.  Real World Finance S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 16:08  There has been progress within the accounting part of real-world finance. I have updated the P&L of MakerDAO. It is now a complete financial statement, including assets and liabilities. This will be useful when I reiterate the balance sheet management, which is the extension of the strategic reserves. More on this will be coming soon. I\u2019m working to move from Gene Analytics to another third party because the spreadsheet\u2019s SQL query is becoming very large. It\u2019s about five hundred lines of code, and it\u2019s not one hundred percent correct. There is still some work to be done. We had good progress on many collaterals. Things are moving well, especially on SolarX. There is a MIP6 in the forum, which is interesting for two reasons:  It\u2019s a big-sized asset. They are looking for 100 million dollars to invest in solar farms in the New York state. They are using the trust model from 6S. It\u2019s the second collateral that is following this system and would be quite interesting to see.   The MIP6 is correct. However, the team is working with SolarX to make it more proper. Stay tuned for this. If you have any questions, please ask.  LongForWisdom: It would be cool if we can help in renewable energy generation.    Operational Support Amy Jung 18:20  I posted the weekly updates to allow everyone to follow along and use the links. We\u2019ve been primarily working on helping core units within their early development from the idea stage up to get it running. We did the Dss.Gov incentives in Know Your MIP, which Juan hosted, and Peyton generously presented. There\u2019s a lot of excellent discussions there. I would recommend looking at the recording. This is not going to move into formal submission this month. For collateral onboarding, we had Kane and Kevin present from Synthetix regarding SNX and SUSD, which are separate proposals but are grouped into one. Still, there was a lot of interesting discussion around liquidation oracles and how it might all work. Next week there will not be a collateral onboarding call. There\u2019s no project lined up, but we will be repurposing the time to do the core unit launch pod session with the growth core unit. Next Wednesday will involve that session. Regarding updates on the core units, we have the resource board where you can keep track of drafts. Standout feedback that we\u2019ve heard is it being difficult to know who\u2019s drafting and what stage things are at. We\u2019re doing our best to keep these updated. We\u2019re collecting resources there\u2014stuff like accountable or Opolis, which brings me to the second point.  Opolis presented in the community call this Tuesday, which includes a presentation and set of slides. Go ahead and check it out. They\u2019re not ready for international yet. However, I would suggest checking that out. Check out the core unit I Wish Existed if you are lingering on what to do, where to begin, or if others may need help. The launch pod sessions will explore the idea of digging deeper into some core units. It may involve some topics such as what their core unit will be structured and its purpose. We had three that moved into formal submission, which governance will do their cycle on. Essentially, the core unit framework itself is going into formal submissions. We dropped the amendments to MIP24. We added operational support responsibility to set core unit IDs if the governance domain cannot cover them. Risk and governance both updated their budget. There were some discussions around budgeting that I recommend. Then real-world finance updated its mandate to be more detailed. We also have the growth core unit that has been moved into the RFC phase. The two that are new in drafts are governance communications, which had a declaration of intent that passed, and oracles that Nick is working on are still in the drafts phase. He said they would be for a while. Concerning the core units, many big picture conversations were discussed. They involved the clarity and alignment of MakerDAO\u2019s vision objectives and roadmap.  Currently, the concept is that these core units are autonomous teams coming from the bottom up. It can be helpful for us to have something that stands across time. Schuppi brought this up; a small working group with governance started to draft what this process might look like for us through the DAO. Standardization at a higher level is also an important topic. Core units are drafted by everyone bringing their own stack. There were things such as should MKR vesting be at a high level where it\u2019s across all contributors or all facilitators. We\u2019ve discussed standardizing some of the budgeting processes to assign a governance multi-sig where the funds will only go directly into there. Then core units themselves could use their own multi-sig or their own process to pull those funds out. The idea is to minimize some of the friction points for proposing, drafting or making a core unit come to life. Anna is going to share an internal hackathon for the community development team. She\u2019ll just share a section of the outcome and what a group of people learned from that process. A lot of conversation concerns facilitator remuneration. Please, include your thoughts on how core units might be drafting their own or keep an eye out in general. As we\u2019re developing these core units, we have a lot of talent coming into the system. People will begin to either leave the foundation or transitioning into the DAO. We\u2019ll see a lot of talent move in and out. We don\u2019t have the smoothest DAO onboarding process as of yet. However, that is something that I\u2019ve heard a lot of interest from various community members around.   Juan: If anyone has a core unit going live or voting sooner than later and they want to host a call, reach out, and we\u2019ll happily host you. Also, if we happen to miss anything on the board, please, ping Amy or me. We\u2019ll correct it as soon as possible. Thanks LongForWisdom: Great, thank you, Amy and Juan. Amy had mentioned the operational support and governance. We\u2019re running into the point where we need to figure out medium-term goals for the DAO as a whole, which is the priority of this working group. This is exciting because these are complex governance and coordination problems.  Community Development Anna Kryukova 27:10 1534\u00d71004 111 KB  My name is Anna. Some of you might know me from community development. Today I wanted to speak about the state of comm-dev of 2021 and some of the things we\u2019ve been working on. Just to reiterate and remind everyone, the Foundation\u2019s purpose is to bootstrap MakerDAO, which also includes bootstrapping a community development function that you can think about as a department but also as a group of people made up of some foundation employees, including independent contributors, and even simply community members and stakeholders that are working together on various projects to benefit MakerDAO.  1198\u00d7714 204 KB 1220\u00d7704 428 KB  Over the last few years, we\u2019ve designed and built and seeded many of these programs and pillars. Some of these are related to learning. One of the projects unveiled last year focused on building this portal for community development that includes many topics such as governance and MakerDAO involved and how anybody can learn about various topics. There are tutorials onboarding, guides, and in-depth resources. Other programs may focus on creating maintenance and doing summaries of these calls of governance and risk. There\u2019s also CDIPS, grants, and a lot of these projects that help create this community. Many things are changing, and the function of this is beginning to shift; we\u2019re moving towards this new paradigm where the function and ways will revolve around empowering community members to self-organize and work on these meaningful projects that benefit the Maker community.  996\u00d7712 316 KB 1194\u00d7712 247 KB  With the introduction of core units, it\u2019s becoming the vehicle where someone in the community can take over a project, redefine it, and run it in the DAO. A lot of what we\u2019ve been working on in community development recognizes that people can take new opportunities. I think about them in three different ways:  1100\u00d7718 235 KB  Over the last couple of weeks, we\u2019ve started thinking a lot about this timeline. It\u2019s not linear, but it does have some markers by which we can judge the timeline.  1086\u00d7712 214 KB 1254\u00d7696 339 KB  To answer this, we introduced this experiment called Hack Future Work.  1094\u00d7722 288 KB  This is almost like an internal hackathon that takes this prompt:  1262\u00d7690 322 KB 1278\u00d7704 471 KB  The results are several units, which were shared in the community development RocketChat. We also had a meeting where many of the core units were presented. One of them was a concept around social Defi, and this was the badges group that we have in the forum. It involved creating a gamified voting experience and proof of reputation. This core unit thought about what it looks like if it were an independent core unit beyond community development. Several other units also included messaging a content production house, community onboarding, various forms of marketing units that presented, and then this design core unit. Actually, this one here is a good example of one of the things we\u2019ve been working on. Shout out to Shea, who designed these fantastic images that I\u2019m using to present with. She\u2019s a community member who created many of these branded assets and will be working on putting together a style guide for anyone in the community who wants to use these assets. Suppose they\u2019re putting together content and community-generated resources. In that case, you can use these to post on the forum, YouTube, and across the ecosystem. That\u2019s just one example of something that we\u2019ve been working on with independent contributors and community development.  1194\u00d7708 404 KB  Then, as we rendered this hackathon, we had some takeaways and feedback.  1192\u00d7702 358 KB  LongForWisdom: Thank you, Anna. How is the whole group feeling as a whole, and what are the various options for getting involved? Is it going positively?  Anna: I think this is really a great exercise for us to take as a group. I have to recognize that there are different paths. The programs aren\u2019t only to continue to run on autopilot. There are going to be other paths that people can take. I think this experience is positive in many ways and surfaced many of these questions that we just did a retro yesterday. Actually, I\u2019m hoping to share more of this as time goes on, maybe on the following calls. There are questions to go over, such as what are the discussions that this surfaced? How are people feeling? What could be helpful? Overall, it\u2019s positive, and everyone\u2019s excited that there\u2019s a lot of various opportunities.   Iant: One of the questions I\u2019ve always had sitting in the back of my mind is performance and performance assessment. When people are brought on, I would assume there must be some sort of framework that the community operates under that determines whether or not someone is succeeding or not performing at their position. That is then voted upon by Maker holders to some extent? I have no idea. Still, I wondered if that\u2019s something that came up and or perhaps cooking in the background for you guys to think about a framework like that.  Anna: I think someone else can add to this. one thing I wanted to add about this surfaced from our hackathon. Whenever we started filling this out, we had to understand how we would judge value, propose something, or explain the value of a core unit whenever it is still uncertain around objectives and goals. This is the part that Amy was talking about. Coming up with a more unified vision will clarify how these core units can fit within these objectives and how someone can describe value. As far as the second piece of the question, I don\u2019t know if someone else wants to answer further. LongForWisdom: Maybe Juan or Amy can elaborate on measuring performance. Amy: There\u2019s a layer that\u2019s talking about individual performance, and then we\u2019re also talking about performance as a core unit. Essentially, the facilitator is the person that is responsible for the performance of that core unit, whether or not they are within the team. They could be a project manager in the team, but then they hold that responsibility. I think we\u2019re talking about facilitators for the core unit that comes up on the core unit level. Each core unit will have its own version of how the team measures its own performance, which intertwines to that higher level of how we know that these facilitators perform the things they said they\u2019re going to do. That\u2019s why we work so hard on getting that mandate to be straightforward and setting objectives. However, as Anna said, that higher level I\u2019ve been hearing about is missing. If we go through a process where everyone agrees on this higher level, then we go, \u2018okay, well did we accomplish this goal?\u2019 it is a little subjective. Still, there are ways that we can measure if we were to accomplish this goal as a group or if there are points that we didn\u2019t accomplish. If we didn\u2019t, what went wrong? We\u2019ll have to perform a collective process to gather that. The other point concerns market competition. If you\u2019re not doing a great job as a core unit, it will be realized at some point. Someone else will actually be able to step up and say, \u2018hey, actually, we want to do it like this.\u2019 LongForWisdom: I think Matthew brought this subject up a few times. The way it\u2019s set up is that you need to apply relative to whether your budget is changing. Or just reapply for budgets regardless. At the very least, the request for more funds is an opportunity for Maker holders to ask what they do with the funds and how well has it been going.   Iant: Cool, thank you, guys.  MIPs Update Charles St. Louis 41:36 1514\u00d7804 78.1 KB 1518\u00d7844 164 KB 1516\u00d7850 107 KB  LongForWisdom: The number 32 is slightly terrifying in terms of how many things might be submitted. It\u2019s going to be fun. We\u2019re going to be combining some of the proposals. For example, the core unit for the MIP set example will go in as one inclusion poll because all the MIPs are interdependent. We may do that for the initial core units and the combination of the mandates, budget, and facilitator mandate. Sam\u2019s asking what\u2019s the Gov poll limit for grouping votes. Sorry, what do you mean by that, Sam?  Sam: It\u2019s not that important. I believe Derek or somebody mentioned there was an upper limit on the number of votes that can be grouped. Derek: Initially, it was about 32. I have to go back and have a look. But we had looked at that, and it\u2019s relatively high.   LongForWisdom: We should be okay. Just for convenience on voting and making polls purposes, we\u2019re going to group some of them. At least the ones that are related, such as the core unit proposals. Alright, so Akiro asked what\u2019s happening with the UNI-LP oracle audits? As far as I know, they\u2019re still ongoing. I believe that Nick is gone at this point, but they\u2019re in progress as far as I know.  ",

                    "content": "Other Presentations and Updates Auctions Performance Presentation Primoz Kordez 47:20 1433\u00d7915 333 KB  This table is covering auctions on Tuesday. To sum up a few stats, about ten million liquidated on Tuesday. Ten million debt is about 260 auctions. Maker collected more or less all the penalty fees, which is 1.2 million.  1272\u00d7560 408 KB  Maker collected most of the penalty fees. 60,000 penalty fees were missing. Most of it was missing on ETH-B auctions. You can see here at the green line how much Maker had collected.  1275\u00d7769 299 KB  Red means that Maker didn\u2019t make a penalty fee, and there was no revenue. This line shows how much vaults got back from the remaining collateral.  1276\u00d7762 295 KB  If vaults have a liquidation ratio of 130 on ETH-B and the penalty fee is 113, there\u2019s 17% that vaults could get back. But since there is no considerable amount of competition amongst keepers, I\u2019d say they make 50 to 20 percent of the money on auction vaults. Basically, we didn\u2019t get anything back on the ETH-B vaults, and that\u2019s because the liquidation ratio is much lower. There\u2019s not much available capital above 113. It\u2019s not necessarily that ETH-B auctions are worse. Keepers take a certain amount of capital, and since the liquidation ratio is lower, that means there\u2019s less left over for vaults. That\u2019s why we\u2019re not proposing lower collateralized vaults. At least until we have liquidations, 2.0 implemented. It\u2019s important to note that there are not many unique bidders. Here is the average number of bidders per auction. You can see that there\u2019s only one or two the majority of the time.    There are more bidders on renBTC. A bidder bid 50,000 DAI for zero renBTC. This vault made quite a high yield. In general, there is quite a lot of irrationality in some bids. You can see that a few bidders bid above market price for renBTC. Whereas if you look at ETH-B, some bids were fairly below market price. This is why keepers made a lot of money here. There\u2019s a similar situation for ETH. It\u2019s not as obvious because the liquidation ratio is higher on average. There are better bids on ETH-A verse ETH-B. One thing that\u2019s positive about this and something that makes us reconsider the auction duration time is how much time it took to get healthy bids. We have a six-hour auction duration because we may get zero bids if it\u2019s too short. Here you can see there\u2019s still a lot of zero bids.  1232\u00d7825 195 KB  On ETH vaults, 20% of all bids are all zero bids. That\u2019s why we have a longer auction duration of six hours. You could see that most of the healthy bids came in earlier, within the first hour. Today, we proposed to shorten the duration from six hours to four hours. This is beneficial for the liquidation capacity. Currently, we can liquidate 15 million, which is the box parameter, every six hours. If you shorten this to four hours, you can make six cycles a day rather than four. I didn\u2019t mention that because the low efficiency of ETH-B vaults makes us propose a higher back value for ETH-B. We have already proposed a higher back value for UNI LPs due to low keeper participation. Suppose we increase the back value for ETH-B, which is the minimum bid increase from 3% to 5%. In that case, we may get more keepers participating or at least improve the bidding. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any downside to this, as vaults already lose all of the value. I think it makes sense. The last proposal we had is to increase the box parameter by a very small amount. Leeks made an excellent analysis; he checked all of the keeper wallets and estimated the amount of capital they hold, over 100 million dollars of capital. It is not all liquid or in stablecoin form. He\u2019s suggesting that a 30 million box would be appropriate. I think the same, but I\u2019m a bit cautious because we are not seeing a lot of competitiveness here among keepers. Even though keepers have more capital, if we increase box, we have a higher amount of liquidation. This means we would have even less competition, and the bids could go even lower. That\u2019s why we proposed a modest increase in box from fifteen to twenty million. This is our proposal analytics:  864\u00d7906 303 KB  To shorten the auction and bid duration for all flips to four hours, increase blocks from 15 to 20 million, and decrease back for UNI LPs and ETH-B from 3% to 5%. That\u2019s pretty much it, but there\u2019s one other thing that we also need to address. It concerns gas prices. A lot of auctions got kicked with a certain delay. For instance, here is one vault with the total amount of debt liquidated at 1.5 million. It took almost one hour to start the auction, which is a considerable delay. It shouldn\u2019t happen like that. This is happening because kicks are expensive due to gas prices. A kick can cost about $800 in gas. Now imagine this for 500 auctions. That\u2019s about $150k, and there\u2019s not a massive advantage of kicking an auction. There\u2019s no incentive to kick it, and that\u2019s why we have these delays. One idea to fix these problems is that we should have several actors performing these kicks. These people would have to get funded, and they would potentially perform these kicks to keep auctions ongoing.  Discussion 57:20  Iant: Primoz, I agree entirely with you, and I volunteer to do that right now. I spent $88,000 in kicks on Tuesday night. I\u2019m happy to volunteer to help work something out. Thank you for your analysis here.  Primoz: Thank you. I spoke with DeFi saver guys today. They said they saved a bunch of Maker loans. Yeah, I think they represent 40 million of debt, so they probably are protecting 200 million of that. They probably spent 400 ETH in fees, well, the users who pay from the collateral. Gas prices are getting really high to manage liquidations or protection.   SamM: I just want to say that liquidations 2.0 solves this issue because there\u2019s a built-in incentivization system. We need a solution until we get liquidations 2.0.  Kurt: Not to rain on your parade, but it\u2019s not actually confident that it solves it because those transactions are done in the clear and can be front-run by generalized front runners. You\u2019re still at risk of the commons\u2019 tragedy where you know to determine a vault is under collateralized requires you to do work; you have to run a continuous database of vaults and keep track of all of them as well as servicing the ones that are undercollateralized. However, if you always get front-run when you try to liquidate something, that could still eat away the incentive no matter how large it is because you can be bid up to whatever the value of the incentive is on the gas price. So it\u2019s not entirely clear whether or not this solves the problem. BrianMcMichael: Even without the front runners, the gas is a fixed rate plus a percentage of the vault. When we see two thousand or three thousand gwei transactions, we could easily get to a case where the recompense doesn\u2019t cover the gas to kick it off. We might still need a backstop for liquidations 2.0. d_zap: To chime in really quickly and add to what Primoz said, if the other advantage of passing this over to Maker is that it will be organized or coordinated, somebody could write a contract to kick lots of auctions at once, which will save money. With every individual kick, you\u2019ve got a 21,000 gas baseline for what the transaction costs. In contrast, obviously, if you string together 100 kicks, then you will save that much from every auction. That\u2019s definitely more efficient if you have a huge number to get through. BrianMcMichael: That\u2019s actually a super simple contract to write. You still need somebody to handle the database and monitor the blockchain and outstanding vaults, which is still a resource-intensive task. There is still some expense that isn\u2019t directly reflected on-chain there. Primoz: It\u2019s good to have more than one actor doing this. We don\u2019t want everybody to rely on this one actor. If something fails, it\u2019s a problem. We need a backup as well. A few people doing this would make sense. Kurt: We\u2019re researching ways to possibly mitigate that front-running threat on the kicks. In 2.0, so far, there\u2019s no clear solution that makes the problem go entirely away. We have solutions that decrease the severity. We\u2019d also prefer to not have a single centralized entity that relies on kicking auctions. BrianMcMichael: Maybe we don\u2019t want to do liquidations when gas is 3,000 gwei anyway. Even if we kick them off, who will bid on them? It might be its own kind of stock market circuit breaker that prevents us from getting zero bids anyways. LongForWisdom: One other point is that if we end up getting EIP-1559, that changes the fee market, right? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s positive or negative, but that probably affects how high the gas can spike for how long. Christopher Mooney: We might get an opcode where we could maybe use the opcode to compensate people. LongForWisdom: I\u2019ve heard that before as well. Kurt: The hope for EIP-1559 is it reduces the volatility in gas. The average price will still be the same, but if it makes things more predictable, it would probably help compensate for it. LongForWisdom: One minor note about the kick incentive is that I don\u2019t know if it has to exceed the cost of gas for it to be worthwhile because you still potentially get to all the auctions. It may not always need to exceed the kick cost but just offset it by 80 or 90%. BrianMcMichael: We need to have the incentives aligned. We don\u2019t pay people to call drip right now. They\u2019re incentivized to do it. Maybe we need to think about the incentive mechanism behind it. Primoz: Auctions should get kicked, and that\u2019s why we have this. However, one vault wasn\u2019t kicked for a few hours, and he was able to save himself. It\u2019s not something we would want to rely on, of course. Many vaults are active; if you look at the largest ones in the last six hours, they can save themselves. JoeQ: I just want to add, something we can consider is a lot of this is happening at three or four o\u2019clock in the morning. I know we\u2019re transitioning to four-hour durations, and I\u2019m really happy about that. Still, we have it extended out for specific timeframes because some people go to sleep, and the market goes way against them. That\u2019s something to think about.   Kurt: While we\u2019re on the subject of making certain liquidations happen reliably, various external projects are working on solving these problems with a sort of cooperative game theory. One example that people might be familiar with is b-protocol which is actually built on Maker protocol. They have dedicated liquidators that line up and volunteer to liquidate things in a predetermined deterministic fashion. You don\u2019t have everything going to the miners or just no guarantee of return. I think that\u2019s an interesting avenue to explore as well.  Christopher Mooney: Joe, you\u2019ll work the mandated actors, and we\u2019ll establish something even if we have to use the multi-sig that the mandated actors set up. I just want to make sure that this problem is solved as soon as possible. JoeQ: I\u2019ll coordinate with Primoz and the community to figure something out. Primoz had mentioned there should be a backup actor. There\u2019s so much money at risk. I believe that\u2019s necessary. Christopher Mooney: I\u2019ll volunteer to be a backup. Iant: I\u2019ll volunteer independently as well.   LongForWisdom: Great to see some concrete actions come of that.  Open Discussion 01:08:45  LongForWisdom: I believe the crux of the question concerns how Maker holders can judge how well core units are doing. You have many Maker holders not paying attention to what\u2019s going on.  Juan: One of the solutions that Matt brought up during the last call was to make sure that it\u2019s not the default, yes. Someone can stay complacent forever. As you mentioned earlier, there\u2019s the budget, so as long as we make the budget non-default, yes, then it should be fine. The coordinates should fight a bit to keep providing value to the DAO and show that the budget is useful. It\u2019s essential to find the right balance. You don\u2019t want to hire someone and tell them they have employment security for the next day and a half, but let\u2019s see what happens after that. Christopher Mooney: We have to find a model, right? I agree that it\u2019s going to be difficult. How will we effectively fire teams for not performing? The easiest thing I could think of is an annual review where MKR holders either re-elect that team for the next year or the team gets axed. That\u2019s probably the easiest one to start. For measurement, we should set out our goals for the year, and MKR holders will see what percentage of the goals have been met. Juan: Yeah, but you can do the same with the budget. That\u2019s what I meant. Each core unit is proposing a budget for three months. We could extend it for longer. Matthew Rabinowitz: Maybe it\u2019s possible to not only set it as binary zero and one but to have the same budget and some scale between zero and two hundred percent chunked into 25%. You can combine what Chris outlined as you maybe only met 75% of your targets, but perhaps that was just the situation. Maybe the budget shouldn\u2019t change, or perhaps it needs to be increased for performance. Juan: Totally, and another tool that we\u2019re using for this is that a core unit could potentially have several budgets. As an example, we\u2019d like to try with Amy bootstrapping a grants program. One of the budgets that we\u2019re going to propose is purely for grants. If governance doesn\u2019t think this is a good idea, the rest of the core unit could vote on the general budget and vote down on this grant budget that we will try to incorporate.   LongForWisdom: I think that it should be interesting to see how it would work. Forcing an annual vote may not work in some cases. For example, the governance team is not doing well. There\u2019s an annual vote; it will be difficult for governance to vote to ax the only team or the only smart contracts team. There needs to be some way of governance expressing dissatisfaction where an alternative can put themselves together. Having no one is worse than having someone who is not doing good in some cases.  Christopher Mooney: You could bake that in at the end.   Juan: This was less of a controversial topic than we thought. Iant: In terms of this specific problem in this structure, we use moving forward to analyze it or build a solution. Is it on com dev, or is there no real team that is quote on quote responsible for figuring this thing out? The way I see it, this will require research and then hopefully a testing phase of some sort.  Juan: The short answer is no. this is not assigned to a specific team. This is something that we could work towards. However, because this is a DAO, I trust a lot in the smart people I\u2019m working with. If something is not working, I will find a way to fix it. I think looking for every contingency in advance may not be the best solution. We will find a way, and we will share the best practice as we go along. LongForWisdom: I think what you\u2019d find is that the other domains are the first to notice if one of the core units isn\u2019t doing a great job. What I expect to happen is that when it comes around to annual renewal time, the rest of the core units would have organized an alternative on the down-low so that governance has a choice which would be the smoothest reaction. This may lead to some bad feelings for the existing people but to some extent, that\u2019s unavoidable. Juan: I think we\u2019ll find an organic solution. As long as we keep attracting the right talent, we should be fine. Derek: Juan, I\u2019m thinking that there shouldn\u2019t be any surprises for a team throughout the year if we\u2019re diligently focused on our expenditures, tasks accomplished, and tasks that haven\u2019t been accomplished for certain reasons. It should be known as we go throughout the year to stand with the community and other domain teams. I\u2019m hoping that will be quite open, and if we\u2019re falling below the mark, we know we need to step up. Juan: I agree. Maybe some core units are scratching an itch that won\u2019t be there a year from now. I think you\u2019re thinking about the essential core units. The most essential ones will always be there. Some other core units are more experimental. For example, if there is a goal of expanding DAI into the Antarctic and then three months later, this isn\u2019t going as expected, or it\u2019s going great, that\u2019s why organically, we will expect a lot of reporting. Seb has been working on that. There are various initiatives on reporting transparency. LongForWisdom: There are sub proposals to add, remove, modify or replace core units, right? Juan: There is the possibility. LongForWisdom: There are governance processes to do these things, but in practice, we haven\u2019t done them. We don\u2019t know what the fallout will be. Juan: In the coordinate MIPs, we tried to cover these cases where someone can propose, for example, they want to offboard this guy or onboard someone, and then there are emergency procedures as emergency core unit facilitators if something is not going as planned. We are trying to think of worst-case scenarios and make it work. Amy is saying that the challenge is who does the challenge. That\u2019s very interesting. Sometimes, the issue with human beings may be that we don\u2019t want to be the bad guys in the room, and therefore we don\u2019t give the most honest feedback. Matthew Rabinowitz: At the end of the day, MKR has everybody working on this together. Collectively speaking, it\u2019s the money of all MKR holders. Therefore, the vote of that matters. Juan: Any other comments or questions? LongForWisdom: There\u2019s a lot more that I could say, but we\u2019re getting close to the time, and it makes more sense to discuss on the forum.   Christopher Mooney: When we\u2019re thinking about budgets, we have the real risk of running into the same issue that governments run into where the voters vote with their emotions. There may be a point in the future where our income falls like it was in the depths of the bear market. This would require a contingency for what we do with teams and our budget if we begin to run out of money at that point. We have to be careful with what we approve.  LongForWisdom: You\u2019re right, Chris. that situation is inevitable, and we will cross that bridge when we come to it. Let\u2019s wrap this up now. Thank you, everyone, for coming and discussing today, and I look forward to seeing you on the forum and next week\u2019s call.

Keeper bidding came in around an hour after most OSM triggers, but the suggestion is to change the TTL to 4 hours for more efficiency and for more bidding. kicks are a bit expensive, almost $300 when gas is high, which is why there was a little delay to start auctions. Lix actually estimated Keeper liquidity by wallet. The modest suggestion is to change the box to 20 million. One highlight is an altruistic keeper did 88k in kick volume on Tuesday night. Moving forward until liquidations 2.0 launches, avoiding a tragedy of the commons is crucial to liquidations success. See more of that discussion on the replay video   ",

My name is LongForWisdom. I am the governance facilitator at MakerDAO. As usual, we\u2019ve got a bit of an agenda to go through. We\u2019ve got our regular updates by the usual suspects. We\u2019ve also got a segment from SebVentures talking about the financials of MakerDAO in January, which should be interesting. We like it when people get involved, so please feel free to interrupt and voice any opinions or comments. We would love to hear from you.  Weekly Update  There haven\u2019t really been any significant governance updates for the last week. I posted a set of Core Units proposals for the governance domain. They\u2019ll be on RFC for the next month, and then we\u2019ll go into the March cycle. Please read them over and leave comments. The RFC period is made for any objections and edits. We had four polls this week. Which had all passed. These polls were onboarding polls for the DAI-USDC-UNISWAP-V2-LP token and the ETH-USDT-UNISWAP-V2-LP token. They should be on Friday, but we should check with the smart contracts on a preferred date. We had an oracle poll creating multiple oracles for DYDX on Starkware, which also passed. And then, we had polls to investigate the implementation of an ETH-C vault type with a higher liquidation ratio, which also passed. Next week, we\u2019ll have more polls as usual; We\u2019ll have the rates proposal poll along with some onboarding polls as well. Let\u2019s look out for those on Monday. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Updates Peyton Rose Governance at a Glance 03:13 Three-Point Summary  Demand surge continues with over 1.75B in DAI supply. Our Surplus Buffer continues to fill at a moderate rate, currently sitting just under 6M DAI at the time of writing. The DAI VWAP holds steady (currently at $1.001), despite continued volatility in ETH.  ICYMI - Announcements  The January Maker Governance Review 4 is live and really something! The Rates Group published new recommendations 2 that will be polled for inclusion on Monday, Feb. 8th.  Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated.  Discussions   Undercollateralized loans in Maker  Hasu makes a case for a new type of loan to be brought to Maker.    Core Units I Wished Existed  Iammeeoh gives everyone a space to discuss Core Units they would like to see here at Maker. Check out the community ideas and leave one of your own!    Signal Requests   IAM-DC Parameters: WBTC-A, LINK-A, UNI-A, COMP-A, YFI-A, AAVE-A   Signal Ending Soon! Just one more day left to give Primoz your opinion on the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module levels for the above collateral types. Inclusion poll slated for Monday, Feb 8th.    Adjust ETH-A DC-IAM-line (2021-04)   Ultraschuppi signals raising the ETH-A debt ceiling for the 4th time in 2021. You might be noticing a trend at this point.    Raise DSR  Signal Continues @ultraschuppi signals for varying levels of increase to the Dai Savings Rate, which has been at 0% since September.    Adjust the Surplus Buffer  Signal Continues @ultraschuppi signals the raising of the Surplus Buffer, with options to continue MKR buyback and burn operations during the raise.    Ongoing Initiatives    Collateral Calls - Calling all Projects!  Juanjuan sets up a signup thread for projects wishing to present on the bi-weekly collateral call. Know any potential collateral partners that want to present? Refer them here.    Collateral Status Index  Confused about the current status of the various collateral types that have been discussed recently? Check out this post to find out the status and current position of each within the onboarding process.    Weekly MIPs Updates  Davidutro and charlesstlouis bring the latest updates in the world of MIPs.    MakerDAO Standard Governance Processes  LongForWisdom writes a brief overview of the currently operating governance processes in the Maker community. Confused between Signals, Declarations, and MIPs? Look no further.    The Official Welcome Thread  A welcome and introductions thread. Not strictly speaking governance, but if anyone new or old wants to introduce themselves, now is your chance!    Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 06:40  Last week, we completed the executive for the DC Instant Access Module for FA. That has successfully passed. We finished two collateral assessments for next week, which are UNI-V2-UNI-F and UNI-V2-LINK-F. Both of these are UNI LP tokens. We\u2019ve done a little work on the Dss.Exec lib. We\u2019ve put a lot of work in on MIP45 for liquidations 2.0. Since MIP45 is in the RFC phase, we\u2019ve got approximately two to three weeks where we could make some changes. Therefore, if anybody sees anything or wants to comment on something, now\u2019s the time to do it. For the coming week, MIP21 or MIP22 may not make it onto Kovan, depending on the reviews. However, we are reviewing both of those as we\u2019ve got time off from liquidations 2.0. For this Friday\u2019s executive, we\u2019re going to have UNI-V2-UNI-F and UNI-V2-LINK-F. We still need to work on an assessment for UNI-V2-AAVE-F.  Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 08:50  Last night, I published the oracle assessments for UNI-ETH, LINK-ETH, and AAVE-ETH. I still have one more coming, which is the CF drop assessment. I\u2019ve also deployed the oracles for the collateral types going out this week, which are ETH-USDT and DAI-USDC. We\u2019re pumping on all cylinders!  Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 09:56  Regarding collateral evaluations, there\u2019s a focus on the UNI LP\u2019s we\u2019re publishing, which are for UNI-ETH and LINK-ETH. They have evaluations this week. We may onboard them next week. We\u2019ll be proceeding to AAVE-ETH and maybe YFI-ETH UNI LP evaluations during next week. We published the first batch mentioned debt ceiling instant access module parameters for six major vault types. I made the signal request on the line parameter, which is the maximum debt ceiling parameter with some proposed numbers. Prose mentioned that the winning quotes will go into the launching poll next week. Next week, we\u2019re planning to release the last batch of these parameters for other vault types. There was a discussion whether we should implement the debt ceiling instant access module for renBTC into the model executive. We might hit the debt ceiling before the end of next week. There is still 35 million unutilized debt. However, it\u2019s not growing as extreme for ETH-A. We are probably fine, but we also can\u2019t exclude it. I\u2019m leaving this decision for LongForWisdom because this may have implications for governance. The rates group released the monthly rates proposal. We proposed a modest rate increase for major vault types. We included forwarding guidance where we considered the possibility to make additional rate increase before the end of this month, especially if we still see extreme debt growth on ETH-A. Please comment on proposed changes and stay tuned if we may need to propose another rate increase before the end of the month. Yesterday we released sub-proposals for the core unit mandate and the budget. Let us know if you have any recommendations on the structure we have in mind and our proposed budget. Finally, we began studying liquidations 2.0 assets. We are also looking into the ETH-C vault type, which has a high liquidation ratio. These vaults are supported by Maker holders this week, so we proposed some potential liquidation ratios and risk premiums for this vault type in case we might want to implement it soon. This could be beneficial if we\u2019re going to move some of this debt growth from ETH-A to ETH-C or begin considering high rates on ETH-A.  LongForWisdom: Great, Thank you, Primoz. I\u2019ll briefly speak about W-BTC. We mentioned increasing the line this Friday if it were needed. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a position where there\u2019s an apparent urgency given that W-BTC hasn\u2019t been rising as much relative to ETH. We can do it next Friday as long as the poll passes.    S\u00e9bastien Derivaux Real World Assets 14:23  For Real World Assets, I have three updates:  We have published a real-world finance Core Unit for future Core Units, an experiment to provide transparency among the team. Check it out and give your opinions. We are moving forward on People\u2019s Company. It was greenlit last week. However, we are negotiating with them on new terms because the loan to value of 18% was a bit high. If you are interested in knowing more detailed information about that, please ping me on RocketChat. I can use your feedback on the negotiation. Finally, we are still working on how to scale RWAs. We are figuring out details such as using an asset manager instead of asset originators and using trust instead of SPVS managed by the asset originators themselves, which is an issue for many people. When we make a more significant investment, it will require more safety.   Matthew Rabinowitz: Concerning any 6S updates, please stay tuned in the forums. Within the next two weeks, you\u2019ll see a lot of content in there.  LongForWisdom: Thank you, Seb. It\u2019s exciting to see that move forward as well. Matthew Rabinowitz: Actually, I need to work with you on how we\u2019re going to publish so many documents. We\u2019ll have to figure that out. LongForWisdom: Sure, get in touch with me anytime.    Juan Operational Support Update 16:59  Yesterday, we had REINNO from RWAs. Next Wednesday, we\u2019re skipping the collateral onboarding call. We\u2019ll have Know Your MIP number five; it talks about the integration with yield protocol. On the 17th, we\u2019re going to have Fortunafi from RWAs again. This Friday, the 5th, Prose, and Sam will be discussing the Keg regarding the Know Your MIP; That\u2019s Know Your MIP number four.  This coming Wednesday, the 10th, we\u2019ll have MIP43 TLM, which is the term lending module. Alan and Lev are going to discuss this MIP. Please join us on Wednesday at 6 PM UTC. Concerning the core units update, risk, real-world finance, and governance have posted their proposals for comments. They are in the forums for any feedback. We\u2019ve seen other proposals being drafted. Derek drafted two; one for smart contracts and another one for front-end. Apparently, he does them in his free time, so if you want yours drafted by Derek, reach out to him. We have strategy communications PR and Marketing from Caitlin or Kathleen (I don\u2019t want to butcher the name). Finally, Amy and I are drafting one for ops support. Please, contribute by giving feedback on those. If you\u2019re thinking about doing a core unit or joining one, you should know that we have the Core Units I Wish Existed thread by Iammeeoh. Then there\u2019s the TL;DR Core Unit MIPs Submission Process from Amy. Finally, we have the channel on Rocketchat #core-units-operating- model-onboarding. If you need help or want to discuss anything, please join us there. Regarding Maker\u2019s public events, there\u2019s this Google calendar that you can add. If you want to be in the know, you can reach us over there and see what\u2019s happening with MakerDAO, or as always in the forums.  Comments  Frank Cruz: The REINNO call you had yesterday, Juan, had a tough crowd. Anybody who hasn\u2019t watched that should check it out. It\u2019s good to see the community come out and really hammer down on MIP6. It\u2019s not easy to understand, but it\u2019s a really good video. I wanted to ask real quick; do you guys think it would be a good idea to have a core unit for the Clubhouse app to give Maker a little more attention? I was hoping you could promote it. Actually, Nick, I saw you on there, maybe you or Anna could start the room?  Juan: I think core units, in general, should focus on providing value, regardless of the means that they use. Therefore, if the oracle\u2019s core unit thinks that they should do something on Clubhouse that provides value to the DAO or the wider community, then, by all means, this might be a great idea. However, I don\u2019t think that we should create core units around tools or mediums. Nonetheless, it\u2019s whatever the DAO and the Maker holders want. If this is something that the Maker holders agree with, go ahead and publish it. Frank: Yeah, I know. I was just being sarcastic. But I really do think that it\u2019s a good tool. It\u2019s getting popular. I\u2019ve been noticing many other projects going on there, such as DeFi. I\u2019m wondering if some of us can get together and start something. I was being sarcastic about the core unit but maybe start something like a clubhouse. Juan, you\u2019d be good at it. You can be a moderator or anybody else here you guys would want to nominate. In any case, it\u2019s getting a lot of traction. I think it\u2019d be a good way to get the word out about DAI, Maker, and what we do as a community. It\u2019s something that\u2019s needed, in my opinion. Juan: Thanks for the confidence, Frank. There are definitely core units considering different mediums. It\u2019s a good suggestion.    ",

If you\u2019re interested in seeing the replay, here it is. In community development, a working group called Governance Communications is publishing the Maker Relay, snippets of this call, and summaries. As Peyton was saying, we also have a monthly recap of the governance process. Beginning next month, we\u2019ll be experimenting with a new format to continue to provide more value with other updates that we already have, such as Governance at a Glance and the MIPs update. This month, we also had a trial experiment with an audio format; We had community members create updates in podcast form. All four episodes are out, which you can check out on anchor and Youtube.

I believe a couple of these MIPs going out are high impact. We hit the governance rewards MIP, which can make waves either in a good or bad way. Then there are all sorts of MIPs changing how the DAO is structured and will function going forwards. If there\u2019s ever going to be a month where we\u2019ll have extra time to spend reading and commenting on MIPs, this might be a good month.  Other Presentations and Updates Sebastien Derivaux January Financial Presentation 34:30  I took some numbers from general analytics to understand the financial results of MakerDAO. I\u2019m quite interested in the money that the protocol is creating. I always wanted to know how much my MKR took in investment because lately, the market is not too happy with MKR tokens. They prefer projects like AAVE. I put some numbers up, so I could try to discuss them with you.  1673\u00d7926 169 KB  This is a monthly update. You have all the numbers for the months. in January, we have generated two and a half million DAI of net interest incomes. I use banking terms just like you would see in a banking quarterly annual presentation. We have the same wording as the rest of the banking community. If you want to share this document with an investor, they will understand the terms\u2014at least some investors. The net income difference in a bank is the difference between the interest you get and the interest you pay to the borrowers through the lenders. Currently, our primary lenders are DAI holders. They are happy to lend their money for exactly zero percent interest while the DSI is zero percent. We have no cost on that front. Every interest we make is for us. You can see there has been a massive increase since December. If you compare it to the rise since January 2020, obviously, it\u2019s an insane number. The second line is a bit more challenging to understand. The trading income is when you buy and sell, and in a bank, you can buy and sell currencies. However, you can also buy and sell securities such as stocks, bonds, and etc. In that line, I also put the PSM. We buy USDC for 0.1% less than what it\u2019s worth, and we sell DAI for 0.1% more than what it\u2019s worth. For December, there is a significant number, and it\u2019s not the PSM. I put all the USDC-A vault with no liquidation on them. USDT is not inside. However, USDT is not a big deal. Trading income is all the USDC-A vault, which is relevant because we can only interest those because DAI is above one dollar. There is no reason for someone to put one dollar of collateral to get less than one dollar of a loan. Still, with the PSM, it\u2019s a bit different because it\u2019s a good reason to make money. After all, the DAI peg was great all along through January. Therefore, it\u2019s still a fair amount of money. The third line is net liquidation income. That\u2019s the difference between the money we create when we liquidate someone and the money we lose when the liquidation fails. We lose some money, so we don\u2019t have the split per vault. It\u2019s monthly; there\u2019s only one number. It\u2019s positive if it\u2019s a win, and it\u2019s negative if it\u2019s a loss. I didn\u2019t expect six of the revenues were due to liquidation income. Lastly, this is a new line, which is the workforce expenses. All the expenses you can have, and currently, there is only the Vault Compensation Working Group. You add up those numbers, and you get the net income. I insert the recurring income below because you can expect that the trading and liquidation fluctuate month over month. We hope that liquidations are not a significant number because it\u2019s not suitable for customers. Hence, recurring income is what we can expect to earn, which includes the workforce expenses.  1674\u00d7867 128 KB  This is the same representation in a graph but since November 2019. You can see the workforce expenses, which has a tiny line. Maybe this will grow soon. You have the net interest income, which was significant in early 2020. Later it became zero because the interest was zero. After all, we had a DAI issue, and then we raised interests again. Now we\u2019re making a lot of money. Net trading income was the solution. If you take the aggregate, you would think we make the same amount of money every month since October, but that\u2019s not true. The net trading income was due to the peg issue. If you remove that, you\u2019ll see that the net interest income grows month after month. That\u2019s very good for our business. You have a net liquidation income that is positive most months. However, we had an issue here that cost us a lot of money. I hope liquidation 2.0 will solve that.  797\u00d7462 76.6 KB  Let\u2019s go to the lending business, which is the net interest margin. The income is 2.5 million last month. We also have the average yield. You see that ETH-A is still the most significant vault type. The rest of the revenues are not marginal except for WBTC. You have the average yield we make on the loans we provide to our customers, which is rising. It will continue to increase through February because we will increase the rates.  794\u00d7465 73.5 KB  Trading income is all stablecoin vaults and the PSM. I expect the PSM to increase in revenues. Currently, the primary user of the PSM is 1inch, but maybe other people will soon use it as well. I put it in a specific slide because I think the trading business can become significant at a later point.  796\u00d7458 54.9 KB 797\u00d7505 88.9 KB  At some point, we will add the oracle business when we begin to get revenues from that. Something important to note is that the only reason we make a lot of money is that DAI is valuable. People are lending us money with no interest, so if the DAI demand increases, we will be able to invest all this capital into something which will create more money. However, the biggest problem is to have people who lend you money at zero percent. That\u2019s not easy to find. I focus on the stablecoin on-chain volume in billions of dollars transacted. You have an increase in all the stablecoins since the beginning. If you do a market share analysis, you\u2019ll see that we started very low. We lost a considerable amount of market share after March because people were not happy with what happened on Black Thursday. Then there was the Yield Farming Season, which grew yet again. I suggest it\u2019s due to the peg issue. Since we have sold the peg, it\u2019s gradually rising over time. We also decrease USDT, and many people from USDT are moving to USDC or BUSD. Here you have more numbers on the different evolution of the market share. The main focus for Maker should be to increase the stablecoin on-chain volume from 12% to 50%.  793\u00d7464 69.1 KB  I want to express the risk protocol phase by using the surplus buffer and comparing it to the total amount of loan assets we have. By doing the math, you can figure out the leverage ratio, which is just the surplus buffer divided by all the assets of Maker. You end up with this blue line, which, as you can see it has improved. It was relatively high before Black Thursday. After that, it improved because we increased the surplus buffer many times. Still, you can see it\u2019s decreasing during the last month because the demand for ETH loans is growing faster than the surplus buffer. I added a metric called the CET-1 ratio for common equity in the banking community. I don\u2019t remember the last symbol, but you are using the surplus buffer divided by assets. Hence, you say that not all assets are equal. The ETH-B loans are risky. I put a factor of times two, and that is this red line, which is growing because we had onboarded a lot of USDC tokens. This is a systematic or regulatory risk but not a day-to-day risk. You see toward the end that it\u2019s been dropping a lot since October. The asset size is not growing much relative to the surplus buffer. Actually, all the stablecoins are slowly disappearing, and we onboard more risky assets such as ETH loans. That maybe be something to keep in mind. To give you a little bit of context, for banks, the leverage ratio should be 3% at least, and the CET-1 ratio should be 8%. However, we are not a regular bank. We should work to see what is relevant to us.  795\u00d7508 70.7 KB  The final slide is interesting for all the Maker token holders. This takes the same numbers but applies them to the MKR token. You have the recurring earnings per MKR every month. For January, for every MKR token you hold, you make 2.5 dollars of capital because the capital stays inside the MKR token, which increased the surplus buffer. However, it\u2019s still your MKR. the current rise is quite interesting. The orange line depicts the recurring earnings yield, which is annualized. It\u2019s the earning on an annual basis divided by the price of MKR at the average price of the month. When earnings are rising, this line is growing. Luckily in January, this line has went below the recurring earning per MKR because the MKR price had tripled. However, the earning yield stayed around 2%. Suppose you want to use the price-earnings ratio. In that case, the ratio is just the opposite of the 2%. A ratio of fifty is still good compared to Tesla and all protocols.  Presentation Discussion 51:57  Chris: Great presentation. LongForWisdom: I speak for everyone when I say that everyone is very appreciative.  Sebastien Derivaux: Should I continue next month? It takes half the day. I think I got the answer.   LongForWisdom: Great, does anybody want to share comments or questions with Seb? I\u2019ll kick one-off. A lot of the increase in revenues has been correlated with the bullish sentiment in crypto. How much of this revenue and usage should we expect to stay if the bullishness decreases?  Sebastien Derivaux: I don\u2019t have any answer but what I want to say is that we need to work on one subject to know our own liabilities. We have over one billion DAI outstanding. We need to know how much is used to farm or on protocols and how much people use for daily purposes. I have DAI in some protocols to earn yield, but there\u2019s no need to have DAI if there\u2019s no yield. Otherwise, I would have ETH. This is important because, say, you can earn 2% on the amount of DAI outstanding. If this amount decreases to 100 million, that\u2019s a different story. The minimum is the amount of DAI used by non-farming activities. LongForWisdom: One other thing I noticed about the space, in general, is if you go to the etherscan tab for DAI, all these addresses for pools and various things are illiquid. This is essentially what you\u2019re saying in terms of farming. A lot of the demand comes from liquidity pools. In the case of stablecoin liquidity pools, I\u2019m not sure how sticky that is if there were to be a bearish sentiment, right? Sebastien Derivaux: The curve of the Uniswap can be sticky because you always need to translate ETH to DAI and vice versa. However, some others like Band bridge or the algorithmic stablecoins. I\u2019m not sure if there is still one, but there were many farming activities on those, which will disappear. LongForWisdom: Yeah, it makes sense. Sebastien Derivaux: That\u2019s really what we need to focus on because we could see many onboarding new collaterals and prevailing projects. In the end, what matters is to have people happy to hold some DAI because if they switch to USDC, we are dead. LongForWisdom: I think the focus on the product has mainly been the default right because of the DAI peg-like issue. Up to this point, demand has been exceeding supply, which has been great, but that\u2019s not necessarily always the case, as you\u2019re saying. Does anybody want to share? Matthew Rabinowitz: Hopefully, people are using DAI as a liquid medium of exchange. In that regard, if it trades at its peg, you\u2019ll never really know who\u2019s farming and who\u2019s using it in the real world. The fact that it can be farmed is a spectacular use case. Who knows what else it\u2019ll be used for. Concerning the question regarding the general valuation of MKR attributed to the crypto bullishness, I hope it\u2019s driven by earnings and multiple earnings thereof. The more assets and collateral we bring, the more earnings we\u2019ll have, which improves the valuation. Sebastien Derivaux: Yeah, I see in the chat that Chris says that he has a large position he used in the real world. However, if it\u2019s in the real world, it\u2019s no longer DAI. he had to sell the DAI to the people. It\u2019s the same if we integrate real-world assets; the DAI will stay in DeFi, so we need some people who have DAI on their wallets. The most sticky reason is to transact. For example, when you want to buy a coffee, everyone has a real wallet, which needs cash. When you do a transaction, you need to monitor the money directly. That\u2019s why you want to have some reserve of liquidity. Nonetheless, we need to be the winner on the volume transacted.   LongForWisdom: Seeing many good comments. If anybody wants to put these in the recording, that might be good. Greg or Chris?  Greg: If you look at DAI\u2019s structuring behind the scenes, it\u2019s not as conducive to payments as USDC. It\u2019s going to be very hard for us to beat them at that game. They have unlimited liquidity from the legacy system. In theory, we have to use USDC to get it. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t make much sense to have people onboard USDC to onboard DAI and use that as a payment currency. For savings, DAI can beat all of them. The way I think of it is to start a cycle. Hence, you need to fill all the functions of money. You need a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value. Still, you need to pick one to start with and get a sink into that vertical. Then, once that builds, you can have the others come organically. I think the one that we build to sync with is savings. Akiva Dubrofsky: I think there\u2019s a significant usage for DAI and structured products, especially when the DSR comes back. That\u2019s a project I\u2019m working on. More people will be working on it using DAI and DSR and structured products to stimulate a lot of demand. Greg: Yes, it\u2019s temporary. It\u2019s going to go away at some point because it\u2019s unsustainable. You can view it as subsidizing our DSR. It\u2019s sort of like a DSR, you\u2019re getting savings to return, and it\u2019s going to eventually go away. We can replace it with the actual DSR when that happens. Sebastien Derivaux: In that case, it means that the DSR is above what is the natural market rate. It\u2019s a risk-free interest rate of the market. If it\u2019s above this diminishable spread between how much we borrow and how much we lend, then I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll work very well. Greg: But isn\u2019t our advantage that we can cherry-pick collateral with high margins. As long as we can offer a percentage point over Libor, we\u2019ll be the highest yield on the market. Sebastien Derivaux: Yes, but also creating more risk. What is the difference between a competitor that can do the same? Circle is offering saving products at 10%. Greg: They can do that by adjusting the risk profile of the investor. Even when you compound, you\u2019re going out on the risk curve. DSR has no liquidity constraints. I think that will be very attractive to some of the larger integrators. Seb: Yeah, sure, but at this point, this will reduce net income. Greg: Yes, but you get a smaller piece of a bigger pie in my perspective. Matthew Rabinowitz: It\u2019s a wonderful problem to have.   LongForWisdom: Alright, so maybe that about wraps up the discussion on that. Lewis just made a point in the sidebar mentioning how gas costs hurt everyone on Ethereum and the use case for DAI for payments and store of value. We need an L2 core unit sooner rather than later.  Open Discussion Descriptive Header 1:04:22  Frank Cruz: Seb, you mentioned you were going to bring something up.  Sebastien Derivaux: We can discuss that a little bit. I had a call with some AAVE investors. I tried to pitch Maker to them, and it was partially successful. They said was that it was too complicated. I replied that AAVE is a marketplace for borrowers and lenders and that Maker doesn\u2019t have lenders. We mint the DAI. They understand that DAI users are not getting fees, but their reaction was that you\u2019re done if you don\u2019t have DAI anymore. If I invest in AAVE, there is always a new token if DAI disappears. This was the first interaction. I tried to tell them they can make a slight margin on AAVE or maybe even none at the moment. This wasn\u2019t a big deal because, in their mind, AAVE is the leader in the money market. If you have a small cut on a bigger market, it\u2019s not a big deal. There\u2019s almost no risk because even if USDC disappears, AAVE will stay. I tried to tell them it doesn\u2019t exactly work like that. It\u2019s easier to duplicate AAVE than Maker because you don\u2019t have to build trust in DAI. Akiva is asking me if AAVE tokens have legal rights over the platform. That\u2019s another question we need to answer. They prefer the marketplace because it\u2019s easier to understand. They don\u2019t have the token risk. I told them that Maker creates money and burns MKR tokens while AAVE is creating AAVE tokens. This is not a very good argument in DeFi. People don\u2019t really care about burning or minting MKR. It will change at some point. The other point they made is that we should use Chainlink oracles. However, we already have some oracles, and the guy said that he doesn\u2019t know how that works. We understand that chaining is public and transparent. I told them the oracle is not an issue. We have customers and even new customers every month. If we are so bad, how is it possible to have new customers every month? One interesting thing was that one of the investors always borrowed USDT on AAVE. I thought, what\u2019s the point of using USDT? His reason was that it\u2019s a good put option because if USDT crashes as he borrowed USDT to borrow something else, there is no risk for him. If it goes down, his loan decreases in value. That was another reason for using AAVE. One of the guys was very interested because he can put some Loopring tokens. After all, we have a vault. AAVE doesn\u2019t have one, and it\u2019s only three percent. On Binance, it cost him two percent per day. That was a good selling point. If you have some questions or comments, I know we need to work a little bit more on marketing and stuff like that.   SamM: I think a good step is to present your presentation. The numbers speak for themselves.  Sebastien Derivaux: I sent them the presentation before, but they didn\u2019t want to speak about it. It couldn\u2019t work because they told me that Chainlink and AAVE are making almost the same amount of money as us. SamM: Chainlink? From what? Price appreciation? Sebastien Derivaux: No, from something else. I never studied Chainlink. Nik: They don\u2019t make anything at all. Wouter: They\u2019re losing money, right? Sebastien Derivaux: It\u2019s not easy to see that if you don\u2019t look in detail. Even for AAVE, there will be some origination fee of 20 bips per loan. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s true or not, but it\u2019s correct that there are 20 bips per origination fee. Suppose you multiply it by the loan originated in the last quarter. In that case, it will be 20 million per year or 20 million per quarter. We are making 60 million. AAVE will probably make the same. SamM: What are they making that from? The loans? Sebastien Derivaux: The origination fee. I don\u2019t know the details because I haven\u2019t studied AAVE as well. For me, they aren\u2019t making anything except flash loans. SamM: Flash loans will be only temporary revenue. They will go to zero as these new tokens come online. Sebastien Derivaux: But what is the plan for AAVE? SamM: I don\u2019t know.   Sebastien Derivaux: We need to understand the competition to discuss it. We need some competitor analysis because I don\u2019t have too much time to see that. Still, everyone is investing and think they are making a lot of money. Someone is wrong, and I hope it\u2019s not us. I\u2019m quite sure it\u2019s not us.  Chris: The entire space can\u2019t use Chainlink oracles, right? Oracles are a system risk. We need a lot of diverse competition in oracles. We don\u2019t want to put all our eggs in one basket. It\u2019s crazy that people think we can go to Chainlink oracles. LongForWisdom: Out of curiosity, he\u2019s using ours with Chainlink as a fallback? Chris: No, I think that was one of the YFI contracts that I looked at.   LongForWisdom: Alright, we\u2019ll wrap up here unless anyone has any other points to make about Maker or our competitors.

My name is Payton, and @prose11 on the Forum. LongForWisdom is on holiday for this week. If you want to ask questions or have comments, please do speak up. Everyone here enjoys answering questions.   Weekly Updates  Governance  LongForWisdom 1:11  Our latest Executive Vote has passed on Monday, which granted seven Core Units their monthly budgets. The Executive also added the remaining Vault types to the Liq 2.0 framework and lowered the tout fee, which is the fee out when using the PSM USDC, from 0.04 to 0.00%. In addition, the vote increased the Global DC by 50 million Dai to help prevent us from reaching the maximum DC.   Polls and Executive  This week, all except one poll had passed, which was the Investigation of the YFI C-type Vault. The winning option was to defer. However, it will still be added to the collateralization frame as dictated in the outcome section. The polls that had passed are:  Parameter Changes Proposal - MakerDAO Open Market Committee  Decrease the UNIV2DAIUSDC-A Liquidation Ratio and Stability Fee, which we will discuss on during this meeting Add P1-DROP as a new RWA Vault Type Add FFT1-DROP as a new RWA Vault Type Add HTC-DROP as a new RWA Vault Type Add CF-DROP as a new RWA Vault Type  Adjusting Auction Parameters for ETH Vault Types, which will be on this week\u2019s Executive  Whitelist Yearn Finance on UNIUSD, LINKUSD, AAVEUSD, COMPUSD Oracles will also be on this week\u2019s Executive     GovAlpha Core Unit update 3:33 GovAlpha Weekly Update  GovAlpha has been busy during the long holiday. Check out our weekly update post on the forums for all the details.   Forum at a Glance  Pablo Buch 4:18 Forum at a Glance for June 4th - 10th  Thanks to @blimpa for setting up and posting this week\u2019s Forum at a Glance. Dai has crossed the 5 billion mark!   Three-Point Summary   Global DC was increased by 500 million Dai. In the same vote, Core Unit Budget Distribution for June was approved; a collective sum of 1,543,127 Dai will be distributed to seven Core Units. USDC-A, USDC-B, TUSD-A, PAXUSD-A, GUSD-A, PSM-USDC-A, UNIV2DAIUSDC-A, USDT-A vault types will be added to the Liquidations 2.0 framework, though liquidations will be disabled.   Announcements  Real-World Finance Core Unit Facilitator @sebventures published the financial report for May 2021.  LongForWisdom on Holiday - 07/06/21 to 14/06/21 - GovAlpha Facilitator @longforwisdom is taking a week off.   Active Discussions   Maker Is Not A Lender; Does Not Take Deposits  An ongoing, deep-reaching discussion set off by @paperimperium.    SourceCred distribution for week ending May 30th, 2021  The weekly report on SourceCred distribution prompted some discussion about the desirability of increasing the minimum payout amount.    Maker and L2: Avoiding Ren\u2019s mistake   @planet_x used Ren as a sobering example of the better mousetrap fallacy and its consequences, which kicked off a discussion on making Maker more user-oriented.     Signal Requests   Offboard unprofitable collateral types   @ultraschuppi poses the question of whether we should offboard collateral types whose Oracles costs outweigh their collected stability fees.    Adjusting ttl on flap-auctions   @ultraschuppi argues for decreasing the ttl parameter (bid duration).     Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 06:00  In regards to schedule, this week will involve Rate Group changes and the stuff Payton mentioned. Next week we\u2019re planning to do the Centrifuge assets. They will be on Kovan on Friday, which may be pushed back because they are in the middle of an audit, and some of the DC increases were beyond the scope of what we had originally recommended. They will be set until the second audit. We may not be going to do RWA next week. On the collateral onboarding side, we had to make changes to the DSSProxy actions to support the Sushi LP tokens and PAX-G adapter. This requires some UI changes. We have also been working on the SushiJoin adapter, stalled until the Masterchef v2 gets updated. For modules, there have been many discussions and code clean-up around the DSSVest, which is how we will be distributing MKR and paying teams DAI. We talked about the D3M direct deposit module for Aave. We began thinking about different test cases like emergency shutdown and more. Vote delegation is completed; it is currently passing its RPC tests, and ABDK finished the audit. We may end up having much Governance action here. Governance may have questions around this, but there are no core changes to the protocol. There\u2019s a flash DSSMint module which is flash minting Dai. We\u2019re finalizing some code changes and aligning the best practices there. We\u2019ve been helping a lot on the auction demo keeper, which is a backstop keeper for liquidations. We put some work in the clipperCallee to support LP tokens there. If anyone wants to run that, you can grab that keeper, and it should have LP token support. We will try to keep it up to date as we add different collateral types like SushiJoin. It\u2019s easy to run; you need a private key and some ETH to start and run all the authorizations. There will be some implementation change to the clipper; The attack function will be added to the SushiJoin adapter to collect rewards, which won\u2019t change interfaces. We\u2019ve been transferring the auditor, tooling, and legal agreements from the foundation to the DAO. I want to remind everyone that Protocol Engineering has office hours every Tuesday at 3:00 PM UTC Also, we\u2019ve been talking about staked ETH and evaluating the implications; what it means to MakerDAO. @hexonaut has been looking at the UniV3 fixed spread token that can get the standard equivalent of LP tokens on a fixed spread for like-kind of assets with Uniswap. that way, we can create a Vault that possibly sucks some of the stuff such as USDC from the PSM. The idea is that people will naturally create Vaults. There may be an angle where we can this kind of stuff in place of the collateral backing of the PSM, which is attractive from a security perspective because the backlist risk would be one step remote in this more generic token that many more members would be participating in.  Derek: I will clarify a little bit about the fixed spread UniV3. It\u2019s still in the investigative phase, but the idea is to roll out this starting with DAI-USDC at some fixed spread just around $1. we could potentially offer this with high leverage because it\u2019s not much different than the current USDC Vault besides the fact that it would be a regular Vault. It\u2019s no longer on Maker\u2019s book. As Chris mentioned, we get the blacklist risk bonus as well, as we can start charging interest for this mountain of USDC we\u2019ve on our books right now.   Christopher Mooney: I forgot to mention a lot is going on L2 work that is going on. We are constantly in touch with L2 providers in the space.   Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 14:27  Earlier this week, we moved the Oracle Core Unit to MIPs into formal submission, which will be included in the June Governance Cycle. There was a lot of work going on behind the scenes. We had a bunch of polls this week related to whitelisting for yEarn Vaults. All those passed and will be going to the Executive vote tomorrow. All of those are for newly delegated Vaults that yEarn is doing. I will begin submitting the MIP to delegate a lot of authority for nondangerous oracle functions to the Oracle Core Unit; for example, The whitelisting function can have no harm to the protocol; this will help us prevent long delays from the Governance Executive votes and improve onboarding by preventing spam votes in the Governance. We\u2019ve been talking a lot about staked ETH, and there is a lot of interest coming in. eventually, all ETH will become staked ETH at some point. Right now, there is just liquidity. There is no direct redeemability, but this feature will come up soon to redeem staked ETH. We\u2019re pushing and prioritizing it. We looked into this in the past, but the Oracle Team blocked this because creating a staked ETH oracle is difficult to safely create due to all the liquidity exclusively in Curve with very little volume in other platforms. Exploits like flash loans might manipulate the prices, but there are some workarounds around this. We\u2019re working with the Lido team to figure this out, but we should find a way to create our oracle. A signaling poll passed this week to change the DAI-USDC LP parameters by lowering the SF to 0.5% and CR to 101%. The lowest we can do is 102% because the LP token oracles math is based on approximations. There are things that we did to optimize the gas which doesn\u2019t compute precisely. Lastly, if you compare the oracle price to the real price, the drift is not that bad. in extreme cases, the delta may go up to 1%, making Dai minting profitable and dangerous.  Christopher Mooney: We\u2019re going to leave liquidations off as we had discussed with the mandated actors. We want to get a better set of liquidation parameters. Brian McMichael: An idea on the instant access module is that we can work together to develop technical implementation by the time you put up your MIP. Nick: Sure!     Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 26:32  Regarding collateral evaluations, we\u2019re finishing the last two evaluations for Sushi which would be SUSHI-ETH, SUSHI-LP pair, and xSUSHI. This will be posted within the following days. We started discussing the next potential implementations or collateral onboarding between other facilitators. We\u2019re likely to focus on three major implementations and evaluations, which will keep us busy the next few weeks. We will be starting with staked ETH collateral onboarding, D3M model implementation, and Polygon collateral onboarding. These three could lead to a more meaningful Dai supply. Staked ETH and D3M could be more demanding right now where we need to evaluate Aave protocol risk instead of just collateral risk. We\u2019re adding more metrics to the risk dashboard. We should soon have the auction statistics page live. Also, we\u2019re making simulators where community members can simulate losses for Maker loans based on the parameters picked. Parallelly, we\u2019re building a separate page to put all the recommendations, research, and evaluations based on segments. This will be helpful for the community and future analysts.   Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 30:18  There are not many updates this week. I recently came to know that I am discussed to be removed from the organization. To clarify, I work for Maker with 100% dedication and do not involve any politics. I would appreciate constructive feedback on this.  Payton: LongForWisdom will be back next week. If there is any Governance-related information, he will help you out.     Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia 35:02 Growth CU Weekly Updates  We are in Miami! We had a lot of meetings, and one of them was with Aave Pro. We tried to understand what it takes to have an institutional product. I suggest everyone read the forum post to explain institutional Vaults and the opportunities available. In the case of Aave, it\u2019s easier because they need to create a separate pool that they are using for the institutions. They are including USDC, ETH, BTC, and AAVE. We\u2019re also trying to integrate here but are planning to have permission DAI, which would be possible after the D3M module. We also spoke to Celcius. They have a similar thing in mind but want their CEL token integrated as collateral in Maker. We\u2019re aware of the costs for incorporating new collateral, and of course, we check different things like understanding the users of those Vaults. We should start thinking about shutting down old collateral types that are not working and preparing the questionnaire before onboarding new collaterals. Opera integrated Dai in their beta android app, which is famous in emerging markets like Nigeria. We\u2019re in touch with them to understand if they can integrate Optimism DAI. We are also talking with BlockFi, but more details are coming soon on that. Dai was listed in Bithumb in Korea. Dai is the first stable coin there, and the hardware wallet listed Dai. We see a lot more adoption of DAI in Klaytn among other networks.  @Lozadauis12 organized a tournament with Axie in Latin. it\u2019s very interesting. please participate. Next week, we will have this tournament streaming live on Twitch and YouTube which will help Dai to be named on these popular sites.  Christopher Mooney: Did we reach out to someone in El Salvador to see if there are any opportunities that we can leverage on BTC and Dai Vaults? BTC and USD are legal tender there. Nadia: Surprisingly, they were not much into crypto. We\u2019re trying to reach out to crypto ATMs there.     Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling  Juan Guill\u00e9n 43:18  1456\u00d7346 168 KB   1114\u00d7821 229 KB   1115\u00d7708 198 KB   1091\u00d7740 204 KB   1264\u00d7755 115 KB   1239\u00d7748 100 KB   Questions  Mariano: What is allowing to onboard service providers into the ecosystem?  Wouter: We are using a model that we are developing to get service providers onboarded into the ecosystem. Any service that may be provided through the DAO, such as a company that does e-mail marketing campaigns, which is a service provider, can be reached out to. We then explain how to work with the DAO protocol. This is difficult because these companies are used to working with centralized organizations through traditional methods. We help understand these differences and assist them in creating a business unit inside their organization that can ultimately put up their MIP to provide their service through a better-integrated business model between that company and the DAO. Part of these methods is the Incubator program, which is up and running. We will continue to document more on this.     Content Production Core Unit Update  Seth Goldfarb 51:20 Content Production Core Unit Biweekly Update for May 27th - June 9th  This week\u2019s primary focus revolved around hiring. We\u2019re looking for a couple of writers and a video producer. Juan, Andrew, and others have sent us some candidates. We will begin interviewing and hopefully begin onboarding some people soon. The vote on the mascot has ended with a tie between the capybara and dragon. The best solution for this is to host an art contest and get feedback from the community. We are scheduling a planning session next week by reaching out to people interested in this.   MIPs Update  David Utrobin 53:16 Weekly MIPs Update  1048\u00d7583 74.3 KB   1047\u00d7584 85.1 KB   1045\u00d7584 240 KB   1047\u00d7585 50.1 KB   1047\u00d7583 107 KB   1045\u00d7584 142 KB   1044\u00d7581 182 KB   1046\u00d7582 185 KB   1043\u00d7581 174 KB   1046\u00d7582 134 KB   1043\u00d7583 71.4 KB   1046\u00d7583 109 KB   Questions  Juan Guill\u00e9n: David, did you purposely miss the GovAlpha budget modification proposed MIP? David Utrobin: Sorry, I did not realize I had missed it. I will go over it now:  We saw a budget modification posted on the forum by @Deimos. This is an interesting case because it is the first time a non-MakerDAO team member has posted a budget modification on behalf of another Core Unit. He posted a modification for GovAlpha stating the team should get MKR compensation. We spoke about this during the internal Gov Domain chat channel. I was not sure how to initially respond to this; assign an SP number or move forward in another way? Ultimately, I gave my recommendations and helped it move forward by proposing that this budget modification should come from a member of that CU itself. When somebody from outside proposes, a person from the CU team should clear it with a MIP editor. However, I am open to ideas. The author of the proposal is very nice and openly allowing GovAlpha to take over from here. Payton Rose: This wouldn\u2019t relate to all budget modifications because if you want to defund a CU, the CU itself won\u2019t propose that, of course.     Formal Submission Review  Payton Rose 1:06:31  LongForWisdom will return Sunday evening and will add things into the voting portal for relevant MIPs. Currently, we have gone over all of the publications. The nine MIPs which David has presented are good to go and will appear on the ratification polls. LongForWisdom will still be the final reviewer and help maintain our standard workflow.   UNIV2DAIUSDC-A Changes  Payton Rose 1:07:13  There was a small typo in the section going over the copy of different options. Luckily, on the vote itself, all the options appeared correct. It is clear that the community preferred to lower the LR for UNIV2DAIUSDC-A. This was a ranked choice vote, and the vote to decrease LR to 101%, SF, was overwhelmingly the winning vote by the long run. We understand that there may be community intention to drop to a much lower LR. However, with Nik\u2019s comment in mind from Oracle\u2019s side, it is appropriate to put it in this week\u2019s Executive as 102% LR rather than 101% stated by the winning option. Risk perspective does advise changing some of the ilk parameters for how much we\u2019re allowing into liquidations at once. If we were to flip the liquidation switch on, it would take some time to discuss and execute. Sam, @hexonaut posted in the chat that he is the author of the signal that led to this vote. He believes we should push it down to 101% if it\u2019s okay with the mandated actors.  Hexonaut?: It\u2019s in line with what we have been doing; Governance signals, intent, and mandated actors. We can take a lighter or measured approach if need be.   Payton: The plan for tomorrow is for the copy to drop to 102% rather than 101%. As Nik mentioned, we can make a further signal to push it down to 101%. We will also have to get liquidations figured out.   Anonymous Question Box 1:10:43 Suggestion Box  This week\u2019s question is: What price differences need to occur to get liquidated on a 102% ratio compared to the previous ratio of about 105%?  Wouter: Based on the leverage levels, it\u2019s not that much of a difference. Payton Rose: Yes, it\u2019s not that much, but these are stablecoin pairs, so in theory, neither Dai nor USDC should diverge too far from their Peg. We do still have the base oracles at 1. It\u2019s more in terms of the concern coming from the SF; if the pool itself is not earning more than the SF, that will push items over into liquidation. Also, the transfer to v3 is looking to be the case for this, resulting in positions being undercollateralized. Therefore, dropping this by 0.5% does help mitigate that as well. Nik Kunkel: Dai and USDC are hard pegged to 1 in the protocol. The LP token is only increasing due to trading fees generated. It is only the SF that can put you in the liquidation range. Nik Kunkel: This is an interesting point that is more theoretical than practical, but if Dai or USDC is hard de-pegged and we had too much impermanent loss, it drops below the fees generated by the pool is highly unlikely but theoretically can happen. Payton: We will have much larger problems if that were to occur.

MIP21 going into Kovan the following week and executive following Friday. Team will focus on MIP 14, MIP MIP 25, MIP 30 next. End of 2020 was pretty aggressive and the team lost some smart contract engineers. Will need to pace and train up more people to have 4 collateral types a month, 1  MIP, and a set of community initiatives. Sam is working on the UI for PSM.

This is the first meeting of the year. I hope everyone enjoyed themselves in their time off. My name is LongForWisdom. I am the governance facilitator for MakerDAO, and I will be moderating this meeting. We have got an agenda as usual, which I will go through briefly before we begin. We have got a few new people around, so feel free to interrupt or comment if you have things to say. We love to hear from everyone; if it becomes a problem, someone will let you know. Please do err on the side of speaking if you have anything to say. We\u2019ve got weekly updates from the main domains and groups\u2019. We\u2019ve got the MIPs submission review. We\u2019ve got segments that a  couple of people are talking about. We\u2019re going to have Primoz talking about risk and the bull markets. Nick\u2019s going to bring up concerns regarding flap auctions and the surplus buffer. I\u2019m hoping Sam or Hexonauts will give us an update on the PSM usage. To start with, though, I think we\u2019ll dive into Governance. I\u2019ll give a brief update on the stuff that\u2019s already happened this week. On Monday, we saw that the ETH-A debt ceiling got hit along with the USDC-A debt ceiling. As a result, Sam and Seb worked on an executive vote and proposal to increase the ceilings to avoid delaying too much. This went up on Monday and has passed, which is good. We saw the ceilings updates earlier this morning. We usually have me going through Governance at a Glance. Today, however, we\u2019re going to have a Prose11 go through it, and possibly in the future as well. Prose11 is a new member. I\u2019m assuming most people have seen him around, but if not, Prose11 feel free to introduce yourself and kick it off.  Prose11: Thanks for letting me do this. I\u2019m Prose11, both on the forums and RocketChat. I am a new member but diving into and loving the Maker community. Let\u2019s walk through Governance at a Glance. Prose11: A three-point summary for the MKR holders is that PSM is live, and we did see some pretty big activity using it this week. That did result in some DAI price fluctuations. We\u2019re still looking at the peg between $0.997 and $1.09. I expect as we expand, it will be looking even better. Meanwhile, DAI supply hit a new all-time high. When I wrote it, it was at 1.34 billion; now it\u2019s even higher, so people are using the extra room in the ETH vaults there for sure. Also, MKR mooned this week, which was exciting\u2014peaking well past $1,000. I think it peaked at around $1,250. Pretty exciting for those MKR holders out there. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.     Weekly Updates Prose11 Governance at a Glance 02:38 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you can read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated. Discussions   2021 mission and objectives  SebVentures builds off the prior brainstorming post and asks community members to vote on where they think MakerDAO should be focused. Prose11: SebVentures posted a poll about the mission or the vision of MakerDAO, following up on a brainstorming post he had made earlier when asking the community to weigh in on where they think we should be focused for 2021.    Maker Stability Module, inspired by Aave and Synthetix  Ratchet5000 details a new idea for generating yield for MKR holders by allowing them to stake MKR on the Maker Platform. Prose11: We have a cool post about the Maker Stability Module. This is an idea allowing for more yield to MKR holders through the Maker platform.    USDT has always been shady, but now they might be closer to a collapse than anytime before, yet it was added as collateral?  BlueCat points to a regulatory requirement upcoming next week for USDT and questions its safety as a collateral type. Prose11: We have a post about USDT and some regulatory hurdles they\u2019ll be facing next week via BlueCat. Check that out if you haven\u2019t.    Road to the PSM  Hexonaut\u2019s post on the PSM heats back up thanks to implementation and the recent rising of the DC. Prose11: Hexonaut\u2019s post on the Road to PSM has seen some increased traffic now that we\u2019ve implemented it and went through our first DC raise. He will update us during this call.    Signal Requests   Adjust the Surplus Buffer\\  Ultraschuppi proposes different ways to increase Surplus Buffer. Prose11: We have an adjust the surplus buffer signal request. We are currently sitting at 4 million, and asking whether we would like to raise that.    Adjust ETH-B line (IAM-Ceiling)  Ultraschuppi puts forward some options for expanding the IAM Ceiling on ETH-B. Prose11: Next, we\u2019ve got a signal, again, from Ultraschuppi with the ETH-B line. We are looking at that IAM-Ceiling. That\u2019s the one we can adjust ourselves, setting the highest level and seeing if we\u2019d like to raise that since ETH-B is maxed out again.    Manage TUSD exposure due to ownership change  SebVentures signals different options for dealing with the protocol\u2019s TUSD exposure after an extensive discussion in the forums. Prose11: SebVentures also brought us a signal request on managing TUSD exposure. I had a lot of talk about that with them changing hands in the forum and what we\u2019d like our response to be. Give your opinion there if you haven\u2019t already.    Adjust UNIV2DAIETH-A Debt Ceiling  ultraschuppi proposes an increase to the UNIV2DAIETH-A Debt Ceiling. Prose11: This is the final request regards adjusting the DAI-ETH liquidity token vault. We\u2019ve already hit the DC there, so this signal request is seeing if we\u2019d like to raise it.   Prose11: As I said, I would like to give it to hexonaut to explain his signal request for the interim DAO operating budget. It\u2019s new and exciting and just went live yesterday.  SamM: Thanks, Prose11. Basically, for those who don\u2019t know, we\u2019ve been building out the Autonomous MakerDAO operation to move away from the Foundation as the sole provider for building stuff and operating the Maker protocol. For the most part, the Foundation has been covering this through the grants program, but there are increased costs associated with things that the Foundation can\u2019t be involved with. Specifically, the PSM is the primary example of that. We\u2019ve been racking up costs that need to be covered. That, along with the fact that we need to move toward the DAO itself funding things in general. We figured that the next step for that is to get an initial budget. We\u2019re proposing 100,000 DAI as an initial budget to go into a multi-sig wallet controlled by all the mandated facilitators. The signal request will be up for two weeks, and the plan is to put that to a governance vote at the beginning of February because, at that time, we will know who all the facilitators are. There are currently three going through the monthly governance cycle. This will go forward if we can get at least three facilitators signed on and then slowly move away from the Foundation. LongForWisdom: To clarify one thing there, Sam. Typically, the keyholders would be those mandated actors in the Foundation, correct? SamM: Yes, it\u2019s everybody I listed in the thread. It\u2019s not all facilitators, but it\u2019s the ones in the thread; you can read it for yourself.   Prose11: Awesome. Very cool. This is my first time doing the Governance at a Glance, so go to the forums if you have any feedback, comments, or ideas. That\u2019s pretty much it from my end. Thanks for letting me do the shout outs. LongForWisdom: Yes, thank you very much, Prose. That was awesome. There was one last thing I wanted to say concerning the Governance front, which is that there\u2019s probably going to be several polls on Monday. I think, possibly nine or ten. Look out for those next Monday. Specifically, a couple of signals, inclusion polls for January, and a couple of others with oracle stuff as well. All right, I think that covers Governance for the time being.  Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 10:02  Happy New Year, everybody, also welcome, Prose. That\u2019s great. It brings a tear to my eye to watch the DAO growing up, starting to stand on its own. It\u2019s a very, very exciting time. Usually, I go over last week\u2019s stuff, but I guess I\u2019ll go over last year\u2019s things. In December, on the 18th, we passed the UNI V2 DAI-F and AAVE collateral type. We adjusted some rates. We also whitelisted Gnosis in general into the oracles. Then the community passed the PSM for USDCA on the 20th. Or at least that\u2019s when the executive went live. We did DC changes for ETH-A, USDCA, and the PSM USDCA on the fourth of this week. As for everything else, there are pretty much no other reports from last year. I think we\u2019re just going to talk about where we\u2019re headed. Hopefully, in the coming week, we should get MIP21 in Kovan, either this Friday or early next week, depending on how things go. For those of you that need a refresher, that\u2019s the real-world assets for 6S. We should be expecting that next Friday. That\u2019s exciting because that\u2019ll be the first Real World Asset use case on the platform. We\u2019re still looking at the Dss.exec lib changes. We\u2019re hoping to make those updates before getting ramped up on collateral onboarding because it\u2019ll radically simplify collateral onboarding. We have some domain teamwork that still needs to be reviewed. MIP14, which is the DAI protocol transfer, should probably get on that one pretty soon to make sure it stable since it sounds like you guys might be using that to fund some action. Then MIP17, MIP25, and MIP30 still need updates. Actually, sorry, MIP17 was the debt ceiling. I think we\u2019re okay because we went with the DC instant access module. So really, we need to look at the flash mint and the Farmable cUSD adapter, the CropJoin. The end of last year was aggressive; a lot of people got pretty burnt out. And over the tail end of last year, our community lost some smart contract engineers and the Foundation because of various other market opportunities. We were hoping to pace ourselves a little bit better; we\u2019re down to bare bones on expertise for the system. Therefore we\u2019re hoping that we could rate limit until we get some more people trained up to around four collateral additions a month and one MIP a month. We\u2019re hoping to take one of those weeks and make it a community week. That would be any time changes that might need to be made to the PSM; Any changes at all. We would slide anything the Foundation can\u2019t touch into that week. Also, the community would run its executive. Meanwhile, we\u2019d be able to work a little bit more on that tooling and trying to get stuff a little bit more efficient. That\u2019s our hope and expectation for this coming year until we can ramp up on more people. There was a discussion yesterday as the MKR price was going up. Long was thinking should we have our eyes on governance attacks? And that got me thinking about precisely what governance attack to do. And we have a governance attack vector that would not be great. Specifically, anyone that took control of Governance right now could instantaneously turn on liquidations for stablecoins, and we think that there\u2019s no need to do that. We don\u2019t need to have those things instantaneously accessible. We know that stablecoins don\u2019t have liquidations on; we don\u2019t plan on turning them on. There\u2019s very little reason to have them come on in a hot emergency. I think that what we should do is remove all of the stablecoin vaults from the instant access module to turn liquidations on and off. And if we do that, that\u2019ll reduce the attack surface of governance attack. I\u2019ll try and make a forum post about that to throw it out there. But I think you could expect that in the coming weeks executive. We\u2019ll likely do that then. With regards to the PSM, I just wanted to make a general comment. I think Sam is working on a UI for the PSM to make it more accessible to everybody. But, if the PSM were under the Foundation\u2019s control, we would still have a product manager pushing this forward. Because really, what\u2019s happened is we\u2019ve added the PSM, and it\u2019s at the database layer. It needs documentation so that people know how to integrate with it. It requires a UI so that it\u2019s more accessible to people. If we were to end up doing this, the community should think about not just the fact that we got the PSM out there, but think about the chain of everything that still needs to happen. Other stablecoins would need to be added to it. And the old stablecoins would probably need to be liquidated into it. There\u2019s still a lot of work there. I\u2019m very proud that the community was able to have that autonomy and do their own thing. But remember, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do. And so, if anyone wants to take the lead on pushing that forward, I\u2019m just giving you some general ideas of how we would have done it in the Foundation if we were in control of something like that. Finally, I think we could probably talk about this later because you guys will bring it up. I think Nick was going to speak about flap auctions and whatnot. But I\u2019ve got a couple of comments to make on the flap auctions risk and the flip auctions. I\u2019m going to defer, and we\u2019ll do the other domain updates. And I\u2019ll come back to this when we\u2019re talking about those topics.  Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 17:29  At the tail end of last year, we onboarded the DAI-ETH Uniswap LP token. We had set the three million debt ceiling fairly conservatively because we were not entirely confident in the contracts\u2019 security because it was brand new. The debt ceiling for that got filled up extremely quickly. That validated our thesis that there is a lot of demand for leveraging up on LP yields. Given that we\u2019ve proven that LP tokens should be a core focus of collateral onboarding going forward. And there is a lot of potential for stability fee generation there. Especially the risk front as well. It means that you can have LP pairs against stablecoins, which are less volatile than ETH. That means that they\u2019re almost by definition less risky than ETH from a price perspective. It also means that the system doesn\u2019t have to hold all those stablecoins as well. We hold them through Uniswap, so the blacklisting risk is a little bit lower there, as well. There was also a forum post over the holidays saying the debt ceiling\u2019s full. Let\u2019s raise the debt ceiling. I disagree with that. But not for the reason you\u2019d think. I think the fact that we\u2019ve gotten through the holidays unscathed on that Oracle is a sign that we can increase our confidence slightly, but it\u2019s not a ringing endorsement. Therefore we need to get a formal audit from a reputable auditing firm. Not something like QuantStamp. Something really good like a Trail of Bits, an EY, a PwC or a DappHub, or something. Until we have that, I don\u2019t feel comfortable starting to raise the debt ceilings by large amounts. It looks like there was one option to raise the debt ceiling of DAI-ETH to 10 million. That seemed to be the polling option that was getting the most traction, or maybe it was 12. I think it was 10. But instead, what I want to suggest is that we optimize for this medium-term picture where as soon as we get the audit back, and everything checks out. We can crank up the dial on these. What we don\u2019t want to be is in a position where, after we got the audit back, we need to go and onboard all these LP tokens. It would be great to keep the debt ceilings depressed for now, but just start onboarding more LP tokens. When the audits come back, we just crank up the dial while being in a great spot. That being said, there\u2019s already a polling vote that passed to onboard USDC-ETH. That will be coming up in an executive on the 22nd. And in the interim, there will also be a polling vote for WBTC-ETH. Therefore, potentially, we could be onboarding both LP tokens on the executive on the 22nd. Those would be the three largest Uniswap token pools from the last time I checked. Where do we go from here? Well, we get Sushiswap LP tokens for free. And I don\u2019t know if you guys have been keeping track, but the liquidity in Sushiswap is starting to get enormous. Also, since SushiSwap and Uniswap are just the same contracts, we get those for free without making any changes. Therefore we can start looking at Sushiswap LP tokens. We can start looking at The Curve LP tokens. We can start looking at Balancer LP tokens, maybe even 1INCH ones, if they start keeping serious volume after their 1INCH farming stuff expires. That\u2019s on the LP token side. That looks like everything is trending in the right direction, as we expected. That\u2019s good. In terms of governance updates, we have ten whitelisting proposals that will go up next week. There are five for Gnosis and five for SetProtocol. Those are both feeds in our Oracle network, and they\u2019re dogfooding practice what you preach. That\u2019s good to see.  LongForWisdom: A quick governance note on that. We\u2019re probably going to bundle those polls. The Oracle whitelisting proposals for Gnosis and SetProtocol, just because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a lot of contention around them. I think it can make some sense to whitelist the groups together, whitelist the Gnosis ones and whitelist the SetProtocol ones. We\u2019re going to do that, and hopefully, no one\u2019s going to complain. Nick: There are also 17 pending Oracle whitelisting proposals from DYDX for basically creating Starkware L2 Oracle\u2019s for them for their upcoming release. If you add those two together, that\u2019s 27 total pending Oracle requests. I think we\u2019re finally starting to hit our stride with respect to Oracle\u2019s as a business that the DAO owns and can earn revenue from in the future. So I think that\u2019s all exciting. BrianMcMiachel: If I can jump in here real quick. I did come on to the forums and pumped the brakes myself a little bit on the LP Oracle debt ceiling raise. I just want to mention that we did some additional testing on the smart contract side this week, and a lot of our concerns are assuaged. But I do want to second Nick\u2019s desire for an audit there. But as far as adding new tokens. Let\u2019s go ahead and do that. The other thing is, I think somebody else will probably mention our current surplus buffer. If we were to raise that surplus buffer, I don\u2019t think we would have a problem necessarily raising the debt ceiling on the LP tokens to be just short of that. I think that\u2019s our limiter at 3 million right now. We\u2019ve got a 4 million DAI surplus buffer. Raising the one would allow us to more comfortably raise the other. I am just throwing that out there. LongForWisdom: Yeah, thank you, Brian, and Nick. And, Nick, can I ask if there\u2019s been any progress with the Centrifuge Oracle report? Nick: I just started it this week. I\u2019ve been very clear that we were swamped up to the tail end of last year and that it would be my priority coming back. So I\u2019ve been working on that and should be out probably before the end of next week.    Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 26:25  Regarding collateral evaluations in the last few weeks, our two externals analysts finished tBTC evaluations during the holidays. It actually may happen that this may be the first collateral that we red light to onboarding it. I won\u2019t go into full details now about the reason, but there are all sorts of liquidity problems and an outstanding tBTC. The evaluations show that we would like to probably onboard it with less than a 1 million debt ceiling. We said we might evaluate it later when metrics approve and onboard it afterward. This evaluation should be online soon. We promised another one is the cUSDC CropJoin, so MIP30 so the risk assessment when we came to a point to study the risk parameters or propose them. Compound recently released this new patch. This patch lets Governance more actively decide how comp rewards would be distributed for particular markets. This makes our job a bit harder because when we decide on stability fees for cUSD, this would typically be a function of farming yield. Still, because of this implementation, the compound farming yield could be adjusted by the Governance easily. It would need to react by potentially setting a different stability fee. So that is why we are still figuring out how this would work in practice. Is there any hidden risk, and we will release details about it in the report? Monet-supply from our team should make a signal request thread soon about potentially increasing dust amount again. The recent increase in ETH price increased gas prices significantly, and this presents a problem, of course, during collateral events when people want the leverage and the costs are too high. There\u2019s an additional problem if you have liquidations. There may not be bidding on small vaults. The current value is 500 DAI, but yes, unfortunately, we may need to increase it. Stay tuned for this signal, and please vote. Another thing that our new member Andy has been working on is refreshing our Maker portfolio value at risk(VaR) model. We haven\u2019t updated that one for some time, but that was mostly because we were more focused on measuring expected loss for individual vaults. This helps us define risk premium and which we later use in the rate setting group. Now, when maker debt exposure is growing fast, we may want to have a clearer picture of the overall Maker portfolio\u2019s tail losses. In other words, we want to measure portfolio evaluated risk correctly, which means we need to include correlation metrics and to measure worse case events and so on. I think this is great is because it should also help us more appropriately define surplus buffer or help us mitigate risk in different ways if we see that our exposure is becoming too risky. I think Andy will show us some numbers soon. This will also be beneficial, especially now because we have this surplus buffer topic and, you know, talking about risk mitigation during this bull run. Lastly, yesterday rates group released the rates proposal, so please check that report and provide feedback. Just a short sum-up of the report, we\u2019re proposing a great increase for both ETH vaults and a slight decrease for BTC vaults. A few rate decreases for vaults where either liquidity metrics improved or depth exposure decreased. The decision is mostly based on a competitive market environment. We also consider risk metrics and the recently increased usage of ETH vaults then we have a real-world side of risk, and I\u2019ll let Sebastian update it here. Before that, if anybody has any questions, please ask. Sebastien Derivaux: I\u2019ll take it from here. From the real world assets side, we made some due diligence progress on New Silver and ConsolFreight, checking that the legal documents are similar to what we have discussed with both asset originators. We still don\u2019t have a legal team on Maker, so we check the document, not lawyers. Maybe Marvin will be able to help with that. I will have to check with Amy. For 6S, we are waiting on the contract. I\u2019m quite sure Matthew is quite busy setting up the infrastructure in the real world. We are already working on some new collaterals or at least doing the first pass on new collaterals, which our discussion community called yesterday. Lastly, we are working on some documentation to make some concepts easier to understand. Sometimes, it was a bit experimental. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  LongForWisdom: Any questions? I\u2019d love to see some more documentation that helps explain some of the concepts you guys are dealing with. Sebastien Derivaux: It\u2019s quite complicated, and we are trying to build the concept from the ground up and try to make something generalized that can work for any real-world asset, so it\u2019s a bit complicated.    Amy Jung Operational Support Update 33:27  Hey, everybody. 2021 no doubt, is a big year for the DAO operationally. This quarter, we\u2019ve already seen a brand new pace of activity and the community taking action towards a truly self-sustaining DAO in terms of operational support. A big point that I wanted to highlight was around this discussion about increasing the surplus buffer for DAO expenses. I\u2019ll summarize a little bit of the activity happening in the forum already to support that statement of increasing. First, we have the interim funding that Sam has proposed, as well as there is a technical MIP for the KEG to do actual payouts as well that Sam is working on. And then, with Sam\u2019s interim funding, he did mention a multi-sig, and that process, a non-technical MIP, will be coming soon from Prose. SebVentures also submitted a team, precisely Real-World Assets, funding experiment. It highlights what it would look like to be funding a team and what some of the expectations might be. All this is happening now while a more formal domain team funding structure is coming. One main point that I would love to highlight is Juan is in formal submission for his operational support facilitator role. I would highly encourage you to vote on that when the time comes, as he\u2019s been instrumental in supporting a lot of what\u2019s happening on the operational side.  Community Development Team Update  Then for community development. During the break, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how information moves and surfaces in our community. A big piece of that outcome is I\u2019ve been working with Anna, who does our snippets, and David from our community in rolling out a master resource list of projects and teams in the Maker community. There\u2019s a lot. It\u2019s over 60, I believe. This will give an overview of everything that has been happening and everything that is still happening. This list includes working groups and things like that. And one of the things I would also encourage is how we\u2019re thinking about making this useful and maintainable. One of the things that I often see in projects like this is people tend not to update it, and we don\u2019t know the status. Therefore, we\u2019re working on making it simple where anyone could contribute to it. So that\u2019s it for us. Any questions?  Questions  David Utrobin: I have a quick question about the distribution of the budgets to different teams and the evolution of that at Maker. In October, I know Long posted a thread called Flapper Distributor that proposed a mechanism for doing that. And I know Seb also posted a MIP proposal for something called the Strategic Reserves Fund. And now, this week, we saw a temporary multi-sig happening. Specifically, I was curious about the Flapper distributor. Is there any plan to formalize the spec and bring it into a MIP and solidify the whole vision for distributing funds from the surplus buffer to more specialized instruments?  SamM: I can speak to that. The Flapper Distributor is the KEG. The KEG is meant to be the implementation for the description of the Flapper distributor. David: Okay, got it. Got it. Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. Thank you. LongForWisdom: I think we had the KEG developed separately. And it was always the same as the distributor, which was relatively easy to combine the functionality. David: So the Keg is documented where exactly? Is it in its own MIP? Or is it part of it? Yeah, I\u2019m just curious where I could read more about it. Christopher: The Keg started as a hackathon project and the Foundation a while back? I guess we can find that code. But maybe Sam knows more. He\u2019s working on it right now. SamM: So Lucas and myself have been working on that since the hackathon project. It\u2019s since been adjusted to include the Flapper distributor. The Keg itself has two pieces of functionality. It makes streaming payments, both from the Flapper and just fixed-rate amounts that can come out of the surplus buffer. So it\u2019s just a general-purpose tool we can use to pull funding for whatever. David: Got it. Super exciting. Yeah, thanks for the update. SamM: Oh, yeah. And with the MIP, I\u2019m working on the MIP for that.    Juan Collateral Call Update 39:02  Yesterday, we had a call, the first one of the year with Real-World Assets. We had Peoples Company; It\u2019s quite exciting and mainly concerns farming. You can check it out. It\u2019s already on YouTube while Pablo works on the notes, which should be up soon. Next week, we\u2019ll have the xDAI team. Igor and Andrew from the xDAI team will be here explaining a bit more about how it works and discuss their application for the stake. As a special guest, we\u2019ll have Patricio from Pope the proof of attendance protocol. They will be explaining how they migrated to xDAI, different advantages of L2, etc. So we\u2019ll see how that goes. So that\u2019s it regarding the calls. I wanted to echo a bit on what Chris has been saying about burnout. I think it\u2019s a bit also about managing expectations. Different partners and different projects want to interact with Maker, so we need to realize how much effort is being put by the smart contract teams, risk, and Oracle\u2019s mainly to get these things done evaluated and make sure that everything is safe. So it\u2019s about communicating a bit better. The effort that this takes and making sure that we don\u2019t disappoint anyone. Again, if we managed to communicate better all the effort and everything required from our side, it\u2019s not just a plug and play. We can make sure that no one is disappointed at the end and that we can grow at a pace that we\u2019re comfortable with. Those are my two cents. I don\u2019t know if there are any questions, I guess not. Amy, Nick, and Primoz covered pretty much everything.  David Utrobin MIPs Update 41:34 Weekly MIPs Update #23 808\u00d7449 69.2 KB  David: I have the pleasure of doing the MIPs Update this week. I prepared a few slides to make it a little easier to follow along. First of all, happy new year to everybody. I should introduce myself; my name is David Utrobin. I\u2019m one of the community development leads at the Maker Foundation. I\u2019m also a MIP editor in training, so I\u2019ve been working with Charles over the last couple of months and getting my feet wet with MIPs. We are entering our first governance cycle for 2021, which is the January governance cycle. The first week is dedicated to formal submissions. I think formal submission officially closes tomorrow on Friday. Still, I\u2019m glad to announce that all of the MIP and sub proposal authors that said they would formally submit their MIPs have already done so. To give a reminder; after a MIP or sub proposal is formally submitted the governance facilitator does the submission review. Inclusion polls happen the following Monday, which is going to be this coming Monday, January 11th. You will be able to, as an MKR holder, vote whether these should be included in the governance poll and the executive vote, which is a bundled version of all of these MIPs and some proposals.  1274\u00d7706 180 KB 1306\u00d7725 109 KB 806\u00d7444 53.9 KB 1304\u00d7722 53.6 KB 811\u00d7449 43.5 KB 809\u00d7448 80.3 KB 806\u00d7446 64.3 KB 802\u00d7443 36.5 KB ",

We\u2019re getting to the point where our updates for the meeting take up most of the meeting, which is perhaps not great. Still, I\u2019ll quickly run through our MIPs submission review, which is essentially just where I go through all the formally submitted proposals and confirm that they will be continuing to inclusion polls. I can confirm that all the seven MIPs and subproposals David mentioned will be continuing to the inclusion polls next week.  Other Presentations and Updates Sam MacPherson PSM Usage Update 51:30  The PSM went live at the end of December. It passed the first community executive vote, so that was exciting. We went live with a 3 million debt ceiling. The Lerp module was deployed, which lowered the tin parameter 1% down to .1% over a week. It seemed to work correctly because there was some competitive behavior for sniping those arbitrage positions toward the end and the debt ceiling seemed to get filled almost immediately. Everything went according to plan, so we decided to increase the PSM debt ceiling just a few days ago to continue expanding and moving towards the 500 million target debt ceiling. In addition to that, I had a meeting with Quantstamp. They\u2019re finishing up and finalizing their report. We went over some of the issues. We\u2019re going to have a formalizing finishing up of the report, but everything looks good according to them. As the PSM scales up, we\u2019re starting to see more interesting activity on it even just today. Mostly I was expecting it to be used for arbitrage. So far, it appears that somebody or maybe even multiple people are using it to trade at this point. I wasn\u2019t expecting that at this stage. Due to the lack of the interface, there may be some demand for swapping between stablecoins. I am working with some people to put together a UI that we can throw up to access this more easily. We should produce something similar to Curve where you can go between all the various stablecoins. We have USDC and DAI right now. Still, once we get the other stablecoins on, we could act as basically acts as trading between stable coins with a no slippage sort of situation and fixed fees, so that\u2019s pretty cool. In addition to that, I\u2019ve been working on the PSM flipper so that we can liquidate the USDC-A vaults and the others into the PSM at some point shortly. It\u2019s looking good, any questions? Sebastian Derivaux: What is the plan? What are the next steps to increase the debt ceiling? Are we waiting for an audit or something else? SamM: The plan is to wait for a finalized audit. It doesn\u2019t appear to be anything to review on their end. They\u2019re just formalizing the existing report. I believe they\u2019re running over a couple more things, and then they\u2019ll have their final report out, and once we get a week or so, I think we can continue raising it bit by bit. Sebastien Derivaux: I hope so. LFW: Cool, let\u2019s move on to some of the discussions that we put off. Chris and Nick, you both said you had something to talk about, and I think Primoz did as well. Any of you feel free to chime in.  Discussion Surplus Auction Issues 55:25  Nik: It came to my attention the other day that we\u2019re starting to see 0 bids on Surplus(flap) auctions, which are when the fees, stability fees, and surplus buffer and lots of 10,000 DAI get auctioned for Maker, and then that Maker is burned. So the emergence of a zero bidder points to the environment that we\u2019re in. They\u2019ve probably noticed that maybe there are not as many participants in the auctions anymore with rising gas prices. They think they may be able to snipe one of these things. It\u2019s not a good situation to be in and, quite frankly, until we get liquidations out the door, not just for collateral actions like we were initially planning, but also for the surplus auctions and the dilution auctions. In this particular case, we\u2019re focusing on the surplus ones. It heavily points to me that we should be raising the surplus buffer. There are other good reasons to do so. I know a signal request thread was discussed this week, and there were other arguments on the table. One is that given the current DAI supply, and given that we\u2019re stretching debt ceilings longer than we may be comfortable with because of the bull run, the current insurance buffer of 4 million is not enough. Brian brought up the other argument that if we want to add more LP tokens, we need to have a surplus buffer to cover potential losses from those. The other thing is with the market in a very frothy state. I think it made sense earlier to do lots of burning because Maker was very underpriced in the market. I still think it is, but as the price of MKR goes higher, it makes less sense to do these burns because you\u2019re not burning as much MKR. The final reason is in this transition of winding down the Foundation and handing over all DAO responsibilities. They\u2019re not powers. They\u2019re responsibilities. There\u2019s a lot of costs associated with that. Maybe the community is unaware of that right now. I can speak mostly for oracles, so for example, the feeds got paid 1000 DAI a month, and there are 26 feeds, so you\u2019re looking at 26,000 DAI a month. That\u2019s 300k DAI a year that the community will have to be taking over. That\u2019s not even counting the gas cost for relayers, which is the real significant sum. You have to take into account Gwei is denominated in eth. So as the price of eth goes up. What used to be 120 Gwei is now 30 Gwei. When you see 500 Gwei today, it\u2019s off the charts from what we\u2019ve seen in the past. It got so bad that in December when everything was pumping like crazy, there were days where we had 1000 Gwei to get an oracle transaction update through. That cost $200 bucks per price update per oracle, and we ended up spending $18,000 in gas that day, so that\u2019s the scale of the order of magnitude of costs that we\u2019re working with here. I think the oracle gas problem is unique, and we could probably find a way to use some gas futures to head those costs. To not just focus on the oracles but to say part of the new risk domain teams or new smart contract domain teams coming is that they\u2019re going to want to be paid. Do we want to be dependent on the market not dipping and giving us stability fees at the rate that we\u2019re seeing, or do we want to be sure that we\u2019re going to have that money because we have a large amount of cash sitting in the surplus buffer? Building up the surplus buffer is the most logical thing to do here for so many different reasons. One of the poll options was to raise it from 4 million to 10 million. I think that sounds fairly reasonable.  Chris: I\u2019ll add to this. I also support adding a bigger surplus buffer for the amount of DAI we have as a shock absorber, and 10 million does sound reasonable. I\u2019ll add for the flap auctions. I\u2019ve been paying close attention to them, probably out of anxiety all options for a while now. It seemed that right around an ETH price of 700, a couple of keepers would drip a bunch of our ilks, and then they would call the flap. It became unprofitable for them to do that. There\u2019s only a 2% beg on 10,000 DAI, so there\u2019s only a 200 possible dollar profit each time they call that, and the drips are expensive. We lost that ability, which was a very elegant thing because Maker incentivized people to call drips. Which is something we need people to do. I\u2019ve been talking to Primoz, and I think there could be adjustments to the lost size that will get us back to that. Until then, use the interface that Brian put in the sidebar and don\u2019t let zero auctions go through. This is just tangentially related if we flip over to the flip auctions. I\u2019ve been looking at those, and there does not appear to be any profit motive to call bite on these things or the infrastructure to call bite. It is enormous if you want to call bite efficiently. Suppose you do it just by using your nodes\u2019 abilities. In that case, it\u2019s still an extraordinary considerable expense to find those vaults that you can bite. Then there\u2019s no guarantee that the person who bites wins. Those bites are becoming very expensive in infrastructure and gas.  I think that it\u2019s probably time for us to take the fund that Sam was talking about and pay someone to run a keeper on all the ilks that effectively call bite the dockerized auction keeper and) auction keeper code has a bite only mode that you can run these things in (and you could run it, so it bites all the auctions, and then people would bid, which\u2019s less expensive. In liquidations 2.0, we\u2019ve added an incentive into calling bite so that this problem will be solved then. Still, until we get there, I think we should heavily consider employing two people for redundancy just for calling bites. SamM: Regarding the need for altruistic actors to be calling bite and drip and all of this kind of stuff. During the holiday break, I hacked a new module called DssChron, which can be used to pay people to form markets around these otherwise altruistic requirements so that we can pay people to compete for these chron jobs going and keep the whole system running without relying on employing one or two actors to put the flat sum to maintain these. I think it\u2019s better to have markets form around these, which can be used in the medium future.   D_zap: Sorry if I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. Two things, I\u2019ve never spoken on these polls before. Secondly, believe it or not, this is the first time in my life using Zoom. Anyway, this is the thing. I just started following the online chat only in time to see this discussion. I saw Chris\u2019s comment where he outlined something I\u2019m totally in agreement about. That\u2019s the importance of the drips and incentivizing the old keepers who used to do them. As someone whos watched for quite a long time and been involved with various auctions myself, I just wanted to show maybe an angle that some people may not necessarily have about how this situation came about. To cut to the point, I agree with you entirely and want to explain why. I think there can be a bit of a fallacy where people look at historical flaps and think, well, we have 500 or so. We\u2019ve never had a problem with these parameters, so why would they appear now? I would point out that two straightforward things have changed. One is the market\u2019s volatility, how much MKR moves and gas prices etc. the second one is much more subtle. The nature of the players changes all the time. New bots are appearing, and they behave differently. The bots that have appeared lately, I don\u2019t see this negatively or critically. Still, the correct way to describe their behavior is parasitic; they never kick an auction themselves. Yet, they are pleased to take an existing auction close to zero edge because, of course, as Chris pointed out, it costs very little to do so. Precisely the same for flips as well. This is a game-changer. It was a game-changer for the old keepers for apparent reasons. If you look at the sweet spot of the profitability for a keeper, it\u2019s vanishingly thin. Let\u2019s imagine that you submit an initial bid for 1.5% of edge, and the market only has to move half a percent of edge down. One of these bots who never kicks themselves can dime you. You lose your fee, and again, because of the cost of drips, that fee could be very high. You go back to flaps historically, and you look at how much keepers have paid to kick off an option, and it varies between something like 20 and 200 dollars.  If you\u2019re losing that much, it\u2019s not sustainable. Likewise, suppose the market only moves half a percent the other way and you\u2019re only winning an auction for one percent of edge again. In that case, I think this is something many people may need clarifying to them. Winning an auction for 1% of edge is not profitable because Maker-DAI is a very awkward pair to hedge. Maker-ETH, ETH-DAI being obvious, and there\u2019s no way you could reliably do that hedge and give up less than 1% in the process on fees and other things. that is the real reason why these zero bids have started happening. The value of the beg is now so small. There\u2019s a particular value of being first in now due to the size of the beg and the behavior of the bots and volatility of the market that value has become zero. It\u2019s worthless being first in which is why all the old keepers have quit the market entirely because they\u2019re not incentivized, or they have wholly adopted new behavior where they\u2019ve said, \u201cyou know what, I\u2019m just going to kick off an option and place zero kicks because it\u2019ll cost me nothing and I might get lucky.\u201d Ironically literally, minutes before this call started the last flap, 521. I was the one who prevented the guy who kicked it. He was 2 minutes away from taking the whole ten grand for free. It was by far the closest we\u2019ve gotten. In my opinion, raising the surplus buffer is very likely, not wrong. It seems like postponing the problem if you want to fix the problem, you need to increase the beg. A higher beg will incentivize keepers to submit a sensible offer from the offset because there will be valuable, and you will never have zero bids again because it won\u2019t be the right strategy.  LongForWisdom: I think I speak for everyone when I say that\u2019s completely useful. We never have people with experience as keepers coming on these calls. Nick: If we were to introduce liquidations 2.0, which is essentially a reverse Dutch auction. The cost of capital goes to nothing because you don\u2019t need to hold any of these tokens. You could buy them at the beginning of your transaction or flash loan them. Because the auction instantly settles, there\u2019s no capital lockup. You\u2019re not taking on any price risk on inventory for your bid. Do you think that would go a long way to solve those issues that we\u2019re seeing? I misunderstood the problem because it\u2019s still a race to be first, but you will win if you\u2019re first. D_zap: I can\u2019t see how it would be a downgrade. I would have to study the exact parameters of the Dutch auction. Regarding the capital, that\u2019ll vary from keeper to keeper. I don\u2019t think being capital-constrained is a big issue for many of the keepers. If you look at most of the accounts, they will have enough Maker to do at least 1 or 2 flaps, so I don\u2019t think anyone is flash loaning currently. I think there\u2019s a straightforward way of describing what\u2019s wrong with the current system. The incentives are asymmetric. The cost of getting in is very high compared to the cost of stealing someone else\u2019s auction. So it sounds to me that Dutch auctions would at least be symmetric. That everyone would be on equal footing, and no one would have to make the initial sacrifice of kicking. Still, as I said, I think until then, a higher beg would fix the problem. Brian: Would you say that this is an urgent issue? We don\u2019t have anything slated for tomorrow\u2019s executive, so could this wait go through the traditional governance process? D_zap: I\u2019m so new around here, I don\u2019t know which time scales we\u2019re talking about. Chris: Should we fix it this Friday or next Friday, in your opinion? D_zap: First of all, what sort of parameters would even be considered for the new beg value? Is there a spread that we\u2019re willing to discuss, or does it need to be brainstormed from scratch? Chris: Right now, with many 10,000, that would be anywhere from 3-5% beg would be a 300-500 gain for the keeper if they won the initial flap.  D_Zap: Yes. Chris: Or it could be higher, I don\u2019t know. Brian: Especially if it\u2019s incentivized in drips. That\u2019s something I think we\u2019d be willing to pay for D_zap: If you incentivize competition, you incentivize drips by definition. That\u2019s just how it works. I think it\u2019s important to distinguish between edge and profit. They\u2019re two very different things with these sorts of market conditions with gas being this high. You can win for a certain amount of edge, but your profit can be a tiny fraction of that. I think there\u2019s plenty of people in the Maker chat who have done that thing of submitting by hand to keep the auctions orderly. I don\u2019t think anyone needs explaining as to why this is the best thing to do as soon as possible, especially now that the flaps are not quite regular in terms of their kickoff time because we\u2019ve got all these one-off events like liquidations for the flips, adding an extra surplus, we\u2019ve got PSM contributing additional surplus. I find that it can sometimes create a premature flap option that catches people out. They\u2019re not there to watch it, which can lead to someone, but anyone. I think it\u2019s evident to everyone that this needs to happen once, and it will more than outweigh any extra edge given up on a higher beg. A few hours ago, we were 2 minutes away from it happening. I think the sooner, the better, but at the same time, this isn\u2019t a systemically dangerous amount of money. Brian: We\u2019ve raised the flags on this, and hopefully, we will have the week hammer out the exact rates so we can put it in the following executive. D_Zap: To me, this is already so much better than I expected. I thought these problems were only confined to only the people dealing directly with the issue. When I went on the chat, I saw Chris writing word for word the exact problem.   LongForWisdom: Great, thanks so much for your comments.  Primoz Kordez Risk in a Bull Market 1:20:00  We\u2019re going to talk about Maker preparing for rainy days. I know that this not a popular topic during the bull run, but it should be addressed to simplify briefly. I can sense a community desire to keep increasing debt exposure for Maker because we can finally meet DAI demands. We could fix the peg in a pretty easy way. We have 250 million DAI printed in one month. I think it\u2019s all very positive. Keep in mind we can\u2019t be both aggressively adding new debt to Maker but not reacting to risk mitigation because the rainy days are coming, and we must be prepared. What do we have on the table to protect Maker? Maker capital seems in the right place, but what happens if we have a shortfall event? This means to focus on the surplus buffer, and currently, it stands at 0.3% of DAI debt. Banks usually hold 4% on liquid reserves, and we\u2019re far from it. Chris and Nick talk about why it makes sense to increase it. Ten million would be a good start, although I think it should be higher than what was previously suggested. It should be raised as soon as possible due to the flap issues we\u2019ve been having. Secondly, we also need to think about the keeper ecosystem. The liquidations 2.0 are not close to being released. We need to get more feedback from keepers because we would ideally want to increase bonds, which is the 15 million number. So this is the maximum amount that could be liquidated at once. This is probably the most limiting impediment for me when I get concerned about increasing debt exposure at the scale that we\u2019re doing it. This is one reason why I\u2019m opposed to increasing the ETH-B debt ceiling because 15 million is too small to handle multiple liquidations in various vault types. The third thing I want to mention is that we need to be prepared for increasing rates if we\u2019re going to maintain this healthy risk profile. This means that if we suddenly get 1 million debt exposure, which is quite possible, you never know we may need to go much higher with stability fees from the current one that we proposed, and that\u2019s 3.5, which could cause problems. We know what happened with YFI-A vault where we increased rates because we wanted to catch the exposure. We did a lot more damage because many of the users left who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have. This sometimes means that we should be wiser to limit risk exposure by having fully utilized debt. Although I know this wasn\u2019t popular. Another risk mitigation technique combines this limiting of debt exposure, which is to start introducing high liquidation ratio vaults with low rates alternatively. If this crazy demand for leveraging continues, this could protect us better. I tried to be quick. I\u2019m not going to preach about it here, but I just wanted to lower a bit of the risk appetite. That\u2019s all from my side.  SamM: I want to add for those concerned about turning off the burner altogether, it\u2019s possible we could raise the surplus buffer a little bit at a time using the Lerp module so that we don\u2019t turn off the burner altogether. We can work towards hitting our target surplus buffer. Nick: I think in a bull market, the buy-side from the burner isn\u2019t even that significant either. I don\u2019t think it will affect the MKR price. Chris: Unless the MKR price is super low right now. BrianMcMichael: That boom only set us back to Saturday in ETH terms, so you\u2019re looking at the wrong price.   LongForWisdom: Any other questions before we wrap up?

Then we will meet at EthLisbon in October.   Risk  Proceeding with institutional vault risk assessment  Nexo confirmed that they would be willing to increase their debt exposure by 100m to 200m under these conditions. Still some discussion about origination fee levels. Apart from our risk assessment and work that needs to be done by PE to have these special vaults implemented, we\u2019ll also see revenue impact scenario analysis made by Mark. This is essentially the main decision point at offering these kinds of vaults of particular sizes.   Polygon reached out, asking for a 100m loan collateralized by their treasury MATIC tokens.  Such loans would probably need to reach higher collateralization levels than the one implemented at the upcoming MATIC-A vault. It might be better for them and Maker to set up an institutional vault (origination fees and special requirements regarding LR and maintenance of CR). In discussions with them about this.   Monetsupply should soon make two posts:  One is regarding dust limits and will be a signal poll to confirm whether the community approves the suggested dust limits. He is also working on actual parameter changes needed for off-boarding the KNC-A vault (a showcase of the actual process off-boarding collaterals).   Other:  Most of the other team members are working on risk dashboards and automatization of vault user behavior metrics; a lot of interesting stuff is happening there.

My name is LongForWisdom. I am one of the Governance Facilitators at MakerDAO. We like people to get involved and ask questions or comments, so please, do not be shy if you have something to say.   Weekly Updates  Governance  LongForWisdom 01:25  Current Executive for MOMC Proposal, August Core Unit Budgets, Housekeeping has not yet passed. Planning to include an executive for Friday, August 20th, which will bundle content from the last two weeks. Two polls ended today, August 19th:  Reduce Vault Liquidation Ratios Onboarding PAX Peg Stability Module   There are three ratification polls and three community greenlight polls currently active. Those have 10 days remaining; please vote. In terms of executive, we have the executive from last week. We need votes on that. We will have another executive this Friday that will include the increase for the 6S DC. We will include onboarding for MATIC and the PSM; there are also parameter changes. We will be slightly changing the format of this call and will now move to Forum at a Glance. We will cover Core Units after that.   Forum at a Glance  Artem Gordon 04:13 Forum at a Glance for August 13 - 19  GovAlpha Update  Payton Rose 08:15 GovAlpha Weekly Update  Begun tracking delegates participation and communication metrics. These metrics show up on the vote.makerdao.com voting portal. These are calculated manually, but future participation will be automated. But communications will remain balance because that is much harder to automate. We are still working on getting custody platform integration so we can unlock delegation for larger holders. DUX offers integration help and emailing the larger platforms to offer help and integrating if they need a hand. Making concrete process on the Maker Operational Manual, which will be the platform with governance-focused documentation. Making concrete progress on the Maker Operational Manual under @gala\u2019s management.  @Patrick_J and @AstronautThis producing parameter documentation for the RWA vault parameters and covers the Flap and Flop parameters. Payton is working on documenting the governance vote hash-checking process. We hash the contents of polls, and people can take these hashes and check what is being displayed in the UI to match what is launching. Someone from project engineering, maybe Derek, is also working on updating the executive audit documentation for governance, which I think needs to be updated to cover the DSS executive stuff. Onboarding is going well on GovAlpha; @Sebix is spending most of his working time with us and looking to take on projects like MIPs and forum organization. Gala has been doing well on the Maker operational manual. More projects may be coming soon for contributors.   Protocol Engineering Team Update  Derek 13:11 Upcoming Executive spell Contents:  PAX PSM. MATIC collateral. Reducing ILK Liquidation ratios, which had just gone through. 6S Broker-Dealer address and yanking our deployer address. 6S Debt Ceiling increase. CalcFab into the changelog to improve onboarding.  Focus this week for the team:  We\u2019ve been doing an async GUNI Review focusing on the Oracle; team meeting next Tuesday to conclude. Small enhancements to OmegaPoker that optimizes the order in which collateral prices are updated. We are about 3/4 of the way through setting up the Goerli network; there are just a few outstanding works to wrap up, such as RWA support, removing permissions, updating changelog versions, and general tidy up. Wrapped up some Etherscan spell verification improvements for Mainnet, Kovan, and Goerli.  Collateral:  Deployed MATIC to Kovan. Outstanding: need to define stETH DC limits. We hope to add that to the forum post Talbaneth created some time ago.  Discussions this week:  StarkWare CU includes liaison and discussion of including the risk framework. Prior to this meeting, we discussed how to assess our technical approach to Arbitrum.   Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 17:34  August 20th\u2019s executive vote includes onboarding MATIC. The oracles are live. However, not all feeds have been upgraded; 21/25 are upgrades with just four more left. That should not be a blocker for launch. We previously had a call with the MATIC team reviewing their smart contract oracle solution for stETH. However, we were working on it and identified that the Oracle setup is not gas efficient. The feed-based back end for stETH should be complete within the next couple of weeks. We could have fumbled it around a bit to make it a little more efficient, but there was a fundamental design characteristic of the implementation and how it uses and verifies Merkle proofs prohibitively gas expensive. Instead of going with this kind of bespoke, more decentralized oracle model like what we did with the UniSwap LP tokens, we are falling back on the regular pattern of using feeds. With Merkle proof, you can prove the data on a chain with feeds by getting a consensus like a validator set of what they think is the truth. In terms of a decentralization point of view, it\u2019s worse to use feeds, but in terms of using code, it is probably safer to use the feed implementation. We trust the feed model for everything else. We are not really taking on any extra security concerns and, in the end, Oracles is a cost function. We have to put a significant amount of waiting on how much these things cost. In conclusion, we should have the feed-based back end for stETH done within next week. We would need another week or so for testing. Shortly after that, we could onboard stETH. Assessments coming as soon as August 20th:  UNISwapv3-DAI-USDC SolarX   We are organizing two offsites, one in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, during September. Then we will meet at EthLisbon in October.   Questions  Frank Cruz: I was reading about the cross-chain Oracles that are coming into the market, such as Switchboard, and there\u2019s also another network. Is that something you are looking to do in the near future? They claim to connect HiFi, high-fidelity, market data to the decentralized world. They are also looking to do it to the cross-chain with all these other L1s. Is that something that you guys are thinking about doing in the near future?  Nik: Our Oracle stack is fundamentally blockchain agnostic; every component has nothing to do with Ethereum until you get to the last step to push the value to Ethereum. We can just push data to any blockchain, L1, or any L2. That is not really a big technical lift for us. We still need a cohesive strategy on which chains we should target and maintain support for. Going after all of them at once is not the best idea; it is better to go big on Optimism, Polygon, Solana, or something. Nik: The blockchains that are EVM compatible are the easiest for us to do because it just means that we can redeploy our Ethereum based smart contract Oracles on that chain. The only thing we have to do is spin up a relay to start pushing values to that chain. Nik: Regarding high fidelity, on chains that are more scalable than Ethereum, we can have a much tighter kind of latency pricing or pricing latency on those chains, right. Solana, where transactions are cheap, we could update every 10 pips or something like that vs. Ethereum, which is cost-prohibitive and can only update every half a percent spread. Nik: If there are any chains that you think are particularly promising, I would love to hear why you think that particular chain is something we should focus on. At the moment, we are figuring out where the industry is heading and where people are expanding to.   Frank Cruz: I was in the Jet protocol forum. They are considering one of our nemeses, and somebody else brought up the Oracle Core Unit. I recommend looking at jet protocol; they are trying to decide the community and use. ChainLink is the front runner right now. Circling back to stETH, Please explain to me how it will work when Eth 2.0 launches, and folks can stake it to protect the network and use it to borrow on something like AAVE or even in Maker. How will you guys make sure that somebody does not get liquidated on AAVE and that stETH is no longer in the borrower\u2019s hands in Maker, if that makes sense?  Nik: When we are talking about tETH? We are talking about the Lido stETH in particular. When you stake with Lido, you are not staking yourself, basically. They are running the validator node, and your stETH is an IOU; you can go to Lido and redeem. You cannot actually redeem, at least not until post-merge. Nik: Lido incentivizes liquidity right between stETH and Eth. For all intents and purposes, the stETH token is just an IOU token. You are inherently trusting in Lido not to have a screw-up where a lot of stuff gets slashed, but if a bunch of stuff were to get slashed, the stETH price would drop. To some degree, they would be insolvent because they could not handle all the redemptions they would owe, so there would not be one-to-one redemption. Nik: I do not think it matters if you take out a loan in stETH and get liquidated, it is not a big deal. Someone else buys the IOU; it is still worth something, but we are dependent on Lido\u2019s staking implementation to ensure that you can get redeemed one-to-one post-merge. It\u2019s not just a function of liquidity.     Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 29:34  We are proceeding with institutional vault risk assessment.   Nexo confirmed that they would be willing to increase their debt exposure by 100m to 200m under the conditions provided in the post. Still some discussion about origination fee levels. Close to reaching a final agreement. Apart from our risk assessment and work that needs to be done by PE to have these special vaults implemented, we\u2019ll also see revenue impact scenario analysis made by Mark. This analysis is essentially the main decision point at offering these kinds of vaults of particular sizes going forward.     Polygon reached out asking for a 100m loan collateralized by their treasury MATIC tokens.  Since such loans would probably need to reach higher collateralization levels than the one implemented at the upcoming MATIC-A vault, it might be better for them and Maker to set up an institutional vault (origination fees and special requirements regarding LR and maintenance of CR). We are in discussions with them about this.   Monetsupply should soon make two posts:  One is regarding dust limits and will be a signal poll to confirm whether the community approves the suggested dust limits. He is also working on actual parameter changes needed for off-boarding the KNC-A vault (a showcase of the actual process off-boarding collaterals). Finally, most of the other team members are working on risk dashboards and automatization of vault user behavior metrics; a lot of interesting stuff is happening there.     Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 34:10  This week, we have published the New Silver audit by Shearman & Sterling and on-chain securitization roadmap. It was a work to summarize everything they said. I discussed the document with them today, and we published it after the call. We started moving forward with GST Capital that is also investing in some ? (34:40) pools. They have some experience in securitization. We are happy to have them work with us and see what they think because, at the end of the day, we are on the same side. We participated in the MIP58 Cayman RWA Asset Foundation\u2019s Know Your MIP call yesterday. It was a cool call to ask all your questions on Cayman Foundation works with all the RWA. You can find the Youtube recording online. We are still working on a risk assessment with Christian. We are trying to get it as soon as possible, but it might be delayed to the end of Sunday. If we do not get it on Friday, we thought it would be better to give one more week to the community to review all the documentation before submitting it to the governance pool. We will not want to rush too much, even if the borrower side is not pleased. It is better not to rush things. Lastly, Mark is working on an institutional Vault analysis. We have discussed it just before this call. We will first review it with Nadia and Primoz before sharing it with the community.   Questions  PaperImperium: I was reading through the legal review that was just posted about Centrifuge. I noticed there were quite a few things on there, some of which were pretty important. You recommended we do not move forward until they are fixed, but I saw that the estimated timeline for those is the end of 2021. Can you provide a little more background on what the process looks like to get this done?  I do not know where you read that we do not want to move forward on some items. I do not have this impression.   PaperImperium: It says, \u201cWe should fix these before moving forward.\u201d  For the short-term items, as fast as possible, and some are already being fixed. If I put the end of 2021, it is mainly because I know there are delays, and I do not want to overstate the speed at which we can go.   PaperImperium: What do we do with the Centrifuge stuff that is going on now?  I do not have any recommendations on that. I am pretty happy with it. I will not say it is sophisticated to the institutional level. Still, it represents what we have discussed with the community in the past, and improvements are made every month. If it were me, I would invest more in those pools and only invest 100 for each pool because you asked me not to invest more.   PaperImperium: Many of these are really serious issues that we have talked about for months and are just getting a legal review. It should have been the first step, but now that we have it, how do we constructively move forward to limit our risk to these? As for the legal review timeline, I am not a Legal CU, and we do not have one. It was not my decision to onboard the Centrifuge asset without a legal review. As it was not my decision to onboard all assets, we have without legal review. To my understanding, currently, there are zero criteria with a legal review because there is no Legal CU. Moving forward, you can decide whatever you want. PaperImperium: Moving forward to address these, it looks like we need to have our Maker\u2019s representation sit down and come up with some alternative language for these. Right? Is Centrifuge going to pay for these legal bills too? It looks like we are paying the legal bills for a structure that they should have had ready to go at the beginning of the year.  We are not paying for their lawyers. We are paying for our lawyers. My understanding of all legal deals is that there is a lawyer on each side.   PaperImperium: We did not have a lawyer on our side until recently.  Correct. That is why I put in the budget that I wanted to hire a lawyer. There is an item in my budget for that. It was to make the legality of stuff.   PaperImperium: We are sitting at a point where we have already authorized 44 million dollars of exposure to something we did not have a legal review until now. It has lots of problems, and we will pay more legal fees to fix what they should have done the first time correctly. Is that correct?  It is not my understanding, but if that is your interpretation, sure.   PaperImperium: Are we going to be paying more legal fees to fix Centrifuge\u2019s legal structure, yes or no? Lucas: Centrifuge is engaging lawyers to work together with you to improve the structure. Paper, if you want to put it that way, you can, but we are working on that together, as Seb said. Maker has certain requirements, Centrifuge has certain requirements, and our asset originators may have certain requirements. We are all making sure that we find the best solution moving forward. That is what this on-chain securitization roadmap is about. David Utrobin: I think Paper\u2019s question is specifically about who pays the bill for the lawyers. Lucas: The lawyer representing Maker now is paid by Maker. The lawyer that is drafting these agreements and is working with the Maker lawyers who have brought up these questions is paid by Centrifuge. PaperImperium: We are paid less than anybody else on it and have a terrible legal structure, and now we will pay to rebuild their structure. Lucas: Paper, let\u2019s keep this out of this discussion for now because it is irrelevant. There is also an ongoing effort to build specifically a legal structure by Maker that is only usable by Maker for SolarX. Maker has a lot of precedent building the legal frameworks that you need on Maker\u2019s dime. PaperImperium: Except that we are doing it for your platform here. Lucas: No, you are doing it to ensure that MakerDAO, which is the only DAO that we interact with so far, has equally strong legal protections as individual investors.  We invested a lot to onboard Sushi LP, and we did it until the end. We are developing and investing a lot in Aave, and we are paying for everything. It is the same.   PaperImperium: Except that Aave and Sushi do not come to us so that we build something that will be legally viable\u2026 Someone: The problems we are fixing are many, and many are very familiar since we talked about them for months. Moving forward, I would feel much more comfortable if a third party in the room can observe any discussions between RWF and Centrifuge on how to fix this. Not me, but please find someone else who can independently report to the DAO how these negotiations go forward. I do not feel that we were dealt fairly with the first time, and I want to make sure that we are this time. Lucas: None of the MKR holders have indicated this to me, Paper, and so far, none of the executive votes or signal requests struggled here. LongForWisdom: We can continue that in the forum if you wish to figure out a third party that would be willing to do this.   Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 45:10 Growth CU Weekly Updates  One of our ideas for the rest of the year is to replicate what we did in Argentina. We found a strategic partner and created a product that could fix something in the country. That partner was Buenbit. After two years of working with them, they started this awesome product around DAI offering to Argentineans. Now they are expanding their business to other Latin American countries. In this solution, they could save their money in DAI and get yield over the balancing DAI. Argentineans are using Buenbit as a bank. As soon as they receive their salary, they are converting their salary into DAI. Buenbit started to do business with other companies in Argentina to offer a service where employees will receive their salary automatically in DAI. Whenever they need to pay for something, they now have a card to start paying in pesos. That was amazing. It was impossible for Maker, even when we were at the Foundation, to create a product that could solve specific needs for a country. We are trying to find these strategic partners in different countries to create a product that fits the market they want to target. This is something we are starting to do with imToken, which is a wallet in China. A couple of years ago, when the gas fees were not a problem, we launched a campaign with them, and we had a lot of CDPs open through imToken. We want to understand what we can do with the Chinese market and increase DAI awareness through them. Not to start talking about DAI the same way as we talk about DAI in Latin America, but trying to understand how DAI could fit into the Chinese market. We prepared a plan to execute with them in the next months for the rest of the year. Jennifer created a post in the forum asking for everyone\u2019s feedback about BitPay. We want to create a campaign to increase the usage of Dai on that platform. I do not know if you read Jen\u2019s post, but it is funny because people use DAI to buy luxury things, for example, renting Yachts. DAI users are interesting people. I want to give a welcome to Hajive, who joined the team yesterday. He will be covering Europe with Gustav. His background is interesting because he comes from the traditional financial markets. He is very used to working with institutions. He worked with JPMorgan and Reuters. A couple of years ago, he started to work in crypto, working with Wirex and Luno. It will be great to have him on the team because he can help us with these new ideas that we want to implement around the Maker and institutions. His user name in the forum is @hajive. You can say \u201chello\u201d to him in the forum. As for the start of the week, Jen will be participating in the Web3 Fashion Week. It is a big NFT conference where different creators in fashion and art will be talking, and Jenn will be talking about why DAI and Maker around NFTs. In the forum, I talked about just one integration, one partner. Still, in the week, we have a lot of integrations. On Maker Growth Twitter, you can find a lot of these new integrations. I hear that Primoz and Derek mentioned something about institutional Vaults. I did not include it in the updates that you will find in the forum. We thought about institutional Vaults as Vaults that could have different risk parameters because we were expecting larger amounts of DAI minted from those Vaults. We are starting to work with Nexo. At the same time, thanks to the visibility, because many people are reading the forum, we have had different institutions. Institutions in the sense of other crypto banks, crypto companies like Nexo, and crypto projects with a crypto treasury. To answer your question, Long, One of the first interested in opening an institutional Vault with their Token treasury is Polygon. We also have other projects that will be interested in doing something like that. I think this is good to start to think about. We were just discussing with Primoz that, in the case of Polygon, it might not make sense to have a regular Maker Vault for Matic because everyone is using their Matic inside the Polygon network. It will be more logical to have an institutional Vault for the Polygon team to use their Matic to mint DAI for more acquisitions and deploy that DAI into the Polygon network. This opens a lot of new opportunities for us. When we want to onboard a Token as collateral, we should not do it as always do - having a regular Vault. We could think about having institutional Vaults first. If we see that their community will be interested in having a normal Vault, we could go for that. That is on the institutional side of the Vaults. We had a very interesting conversation with Aave about the D3M that will bring a lot of liquidity of DAI into Aave. We want to launch that product as soon as possible to start testing this D3M into the Aave V2 Market. Depending on the results and how this is working, we could also expand the D3M into the Aave ARC, the Aave for institutions. That will bring DAI to these private pools for institutions, which is super exciting for the protocol.   Questions  Frank Cruz: Speaking of Aave institutional, are you guys still talking to Fireblocks? The former SCC guy is joining them.  Yes, we are.     Content Production Update  Seth Goldfarb 55:16 Content Production Biweekly Updates  For those of you that do not know me, I am Jerry from Content Production. We got a lot of stuff posted in the last few weeks: video, audio, and \u201cDai on different networks.\u201d We are making \u201cDAI on different networks\u201d and Maker Relay available on our substack. We are tabling the mascot contest right now. The bad news is that we only got one entry. The good news is that it was pretty good. We have had some team discussions about why we did not get as much response as we had hoped. One of the main things that came up was that previously when people have tried to do art contests with MakerDAO, there was a lot of response that it seemed like it could be a scam because nothing about it was on official channels. That is one of the things we are considering is possible. On that note, we are currently working with GovAlpha on a MIP for asset allocation so CUs can request access to different properties that are proposed to be owned by the DAI Foundation. Lastly, we have conducted a lot of brand research interviews. If you have not already, please schedule one with us. We are currently discussing and figuring out how to summarize and follow up on that in the forums. Keep your eyes out for that. We have upcoming AMAs with Planet_X and the Centrifuge Team that will be announced soon.   Questions  David Utrobin: Is Content Production looking for somebody specializing in brand and brand systems?  Seth: Potentially. Right now, we are discussing a structuring of the team in different regards based on many of the needs we fielded from the community, including the marketing informal poll that we had up. We are also following up on that in the same post with the brand research stuff. Based on those responses, we are deciding in which directions the structuring of the team should go. Does that make sense?   David Utrobin: You are not sure if a person that specializes in brand and brand systems is necessarily helpful at this stage. Right?  Seth: Not a hard no. But basically, yes.     Governance Communications Update  David Utrobin 58:49 GovComms Bi-weekl Update  I am David Utrobin, the facilitator of GovComms. Setup is moving slow. We still have not gotten our first disbursement of DAI due to the delayed executive. We have three new contributors being trained for the summary team. Welcome, Andrea Suarez, Rhodey, and Kunfu-po. It is cool to see the summary team expanding slowly. We are continuing our hunt for an engagement lead. If you know any rock stars interested in this role that involves a lot of stakeholder relations, engagement, and mapping Maker down and stakeholders, we are hunting. We are hunting on two fronts. We have the talent CU that is being incubated under SES, helping us. In parallel, I am doing my independent search for this person. Generally speaking, applicants are few. It has been challenging to find decent fits for this role, but there are some, so we will continue the hunt. Maker Relay got a facelift. We have a new banner thanks to Cat. We have a new informational structure thanks to the Content Production team pioneering it. Also, we have a refreshed feedback survey. Lots of progress in Maker Relay in the last weeks. We took ownership of the forum at a Glance and had been making weekly improvements. You have seen Artem presenting it at the beginning of this call. We are going to try to make it as best as we can. Feel free to give us feedback about what we could do to do that. We created a basic GovComms CU overview presentation in our public drive. Our previous one was in Figma, and it was outdated. To increase the transparency of what our team does, I put together a bunch of slides. I took the example from SES because they recommend doing this. We started a team updates audit to make some recommendations to bring us closer to similar standards. This is mostly because I was trying to understand what to put in these updates from our team. I am studying everybody\u2019s updates and trying to document them to have a higher view of everything. We could see what teams are really doing, what they are not, what information is coming across, what is not. In the last weeks, I met with Mario, our Reddit moderator, to discuss his ongoing availability, our moderator needs, and the general state of Reddit. He had a ton of insight about that side of our community. It is mostly new people, and people are just starting to get into Maker. We are going to publish some polished notes in our public drive later today or tomorrow. That might be useful for Content Production, onboarding funnels, for strategy around what we post where. We are starting to collect some data and some interesting insights there. We met with Dumitru from the former foundation Technical Operations team to discuss info security best practices for google drive. As some of you know, our mandate includes the lofty goal of mapping MakerDAO and its stakeholder segments. We intend to collect the identity and contact information for MakerDAO and its stakeholders. Information security is top of mind. We are being proactive about how we are going to manage this project. Our office hours are Fridays 1800 to 1830 UTC. Feel free to join us if you want to get to know us a little more, ask us what we are doing, or inquire about any of the things I just mentioned.

Government Relations  David Utrobin  Government and regulators fall into a class of stakeholders that is very important to MakerDAO. Important to have good relations with these stakeholders. Government relations is a subset of public affairs.  E.g., Paper had a meeting with advisors of a specific lawmaker\u2019s office. Financially supporting pro-crypto lawmakers. Educate crypto regulators.     PaperImperium Updates on Senator Warren Meetings:  Agnostic or underinformed opinions surround us. Security issues are heavy on regulator\u2019s minds. Stablecoins are almost always envisioned as Tether. We need to figure out the regulatory touch of MakerDAO. Senator Warren was clear to get as much of crypto inside a regulatory ring. Next meeting\u2019s agenda: devolve compliance and legal issue burdens down to Core Units. May need to remove the ambiguity of Maker being a decentralized entity to meet specific obligations. We currently lack legal expertise and friends in the legislature. Paper has been trying to reach out to people to help improve this. Another issue: securities laws, which are open to interpretation.  Need professional legal counsel on this.   Should we seek to hire expertise in government regulations?  Core Unit that engages with external legal counseling may be a good method.    ",

How does everyone else feel about that?  20:22 - David Utrobin  Are we kicking the problem down the road? Although it is a large amount of MKR, 84000, at some point, either the protocol will have to re-up on its MKR treasury to continue paying out, or it will have to mint.    20:53 - Planet X  I do not think it is kicking the can. In crypto, the planning horizon is very short, and we cannot plan three, four, or five years ahead. We are avoiding increasing the number of MKR, and we are avoiding minting. It is the same result, and you get your MKR from another pool.  21:33 - Christopher Mooney   I spoke with an attorney on this. It does seem that the least risky legal move is to pull it from the reserves that we have in the pause-proxy and not to mint it. There are mechanisms in the protocol that end up minting, and we want to keep that minimum. There is the challenge of deauthorizing the old module and adding a module that pulls from the reserves. On your last slide, there was an idea about more technical detail in the MIPS, and I have some musings on that.  22:44 - Wouter  I do not mean more technical detail. I mean a more explicit expression of the next steps. That was the confusion. Brian notes in the side chat that minting was mentioned multiple times, and it is true. The way that the module is described has the mint method. However, the introduction says that the module supports multiple options to source the Dai and the MKR that it can payout. I assumed there would still be an opportunity to switch the implementation from minting to taking it from the treasury.  23:38 - Brian McMichael  There are three different implementations of DssVest. One of them does a strick Token transfer. We already have that capability. It will be easy to deauthorize the old one, add the new one, and reset the streams. I want to clarify that nobody was trying to hide anything; I do not think there was any lack of clarity in the governance process. We attempted to put our exact intentions in every step of the way. As Christopher mentioned, we have some unofficial legal advice that maybe we need to go the other route. I do not know what the next steps are in terms of governance for that.  24:32 - Christopher Mooney  As Wouter pointed out, getting more legal expertise on MIPS would be a really good idea. The PE team cannot provide that other than whatever tangent to the legal system we have all had throughout our careers. However, a specific legal CU or crowdsourcing legal opinion on a myth would probably be good to get a step of the review feedback. I like that proposal letter.  25:08 - Payton Rose  Can we mention the governance side of things. No minting has taken place. It cannot occur until May 1st, the first eligible contract that can mint a new MKR. If this is something that the community felt should be changed that would need to happen, it would be a proposal put up to do so. A signal request is probably sufficient to do so. We are essentially asking the community if they would like to switch over the MKR minting side of the DssVest instead of using the ERC20 stream with the protocol treasury MKR. Typically, our signals go on for two weeks in the forum before bringing them to on-chain polling. And then to an executive. The process would look like in terms of governance, changing how this has been implemented so far.  Wouter: I will use that process to get this started.    26:34 - Payton Rose  A good call up on the sidebar. We express our individual opinions, take our knowledge and expertise, share it with the community, and discuss this. We are discussing the situation and what we, as a community we would like to about it.  26:55 - David Utrobin   Sebastian wrote in the chat that by deciding to take instead of minting, are we agreeing that MKR is a security? What are the implications of that? Is it better to be careful? I do not think we are making this decision. First, there will be a signal process, and voters decide whether or not Maker is a security at the end of the day. They are deciding on where to draw the MKR from. Both options have a certain perceived legal risk. I think the voters, as a governing body, are doing their best to make the wisest choice. I do not think they are making any positive affirmation of the definition of what MKR is as an asset. As Christopher points out, both options have a public relations perspective too. People see the protocol as minting MKR that is different from incentivizing people from MKR already in our coffers.  28:11 - Brian McMichael  There were discussions about burning that whole 84k pot because the pause-proxy sitting in can also mint Tokens, and it is all technically a wash. By doing it with the Token transfer way, we tell the Dao that it has to leave those Tokens there for its other obligations.  28:39 - David Utrobin  What can the Dao do to get more legal subject matter experts to participate? Like the old Maker Foundation lawyers and Juan Guillen on the SES Team, a few people are working on legal review. There are many legal minds around the Dao, and I am curious if people have ideas for attracting more.  29:10 - Wouter  I can talk about the option that we are exploring. Still, it will be a while before it is in place. The issue is that you will have a hard time finding anyone with a serious legal background giving detailed opinions about the exact risks or engaging in this discussion fully transparently as we are used to with technical subjects. You should, in some way, think about anonymizing or pseudonymizing the feedback that is given. We are exploring collaboration with a project that implements crowdsourcing of legal opinions. I am not sure of the exact mechanics of how that would work. I assume that you would have several voters who are confirmed to have a legal background; I hope the relevant legal background would put up polls to ask certain questions. For example, rank these three options in the order of legal risk. Maybe have some kind of check-in process to ask the legal crowd if this is a risky legal move. Alternatively, if we are about to do something, how would you rate the legal risk. I am not clear on the exact details. We are still very much in the exploratory phase.  31:32 - Payton Rose  If we were to have a legal CU, there would be some checks like our CUs. Facilitators can put the block on certain proposals for relevant risks within their defined CU. That would certainly help the governance process if we had a community-approved body that said we could not approve this, we can go forward with this, etc. CUs take time to set up.  32:19 - Wouter  Can we be more strict about the different types of MIPs and require of technical MIPs? When I looked at the original definition, the technical MIP is supposed to have the exact instructions that would go into the executive vote and the spell. However, it is not always practical to do it. The next best thing would be to have a fixed section that would describe the effect we are voting on in English as clearly as possible. If this were flagged for this MIP that this section was missing, it would have been added, and I would have been very clear that the next step is when this goes into the executive, and these are the consequences. It is a formal technical review of the MIP, but you do not have to have any opinion on the content or judge it in any way to do these formal checks, which would already help a lot.  34:02 - Christopher Mooney  Whatever we end up doing, we have to find a path that is not the extreme granularity of describing exactly what happens. I have noticed that when we are developing these things, people are voting on the MIPS and thinking it is a good idea. Then we get to the implementation phase, and we find little mistakes. There are subtle little changes, and some of those have legal implications. That did not happen in the DssVest case but more generally. With the Liquidation 2.0. we made the MIP be a living document, and we gave these updates about the edits, and it worked out. When voting on an executive, you also vote on the actual real instantiation of what is happening in the code, how it is written, and all of its bugs. That is the caveat; in the end, we are anointing that not everyone is a subject matter expert and needs these high-level descriptions of what is happening. The trick is to keep saying what the code is and show the places where it deviates from the original MIP and describe it. When the final executive happens, everyone knows that this is the original MIP and hears in the comments the changes that were made to accommodate technical considerations or risk and more. That is probably the right way forward. It is a theory versus practice thing. The theoretical version of the MIPs was a little bit more ideal than the reality of writing and publishing it.  35:54 - Juan Guill\u00e9n  We have the MIPs that are pure code and very technical, which might be the platform for those. The other ones are more procedural; I am not sure if, for the MIP writer, we should force people to say everything the way it would be implemented because maybe you do not care. For example, as a receiver for MKR, you can say: I do not care where you get them from. As long as I get them is fine. On the implementation, we need to have a process. I do not know if the MIP editors or someone from GovAlpha, or anyone have an opinion on this. We need to have a process where we say: this is ready to be moved forward because there is only one way to implement it to vote on this. Otherwise, we should say: we will not be able to vote and give the reason. It was mentioned that minting was the preferred mechanism, but also it was open to other mechanisms. Then, you would be like: here is what will happen; once that goes on, MKR will be minted. This has to be done for every MIP that is procedural, not only this one.  37:25 - Christopher Mooney  We need to find certain categories of legal risks or things, create icons for them and add them to them. Like does or does not mint MKR, or something like that.  37:43 - Wouter  This was part of the issue. It was not understood that it makes such a good difference from a legal point of view to mint the MKR versus taking it from the treasury. There was a line that was crossed without realizing it. I am thinking about which permissions to put in that way, permissions that the MIP would use, and have a list of permissions that need very explicit confirmation. MKR minting will be high on the list, and that would be a good idea. I do not know how realistic it is, but it sounds like it will be very useful if we can do it.  38:37 - David Utrobin  At the moment, the MIP editor has a checklist that they go through when a MIP is submitted for RFC. It should be trivial to get Pablo to expand that list to include some seek-out or an extra opinion or services.  39:00 - Pablo  We should reach a consensus around what these points are going to be. One of them is going to be MKR minting. We should reach our consensus about that list; it should be very trivial to implement.  39:16 - Juan Guill\u00e9n  But also Dai payments. Someone could come up and say: I want a third of a multiple of the logarithm of whatever number, and I want that Dai every month. Then Pablo would need a team of mathematicians to help him figure out how much Dai needs to be paid out. All these things are much work, and they need to be checked before we move on things. We need to put the mechanisms there, and it is not an easy thing to do.  39:52 - S\u00e9bastien Derivaux  I wonder on this MIP if the problem was that it was not written or a bit hidden. You can summarize and try to explain things, but you will never explain everything, and there will always be room for interpretation on what is not code. I looked at MIP58 RWA Foundations, and there were only five click-throughs. That means that only five people, and I was one of them, clicked on the link to see what was in the legal document. Some things are complex, and no one will look at and what it does. We need to find ways to solve it because not everyone will look at the code and how it will compile. The result might be something a bit different because there was a bug, and they fixed it, and they do not implement the strict MIP version because it does not make any sense.  41:13 - Wouter  That is the last point I added to the slides, which is the most fundamental one. The model where we rely on MKR holders and the community to review these MIPs without specifying how it will happen is not very scalable. We will need to change that. That is a very different discussion, and I have many ideas about it. I did not want to make this a three-hour call. We will return to that point. However, those are the three things: there was a red line that was not understood. We can clarify these red lines. Formally speaking, the MIP missed the next steps made me misinterpret it. The third element is that we do not have the time and the expertise to review all the MIPs that are up for voting, even if it has been sitting there for months. It is not that the timeline was too short, but we do not seem to have the bandwidth; with all the other work going on, do it, and it is not clearly defined who should review what and for which points. You end up with things not being reviewed and passively being confirmed. That is the most fundamental issue here.  42:58 - Payton Rose  Perhaps it is difficult to write the next steps for a tool like this. For instance, DssVest is also used for a lot of our CU Dai streams. It was set up to be a tool for us to use so we could cut down on the number of superfluous governance votes and that we approved something, and then we had to approve it every month again and again and again for Core budgets that CU have already been promised. Not to say that it would not be better with the next steps, but when you are writing MIPs for general tools, it can be hard to think of the next steps and write them in a way that does not limit their use to the full functionality of what you are building.  43:51 - Wouter  That was exactly the confusion here. This was not a MIP for a general tool, and this was a MIP for the implementation of the deployment of the modules. This one could very easily have had the next steps, and they were not made explicit.  44:20 - Nadia Alvarez  Can we talk about the legal expertise that we need when we are reviewing the MIPs? I like what Wouter proposed about this group that anonymously can answer our legal questions. I would like to know when this is going to be available. If it is not immediately, most of the CUs are working with a legal firm, and we could work together and use these lawyers to review some of these things that we do not know what to do with. Maybe they can meet together, discuss all these things that we do not know, and post a review in the forum.  45:23 - Wouter  You highlight another problem, and it is a principal-agent problem. We are missing the legal expertise, but we are also missing the legal insights to know which lawyer to ask and who has the relevant legal expertise, which is sometimes unclear.  Nadia Alvarez: At least now we have some questions to ask. That is a good starting point.    46:05 - Wouter  Publishing a review is not going to happen. We can do now that we have delegates with a lot of voting power; maybe these legal recommendations or thoughts can be conveyed in private until we can do it more openly with a crowdsourced solution.  46:38 - Nadia Alvarez  We have a lawyer, and he is very into crypto with all the securities laws in the United States. We can work with him and also work with Layer Zero from SES. Meanwhile, we are waiting for a better solution. We can organize meetings with the delegates to share these legal opinions, and I do not know if any other CU is working with lawyers. Let me know when we can arrange a meeting with all of them to review these topics.  47:30 - Wouter  We have at least one lawyer in RWF CU not acting as a lawyer. We have three law firms on a retainer. One is in the comments. It is not very useful for these topics. The problem is that it depends on how you phrase the question. If you ask, is it riskier to mint MKR or use MKR that are already minted? It is less risky to use something that is already minted. That is level one of the answer. Level two of the answer is: maybe it is riskier, but it does not make any difference in the end. Another answer could be: you have a big problem because of x and this problem choosing between the two is not your biggest problem. When you give me this problem, I can tell you that your problem is way bigger. It is more of a discussion, and I do not know how you can frame it. It is not easy. Just asking one question will not give you the answer. It will give you one answer but not the context of the answer.   Government Relations  David Utrobin 49:54  Government and regulators fall into a class of stakeholders that is very important to MakerDAO. For our desire to be a global protocol that is allowed to exist globally, we want to do what we can to be above board top tier as an organization. It is important to have good relations with these stakeholders: nation-states, governmental publics, people who are writing laws about blockchain, about DeFi. Government relations is a subset of public affairs that organizations typically do. You interact with the most outer layer of your stakeholders: governments, legislators, interest groups, the media, and government relations are specific to the Government. For example, PaperImperium had a meeting with advisors of a specific lawmaker\u2019s office, so you can go and do that with specific lawmakers. You can attend, speak, network at governmental conferences. Some lawmakers have done this with regards to representing crypto and DeFi. There is also Financially supporting pro-crypto lawmakers. Organizations do Government relations to prevent unwise regulations and reduce political, regulatory risk by educating crypto regulators, bringing them open-mindedness. Often, regulators will not have a very open line of communication with what it is that they are regulating. Breaking down those barriers is important. Also, to uncover nuance that regulators might not understand. They are not subject matter experts. We are,  the people in the DAO are. Whom do we send? How does MakerDAO do Government relations? We send qualified individuals, subject-matter experts, recognized delegates (like PaperImperium). People are willing to share legal opinions. The CU might also do governmental relations for the DAO. Generally speaking, there are a ton of things to bring up with regards to MakerDAO. Maker does not have a very small range of topics.   PaperImperium 53:39 Updates on Senator Warren Meetings:  Even by lawmaker standards, we are uninformed and under-informed. Most of the people I have talked with are very agnostic about crypto and not very interested. There are a few who have developed strong opinions. However, you do not have to get into technical details to hit some major misinformation for most of them. We are years behind where we should be. Getting people familiar with the real basic crypto information, never mind MakerDAO specifically. For example, the idea that every token is not its blockchain is widespread. Securities issues are heavy on regulator\u2019s minds. As far as MakerDAO, we have two specific and related issues. The one that vexes most of crypto is the securities issue. I am not a lawyer, but I think we have a lot more breathing room here than most protocols have. We are not selling interest-bearing tokens and interest-bearing products, which seem to be drawing much attention because you have the expected return. When you talk about stablecoins, they are envisioning Tether in USDC. They hold a dollar that is, in some ways, a deposit that is expected to be withdrawn at some later date. In traditional banking, insurance, or other forms of finance tradition, they live off the interest, so they get on that float. Our biggest problem that we need to solve before moving on to any of the other ones is: where our regulatory touch lies? This is a big problem, and it is also easy to relate to. To get across to lawmakers, perhaps it should be one of the things we focus on first. We had discussions like what would happen if someone wanted to sue the DAO or subpoena the DAO? Send a letter to the DAO about anything? Whom do they call? Senator Warren\u2019s advisor was clear that consumer protection and getting crypto inside a regulatory ring-fence as much as possible are their top priorities. Even if there was something specific that we wanted to comply with because the protocol lives on the blockchain, how would we do that? Because we are decentralized to the point where we do not have a legal entity. As a result, we do not have individuals who can sign binding agreements, documents, representations, and disclosures. We have another meeting in a few weeks (date TBD). I asked for this to be the only agenda to find a way to devolve legal tax reporting, all the compliance, and legal issues. Find a way to decentralize those burdens down to CUs because some CUs may or may not be engaging in regulatory behavior, regulated activities. Even if we have two that are, they might not deserve the same regulatory treatment. Then, different CUs are in different jurisdictions. The details would have to be carefully thought out. If there were a way to register as a decentralized entity, it would potentially remove the ambiguity about Maker being decentralized. All of these reporting requirements and obligations will have to be met at some point. Right now, it is not clear who should, what they are. At some point, it may become clear. We need a way to interface with these regulators in the largest financial market in the world. Otherwise, it is going to limit our ability to grow. Decentralization is not a crypto-specific problem, although it is mostly seen in crypto. That is our first battle. The good news is that nobody says: \u201cYou are decentralized, and you will go to prison.\u201d It is not a crime. Our worst-case scenario is that we pile up a lot of fines, which we do not want. We lack legal expertise, friends in the legislature. If neither of the republican or democrat senators I have reached out to about this is interested, I will start reaching out to people in the house to see if we can move on our side. I have also reached out to folks at other regulatory agencies that would not get us the broad brush across all US regulations. Issue number one is decentralization: How does the DAO even file paperwork? How would we file a disclosure?. Another issue is securities laws which seem very open to interpretation. We do not have legal counsel looking into this, and we need to fix that. It is related to what we talked about in the first hour about MKR. My non-lawyer thinking of why it would be better to draw from the treasury makes no difference economically. Securities actions seem to be brought against issuers. All MKR in circulation today was minted. Probably safe to say it is all under the Foundation. The DAO did not mint it, so we are not the issue.  David Utrobin: Minus the black Thursday minting that happened to cover the seven and a half million dollar plus or so.   Those were privately placed with VCS.  David Utrobin: Not privately, and it was done through a public on-chain auction.   I do not know enough about that and the specifics of the Foundation\u2019s involvement at that point. This is exactly why we need to hire somebody whose job is to figure this stuff out.  David Utrobin: Do you think that the role of government relations lies with a specially equipped delegate, like yourself? Should one of our CUs seek to hire a government relations officer? Somebody senior who can represent the DAO, aggregate everything you have said, and start working through all the senator offices.   The DAO should probably be agnostic about in which direction it gets outsourced. The benefit of having a delegate is that you can not agree to anything, but you can know what is likely to float past a vote. A CU that engages external help might be the best solution. Some professionals do this. Unfortunately, they are not cheap, but you need people who have these personal relationships which are non-transferable. We do not have that. Some people in the Foundation do, but it will not be around much longer, so we need to spread our wings. I am not a lobbyist. Lobbying, trying to draft legislation, give to people, and perhaps make donations, come with reporting requirements and a certain level of discretion. It may or may not be compatible with our transparent method of governance. It is a moot point because there is a deficit of basic information. During the Gensler hearing last week, Senator Warren asked about decentralized exchanges and transaction costs. He said that would be a function of their user agreements. UniSwap and SushiSwap do not have user agreements that determine gas fees right. That is where we are at, and everyone was happy with that answer. There is a complete lack of understanding. I asked Senator Warren\u2019s banking advisor if I was the first person from crypto talking to them. He mentioned they had some lobbying people talking to them occasionally. Their job is to talk to people that do not like us.  David Utrobin: There is a distinction happening. There is education about the general crypto truths and nuances and the Maker specific knowledge that regulators would be interested in knowing at the latest stages of lawmaking.   In regards to any stablecoin regulation, we are built differently. Our end product looks very similar to USDC or Tether from the user perspective. Still, just like a bank and a credit union look the same from the parking lot, we are built differently on the inside. We have different risks, and we deserve a different regulatory touch if we can find a way to get into these technocratic details. This is a golden opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves from all the other major stablecoins. There is also the danger of getting swept up with onerous requirements laid upon these other ones because they are susceptible to bank runs, and we are not. Some are concerned about neutering the fedge because stablecoins are getting too big. We are naturally suited. We make the natural partner because, by our design, we have to accept the fed policy as it transmits through the economy. They will ask what we feel about CBDCs as competitors. They would make great collateral, but unless they are on Ethereum, they are probably not competitors. These are new ideas even for \u201ccrypto-knowledgeable lawmakers.\u201d  MakerMan: I agree that the space where Maker interacts with politics is important. Still, it is not only about Maker. There is a whole bunch of decentralized DAOs out there. If we do it in a Vacuum, it can have implications for a ton of other DAOs. Maybe we can start the path, but what needs to happen here is a greater effort.  To be a good DAO citizen, we have to think about the larger stakeholders and the implications of dealing with legislators and educating them about bringing legal online. We should be looking at forming a DAO of DAOs, some organizations of DAOs. We can get input and construct documents that educate these people about what a good collection of DAOs would like to see. Bring greater brainpower, greater funding. This is not just a Maker thing. We can do it together. It will take longer, but we cannot do that in a vacuum. We need to pull other minds and funds together to create an organization to push through this stuff. Juan Guill\u00e9n:  We are working on an L0 from the SES CU leading this initiative. This is one of the grants that we have given, and it is our research on many legal implications. We will be giving updates about this soon.     Final Discussion 01:10:10  David Utrobin: MakerMan\u2019s point about make a more broad legal effort along with our industry to engage with nation-states, governments, and regulators. It is a powerful idea for potentially getting everybody to agree on a list of pertinent points that regulators should understand about our industry. Beyond that, protocols should make an individual effort. Each one has so much nuance that the legal questions they will be asking will be a very broad range. Who will lead the charge? Brian McMichael: There are some general lobbying organizations in the industry. In New York, doing lobbying, there is the DeFi Education Fund put on by UniSwap. The new LeXpunK DAO is being funded by Curve and YFi. If we wanted to pull our resources with some or all of the other protocols, these might be some options. We feel strongly about it.  Juan Guill\u00e9n: In this initiative that I mentioned - UniSwap and Compound were there, there are a couple more projects. I read the proposal some weeks ago, and I do not remember fully, but L0 will update soon. David Utrobin: Do we know if any of these groups have been doing targeted outreach to specific lawmakers similar to the example of PaperImperium and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s office? I feel skeptical about these groups creating educational initiatives if they never reach out to any lawmakers. PaperImperium: I have been extremely overwhelmed with them. Perhaps many things are not visible, but I have never met someone at this point who does more than merely knowing some lawmaker people. They will struggle for the group names, all blockchain associations, or whoever. How do we get to this point where even our friends run into the staff - that has been serving under people that are very pro-crypto. Forget smart contracts. Forget Maker. In their defense, they are not trying to be domain experts. They are thinking about Afghanistan, tax policy - we are not the front of their thoughts. I give them the benefit of the doubt to newer organizations, but for some of these established organizations, where have they been? MakerMan: That is the nature of lobbying. They will not announce whom they are talking to, the conversations they have. It makes me wonder if we are going in the right direction by having these discussions in the open. Someone: At the end of the day, the ultimate objective is to have a collaborative and positive interaction with a Government and a government regulator. Anything that advocates and pushes that forward is positive. Many could go down this path of rage against the machine as if we were in a bubble. We will go 100 times farther the more that we can have a constructive tone always.   Payton Rose: A lot to reflect on and consider. I appreciate the high level of participation today.

Welcome to the Scientific Governance and Risk meeting #138, taking place on Thursday, April 22nd at 17:00 UTC. My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the Governance Facilitator at MakerDAO. If you have comments or you want to ask questions, please do interrupt. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.    Governance  The Governance process went well. Our latest executive passed with some critical bug updates that were fixed and will be addressed soon.   Polls  We have 7 green lit polls running for the next ten days. please vote if you have not. Both YFI liquidations 2.0 parameters and the MIPs monthly cycle pass and will conclude before this week\u2019s call. LongForWisdom will be confirming the MIPS monthly cycle. He will also have an update on YFI.   Governance Alpha  We\u2019re making good progress on the delegation front. We are looking into snapshot voting implications. We are reaching out to interested parties who wish to delegate. Likewise, there has been progress in the MIPs Portal; we\u2019re looking to get some additional functionality with filtering options. Quick update on SourceCred; Shout out to Matt from 6S for his forum post concerning increasing distributions. We work with the SourceCred team on setting parameters and having some forthcoming changes. Your input on the forum is very helpful.   Weekly Updates  Forum at a Glance  Elihu 03:46 Forum at a Glance - Forum Thread  Three-Point Summary  MKR hits ATH again this week with 4878 USD System surplus buffer is steadily filling up and now at 26.7 million Total DAI supply is also growing now. It\u2019s at 3.6B   Announcements  The liquidations 2.0 upgrade is now voted in. Feel free to check the blog post to know what it means to Maker ecosystem and community. In another post, Kurt and the smart contracts team go into detail about the reasons for the delay in the recent executive vote delay.   Discussions   Real-World Assets - Strategy for 2021  With the first Real-World Asset operational (New Silver), the RWA team discusses strategy for 2021.    Liquidations 2.0 Auction Duration Tradeoffs   @Primoz presents an analysis of possible scenarios resulting from different Liquidations 2.0 auction durations.    What If\u2026 A Powerful Intelligence Agency Attacked The Emergency Shutdown   @flipflopflapdelegate starts a discussion on various Emergency Shutdown attack vectors.     Signal Requests   PAX vault DC change   @alexis is looking to adjust the PAX stablecoin\u2019s Debt Ceiling.    Adjust Liquidation Ratio for UNI-V2-DAI-USDC-A Vault Type   @monet-supply is seeking consensus on reducing the Liquidation Ratio on the UNI-V2-DAI-USDC-A Vault.     Smart Contracts Team Update  Christopher Mooney 05:58  Thank you to everyone who voted on the executive, which passed. We were anxious because this resulted from 12 months\u2019 worth of work to ship Liquidations 2.0. It will be on a tight cadence from Kovan to mainnet for another 4 to 6 weeks. We currently put YFI on Kovan, which is collateral number two. We\u2019re now beginning to construct the mainnet spell for it. In addition to YFI, there are other changes as well because we have a large backlog. We will see a ton of work from the Rates Group, along with some DC and instant modules changes. All of that is going into the spell. We can deploy all of the ETH collateral types in WBTC to Kovan On Friday and prepare for mainnet the next week. We passed the executive promoting 25% to the burner, and the rest accrue to the surplus buffer and target of 60 million. We\u2019re planning to use the Lerp module, which will get us there over time. This is not a perfect solution. The target of 25% may vary because edge cases can result in a different number. We set up a particular time target over that period. Also, one anomaly that\u2019s worth calling out is if we were to see massive series of liquidations, the 13% fee will be accrued to the surplus buffer, which could put us over the amount that we can set the DC to at any particular time. That will create a whole bunch of flap auctions. These actions are surplus and thereby possibly exceed a 25% burn.  Brian: Lerp has been updated to set an arbitrary start date. May 1st, 2021, is the start date. We are merely making an estimate right now and hoping our expectations will match reality. Chris: We have a densely packed executive run coming up; we have the Friday executive and then the Monday executive, YFI, and rate changes. Everything needs to be voted in over the weekend if MKR holders want to see it executed because, on Monday, another executive bundle will enter the portal, which will need to execute in four and a half days. Please stay active over the weekend. We need all MKR holders to vote for these executive proposals. Brian: We should put a time limiter on the spell for this Friday and make sure that the spell doesn\u2019t get executed before the other one. There should be a version check or something like that, which will prevent it from being cast to prolong past the pause delay.     Oracle Team Update  Nik Kunkel 13:47  We\u2019re still working with Defi Saver to get their light feed running. They released a new feature where you can compose transactions. They\u2019re dealing with some bug repairs while in production. We may have it up by early next week and hopefully include it in next week\u2019s executive. We should onboard another wave of light feeds. As the protocol scales, there is more DAI supply and thereby more collateral. You want to increase the number of signatories on this multi-sig. Increase the threshold for launching an oracle attack, thereby making coordination more difficult. I started reaching out to some projects. We can see applications rolling out in the next couple of weeks within the forums.  Andrew: I use Defi Saver for leverage and boosts. It repays you at different levels, but it\u2019s a 2 hours delay when the OSM kicks in. Can it help to execute at market price, or is that unrelated? Nik: It\u2019s completely unrelated. Defi Saver would be one of the inputs into the medianizer. The medianizer is that real-time ETH price that gets fed into the OSM at the top of the hour. the OSM creates that one-hour price delay. Defi saver is an app that uses the OSM price. It doesn\u2019t affect how the user interacts with Defi saver.   Nik: I\u2019ve started testing the Uniswap LP oracle code with Sushiswap LP tokens which you presume automatically works because Sushiswap, at least the swap component, is almost a direct fork of a Uniswap; nonetheless, this is something that we should test to gear up the Sushiswap Cropjoin that Sam has been working on. Also, we have the audit from ABDK. Nik: We need to redeploy the LP oracle tokens for all of the Uniswap LP tokens that we\u2019ve onboarded so far because they\u2019re using the smart contract specifications we launched in late December. After the audit, we have some expected changes. We\u2019re planning to have that transition within the next few weeks.  Frank: A few months ago, you mentioned raising the oracle sensitivity for some of the collaterals. I brought this up to pre-motion about LINK, and I know you mentioned that they raised it to 4% except for ETH and wBTC. Could you give us an update on what\u2019s going on with that? Are we saving any money? Nik: I don\u2019t have a hard number in front of me, but just looking at the amount of ETH that\u2019s been funneled into the relayers, it\u2019s decreased. That validates your assumptions. We did raise the price sensitivity to 4%, which means that the price has to change by 4% before the medianizer updates. 1% sensitivity was too expensive, but it worked out well for ETH and BTC. Also, those vaults are relatively large; we want to increase the sensitivity there. It doesn\u2019t make sense to do that for vaults that have less than 100 million.   LongForWisdom: In the forum, we lost one of the dark feeds. Is that a concern for you?  Nik: No, their particular circumstances are, \u2018I\u2019m retiring, and I don\u2019t want to deal with crypto anymore.\u2019 Frank: The OSM wasn\u2019t catching up. Remember when everything was dropping? Nik: The transaction to the OSM at the top of the hour wasn\u2019t going through because of the spike in gas prices. Even though we were increasing the gas cost of the transaction, it took many hours to go through. We try to be more aggressive on gas prices. Still, it comes down as a cross-function. The frequency of updates vs. how willing you are to get precise gas costs vs. how much money you are trying to save by varying the time by a few minutes. We don\u2019t have a perfect solution, but I plan to deal with it.     Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 22:13  Two days ago, we published a post concerning the Liq 2.0 parameters related to the expected auction duration. We analyzed to show how delayed bits may impact Maker and vault owners. Even if auctions were to last up to an hour and a half or, in some cases, up to two hours, Maker would be safe with no losses. The larger concern lies in how much of the over collateral value vault owners would lose if bits were delayed. Respectfully, we showed the other side. If we were to make auctions longer, vault owners and Maker would be exposed to additional market risk. There is a trade-off. However, according to the feedback, we haven\u2019t seen any larger objections, which means we\u2019ll propose a similar set of parameters for ETH and renBTC vaults tomorrow. This was one of the primary reasons for the vote. We want to clear this out before we proceed to implement auction parameters for ETH and renBTC. I also want to note that there\u2019s another reason to propose the same set of parameters of ETH and renBTC for LINK and YFI; we may not want to create disorder between Keepers when they set up their software to bid in this initial testing phase. It is better to have all parameters unified. If we observe auctions running smoothly with high participation, we may propose adjustments. The only parameter where we said we\u2019re going to make some changes is the ilk haul, which is the number of pending auctions per particular collateral asset. There was a debate concerning increasing the surplus buffer with the Lerp module. We may hit it in about eight days or sooner if we have some liquidations. I suggested enabling it this week because of the issue Chris mentioned. If we have a large liquidation event in front of us, we could collect millions in fees. There are about $400,000 from stability fees daily, and this would all go into the burner on the same day. I suggested increasing the surplus buffer tomorrow. Finally, we looked into peg stablecoin vault usage, which has increased within the last week. On-chain liquidity for peg has become so poor that people are using the vault to farm with Dai. Maker doesn\u2019t charge any stability fee on PAX.  LongForWisdom: Thank you Primoz, anyone has any risk-related questions? We see the DAO on main vaults increasing, especially on ETH-A. How risky is this? Primoz: With Liquidations 2.0, it\u2019s much less risky. We still need to see how they perform. I\u2019m very optimistic. Also, most of the risk is related to liquidity. Because ETH price went higher, this risk is getting lower. LongForWisdom: Given that we\u2019re not guaranteed to see liquidations before the point where we vote on ETH-A and wBTC for Liq 2.0, are we going to wait until we confirm that things are working with LINK and YFI before pushing Liq 2.0 to ETH-A? Brian: I would love that. We are now working on this governance schedule that is not an all-inclusive design, so maybe that\u2019s a question that we could ask the broader audience. Can we wait? I think there\u2019s a lot of concern that there will be some large market drawdown within the next month or two. I want to time the market, but it depends on whether you want Liq 2.0 in place before or after that.   Wouter: We can easily test Liquidations 2.0 on the mainnet. It\u2019ll cost a bit of money, but we can open a vault, meet our risk, and liquidate it.  Brian: Anyone can do that. I won\u2019t be the one. Wouter: Come on, Brian, with the current MKR price, it shouldn\u2019t be an issue, right? Brian: Not happening, Wouter, sorry. Seb: It will cost more to first have Liquidations 2.0 and then potentially fail, causing to delay Liquidations 2.0 and lose $100 million.   Derek: We\u2019ve discussed doing some mainnet tests with the integrations team just to test the Keepers, the system, and the UIs that we\u2019ll have in place coming down the line. I think that\u2019s a good idea for us to do. I can work with integrations and communicate to guys regarding our plan.  LongForWisdom: Sounds good, thanks all.     Real-World Finance Team Update  Sebastien Derivaux 31:00  Regarding NewSilver, we have our first investment in RWAs toward Dai. It worked. I want to thanks the SC and Centrifuge team. We had a nice piece on Coindesk. We had some PR activities, so that\u2019s always good. People can see that Maker is always innovating, so we innovated with Uniswap LPs early this year now with RWAs. On the other RWAs but mainly on the ones based on the trust solution, we\u2019re still waiting for Matthew to release the last pieces on the 6S collateral. We\u2019re making progress with SolarX and Renault because they work together to find the best solution. They\u2019re exploring all solutions based on collateral agents stuff like that, and thanks to Christian, who\u2019s helping us a lot. We\u2019re preparing for the next batch of RWAs, which will be after liquidations 2.0 and after delegation because there are very important. But we\u2019re working on one batch of collateral Centrifuge assets making more than one collateral in one executive for Centrifuge because those are just copy-pasted collaterals, and we\u2019ve less visibility on trust-based collaterals SolarX and Renaults. I think 6S will be there quite soon. On these, we\u2019ve one deadline for Solar Farms that should be done by the end of June because they need the financing, equity the sellers because those are the properties they buy to the farmers we can\u2019t wait for farmers to wait for years they don\u2019t have strategic passions so we\u2019re putting in place to present it may be next week.  LongForWisdom: I saw some of the documents from 6S posted on the forum. Any updates on those? It was delayed this week, but we have a law firm called Arnold & Porter LLP. They have partners in New York who worked on a lot of asset-backed securities. All those criteria legends trust them to help us on this, so we need to have everything in place. So there is a lot to read on the legal side of things. Matthew: I encourage the review, and I do encourage the community to appreciate the notion that all of the transactions come with a legal opinion to ensure enforceability because legal opinions are what the community, I, and as well as trust companies are relying on upon.   Frank: Matt, you mentioned that the new trust company would review the transactions. Can you quickly review that? I am referring to the blockchain making sure that DAI is moving from one contract to another.  Matthew: The piece that they are going to monitor is the liquidation status of the given vault, the debt outstanding, and the DC to govern largely their decision making with regards to whether or not additional credit can be extended or how funds get returned or if vault needs to be liquidated. They aren\u2019t participating on whether DAI has been drawn or DAI has been returned per se. Instead, it engages in how they handle as the trustee over the trust. Frank: How did they overcome that because? They might have initially hesitated. Matthew: Strategic patience. In general, it is a big picture. We trust the \u2018trust,\u2019 and we trust the trustee; That\u2019s the notion of it. There is a credit agreement that would be executed between LendCO and the trust. Transactions that would fall within the scope of the credit agreement are things that could be lent against from the trust to LendCO; otherwise, it won\u2019t extend credit.     Operational Support Update  Amy Jung 39:39  The Know your MIP Direct Deposit module is coming up next week. We also have collateral onboarding; we have MCO2, which involves carbon footprint. That\u2019ll be next Wednesday as well. Lastly, we had a few launch pod series Governance Communications and Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling. I want to remind you that we have completed our first series of RWA, their team, and their work. We had Bitwage last week, which involves payroll invoicing. We also have Request Network tomorrow. They are eager to have core unit facilitators interested in using their products. Regarding intentional organization and what we can do to communicate better in the DAO; We\u2019re perpetually growing, and communication is an important and challenging aspect of any community. Please, leave some ideas here.  LongForWisdom: Are there updates on the SES or SCS progress? Juan: Yesterday, we had a presentation with the community where we presented what we\u2019re trying to achieve and how we plan to do it. We\u2019re looking forward to your feedback. We would like to get everything set up for the next round. If you can read the MIP, we would appreciate it.    Operational Support Weekly Update: March 22- 24, 2021 ",

This includes core units for content production, growth, critical engineering, and the Swag Shop. There\u2019s a Declaration of Intent proposal for Euro-DAI along with several amendments to various MIPs, including MIP4, MIP9 and MIP0. MIP0 amendments are minor. MIP4 amendments are a little more involved but not groundbreaking. MIP9 amendments are only setting it for green light polls twice a month rather than once a month. We\u2019ll also be doing some of the budget distributions on Monda. We will begin with Protocol Engineering and try to get to the other core units as well. However, I will need to speak to them first. Make sure to look for that on Monday.   Open Discussion  End Book Fixes  LongForWisdom 48:40  LongForWisdom: Do anyone from the Smart Contracts team want to speak about the end book fixes?  Kurt: There\u2019s a detailed forum post about this. Along with the Liquidations 2.0 spell that was recently voted in were some bug fixes concerning the ESM and the end module, which is the smart contract that orchestrates the global settlement process after an emergency shutdown. In the process of scrutinizing them, we had found issues with the ESM. It didn\u2019t revoke the access of Governance to certain aspects of the system. A quick overview: the ESM is used to dump a certain amount of MKR and shut down the system. The primary intent of it is to allow an honest minority to defend against malicious majority within Governance. Another usage will be if there\u2019s were a critical bug in the system that can\u2019t be safely patched. Some minority of MKR holders could be notified and safely shut things down. It didn\u2019t work very well for the first intent of defending against a malicious majority because there was still access for governance to retain the system. The fix was to completely shut Governance out if the ESM were to get triggered. If there is a bug in the emergency shutdown process itself that Governance could intervene and repair turns out to be the exact kind of bug that we had at the end; if there was a certain amount of collateral reserved to cover Dai, and it exceeded a particular value you\u2019d get an overflow. The end process would get stuck. Governance could have stepped into for repair, but we changed the ESM to shut Governance out completely. The fix was relatively quick. It took longer to write the forum post explaining this than it did to fix the issue.   LongForWisdom: Risk spoke about future mitigations to pick up these sorts of bugs. Would you like to summarize those?  Kurt: there will be fully detailed post mortems at some point within the near future. Unfortunately, we\u2019re a little bit oversubscribed at the moment. I don\u2019t want to make false promises. The ESM bug was caught by discussing how it worked while we were looking to redeploy it. Originally, there wasn\u2019t a good enough specification for the ESM. It was around the time that the system was first being deployed. The Governance system wasn\u2019t well defined or finalized. The lesson is that we require better specifications upfront for the requirement of these things. Of course, we can add test coverage for that, which we now have. The end big was caught now because we were writing tests to perform the emergency shutdown process with the LINK-A executive applied. By performing those tests, we saw they were getting stuck, not working, and reverting. Kurt: But how can we find these bugs sooner? We have a few different things we want to do. We want continuous integration tests that are running all the time or periodically against the mainnet state. We could catch the bug as soon as we have more than a certain amount of DAI from ETH-A, for example. We could have added formal verification where you say \u2018here are the expected magnitudes for values in the system\u2019 and then run an automated checking tool that says confirm the intermediate calculations overflow and revert if the magnitudes are in those expected ranges. That\u2019s another thing we want to do. Generally, we\u2019d love to be spending more time on security and safety work. There\u2019s been a big road map published for that that you could find on the forum as well. We could use these issues to invest more into upstream activities instead of pushing everything out at once.   LongForWisdom: Awesome, thank you for summarizing that. I like the idea of having a sandbox running and constantly shutting down the protocol to make sure everything works.  Kurt: it would be running against the current state and values on the mainnet. Somebody may ask if the emergency shutdown was tested before? Well, it was tested extensively, even on the mainnet. This bug only surfaced when we had a certain amount of collateral in the system. all those tests were done with too small values to trigger the bug. That\u2019s why continuous integration tests can help discover it as soon as it happens. It\u2019s not ideal since you do have to find it on the mainnet. These solutions are not complete. We need this more intensive and frequent early checking within the dev process where you write tests or do some verification using a wide range of values to look for problems anywhere in these specified ranges.   LongForWisdom: I think that makes a lot of sense. Any other questions?  Christopher Mooney: We have a full response to the MIP45 audits posted in the forums today authored by Kurt. We took a little while to collect our thoughts. Kurt did a good job at describing each issue in the audit and how they were addressed. It\u2019s a very comprehensive response. Kurt: In the audits, there were no super severe bugs that were found. There were potentially two or three that were fairly significant. These were fixed. Most of the issues were either minor, informational, or simply remarks on design aspects of the system, such as how we do authorizations or conventions. There were also good ones that were brought up concerning the risks of MEV to the Liquidations 2.0 system. LongForWisdom: I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to find time to read it. Kurt: Let us know whether your issue was addressed or potentially what does the issue even means. They refer to very detailed things about the system. Hopefully, this will help anyone who wants to understand the audit reports.     Delegation  LongForWisdom 1:00:45  I posted a thread on the forum concerning delegation. In summary, delegation is coming fairly soon. People volunteered to be delegated. Gov Alpha and I are reaching out to interested people. We are discussing best practices and creating a collaborative set of goals.  Payton: A concern that sprouts within the discussion of the delegation are the potential for one person or entity to be able to retain all the voting power all while everyone else is content and thereby allowing this person to become malicious. Do we have any practical limitations in mind or anything related? SamM: This person would have to maintain the voting power for two days to secure the hat. Delegators will be made aware of this to allow them to pull their MKR to reverse their vote. This is not a critical scenario but concerning.   LongForWisdom: Does Dss Gov change this because it works off a snapshot system?  Kurt: It\u2019s unknown if Dss Gov will ship in its current form, but we spent a lot of time discussing mechanisms regarding delegation expiry time to prevent delegates from misbehaving or becoming apathetic. These mechanisms are put in but do require to be revisited and reviewed. Christopher Mooney: It\u2019s a problem. We tried to address it in Dss Gov. However, the type of delegation we will have here is a minimum viable implementation of delegation. We are hacking up a voting proxy to allow for delegation. SamM: We don\u2019t have any vote decay implemented at the moment because we don\u2019t need it. We are redoing the delegation when Dss Gov releases. That will be sufficient. Christopher Mooney: I can imagine scenarios where it doesn\u2019t work. However, I agree that it is most likely that we move to Dss Gov and perform the best implementation. Does anybody object? Frank Cruz: Is decaying similar to slashing in POS? Christopher Mooney: At a certain threshold, the delegator\u2019s delegation will eventually become ineffective and require re-up through participation in the protocol. This prevents early delegates from being apathetic or monopolizing locked or lost MKR. LongForWisdom: I hope that we will have an initial set that will help avoid everyone piling into a single delegate. We will be able to keep MKR distributed between delegates through the delegate\u2019s quality. Overall, we will have to experience this through practice. Brian McMichael: The Protocol Engineering team has no intention of being delegates because that can be an issue of power.   Frank Cruz: Are any core unit members will be delegates?  Christopher Mooney: It\u2019s permissionless. Anybody could put their name forward, but it would be a poor idea for MKR holders to delegate due to potential power concerns for the delegator. Kurt: Somebody can go and mix my MKR and make it untraceable, come back with a pseudo identity, and convince MKR holders to delegate to them. This is a realistic possibility. LongForWisdom: We are planning for Gov Alpha to perform delegate verification. It won\u2019t be anything forceful, but there will be communication involved between these people. Verified delegators can receive a checkmark status or something like that. Kurt: That sounds like a good place to start. Delegates will evolve, and anything can happen in the future. We may have much more comprehensive investigational capabilities in the DAO or something. These are crazy ideas, but who knows.   Peyton: I know the SES Core Unit presentation mentioned a vision involving parties as delegates. Does anybody have opinions on this?  Wouter: There are three models that we discussed. These are three bottlenecks for scalability. We are trying to develop a vision of what things may evolve into. We have a decentralized workforce and capital allocation. One of the issues we are addressing is that MKR holders have limited bandwidth. As the ecosystem scales, you can expect MKR holders to continue getting involved in the nitty-gritty and micromanage every little thing. On the other end, there will be much involved in understanding which work needs to be funded in the DAO based on importance. We will also check the quality of every Team\u2019s work. Finally, we are concerned with the potentially coming need to have a budget limit. Currently, our budget is like a buffet as we are adding on tasty core units, and it may look like there is no limit, but sooner or later, it will happen. Then we will need to know how to prioritize core units and the DAO budget. The idea is to have a limit set for groups who develop their vision and priorities for the DAO. We can have people who work to focus on budget allocation for these goals within the budget limit. This is a very compatible and scalable idea. However, delegation is the first step. I am excited to create more documentation discussing how these ideas can evolve in the future. Please, listen to our launch-pod session here.

I\u2019m the MakerDAO governance facilitator. My name is LongForWisdom. As always, we\u2019ve got a little bit of an agenda to get through. We have some general updates and then get into the discussion. Feel free to interrupt and talk or ask questions. We want to hear from you. So please, don\u2019t be shy to contribute. As mentioned previously, the meeting time has changed to 17:00 UTC, which will continue going forward. Another advantage of this meeting being one hour later is that I can now tell you the poll results on this meeting because the results will be available. Alright, let\u2019s move into weekly updates. I  prepared a governance update today, separately from Governance at a Glance:  For this week, we had inclusion polls for seven proposals; all but one of those passed. I believe the only one not to pass was the declaration of intent for the Maker Protocol Insurance cover from Nexus Mutual. The others passed. We had two Oracle related polls; whitelisting SetProtocol on multiple Oracles and whitelisting Gnosis on multiple Oracles. We had an onboarding call for the UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH liquidity pool token, which also passed. We had the rates proposal, which passed 70K. I was impressed to see that much. We also saw 70k on the inclusion poll for CropJoin. This gives us some idea of the popularity of that with Maker holders. We saw an increase in the system Surplus buffer poll pass. Adjusting the flap auction parameters passed based on last week\u2019s discussions. We saw investigating the implementation of the WBTC-B vault type with a lower liquidation ratio also pass. That will be added to the collateral sheet soon, and we\u2019ll see some of these other changes in the executive tomorrow.   In terms of what Governance has been going on. My main focus for the last while has been onboarding, specifically Prose11 and Eli. That process seems to be going reasonably well so far. I\u2019m looking forward to getting both of them more heavily involved. You may not have seen Eli too much yet, but he will be around a lot more in February. In general, Governance is going well. Maintenance tasks, by which I mean running this meeting, running polls each week, running the executive each week, is taking up most of my time, meaning some things have been slipping. These include writing the documentation I\u2019ve been talking about, parameter docs, and reviewing stuff other people are writing. I\u2019m confident that Prose and Eli coming on will help mitigate the difficulty. Therefore, I\u2019m not too worried at this stage. David Utrobin and Charles St.Louis have continued to take the lead on the MIPs work. The process is working reasonably well. We\u2019ve recently been planning to work on a MIPs portal. This portal will allow the community to more easily access and navigate around MIPs. Juan is leading that project, and we\u2019ll have more to share about it soon. I\u2019m not quite at the point where we have anything concrete to present, but that should be coming soon. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Updates Payton Rose Governance at a Glance 02:40 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated. Three-Point Summary:  This week\u2019s market volatility brought some liquidations, with total DAI supply falling off an ATH to 1.4B. The PSM\u2019s demand brings the new vault type to its DC, with plenty of room still available for legacy USDC-A vaults. The DAI VWAP for last week was very strong, with most trades between $0.999-1.002.  Discussions   Adjusting the BOX Parameter  OneBiteLawnOrder brings a valuable discussion surrounding increasing the box Parameter given the currently large DC of ETH vaults. We may want to reevaluate the size of the box Parameter    What happens if DAI loses it\u2019s peg and goes to $2 for example?  BlueCat questions how the system protocol reacts to a severe swing in DAI price. If DAI were to lose its PEG, how would that affect liquidity pools and price?    Creating a Bite-Rebate Contract for Keepers Acting on Small Vaults  I posted an informal poll forwarding an idea by yaronvel from B.Protocol, who provided some preliminary code that could rebate the gas fees incurred by calling \u201cbite\u201d on smaller vaults.    Signal Requests   Increasing Dust Parameter  Monet-supply signals an increase to the Dust Parameter (minimum DAI debt) above 500 DAI in light of high gas prices discouraging keepers from calling \u201cbite\u201d on smaller vaults.    Debt Ceiling Adjustments, 11th Jan 2021   Primoz signals new Debt Ceilings in light of some recent Signal Requests and evolving risk management.    Rolling out the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM)  LongForWisdom signals rolling out DC-IAM for current and future vaults given the passing of MIP27, which is the debt ceiling instant access module. We are currently taking the same actions for ETH-B, which has been successful.    Interim DAO Operating Budget  Hexonaut proposes an interim budget for the Autonomous MakerDAO working Group to cover expenses such as the first PSM audit. Polling ends 2021/01/19.   Payton: There are still a few ongoing projects, and people looking for help as well. So check out the Governance at a Glance post and follow those links. Thanks.  LongForWisdom: Thank you very much, Prose. That pretty much covers Governance at a Glance. Tim, you had just asked how much more participation we need for DC. I am pushing for more people to respond because it is only five days long, and there were less than 30 when I had checked. Usually, I would like to see at least 30. But as you say, given that no one is voting \u201cNO,\u201d we\u2019ll probably extend it to next week even if we don\u2019t see more than 30.    Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 09:50  As Long mentioned earlier, we had two Oracle proposals pass. They were for about five different Oracles a piece. Those were, I believe, SetProtocol and Gnosis. It\u2019s encouraging to see that after having been longtime customers, they\u2019re trying to expand, and the first people they look to for Oracle\u2019s is MakerDAO. We\u2019re building some customer loyalty there. That\u2019s great to see. On the Starkware side, DYDX has a pending proposal for 17 Oracle\u2019s with the catch that they want them on L2. They don\u2019t want them on Mainnet. Production on this is underway. We expect to have their release deployment in testing by the end of this week. Then, after about two weeks of testing, I think we would feel pretty comfortable to begin deployment. The deployment will align with the launch date that DYDX has planned for its new platform. We also have some leads, courtesy of Lev, for some auditing firms with the Uniswap LP Oracle. The smart contracts team, Amy, and I will be meeting with these firms next week to discuss the scope and terms. They indicated that they would have time starting at the beginning of February, which is much earlier than I can guarantee you any other auditing firm would have taken on such a project. If we can get the audit done during the first half of February and then implement any of the changes they cite, we could be looking at raising debt ceilings on the LP Oracle on any of the LP tokens by the end of February. That\u2019ll be huge! On that note, there was a forum signal request to raise the DC on the DAI-ETH-A LP token. The community voted that they wanted a 12 million DC. However, Primoz and I believed that setting the debt ceiling that high in one go is quite a significant risk. We\u2019re not super confident yet about the new LP token Oracle code. The fact that we launched this at the end of December and nothing terrible has happened yet, means our confidence has increased. Therefore, we are prepared to get more exposure to the LP token Oracle, just not quite 12 million as of yet. Primoz and I think that the direction to go here is not necessarily to raise the debt ceiling on DAI-ETH-A. Instead, we believe it may be more effective to onboard some of the other large LP tokens like USDC-ETH and WBTC-ETH; giving those a low 3 million debt ceiling, and that way, we set ourselves up for success. Hopefully, during February, all that\u2019s left will be to crank up the dial on the debt ceilings pending a successful audit. That is a better plan rather than trying to jack up the DAI-ETH debt ceiling right now. We can then begin adding more LP tokens, which will take a month. However, we recognize that the community wants to use DAI-ETH because the debt ceiling has been full since day one.  Questions  Lucas: Nick, do you have an update on the New Silver 2 Oracle assessment? If we\u2019re still aiming for the 29th governance spell, it would need to be out this week, right? Nick: Yes, I\u2019m still on track with that. I\u2019m hoping to have it out by Sunday. Lucas: Thank you.  Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 15:59  We have been in audits and all over the liquidations 2.0 codebase. I think everyone would agree that liquidations 2.0 is probably our top priority right now. This week, we kicked it off with PwC, who\u2019s auditing us. We have a kickoff with QuantStamp afterward. We worked on MIP21 this week. We\u2019re hoping to have it in Kovan by Wednesday. However, MIP21 is still missing unit tests. We\u2019re hoping to get those unit tests in before putting it to Kovan. So, I think MIP21 is going to slip at this point. Right now, all the tests we have are working; it looks like we\u2019re 99.5% of the way there. We\u2019ve almost got MIP 21 ready to go, which will then segue into MIP22. MIP 22 has been doing a pretty good job. They\u2019ve already got a bunch of tests. I need to cycle back and see if we\u2019ve gotten feedback on the original MIP22 and whether or not all of that feedback was addressed. We want to lift some of the tests that we have for both MIP21 and MIP22. In summary, we\u2019re working on them, and as I said, with a higher priority being Liquidation 2.0 as it comes along. As far as other collaterals, I think Emilio ended up working on the LP Uniswap V2 LP for USDC-ETH. That\u2019s ready for Kovan. Tanner and I started working on the LP tokens for FWBTC. I think we\u2019re optimistic that next both those LP tokens will be available next Friday. Aside from that, I don\u2019t have any of the other usual stuff. I can talk a lot concerning smart contracts. But we\u2019re swamped over here, and things are going well.  Discussion and Comments  Brian McMichael: I want to jump in and add that concerning the Real World Asset adapters, we\u2019ve got MIP21 and MIP22. These are two Real World Asset proposals, but with very different approaches. Suppose we want to scale RWA to any length right now. In that case, we can put these bespoke adapters on there and add these real-world adapters. If people are going to integrate dashboards, and backstop protocols, and things like that, we need to find a way to standardize these adapters if we hope to scale up. This means we will be reviewing MIP22 once we finish up MIP21 and see what efficiencies are presented by bringing these two together. Ideally, we\u2019d like to get to a point where we can kick these things off like we kick off standard collateral. But right now, we\u2019ve got this very bespoke process that\u2019s not scalable at all. Give us a little more time to work on that. We had to hold the red card up this week because of the unit tests on MIP21. The team probably isn\u2019t going to have time to work on those unit tests. I think some other community actors, namely, Will or Lev, or maybe, Sam\u2026 there are contract funds available to take care of that if you guys want to get that out. Thanks. Lucas: I have one thing to say about MIP22. Seven MIP6 proposals want to use MIP22 or any improved version of it if we improve along the way. Hopefully, we can get to some scale there. That\u2019s the idea.  Chris: Yeah, MIP22 will be reusable for all of those. It will hold the same sort of format and style. What we\u2019ll do is to take the lessons we learned from MIP21 and 22 and come up with a circuit proposal. This will be an overall \u201cgeneric\u201d MIP that will work for most real-world assets. We can use that template and knock these things out. Lucas: I have one question I thought might be interesting for the Governance community. I know we don\u2019t concern ourselves too much with Kovan. But how is the Maker test instance managed in Kovan? Who\u2019s doing something with it? Are there several? What\u2019s the testing process? Also, I couldn\u2019t find any information online concerning the people that want to test with it. Brian: I can chime in here. If you go to changelog.makerdao.com, there is a Kovan branch track where you can see all of our addresses on Kovan. We have internal teams and tech op teams that use it, especially with new collateral types. They need to test out Oasis and make sure that everything works. I don\u2019t know how to work with RWAs because they\u2019re authorized liquidation processes. But yeah, we do use those internally. We have a tech ops team that maintains it. This will be an interesting discussion to have with the community at some point. Lucas: Yeah, but who is the authority on the hat? Who\u2019s the authority in that system? Chris, Our smart contracts team has enough MKR to Kovan MKR for voting. We\u2019re MKR whales, at least somewhere. What will happen is when MIP22 is ready to lead up to the executive where we would want to push it to mainnet, Will has built the entire spell for it. The MIP22 stuff will lift all of the integration tests you\u2019ve written, all that code, and we\u2019ll put it into this one Kovan spell, which mirrors the spell that we\u2019ll make in the mainnet. We\u2019ll do a heavy review on that. Any other changes we make will be pushed into the chief. Then, we have the same type of keeper that manages mainnet is managing casting stuff in Kovan. It\u2019ll lift it and then cast it. At this point, we can live-test it with Kovan. If you want to see how it integrates with the system, now, the only way to do that is deploy a separate instance of MCD in Kovan or deploy it on a test net. You can use DSS deploy scripts to do that. But that\u2019s probably a lot of engineering work that I wouldn\u2019t do. It\u2019s up to you guys if you want to do some pre-testing or test net. I hope this answers your question. Lucas: I think we\u2019ll skip integration testing. Thankfully, we can use our PC testing for mocking out, giving ourselves enough MKR to manipulate Kovan and mainnet DSS, so that\u2019s fine. I think we\u2019re getting too much into the technical details. Thanks for answering. Chris: Sam pointed out one correction, which is that next week is the community executive. That means that the week after will be the executive that we work on. LongForWisdom: I would say we\u2019re still trying to figure out what we should put in the community executive. And whether we should put some of the regularly scheduled stuff in there. I don\u2019t think we know for sure what\u2019s going to go on that. But it might include the Uni LPs and stuff, or it might not.   Matthew Rabinowitz: Chris, just for clarity. The target for MIP21 is next week?  Chris: I think it\u2019s going to slip from that target because we want to have it in Kovan the week before. Let\u2019s cycle back and see if we can get someone to write the unit tests for MIP21. It\u2019s looking good.   Chris: I had a question about Governance. I had brought up and then didn\u2019t have the time to make the post about removing the moms from the stablecoins so that you can\u2019t instantaneously circuit break the moms. Is that in the Governance process?  LongForWisdom: It is now because I had forgotten about it until this point. If you want to write up the posts or something about it, you can write a blog post saying what it is and why we\u2019re doing it. I can put it on a list for tomorrow\u2019s exec. That\u2019s assuming you guys are ready to do it tomorrow. Otherwise, we can also do it next week. Chris: Yeah, we can do it tomorrow. I\u2019ll see if I can get to that today. LongForWisdom: To summarize. We want to remove permissions for the liquidations mom to allow liquidations to be activated for stablecoins without waiting for the DS-Pause to unlock.   Brian: I would like to bring up one more smart contract; It\u2019s mentioned in the sidebar. We intend to have a community executive with the community writing their spell. I want to point out that the smart contracts team does intend to review this spell except for anything that we cannot review for specific reasons. So, please, keep that in mind. We intend to review the community spell that\u2019s going out next week, and we will comment on it. But this will be the first community crafted and organized spell, which is exciting.  LongForWisdom: I mean, technically, we sort of did one the first time, but yeah, it\u2019s the first time it will be formally integrated into the process.    Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 27:45  We don\u2019t have a considerable amount of updates this week. We\u2019re mostly working on risk modeling and valued risk calculations. There will be a related post by Andy following shortly. We published the tBTC evaluation that was mentioned last week. I have also made two signals this week. One is for debt ceiling changes, and the other is for flap auction adjustments. Flap auction adjustments won\u2019t be effective because there was a confirmed vote to increase the surplus buffer to 10 million. However, I still think everybody agrees that flap auction adjustments were needed. Regarding our proposed debt ceiling adjustments, I hope more people can vote on it because we\u2019re still low on votes. Nevertheless, I think a broader discussion should be held regarding whether we should make a group that will be more agile and reactive to the debt ceiling changes than what we currently have. This would be beneficial. The current environment is more volatile, but debt ceilings changes are associated with rate changes, so we may want to have this included in the same group that manages rates. A broader discussion needs to happen if the community prefers this. I also think that fewer debt ceiling changes will be required if we start implementing an instant access module for other vault types. We may need to configure parameters for the instant access module itself. I think the group could be beneficial here. I also want to mention another signal vote for the dust parameter. The current winning vote is 2000 DAI, which means the dust increases from 500 DAI to 2000 DAI. If nothing changes until tomorrow within the signal poll, there will be a new dust value next week. Other than that, I\u2019m mostly involved in regular risk analysis work. I\u2019m also planning to start a simplified version of the budget proposal for risk. A similar proposal to the one Sebastian recently released. In order for the Risk Team to be compensated by the DAO and also to communicate more clearly from our side about the team vision regarding the risk domain and the milestones that we want to achieve. That\u2019s all for our side.  LongForWisdom: Thank you for that. I want to come back to the point you made about folding-in the DC changes with the rates group. We should talk about this more because I don\u2019t want us to end up in a situation where we start centralizing one group\u2019s power, right. Or at least if we are doing that, we are clear about why we are doing it. We should discuss how we could remove that barrier in the future. I want to remind people of some things. The rates group is writing a MIP that will help govern what that rates group does. This MIP will potentially make it possible for multiple rates groups. This would mean that we may see competing proposals if someone or some group wanted to set up an alternative group. I\u2019m more comfortable with this because that will safeguard the decentralization rather than keeping it fixed to one group.    Amy Jung Community Development Team Update 32:26  I was working a little more within the community development side during this week. We don\u2019t have too many updates for this call. However, I do want to mention that we now have the Maker Relay in audio form. If you\u2019re going to listen to it, feel free to share that link with anyone who wants to know what\u2019s happening in Maker these days. We did want to mention that in December, we had 13 events of community meetups. We\u2019re still going strong on those. Feel free to join if there are people interested in attending the meetups. It\u2019s always a good opportunity.  Operational Support Update 33:14  I do want to give the classic disclaimer that I am still an employee of the Foundation. There\u2019s a limitation of things that I could work on or lead. I\u2019m a little bit less flexible about what my dream operational support role is. Nonetheless, I\u2019m lucky to be working very closely with Juan. He\u2019s a core component of why he should be a facilitator on the team with me. The Autonomous MakerDAO working group is clearing through a lot of work, which is awesome. Therefore, most of what I\u2019m doing is coordination. I just want to remind people that we don\u2019t get to evangelize many of the things that I see the community working on. But there\u2019s so much happening. The DAO is growing at a swift pace. I\u2019m focusing on administration stuff such as paying out grantees and things like that and working a lot on recruiting and onboarding. It\u2019s a unique situation to recruit for the DAO because we have a much more structured onboarding process than in a regular organization. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of one-on-one onboarding for contributors and grantees. We get a sense of what that experience might look like in a DAO form. There are a few areas in identifying to get better at actively signaling some of the needs that I see in the community. We are looking for people in the community to lead some of these areas. Nick mentioned an independent audit security team. I think that\u2019s a huge aspect of coordinating and leading audits. If someone has experience in security and things like that, please speak to me. Written descriptions of these will soon be available in the forum. Concerning the legal domain, there are a few people that I am speaking with who are interested in contributing to the legal side coming soon as well. This kind of HR function revolves around recruiting, hiring, and potentially something such as compensation guidance that I think we\u2019re probably going to get into in the next few weeks. There are also master lists that I had mentioned as a resource for knowing all the projects and what\u2019s happening. When you look at what Yearn has, the joke I made is that it has roughly ten projects on their website, and we have 90. That means it\u2019s not as easy for us to state everything that\u2019s happening, who\u2019s organizing it, and what\u2019s active or inactive. It\u2019s going to be a pretty big master resource. Also, David, LongForWisdom, and I are working on writing emergency process procedures. That\u2019s a significant intake that we\u2019re going to have by mid-February, hopefully. There\u2019s a lot of pieces coming towards it. One point that I did see in the forum, to clarify right now, is that many pieces have to do with the difference between interim solutions and longer-term solutions. There\u2019s a little hesitation when it comes to it. 100K, for example, the interim DAO budget, should be thought of as smaller steps growing into something larger. I don\u2019t know how clear that is to everyone. Some teams are working on the longer-term and more structured ways of thinking about how the DAO will operate. This is not just on the operational side. Things are coming that are only interim, and therefore it may be proposed as such. I\u2019m helping craft the communications around this so that these things are clear to everybody.  LongForWisdom: Great, thank you, Amy. I would also echo that as well, especially the part regarding interim solutions versus long term solutions. A lot of the stuff we\u2019re doing in the interim is not things we would want to do long-term. Please don\u2019t consider the interim things to be permanent or things that we should be doing permanently.    ",

I\u2019ve been working with different groups on several fronts, and hopefully, we\u2019ll have more information next week. One of the topics is about decentralization; Anything that has to do with more permanent ways of being decentralized and organizing the whole thing. Long already mentioned in the tools section that one of these topics is the MIPs portal. We\u2019re trying to build a UI that can help people navigate through the MIPs. Hopefully, we\u2019ll have an MVP soon. Then we can start playing with it and giving feedback and have a tool we can use to understand the MIPs and how to work with them. I\u2019m helping Peyton with the MIPs tracker. He\u2019s doing all the heavy lifting, but I\u2019m helping him to build a tool that mimics what we did for the collateral onboarding. That way, we can prioritize which MIPs we should focus on. This will help more clearly communicate to the community and help ourselves along with the different teams to understand what\u2019s missing. Concerning the collateral calls, we had a call yesterday with the xDAI team regarding the MIP6 application mistake. We also had Patricio from POAP, the Proof of Attendance Protocol, jump in, and explain why they moved to xDAI the call is already on YouTube. You can check it out on the MakerDAO YouTube channel. Next week, we have a Harbor Trade Credit. We\u2019ll have another real-world asset call. They were with us at the end of December. We\u2019ll have them again with Seb, Leia, and Lucas from Centrifuge. Same time on Wednesday. The following week, we\u2019ll have the team from Lido which are bringing staked ETH 2.0 back to ETH 1.0. There\u2019s a lot of questions for them as well. The agenda is coming soon. Anna from the snippets team, sorry for that. I don\u2019t have it yet.  LongForWisdom: Thank you, Juan. I\u2019m losing track of how many different meetings you are setting up, which is probably a good sign.    Charles St. Louis MIPs Update 41:25 2048\u00d71431 122 KB 2048\u00d71431 127 KB 2048\u00d71431 140 KB 2048\u00d71431 143 KB 2048\u00d71431 101 KB 2048\u00d71431 110 KB  Charles: That is my update for the MIPs. I do have another update; a little bit more of a bittersweet one. After two years of working at the Maker Foundation, I have officially left. My last day was this Tuesday. I will still be around in the community. I\u2019m still the MIP editor and will keep supporting Governance, MIPs RWA, and DAO initiatives. I just wanted to make this clear to everyone. Thanks.  LongForWisdom: Great, thank you, Charles. I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re sticking around in terms of the DAO. I would not like to have to handle the MIP stuff on top of the governance facilitator stuff.    Procedural LongForWisdom January MIPs Inclusion Review 46:50  LongForWisdom: Let me do the MIPs inclusion review. As Charles mentioned, all but one of the inclusion polls passed. I see no reason why the ones which passed cannot continue into the MIPs bundle poll on Monday. The one that did not pass was the declaration intent for Nexus Mutual insurance for the Maker protocol, which will not be included. It may be resubmitted in the future if the author wishes to do so.  Open Discussion 48:50  LongForWisdom: We have 20 minutes left if anyone wants to start a meaty discussion. We could briefly discuss onboarding, which Amy had mentioned. I had a conversation with Primoz about this before. Primoz, would you like to talk to speak about this briefly?  Primoz: There\u2019s not much to say. Most of my team consists of community members. When I see nice replies on forums, it\u2019s much easier to get in touch with them and then see if they cover the risk work. People who come to the forums know something about Maker, which could be quite complicated. I remember that we had tried tweeting out to get people to join the risk team at Maker sometime in the past. Some ambitious people applied. It\u2019s tough to start in the beginning. Things could be complicated, and working on risk could be challenging. It\u2019s much easier if people know about it because then we don\u2019t need to educate them. I feel great that community participation is growing on forums. For example, last week, there was a call about auctions. Andy made great insights, and he\u2019s going to hopefully help us with auction analytics, which is one of the angles that we\u2019ve been missing in the past. That\u2019s my impression about how to deal with such things. LongForWisdom:  Any other thoughts on this? Brian: I just wanted to say, welcome to the smart contract side. Decentralized engineering is very stressful. There\u2019s an orchestration that generally happens. We could work together to make this succeed, and I look forward to it! Welcome aboard, and we\u2019ll see you making that executive next week. I\u2019m excited about that. SamM: Thanks, I appreciate that. Long, could I run over the PSM? There have been some updates.   SamM: The PSM was filled out last week. This week, 1inch added the PSM as one of the liquidity providers. We\u2019ve started seeing some trades going through there via 1inch. They\u2019re pretty quick. Next week we\u2019ll be crafting the community executive. The plan is to increase the PSM debt ceiling to 80 million and attach a lerp module to increase it by an additional 33 million each week until reaching the 500 million target after 12 weeks. This is a nice balance between being cautious and moving towards the governance mandated goal. The UI will be ready soon as well.  LongForWisdom: Great, how have you found onboarding in terms of the smart contract stuff? Do you have any thoughts on what can make it difficult or easy? Chris: Careful, Sam, I\u2019m listening. SamM: It\u2019s been great a great experience so far. I love working with everybody on the team. I\u2019ve enjoyed getting more involved over the past several months. I\u2019m happy people enjoy the work that I\u2019m doing, and I\u2019m excited to do even more. Brian: We have weekly meetings focused on planning and things like that. I want to get you involved in those. It depends on your time, but we\u2019ll figure something out. SamM: I\u2019ll be there.   Amy: I also want to mention that one of the things working for us when you\u2019re hiring through a community. One of the principles is organic first. Instead of putting a job listing and people applying, you say here\u2019s some stuff that needs to be done, or people self identify and say this is the stuff that I think should be done, and then they do it. Sam is the master of that. If we want to continue, a lot of things that we\u2019ve been seeing which have been working are having something such as autonomous MakerDAO when we identify a few key areas and then can have people fill in their skillsets. Maybe once or twice, I\u2019ve seen where people\u2019s skillsets don\u2019t necessarily fit exactly, and we\u2019ve recalibrated a little bit. Sometimes you might see that, but usually, that\u2019s been working for us. It\u2019s like a slow and steady route rather than just bringing on people and having a formal recruiting committee. That\u2019s the state we\u2019re in right now.  LongForWisdom: This is something I\u2019ve noticed for a little while up until this point. We don\u2019t have a massive flood of people coming. Every month that passes, we pick up 1 or 2 intelligent and awesome people who stay. That\u2019s great to see because it shows that the protocol has power in terms of people enjoying working and wanting to stay. It\u2019s interesting how it evolves. It\u2019s good to see.   LongForWisdom: Any other questions? Feel free. Maybe it\u2019s worth mentioning some of the auction stuff again. It was a relatively significant part of last week\u2019s meeting. We saw the poll pass this week for updating the beg and the ttl for the flap auctions. We haven\u2019t seen it implemented yet, so we don\u2019t know how much of an effect it will have. Has anyone been following the auctions and have any idea on whether or not they\u2019ve gotten better or worse?  Chris: I was following the flap auctions. I had a conjecture last week. Due to gas prices, we weren\u2019t seeing people do the flap and then attend to take that initial bid. That\u2019s why we ended up in this sort of zero bid scenario. The gas prices fell significantly a few days ago. They weren\u2019t cheap, but they were around where they were a year ago. They were about 60 or 50 gwei, and all of a sudden, the zero bidding auction keeper and the other auction keeper that was participating when gas prices were low both came back and started flapping exactly how you\u2019d expect. That\u2019s a pretty clear signal that the beg is set too low for that type of behavior and high gas scenarios. LongForWisdom: That\u2019s good to hear. It\u2019s one of the things you end up keeping an eye on. Chris: Has has anyone put any thought into the idea of finding a community member that would be willing to bite liquidations for the rest of the auction types out there? We\u2019d end up reimbursing them for bites or giving them some amount of money to call bites or something like that, at least until we get to liquidations 2.0, where we have an incentive mechanism. LongForWisdom: This is similar to what B.Protocol was proposing. It\u2019s possible that they\u2019d be willing to run a bot to do that. They were talking about keeping low debt vaults below or near the dust limit. Maybe they\u2019d be willing. Chris: That\u2019s an excellent point. We could subsidize the dust.  SamM: I was going to say that this has become a bit of a problem. We require these altruistic bites. I\u2019m developing the PSM flipper as well, and currently, the design requires these altruistic biters. Like Brian is said, we need something like the keeper network or Dss Chron. We will need to address this more permanently. Brian: Liquidations 2.0 will essentially have direct governance controlled incentivization of barks? Will we be able to pay those out directly? It\u2019s the interim we need to be worried about and any new modules that don\u2019t conform to them. SamM: Right. Prose11: I know Yearns code from B.Protocol that he whipped up was essentially allowing a call of bite with rebate rather than bite and filling up a smart contract with some DAI to pay out those gas rebates. LongForWisdom: Essentially, a wrapper contract around the bite could be filled with DAI and provide rebates. SamM: That\u2019s what Dss-Chron does. It will provide these rewards for anybody that wants to call bite. Prose11: I like the idea, but it also seemed like a few people were willing to contribute DAI, which was neat and unexpected. B.Protocol was one of them. LongForWisdom: I think we need to get an idea about how much it would cost to subsidize what we want. If anyone is interested in investigating that more thoroughly, please do. Brian: If we\u2019re talking about filling up new roles, I think Chris brought it up last week. We need more of a product manager type of roll that works with front-end developers, smart contracts, documentation developers, and MIP editors to take care of a project for the full life cycle. We can add a new smart contract, but new developers can\u2019t come in and quickly get up to speed on it without the documentation. If it\u2019s not documented, integrators may decide it\u2019s not worth taking the time to integrate. Documentation is important. The UI is important. One of the things we realized on Black Thursday is that we didn\u2019t have a good UI for the auctions. We assumed people would come in and use them. Having someone who can facilitate all of the aspects around releasing a new item would be insanely beneficial. The Foundation takes care of this now. I want to toss it out there as an idea and an opportunity for someone to coordinate. LongForWisdom: That\u2019s a good point. We want to document all of these parameters. Brian: Every time we add a new adaptor or module on, somebody has to learn that when they come in, they need to get their head in the system. Whenever we add a new thing, if it\u2019s not streamlined, that\u2019s another cognitive overhead item. Documentation is essential, as well as accessibility for the community and integrators. LongForWisdom: Since we\u2019re talking about new roles, this reminds me of something that someone had posted on the forum. This was an informal poll asking whether MakerDAO should employ a recruiter who will go out and find people that we need to get certain things done. Tim Black: I think that can make onboarding easier. If you have clear expectations upfront, it is easier to sort and find people who could fill those things. LongForWisdom: That works better for some things than others. It works reasonably well for Governance and smart contracts. Amy: Many of the things that I\u2019ve been fielding regarding the interim solutions versus the long-term solutions is that the DAO can offer something like that. We\u2019re not a traditional company that offers XYZ. I\u2019ve had many conversations and set expectations in terms of getting to receive DAI. There are different ways you can coordinate that. It will also help once things are a little more decided on in the DAO. Then we could go ahead and be more active on it. I\u2019m very patient about it, but I think that\u2019s why being involved in these conversations is pretty important. It begins to set the benefits of working in the DAO.   LongForWisdom: That\u2019s important. There are many things that the DAO will initially have trouble dealing with in terms of benefits. We need to figure out what aspects of DAO employment are great and recognize some things we can\u2019t cover, and compensate for that in terms of salary loss. Working for the DAO is pretty cool in general. Anyway, it\u2019s time to wrap up.\u200b  Common Abbreviated Terms MCD: The Multi-Collateral Dai system CR: Collateralization Ratio DC: Debt Ceiling SF: Stability Fee DSR: Dai Savings Rate MIP: Maker Improvement Proposal OSM: Oracle Security Module RWA: Real-World Asset Credits  Anna Alexa K Produced this summary.

Forum at a Glance Forum at a Glance: October 7th - October 14th  Team-led Discussions  Dai Par - PSM Parameters  RWF, PECU and Risk Signal Request: Set PSM Fees to 0  SebVentures: The idea is to put at a peg where 1 DAI is always equal to 1 USD.  Most people still want to use USD as their unit of currency, which we should accept and allow to create this fixed peg. We are currently making users pay for the benefit of using DAI, which is not nice.   This should be fine and is not a technical issue from the PECU side. A conversation in this should be market participants moving to and treating DAI as Par.  While this is helpful for Maker, it introduces risk to other protocols.   PECU has spent a lot of time trying to reduce USDC exposure. This signal completely shifts that direction. There are many open-ended implications from setting the in/out to 0%.  The band is very tight; maybe we can set it a little higher. Is it worth fixing such a potentially detrimental issue when we can try to utilize it as a benefit instead?   In terms of the Clean Money initiative, we can convert the USDC into ESG bonds that are liquid enough to invest in Clean Money projects. Avoiding this or showing the public that we are not trying to show this is bad for MakerDAO PR.  USDC may undergo regulatory risk, which can create collateral damage to Maker.   We can externalize the risks here by using LP pools. However, there may be a small fee involved when converting to USD.   Governance Security and Flexibility: ESM + Delay parameters  Rune, Protocol Engineering, and Risk Restarted poll [Signal Request] Raise the ESM threshold to 15% and increase the Governance Delay to 4 days ESM:  Emergency Shutdown Module is a game theory mechanism that exists as a minority threat protection.  Used if a majority of MKR holders vote for something without popular consensus. Used during a malicious governance attack.   150,000 MKR seems like a large number considering how much MKR is being used now in governance. We do have an unknowable threshold considering empty or lost MKR.  If we set the ESM threshold too high, we lose the ability to trigger ES quickly enough.   LongForWisdom believes that 150,000 MKR may be a bit too high. There is potential for a profitable financial incentive to put MKR into ES if shorting MKR.  Or DAI can be bought at a discount below Par.   A very, very significant amount of capital would be required to complete and ES successfully.  Requires buying, borrowing, and accumulation of ETH.   Governance decisions should use MKR required to be in a wallet over a certain period of time.  GSM:  Governance Security Module delay gives more time to governance for solutions before pressing the \u2018Nuke\u2019 button of the ES. Response time to critical issues is usually within 24 hours.  a 2-day GSM is good enough already, if not too long. A 4-day GSM should still allow for a weekly governance cycle. We can propose a 3-day GSM to meet the middle-ground with everyone\u2019s opinions.   However, during a significant event like a market crash, 4 days is way too long. We should analyze and report some risks for the GSM comparing various days.  ",

We have our newly improved agenda, which will open to discussion around certain topics following our general updates.

Suppose you use a USDC or USDP as a stabilization mechanism. That\u2019s only until we depleted 3 billion USDC. So quite a liquidity buffer, the idea is to put it as an odd peg where one dollar would always be equal to one DAI of most of the time, but one DAI with no contractual guarantee whatsoever. Still the best effort, I would say by having the 3 million USDC waiving the possibility of depositing one USDC or one USDP or regulating Fiat back stablecoin into a PSM and getting one tiny change and use operators well. There are a lot of pros and cons. It\u2019s always better to have a fixed-term peg and, yes, last difference. That\u2019s part of the I think it was important that if there is some cost to go on to Dai or trade from Dai to another stablecoin, it\u2019s a customer. The Dai holder, at some point, was paying for them. So we are making your user pay for the benefit of choosing Dai, which doesn\u2019t make any sense.  15:28  SamM: Yeah, so I\u2019ll say just from the tactical side, I\u2019m not sure why P is listed here. Just from a purely technical standpoint, there\u2019s no issue, I think, with lowering this. But I believe that\u2019s the case.  15:51  Niklas Kunkel: I just want to echo what Sam said there. From a technical perspective, this is not an issue. So the PE Core Unit really can\u2019t have an opinion on this other than to tell you that there\u2019s no technical risk. Members have their personal views or opinions as MKR holders, but when they express them, they\u2019re just the opinions of those individuals.   Questions: 16:17  David Utrobin: I had a quick question. So with the PSM in out fees being zero, I think another part of this conversation is trying to move, you know, markets, participants, perception of Dai towards this idea that Dai can be treated at par. And I saw in the forums, some of the engineering team talks about how that might be a problem for some protocols to treat Dai at par, like hard coding values, rather than taking like, the actual floating rate on the market. And I\u2019m curious about that perspective. Should other protocols treat Dai as par? And yeah, that whole side of it.  16:58  Niklas Kunkel: That introduces risk for the other protocols. I guess, strictly speaking, it\u2019s helpful to Maker because it sort of enforces the peg in more places. If you imagine that, you\u2019re of a say, and you commit to always treating Dai as $1. And like collateral factor calculations, what if Dai like, actually depends significantly, all they could become, have some sort of solvency problem concerning that. That\u2019s a protocol by protocol, decision basis, for them to make based on maybe whatever benefits might be offered to them for making such a commitment, like partnerships with Maker. I think it\u2019s more like a financial risk question than anything.  18:09  Brian McMichael: I should probably jump in here and say I did have some posts on that topic. I will reiterate that those are my own opinions; they do come as a surprise to me in the fact that we\u2019ve been spending a good deal of time in PE with our priorities trying to reduce our USDC exposure, so consider that if you know USDC, were to change their implementation and become, KYC only, that could reduce the value of USDC on the market to under $1. And us choosing to peg to USDC, rather than to whatever the market price is, could have some considerations. I understand that there is the desire to take on as much of this as possible, to grow and expand by telling partners that we can provide USDC in exchange for these loans that they\u2019d be taking, but we don\u2019t have the solutions yet. So it\u2019s, in the meantime, we\u2019re just taking on piles of USDC. I disagree with the risk assessment that it would take 250 million USD to get to peg as we approach the peg value; the amount of USDC that we would have to take on increases almost exponentially to get down to that level. It\u2019s taken 3 billion USDC at this point to get down from, I think, an 800 million spread last year to a 250 million spread now. It seems like we might want to consider how we can get this USDC off the books and from a personal opinion from another personal standpoint. I think many Americans in the DAO are more concerned about the USDC risk than the non-Americans.  20:57  Makerman: Can I ask a technical question here? So we go to zero. Does this mean somebody can flash loan 100 million USDC out of the PSM, or is that technically impossible?  Niklas Kunkel: Yeah, they could flash loan Dai, purchase 100 million USDC and the PSM, and do something with, of course, they have to pay it back by the end of the transaction. Makerman: I just want to make a point that the idea of setting this to zero does have implications, many of which might be unintended. And so if anything, I would lead the leave the bottom side open, make, by basically, so Dai for a bit of bit above USDC, one, right? Don\u2019t bracket the zero to zero directly; leave if you want to think the band is tight enough, personally. Here\u2019s the question, what\u2019s the reasoning for actually going to zero? Because the band is insanely tight right now.    22:05  Niklas Kunkel: I can chime in here. Our growth is non-existent right now, or at least very poor compared to the growth of some of our competitors. You can utilize sucking in tons of USDC, which Dai will almost always have a premium for because of this. This is almost like yield farming premium compared to USDC. We can use this to bootstrap the DAI supply growth. All the USDC in the PSM is protocol owned; we can then just reallocate the USDC to wherever we want to reallocate it. You have some optimal mix of how you want to have the portfolio backing Dai. Just use the USDC in there to do that. You can be like, one Dai is one USDC, which is $1. Have we been like scheming for ways to get USDC off the books? Sure. Now you\u2019ve parked your money in those are you\u2019ve got the USDC off your books, you\u2019ve monetized it a little bit. The point entirely is to suck up as much USDC as we can, so we can use that as kind of a slingshot for the next steps.  25:01  Brian McMichael: I understand that. But like, we have 3 billion right now, right?  Niklas Kunkel: Even if you reduced it to 2 billion like you, we took all the efforts of the world, we tried to park USDC liquidity and everything in Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve and every single thing, you would never get it off your books, it would still be fatal. So if it\u2019s going to be fatal, regardless, let\u2019s at least get the benefit out of it.    25:55  Christopher Mooney: Yeah, I was anticipating the argument that this is, like, we already have a fatal amount of existential risk. I think that there\u2019s still a very real perception argument about whether or not Maker is attempting to risk balance its collateral portfolio. I think that\u2019s going to have a terrible consequence. For PR for people to be like, Maker is not even trying to solve this, and the other thing is, we don\u2019t have this, this capital sink that we want to stick this stuff into. The ESG bonds, or any of the real-world assets, we\u2019re still bootstrapping that; I don\u2019t disagree with the approach of trying to have this sort of capital battery; I don\u2019t think that we need to do it right this second, I believe that we can wait until we have until we start like flowing funds into these other projects.  27:21  Niklas Kunkel: I, so we fight, it\u2019s like we\u2019re getting the negative externalities without getting the benefits, I that\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand. We\u2019re already so far in this direction. So let\u2019s at least get the upside instead of only the downside; you\u2019re not going to change the narrative by reducing the USDC PSM even by a billion people will say that it\u2019s still wUSDC, has a huge USDC hole on its balance sheet, right, that can be blacklisted, you\u2019re not going to change the narrative that quickly.  29:59  Nadia Alvarez: Yes, I wanted to add that I understand where these come from, and I understand why Sebas is asking for this because in the past as the BD team and now in growth. We have seen this as a problem because actually, we had an opportunity in the past where this organization needed a decentralized stablecoin, you always heard that people don\u2019t care about decentralization, but Well, in that case, that was an important feature. But because we go then we could then offer to them, they want to one from Dai to USD the that was a problem because they were at some point like losing money in the flow. So I understand why this is important because when you are going outside the crypto world, that one-to-one is important. When we are talking about millions in one transaction, losing ten or 20 basis points is a lot of money. So you Yes, like actually for that opportunity in the past, we couldn\u2019t do it, and we lost that opportunity that went through USDC, although they were looking for a decentralized stablecoin. So yeah, it is the Venezuelan aid project. Exactly, right, That\u2019s the one I\u2019m talking about. So I understood the risk said asked me about my thoughts about having the PSM 00 piece, and I told him like I was like, I didn\u2019t know what the thing because I understand the risk. And I understand that we are charging fees because we are taking the centralization risk when accepting these centralized stablecoins. But on the other side, I understand that if we want to do business with real companies, they are expecting the one-to-one from Dai to USD. And the only way to make an offer to them is to have the PSM with zero fees because, in that way, we are using the PSM as an on-ramp solution using the Paxos rails and the USDC rails. So I think it\u2019s important for us to think if we want to do the real-world assets thing, and we want to engage with more real companies, not just the crypto ones, having the PSM on zero is important.  32:45  Prose11: It\u2019s for preventing that perspective. How do I know monet-supply are next if you have something to say?  32:53  monet-supply: Yeah, I wanted to just make a couple of comments. We\u2019ve been sort of making a push to try and externalize some of our stablecoin holdings. Such as putting it into the GUNI-DAI-USDC vault. And other kinds of similar ideas where we have users owning the USDC as part of a big liquidity pool with many different people. And at least the thesis is that we\u2019re less vulnerable to targeted actions or, like basically being singled out for freezes or blacklisting. And if we do set the DSM fees down to zero. I expect that would eliminate that option where we can externalize some of the holdings in an LPs because if we\u2019re charging 0%, any trades would just go through the PSM rather than LPs. So it would kind of like eliminate that demand for that. Just something to consider. I\u2019m. I like being able to externalize some of that blacklisting risk. We might end up sort of closing that door on ourselves. And then yeah, I mean, the only other thing I\u2019d comment is that I think it would have a pretty big impact on Uniswap and then also Curve and like where people hold their Dai for LP purposes. So yeah, just another kind of general consideration.  34:49  MakerMan: I want to echo what money-supply said you\u2019re going to complete. We can externalize this risk by using people\u2019s our USDC is already creating Dai you know, if you think about this, you can match it with Dai and throw it into the LP pools, so we crush this these markets, these LP pools are dead for us to externalize this risk, it\u2019s a bad idea in principle. Another question, when somebody wants to convert 100 million of whatever into 100 100 million equivalent to something else, I don\u2019t know any bank that will not charge a fee for that. And so, you know, okay, USDC, you know, if I come to circle with 100 million USD, they\u2019re gonna give me 100 or 100, USDC, they\u2019re gonna give me 100 million USD. But there are only the supporters, the only ones that are going to do that; nobody else will give you 100 million USD for 100 million USD, see no one. And so you look at these stable coins on the markets, they do not trade at one; I don\u2019t care how good the stablecoin is; there isn\u2019t one that trades at one on every market everywhere. And so that\u2019s an idea, you know, I understand growth here. You know, when markets kind of want this and, and there are lots of things we want, but sometimes they\u2019re not good. And so I want to reiterate, we don\u2019t want to close this gap; I want to come back to what Monet says we would like to lay this wrist off in a different way, by earning some moderate return by providing LP to be able to convert between these coins for some small fee. It\u2019s not unreasonable. And so that\u2019s all I got.  36:39  Prose11: Thank you. I don\u2019t know, Nick, if you sell something to add; if not, it might be good. Two years from Seb, I know a lot of the reward assets. Originators have talked about the importance of Dai being exactly on the peg. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d want to speak to that a little bit. And I was noticing some questions in chat as to how much it affects things.  37:05  Niklas Kunkel: I don\u2019t want to repeat what I said in chat; I\u2019ve talked enough; I think everyone\u2019s sick of hearing from me.  SamM: He made a good point, though; Nick, about if USDC does get banned by regulators in the PSM, it\u2019s likely going to be banned by regulators and in the LP pools as well. Right. And in that case, the people aren\u2019t going to like save Maker at all; they\u2019re all just going to become USDC or whatever else. And so the risk is still sitting there, and in those funds, we could move the LPS off our boats, but those funds would be trapped anyway.    37:50  Brian McMichael: Well, can I, from a technical perspective, can still be liquidated in an auction, whereas a frozen token cannot, so those would stay on our books forever. Whereas like a USDC or cUSDC, or just a general wet wUSDC, if we were to use that, we could still liquidate off and, you know, presumably, they would have some market value that an option would be that a keeper would pay for.  38:19  Niklas Kunkel: Technically, you could still pay an auction for lock USDC. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s going to always forever sit in the gender and adapter. So you get to have that gem balance.  38:35  SamM: I don\u2019t think we should be driven too much by these sort of remote theoretical possibilities. And we should be more focused on like UX sort of stuff, like what Nadia is saying, sort of, we\u2019re losing out on potential growth by having these sort of, almost to a good solution, but not quite perfect to what people need\u2014and focusing too much on this blacklist risk which he personally I find is a fairly remote possibility. So I think we should be careful about this and what we want to optimize for.  39:15  Prose11: I appreciate all the perspective that has been shared and the many different voices. We have another topic. If there are any thoughts or last things people have not got to say or ask, we will give you a chance to do so. I encourage people to go to the forums and continue this conversation. Lots of the thoughts we are sharing today would benefit from being preserved. We have a different signal that highlighted a couple of different aspects that we thought would be valuable to talk about. Rune\u2019s signal was to increase the emergency shutdown module MKR threshold, and the governance pause delayed the GSM duration. Rune said that he was unable to make it today, unfortunately. I do not know if anyone is comfortable kicking us off.   Governance Security and Flexibility: ESM + Delay parameters  Rune, Protocol Engineering, and Risk 40:57  David Utrobin: I will explain what ESM threshold and governance pause delay are. The ESM threshold is the amount of MKR that is needed to trigger an emergency shutdown at Maker. This is an extremely disruptive process; Dai becomes redeemable for a pro-rata portion of the underlying collateral. It is like a game-theoretical functionality that is there to stop worse things from happening. Like an escape patch, it gracefully winds down the system. Whereas the governance pause delay has to do with the amount of time between the passing of the vote and the execution of the contents of that vote. At the moment, it is a 48-hour delay, and there are office hours built into those.  42:06  Niklas Kunkel: I will elaborate on the ESM. The ESM is a game theory mechanism. It exists as a minority threat protection. The first instance in which we would use it is if a majority of MKR holders are going to vote for something that is super unpopular and does not have consensus from the minority, they have to consider that a minority might shut the protocol down. An extension of that is distinguishing between a popular MKR action but unpopular with the minority versus a governance attack? The second scenario is a proper governance attack; it is malicious and effectively going to steal all the collateral from everybody in the system. If MKR holders can overcome the hack and drop that malicious action, the ESM exists as a cage in the system in case of emergency before the malicious action comes through. The two play together. The GSM delay gives us more time to not take that catastrophic \u201cnuke the system\u201d button and allows us to intervene in the case of a governance attack and find consensus. It makes sense that if you are going to increase the threshold of the ESM that you would also want to increase the governance delay, the pause between when things can execute because you are probably going to need that time to find more consensus, to get MKR holders to burn their MKR to shut the system down.   Questions: 44:10  David Utrobin: I have one question about the signal request. A doubling of the threshold from 75k to 150k seems to be a lot. Presently, how much MKR do we have in the governance contract? It is less than 200k but actively participating is 40k to 50k a week. Does 150k brick us?  44:48  Niklas Kunkel: Let\u2019s take it in two parts. These are complicated features. If we took the DSM, having it exist for all the game theories mentioned earlier seems to make sense. If we were to make the change, and let\u2019s say we made it a million MKR, there is not a million MKR in existence. It would be worthless. But there is a lot of MKR that is either encumbered or lost or would not burn in the case of emergency shutdown. There is some threshold that is unknowable to us where the game theory of that minority thread disappears. If we set it too high above that threshold, we lose the game theory preventions that I was talking about. The question is, has that game theory prevented active attacks that have been in the past? Has there been somebody capable of running a governance attack or pushing some minority will through, but they have not done it because the ESM threatened them? Those are unknowable. Does anybody want to make a really strong argument for not changing it or changing it?  46:23  LongForWisdom: I can talk about changing it up. I agree with you on the minority threat. That is generally a good thing to have. We should not throw it away completely because it encourages every participant to consider others\u2019 opinions. It pushes people towards consensus versus majority rules, which is a great thing for the stability of the protocol in the long term. As for where that is, I do not know. It is hard to tell. 150k does seem quite high to me. Based on what we have seen voting previously, it is rare that we ever have 150k on the hat. We might have seen it a few times but not recently. At that point, it is equivalent to what we would normally take to pass an exact. To be useful, we would have to see hundreds of 1000s more Maker appear and become governance active and then want something. I think it is unlikely. The flip side is that you do not want it to be too low. Otherwise, there is the risk of people calling it maliciously. But I think that risk is overestimated given the cost of performing that attack.  47:53  Niklas Kunkel: On to the point of that attack, I do not think there are any economic incentives for MKR holders to trigger a shutdown like that. This is a spiteful move; unless they are competitors, there would be a strategic advantage to triggering a shutdown. In the worst-case scenario, you are a nation-state actor competitor, and a nation-state actor may be able to coerce like large enough MKR holders to trigger a shutdown, and they would find that beneficial. There are still two threats here.  Nik Kunkel: I think saying that there\u2019s no financial incentive to trigger it is a little bit naive. Because of the power of financialization. You can imagine a large player who does not have much stake in crypto at all. They build a large short position on Maker and other cryptos. If Maker goes into emergency shutdown, I guarantee you not only does the price of MKR go down, but probably other pieces of DeFi, and Eth. We are small enough now that it would not be like a major event for Eth. Imagine somebody with a huge MKR short if you can put that on in enough size compared to the cost of purchasing MKR and putting it into the ESM, you can have a profitable financial incentive. LongForWisdom: I agree. It is possible. But you need a lot of MKR available to short for that to be viable.    49:35  Niklas Kunkel: If you can short other things than MKR, we assume the only way they are profiting is through an MKR short. There might be other ways to profit; it will do things to Dai as you can imagine. The price of Dai is probably going to trade somewhat below par even if ESM is triggered because there is a cost to doing all the redemptions. It is going to be bought at a discount after emergency shutdowns. Imagine that you go ahead, and you can probably say short Dai to some extent. You could probably profit in more ways than just crashing the price of MKR with the ESM attack.  50:33  Juan: If you are a competitor, is it just marketing budgets? You destroy a growing project, like Maker, and even if you do not profit from the trade, that could be a way of going about it. It is far-fetched, but it is a risk.  50:52  LongForWisdom: It is whether if you can guarantee a profit from it. I do not imagine malicious actors would go to that much trouble unless they were sure they could profit from it. It is possible, but it would be difficult to be sure that you could, to the amounts to make it worth it.  51:26  monet-supply: About the threshold, it would not only be the current value of MKR that it would cost you to make this attack. If you bought 7.5% of the supply, it would have you to trigger it now; it would drive the price up a substantial amount. You can borrow some of it from Aave or Compound, for example. But you would need some Excess capital to collateralize your position. However much the value of 7.5% of supply is now, you would need a substantial amount more capital than that to make this attack happen. 50% more at least. With the ability to short stuff like DeFi tokens on centralized exchanges, it would not be that hard to get enough short exposure to make it profitable.  52:47  Niklas Kunkel: You could short with leverage on centralized exchanges. The borrowing is a great point, and MKR will be very cheap after shut down.  53:06  MakerMan: About leverage exposure. We had already written on this a year ago. That I considered this an attack vector as DeFi grows. DYDX allows significant leverage. Pick your centralized exchange and a couple in any analysis about how strongly correlated the markets are; you can get a huge short depth than Eth. You can crash Maker by locking all the assets and forcing all Dai to be hitting up for those assets, most of which are USDC, you have got a real nice leverage short position both on Eth, and you can do Maker. You are going to have to pony up to buy some Maker to try to pull this off. You are going to need some. These markets are not deep enough to buy it straight up. You will have to borrow it to buy and accumulate and then set up your short positions. The thing that is not going to crash that you will make money on is not just Maker. You are going to shock the whole DeFi system doing this. You can short Dai potentially, although. You would do this only if we pull the USDC from the PSM. You leave that as like 100 million exposure that will get ripped out instantly during this whole scenario. And so basically, if that is set up to go, you short Dai leverage, you short Eth leverage, and you short Maker leverage to boot. Then you drop it in the ESM and watch what happens. You can make enough money off that. Was that profitable based on accumulating enough Maker you need to pull it off now? I do not know. If you find one or two well-heeled Maker players that are willing to run with you on that, it is a game over. I posted a long time ago that Maker going into the system to do stuff should have to sit in a wallet for a while so that you cannot flash the stuff out. You cannot do it instantly. You have to do it with Maker that was sitting there ready to go. That is a different game. And the question is, how long? And what are the implications of making it so that people have to wait to get into either the ESM or governance so that Maker has to sit and simmer? To the season is what I call that before it can do stuff of this importance in the system?  55:36  Prose11: Commenting on the chat. It is a question of where is the right threshold for where we are at now? And for the at least short runway of the foreseeable future? Higher seems to be agreed, but maybe not 150k.  56:19  Kirk: It is time to net reduce the risk. As Maker grows, the incentive to attack grows. As DeFi continues to financially mature and crypto markets financially mature, it becomes easier to attack. If in the future it shuts down, 150k feels too high to me. We have struggled to get anything close to that amount of participation and governance polls. We are still in a regime where you might need honest actors to respond and trigger the ESM, possibly on short notice. If there is some sort of critical bug, I feel safer to have it than not have it, but 150k sounds like it is high enough to disable it effectively. Imagine how many different VC funds and stuff you have to mobilize to move their MKR on short notice. It defeats the instant nature of it. It probably cannot be triggered quickly enough to be practically effective.  57:43  Prose11: We do have the other side of this, which is the GSM delay. We have a similar linkage. You would use the delay to rally a vote. You do not have to depend on the emergency shutdown. However, there are plenty of cases imaginable where you would not be able to do that. Having one that is too long to be effective when a bug is discovered is not good. Having a governance delay that is too short and that does not give you enough time to consider an alternative other than the ESM would not be great.  58:38  Niklas Kunkel: At two days, the governance delay is far too long to matter. In the event of most bugs or hacks. Response times for DeFi incidents are minutes to hours at best. The Compound thing was mostly over within the first two hours. It took people a little bit longer to figure out the reservoir thing, but it was still within 24 hours. That was a slow attack by most DeFi standards. Usually, they are over in a block. We are already in a position where the GSM delay is far too long to effectively respond to any urgent issue. We have strategies for dealing with those called Instant Access modules. We can freeze the oracles instantly with a governance vote. We have that bypass because we know that the danger is that it is not a riskless thing, but it is less risky than full access to the system. An Oracle attack is dangerous enough that we need the ability to respond instantly. We already have a solution for these things that need some responses, and it is called Instant Access modules, which can have various logic for how you trigger them. It can be MKR weighted voting; it can be based on just on-chain conditions. For minor things, you could even have multisig to handle it. On the other hand, I am arguing that there is not a lot of downside to making the governance delay go from two days to four days. If it were from two days to two months, that would be a meaningful change. But with four days, you could still do a weekly cycle in executive voting, and it should not mess up too much operationally. Although if anybody has something I have overlooked there, let me know. On the other hand, two days versus four days is a big gain in responding to some sort of malicious governance attack. Imagine that malicious actors managed to overtake the hat because MKR was slow to move and got spread out on proposals or something and some malicious spells queued up. There is going to be some response time for that. You are going to have to mobilize MKR holders to retake the hat. Then you are going to have to do technical things that allow you to drop the malicious spell. Two more days is a meaningful amount of time to respond to a threat like that. Also, it is meaningful to respond to a governance attack in that amount of time. It is a good idea at this point to lengthen it out a little bit. Because it has tangible benefits, and the downsides do not seem that bad.  1:01:51  Wouter: I am not convinced that there is no big difference between two and four days. The DeFi bugs, maybe. Even that, it is pretty shaky that assumption. The much bigger risk is that we are being lulled to sleep because we are in a stable situation where we seem to have forgotten about the market turmoil, and everything that requires changes to the protocol on a timescale of days and a week would make a big difference. If we discussed USDC risk, a regulatory action, and so on two days versus four days, it could make a very big difference. I do not see the need to make it any longer, the two days it is working. We are not doing the full spectrum analysis. We are just changing it because we have not needed it in a while, and we were not thinking the risks through. I strongly oppose changing it to four days because four days is a long reaction time to anything that might happen.  1:03:28  LongForWisdom: Three days over two days might have some worth forty-eight hours can be timed to be the whole of the weekend. If you have a 72-hour delay, you at least guarantee one working day, like absent holidays. That is not too much given that somebody time things for holidays. Four days does seem a bit arbitrary, in terms of why four or not two or three or five or whatever?  1:04:00  Prose11: Several times, our executives have had office hours modifications. A four-day GSM pause office hours means you could have a full week before you can enact something, depending on what it touches.  1:04:22  Wouter: This is where our risk management fails. It should be easy to pull up the list of risks that we need to consider in changing this parameter, and we do not have that. We go by a recent memory of things, and in this case, it is bad. Maybe chances are relatively low that something would go catastrophically wrong if we move it from two to four days. But we have not made that analysis properly.  1:05:00  Niklas Kunkel: I am not sure I agree with this thing, that there is a large probability weight of things that we could respond to with a two-day delay and not a four-day delay. Black Thursday was over in 12 hours; a 24-hour delay was far too much back then. Do you have some scenario or example where if a protocol had a two-day delay instead of a four-day delay, it would have helped them? I agree that such things could exist, but I have been in DeFi for 2.5 years, and I have not seen an example.  1:05:43  Wouter: The last one is a bad argument. I am longer at DeFi than you are.  1:05:48  Niklas Kunkel: Have you seen one? Can you give me an example?  1:05:53  Wouter: That is my point. We have forgotten about a lot what happened. Around the time that Dai was moving away from the peg, creating a lot of concern. There were a lot of things that were considered where the days mattered. Black Thursday, sure. But even Black Thursday can cover or react within one crash versus two crashes that might happen within a week. We have changed the auction mechanism; for example, you do not want to wait for four days to put these things in place.  1:06:48  Niklas Kunkel: If you do not want to wait for four days, you do not want to wait for two days either. We may be splitting in hairs; there may be no meaningful difference between them.  1:07:11  SamM: My example is that we had the Global DC in May. During that big crash, there was no minting for two or three days. That is something where we wanted to go through ASAP and could have significant effects on the peg.  1:07:33  Christopher Mooney: You people hit all my points periodically while going through that. First of all, I strongly agree with Wouter to have some old risk analysis around this, but we should have some risk weights; we can argue over specific probability weights. That would maybe help inform us as to whether or not we want to make this choice. In addition to that, there may be some benefit in taking other parameters in the system that would need to be changed and in thinking about exactly what would be suitable for either an Instant Access Module or a Mom with a multisig, etc. Because we may benefit, we may be able to have our cake and eat it too. I will remind everyone that leading up to Black Thursday, we had just gone through like this big PR thing where megazolt2 published all this stuff about theoretical governance attacks on the chief. In response to that, we finally added this; it was a 72-hour delay at the time to try and mitigate governance attacks. What we have done is that we leaned too hard on that end of the risk spectrum. It went active a few days before black Thursday, and then Black Thursday happened. Rather than us being able to intervene in either circuit breaker auctions or change auction parameters in a way that would have accounted for the level of network congestion, our hands were tied. There is nothing that we could have done, and that risk should not be understated.  1:09:37  Monet-supply: The GSM delays play into a couple of areas of risk management or what we review for asset parameters. As an example, we look at the maximum amount of extra USDC that we could end up putting on within two days before we can make governance changes. If we lengthen the governance delay, some of those parameters might need to be looked at again. Are we still comfortable adding up to a billion dollars of stablecoins a day if it would take us four days to make any changes? Or would we want to reduce that?  1:10:30  Prose11: A lot of our risk assumptions hinge on this delay factor. LongForWisdom posted the link to the signal in the chat. I encourage people to visit it. Right now, we have the vast majority of people voting yes to the increase on both of these, which does not super reflect the nature of this call. But it might be worth revisiting there. Are there other aspects of this topic that we wanted to cover?  1:11:13  Niklas Kunkel: Is it possible to give a more granular definition. Rune made the signal request. Maybe we could break it into a couple of different options on each front. And let people do that, or we could do a rank choice pull on-chain. That may have our land more granularly on a set of Goldilocks changes that will work for these parameters.  1:11:46  LongForWisdom: Someone else can make another better signal request. Regardless of whether this one passes or fails, we can follow it up with the result of the other one. Worst case, we end up doing this to get voted through on-chain. And then we change it to something else.  1:12:03  Niklas Kunkel: A key question is whether these parameters need to be connected this closely. There is a strong argument for raising the ESM threshold. The question becomes, does that necessitate lengthening the governance delay? It raises your response time if you need to trigger the ESM in response to the majority government\u2019s tech. Is that strictly necessary? Have you tuned those hard to say? If you increase the ESM threshold, you increase one of your risks, the malicious majority attack. That one is a low probability.  1:12:59  LongForWisdom: It is not the attack thing that it is supposed to stop. It does not have to be a malicious majority that it is supposed to defend against. It can be a majority that wants something that a majority thinks is unreasonable.  1:13:19  Niklas Kunkel: In the past, I have globally called the ESM a minority grief mechanism. It is one of the most debated things, and it is all about how probability would weigh different bad scenarios. It is one of the hardest things to reason about because it is all based on what your priors are for what is most likely to go wrong. The more the system matures and bakes in, the argument of you needing it for critical bugs decreases. But governance attacks and what is a governance attack is very philosophical. I have flipped-flopped a few times on how necessary it is, how useful it is. I almost default to; things are going well right now. Unless there is a very strong argument to mitigate risk in one particular direction, maybe leave well enough alone.  1:14:34  Prose11: Thanks to everybody for sharing your thoughts. These are complex topics. I appreciate hearing from so many voices and getting so much perspective on why we are considering the things we are. Burban, you would ask for a couple of minutes. This might be your time to shine.  1:14:54  Andrew Burban: This is about debt ceilings and where we are in the market cycle and ties into the g7 delay stuff. We are entering the final stage of the market cycle, which will be a bumpy ride, but things will grow exponentially. Our debt ceilings could start getting hit quickly as prices move up. I would like to see all of them raised, and maybe with the Instant Access Module on them, the time lock, reduced potentially. I do not want another GSM delay. If things do three, five, ten, X, quickly. We want to have Dai available for me to boost or for whoever to boost. I do not know how much people love wBTC; there is contention about it. I am long on Bitcoin through the DeFi server using WBTC. Whether or not I believe in Bitcoin long-term, it does not matter. It is going to do it till the end of the cycle. I would like to see a WBTC B vault that is less urgent; I do not want debt ceilings to be getting hit on the way up. For me to boost or for anyone else to be able to boost. If we cap out at some point, mid-run, I do not want something like the GSM delay to hold this up for three, four days, or something like that. Before things start getting out of hand, there could be some discussion over increasing the debt ceilings available to ETH-B, especially how quickly the timer unlocks raising the ESM.  1:17:32  Prose11: Thanks for sharing, Burban. Definitely, in the spirit of the posts, LongForWisdom put up earlier this week, where it is if you have something you believe is right and that the community should be considering, please do throw up a signal request. That is what the whole process is about. In terms of the assets with the debt ceiling Instant Access Module, there are many different ways you can play with that. We should discuss this in detail later. I wanted to throw out from the government side; you can mess with the max line, mess with the TTL the time to increase again, mess with the gap parameter, how big we are targeting, and the gap between the DC and the available debt. There are many different ways you could encourage broader access to these funds as DC starts to tighten. These are fun governance parameters to consider for a signal request. We are happy to help out, to show templates or resources if anyone is uncomfortable for any reason on making this signal request. We encourage people to make their requests when they are bringing the proposal forward.  1:18:52  Andrew Burban: Payton points me in the right direction to make the forum posts for this little request. Suppose anyone else wants to chime in with thoughts on this.  1:19:06  Niklas Kunkel: When you make the signal requests, I will remind everybody who will consider it or if you will make it. The risk of the Instant Access Module is that whether a price crashes in an asset. That price crashes beyond the collateralization threshold within that time, which allows for the minting of unbacked Dai, and that unbacked Dai hits the surplus buffer. Whatever parameters you end up choosing, be mindful that is the counterbalance. It is all Goldilocks. We should name this meeting the Goldilocks meeting. That is the thing we are trying to balance on the other side. It is not allowing too much unbacked Dai to be maintained in the case of extreme market shock.  1:19:55  Andrew Burban: I agree. I do not know what parameters I will be seeking specifically. It will be more like a general idea of loosening things up.  1:20:06  Niklas Kunkel: Probably some combination between that TTL and the gap. It might be worth thinking through those\u2014the other side of the scenario with the TTL and the gap. What you want, what we want, going into like a rocketing market, and what will work. Also, think about what happens on the downside if the parameters are set that way.  1:20:28  Andrew Burban: An encouragement for people to use DeFi saver or some sort of liquidation protection, which mitigates our risk with automatic repays before they get liquidated, emergency replace. But not everyone uses automation to protect their Vaults, and it exposes them to more risk. That integration cannot be pushed through that quickly\u2014good things to consider.  1:21:09  Payton Rose: There has been a lot of great discussions today. I encourage everyone to bring it back to the forums. As we said, there is a couple of signals we discussed heavily today, where you might need to change your vote or voice some of the opinions or reflections you have had after the conversation today. That is what the forums are there for, for that engagement and to document it. Please do. I appreciate everyone today for sharing so many different perspectives. Happy Thursday. Another meeting in the books. I will be shutting off the recording now. As always, see you in the forums and the chat. Thanks to everyone.

My name is Payton Rose. I am one of the Governance Facilitators at MakerDAO. We like people to get involved and ask questions or comments, so please, do not be shy if you have something to say.   Weekly Updates  Governance  Payton Rose 01:53 Weekly Executive Vote  Current executive We have one executive ongoing involving three things; a rate change distribution of our August core unit budgets, housekeeping matters, and parameter changes. Take a look at that and consider voting. Three ratification polls are currently live:  Declaration of Intent - Onboarding a new collateral type backed by B.Protocol v2 DAI Foundation Core Unit Growth Core Unit MKR Budget   One community greenlight poll is live: https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qmch87Tw?network=mainnet#poll-detail ends on August 16th. Real-world assets type facility, you got three more days to signal the community if we should be putting in our time to onboard that as collateral. We will be skipping the executive vote this Friday and will batch it with next week\u2019s executive.   GovAlpha Core Unit update  Payton Rose 03:40 GovAlpha Weekly Update  The 3rd Meet Your Delegate Call recording is now up on YouTube. Currently have six public delegates. Goals: map out the participation and communication tracking of metric tracking for participating recognized delegates. Following Monday, we will do the first round and make sure everything works. We are going to continue to push for integrations of the delegate contracts with custody providers. Our larger holders can vote and delegate securely. Next budget proposal is now up on the forum, covering six months from Q4 2021 and Q1 2022. We will try and move towards longer budgets to get a better idea of how much the CU costs to run and figure out our goals. We are hoping for the next one to be 12 months; this one is for 6 months. Working on launching documentation for Governance to launch through the Maker Operational Manual via Gitbook. Gala is helping us, organizing and managing that project; looking forward to getting it launched and removing critical information. Pablo is now a full MIP editor!   Forum at a Glance  Artem Gordon 07:05 Forum at a Glance for August 6th - 12th  Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 14:20 Available for next week\u2019s spell:  The MATIC OSM and Medianizer are now ready. MATIC is ready for onboarding. DssVest has Completed FV specs. It is a v1, which helps to pay teams. We hope to get that out before we have to do the next round of Core Unit payments to establish the vesting next time around. That is only for payments to teams, not MKR investing. We are looking at creating a PSM for PAX. For the 6S RWA, there is a broker-dealer address. The output conduit will end up sending DAI funds to that address with Gemini. I have validated that address is a Gemini-controlled address. that change will also go in there now that there is no increase in the debt ceiling. We had one of our deployer addresses test that facility, and we will yank our deployer address from there.  Other Priorities:  GUNI has ongoing team reviews and audits. We recently found something in the Oracle for that; We are still iterating on that. D3M is getting a review from the AAVE Team. There are ongoing discussions to determine debt ceilings and whatnot with stETH. We will also try and put together a list of milestones that we want to hit, maybe just Maker milestones between Risk and PE, to set hard limits on where we think the debt ceiling should be and add pressure for them to move their roadmap to a more decentralized and safe place. StETH has ongoing discussions to determine debt ceilings.  Maintenance work:  Changelog updates since previous RWA spells have passed. Adding a CalcFactory to improve collateral onboarding. Formal Verification proofs/rules for CropJoin. Enhancing RWA DC tests in our spells, something that came out of a postmortem we had. The flip to EIP 1559 has messed up the tooling space a little bit; a lot of us spun our wheels on tooling over the last week or so. It looks like DAPtools is up to date, which is one of our big pieces of tooling.  L2 updates:  Kris is doing e2e tests for Arbitrum.  Kris: Refactor all typescript helpers and reuse them between Arbitrum and Optimism bridges (in progress).     Questions  ElProgreso: Regarding the Starknet engineering CU, I wondered if PE has been thinking about how to incentivize folks to go over once it\u2019s up and running right. If you look at dYdX, they have done it brilliantly. They released it via StarkEx regarding the scalability, the engine, and there are incentives. Has your team had the chance to skill mill with Starkware regarding incentivizing folks to go over once it is up and running, six months from now or a year?  Derek: We have not spoken about how folks would move over from our team to the Starknet team after it gets up and running. They propose to focus on an initial six-month road map initially. Have some key deliverables that get their solution to deliver. Then, explore how it impacts liquidation or how other modules can move over into the ZK roll-up space. We have not focused on that or discussed it much, just trying to see how this space will evolve. One of the comments I had with Planet_X earlier this week is that we are not picking a winner; we do not know where the liquidity will go for DAI, whether it is Optimism uptrend or ZK or Staknet etc. We\u2019re making sure we have our bases covered, and we have these opportunities here, how that will evolve. We will discuss it as their solutions become more solidified regarding the opportunity they present to the existing protocol and where we see liquidity and DAI moving in these spaces.   ElProgreso: Is there a metric that we are keeping as far as if Optimism has been having success? I have heard rumors that they are having a hard time getting some TVL, right. I wonder if you have ideas. How do you keep up with how much money is moving over there to these L2s?  Derek: I do not have a specific metric yet. We reference one Kris has built a way to view the total value of assets locked. I think it is just something we need to keep an open mind to see where liquidity is flowing. We should start to incorporate in our risk framework because it is not just about risk but also about the reward and revenue that these different opportunities present, and at some point, we will have an evolution where we need to consider off-boarding certain protocols if they are not performing or are not delivering value. We are not there yet in due course, but it will be considered just like we have done with other collateral types.     Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 24:32  Today, we published proposed liquidation ratio changes that are in line with risk evaluation from last week; please have a look at proposed changes; we plan to include them in an on-chain poll next week. We decided this after we did not see any objections to our proposal. Mark posted analysis that shows how Makerbots are making vault users use their DAI. We identified about 30% of Italian words with various farming activities. I suggest you read this post. The recalculated net yield from paying stability field Maker and opportunity costs on its deposits, so the calculated yield is around 9%. The plan is to connect Maker vaults with other farming activities and track this in real-time. This helps us because we can identify whether these users are net long or short DAI. This gives us a better picture of how they can react when it comes to liquidations. The other analysis that is currently in progress is to identify how these users are protecting their worlds if they use automated strategies and to keep it short. The end goal of what we are currently doing is to know what user behavior practices but also track their own chain balances; this gives us a complete understanding of how risky every exposure is at Maker; by knowing this, we can offer better conditions through lower liquidation ratios, higher depth ceiling, slow rates and so on. Monet-supply made two posts this week, one regarding dust levels. Dust levels are quite high at Maker. Usually, the evaluated appropriate dust levels were in liquidations; basically, look at the minimum depth amount or depth size where liquidation is still profitable and does not lead to losses. This time, monet-supply choose a different approach; he compared gas costs of managing a vault for different depth sizes, estimating gas costs from a user perspective. The result was that 5,000 to 10,000 is actually a pretty reasonable dust level because if you use certain stressed scenarios, gas costs can already be attributed to more than 5% on yearly cost levels, which is two times as much as the ETA rate currently. The other post was regarding collateral off-boarding framework; this planner framework is still in discussion. The steps of parameter changes that need to be applied to abort these collaterals align with what we discussed with other facilitators. The only potential unknown criteria are the time frame, so whether we should be more aggressive with some collaterals such as, for instance, KNC, where there is no real economic benefit of having this collateral enabled. We need to determine how aggressive we want to be with these parameter changes that follow. There is ongoing work on Institutional Vaults. We are proceeding with evaluating Nexo\u2019s current exposure and their historical track record, protecting their world with the PE team, and still discussing appropriate dev conspires. We are evaluating B.Protocol proposer for onboarding new collateral type, fixed-rate vaults proposal by the Deco protocol, we submitted a proposal for the Maker compensation for the team.   Oracles Team Update  Marco-Andre 30:35  The MATIC oracle is now ready to go. We are coordinating the PSM and cleaning up some permissions once we confirm that everything is alright. Fees and relayers are updated; they are pushing prices. Development side: we began the work for EIP 1559 for relayers, both on the new codebase and the current Omnia software in production. Tools is catching up with London and the EIP 1559, which allows us to do the work on our end. Both are progressing relatively well. We merged some code that will give us additional flexibility on gas price strategies for relayers. Regarding EIP 1559, we are assessing a good pricing strategy for transactions. It\u2019s unclear if we will develop something that will result in gas savings and safe costs for MakerDAO. We will do some calculations in this regard. Software development team side: we finished the deployment of both major pieces of software in Gopher and Spire, we started doing much-needed refactoring work. The goal is to give additional deployment and configuration options to feeds and relayers.   Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 33:47 Real-World Finance Core Unit Report NewSilver July Update RWA July Report  We are setting up, we have memos and articles of association. You can discuss how much control you want to give to authorized signers to some committees, basically how much control you want MakerDAO to keep or give to third parties. We are looking for servicers; two are operators of the Cayman Foundation. We are pursuing the SolarX transaction, hopefully in September. Discussions with people: our asset is good but small, and it is not moving the needle and not helping with the USDC; we have too much USDC in the PSM. Maybe we can use the Cayman Foundation to invest in safe assets so that we can get at least a bit of yield; I shared this in a forum poll. We decided to pause on data infrastructure regarding RWA. There were some complications. We are focusing on using Dune Analytics for deep analysis to push MakerDAO in front of the default community as a world. I hope with this funding, 6 - 8 million that the tool will get better. It is worthy of continuing using it and not invest too much elsewhere. Finance front: Aes is working on Institutional World Economic Analysis. He made a post asking the community regarding financial reporting. Working on a post regarding pushing on-chain securitization to the next step. We will publish it next week. New job position on the RWF team: looking for an expert in securitization.  6S Progress:  Matthew has helped close the first institutional Delaware statutory trust structure with a world-class trial, world-class trustee. With a world-class trustee on board, the DAO can bring on a whole suite of new trustees for success and any party that wants to step forward to deploy capital safely and to do so at an ultra-scale.   Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 41:36 Growth CU Weekly Updates  Working with various entities to help create a solution for Institutional Vaults. It will be a good solution to generate more DAI supply, but not all companies or entities interested in using the service are Nexo; it is an exception that is willing to use MAkerDAO to create different programs to increase their warning or earners in the Indian market. The Institutional and Long-Term Vault proposal is our first step. We will then look into institutions for Dai loans. Hoping to use loans as the middleman between Maker and Institutions. Currently speaking with two potential entities. We plan to put up a weekly poll for the Paxos PSM.  Stars of the week:  Bitbns, an Indian exchange, will include the DAI/INR pair and start a series of campaigns to increase Dai awareness in the Indian market. Skylo App, a wallet for P2P transactions with DAI from BSC, runs campaigns in Latin America, mainly in Argentina and Venezuela. Micah Johnson is an artist that is receiving DAI donations to support two kids.   Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Update  Juan Guill\u00e9n 47:24 SES Public Drive  Created a forecasting template for Dogfooding products available in our public drive. Created an MKR Compensation template, which is found in our public drive. Looking for talent!

So I know that you mentioned now that you don\u2019t have anybody helping with the enormous work workload. So my question is, are you looking for help? Are you calling out to the community for some help?  I will be looking for help. Once the role Is more defined, we\u2019re going to have a call part of the global team, to kind to refine what the media role Is and de want from it; once de have that down, yes, I will probably be looking for help.     Presentations and Other Discussions  Open Discussion  (Variable rates vault - Flash Loans) 1:03:35  We open it up to general discussion; earlier in the call, we have a comment from Bourbon about variable rates vault; I know there\u2019s some discussion saying that right now would not be technically possible. However, I think that\u2019s an interesting discussion to have.  Sam was saying it might not be technically that easy to implement right now; I think it could be a good idea down the line, if it\u2019s possible to do, one of the reasons we charge more is because these people using it are riskier but if their vaults are sitting at a regular ratio then, why should they be paying the six percent? They\u2019d be paying a lower percentage, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve run three different oracle oracles for this be for more, so I this you know if there are three separate oracles for something, maybe this would reduce some overhead, wouldn\u2019t it just be like a sliding scale thing I don\u2019t think you\u2019d need oracles well, I don\u2019t know exactly how it would technically work, but you know it could be easier to maintain one thing for us rather than three different vault types, so I think you guys get the idea I think it\u2019s probably not a priority, but maybe other users might see the same necessity for this and perhaps there is a lot of demand for something like this.   The challenge is really around finding an efficient way to implement it. I mean, the sort of poor man\u2019s way to do it is like we have three ETH types already. So you could build some automation. That would move you between the three of them based on where you were keeping your collateralization ratio. The problem is that it\u2019s probably not economical from a gas perspective.  Yes, If the intensive gas that would come out of the vault.   Somebody could build like an aggregator kind of thing, top of Maker where if people were all willing to say accept the same amount of exposure, you could have multiple depositors putting into it. Then you could socialize, the gas costs in some way by, you know, having some operator that does the rebalancing between different fee rates Eths and then like some there\u2019s some diversion of the profits may, you know, to that operator to compensate them for that. And so that would be like, something would be like a style thing built on top of Maker. Is it possible to do it within a vaults Type? But like obviously like a new vault type where it\u2019s just mapped like that whole curve is just mapped.  Well, They\u2019re like efficiency problems. How do you continuously update the stability fee? You probably need some keeper for that. Like you could design a vault-like this, but, basically, you need something constantly poking and, taking into account each price and how much DAI people draw from their vaults. And you also need now like per vault storage because different vaults will also individually have different rates within that doesn\u2019t jive well with the way. The contracts are structured and factored in. it interesting problem, but it\u2019s the short answer that you can\u2019t do it easily. You can implement it but only allow users to use it using something like the Defi saver or Oasis. Yes, it\u2019s like liquidation is the risk only allowing for users. That employs a service that protects them from liquidation.   I have another topic you might want to discuss flash Loans because we deployed the module more than one month ago, and still no one used it. So, I wonder what we missed because I think it\u2019s a great opportunity.  Yeah, I get the impression people are just not aware that the amount of money is not significant enough to move people. We will get more traction if we go to zero percent fee because dYdX is still the first option people usually go to because it\u2019s free.   So. I\u2019m here asking, Is there an easy way to compare the gas usage for like our flash loans implementation versus like dYdX has?  You can test this need to if you go check transactions; they usually kind of doing a whole bunch of extra. So it\u2019s hard to look. You probably have to rig up a test yourself. I mean, the cheap way to sort of estimate if you want to like do it by looking at contracts is like will get how many operations there are because those tend to dominate gas and then beyond that, look at this loads to the second-biggest contribution that they can give you pretty good rough idea than just based on the gas cost of those off codes. The difference will be, But it\u2019s also easy to write a test for it. Gas measurement is a standard depth thing to do.

My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the Governance Facilitator at MakerDAO. If you want to ask questions or have comments, please do speak up. Everyone here enjoys answering questions.   Weekly Updates  Governance  LongForWisdom 01:02  Last week\u2019s executive passed. That will bring the Core Unit distributions for May to the ratified Core Units. It moves a bunch of ERC-20 assets to Liq 2.0 as well.   Polls  We had several polls this week. All of them finished. Regarding MIPs\u2019 polls, we had the Direct Deposit Module (MIP50), SES Core Unit Set, MIP0 Amendments, MIP51 revamping Monthly Governance Cycle, all continued to the next stage. We had a couple of inclusion polls that failed to move forward. These were the Strategic Marcomms Core Unit proposals and the Staking Rewards proposal (MIP49). These will either move back to RFC or be dropped, depending on what the authors decide. Regarding other proposals, the monthly Parameter Changes Proposal from the MakerDAO Open Market Committee passed. So we should see that in this week\u2019s executive, along with Uniswap LPs.   GovAlpha Core Unit Update 02:46  I\u2019ve been working on our budget for the next quarter, which\u2019s now in the forum.  @prose11 posted his facilitator proposal. I\u2019m looking forward to him joining me as a facilitator of GovAlpha. It\u2019ll be great if that passes. He\u2019s been working with SourceCred and a couple of other groups around budgeting stuff and general coordination.  @elihu is working on forum modifications. He also moderates in the post of his calls us to a good faith engagement from all participants.  @blimpa is working on MIPs and the MIPs portal, doing MIPs\u2019 fixes. Making some good changes and cleaning some things up. Finally, @charlesstlouis has been doing usual MIP-Editor responsibilities. They\u2019ve been working on onboarding @blimpa as well. That\u2019s an early stage of him taking the role of MIP-Editor.   Forum at a Glance  Payton Rose 04:20 Forum at a Glance - Forum Thread  Three-Point Summary   Lots of MIPs in the RFC, you can take a look and see everything that\u2019s asking for comments before it moves on. We have five core units receiving their monthly budgets on Monday. We\u2019ll be distributing a little over 390,000 DAI. There\u2019s been plenty of MKR burning going. The lerp module makes it intermittent, having it on for some time and then off. At the same time, we raise it back to the expected line of burning about 25% of our incoming revenue. There are about 83 MKR tokens burned in the last 24h.   Announcements   Liquidations 2.0 portal is live! This allows anyone to participate easily. Due to the Dutch auctions, flash loans are enabled. You no longer need a giant pool of liquidity to participate in bidding on ongoing collateral auctions. SES is looking for people to help identify MakerDAO risks and opportunities. That\u2019s a good post to leave your two cents on.   Discussions   @Paperimperium is asking who does routine due diligence for the DAO. Lots of good discussions there, including what we should be looking into when people ask us for money. There\u2019s a new DROP token for the RWA, FortunaFi. In addition, they have their risk evaluation posted in the forum. We had @g_dip announcing that the Real World Asset Company (RWA Co.) is coming live to serve to bridge the gap between the legacy credit markets and MakerDAO.   Signal Requests  There\u2019s just one signal request still going on from @mrabino1. It concerns increasing the DSR. Interestingly, there are more options to choose from than just yes/no when voting.   Questions and comments  Christopher Mooney: I got one minor correction. The UI is live for Liquidations 2.0 and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s flash loan enabled. I believe you need to show up with the DAI, but that\u2019s still great. Any Web3 user can come and bid on an auction.  LongForWisdom: Awesome, good to have that correction.     Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 08:16  We posted the postmortem of the end bug in the forum, so if you guys haven\u2019t read that yet, you can check it out. Some action items came out of that, and that\u2019s the practice that we are going to continue to follow anytime we get a bug like that. It\u2019s a good idea to iterate. The entire process is blameless. We\u2019re just hoping that all teams involved can end up with a better outcome in the future. We also posted the DssFest. The backstop keeper is updated for all of the standard collateral types. The keeper did manage to function and took an auction yesterday. It worked on decimals of 18. The demo keeper had a problem with nonstandard decimals like the WBTC auction that happened. I am going to try to debug that and figure that out. There were plenty of other keepers in the ecosystem to take those auctions. It was the most significant single liquidation that the Protocol has ever done: nearly 3 Million. Two keepers showed up. One of them was a capitalized keeper who already had half of the funds and did a take. The other one cycled the remainder on SushiSwap. Maybe it\u2019s the other way around: SushiSwap happened first and then the other keeper. That sounds perfect. It\u2019s a bunch of stuff that we spent a lot of time designing and hoping would happen, and it occurred how we wanted to. We did a vote delegate review today. There\u2019s an old contract from a few years ago that I had thrown together, and Sam recently modernized it for today\u2019s standard. We are currently looking at a very light touch on vote delegation. This is just a vote proxy that does delegation and would allow us to do delegation with the chief. We are currently reviewing that. For the weekly executive cycle, we\u2019ve got the oracle LPs which  Nick may talk more about this week. We are pushing Liq 2.0 back one week, and then we can push the actual LP tokens to liquidations 2.0. That bought us enough time to update the clipper and the demo auction keeper so that it can unwind those LP tokens. It also allows us to point at the new oracles when we do that spell. It\u2019s the perfect place to interject the oracle update. It\u2019s Oracles update this week, LPs next week, and we will do all the stable coins the week after that. We are probably going to do the Sushi joint adapter the week after that.   Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 14:07  As Chris mentioned, we\u2019re doing the redeploy of the LP oracle with the newly updated version that\u2019s the post-audit, along with some gas optimizations that Kurt made. We are looking forward to that so it can save a little bit more money. That will be going out tomorrow. It\u2019s going to cost a couple of thousands of dollars in ETH, around ten thousand dollars. On the Core Unit side, I posted two of the three MIP sub proposals yesterday, and the last one will be posted right after this call. Happy to see that some of you have already been looking that over. We are looking forward to hearing your feedback for the remainder. The other thing that we have to start looking at is that the Foundation is shutting down. Committed to that by recently sending over the remainder of the MKR in the developer\u2019s multi-sig. The foundation is on a timer here. It has some money left. That money is to pay people salaries that need to continue until the shutdown and for the token rewards that people are still owned. However, variable costs, such as the Oracle costs, have currently been absorbed exclusively by the Foundation. If the cost for the gas doubles, then the cost for the Foundation to Oracles doubles as well. It is probably time, with the Backend Services team splitting out of the Foundation and the Foundation shutting down, that the DAO starts taking over that responsibility. In two weeks, I will start posting on the forum about what that all looks like. What are we running here? Why is it built this way? What are the different costs, and how will we fund this and structure funding this in the DAO?. Are we going to look at the cost for the last 30 days, and that is the amount you get for the following month? What kind of guarantees does the Protocol want to have? Maybe we can have a multi-sig where the Protocol can claw back that funding at any time. How do we want to handle the case when some of those crazy days and the gas spikes to 2000 or something? It is Black Thursday levels. I\u2019m sure that we spent like 200K in a day for Oracles on Black Thursday. Can we have some kind of emergency fund to which the Core Unit may not have access on its own? Still, it doesn\u2019t need a ridiculous amount of facilitators to approve being able to pull any funding from that? How do we want to handle the accountability auditing of this? You want to make sure that no one is pulling out money on the side from this stuff, so we probably need a token flow kind of analysis where you can see the flow of funds. If you ever see funds that are not going to the Oracle transaction, you need to have an alert that signals a potential fraud. These are all questions that I have some ideas about. Still, I really want to get feedback to see how the Community feels more comfortable handling this. This will be the final step in fully decentralizing the Oracles, which will be completely controlled and funded by the Protocol.   Questions  Lucas: The main cost is gas, right? A good thing is it\u2019s very easy to audit that team is spending this money on gas because it\u2019s probably a known number of wallets. So I believe we should find a solution where monitoring gas costs is easy, and if it\u2019s running low, then more ETH could be made available.  Nick: I\u2019m not worried about the auditing being too complex.  I really want there to be an auditing component from the Gecko because I don\u2019t want to set this precedent where the DAO is handing big buckets of money and trusting people without the corresponding kind of transparency. We are doing a giant social experiment with our DAO here, and we want to do things right.     Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 20:59  We\u2019re publishing the final UNI LP Liq 2.0 parameters. Our proposal is in the final internal review. It should be posted tomorrow morning. We are also finalizing SUSHI LP collateral evaluations. As Chris said, they could be onboarded right after the final Liq 2.0 collaterals are implemented in about two weeks. We also updated our quarterly budget because the thing got changed a bit in our proposal. You can also get some information on the tools we\u2019ve been working on in the last couple of weeks. I\u2019m going to share two links here in the chat. First, we made a web dashboard that tracks risk metrics for each collateral type in Maker real-time. I\u2019ll try to make another forum post on this topic soon, explaining the roadmap behind this product. Second, we started calling the Maker Risk web app. Finally, as Chris mentioned, we had 3.2 million worth of BTC liquidated yesterday under the new Liquidation system. It was the biggest Liquidation so far. The outcome was promising. All of the debt got cleared as expected. The settlement time of auctions was between 40 and 45 minutes. This means that slippage, which is also partially a function of keepers profits that they made, was small, between 1% to 5%. That was good to see. The amounts that were bought, the so-called takes, were also very high nominal numbers. Keepers even used flash loan collateral type of auction buying, and I think SushiSwap was involved in an instant transaction.   Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 23:40  We have pushed two risk assessments in the forum. The first one is about trade finance by @williamr and the second one is revenue-based financing published by @Philinje. In addition, we want to publish the people company risk assessment as well, but that might be pushed to next week. This means you will have 3 or 4 credible asset criteria to evaluate in the following weeks. Currently, the expected date to be pushed on Mainnet is the second week of June. We\u2019re also working on the trust structure. Matthew published all the documents for the trust research. We are also working on the trust side with SolarX and Reino and making some progress there. I published a new budget for RWF.   Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 25:14  As I mentioned last week, we have started to reach out to other networks because we see a big opportunity here to have DAI in other networks. For example, we are thinking about how to do a campaign with BitPay, which integrated DAI last week but without worrying about the gas fees. That is usually a problem when you are reaching out to retail. So we think that we should do something with these sidechains, L2 networks, or other blockchains. We are starting conversations with all of them and see what we can do with them. We are also working on identifying different use cases for DAI. I posted a list of the use cases we are working on. We want to identify the value proposition of DAI or the Maker Protocol or the vaults in each case. But if you have any ideas or want to help us create this, let us know, and we will be happy to work with you. I have an announcement to make: We have a new member of our team, and I\u2019m super excited about this. You may be asking yourself why Mariano Conti is back on the call. He is joining us as a DeFi advisor. We thought we wanted to do more things with the DeFi projects, we want to work closer to all the other protocols, we want more ideas, and we think Mariano is the best for that.  Mariano Conti: I never left DeFi, and the past few months, I\u2019ve been working with a lot of projects, a lot of protocols, extending the network. Seeing how the Smart Contracts team is really well managed with so many amazing people doesn\u2019t make sense for me to go back to programming. Still, here I get to help out Maker differently, but I think in a very important way. I want to help out the BD team get DAI to as many places as possible, incorporating it from day one into so many of the new protocols and projects that have been coming out and will come out. I\u2019m really excited about this!     Content Production Core Unit Update  Seth Goldfarb 29:45  If we haven\u2019t met, I am Seth. I\u2019m facilitating the Content Production Core Unit. In the past weeks, we\u2019ve contributed to the production of Maker relay episodes 43 and 44 in collaboration with Gov- Comms. In addition, we\u2019ve met with the CPA and started the incorporation process and onboarding with Opolis. We reached out to a couple of CPAs, and I wasn\u2019t thrilled with the responses that we got from them, so if anybody knows any CPA based in the US, please help us out. We\u2019ve worked on creating a transparency dashboard on our notion page. We\u2019re working on getting that synced up with the domain to soon be on content.makerdao.network. Along with that, we worked on outlining content strategies and OKRs. The summary of that is that in the short-term, we want to focus on understanding the different journeys stakeholders take when they first learn about MakerDao and then become more involved. We want to optimize our digital properties to move that traffic along and educate people and get them the answers they need to make decisions that help us. Part of that strategy would be hosting some webinars. They\u2019re going to be bi-weekly. One of them will focus on giving integration partners a platform so that we can highlight what they are doing and give people who are interested in building with DAI a chance to learn more about what the process looks like. The long-term goal is to create a MakerDao brand. If you have a strong brand, people trust you, and you have customer loyalty. Branding is tricky because it can be difficult to measure the strength of your brand, but we are going to do what we can to find some ways to bring transparency about that. Please go read that and give us feedback. We also met SES to start coordinating about managing and updating the community portal. We want to figure out how to organize the content of the community portal. It is on a good site, and it does better SEO-wise than the content in the domain itself.   Questions  Seth: Brand is ultimately an expression to say why you do what you do. When you are talking to potential partners, it\u2019s easier for them to relate to the intentions behind what you\u2019re doing. Our thoughts on how to approach that is to focus on giving people opportunities to express the why. Having organic conversations instead of forcing people to say one thing.  Wouter: We have a lot of documentation lying around different places. Much of the technical documentation and also some in the content and community portal. At one point, we\u2019d love to sit with you guys and get all the documents into the right places so that onboarding members to the ecosystem can easily find the information.     Operational Support Update  Juan Guill\u00e9n 35:54  It was an intense week on several fronts for Core Units. We will have several calls coming up to present the Core Units. One of them is Marcomms from Kathleen Chu, the other one is Oracles with Nick Kunkel. In addition, we will have Collateral Onboarding with Monkey Irish, and I\u2019ll be happy to have Prose as the new facilitator for Governance Alpha. Stay tuned for that. Regarding the Core Unit informal submission, I\u2019m not sure if the one in the strategic Marcomms goes to RFC automatically or stays until the end of the cycle. Still, there are new Core Units in RFC. We have Oracles, as Nick mentioned. We have the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit. And we have the Strategic Happiness Core Unit by Mr. Bourbon and Prose as the Gov Alpha facilitator. There are new budgets for Risk, Alpha, and SES that are quite interesting to read. Regarding interesting posts, we have the Help Identifying Risks and Opportunities published by SES. If you see any risks or opportunities that MakerDAO should be pursuing, please help us identify them to do something about them. There are two posts regarding the Maker Compensation Guidelines. One is the Pre-MIP discussion and MIP 53 by PlanetX and the other one is an alternative for the Maker compensation plan by SES   MIPs Update  David Utrobin 38:18  1431\u00d7770 90.3 KB   1407\u00d7757 104 KB   1412\u00d7767 163 KB   1405\u00d7768 98.3 KB   1388\u00d7733 112 KB   1388\u00d7738 103 KB   1400\u00d7738 130 KB   1409\u00d7762 181 KB   1397\u00d7740 92.2 KB   1392\u00d7740 119 KB   1412\u00d7756 135 KB   1401\u00d7754 107 KB   Submission Review  LongForWisdom 44:40  I covered this already in the Governance update section. We saw four of the six inclusion polls passed. The ones that passed were MIP50, the Direct Deposit Module, the SES Core Unit MIP set including budget, mandate, facilitator, the MIP0 clarity amendments, and MIP51. To clarify, the MIP51 on the Governance cycle will only come into effect, assuming the rest of this cycle is successful. It hopefully will be, and I don\u2019t have many reasons to expect it won\u2019t be, but technically it\u2019s not locked in until that date. Same for the other proposals. The two polls that failed were the Strategic Marcomms Core Unit and the MIP49 Stacking Reward. As I mentioned before, those will either go back to RFC or be dropped, depending on what the authors decide.   Open Discussion 46:32  MIP49  SamM: I\u2019d like to talk about MIP49, which didn\u2019t pass. Here\u2019s an exit poll that Payton set up. We\u2019re trying to figure out why people were unsatisfied with the MIP. I heard some concerns around PAX efficiency, US security laws, and locking periods. If you are a \u201cNO\u201d voter, please explain yourself to address those concerns. However, I would still like to proceed with the MIP as we have a prisoner\u2019s dilemma. MKR holders are not personally and financially incentivized to lock their MKR into Governance. Delegation may mitigate this, but in the long-term, it still requires solving.  Nik Kunkel: As someone who has their MKR on AAVE, the only reason it is rational to do that is that there\u2019s a spread between what it costs to borrow money and the yield you can get with that money. The only reason that spread exists is that people really like governance shitcoins; they place a lot of value on them. That is not sustainable. Governance shitcoins are still shitcoins. Right now, we are in a market cycle where it is very popular to value Governance shitcoins, but it\u2019s not sustainable. As soon as the yield disappears, there won\u2019t be a reason to keep your MKR on AAVE, and the problem disappears. That makes it a short-term problem. I never understood with your proposal that it doesn\u2019t get anyone to vote more; it doesn\u2019t secure the hat; it just tries to get MKR off AAVE. With delegation, you actually secure the hat. People won\u2019t delegate to those who don\u2019t end up voting. So, with delegation, you do get more MKR on the hat; you do increase the system\u2019s security rather than worry about how you decrease the pointiness of the stick that is coming from AAVE. LongForWisdom: Nik, your first statement is that it\u2019s a short-term problem. You\u2019re correct in that the yield from AAVE is short-term. The issue is there\u2019s always going to be an opportunity cost for capital, e.g., when you lock up capital in governance in Maker, you can\u2019t use it for something else. It stops you from borrowing against it, taking credit for it, or potentially investing in other things. In this way, it\u2019s not just the yield, there\u2019s also the opportunity cost, and I don\u2019t think that problem goes away in the future. SamM: That\u2019s basically my view as well.   Nik Kunkel: I wonder how many people who have their MKR on AAVE are using it to pocket the spread off of the difference to borrowing dollars and farming versus doing what you\u2019re suggesting: borrowing and using it for leverage.  LongForWisdom: I suspect it\u2019s mostly towards yield at the moment, but it\u2019s not always going to be true. The other thing to consider is that Governance is an opportunity cost in time and attention for those who want to do things actively. So they are paying a cost to doing that. SamM: People who are loaning their MKR on AAVE for whatever reason are effectively socializing the cost of security to the rest of the holders. The idea behind MIP49 is to correct that sort of imbalance. You can loan out your MKR on AAVE, and if the opportunities dry up, we turn it off. But I suspect they\u2019ll continue in some form, and then I\u2019d like to have a tool to combat that.   Nik Kunkel: Can we convince AAVE to stop the borrowing of MKR?  SamM: If we do have this antagonistic approach, I think another competitor will pop up. Nik Kunkel: I\u2019ve heard you bring that argument before, but I doubt there will be another AAVE that just pops up out of nowhere. Compound hates us; they\u2019re not listing MKR. Brian McMichael: I\u2019m not sure what the difference is between MKR on AAVE and MKR just sitting idle in a wallet. Kurt Barry: MKR on AAVE can be borrowed and used to attack the system, whereas MKR in a wallet can\u2019t. I think that\u2019s the root of the concern. Nik Kunkel: It\u2019s like saying that flat flash loans are bad because they let everyone do this one thing. There are already people who have enough MKR to make a Governance attack right now to Brian\u2019s point. Whether the attack is broadly possible by many people versus some people, still the attack is possible because we can\u2019t secure the hat. SamM: There\u2019s a big difference between you owning the MKR and you borrowing the MKR. You have exposure to MKR, the asset if you own it, and you don\u2019t have exposure to it if you borrow it. Nik Kunkel: There are other ways to do that without having to sell into liquidity, e.g., you can open up a short to hedge. SamM: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same thing as you have to maintain the MKR for the entire duration of the vote. LongForWisdom: That\u2019s kind of a separate problem which we should address at some point, with time locks or some other method. Kurt Barry: You have to remember here that it\u2019s always possible to build permissionless derivatives for stake tokens. It\u2019s what happened to ETH 2.0, which was supposed to be proof of stake and not delegated proof of stake. Now they\u2019re staking derivatives that give instant liquidity on something that was supposed to be locked. There is some discount for that, but it\u2019s not huge. The question is, do we really solve the problem long-term, or are we just solving it for a couple of years until people decide to build locked MKR derivatives that are liquid and get you 90% of what it would be if we didn\u2019t have the rewards and locking? SamM: I addressed that in the post. The amount of effort required to make a liquid derivative and adopted by AAVE is a much higher effort than what it would take for us to blacklist that token from the rewards.   Kurt Barry: How does that blacklisting process work exactly? I would need to think through the game theory a bit more before I totally buy that that solves the problem. What if people start building Tornado Cash mixers-type things. Obviously, if people would have to go that far, it would reduce those really willing to do it. It might still be valuable, but I need to think more about it.  LongForWisdom: It\u2019s definitely not trivial to map out the impact. Personally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s beneficial. Nik Kunkel: Greg mentioned that it seemed there were large MKR holders who might be interested in delegating their MKR. Greg DiPrisco: When talking to the large voters, I found they will delegate to people who participate when given the option. This will account for a significant portion of the MKR. SamM: It\u2019s a great solution for getting voting up and getting more MKR on the hat, but I think it\u2019s a separate issue. Nik Kunkel: So what\u2019s the issue you\u2019re trying to solve here? If you can secure the Protocol, nothing else matters. SamM: Fundamentally, it\u2019s the prisoner\u2019s dilemma. Individuals are encouraged to defect from securing the Protocol by moving MKR somewhere else. Nik Kunkel: But if you delegate, the Protocol is secure. SamM: Yes, this could work in the short-term for a while. I\u2019m concerned about the long-term. LongForWisdom: As I said before, people are not always rational. Delegation may work forever, and that would be fine\u2026 Nik Kunkel: Are we dealing with imaginary problems? Let\u2019s deal with the problems in front of us. There won\u2019t be a problem magically showing up from one week to the next that we can\u2019t see. SamM: I agree with that. I think we should give the delegation a shot. I wanted to get ahead of this, but I\u2019m ok with seeing how things go. LongForWisdom: As you say, maybe not now, but I would expect those who are actively governing the Protocol to implement this at some point. They are paying this cost on behalf of everyone now. So it\u2019s in their best interest to implement something, and they have all the voting power as well. Brian McMichael: In the future, we can implement a solution with retroactive airdrops that would scan the chain for voting participants and build a Merkle distributor. That way, it\u2019s cheap for us, and everyone can just claim rewards. It\u2019s a bit manual, but there are alternative solutions available too. Payton Rose: What scares me about those solutions is they\u2019re not tied to how well the Protocol is doing. One of the things I liked about this was that staking rewards only got when we were otherwise burning MKR. So from a Governance perspective, I thought it was important to establish that rewarding was directly tied to how well the Protocol is doing and not to people deciding to vote to give themselves more capital. Brian McMichael: Within a retroactive airdrop, you would have a history to know if they voted well or not. Payton Rose: But then you could get up it more and more because it\u2019s not tied to performance. David Utrobin: Can\u2019t you tie the value of the airdrop to the performance? LongForWisdom: The difficult part is judging which votes are positive. Brian McMichael: You don\u2019t want to pick winners. You don\u2019t want to punish people for voting the wrong way. Christopher Mooney: They punish themselves because they\u2019re not getting a big airdrop if they voted the wrong way. Brian McMichael: That\u2019s a whole new game. Trying to predict what the majority is going to choose is a horrible way to do democracy. So anyway, I\u2019m not filling out a MIP for retroactive airdrops. LongForWisdom: That\u2019s clear. Let\u2019s move to some other topics.     Core Unit Onboarding Process  Frank Cruz: Since I was one pushing for the MarComms Core Unit, my campaign didn\u2019t go so well but if you get to see this video, stay positive, come back, bounce, listen to the Community and make a presentation with Juan\u2019s \u201cTV show\u201d to explain what exactly you are going to do. We\u2019ll run another campaign and hopefully get it passed next time.  Juan Guill\u00e9n: We are already in talks to organize the \u201cTV show.\u201d We want to make sure that everyone can provide feedback and ask the questions they want to. Christopher Mooney: We need to come up with a better process for this because many people were concerned with elements of their proposal, and that\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s nearly impossible for a group like that to negotiate with the DAO without everyone\u2019s emotions getting enraged. When we - Protocol Engineering - went through this with our proposal, it was a distraction and bordering on the edge of a counterproductive process, not to mention what would\u2019ve happened if it hadn\u2019t passed. If a proposal doesn\u2019t pass, we need a method that doesn\u2019t burn a potential team to the ground. Maybe a more in-person or video-oriented approach would be better. I\u2019m concerned that this will happen with other teams, teams that we need or want. We should negotiate on better terms with them, including Protocol Engineering or any other teams. David Utrobin: One idea that I had for a better methodology before a Core Unit goes through the whole MIP ratification process was to use the weekly cycle to run some polls to get some sentiment and feedback from MKR holders earlier on. This would be very powerful.   LongForWisdom: Wouter, can you talk about how the incubator can make this process better?  Wouter: The Governance process takes a lot of time and requires much commitment to go through. You essentially need three months to get through the process: one month crafting the proposal, one month of RFC, and one month of Formal Submission. Only then do you learn whether you are out of the job or your proposal has passed, and you can start working on the thing that you\u2019ve been committed to for three months. It works at the moment but is very intense. It works because we have many people involved in the DAO through the Foundation, and they have built some confidence. For external teams trying to participate in the Maker economy, it\u2019s just not reasonable. Hopefully, the incubator pattern applied by many Core Units is important because people can start getting paid, get to know the team, get better guidance so that their proposal is in line with the culture and the expectations of the Community. Because it\u2019s typically the people who haven\u2019t been directly engaging with the Community that has trouble bringing the proposal in a way that makes for a strong argument to the audience. It also means that the business model would make sense because the incubator would support those teams to build a business model that makes sense in the DAO in an environment known by the supporting crew. Finally, the reputation of the incubator will mean that projects are unlikely to pass-fail fast. The incubator\u2019s reputation can really help create more certainty that a team is set up for success and that the vote will pass. There can be enough signals throughout the process so that the vote becomes almost a formality. This is why incubators are absolutely critical for the growth and the success of the Maker ecosystem.     Diversification of Core Unit holdings  David Utrobin: There was a question on Core Units diversifying their treasuries. If the Protocol gives them DAI upfront, Protocol Engineering mentioned turning some of it into USDC or potentially holding ETH. I was curious about people\u2019s thoughts on that.  LongForWisdom: That\u2019s not something I\u2019d want to manage for GovAlpha in addition to everything else we do. SamM: To clarify, the Protocol Engineering team wants to turn the Emergency Fund partially into USDC in the event of a protocol failure. I don\u2019t want to give a wrong idea to the Community. David Utrobin: My bad for the misunderstanding! Brian McMichael: In an Emergency Shutdown, DAI essentially becomes ETH in USDC based on relative proportions. Kurt Barry: My suggestion was that maybe the DAO as a whole would hold and stake ETH, or should have some financial planning around that, so we get income denominated in ETH. This is great because gas costs are very variable. So the DAO would get resources to fund on-chain activities of various Core Units. Right now, we let everything sit in the Surplus Buffer. Still, it\u2019s worth considering different capital structures to ensure smooth operating ability through various market conditions. Brian McMichael: The other reason why we might want to diversify is that we spent the last year fighting DAI above peg, so instead of having it sit on balance sheets, we might want to release it into the world. David Utrobin: So it makes sense from a Protocol security perspective so that we are not too reliant on DAI. On the other side, for Core Units to hold their budget in alternative assets, it\u2019s a whole different story, and nobody is considering that too seriously, right? Christopher Mooney: Yes, that\u2019s correct. The whole point of the emergency funds is for teams to keep operating after a black swan effect. If DAI goes to zero, or fails in some way, or becomes highly volatile, we can\u2019t guarantee any kind of cleanup or handling. It\u2019s probably supercritical for Operations, Protocol Engineering, Oracles. I\u2019ll probably need to think about this. Brian McMichael: We can consider a situation where an emergency shutdown is triggered, DAI effectively becomes ETH, and then market FUD drops the ETH price, making us unable to fund anyone. Kurt Barry: Although I\u2019ll say that given one of our other common black swan concerns is regulatory action. If all of a sudden the order comes down, all Maker Protocol teams are blacklisted, and USDC shuts off those emergency funds. It would be nice if there were another decentralized stablecoin in that scenario. Someone was suggesting RAI. Christopher Mooney: RAI doesn\u2019t cut it because it would probably suffer from the same black swan bug in the Marker Protocol. Nik Kunkel: It\u2019s also pegged to ETH. Kurt Barry: Maybe something like Curve LP tokens would be a better hedge. You\u2019re still partially exposed to DAI, but that\u2019s fine if it doesn\u2019t fail completely.   Christopher Mooney: For anyone listening to this, we have a lot of confidence in the teams, in the Protocol, and its safety. This is just making sure the airplane stays in the air by having treasury backup systems.  Brian McMichael: Yes. We spend a lot of time thinking about all of the things that can go wrong. You don\u2019t have to, but sometimes they make it into public discourse. LongForWisdom: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about confidence. If everything explodes, then at least you will have people who are going to try to clean up and make sure you get some of what you are ordering. Without that guarantee, everything explodes, and then everyone is on the road. Kurt Barry: We currently have the luxury of worrying about these crazy black swan events rather than dealing with immediate emergencies. Things are going well enough that we can spend our time thinking about the worst-case scenarios. Nadia: I understand what you\u2019re saying, but how would we look if someone saw our smart contracts team using USDC as an emergency fund just if DAI fails? It\u2019s complicated from a business point of view when trying to convince someone to integrate the Maker Protocol. Derek: We\u2019ve been looking at it from a risk perspective, so we wouldn\u2019t put all the funds in one particular collateral type. There would be a balance, but we\u2019re yet to assess what that balance would look like. Is it LP tokens, a basket of stablecoins, an index? I\u2019m almost certain that DAI will play a role in that. We\u2019re talking about a fund here that doesn\u2019t get used for monthly payments; it\u2019s something that will hopefully never be touched. If there is, we have that stability there through having some index of funds or a broad distribution of collateral types. I don\u2019t think anyone would look at this as not having confidence in the product that we\u2019re building. It\u2019s a long-term perspective for stability in just-in-case scenarios to cover off that risk. Juan: It\u2019s also a very small percentage. Wouter: The bigger issue here is that people are seeing things they\u2019re not used to seeing with traditional companies because all of this is in the open. If a bank hedges against its own stock, you won\u2019t read about it. We discuss it in these calls because we are an open community. It can suddenly become a headline in Coindesk. It\u2019s a tricky thing in marketing and PR, but I think that the right way to deal with it is to explain it. Maybe separate the emergency discussions from the more accessible discussions and clarify that this is standard operations. You should be worried if we weren\u2019t be doing that. It would be a bad reflex to stop building fire exits because it reminds people that it could be a fire. It\u2019s definitely a challenge. We\u2019ve seen this in the past, where a purely procedural safety thing was completely taken out of context and seen as a weakness instead of proper and responsible risk management.   Frank Cruz: Shoutout to Greg for his move and all of the assets he\u2019ll bring into the Protocol.  Greg DiPrisco: I started a company that intends to bring institutional borrowers to the Protocol. It\u2019s been exciting to see the first crop of borrowers get in, but this gives us a path to expand. I\u2019ll do to differentiate myself by focusing on the safety of the Protocol and making sure the structures and counterparties are top-tier to make it easy for MKR holders to approve these assets. I\u2019ll also be asking for some big DC, so keep your eyes open.

As usual, I\u2019m joined by many Maker folks and/or others interested in governance. We\u2019ve got an agenda to get through; We have our regular updates. We also have our standard monthly financial presentation from SebVentures. This is meant to be an interactive meeting. Feel free to interrupt and ask questions. We\u2019d love to hear from you. We had two executives pass this week. These were last week\u2019s executives, which lowered the PSM fee out from 0.1 to 0.04 percent. Also included in that executive was onboarding UNI-V2-DAI-USDT liquidity pool tokens. We increased the ETH-A and ETH-B stability fees slightly to 5.5 percent and nine percent, respectively. We also had an out-of-schedule executive on Monday because we\u2019re concerned that if the market did take a turn for the bearish, we potentially wouldn\u2019t have enough stablecoin facility available in the case that people wanted to close out their vaults pushed to demand DAI increase. This was mainly out of caution. Hopefully, we won\u2019t need to worry about it for the time being. For clarity\u2019s sake, the executive increased the PSM USDCA DC to one billion and reduced the USDCA DC to zero. We had another set of polls this week. We had ETH-C onboarding, another ETH collateral vault with a higher liquidation ratio but a lower stability fee. It passed. We also had a poll to increase the ETH-A target available debt, known as the gap from 30 million to 80 million. We had seen that the ETH-A vault was maxed out temporarily in periods of high demands. Increasing the available target debt should reduce the number of situations where that situation can occur. Also, a collection of auction parameter updates had passed. There\u2019s quite a lot in there. Nonetheless, some parameter tweaks keep auctions happening efficiently and allow us to auction more collateral in a shorter amount of time. Finally, we had a poll to make a statement that MakerDAO supports the EIP1559, which we\u2019ve discussed over the last few calls. This is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that should benefit the entire ecosystem.  Chris: Except for miners. LongForWisdom: Well, maybe not miners, at least immediately.   The executive this week will include the ETH-A gap change. It will consist of the auction parameter updates. It won\u2019t include ETH-C. Also, we should have RWA001 onboarding, which is the 6S facility. I\u2019ll let Chris discuss that in detail later. In terms of governance alpha or domain updates, we\u2019ve been continually working on SourceCred. There are a couple of tweaks we want to make, which we\u2019re working through at the moment. Work is also continuing on the MIPs portal that we showed off a couple of weeks back. Hopefully, we\u2019ll be continuing work on the parameter documentation, specifically around the introduction of Liquidations 2.0. We want to have the major Liquidations 2.0 parameters documented for governance when they need to vote on them. We also discussed improving the readability of MIP0 and helping make the MIPs process more accessible, which led to action points that we\u2019re going to be working on over the next few weeks. We had spent a few days brainstorming on the executive copy that goes up with the executive votes attempting to make it more readable and efficient in terms of where important things are placed. Hopefully, we will use that this week and no one will hate it. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.    Weekly Updates  Governance at a Glance  Peyton Rose 06:16  Three-Point Summary  Another week, another ATH for DAI Supply! Currently sitting just north of 2.5B.

Smart Contracts Team  Christopher Mooney 10:02  We didn\u2019t do any work on collateral assessments. No collateral to Kovan this week. Last week we mentioned that we put MIP21 on Kovan and that we were working on tooling. However, we have developments on MIP45, which is Liquidations 2.0. We received the interim audit reports for Gauntlet, PWC, and Quantstamp. We shared the results with those teams to help them think outside of where they were currently looking. They could get ideas from each other\u2019s reports. We also responded to those reports and shipped a release candidate into the liquidations Liq-2.0 branch on GitHub in the Dss repo. All of those audit teams have the responses to their audit reports, and I should also mention that Trail of Bits has started their audit. They have the updated release candidate as well. Trail of Bits is slightly behind our schedule. Also, we\u2019re prepping Liquidations 2.0 to go to Kovan for next week. Right now, it looks like we\u2019re going to ship it with LINK as the first collateral type. If there are any objections or feedback to that, I\u2019ve reached out to the various stakeholders. We think LINK is one of the better candidates to test with. There\u2019s lots of coordination work happening behind the scenes on Liquidations 2.0 among other teams. There has been a lot of working with the Foundations integrations team toward working on the Keeper and the contracts\u2019 reference implementation. Also, marketing and messaging, thank you to everybody. Thanks to everybody that\u2019s participating. Derek: I can do a quick plug, Chris. There are two MIP submissions. One is the smart contract MIP39 core unit application. This one is in RFC. In this MIP, I cover responsibilities, team philosophy, and our proposed mandate, which covers many topics, including security and safety of protocol, engagement with the community, collateral onboarding, protocol growth, protocol evolution around adding new functionality. We also include research and development along with tooling and automation initiatives. That\u2019s the first MIP that defines the mandate, as you guys know. Then, the second MIP generated a whole lot of really great for and against discussion in the forum today. I put it up last night. This is the smart contract MIP40 budget application, which is also in RFC. This documents the budget to support the team mandate. I\u2019ve included rationale around what went into this proposal, which led to it at a high level. It\u2019s for a team of 10 to 14 employees. It covers all operational costs, audits, overheads, those sorts of things. It includes a DAI budget as well as an MKR vesting proposal. Nonetheless, remember, it\u2019s still in RFC, so we want as much discussion over the following month to align with what the community is comfortable with. We all want to explain, break it down, and give more explanation where needed before we lodge it for formal submission at the end of the month.  LongForWisdom: Thank you, Derek. Chris, did you want to show the Liquidation 2.0 timeline now? Chris: Sure. Let me just share my screen. Wouter, did you want to make any comments in particular about this? Wouter: I think you already mentioned most things.      Chris: Here we are today on the fourth. You can see the final reports for Gauntlet and PWC are expected on Friday. We\u2019ve got another final report on Monday from QuantStamp. There\u2019s Kovan deployment on Monday or next week. This gives you an idea of the array of things happening around Liquidations 2.0. Anyone with governance expertise should fact-check our timeline for governance here.   Oracle Team  Nik Kunkel 19:44  The team has been making a lot of progress lately. In particular, we have a new testing staging framework that is more scalable and thorough than before. We can spin up a new type of staging environment on the fly. In parallel, they have their own chain and their own grafana dashboard, which gives us a much more granular view of testing things before we send them to live. This technical debt has been building up for quite some time. I am thrilled that we were able to knock that down. Now, we have four different oracle builds that are being tested in parallel.  First is a patched version of Scuttlebutt that fixes the state size issue. For those of you who recall, back in November, we had a brief oracle outage due to the state size limitation in Scuttlebutt. after it hits a particular state, it just falls over and dies. After doing some research, we realized there is no reason for this state size issue to exist. It\u2019s a hardcoded value deep in the Scuttlebutt code. We\u2019ve bumped up that value. There have been thorough testing to see if anything would break or if any dependencies are limited or affected by the state size. We\u2019ve been testing this for about six weeks, and everything looks good. Second is a tool called the Gofer tool. It\u2019s made to minimize our dependency on any single component in the Oracle stack. This design\u2019s goal is to have redundant components for every piece of the Oracle stack. If ever there is a bug or a single tool fails, it ensures a redundant backup. Now, what is Gofer? It\u2019s a pricing tool that we use to get the prices of assets, and it serves as redundancy for an existing tool that we\u2019ve called sensor. The third deployment that we\u2019ve had is a tool called Spire. Spire integrates lib p2p into the oracles. Lib p2p is a peer-to-peer gossip type of network. It\u2019s a redundancy to Scuttlebutt. As you see, we have this theme of redundancy, redundancy, and redundancy that\u2019s been code complete for quite some time. Sablier is in staging as well. Finally, we have the Starkware L2 oracle that we did last week. That\u2019s gonna be live with DyDx mainnet launch, which is coming up soon. We have a ton of releases coming up.   Even though we haven\u2019t had a problem with the oracles\u2019 reliability, I think it\u2019s good knowing that we\u2019ll have that redundancy on the LP oracle. We still have to go through it with a fine-tooth comb. Currently, there were no critical issues. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t seem it\u2019ll need a complete redesign or anything drastic like that. They found some math-related issues in terms of overflows or something. We\u2019ll have to patch those up. The idea is that we\u2019d fix those issues or make our case for why we don\u2019t think that they\u2019re important to resubmit to ABDK. Then they would create a final audit report that can then be published to the community. That would be one of the blockers for raising the DC of the LP tokens out of the way. Over time, we\u2019ve discovered other blockers, such as participation in the liquidation auctions for LP tokens that haven\u2019t been what we expected them to be. So far, with the current DC, it\u2019s ok. However, raising the DC with the current lack of participation in these liquidation pool auctions is dangerous. we need to come up with a plan around that Concerning LP tokens, there\u2019s a lot of liquidity in Curve. I\u2019ve looked from a design perspective regarding what needs to happen. It\u2019s actually quite simple; we need to write custom code calling a function that Curve has already made, audited, and battle-tested. I don\u2019t think that should take too long. We\u2019re still working on the Core Unit Proposal. However, keep in mind the gas costs. The foundation has been spending an enormous sum of gas on the oracles. When gas costs are 300 GWEI to 500 GWEI, you can be spending thousands of dollars on gas in a day. In response, we lowered the sensitivity of the oracles. We did this for the vault types with relatively low DAI minted against them because that\u2019s safer. Hence, ETH and WBTC were completely untouched. others were lowered from 1% to about 4% sensitivity. Still, given the higher collateralization ratios for many of those assets in our conversations with the Risk Team, it seems this change shouldn\u2019t have an outsized effect on the risk that protocol was taking in terms of collateral risk with liquidations. In conclusion, this has cut down our oracle costs concerning the gas expenditure. I don\u2019t have hard numbers yet, but it seems to be in better shape by looking at the update frequency. I can give a formal report and strategy plan regarding gas prices fairly soon.  LongForWisdom: I think everyone is excited to see the Uniswap tokens and orders to be done on the Uniswap oracles. Great news.     Risk Team  Primoz Kordez 29:23  We agreed to focus on RWAs and Liquidations 2.0 within the coming weeks regarding collateral onboarding mandated actors. This means we have to delay onboarding other collateral for a short period. Therefore, we didn\u2019t do any collateral evaluations. However, we did make a few proposals during the previous week. We proposed auction parameters, which Maker voters supported. I have reached out to various keepers, such as Keeper DAO, to let keepers know about these changes. Hopefully, this will attract more of them. Regarding Niks\u2019 concerns, we hope that higher back values resulting in minimum bid increase and lower duration times of auctions could attract more keepers to bid on UNI LPs. We can\u2019t be sure until we test it. It\u2019s difficult to say whether or not we are confident enough to increase DC. In comparison, we could increase the DC of UNI LPs with liquidations turned off, such as DAI-USDC, where auctions are not a significant concern. Marco released his research on wBTC last week; The findings justify an additional increase of the maximum DC for wBTC, currently at 330 million, to a proposed 500 million. This was mentioned in the recent signal request. However, we don\u2019t support the onboarding of lower liquidation ratio wBTC vaults because of risks related to the redemption cycle of wBTC and general high wBTC leverage in the Defi ecosystem. More than half of the wBTC supply is used for leverage. Due to lower liquidation, vaults such as ETH-B do not do well in auctions. This is why we proposed a delay of onboarding lower liquidation ratio wBTC until liquidations 2.0 is released. I proposed an urgent executive last week. We had a price drop in ETH. This caused some vault owners to deleverage. A lot of DAI liquidity was taken out of liquid venues such as Curve. Consequently, the PSM DC got fully utilized. Even USDC-A debt exposure began to increase because people were already shorting DAI, expecting us to react. This is why I proposed an urgent increase of PSM-USDC-A DC to 1 billion to distract speculators from minting DAI from USDC-A, which doesn\u2019t charge any fees. Lastly, we had a Rates Group on Monday. We decided not to increase for larger vault types because we had a price correction during the past two weeks. We don\u2019t want to overshoot the rates in case bear sentiment may continue. We decided not to propose any changes for the time being. However, we have the opportunity to react during the upcoming month if we begin seeing the continuation of this bull run and increased debt exposure, particularly on ETH-A vaults. We proposed a few rate changes, though, mainly for UNI LP vaults. We saw the fees being charged were not in line with the fees being charged on ETH vaults. Therefore, we decided to increase ETH LP pairs by 1%. We increased those rates because APY on UNI LPs is considerably higher than the current stability fees. The majority of the risk for UNI LP is currently in low participation of keepers in auctions. Hence, a higher fee makes sense from a risk perspective.  LongForWisdom: People were wondering if Vishesh will be joining us for the State of the Peg anytime soon? Primoz: I hope so. I have a call with him tomorrow. I will try to get more info on where he\u2019s hiding. David Utrobin: There\u2019s a version of State of the Peg that\u2019s done every week by our very own Tim Black, which is posted along with the Maker Relay.     Discussion  Frank Cruz: Quick question to Primoz regarding WBTC coming to DeFi. How does the Risk Team view this?  Primoz: Compared to Compound, we have less wBTC because they have a lower liquidation ratio which is currently increasing. In general, with wBTC, we did analyze counter-party risk. Marco points out that if something goes wrong with Bitgo and consequently with wBTC, it\u2019s a substantial systemic risk. The other risk concerns Maker related and the redemption cycle. We looked at how much time it took to burn wBTC and get Bitcoin on their address; It took a few hours, which could be one of the issues for Maker where we could have liquidations. The keeper could want to recycle capital. It takes six hours to get Bitcoin and transfer Bitcoin to exchanges and then convert it back to stablecoin. This is one of our main worries about Bitcoin to wBTC and trying to limit the DC. The other concern is that a lot of wBTC is used for leverage. When you\u2019re going to have these liquidations, typically, other platforms such as Compound and AAVE would probably liquidate first because they don\u2019t use OSM. a lot of wBTC liquidity could disappear. Then when Maker auctions start happening, it could be a problem for us. Frank Cruz: So you think that Bitcoin is far away from being a part of DeFi, in your opinion? Primoz: No, far from that. This part of DeFi is not on the same scale as Ether. Frank Cruz: Got it, thank you.     Real-World Finance  Sebastien Derivaux 39:16  On the collateral side, we are on starting to review the documents of 6S. MIP21 will be alive very soon. We have progressed in reviewing documents for ConsolFreight. They are similar to NewSilver because both criteria include Centrifuge. There will be a post in the forum next week. (Joking)Thanks to the Real World Asset airlines, you can go to Phuket. We received another collateral onboarding application for a tokenized real estate project. We made progress with the People\u2019s Company regarding the negotiation phase to reduce the protocol\u2019s risk. It\u2019s too risky for us concerning their initial proposition. We are trying to find a method allowing the deal to be easier for us. However, this deal is complex and may take more than a few months. There has been much discussion on many prospects for collaterals and the ones already in the pipeline. Also, there was work in the accounting infrastructure. I will present this later. However, it\u2019s still based on Dune Analytics. We have some problems with Dune because all the codes of functions that don\u2019t have parameters are not found in Dune Analytics. It was impossible to get the amount of DAI stored inside the DSR. As we increase the DSR, we want to have this information. We would like to use the Query application, but it\u2019s still in the early stages. However, it would help make more progress in this direction. If other core units are interested in having analytics on the on-chain data and team up together, it would be an exciting project for the Maker Foundation. However, it does use GraphQL, which is complicated. But if we can work through it, we can put some information into the database and get some helpful analytics. Lastly, we continue to work on scaling SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles), which we use to store real-world assets. But the issue we currently have is how can we be sure that people won\u2019t do anything wrong inside the SPVs. Right now, they are managed by the asset organizer. We have some solutions, although this space is very complex. We are working with the Centrifuge asset originator and all the parties to find the best solutions that are also cost-effective.   Operational Support Update  Juan 43:21  Amy is out of the office for the week. Regarding KYM, we haven\u2019t had anything yet. We are negotiating with Utraschuppi to get the Euro-DAI declaration of intent. As soon as he gets something going, we will publish it on the agenda. That\u2019s in the Know Your MIP section. We haven\u2019t had any calls for collateral onboarding because of what Chris and Seb mentioned regarding MIP21. However, Matt Rabinowitz posted the 6S state of the business. It\u2019s a very interesting post if you want to check it out. Regarding collaterals, Tadeo has made this cool visualization that Prose mentioned before. Operational Support Weekly Update: March 1-4, 2021 Synthetix replay from last week Gnosis replay from last week schuppi will soon present the EURDai Declaration of Intent. Stay tuned for the date! Will publish the agenda soon. mrabino1 has posted 6s State of the Business as we wait for MIP21 to go through the finish line. More collateral than onboarding, but Tadeo made this cool visualization that shows the collateral that\u2019s backing each Dai. You can follow live developments of Core Units on coreunit.makerdao.network  If you or someone you know might be a good fit, encourage them to check out Core Units I Wish Existed  Core Unit Launch Pod Sessions #1: Growth Core Unit already out! Check the video. Next Wednesday, March 10th, we\u2019ll have Session #2: Governance Alpha Core Unit. Join LongForWisdom, prose11, elihu, and blimpa on their plan to decentralize Governance. A little bit of action on the core units that are being proposed. Derek has already mentioned it, but he\u2019s proposing himself as a smart contract core unit facilitator. Hopefully, we can have him on one of these calls. Colter has proposed a draft for a swag MakerDAO store. Then we have Kathleen for strategic Marcomms. We also have Gov Comms with David Utrobin and Oracles with Nick. Many things are happening, and we\u2019re working towards making this transition as easy as possible. Are there any questions?  LongForWisdom: How many core units do we have now which are either proposed or in the process of being proposed? Juan: I think there are four. There are three informal submissions; Governance Alpha, Risk, and Real-World Finance, and then in RFC, we\u2019ve got Growth. We have a lot being drafted, but I don\u2019t know how long they will be in draft form. LongForWisdom: Cool. Nice to see things coming along so well. That\u2019s pretty awesome.     Community Development Team Update  Anna Kryukova 47:53  There are not many updates this week under community development. Many community members have been working on drafting more core units that we had done a retrospective on last week during the hackathon. Keep a lookout on the forum for any core units being proposed by community development.

Since we\u2019re back to doing governance cycles, I need to do the MIP submission review. I will briefly go over the same MIPs that they just went over. We have many informal submissions because there are many MIPs this month in the formal submissions. We\u2019re planning to group some of them as sets based on ease of use since they are functionally related. The first group will be keg MIPs, the streaming payments for the keg and streaming payments module. We\u2019re going to group the core unit framework MIPs and the amendments directly related to that. We have four separately; we have the terminating module, liquidations 2.0, parameter proposal groups, Maker DAO multisig wallet management. Some of those will go in individually. We also have the sets of sub proposals from each reward finance, risk, and gov-alpha. They will go in a group link of three groups, one for each of those core units. They all meet their requirements.   Other Presentations and Updates  Sebastien Derivaux  February Financials 57:42  1140\u00d7644 139 KB   1141\u00d7640 241 KB   Let\u2019s start with monthly results. As you can see, we\u2019re making great progress. Let\u2019s talk about net interest income. The difference between the stability fee we\u2019re earning and DSR is up 92% versus last month, which is insane. This is thanks to loan demand and higher stability fees proposed by the rate-setting group. Another interesting item is the net trading income, which is the  PSM. It\u2019s increasing as well, which means it\u2019s starting to become a new business line for Maker. The only drawback is that currently, we\u2019re only getting USDC inflows but no outflows. It is not perfect, but maybe this will soon change. Next is net liquidation income. January was quite volatile because there was a lot of liquidation. However, this was nothing compared to February. Let\u2019s hope that it doesn\u2019t repeat in March because we made a lot of liquidation money. Regarding the workforce expenses, it is getting bigger and bigger and will continue to increase. This month was the first interim multisig of monolithic expenses mainly related to PSM. There was also gas asked for smart contract development. It may have been an executive of last week. Nonetheless, there was an incoming donation from the donor. If many people want to give back to the Maker DAO, you can turn in your DAI to the interim multisig. Net income is increasing, and recurring income is a bit less because most of the increase was in trading and liquidation income. Those are not used in the recurring income. MKR price was not flat but instead showed a good increase, however not as much as the rest of the financial results   1143\u00d7644 142 KB   1136\u00d7641 288 KB   1140\u00d7643 177 KB   1143\u00d7643 141 KB   1137\u00d7642 137 KB   1138\u00d7645 273 KB   1141\u00d7641 263 KB   Someone: Sebastien, what did you say the target was for that CET-1 in banks? What do they typically shoot for?  Sebastien Derivaux: Banks should aim for 8%, but I wouldn\u2019t make any comparison at all between those two numbers because I didn\u2019t check insolvency in how to write the numbers. Obviously, when they made the norms, they weren\u2019t crypto-asset loans. Therefore, it\u2019s difficult to estimate, but you can try to use the leverage ratio. It should be 3% for banks. We\u2019re still a lot below that, but I don\u2019t think our business is as risky as a bank. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s something we need to work on. I try to see the brokers\u2019 model, such as interactive brokers, because they have the same balance sheets. They are making a lot of loans backed by stocks and bonds. Therefore, it\u2019s quite the same issue. It wasn\u2019t evident what models they were using, and there is not much to report. Still, obviously, their leverage ratio was higher. There is legislation in the US that if you want to be a broker and give your customers loans, you need to have a leverage ratio of 3%.     1137\u00d7641 218 KB   1140\u00d7640 155 KB   Discussion 01:15:49  Sebastien Derivaux: Does anyone have any questions or statements to make around this presentation?  Matthew Rabinowitz: Yeah, oracles make up more of that just because of the cost of gas to update them. Sebastien Derivaux: Yeah, I\u2019ve asked Nick about that just before the meeting. He didn\u2019t have a clear view, but it could be in the ballpark. Obviously, it depends on the price of the gas, and therefore it can change dramatically. Matthew Rabinowitz: If the amount of DAI outstanding was ten times greater, how much of these costs would be ten times higher, or what percent they are? Sebastien Derivaux: Let\u2019s say ETH and gas price remains the same. Expenses could end up being the same. Obviously, that doesn\u2019t work in real life, but you increase the expenses because you have more income. In conclusion, it\u2019s possible.   Matthew Rabinowitz: My point is it\u2019s a good exercise for every core unit team to ask for the budget today and ask what if everything grows 10X or another 10X. In those extreme cases, how much budget will you need to sustain? Oracles are probably one of the greatest examples where their budget really shouldn\u2019t change unless their business model changes. Marketing and real-world finance may change, but it\u2019s a question for each unit.  Sebastien Derivaux: It\u2019s super early because we don\u2019t have all the core units proposed yet. Juan: Matt, I was going to say the opposite; an oracle is the only one expected to go up if DAI is backed by other types of collateral types relative to smart contracts. It could go up to an estimated multiple of 3X. That would be healthy, at least for Brian and Chris, and the rest could grow slightly more. Still, I would expect the oracle parts to be the one that grows the most. Matthew Rabinowitz: Yeah, the operating expenses of the protocol aren\u2019t that much. The cost is the oracle itself if we keep everything the same. Obviously, we don\u2019t want to do it because we want to grow and do awesome things. Juan: Not so much yet.   Brian McMichael: I want to mention that smart contracts numbers came out. They factored for 14 devs tops, giving us space to add 4 or 5 new ones. If we do wanna grow past that, the plan is to prepare a package like one of the headcount packages that we can reintroduce to governance to approve at that time.  Sebastien Derivaux: Yeah, it\u2019s a good point. It\u2019s only the budget I took. Maybe some budgets have some room to grow.   Payton: I\u2019m taking a step back to the leverage ratio stuff. In your assessment, are we in a good spot? We\u2019re about halfway to raise the surplus buffer to 30 million. I\u2019m also curious if maybe including strategic reserves would help that number at all?  Sebastien Derivaux: Yes, that\u2019s a good question. I didn\u2019t find any clear answer yet. Actually, I was more focused on the liquidity side because there are two risk issues when you\u2019re doing banking. One is solvency; when your surplus buffer is negative, that\u2019s not good. You\u2019re minting and unsure about the feature and liquidity. When you go to your bank and say I want my money back, you can end up bankrupt. My first assumption was that it was impossible in Maker because, obviously, DAI is not redeemable for anything except at emergency shutdown. I found out that it\u2019s not correct at all. You can\u2019t redeem DAI, but what happened is that price of DAI change when you look at your bank account. You\u2019ve got one dollar in your bank account. It\u2019s always one dollar. There is not one dollar beyond that because banks don\u2019t have this one dollar. It\u2019s a loan to buy a house or anything else; usually, they have some liquidity reserves. In our case, liquidity reserves will be strategizing assets, mainly the PSM but other vaults, if you convert them to the PSM. Having this buffer is a curse and blessing. It\u2019s a curse because we take the regulatory risk of USDC. It\u2019s a blessing if all the DAI farming stops tomorrow and most people using DAI to farm want to go to USDC because they prefer USDC for any reason. There will be a lot of redeeming, and this buffer will help us to take the heat. We don\u2019t have to increase the stability fee in a rush or stuff like that. Even if you increase stability fees, it takes at least 2 days to be increased, probably more because the price of DAI can go below one dollar for maybe one week, which is not very good for our customers. Going back to the solvency issue, it\u2019s difficult to define a good number; what is safe, or what is not? I think it truly depends. At 1%, we will be safe if regulation 2.0 is solving most of the issue, and maybe we\u2019re even safe at a 25% alpha percentage. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have the number on top of my head. But if we had 1% last year, we would not have met the Black Monday event. However, no promises.

My name is Payton Rose; I go by @Prose11 on the Maker Forum. I\u2019m joined here by a bunch of awesome people interested in MakerDAO and how it\u2019s running. We like people to get involved and ask questions or comments, so please, do not be shy if you have something to say.   Weekly Updates  Governance  LongForWisdom 03:25  The executive vote passed last Friday. That was a day after last week\u2019s meeting. The executive lowered the flap auction bid duration and increased the DC on NS-Drop RWAs facility. There is a current executive vote currently up. Please, go vote. If you support adding the four RWA Vault types within it, then you should vote on that. There are also two ongoing polls. They are both community greenlight polls. One is for the Gelato-UNI-V2-DAI-USDC LP pair, and the other one is the Untangled Finance Drop token. Both of those close on Monday, August 2nd.  These polls will help us prioritize the domain work that needs to get done for those tokens. The other polls which concluded on Monday were the monthly MIPs ratification polls. We will be going over those during our MIPs update with David. The only other Governance update I have is that this week will not contain an executive. We had a post in the Forum last week discussing the consideration towards switching to bi-weekly executive schedules. We have not decided on that. However, when speaking to the other mandated actors, we did decide that when we don\u2019t need to put up an executive, it would probably be best not to force one up every week. An executive this week would have included some minor housekeeping changes from Protocol Engineering if there were to be an executive. We\u2019re just going to go ahead and batch that in with the following weeks.   GovAlpha Core Unit Update GovAlpha Weekly Update  Our main update is the vote delegation. We\u2019re essentially set to soft launch the UI for vote delegation on august 2nd. This means the UI will work. You\u2019ll be able to delegate, but we\u2019re not going to make a huge deal about it just yet because we still need to fix up some other things and improve the UI for the next version. Looking forward to that. The dUX and UX team have done a great job getting that setup and helping the first few delegates get themselves sorted. Huge thanks to them. We also had the first Meet Your Delegate meeting this week. It was on Wednesday at 18:00 UTC. That went super well and had a good turnout. We had @PaperImperium and @ElProgresso on there talking about the delegate platforms and answering questions. We will have the next Meet Your Delegate call next week at the same time on Wednesday, August 4th at 18:00 UTC. On that one, we\u2019ll have @timblack and @Planet_X talk about their delegate platforms. We are all looking forward to that. The only other highlight I have is that I\u2019ve assigned @Sebix the task of trying to sort out tags on the Maker forum. We use tags fairly often. In some cases, they\u2019re good, but in others, it\u2019s a little bit messy, and there\u2019s quite a lot of them. Without some housekeeping, they tend to get a bit unruly. We will try and organize them a little bit and figure out what goals we are trying to solve with tags. More information on this as it comes out.   Forum at a Glance  Eli 06:22 Forum at a Glance: July 23 - 29  Three-Point Summary  Total DAI supply keeps hitting new highs, now at 5,4B At the same time, USDC is backing almost 61% of DAI System Surplus is now 49,2MM DAI and steadily rising   Announcements:  The next Meet Your Delegate call is scheduled for August 4th. Make sure to join and find out more about future delegates\u2019 platforms. This week, it\u2019s Tim Black\u2019s and PlanetX\u2019s turn. The Risk Core Unit has published an extensive analysis on Maker Vault Activity Metrics with useful insights for risk analysis, business development, and growth.   Discussions   Delegate Platforms  Delegate platform forum threads have now been submitted by @monet-supply, Tim Black (@twblack88), Chris Cameron (@PaperImperium), @ElProgreso, and Planet_X.    Pre-MIP discussion  RWA Foundations - @SebVentures is looking for feedback on an upcoming MIP regarding RWA\u2019s Foundation Structure.    Marketing for MakerDAO   @Kathleen continues with the discussion on MakerDAO\u2019s marketing goals.     Seeking Consensus   [Signal Request] Adjust UNIV2DAIUSDC-A DC-IAM-line   @ultraschuppi is looking for consensus around raising the Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) parameter for the UNIV2DAIUSDC-A Vault.     Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 08:15 Contract Work:  The DssVest audit from ABDK returned. We had some stylistic changes, which we discussed and implemented. Formal verification is continuing to happen on that contract. It should be completed by next week. Just a reminder that the DssVest is not only how we may end up vesting MKR allocations to people but is actually the primary mechanism by which we\u2019re hoping to compensate teams. Rather than passing an executive every month, we can do it once and modify it in this contract. Now, for a bit of disappointing news, the Sushi LP tokens, which I\u2019m sure some people paid attention to FCC\u2019s announcements around Sushi, are deploying a new AMM in one or two months. This introduces a bunch of custom changes for their LP tokens. It\u2019s no longer the standard Uniswap V2  style token. As a result, there\u2019s a lot of unknowns there. It\u2019s not a complete loss; we were able to audit CropJoin, which is the basis of adding these types of tokens. This allows us to potentially move into the onboarding Compound without having to audit the entire thing. Also, we began working on the integrations for keepers to service these LP tokens, and part of that, by transitivity, adds Sushi collateral into the keeper code. We\u2019re going to keep that development path open so that at least the demo keepers that serviced our options will have the ability to also do Sushi auctions. Aside from that, we\u2019re going to need to wait until after their upgrade and reassess this. Many of our team are a little bit disappointed and are thinking about the correct path for integrations. In general, it\u2019s much better if we can get integration partners to come to us, read our documentation, and write their integrations. We\u2019ve had a lot of success with that. This was us attempting to do the integration for a partner, and in a way, we kind of got rugged by it. Obviously, there\u2019s a better path for us to follow in the future. There\u2019s a further development on the managed GemJoin adapter. These are the permission and permissionless Vaults, but more like conditional Vaults. We\u2019re doing some updates and reviews on that. For the next week\u2019s executive, we\u2019ve got a bunch of house cleaning tasks. We need to update some of the RWA descriptors in the ILK registry because they\u2019re not conformant with our other tokens. We also want to test a relay message that sends authorization and denial over to Optimism by command and control structure for Governance to send a message over to Optimism and make changes there. That\u2019ll actually be cool to do. We may want to add this vote delegate factory for delegation into the changelog, so we\u2019ll have to do that in that spell as well.  Infrastructure:  We began playing with the Goerli testnet. A bunch of the team has local nodes running. We\u2019re hoping to get the TechOps group to operate an archive node for Goerli, which will probably help FTX since it is a tool that we use in development. We\u2019re hoping to have that available to us if we\u2019re going to move over to Goerli. We also began deploying to Goerli; There have been a couple of hiccups, but we have at least one test deployment that made it all the way through. Finally, we are currently waiting for some general changelog updates.  Documentation:  We\u2019ve got a cool thing that one of the team members worked on for EDM bytecode programming, which is like writing an ERC20 implementation in the bytecode directly. It really helps us in some ways, such as if we need a particular extremely fast path set of code that will be cheap on gas to save us money. This will be a pretty cool skill set to have. We have a pending forum post for the spell postmortem. We had a session before this to discuss it. Also, I\u2019m sure some of you guys have seen a forum post for the L2 risk framework.  Layer 2:  We\u2019re accelerating the Optimism Fast Withdrawal Bridge design and discussion. We\u2019ve had a couple of sessions this week and converging on exactly how we manage it. We\u2019ll be discussing this with Oracle soon regarding the plan, but we have a pretty good architecture there. There\u2019s also some ongoing work with the Arbitrum bridge. There\u2019s work happening with Starkware to see whether we can get them to create a new independent Core Unit to try and bootstrap a Core Unit that will do all of this but on Starkware.  Meetings and Discussions:  Nexo and Institutional Vaults are just finalizing parameters. There\u2019ll be a post this week. Regarding Lido and stETH, we sat down with their team and discussed the Oracle design and other integration problems. I\u2019ll give the high-level details of onboarding stETH. Between Oracles and Protocol Engineering, there were several sticking points where the design looked pretty risky and wasn\u2019t great. It turns out they\u2019re actively addressing some of the issues we had, and their team also alleviated some of our concerns about other aspects. Right now, the plan is to go forward with integrating them but with lower DCs and then to set a higher debt ceiling when this particular problem is resolved or when this particular risk is resolved. I think that\u2019s at a high level where we ended up with them.   Questions and Comments  Derek: Chris, I\u2019ll just jump in with regards to the Starkwear idea here. That\u2019s kind of been around for the last couple of weeks, and we really solidified it last week when we met the team. We met most of the team in Paris and had a really good sit down and a discussion. We walked through our L2 framework, we referenced the risk framework that we published late last week, we spoke about the multi-chain strategy and discussed this idea of how can we have parallel teams, how to build quicker and not only work on Optimism and Arbitrum with the optimistic roll-ups but also the ZK roll-ups that Starkware: hand and Cairo are operating on. We had a really good meeting with them. I will work with them to help them be familiar with the Maker ecosystem a little more. They will be a completely independent team. Therefore my role is to help them get up and running and understand how we work as a community. Then from that point onwards, as a team, we\u2019ll help them with questions and things, but the idea is to have an independent team doing that work. Hopefully, we can present to you guys soon what their proposal will be. The focus of that will be the L2 Starkware opportunity. They also mentioned this at EthCC; they\u2019re really keen to start doing this and kind of taking ownership and building with Maker. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing that evolve. Hopefully, more news will come on that soon, but I will probably be leaving it to those guys as the face of that work, but I\u2019ll help them get rolling in the background.  Chris: Note the style of this arrangement is the opposite of how we made the Sushi arrangement. They\u2019ll integrate with us rather than us trying to integrate with them.   LongForWisdom: I have a question regarding Optimism and Arbitrum. I know they use the same technology, so I\u2019m kind of curious how sort of plug and play is; for example, the DAI Fast Withdrawal Bridge is between Optimism and Arbitrum. Is it that once it\u2019s ready to go on one, it\u2019s ready to go on the other, or is it more complicated than that?  Chris: There are lots of elements that will be the same. For example, our special kind of vault would produce this DAI for fast withdrawals, but there will be some L2 or domain-specific bits. Obviously, we want you to know structure the code in a way where we can reuse as many things as possible. However, the APIs for different draw-ups are different. They\u2019re kind of similar in the sense that all of them allow you for generic message passing, but they\u2019re different. Chris: Fast Withdraw Optimism is going to be the focus first. It\u2019s already complete.     Risk Team Update  Payton Rose 21:16  We\u2019re currently mostly focusing on the research and analysis of vault user behavior. @josolnik posted the Maker Vault Activity Metrics, which are more growth-based statistics. It can show the retention for users and how many users interact with Maker Vaults every month and etc. the next step is to produce a more risk-focused analysis which means we\u2019ll try to combine these statistics with the type of operations of vault users. We\u2019ll look at each user and analyze how well they\u2019re protecting their vault and if they use any protection services such as DeFiSaver and so on. This should help us better understand the risk of Maker\u2019s debt exposure for each collateral asset. It should also give us better insight into how users react to certain rate changes. This might require a bit more advanced statistical analyzers, but we try to address that as well. We have also finalized some simulations for lower LRs for Maker Vaults. The results currently suggest that we might lower LRs on good quality, lower-tier collaterals that currently have a 175% liquidation ratio. A bit of caution is advised here because at this compensation, due to the low rate, this spread between risk premium and various compensation from fees will only increase if we lower the LR. Luckily, we now have a much higher ratio of surplus buffer to volatile assets, and they should partially help offset these risks. We\u2019ll publish this analysis and write about these concerns in more detail. Other than that, there\u2019s a lot of ongoing work to automize all of these Vault user insights that we found, which we plan to address and put on our risk dashboard. We are also preparing a special kind of dashboard that will monitor dynamics and risks related to the Aave DAI market because we\u2019ll need that once we integrate D3M. Finally, on the collateral evaluation side, @monet-supply will publish the G-UNIv3-DAIUSDC risk assessment. We\u2019re currently going through the list of all the greenlight collaterals to suggest to other teams, along with which collateral could be evaluated next based on their DAI supply potential.   Real-World Finance Team Update  Payton Rose 25:31   @SebVentures was unable to make the call today. He had a couple of things he asked me to highlight; The Centrifuge vaults are up on the current executive. Also, they put up a pre-MIP discussion on the RWA Foundations regarding the Cayman Islands structure that using for future onboarding.   Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 26:24 Growth CU weekly update  We are talking with Paxos. Next week, they will be posting in the Forum the agreement we are arranging with them. Of course, they are excited about being included in the PSM. As I mentioned the other day, part of this agreement will not just add them to the PSM. Still, also, they will be adding DAI into their platform, which means that DAI will have access to all the APIs and the facilities that the Paxos platform provides. DAI will have access to the on/off ramps of Paxos. This is great because if a wallet or any centralized exchange or service wants to connect with our nano prompt solution, they usually have to go to Circle. They are the only platform that provides that service. And that means the platform will be using USDC. However, through this integration with Paxos, they could use DAI. This is great for Maker and the Growth team because we will use this new feature of DAI to initiate a discussion with different platforms to include DAI with these on/off ramps solutions. Stars of the week: DAI has been activated in Binance pay. With Binance Pay, you can shop with DAI or send money to friends and family worldwide. Binance will merge Binance pay with Binance P2P in mid-August, adding a flexible on-off ramp to the platform. Binance pay currently has 2 million users. Binance P2P is the most used on/off-ramp in different emerging markets within Latin America and Southeast Asia. It will be awesome to also have a solution, not just the on/off ramp, but also to pay for services, merchants and send money to everyone worldwide. Dai was part of the first NFT collection by Damien Hirst called \u201cThe Currency,\u201d a collection of 10,000 NFTs that correspond to 10,000 unique physical artworks. Launched on the Palm network, a new Ethereum side chain that supports DAI. Jen from our team, who knows the most about art and NFTs, also talks with different artists to promote DAI as a currency between them. Also, there\u2019s this project called SuperFluid that I would like to invite the Core Units to check out this project. It\u2019s a way that you can stream real-time payments using DAI. It will be a good tool for us in the Core Units to start streaming payments to our contributors. Maybe we could arrange a call for the community to understand how SuperFluid works with DAI.  Tweet of the week. I invite everyone to follow us on Twitter. There are a lot of very good threads that explain what\u2019s happening inside Maker. Last week, we spoke about the delegates.   Questions and Comments  PaperImperium: I was wondering how we were involved in that art project. I\u2019ve seen one earlier, but it\u2019s not really important enough to discuss on this call.  Nadia: Well, those detail will be with Jen. I don\u2019t know if Jen is on the call. If not, I will ask her to include her comments in the Forum. Jen: Yes. This collection was launched through a platform called Palm.io, and they\u2019re a newer sidechain. They have an NFT studio. They have this sidechain technology that supports DAI. Then they also have a team that is essentially working with big brands and well-known artists like Damien Hirst to launch the NFT collection. The great thing is DAI is one of the three tokens that are currently supported along with Bitcoin. We are the only stablecoin right now. As long as the artists and campaigns that choose to launch with Palm want to include DAI, we\u2019ll have a lot of exposure to this kind of high-profile upcoming campaign, which is pretty cool.   Nadia: This happened just a few minutes ago; Derek posted the institutional and long-term vaults in the Forum. We want to see all your comments because we want your feedback. We have been working with the Protocol Engineering and Risk team. Please check it at the Forum and tell us what you think about this type of vault.   Oracles Team Update  Marc-Andre 33:42  Nik is out on vacation this week. We\u2019re working on the Oracle Core Unit formation. The team is still working from the Foundation but will be leaving on August 30th. We will then be officially under the CU umbrella. We completed the deployment of our second transport layer called spire, which is based on LibP2P. The feeds can provide signed price messages to relayers using two independent transport layers, which gives us much more security. We will have another transport layer that will relay prices to the Oracles in an attack or bug. This is a huge achievement. Almost all the layers and the majority of the fees are now running on this. We deployed the smart contracts mainnet for the MATIC token. We will begin deploying the code to feeds and relayers within the next few days and then organize the onboarding of the MATIC collateral token. In addition, we will be making minor adjustments to data models. We are using UniV2 prices for some tokens and will be switching over to UniV3 due to the higher liquidity on v3.   Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Update  Lenka 38:32  Juan: We have a new format this week. I asked for feedback from the other Core Units. People said that they found the updates relatively boring. I was a bit bored myself, so we decided to try this new format. Lenka is going to be showcasing a bit of what happened in EthCC. Lenka, give it away!   1352\u00d7760 122 KB   Lenka: Apologies for the aesthetics. We agreed with Juan that this is something we need to work on, but I put quick slides for you just to zoom in on why we\u2019re talking about Paris by presenting to you the achievements and significance of that event.   1360\u00d7766 125 KB   In terms of the SES Core Unit, we had Juan, myself, and Layer2 presenting. Think of this as a big community reunion or a first-time meeting in real life for the Maker community after a long break due to the pandemic. That is the significance for the Maker community in general. We had our first trial of organizing an event as a DAO. It\u2019s been hectic, but it\u2019s also been really lovely and fun. Equally, one of the greatest achievements was sharing the story of MakerDAO decentralization and updates from the community. there has been quite a challenge from the foundation side to communicate everything that\u2019s happening and at the root of Maker. Equally important is to raise awareness of Core Units as a concept in the community and among everyone who attended these events. In particular, for us, it was important to share what SES is about. We also felt that sharing about SES will help indirectly share about other Core Units and how we\u2019re helping more Core Units to join the ecosystem. We also had many opportunities to connect with other projects trying to form a DAO. For instance, after Nadia\u2019s talk at EthCC, she gave us a shout out and then I had an operations person from Shapeshift reaching out and discussing different challenges because they\u2019re exactly in that situation as us. I\u2019m also the project lead for X-Ray, a research project on talent onboarding and retention. I have been there with a mission to source people to do surveys and interviews for our study. Lastly, I\u2019m also trying to hire someone for our permanent team. We\u2019re looking for a data analyst, and I have a couple of leads with really good context. If anyone is interested, please reach out to us.   1358\u00d7766 107 KB   1360\u00d7762 91.3 KB   1362\u00d7764 137 KB   1368\u00d7754 72.8 KB   On the last day, on Friday, we joined the DAOist with Juan, and I presented a short talk telling my story on how I joined the Foundation and then how I joined the DAO. It was meant to highlight the decentralization path, point out stories about the DAO, and share some lessons learned and the difficulties.   1364\u00d7756 122 KB   We had a big success when it came to being present everywhere. We have pushed the SES and Core Unit narrative into the conversations and took some stages. It\u2019s been really good.   1362\u00d7760 148 KB   1350\u00d7752 98.5 KB   MIPs Update  David Utrobin and Payton Rose 46:54 MIPs Update #46  1985\u00d71107 137 KB   1248\u00d7763 101 KB   1725\u00d7955 171 KB   1728\u00d7963 126 KB   1727\u00d7960 197 KB   1728\u00d7945 134 KB   1725\u00d7960 209 KB   1727\u00d7948 173 KB   1727\u00d7968 172 KB   1723\u00d7965 84.7 KB   1728\u00d7960 159 KB   1728\u00d7960 99.6 KB   1725\u00d7955 184 KB   1725\u00d7960 169 KB   1728\u00d7962 106 KB   1730\u00d7963 120 KB   1730\u00d7960 119 KB   Presentations and Other Discussions  Open Discussion  RWA prices, Oracles, and Liquidation Events 58:53  Justin: I was just wondering if we could walk through an example of the RWAs dropping in value, what the Oracle process would be there, and then actually kicking off a liquidation event. What needs to happen, and how would that would play out?  Payton Rose: Using different Oracles and a different setup from our crypto native vaults. Christopher Mooney: Yes, does it. We\u2019ll see if that is justified at all. Regarding the price change, the prices on-chain are more reflecting the amount that we have loaned out. They\u2019re not reflecting the amount of the asset. The hope is that the RWA facilitator of that team is somehow introspecting the actual solvency of these projects from time to time. They signaled to Governance that we either need to limit the DC or that we need to trigger a liquidation event. There\u2019s a little bit of hand waving there on my part because I\u2019m not entirely sure; it\u2019s not really in the smart contracts domain regarding how that price update happens. Seth is out today. He can explain how that audit of the external assets happens. If anybody has something to fill in there, I\u2019m happy to let you speak up right now. Otherwise, I can then sort of talk generally about what happens on-chain once we do a liquidation. Someone: I can talk a little bit about it. The general idea is that our RWF Core Unit is monitoring these every month. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s different for different issuers. They are presumably looking through their financials and checking up on certain metrics. I think they\u2019re generally provided to us by the issuer. I don\u2019t know how often we go through the somewhat arduous task of auditing them ourselves. If they see that something\u2019s wrong, presumably, we will talk about it in the Forum. It would require a Governance vote to either change the DC or, in a worst-case scenario, to issue a liquidation order. Christopher Mooney: I\u2019m probably going to do a walkthrough of this for the PE team. I may end up publishing the walkthrough so that we could point you right at a video to describe it. The first big distinction is that there are two major RWA types right now. There\u2019s the 6S RWA and the Centrifuge RWA. In 6S\u2019 case, they were originally the reason we developed MIP21, which has several facilities to sort of liquidate or remediate a liquidation and then write off a liquidation. If 6S becomes insolvent or that there was a problem, they couldn\u2019t repay debt. If we didn\u2019t adjust the DC down to prevent them from taking more debt and instead decided that we actually needed to liquidate, we would call this tau function, which puts them into a liquidation period. During that time, they\u2019re still technically what the contract calls \u2018good,\u2019 and there\u2019s a trusted company in the Real World that\u2019s checking the on-chain status of whether or not they\u2019re in good standing. Christopher Mooney: The trust company, in a way, behaves like a smart contract in the Real World. It has a certain set of guidelines it\u2019s supposed to follow to the letter of the law. If they see this go into a bad state, 6S would have some time to remediate this and get some DAI back or something to get themselves back into good working order. If that didn\u2019t happen, this function would return false. There\u2019s a Delaware Trust Company that would end up liquidating all of the lending company\u2019s assets and at some point returning those assets through the same facility that they currently have. We then pay down as much of the loan as we could until Maker knew that there was nothing left, at which point Governance would end up calling the callee function, which is basically a write-off. It means anything that we didn\u2019t get back gets accrued to bad debt. That eats the surplus buffer until we\u2019re out of it and results in the flop options or debt options to recapitalize the Protocol. That\u2019s the MIP21 case. Christopher Mooney: In the Centrifuge case, they have their own on-chain liquidation. They don\u2019t have that trust company that\u2019s doing the liquidation. It\u2019s all the same MIP21 adapter. We do the same exact thing; We figure out that they\u2019re insolvent. We call this tau function, which then activates the ability for the Centrifuge manager to take over and begin to call in the loan from DROP token holders. If there\u2019s anyone from Centrifuge on the call, feel free to elaborate on that because, beyond that scope, the Protocol Engineering team is treating it the same as MIP21. We basically cross our fingers and hope that they\u2019re going to liquidate appropriately.   Lucas: I will try to jump in if you want me to.  Christopher Mooney: Yes, that\u2019d be great. Let\u2019s say we\u2019ve just triggered a tau, and now we\u2019re redeeming against Centrifuge. What happens in that case? Lucas: Our contracts have something in the system contracts that are called redemptions. Basically, an external investor, in this case, its Maker, wants to get their money out of the pool. We trigger this redemption on the smart contract, which then reserves all of the cash flows coming in from loan repayments. Like in NewSilver\u2019s instance, this would be a repayment coming in from a loan that they have given out to a home or a real estate investor who bought a home and takes that payment to give it back to any investor who wants it redemptions. Lucas: The other place where money could come from to redeem these Makers\u2019 DROP tokens is other investors who want to join this pool and invest money. At this point, what the pool will do is prioritize Maker to redeem their investments. On the legal side, smart contracts are risky, protected by a legal SPV that has a claim over individual loans. Lucas: Centrifuge\u2019s assets work in the way that they\u2019re pools of different assets and loans. In NewSilver\u2019s case, it would be, right now, around 40 different properties in the U.S. those will be repaid, and Maker would see DAI coming in from that. That\u2019s the high-level discussion. I can also point to the MIP22 that describes the legal and technical aspects of how this liquidation works in more detail. Christopher Mooney: For that MIP22 discussion, we decided to start auditing it. It was a lot of code, so they already had a 120 person hour audit on it. The DappHub guys, who are the team that originally wrote the Maker Protocol, at least the early versions of it, are completing the second audit. Christopher Mooney: People are looking at that codebase beyond our Protocol Engineering team to ensure it\u2019s up to par and free of bugs and exploits. That liquidation mechanism, we didn\u2019t plug directly into the Protocol right away because we couldn\u2019t do that ourselves. In this case, let\u2019s say we were able to sort of recapitalize enough of one of the Centrifuge assets or loans. We would simply call the I think the cure function, which is a way to say this has been remediated. If we can\u2019t, then it\u2019s the same thing in the adapters; We end up calling callee, which accrues to bad debt. Bad debt goes to the surplus buffer. The surplus buffer goes down below zero. Then we have to hold debt auctions to recapitalize the system. It\u2019s the same flow from that point forward. I know that was a lot.   Someone: I\u2019m just curious how a debt auction in Maker works with a Real World Asset if these loans become delinquent. We have to write it off, and we then have to recapitalize the Protocol.  Christopher Mooney: Yes. It\u2019s Maker holders that recapitalize the Protocol, which means Maker holders get diluted in that case. This is a natural incentive that MKR holders have because they don\u2019t want to get diluted. They want to ensure they do their due diligence whenever setting up these RWAs and ensuring that they\u2019re less likely to experience that. Aside from that, we\u2019ve written the debt-off mechanism that is the same for any collateral in the system. It follows the same liquidation flow that the debt auctions occur, and it\u2019s exactly what happened a week after Black Thursday. That exact flow is exactly what\u2019s going to happen.   LongForWisdom: It\u2019s worth noting that one mechanism, whether that mechanism is triggered, is a system-wide thing rather than a collateral-specific thing. If the system as a whole isn\u2019t open, then it triggers the auctions, right?  Christopher Mooney: That\u2019s right. We resolve whether or not the individual vaults are insolvent first. That\u2019s what either in the MIP21 case for 6S, that\u2019s what the trust company is doing for us. In the MIP22 case with Centrifuge, that\u2019s what their codebase does by trying to resolve the specific vaults liquidity first. If that fails, then MKR holders are the backstop of the entire Protocol. Payton Rose: Much like regular crypto assets, as we mentioned, would get marked bad, and if it\u2019s within the surplus buffer though, we won\u2019t result in the dilution there, but rather than 40 minutes, the legal procedures might take much longer for us to recapitalize. Christopher Mooney: Right, which is why Governance has to call them. There is a sticking design flaw in my head. Keep in mind, this entire adapter is the first version to learn how to do this better. I\u2019m afraid that if we did end up getting there to the point where we needed to write the debt off, that MKR holders are the last party that would be inclined to actually call the write-off function because it\u2019s going to dilute them. Christopher Mooney: There may be a way to make that call permissionless or determine if it\u2019s permissionless, but I haven\u2019t found anything completely satisfactory yet that calls that permissionless that Governance couldn\u2019t then just take positive action to stop it from being called. Governance has a lot of power, so they could probably stop themselves from getting diluted. It\u2019d be nice if that train left the station and Governance actually had to intervene to stop the write-off. Whereas it\u2019s designed today, Governance actually has to vote to do the write-off, which I think is not the right incentive structure. We should fix this problem. LongForWisdom: For what it\u2019s worth, I agree. It should be automatic and then convince us to take positive action to stop it. Christopher Mooney: Right. Kurt brings up a good point; Governance doesn\u2019t call that function to get diluted. They\u2019re basically putting the losses on DAI holders. That will cause a lack of confidence in DAI holders. In a long-term view, Maker holders are still incentivized to call that function correctly. It would just be better if they didn\u2019t actually have to vote for it. Lucas: You think that if you have confidence in DAI collapses, then there\u2019s the confidence that MKR token collapses shortly after that. It\u2019s still clearly long-term value destructive for MKR holders to not call that function. I agree it would be better if it didn\u2019t rely on them taking action. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate to say that they don\u2019t have an incentive to keep the protocol solvent.   Someone: I do want to caution that perhaps being automatic might be overkill just because, ultimately, what matters is the solvency and not the liquidity of Maker to meet its ongoing obligations and ensure that DAI is adequately backed system-wide. We could probably imagine scenarios with a negative surplus buffer but would not necessarily require triggering dilution. Just more complex stuff to think about.  Christopher Mooney: For historical context, there\u2019s a slight discussion in the sidebar. After Black Thursday, I think the SinQ time was around two days or something, which was going to be, I think, maybe in the middle of the night on the weekend. We didn\u2019t think it was going to be a great time to recapitalize the Protocol. MKR holders did step in, and there was an executive to extend the exact point at which the dilution would happen at East Coast office hours or something like that. There was time to drum up support for purchasing these MKR in a flop auction. MKR holders have actively intervened to extend the exact moment when the write-off happens, which is the equivalent of leaving this thing for permission for only Governance to call it. Lucas: As long as the delay on enacting a Governance action is shorter than whatever the time it would take for that debt to go from being marked as bad debt to actually debt auction starting, orders have various route powers over the system. I won\u2019t get into the exact technical details. Still, they could revoke authorizations or replace contracts and completely change the rules of the system to ensure that whatever debt auctions don\u2019t happen at all, even if they came from normal collateral auctions that were permissionless liquidated and then not properly recapitalized. In other words, they always have the power to stop there, right now, anyway. In the future, you can build out layers of authorization protection on the system to completely prevent that. The flip side of that is then you can\u2019t change it if there\u2019s a bug. That\u2019ll be an evolving discussion throughout the Protocol\u2019s lifetime. at what point do you switch certain things to be unmodifiable versus leaving the modifiable so that you have maybe slightly fewer security guarantees against MKR holders misbehaving, but you can fix bugs? LongForWisdom: I agree. In general, it\u2019s what Chris says. It\u2019s silly for Maker holders to not do that. It depends a little bit on magnitudes. I can imagine a situation where the end of capitalization is super small. We just thought, well, you know what, they\u2019ll recapitalize it in like a few weeks, and then we just don\u2019t do it. Likewise, if it was massive, I can see people wanting to press the button. I can see some weird cases where people maybe would not want to, but yeah. Lucas: It is far enough that it might be covered by a surplus buffer, or if it\u2019s really that small and maybe you do the math, and it\u2019s like, oh, this is four weeks of stability fees or something. Payton Rose: Yeah, pushing the button is a one-way operation. You would need to deploy new collateral if you wanted to recover from them.

All the updates from MakerDAO Governance and Risk Call #157 in this snippet.  Governance  The executive proposal from two weeks ago has passed. Both polls to Lower the Flash Mint Fee to 0% and Add RWA007 (SolarX) as a new RWA Vault Type has passed. Three community greenlight polls have closed. Two of them were greenlit, and one deferred. A bunch of interesting things going into next week\u2019s executive.   Forum at a Glance Forum at a Glance: August 27 - Sept 2  Team Updates  GovAlpha GovAlpha Weekly Update  Onboarding has been going particularly well this past week. Got a new member, @TheExistence, who started doing some work for us, so say hello if you see him on the forums or RocketChat.  @LongForWisdom is exploring how Core Units can better understand Project Priority from voters/the community at large.   Protocol Engineering  Layer 2:  Arbitrum\u2019s Layer 2 launched. We\u2019re running a final audit and should have the DAI Gateway launched within a few weeks. Reason: it\u2019s a custom gateway that allows us to have fungible DAI. Met with Optimism Team. They are planning an upgrade in October, making deployments feel very much like L1. Keeping regular Sync with Proposed StarkNet Team. Check out their Pod session this week; I also had Bartek give a good discussion on some of the potential relations with the PE team. Synch with Oracles to discuss opportunities for sending messages over to L2. Message passing infrastructure - requirements documentation.   Wrapped up several FV tasks - using Certora:  L2 DAI - writing specs, the inclusion of the permit function. DssVest - FV and fuzzing (automated software testing technique).   Other work this week:  Adding MATIC support to the auction keeper. Goerli Deployment work - All complete except for Centrifuge RWAs (sharing goETH). GUNI - we completed the internal team audit and have ABDK doing an audit later this month.   Ongoing Audits:  B.Protocol auditing DssCharter to support institutional vaults.     Oracles  Continuing development for stETH, which should be complete within the next few weeks. Thinking about long-term roadmap planning; looking at bridge alignment and overlap of needs for products and services.  Want to develop the Fast Withdrawal Bridge for Optimism first before applying it to other areas. Want to create a standardized interface for cross-chain communication. This is all still early and under initial research for ideas.   Hired a design firm to generate logos, typography, and more. Discussed with TechOps to continue infrastructure monitoring for us. Entity formation underway; will complete setup within the next two weeks.  Making progress on finding a banking partner - may take a few months.     Risk Risk CU Monthly Review  New Dashboards and planned features. KNC-A offboarding parameters posted. Other collateral will follow next with similar steps, or parameter adjustments proposed to offboard them. Still working on the Nexo Institutional Vault risk assessment; in the meantime, waiting for the poll\u2019s outcome to confirm or adjust loan terms.  Evaluation is 80% complete and adding few new sections. Still thinking about auction parameters for this kind of vault and thinking of limiting auction throughout because of the size of the loan and at the same time increasing liquidation penalty. Evaluating DssCharter implementation - might have some risks if the borrower doesn\u2019t know how to use flash loans or doesn\u2019t have external capital available to perform top-ups or repays.   PSM-PAX-A evaluating proper DC IAM parameters, which are currently disabled. We could decrease gap PSM USDC-A and at the same time increase it for PAX - that will lower tail risks of particular stablecoin failure, plus diversification benefits. Looking into stETH/ETH Curve pool as next collateral evaluation.   Growth Growth CU weekly update  Posted a signal request for launching the Nexo Institutional Vault. Nexo posted a financial analysis of these kinds of Vaults. Speaking with institutions who know how to handle and protect their positions. Suggest that we should not offboard Loopring, BAT, and MANA tokens. They are interested in using the Maker Protocol  Loopring and MANA opened positions in Maker Protocol. Discussing with them to continue using these vaults.   Strategy for Maker Growth:  Thinking about how to involve DAI in NFT and Metaverse solutions appearing. Working with various artists and popular gaming tournaments to implement DAI. Continuing strategy with Metaverse working on NFTs.   PAXOS team began using the PSM and are interested in increasing the DC.   Content Production Content Production Bi-weekly Update  New six-month budget will be up within the next few days. Engaging with a lawyer to better understand our communication boundaries. Hosted AMAs with Planet_X and Nadia. Updated Maker Relay videos by replacing Current Events with Forum at a Glance Syndicating Maker Relay updates with Substack. Posted update on brand research that was conducted. Results show that people focus on the value of the community. Feedback on this would be appreciated. Alec has been working on a dashboard that tracks MakerDAO metrics and beginning production on another to help consolidate Dai on Different Networks.   Governance Communications GovComms Bi-weekly Update  We received Dai, setup with AccountAble in progress. Our accounting actuals will begin getting posted starting the first week of October. Summary Team now has coverage of every public call except CU Tools & CU Rituals. Hunt for an Engagement Lead continues. We started an internal people list, with a public version of this resource planned for the future. We cleaned up the old Emergency Communications Process document and formulated a plan for this document. The plan is to make this into an all-encompassing Emergency Playbook that contains information on Emergency types, MakerDAO\u2019s threat monitoring practices, the various coordination tracks(and associated processes.) What began as a Team update audit has expanded into a general \u201cinformation output\u201d audit. We are continuing work on this, expecting to have a complete set of information by the end of the month. Forum at a Glance now has a project overview document. You can also find the FaaG presentation that Artem does on Youtube, thanks to Content Production! The Monthly Governance Review now also has a project overview document  Our office hours are set to Fridays 1800-1830 UTC and are available on the public calendar.   Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling SES Public Drive  Project X-Ray:  Presentation of Preliminary Findings by @lenka & @jordanj found in the SES Public Drive Help wanted with Qualitative Research by filling out this form.

Real-World Finance RWF Monthly Core Unit Report  SolarX was approved by Governance.  Working on setting up the Cayman Foundation and the deal documentation.   On-chain securitization roadmap:  Had our first call between Shearman & Sterling and Manatt.   Growing the team:  New full-time recruit should join us next week. Keeping the Core Unit small; less than 7 FTE. RWA reporting will be done by William from now on.     MIPs MIPs Update #51  We had a gap week, which means there were no events planned for the week. Formal Submission Window for eligible proposals for September opens on Monday 6th.\u200b  ",

My name is LongForWisdom. I am one of the Governance Facilitators at MakerDAO. We like people to get involved and ask questions or comments, so please, do not be shy if you have something to say.   Weekly Updates  Governance  LongForWisdom 01:09  The executive proposal from two weeks ago has passed.  Both polls to Lower the Flash Mint Fee to 0% and Add RWA007 (SolarX) as a new RWA Vault Type has passed. The executive also increased 6S Capital\u2019s DC, decreased the LRs on several vaults, and increased the PSM USDCA fee-in. Finally, it onboarded MATIC and PAX PSM.   Three community greenlight polls have closed. Two were greenlit (Nebula Capital Partners DROP and Cauris Global Fintech Fund DROP), and one deferred (CapitalNow Cannabis DROP). A bunch of interesting things going into next week\u2019s executive.   Forum at a Glance  Artem Gordon 03:24 Forum at a Glance for August 27 - September 2  Now in video format!  Forum at a Glance Video     GovAlpha Core Unit update 10:15 GovAlpha Weekly Update  Onboarding has been going particularly well this past week. Got a new member, @TheExistence, who started doing some work for us, so say hello if you see him on the forums or RocketChat.  @LongForWisdom is exploring how Core Units can better understand Project Priority from voters/the community at large.   Questions  Q: Regarding gas prices going through the roof this week because of NFT minting, do you think it is a good idea to have delegates have a minimum that they have retained in their voting contract of ETH, right? Should we have a certain limit, like a floor? Is that something you guys have been thinking about? If you have such a requirement because there are shadow delegates and recognized delegates, but it is also free. I wonder how you guys are thinking about that.  A: I am not quite sure I understood; you said have a floor of ETH?   Someone: yes, this does not always happen - Black Swan events possibly do not occur every year but imagine we have another one, and we need to do an emergency vote. Do you think delegates should retain at least one or ten ETH if they have to pay 2500 in gas fee in gwei?  Q: You say that delegates should hold it if the gas prices are high, but we need to pass something significant quickly. I can say it is not something I have thought about to this point. Perhaps the delegate should consider doing that, but I do not think that would be hard to mandate, especially when the price of each increase comes to be pretty punitive. I would encourage delegates to know they have enough fees to pay gas prices even in high congestion conditions.   A: It is something we hope does not happen every week.   Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney  Derek 14:36  Layer 2:  Arbitrum\u2019s Layer 2 launched. We\u2019re running a final audit and should have the DAI Gateway launched within a few weeks. Reason: it\u2019s a custom gateway that allows us to have fungible DAI. Met with Optimism Team. They are planning an upgrade in October, making deployments feel very much like L1. Keeping regular Sync with Proposed StarkNet Team. Check out their Pod session this week; I also had Bartek give a good discussion on some of the potential relations with the PE team. Synch with Oracles to discuss opportunities for sending messages over to L2. Message passing infrastructure - requirements documentation.   Wrapped up several FV tasks - using Certora:  L2 DAI - writing specs, the inclusion of the permit function. DssVest - FV and fuzzing (automated software testing technique).   Other work this week:  Adding MATIC support to the auction keeper. Goerli Development work - All complete except for Centrifuge RWAs (sharing goETH). GUNI - we completed the internal team audit and have ABDK doing an audit later this month.   Ongoing Audits:  B. Protocol auditing DssCharter to support institutional vaults. We wrapped up several formal verification tasks using Certora. We also wrapped up DSS best, so formal verification fuzzing is using automated software testing techniques.     Questions  Q: regards the evolution of the Protocol Engineering Team and now bringing up audits. The top auditing firms have audited hacks, and they did formal and informal verification by the top Ethereum community members out there. Have you thought about a white hack team to have an extra eye besides reaching out to an informal audit? A: We have, and we have thought about internal teams and maybe other protocol teams like we are doing with B.Protocol. There are ways to split the team and have people look at each other\u2019s code, and it is a great way of sharing knowledge that one group has worked on versus another. Q: There are so many facets of doing this, but just having these sets of tests and sets of integration tests that are running against the thing - the entire time looking for exploits, I like to pay attention to exploits, and when I have had the time you can make a test that mock out those exploits even though they do not work against your code and so you leave them there as a regression to see changes you would allow for that to happen. We have internal code reviews that are adversarial. There are different approaches to doing the sort of defense in depth.   Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 26:10  We are continuing development for stETH, which should be complete within the next few weeks. We are thinking about long-term roadmap planning by looking at bridge alignment on bridges. We saw that there is an overlap of needs for products and services.  We want to develop the Fast Withdrawal Bridge for Optimism first before applying it to other areas. We want to create a standardized interface for cross-chain communication. Please understand that this is all still early and under initial research for ideas.   We hired a design firm to generate logos, typography, and more. We discussed with TechOps to continue infrastructure monitoring for us. The entity formation is underway; we will complete the setup within the next two weeks.  We\u2019re making progress on finding a banking partner - it may take a few months.     Questions  Q: Is the idea to partner up with a high-frequency trading desk and get that data fed into these L2 down the road?  A: Are you talking about monetizing data sets, or why particularly high fidelity?   Q: Oracle as a service like you see PIF, which I asked you about before by monetizing through Jane Street or Jump Trading, one of those two. Is there anything Maker can do with L2s to scale to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second?  A: You can negotiate with any data provider. It will take a while for that ecosystem to build out.     Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 36:33 Risk CU Monthly Review  We now have new Dashboards and planned features. KNC-A offboarding parameters are posted on Forum. Other unprofitable collateral will follow with similar steps, or parameter adjustments proposed to offboard them. We\u2019re still working on the Nexo Institutional Vault risk assessment; in the meantime, waiting for the poll\u2019s outcome to confirm or adjust loan terms. The risk assessment is proceeding well:  Evaluation is 80% complete and adding few new sections. Still thinking about auction parameters for this kind of vault and thinking of limiting auction throughout because of the size of the loan and at the same time increasing liquidation penalty. Evaluating DssCharter implementation might have some risks if the borrower does not know how to use flash loans or has no external capital available to perform top-ups or repay the debt.   We worked on PSM-PAX-A by evaluating proper DC IAM parameters, which are currently disabled. We could decrease gap PSM USDC-A and at the same time increase it for PAX - that will lower tail risks of particular stablecoin failure, plus diversification benefits. We are looking into stETH/ETH Curve pool as the next collateral evaluation. We are working on the risk dashboard, which was redesigned with a new UI and a few additional features already implemented, like gas monitor, which shows the life estimation of gas cost a world user might do, and working on features that will be added. More information can be found in the dashboard in our monthly review posted by Primoz.   Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 40:18 Growth CU Weekly Updates  Posted a signal request for launching the Nexo Institutional Vault. Our suggestion to the community: we should launch the Institutional Vault because it\u2019s a product that we can reach out to other companies with. This is a more capital-efficient solution and will bring Maker to a minimum of 200 million DAI from crypto collaterals like Ethereum and Bitcoin. Nexo posted a financial analysis of these types of Vaults. Nexo Institutional Vault - This is a different solution than long-term or fixed-term vaults that you\u2019ve seen with solutions like Deco. Institutions are looking for larger positions; talks are in place with institutions that know how to handle their positions and engage in protection from liquidation. We suggest that we should not offboard Loopring token, BAT token, and MANA token because these projects are interested in using the Maker Protocol.  Loopring and MANA have already opened a position with the Maker Protocol. Working on strategies so that their communities can use these vaults.   Strategy for Maker Growth:  Thinking about how to involve DAI in NFT and Metaverse solutions appearing. Working with various artists and popular gaming tournaments to implement DAI. Continuing strategy with Metaverse working on NFTs. Gala Games added DAI to purchase currency on their website.   PAXOS team began using the PSM and are interested in increasing the DC.   Questions  Q: The MATIC Vault hasn\u2019t been used it. Was the team waiting for the debt ceiling to be raised? A: They will be using it in the following days. They wrote in the forums that the vault would open shortly. It is not a high priority at this moment; it will take a few days.   Content Production Update  Seth Goldfarb 48:00 Content Production Biweekly Updates  New six-month budget will be posted in a few days.  Three-month budget is a tight budget that does not allow for enough planning, hence the switch to a six-month budget.   We are engaging with a lawyer to understand our communication boundaries better. We hosted AMAs with Planet_X and Nadia. AMA with Centrifuge is coming up. We updated Maker Relay videos by replacing Current Events with Forum at a Glance We are syndicating Maker Relay updates with Substack. We posted an update on brand research that was conducted. Results show that people focus on the value of the community. Feedback on this would be appreciated. Alec has been working on a dashboard that tracks MakerDAO metrics and beginning production on another to help consolidate Dai on Different Networks. We are making progress on Explainer Videos, MakerDao.com community portal, asset allocation in the works to coordinate with DAI foundation.   Governance Communications Update  David Utrobin 53:14 GovComms Bi-weekly Update  We received Dai, setup with AccountAble is in progress. Our accounting actuals will begin getting posted starting the first week of October. Summary Team now has coverage of every public call except CU Tools & CU Rituals. We are on the hunt for an Engagement Lead continues. We started an internal people list, with a public version of this resource planned for the future. We cleaned up the old Emergency Communications Process document and formulated a plan for this document. The plan is to make this into an all-encompassing Emergency Playbook that contains information on Emergency types, MakerDAO\u2019s threat monitoring practices, the various coordination tracks(and associated processes.) What began as a Team update audit has expanded into a general \u201cinformation output\u201d audit. We are continuing work on this, expecting to have a complete set of information by the end of the month. Forum at a Glance has a project overview document. You can also find the FaaG presentation that Artem does on Youtube, thanks to Content Production! The Monthly Governance Review now also has a project overview document  Our office hours are set to Fridays 1800-1830 UTC and are available on the public calendar.   Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Update  Juan Guill\u00e9n 59:08 SES Public Drive  Project X-Ray:  Presentation of Preliminary Findings by @lenka & @jordanj found in the SES Public Drive Help wanted with Qualitative Research by filling out this form.

Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 1:04:30 RWF CU Monthly Report  SolarX was approved by Governance.  Working on setting up the Cayman Foundation and the deal documentation.   We are working on our on-chain securitization roadmap:  Had our first call between Shearman & Sterling and Manatt.   We continue to grow the team:  New full-time recruit should join us next week. Keeping the Core Unit small; less than 7 FTE. RWA reporting will be done by William from now on.     MIPs Update  Pablo 1:10:34 Weekly MIPs Update  We had a gap week, which means there were no events planned for the week.

Welcome to everyone. I\u2019m joined by a bunch of excited Maker people. If someone is speaking and you have questions, please don\u2019t be afraid to ask them. We enjoy it when people get involved. Recently, we had topics on the forum more contentious than usual and in the chat and various other places and such. I would like to give everyone a general reminder to keep things civil and try to engage in good faith in these discussions, these meetings, etc. I don\u2019t think we are anywhere near getting to the point where I need to tell anyone that, but I think it serves as a good general reminder. Most people would agree that everyone is on the same side. We are all working towards the same goal, so if someone says something you disagree with, please try and take it in the best way possible or with the best possible intentions. I\u2019ll get into my updates for Governance. Last week\u2019s executive passed and hasn\u2019t been executed yet, but that will see some increases to the DCs and addition to the DC Instant Access Module for a few of the UNI LP tokens, which I know a couple of people have been eagerly awaiting. This isn\u2019t all of them; This is DAI-ETH, USDC-ETH, and DAI-USDC, all of which are seeing increases. We are also ready to increase the ETH-B debt floor, also known as dust, from 2000 to 15000 Dai. And we also increased the surplus lot size from 10000 to 30000. This is the lot size when we do flap options, where we burn auctions off Dai to burn MKR. We had a set of polls this week, all of which have passed. There were four polls for DC increases on PSM-USDC-A, ZRX-A, YFI-A, and COMP-A. YFI-A is particularly timely because we\u2019re now at the DC. This week\u2019s executive will include all of those four poll outcomes. It will also include the first budget distribution for the Core Units, Governance, Risk, and RWF. We will see the first monthly payments to those units, which is exciting. To give a brief update on what Gov Alpha and our Core Unit have been doing, we posted on the MIPs\u2019 portal a couple of times. We\u2019ve had a new update pushed to the main URL. This now includes sub-proposals. You can now view sub-proposals on the MIPs portal. We had other improvements as well. You can now link directly to a section within a MIP. The search functionality is improved. There have been other minor polishes. we\u2019ve provided a 1.2 spec on new features for the next version. Development on that will continue. We\u2019ve had the initiative to clean up the MIPs themselves and add tags to tie them at the MIPs portal. We can use the MIPs portal tags to provide more tailored searches, which may be useful to individual Core Units or people interested in certain things. Onboarding is going fairly well; We are continuing to onboard Prose to operate on many Governance processes such as polls and the executive process. We are continuing to onboard Elihu as well. The MIP3 rewrite is in progress, which we discussed at last week\u2019s Governance meeting. Since then, we have had a separate meeting about it. We agreed that MIP3, the monthly Governance Cycle MIP, could use a bit of rewrite; That\u2019s in progress, and we are hoping to post that early next week on the forum for feedback. Finally, we have been working on parameter documentation for Liquidations 2.0. When the first poll goes out for the LINK-A parameters, which is on Monday, Governance will have easy links that will tell them what parameters mean. This is in progress, but we are getting there. We are hoping to have everything ready for Monday. We may only get 90% of the most important parameters done, but let\u2019s see.  Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum. Weekly Updates Forum at a Glance Peyton Rose 07:21 Forum at a Glance: Mar 26 - Apr 01, 2021 Three Point Summary  Total DAI supply above 3B! The Surplus Buffer will cross 20M DAI for the first time today Weekly VWAP for DAI down to $1.001  ICYMI Announcements   @SebVentures and the Real-World Finance Team published an article on (Crypto) Banking 101.   Catch up on the MKR Compensation conversation and consider joining the newly * announced working group!  Discussions   Core Unit Mandate Overlap   @Planet_X points to overlap within Core Unit mandates, inviting community discussion on the process of decentralization.    Business strategy and evaluation framework for Business-like Core Units   @SebVentures builds on the above thread and invites conversation on how Core Units can be evaluated.    Signal Requests   Petition Letter to A16z  Voting Ends Soon! Following a previous discussion, @iammeeoh is looking to gather consensus around a petition for a16z to get involved in governance.    Real World Finance Team Update Sebastien Derivaux 10:25  First, the financial reports for last month will be done tomorrow. It was slightly too short today to get it done. There were some complications in the SQL query, but everything is fixed. My numbers show that we had less than 3 million last night at midnight, which is different from the numbers we usually use. I will make a post about that. On data infrastructure, I made good progress, or at least I spoke with a lot of people from inside the Foundation and outside of it to see how we can work together to create data infrastructure to source all the data we need. not only for my Core Units but for other Core Units as well. If there is an idea for Data Core Units outside in the wild, please reach out to me. On the collateral side, we will have New Silver quite soon. I will let Chris expand more on that. We will have the final due diligence with them next Tuesday. I have to find a bit of Dai to invest in this pool as I\u2019m one of the core investors in the pool. We will work on a timeline with the SC Team and other moderators to see how we can use more RWAs within the following months. We have a pipeline; We have ConsoleFreight that can be done almost any time. Still, we will wait a little bit to see if things works out with New Silver and, after that, begin to onboard other collaterals. I created an article on Crypto Banking 101. Check it out.\u200b  Smart Contracts Team Update Christopher Mooney 13:51  We\u2019ve not made any significant progress on the collateral onboarding sheet last week, but we assigned Nas to it. He\u2019s going to gut-check each one of those collaterals. We want to begin ranking all the newly added collaterals over the past two months and have an idea of what we\u2019re going to pick up after liquidations 2.0. There were no collateral assessments this week. But there ae updates on collateral for Kovan. We ended up shipping PAX-G to Kovan. PAX-G is relatively more difficult to get into the system due to fee-charging on transfers. Our current way of using the system with UIs would result in double fees. This is similar to Tether. However, they don\u2019t have the fee turned on. This is a generic way to handle any token that does transfer fees. We also have NS2-DRP, which I will detail in a few minutes. We\u2019re dealing with the medians on Kovan and trying to reflect their price updates. This was done through a cross-collaboration process with the Oracle team. Three things are in review: We have a more efficient MegaPoker that we\u2019re looking at and hoping to get that out on to Kovan soon. We have LP Oracle tokens review and the Sushi Join adapter, which is off for auditing. On the MIP22 Centrifuge front, we squeezed that RWA addition into a MIP21 style adapter. It\u2019s still called MIP22 because it handles its own liquidations, but it\u2019s in MIP21 format, making it easy to adapt. We\u2019ve added the first version of the Centrifuge, the New Silver edition; that\u2019s the NS2-DRP token we\u2019ve added to Kovan. MIP21 and MIP22 are officially in Kovan and have been tested in Kovan. We will be able to release YFI based on the shipment of Liquidations 2.0. we\u2019re expecting it up on Kovan by Wednesday. However, there is lots of work, and it may go up by Friday. Some of the work involveddust consistency and comment changes that we merged in the main PR. We reviewed and merged the clippermom, which is the new clipper that will have a publicly accessible circuit breaker on it. We have also reviewed the ESM replacement. Ilk registry is completed but still in review. We also have Dss interface changes that we need to update. There is the actual Kovan spell itself with a giant checklist on it. It\u2019s a huge spell. If you\u2019re interested in auditing, feel free to check it out. We have many changes based on the clarifications of MIP45, including additions of all audits. We\u2019re going to post all the audit reports into MIP45 as well as make clarifications and remove some function parameters in that PR. Let us know if these are too many changes for a MIP. Finally, we have to create a bug bounty for Liquidations 2.0 and update the security docs.  Updates on Optimism L2 SamM  The Optimism team delayed their launch, which gives us more time to audit. We don\u2019t have to rush the contracts. We\u2019ve developed an upgradable v1 bridge that can be replaced to support fast withdrawals in the future. We also developed a Governance repeater, which is a mechanism that allows us to run spells on L2 Optimism. We don\u2019t need to use the multi-sig. We\u2019ve been actively looking into Optimism\u2019s token bridge standard design discussions.  Chris: I would like Derek to speak on the community sections. He was working directly with the SC domain team or the protocol engineering team. Derek: Yesterday, I submitted the SC Core Unit Application, which is now in the formal submission. It\u2019s been renamed into ProtocolEengineering because we\u2019ve expanded the team to include two more individuals, Bartek and Chris, who have been doing a lot of work in L2 Optimism. It\u2019s enabling us to focus on innovation growth on the L2 world a lot more now than previously focused on. In the upcoming week, I will focus on creating team-specific backlogs, priorities and OKRs in advance of the executive vote. I am highlighting this point because we\u2019re committed to working on decentralization strategies and building a structure that enables multiple teams to contribute to the protocol.    Oracle Team Update Nik Kunkel 25:18  There was a light feed proposal from Defi Saver. I have reviewed their proposal, and it all checks out to polling votes on Monday for the DAO to vote on. They are a really good team. They\u2019ve done a lot to bring the Maker ecosystem further along. They\u2019ve provided an alternative interface to Oasis. The automation service they made\u2019s prevented the auction vulnerability that we have. Please, vote your honest opinion. I am the point of contact for ABDK ever since we did a Uniswap LP audit with them. We\u2019re still finishing some of the fixes they brought up in their audits. There are some dependencies on the SC team, who are busy at the moment. We will finalize this as quickly as possible and complete the final audit report. We\u2019ve got an ABDK agreement to do the audit for crop join adapter implementation for Sushi Swap. This is a pared-down version of Compound. It will cost us 8000 DAI, which we are planning to submit by April and expecting a report by May. Then we would have another round of feedback with them. However, if no criticial issues are found, maybe we can deploy the Sushi Swap crop join adapter without the final report being published. We\u2019ve been working on revamping the Oracle Kovan deployment. It used to source its own non-mainnet feeds. This revamping is the kind of effort we\u2019re trying to get into running Liquidations 2.0 on Kovan. This will be helpful for the people that are trying to integrate changes coming with Liquidations 2.0. The migration should be complete today. Regarding Uniswap LP Oracles, we just had the vote to raise DC. The Rates Group is discussing raising DC on more Uniswap LP collateral types. The plan is to lean more towards the ETH derivative, not EWRC20 types. In the past, we raised DAI-USDC, DAI-ETH, and USDC-ETH. Coming up would be ETH-USDT and probably UNI-ETH, and WBTC-ETH could be an interesting option as well. The patched client we\u2019ve been talking about, which fixes the state size issues, is now stable. We\u2019ve got an instance close to 100 GB, which is the target. Previously, the state size was 4.3 GB. We\u2019re looking to launch within the next few weeks.  Operational Support Update Juan 35:23  We now have the new version of the MIPs portal. You will find an improved search sub proposal mode and realizations if you go to mip.makerdao.com. The Gov Alpha team uses it to clean a lot of data and ensure that data is consistent and readable. Know your MIP is going to be next Friday at 1PM. We will publish the agenda. Tim and Seb are going to discuss the EURO-DAI MIP. If you\u2019re interested, please join us. Regarding collateral onboarding, we have Bancor next week on April 7th. It will be followed by SolidBlock on April 14th talking about the RWF; agendas are in the forum. We have seen a lot of updates on Core Units. We are keeping track of everything on them. coreunit.makerdao.network has new images for deadlines. We had a call yesterday with Otonomos explaining how their Otocore works and how to spin LLC directly from a wallet. It was followed by the Maker compensation framework. We will be having a call with @davidutro on April 21st to discuss the Core Unit he proposed, which is Gov Comms, including all the new modifications that he has been doing. The Protocol Engineering Core Unit has been renamed to align more with the mandate. Special emphasis on Maker Compensation working group. After yesterday\u2019s call, we plan to assemble a small group that can put forward proposals for Governance which we can vote on. We\u2019re looking for one current core unit, either facilitator or contributor; We\u2019re looking for a proposed one. We\u2019re also looking for a third party that will be neutral and brings experience to the topic. Then, we\u2019re looking for one large Maker holder and a community member with less of a position. We\u2019re trying to hear all the voices and propose something.

We actually discovered that there can be improvements made on visibility and communication overall for MakerDao and the Maker Protocol.   3840\u00d72160 437 KB   We currently have over 1,000 partners from across the world who are each focused on different solutions.   3840\u00d72160 516 KB   We want our partners to integrate Dai if it makes sense for them to do so. We need to understand the differentials. The Dai savings rate is one of the leading advantages of using the Maker Protocol over other DeFi Protocols, stablecoins, and banks. However, partners are waiting until we have more RWAs in the Protocol before continuing with us.   3840\u00d72160 358 KB   We need to focus on improving trust with our Vault and Dai users. There have been issues and scenarios in the past where some users may be cautious using our Vaults and Dai, but we want to focus on generating trust with these users. These are challenges we are facing trying to reach bigger companies, banks, NDOs and OTCs across various countries.   3840\u00d72160 344 KB   3840\u00d72160 351 KB   One of our challenges concerns conversion between Dai-USD and Dai-FIAT.

When you adjust one, do you need to adjust another, or is it the tail that factors into that linear decrease of the curve?  Emilio: Tail is a different parameter. In this case, it\u2019s not relevant. Those who don\u2019t know about tail, it\u2019s similar to what we have in Liquidations 1.0. It\u2019s a time limit on the duration of the liquidation. In this case, the Risk Team decided to use cusp. They define tail to be 2hrs 20 minutes instead of 2hrs 18 minutes. The fact that tail exists and allows you to have the freedom of deciding which parameters you want to use.   Akash: What happens when nobody wants to buy at the minimum price? Does it reset? I\u2019m thinking if the fair value price drops very fast while being below the minimum price, nobody will then bid that minimum price.  Emilio: When it reaches the minimum price, no one can make a bid anymore. There is a possibility of resetting the function, and there can be incentives to do so. The initial price then gets recalculated into the new market conditions.     Open Discussion  Keeper, Optomism, and Liquidations 2.0 1:22:01  Christopher Mooney: Is anybody planning to run a Keeper now that they don\u2019t require capitalization?  David: I am not because the bots set up in the space are overspecialized and able to beat me. I\u2019m waiting for a Dao or service that will allow me to participate without much setup. BrianMcMichael: You can borrow collateral from the auction contract and then sell it on the market and buy it back. This provides somewhat of a Flash Loan solution. We would like other aggregators to integrate some of these auctions.   Akash: What do you think about people who will try to front-run?  Kurt: That will probably happen. It\u2019s an acknowledged challenge within the Ethereum space as a whole. If it gets serious, we will plan on other designs which can lack this single block composability property, such as batched auctions with sealed bids containing various properties. Akash: In the first sets of auctions, people bid above fair market value. They are trying to drive away other auction participants. If one person is continuously winning, how do you combat that? Kurt: The protocol doesn\u2019t care, but vaults are being liquidated, and the vaults are recapitalizing. However, you can worry about being overly reliant on a single participant. If something happens to that participant, the auctions may not get covered. We believe Liquidations 2.0 is a lot more resilient allows for more participants. Akash: Is there a game theory audit on this? Kurt: We don\u2019t have a game theory audit. But we have relative audits and more available soon.   LongForWisdom: We are working on in-depth documentation for parameters in Liquidations 2.0. We are trying to prepare them to release on Monday. Kurt: A long-term direction to think about Liquidations 2.0 is along the lines of encouraging cooperative protocols. B protocol has been discussed a lot and is now abling liquidations to happen more predictably. These kinds of solutions are the more efficient direction to focus on if you want to recapitalize. Ethereum is fundamentally flawed by the exact things that make it great; composability, transparency, MEV, and others. These characteristics will have to be solved in a major way. The future can involve app-specific chains or migrate to DeFi specific chains due to a lack of infinite possibilities. We may eventually get to the area of Polkadot and Cosmos through roll-ups. Ethereum may break down into a network of blockchains.  Frank Cruz: NICE!! (very excited)   Akash: Does Optimism solve any of these problems?  Kurt: It really depends on the scenario. For some things, it can be better.

Taking place on Thursday, January the 21st, 2021, at 1700 UTC. My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the governance facilitator at MakerDAO. We\u2019ve got an agenda today as usual as well as some general updates. We have a few segments today concerning calculating VaR. Please, feel free to interrupt during this call. We\u2019d love to hear from you. This week, we had an out-of-schedule executive on Monday to increase the ETH-A and wBTC-A debt ceilings. We reached the ceiling on ETH-A, which has now passed. We are close toward reaching the ceiling for wBTC-A. However, there is now space to create DAI using ETH on ETH-A. We had several polls last week. The polls that completed are successful. Greenlit polls are still ongoing. We should see a lot of those changes being included within tomorrow\u2019s executive, which will also include the ETH-wBTC-UNI-LP vault and the USDC-ETH-UNI-LP vault, along with other changes. In terms of the governance domain, I don\u2019t think I have any substantial updates from last week. I\u2019m continuing to onboard new contributors, which seems to be going well. I\u2019ll be giving a more substantial update next week or the week after. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Updates Peyton Rose Governance at a Glance 02:35  It\u2019s been an active week for MKR holders. The surplus buffer has officially increased. We now have a little less than 6 million DAI left before our typical buy and burn operations resume. We had exciting news for the rates increase; we peaked at an all-time high in terms of stability fees generated per second. For those that don\u2019t know about it, makerburn.com is a great way to check out the rates and stability fees. The website has a live update of system surplus. If you click on stability fees, you can see our growth rate per second. Right now, it\u2019s about $1.10 or 1.1 DAI per second, which is pretty exciting. The volume weighted average price per DAI is sitting very strong at 1.001.  Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated. Discussions   RWA Risk Onboarding Sections & Using Long-Term Loans  SebVentures and Williamr from the RWA team bring a pair of informal polls to get community feedback on the process and parameters for their onboarding process. They\u2019re both looking at how they describe their onboarding in terms of risk selections, what they bring to the community, and what we want to see more of to better understand how they\u2019re evaluating the products they\u2019re bringing into the forum. They\u2019re also looking into using longer-term structures for the loans using RWAs.    Road to DAO: the Core Unit Operating Model  Juanjuan discusses the new MIP set he proposed with contributions from ElProgreso & Iammeeoh, which seeks to define the path to a fully functional DAO without Maker Foundation support. I believe Juan is going to speak to that a little further today. It\u2019s really well packaged and lays out the groundwork toward progressing to pay our own teams and operating entirely separate of the Foundation.    Incognito brings anonymous DAI transactions  Andrey_Incognito unveils anonymous DAI transactions via Incognito and asks for some collaboration with the community. Feedback is requested in terms of how we see this being used with Maker.    Signal Requests   New vault-type for ETH with a higher LR  Ultraschuppi signals a new vault type for ETH after some comments from Risk concerning ways to safely increase the protocol\u2019s exposure to the ETH asset.    Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 06:23  Much like last week, every minute of our day is busy. This means I don\u2019t have my usual list of things to rattle off, but I\u2019ll mention that we are deeply engaged with auditors right now. There are several changes that we have to make to liquidations 2.0. We\u2019ve been working on that. The entire team has dropped everything else and postponed as much stuff as we can. We\u2019re pretty heads down into liquidations 2.0. This is a good week for us to work on it because the community executives will be happening this week. The MIP21 stuff was bumped for liquidations 2.0. However, Lev\u2019s made several requested changes to the MIP21 stuff. We had pushed back last week because we wanted unit tests. Lev found a bug that none of us saw in the manual review. Lucas and the team from MIP22 will be reviewing this situation, and they are actually taking a look right now. Generally speaking, liquidations 2.0 is currently our high-priority-interrupt. Whenever we get feedback from the auditors, we will drop everything we\u2019re doing and focus on this. We\u2019re expecting to have most of that code pre-finished for Monday next week. After that, we will flip our focus back over to MIP21 and get it into Kovan. We\u2019re even hoping to prepare it for mainnet next week. As soon as that is finished, we\u2019ll flip gears over to MIP22. A good portion of the code is written, but we still need to do a full review. That\u2019s the timeline right now. And, of course, we will try to fit in LP collaterals and stuff like that. I want to hand it off to Sam because this week is the community executive. Sam has some stuff that he\u2019s been working on. He and Will have been working together, so maybe Sam could give us an idea of what is going on this week?  SamM: As Chris said, Will and I are taking care of the executive this week. There\u2019s quite a bit going into that. We have two new UNI LP, which are wBTC-ETH and USDC-ETH. We have several debt ceiling adjustments to link MANA, BAT, tUSD, and PSM, which will also get a lerp module that will slowly increase the debt ceiling to the 500 million target over the next 12 weeks. We will increase the dust to 2,000, review the signal results for the vault compensation for working group payouts, and then whitelist Instadapp on ETH-USD. That\u2019s it for the community executive.    Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 10:46  Yesterday, we deployed the new LP Oracle\u2019s for the WBTC-ETH and USDC-ETH LP tokens going live tomorrow. We spoke with the auditor, ABDK that Lev had connected us with. We scoped them out a bit, and they seem legit. They forwarded us an audit that they did for Tornado Cash, and it seemed very thorough. The timetable they gave us stated that they should be able to do it during the beginning of February, and then finish by February 15th. We should have this audit back at the very latest end of February. The turnaround time on that is going to be reasonably quick. We should be able to increase the debt ceilings relatively quickly after incorporating these changes. Given that short interval between now and then, the priority for collateral onboarding apart from the RWAs by Centrifuge and 6S should be to mass onboard LP tokens. When we get the audit results back, we can crank up the debt ceilings. The Oracle assessment for Centrifuge is going live later today and should be included in a polling vote by Monday. Development is pretty much done for Starkware. We just have to apply it for testing in our staging environment. Also, Mark Andre has compiled the MIP10 for that, which should be going live before the end of this week; That\u2019s a big one, so the polling vote will be the following Monday. There are 17 total Oracle\u2019s in that proposal. If anyone wants to look at the sources being used and give feedback on whether they think the data models chosen are correct, that would be really appreciated\u2014especially given the sheer magnitude of Oracle\u2019s that we\u2019ll be onboarding. We\u2019re going to be adding Instadapp to the whitelist of the ETH-USD Oracle to begin performing similar stuff such as DeFi Saver is doing; They can save you from liquidation or manage your position. I want to mention a large amount of time it takes the Oracle domain team and me to write up the polling votes and stuff. I would like to propose a MIP where adding someone to the whitelist shouldn\u2019t require a governance proposal. There\u2019s usually no reason we would reject anyone. Also, it provides more money for the DAO once we turn on the Oracle fees. The only thing that needs to be checked is that the smart contract reading the Oracle value is closed out and is private. We don\u2019t want anyone to steal the Oracle value from there. They have to come to us to get the value. The Oracle domain team already completes these evaluations anyway. I\u2019ll submit this MIP proposal before the community, and we will have a discussion about it. Nonetheless, I think the Oracle domain team should just have the authority to add people to the whitelist. It is important to note that the Oracle domain team should not get the authority to remove anyone from the whitelist. That would give them leverage to disrupt protocols that are using Oracle. So in the situation that we were to remove someone, governance would step in.  Comments 17:06  Matthew Rabinowitz: One quick question on that, concerning ETH. Maybe there\u2019s a scenario where we as a community would like to consider giving ETH as collateral, or we can just give the pricing of ETH for free and not have a gate in or out like everything else. Given the depths of how many people use ETH as an ecosystem, it is a critical business model. I believe it\u2019ll help focus the effort of MakerDAO being the source of pricing for ETH into the network.  Nick: Yeah. I have thought of that before. I think it\u2019s a good idea. We should talk about it a little more on the forum to see what the rest of the community thinks. David: I had Allan Niemburg from Yield Protocol on the community call this week. One of the questions we spoke about was how they relied on our Oracles without being whitelisted. They\u2019re reading the price feeds in a work-around way. Giving free access to the ETH oracle for early-stage projects is a great way to cement a future customer as they intend to support a bunch of other assets that have Maker vaults.    Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 19:00  Yesterday, we published a risk evaluation on a farmable cUSDC crop joint adaptor, MIP30. We also proposed parameters for this vault type. I suggest you read the risk assessment since this vault is a bit more complicated. It has a unique risk profile compared to other vaults that we onboarded so far. We don\u2019t think that this kind of vault will be prevalent. Still, it may be heavily utilized from the start because the yields that could be achieved here by leveraging this kind of vault could measure well over 180% APY. This is after a 7% stability fee collected by Maker. This adapter could also be handy for any other LP tokens that have liquidity rewards. This is important because Maker can position itself quite uniquely. We also began evaluating the next batch of UNI LP tokens, which we already know have high demand. Within the upcoming days, we will be evaluating the USDT-ETH UNI LP pair, which has been greenlit recently. We may also include the DAI-USDC UNI LP pair, which is still pending to be greenlit. The launching poll for the debt ceiling instant access module implementation for other vault types passed today. We\u2019ll need to propose parameters for each vault type. We\u2019re going to roll them out in a few batches each week or perhaps all at once; It depends on whether or not we can find an easy formula to determine all the parameters needed for each vault type. We don\u2019t believe we should implement this module for stablecoin vaults or PSM because it may limit the DAI supply when most needed, such as during liquidity crunch events. We\u2019ll probably not include an instant access module for something like PSM. It doesn\u2019t make sense if you\u2019re using the lerp module, that adjusts the DC anyway. Last week, we started preparing a budget for the risk team. The risk team consists of a decent number of people. It is already six (or even eight if we count part-time people working collateral evaluations.) We need to properly rate this core MIP proposal to understand how to propose budgets aligned with this.  Questions 22:27  Frank: I want to circle back to the crop joint collateral risk evaluation you put out yesterday. In that piece, you mentioned that Compound Governance might change the COMP rewards\u2019 speed, which is distributed to specific markets; in this case, it would be cUSDC. You also mentioned that it creates a problem for Maker\u2019s Governance. Do you think the Maker community should have a team of ambassadors who communicate with Compound Governance and try to build a beneficial strategy for both protocols? It\u2019s the same thing for keepers, right? I read a post regarding keepers being worried whether 15 million DAI box is enough. You commented there, and Greg D brought up how keepers do not have enough liquidity. You wrote that you feel that keepers have more capital these days than four months ago. Do you still feel that way, and do you think we should have ambassadors like Greg D to keep in touch with these keepers and other people in the community to make sure these keepers have enough liquidity? This is a big question, sorry about that.  Primoz: In regards to Compound, this is already effective. This is not an issue. The yield on USDC is acceptable. What I wrote within the risk assessment is that other upcoming governance changes are being proposed. We need to keep an eye on them. One of these changes is the cool-down period for COMP claimed. If they implement it, this may affect the adapter, but Lev should know better. There may also be other things. We\u2019ll need to keep an eye on their governance and react as soon as possible. They have a similar procedure, before something gets implemented, they will discuss it on forums. There\u2019s an active signal, which has 2 days before it is executed. I think monet_supply who is on our team has been active there. Therefore, he knows what\u2019s going on. About Keepers, we know that Maker\u2019s risk is struggling a bit about mitigating risk, and we\u2019ll talk about it at the end of the call as well. The current limiting factor is being the 15 million box. Of course, we would want to increase that if we were confident enough that keepers had enough capital. My speculation was that perhaps the keepers\u2019 ecosystem evolved in the past six months. They should have more capital on their hands but this only speculation, and we don\u2019t have any evidence. We attempted to evaluate the keepers\u2019 on-chain reserves, but it\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s hard to look at their wallets and say this is the amount of money. The last decision we\u2019ve made on 15 million box was more or less based on the feedback we got from keepers. It seemed small but was still good because if they said a high number, this would have been a problem. We know a high number is always beneficial if they\u2019re hostile. If Greg is here and wants to comment on this? We need a proper way to communicate with keepers to get feedback, which we are missing. Gregory DiPrisco: The problem we have is that it\u2019s a very cumbersome infrastructure to run right now. There\u2019s not much incentive to run it because there aren\u2019t many auctions. You\u2019re waiting for a one-off event that may occur twice a year. As a desk deploying capital, they don\u2019t want to do that. The other issue is that many of them have compliance departments that have to approve all of these things. Suppose this infrastructure is made redundant by liquidations 2.0, which it seems like it will be. In that case, they won\u2019t want to put in the effort to go to their compliance department to get a whole set up approved for something redundant in a couple of months. If we didn\u2019t have liquidations 2.0, then I would recommend that we take a more significant initiative to go out and ensure that there are keepers. However, given the reality, it\u2019s almost pointless to do that because you\u2019re only going to be doing a significant initiative for only a few months.   Frank: Got it. Primoz, I\u2019ve been hearing old school billionaires saying there\u2019s a lot of euphoria right now in the traditional markets. How do you sleep at night? Tim Black has put out the market relay letter this week, and it shows that there\u2019s about 35 million DAI to be liquidated at $1071 ETH. What\u2019s your feeling on that? Do you think we\u2019ll be able to handle that liquidation if these whales don\u2019t pay back in time?  Primoz: The good part is that collateralization ratios are higher than they\u2019ve ever been in the past. The portfolio looks healthier than it was ever before. Nominal exposure is still significant, which is concerning. During the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been mentioning my concerns. On the other hand, I can see vault users are a bit more sophisticated. As the price falls, you may see people unwinding. However, ETH-B looks a bit worse. If you look at auctions today, they just started kicking up. It\u2019s not perfect, but we may need to do something, and we\u2019ll discuss it at the end. Greg: Sounds good, thank you.    Sebastien Derivaux Real World Assets Update 30:00  We are working on the legal documents provided by Centrifuge to see if everything will work as smoothly as expected. There will be a post within the following days. We hope that there will be, at some point, a legal team at Maker to provide more insight. We are also working on figuring out how to make long-term investments, which relates to the poll on the forum. We have a lot of prospects, and a lot of people want to borrow money from Maker. Some are very good. However, it\u2019s always challenging to put those propositions inside the current structure. That\u2019s why I\u2019m turning to the community to see if long-term lending is an option. Obviously, every time someone wants to borrow from us, I tell them it\u2019s either MIP21 or MIP22. The trust models are going through Centrifuge because we don\u2019t want to increase the Smart Contracts and Oracle teams\u2019 load. This way, we continue to use the tools we have at our disposal.  Lucas: If the call is going to be as short as last week, I think it would be great to have a little discussion regarding interest rates and the long-term versus short-term borrowing. I would love to see what the community says. How do we deal with the demand for longer termed assets and various interest rates compared to traditional banks and funders? Let me know if that\u2019s possible. LongForWisdom: Yeah, we can definitely come back to it later if we have time. As I said earlier, we will get a relative presentation from the Risk Team. If anything, we can come back to it in a future call. It\u2019s an exciting topic.    Amy Jung Community Development & Operational Support Team Update 32:50  We want to remind people there is a limited duration beta program that the data services (an internal team in the Foundation) has dropped. The API given in the program will allow you to receive historical data on MCD vaults. It\u2019s just one piece of a whole suite of products that are coming. Therefore, if you want to participate, the details are here. It\u2019s been exciting to see a lot of the community take over many of the developments which are happening. With that in mind, moving forward, we have Anna, who\u2019s coming on to cover the community development from the calls. Beginning next week, she\u2019ll be covering those updates. We do want to consolidate some time so that all the mandated actors are able to discuss and cover. At some point, we\u2019re going to have too many facilitators. Therefore, Juan and I will consolidate our operational support roles, and we\u2019ll go back and forth with announcements every other week.  Juan Peg Stability Module Update 34:42  The PSM UI is out, which is a community-driven development. We\u2019re very happy with the final results. If you haven\u2019t seen it, check it out, it\u2019s deployed on IPFS.  Collateral Call Update 35:54  Yesterday, we had a call with Harbor Trade Credits on RWAs. The video is already on YouTube if you want to check it out, and notes are coming soon. Next week, we will have Lido bringing ETH 2 staked back to ETH 1. I also have a presentation about the Core Unit Operating Model. I don\u2019t know if you want me to show it now, or we can do it at the end of the call. What do you guys think?  LongForWisdom: If it\u2019s five or ten minutes, we can fit it in now.    Core Unit Operating Model 36:49 1185\u00d7655 69 KB  The Know Your MIP call #3 will be hosted by Prose on Monday. We\u2019re at the cadence of one call per month. A lot of people helped doing this; therefore, it\u2019s not my own work. Thanks to everyone that helped and had provided feedback on the forum.  1185\u00d7665 67.6 KB  The Foundation is following early news by now. Also, due to regulatory measures, it\u2019s not able to meet all the governance requirements. Sam requested a budget, which is a perfect example. Primoz had mentioned it. Another subject is the growing complexity. There are new teams that are showing up. Therefore, we want to approach this as a framework.  1193\u00d7653 36.9 KB  The core unit pricing model is the first step. It\u2019s a phased approach. The idea is to have DAO primitives. They are designed to have an easy transition and capable of accommodating the current structures with minimal changes, which is very important. People have been asking about Domain Teams and current MIPs. The idea is that those things will work under this new framework. We don\u2019t change everything that we receive from the newly delegated operations by the Foundation. Ultimately, anything that they won\u2019t be able to do anymore, we want to be able to do it. We wish for a coherent framework. We don\u2019t want governance only voting on things that are hard to understand and keep track of.  1184\u00d7662 88.2 KB  As I had mentioned, we want a phase-based approach. What we\u2019re focusing on right now is the initial approach with this MIP set. Adding the temporary measures that we\u2019ve seen, and hopefully, we can reiterate with more MIPs and MIP sets in the future.  1798\u00d71018 111 KB  The plan of this MIP set was flexible and modular. The DAO has revenues and wants services in exchange. They want to maintain and grow the protocol. The Core Unit is the minimum unit to do this. The DAO can provide the recurring cash flows and expect the service in exchange. Everything is clear and listed in a MIP. A Core Unit is straightforward and very flexible. It has a name and a mandate. There are facilitators with their name under commitment. This is something that was changed based on the feedback we received from people. It used to be one, but now we think it\u2019s better to have many or many per Core Unit. Lastly, we have the budget, which is governance saying, \u201cokay, you have this budget.\u201d This is the implementation, and the breakdown is the rationale behind it. The facilitator with this budget will hire contributors to become a company and hire employees to form a DAO, split into several Core Units, and bring another facilitator to help. It\u2019s quite flexible in that sense. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for.  1801\u00d71010 122 KB  Moving to the next slide as an example of a Core Unit. Any resemblance to reality is pure coincidence. Let\u2019s imagine this Oracle\u2019s Core Unit. The mandate is quite complicated because they\u2019re covering a lot of tasks. The facilitator is Nick. He would place his commitment and information, governance trusts him; therefore, they accept him. That\u2019s the budget. Governance thinks it\u2019s fair, so it\u2019s agreed, and then he does a breakdown saying this is what devs cost in the industry, etc. We want to keep it very, very simple. Nick would be able to hire either contributors or a company if he needs an audit, for example, or if he wants, he can organize it in the DAO. After that, we would have various questions such as; can Nick form two Core Units? Potentially, yes. Can a domain ream split into two Core Units to specialize? Also, yes. We want to keep it flexible. We think that the current structure of having domains is not enough for everything that we want to achieve within the next year, and this is the first step.  1802\u00d71003 134 KB  Modular approach means that we want to be compatible with current MIPs and also future MIPs. For example, you can see that someone could do a manual suck or implement a Keg in the budget. We have the MIP42 that was published for RFC this morning. That\u2019s potentially something else that could work with this budget or other implementation we may think of in the future. It could also be several budgets; One could be for salaries, and the other could be a bonus. A Core Unit could have one or multiple budgets assigned to it with different rules and require different implementations. That\u2019s somewhat the plan. The same goes for facilitators. This is applicable for anyone who wants to develop a multi-sig MIP or powers in a Core Unit, maybe something to do with reporting or accounting.  This would be compatible with this first step.  1814\u00d7994 150 KB  Next steps are for the community. We\u2019re going to do a Q&A \u201cknow your MIP\u201d call on Monday, January 25th. That\u2019s this coming Monday at 8:00 PM UTC. Join us. Prose will post the agenda soon. Then we have also created a #Core-Unit-Operating-Model-Onboarding a Rocket Chat channel. I know that it\u2019s not the best name, but at least it\u2019s descriptive. Ideally, anyone that wants to fill in a sub proposal or has any questions can get help there, and we can all help each other. We are in touch with different people to get help; Legal help, for example, if someone needs to form a company. Then we will be paying those people that are helping us. That\u2019s on the pipeline.  2048\u00d71431 73.3 KB  Regarding this MIP Set. I need to incorporate all the feedback. Thanks again for all the feedback that I\u2019ve received. The second step is I\u2019m aiming for republishing during next week. A significant change that\u2019s happening, as I mentioned, is multiple facilitators per Core Unit, but It could be one. The rest is almost cosmetic.  1811\u00d71002 91.2 KB  We can get this out by submitting it and voting. Call your whale friend for support. I\u2019m looking at you, PlanetX. Thanks again for everything. I don\u2019t know if there are any questions or if we have time for questions. You can join us on Monday. There\u2019s also an excellent video that Iammeeoh posted in the forum where he goes more into details about different possibilities. Any questions?  LongForWisdom: I think we\u2019ll leave the questions at the end of the call. Just to keep things on track for this meeting, if that\u2019s all right. I would encourage everyone to read those over. Either now or after Juan completes the updates. It\u2019s a significant step in the DAO\u2019s development, and it\u2019s great to see. Good job to everyone that was involved.    ",

There are many dependencies there, but the idea is excellent to formally include in RFC.  1980\u00d71092 178 KB  I would like to touch on the difference between what conception and RFC are for MIPs. Whenever a MIP is initially posted, it\u2019s in conception. After MIP editors reach out to the author to fix basic formatting and make sure nothing\u2019s going too crazy there, it gets moved to RFC.

I think we had one presentation in April last year. Then I had one in October on risk premiums on ETH vault. Andy has been kind enough to improve the model; He added correlation metrics, which measure Value at Risk on a portfolio level. This is an essential metric because Maker\u2019s risk exposure has been growing exponentially within the past few weeks. It has added many new collaterals in the last months. We have finally increased the current surplus buffer. This kind of presentation should give us some insight into how well-protected Maker truly is. The presentation should understand this risk profile and begin thinking about risk mitigation decisions because debt exposure can continue to grow. We may want to act sooner rather than later. I\u2019ll let Andy present his work, and then we\u2019ll have some discussion at the end of his presentation.  Andy McCall 1830\u00d71020 67.2 KB  My name is Andy. You\u2019ve probably seen me in the forums. I\u2019ve been around for a long time. I\u2019ve been helping the risk team for the past month or two to refine the old collateral risk model and run simulations for them.  1796\u00d7974 328 KB  I won\u2019t read this full disclaimer here, but this is a holdover from previous presentations that the risk team has done. More or less, this says this isn\u2019t financial advice, and you should consult your own advisers on those matters. I\u2019ll post this slide after this is done.  1820\u00d71008 76.5 KB  I\u2019ll give you a brief nod to the risk team\u2019s previous work and some improvements made to the module as part of the project. That\u2019s the first half. We\u2019ll look at simulation results during the second half.  1816\u00d71012 201 KB  We need to talk about Value at Risk (VaR). You may hear me use this term. There is a nice little definition that comes from Wikipedia; VaR estimates how much a set of investments may lose given a period. You have a bell-curved type shape, and this red line represents the VAR at 5% on this particular bell curve. The area shaded in red is 5% of the total area underneath this curve, which is 8.2, but that\u2019s not important. This is to give you a sense of what we\u2019re talking about here.  1051\u00d7576 56.4 KB  The nominal risk at Maker is growing. Today the max theoretical debt ceiling is approximately 2.2 billion. You\u2019ll see in this call some historic comments concerning specific media figures and making statements such as \u201cthere\u2019s this much DAI at risk in the Maker portfolio.\u201d This VaR metric helps make statements that I\u2019m half quoting here; it says, \u201creasonably confident that Maker losses will not exceed x depending on your confidence in the given year.\u201d You can potentially use that sort of information to help inform your stability buffer decisions, rates decisions, and more. It gives you an easy-to-consume format to talk about how risk is growing within the portfolio. Hence, as you raise the rates, you can point to this metric and say, look where this number is going up.  1804\u00d7992 122 KB  Here\u2019s a link to the collateral risk model. Here\u2019s the source code. I highly recommend these two previous presentations. Last year, the risk team built a module that runs this Monte Carlo simulation. It helps estimate things such as expected loss to inform stability fees and evaluate risk, predicting the worst-case type losses that this vault type can generate.  1768\u00d7974 124 KB  That model allows you to simulate a hypothetical vault type, but it has some issues. These issues revolve around the practicality of its use. There\u2019s a bunch of inputs you need to come up with to actually run a simulation, and a lot of these inputs, especially a few ones, in particular, are quite complicated to derive. Over the past month, we\u2019ve written some software to quickly throw this out for a given collateral type. However, you need to account for it, not telling you the evaluated risk across the whole portfolio. You can\u2019t merely sum that up. Hence, the model needs to be improved a bit further. We can run these simulations and determine what the portfolio\u2019s overall evaluated risk is.  1792\u00d7996 128 KB  Slippage is one of those inputs that are difficult to evaluate. In Layman\u2019s terms, slippage is what we stand to lose at auction once somebody defaults in the position. Basically, it\u2019s a function of keepers\u2019 profit expectations plus the price impact of liquidating things. I have a link here on the YFI slippage analysis, which is also where I got this graph. I highly recommend somebody going in there and looking at it. There are five or six pages worth of random math that the risk team put together to create these four lines. I\u2019m dumbfounded every time I look at it. I wrote a program that can do the calculation performed in the spreadsheet here.  1784\u00d7988 158 KB  Using this, we could determine the slippage for each collateral type. Having those slippage values allows us to look at how vaults are being collateralized. We can simulate almost every vault type and develop an evaluated risk number for each one, but that\u2019s not enough to know the portfolio. We need to understand how the losses will be correlated with each other. What we assume now is that they will be associated similarly with the price movements. As I\u2019ve noted here, this is probably not a perfect assumption. Still, it is interesting in terms of risk mitigation because what it says is that the losses will be highly correlated.  1774\u00d7972 47.9 KB  Here\u2019s some matrix math for you. There will be some links in the notes on how you can derive this yourself. Using that correlation metrics and the vector of your vault type losses, you can do this matrix multiplication to determine the evaluated risk of the entire portfolio, which we\u2019ll go over in just a minute.  1794\u00d7988 61.3 KB  With all that said, here are some figures.  1744\u00d7986 92.4 KB  This is an output of this model\u2019s slippage calculations. The only takeaway I would point out on this slide is that there have been many calls in the forum to raise the ETH debt ceiling. According to our model, you can see that we\u2019re now getting into the range where the slippage for ETH is relatively high. This is why you see pushback coming from the risk of continuing to raise the debt ceiling there.  1764\u00d7978 94.4 KB  The evaluated risk numbers are essential. They are based on the past 90 days of trade data. They are currently being favored because there\u2019s been a bull run happening during that period. However, a few vault types are not included in these numbers, which I have written here in gray. These are any stablecoins, the Uniswap Liquidity tokens, wBTC, and PSM. The reason for this is basically because there\u2019s some debate on how to calculate slippage. I thought it best to leave them out and ignore them. These numbers are sufficiently high where I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary to talk about them too much. Here are a few arbitrary confidence thresholds I picked. For every number you see here, n, for example, 1-n, the model predicts the probability of single-day losses exceeding. This is the number in the right column. The model predicts a 20% chance of exceeding 86.4 million in the next 1 year period of time.  1768\u00d7964 61.4 KB  I want to point out which is relevant to current affairs on the forum is ETH-A versus ETH-B. These two are the highest amount of exposure from that set of vaults that were simulated. They count for almost all of the evaluated risk. You\u2019ll notice in these forum threads that various risk team members are commenting, \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable raising these things.\u201d You can see how ETH-B contributes more proportional to its exposure size. It\u2019s probably not that surprising, but you get more bang for your buck in raising your risk exposure every time you increase the ETH-B debt ceiling compared to raising the ETH-A debt ceiling.  1786\u00d7854 105 KB  I\u2019ve linked the website here to where you can find this quote. This quote says that there\u2019s a term called VAR breach that states we calculated a 20% percent chance that the loss will exceed x. It doesn\u2019t state how large that loss will be if it exceeds x. Let\u2019s say saw the model calculate a 1% chance of exceeding 1 million. Also, let\u2019s say there\u2019s a half a 0.5% chance that the loss maybe 100 billion. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the statement of a 1% percent chance that loss will exceed 100 million. Be a little bit careful with those numbers. They\u2019re often misinterpreted, and they don\u2019t speak to the nominal size of any potential VAR breach. It only speaks on the likelihood that they would occur.  1748\u00d7918 114 KB  I\u2019m ready for questions, but here are some potential starters on what you may do with this information, as well as some further extensions we could make to the model. I\u2019ll just take a break right here and see if anyone wants to chime in and ask questions.  Chris: Yeah, with those VAR values, is that a 20% chance that we\u2019d lose 80 million over a year, or are we thinking of a single shock event? Andy: It would be a single-day loss. Chris: Jesus. Andy: Last year, during March, a single day event created 8 million worth of bad debt. It\u2019s similar to that thing. Chris: Yeah, that\u2019s very different from my intuition, so thanks for illuminating that.   Seb: Does your model take into account a box of 15 million?  Andy: That is a good question. It does not consider the box. It is totally okay with liquidating infinite amounts of money in a given day. Seb: Okay. Would you say the situation could worsen if the box is 15 million and can liquidate on the 15 million pair within six hours? Primoz: With a box of 15 million, it really depends on price trajectory. It usually protects from worse events like zero bids. If we adjust it for the box, we will get more optimistic numbers. On the other hand, the model is not taking into account people unwinding before getting liquidated. We can\u2019t really model for every little thing due to human behavior. On average, the slippage curve, which is the most essential input, is still realistic. This is where the losses come at the end.   Gregory Di Prisco: Did you say that you\u2019re using daily VAR?  Andy: It is the representation of the worst day. If you go back, these numbers are adjusted to predict every year. This doesn\u2019t say every five days, you should see a loss of 86 million. It\u2019s more like every 5 years. You should see something along those lines. Gregory Di Prisco: Okay, for example, oracles update once per hour. Theoretically, we have hourly exposure instead of daily exposure. Is it accounting for this? Primoz: No, it\u2019s simplifying it. What the model is doing is calculating losses on each day using thousands of periods. There\u2019s a one year period, and then this crash occurs, and then you have random block thousands of simulations. Therefore, you get this distribution of losses. The average of those losses is the expected loss, which is the risk premium. We use this when you set rates and want to look at the worst-case events. This is how banks do it as well. They calculate evaluated risk because they want to be hedged against worse case events. This is the number that we simulated. This is the one percentile of the worse losses that we simulated. Gregory Di Prisco: Since we\u2019re using daily, isn\u2019t it safe to say we\u2019re being pretty conservation considering our liquidation exposure is hourly? Primoz: Yes, and no. Even if it\u2019s hourly in one day, you can have many liquidation events every hour. There\u2019s also a box, and not every auction gets cleared. There\u2019s slippage daily for the whole portfolio, but I get your point. We could make an alternative simulation that would focus on a shorter time interval. It can simulate the price trajectory during the day and micro estimate that loss, which can then be extrapolated into a yearly fee. It\u2019s doable. Still, it\u2019s not how the model currently works. Gregory Di Prisco: I always worry about an OSM attack where you can see a vault go under 100% collateralization. I do that for the rule of thumb for the worse hourly candle in March and overlay that into the vault and assume that will happen.   Primoz: I just want to jump in here. I wanted to have this discussion today to think about how we could catch Maker and whether there are tools available that I\u2019ve discussed. There\u2019s a surplus buffer we may need to think about increasing even further. We also need to agree that it takes time to get to a ten million figure. It could take two or three months to get to ten million from now. This may already be too late. The second thing is the box parameter we had discussed. It\u2019s difficult to justify a higher number, but I think it could be very beneficial. Liquidations 2.0 would improve the slippage functions; The number would be much lower. This is why liquidations 2.0 is currently a priority from the development perspective. Regarding higher liquidation ratio vaults, We will need to choose between business growth and risk management. As I said, those figures are based on the current collateralization ratio distribution, which is very healthy. The collateralization ratio can quickly change if present vaults believe that the current Ethereum price is stable and are planning to mint more DAI. This will push the ratios down there towards 250. Suppose we get to some equilibrium state that we observed in the past. In that case, we may have 50% of the portfolio lowly collateralized, and then those numbers become even worse.  LongForWisdom: Yep, I want to thank Andy for that presentation. That was great. This is something where people need some time to absorb and come back to within another meeting. Are we going to post that presentation anywhere else? Andy: I will post it to the forum sometime after this.    Procedural LongForWisdom January MIP Governance Poll Review 01:25:10  LongForWisdom: That sounds good. Alright, let me cover the thing I forgot earlier. Prose and David pointed out that I forgot to confirm that MIPs will continue to the executive votes next week. On Monday, we will have the MIPs executive vote to confirm. Six proposals will confirm and mark them as ratified once passed. Looks out for that on Monday. As usual, I will leave the call open if anyone wants to discuss more with Primoz or Andy.

My name is LongForWisdom. I am the governance facilitator at MakerDAO. As usual, we\u2019ve got a bit of an agenda to get through. We\u2019ve got updates from the people at MakerLand. Please feel free to interrupt and voice any opinions or comments. We would love to hear from you. I will start with governance updates. We had ten polls up last week. We had debt ceilings and Instant Access Module polls for six assets that passed. We had onboarding polls for LINK-ETH UNI and UNI LPs that passed. The interim DAO budget poll had passed, and we had the rates proposal poll that passed. We should see all of these in the executive tomorrow. Last week\u2019s executive has passed earlier today. We saw less participation than usual in both the executive and the polls. Presumably, because the crisis of gas on the Ethereum network is now massive, this is something we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on going forwards. We\u2019re starting to get concerned about the prices and impact on voting and other parts of the Maker protocol. I spoke to Smart Contracts this week regarding emergency measures to take if we start having problems. There should be avenues we can look into if things get unconscionably bad. Happy news; The MIPs portal that Juan and Dspot have been working on is coming along well. It\u2019s up at mips.makadao.com. However, this is a pre-alpha version. If you want to get an idea of what it looks like, go and have a look. There\u2019s also a feedback button that you can press if you have any feedback. We\u2019re expecting this to get a lot more polished within the next few weeks. Concerning onboarding, we continue to get Prose and Eli up to speed. Eli\u2019s going to have a lot more time soon, and we should begin to see him around more. Prose and Eli both helped set up the weekly polls last week as well as this week. We\u2019re performing the knowledge transfer stuff because we need to get the redundancy in the governance domain. The documentation continues to move forward. I will merge some PSM documentation by linking it in several of the upcoming polls that concern the PSMs. Finally, as a reminder, the governance core units MIP set proposals are up on the forum. I would appreciate it if people could read them and give any feedback. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Updates Peyton Rose Governance at a Glance 04:40  Three-point summary  DAI remains in hot demand, with just short of 2B in total DAI supply ETH-A secured its spot on the MakerDAO mantle as the first vault type to issue over 1B in DAI The Peg remains very strong, with the daily VWAP still hovering at $1.001   ICYMI - Announcements   Vote tracking is arriving at Maker! Check out the forum post for full details! Yearn.Finance recently used a MakerDAO vault to restore user funds after exploiting a V1 pool targeting yDAI.    Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated. Discussions   Pre-MIP discussion: PSM flapper  Andy_McCall brings a pre-MIP discussion on using USDC from the PSM to buyback and burn MKR tokens.    Minting New DAI to Offset Lost DAI  Jeycryptz11 makes a case for minting DAI to offset \u201clost\u201d DAI sent to contract addresses both as a means of customer support and a way to counteract the deflationary pressure of the lost DAI.    Signal Requests   IAM-DC Parameters: LRC-A, BAT-A, BAL-A, MANA-A, ZRX-A, KNC-A, RENBTC-A  Last Chance to Vote! primoz puts forward the second round of Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module parameters for new vault types. Voting ends tomorrow, Feb. 12th.    Adjust ETH-A DC-IAM-line (2021-04)  Signal Extended! Ultraschuppi signals raising the ETH-A debt ceiling for the 4th time in 2021. Signal extended to get more participation, so please vote!    Initial Flash Mint Module Fee  Hexonaut signals community preference on the fee imposed for Flash Minting in anticipation of MIP25: Flash Mint Module.    Lower PSM-USDC-A tout Parameter  Hexonaut signals lowering the tout parameter for the PSM-USDC-A vault type. This change would make it cheaper to exchange DAI for USDC, a trade currently underutilized for the first PSM.    Turn stablecoins DC to 0  Alexis signals changing the Debt Ceiling to 0 for all non-PSM stablecoin vaults, with options to start with USDC. Polling ends in one week (Feb. 18th)!   LongForWisdom: Thank you, Prose. I want to note that people mentioned in the chats that they\u2019re having trouble keeping up with the signal requests, which have recently gone up. If anybody has any suggestions about how we can re-structure the forum to keep things more accessible, or if anyone needs any advice on keeping track of these, please reach out.  Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 10:25  We didn\u2019t do any work on the collateral onboarding sheet this week because we have a lot cued right now. We didn\u2019t have any cycles to spend on it, and we have plenty of work to do. We\u2019re planning to do the collateral assessments for UNI-V2-AAVE-F and UNI-V2-WBTC-DAI, which should be completed by Friday. We\u2019re also going to do FC and WBTC-B. These are the alternate collateral types for FA and WBTC with various parameters. They are interesting because we don\u2019t have a collateral assessment for them. We might use this opportunity to get a technical assessment for each one. Next, regarding collateral to Kovan, we\u2019re trying to get MIP21 in on Friday, which I\u2019ll talk about in a second. We\u2019re iterating the tooling right now on Dss.Exec Lib. There are changes that we want to make. We\u2019re slowly discovering what makes that tool very useful. For MIP45, Liquidations 2.0, we had minor updates to the RC; We made some small enhancements to Liquidations 2.0 through a separate branch for gas optimizations and stuff. The auditors are continuing to work on the main code frozen version. We have met with the auditors and are working with them right now. Also, we did work over the last couple of days on MIP21. We are suggesting some changes and are setting those up for review. I think we\u2019re still waiting on opinions from Lev and Will concerning one of our changes. We\u2019re looking at the unit and integration tests to deploy it to Kovan on Friday. Matt, you\u2019re on the call. I want to mention that we\u2019ll do the conduit testing sometime. For MIP22, there is an outstanding PR that needs review. We\u2019re still \u2018cooking with fire\u2019 on MIP21. We\u2019re pushing through that, and then we\u2019ll flip over to MIP22. For security work, we began defining the security roadmap as well as the mission statement. We also began documenting a tutorial for formal verification. There\u2019s a couple of DEFCON spells we have. In case you\u2019re unfamiliar, they\u2019re spells that we use in case of emergency. We\u2019re getting them all pre-deployed and ready to go after completing a few updates. Also, we need to add the UNI-V2-DAI-USDC to that. We\u2019re going to detect whether or not the stablecoin is even there and then fix those. These will be deployed on Friday. We will get it all ready to go and plant it on Sunday when gas is cheap. I think we\u2019re well converged on a solution for PAX-D, PAX-G, and USDT. These are fee-charging tokens on transfer. USDT doesn\u2019t have it turned on yet, but in theory, they could. There are a few changes that we need to accommodate to prevent double charges on fees. This will open up other types of collateral that do this to our system. We\u2019re building a factory for deploying the flips and the joins. Gas is getting expensive to the point that the collateral types from last week cost us 2,500 dollars to deploy the flips and the joins for them. Sam had shared the Flash Mint Module as well, which we\u2019ll be looking at shortly. Does anybody have questions?  Brian McMichael: That was comprehensive. Frank Cruz: With everyone asking questions about L2s: what would be the best response for the community or outside the community asking where Maker is regarding L2s? Brian McMichael: Right now, we are focused entirely on these RWAs and then some of the other things that have been voted in. It would be nice to focus on L2 research. Some other teams inside of the Foundation have been researching it as well. However, I don\u2019t know if we can announce anything as of yet. We don\u2019t have a published solution. But it is on the agenda, and I would encourage Governance to prioritize that research. Juan: Brian, this would be a great core unit. You probably know people who are better suited to or want to tackle this issue. Brian McMichael: We would relish the opportunity for R&D as well. Right now, we\u2019re grinding on all of these MIPs that are coming through.   Wouter: I can give a little more color to the L2 research inside the Foundation. Two things are ongoing: We have been doing research and thinking about ways to deal with L2 solutions, and there are many ways of integrating with those L2 solutions. However, it\u2019s good to understand that trust issue comes with security implications, which led us to believe it would be good if the community were to have an evaluation framework expressing some opinions about Maker L2 solutions. Let\u2019s see if there is a consensus about what a good solution would look like. Then we go from there for further implementation. After that, we may propose an evaluation framework that might start talking about these L2 networks. The other part is that we have been looking more, from a practical point of view, to look like a DAI integration for one L2 solution. I want to mention that it is happening. This is a more practical approach to looking into the nitty-gritty details. I expect at least a discussion on the forum centering on this topic. I don\u2019t want to speak on behalf of other people, but my gut feeling is that these discussions will begin to pop up within several weeks. After discussions initiate, we can start to accelerate on these ideas.  Frank Cruz: Cool, thank you. LongForWisdom: I think that everyone\u2019s comforted to know it\u2019s on someone\u2019s radar. That\u2019s appreciated. Thank you. Wouter: I would add one thing to that. Please don\u2019t listen to this and conclude that the Foundation is working on it. If there are any other initiatives or people with an idea of how we can approach this, please continue to work on that regardless of the work happening within the Foundation. We don\u2019t have all the answers at the moment. There\u2019s a lot of input and feedback that we require from the community. Juan: I think that this is something governance would pay for. It\u2019s a matter of organizing the budget, getting it approved, and having a facilitator and a core unit organizing it. It\u2019s all doable, and we should think about going through with it. LongForWisdom: If anyone knows anyone interested in building L2 solutions for the DAO or Maker, please refer them to the forum or the chat. We can help walk them through the material.    Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 21:58  We\u2019re going to deploy the LINK-ETH and UNI-ETH LP tokens oracles later today. Those are going into tomorrow\u2019s executive. We are not looking forward to that because each of those contracts will cost around 400 dollars to deploy. That\u2019s how the world works right now\u2014crazy. In terms of assessments, we\u2019re working on the CF-DROP assessment. We\u2019re working on the WBTC-DAI assessment and a few others. On the L2 side of things, I can contribute a little bit to that discussion. We\u2019ve been working on integrating Starkware into the oracles and for DYDX\u2019s upcoming launch since they\u2019re launching on Starkware. It\u2019ll be fantastic to get experience working with Starkware functions. We are experimenting with L2, so once optimism gets going, we can look in that direction. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have customers of the oracles who will be transitioning to L2 as well. We should talk about gas and audits. The ABDK audit for the LP oracle is underway. We expect to get that back in just over a week. Then we\u2019d have to incorporate the feedback followed by community consideration toward raising the DC for the LP tokens. We should be talking about ways to mitigate gas usage for the oracles. It\u2019s crazy right now. If the current gas prices continue, it would be 16 million a year just for gas prices, which is insane. There are some things that we can do. We need to decide as a community on what we\u2019re willing to do and what we\u2019re not. Right now, we update most assets on a one percent threshold. That means that every time the price changes by one percent, we\u2019ll update it. We have certain assets for very large vaults. For example, ETH and WBTC are on a more strict interval of half a percent. However, what is some things we can do? We could increase the threshold for assets that don\u2019t see much usage to a three, four, maybe even five percent threshold. This would cut down costs. However, Risk would need to be consulted because due to existing collateralization ratios, if the oracle price doesn\u2019t update, that can be a five percent discrepancy to the actual trading price. Another alternative is that we begin delisting some of the vaults that aren\u2019t seeing much usage. I\u2019m personally not a big fan of that approach. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time integrating these assets, and just because they don\u2019t see any usage now doesn\u2019t mean that things can\u2019t become very popular in the future. For example, let\u2019s consider yield farming, which made some assets very popular on Compound. I think that there are external factors at play here that can boost the demand for one of these assets. I would hate for us to miss out on that. We\u2019re researching terms of what we can do to reduce the gas footprint. For example, one thing we could do utilize zero-knowledge proofs. They have a constant gas cost for verifying proof. Right now, it\u2019s about five million gas, which is a lot, but you could update a bunch of oracles at once. This could save gas depending on how many oracles you\u2019re trying to update. However, that comes with issues if you\u2019re trying to keep a specific price update sensitivity. Not all of them are going to need to be updated at the same time. In those cases, the gas cost for verifying the proof, the 5 million gas, may not be worth it if you don\u2019t have enough prices to update at a single time. There\u2019s no magic bullet here. Chainlink is probably spending just as much, if not more, than us because they\u2019re not very gas efficient. It\u2019s an industry-wide issue and not specific to our oracles. Nonetheless, this is a concern that my team will heavily look into over the next several months because the current situation is just not sustainable.  Frank Cruz: I would switch the gears here and not concentrate on gas as much. I was listening to this podcast about one of my favorite subjects lately: NFTs. one question that came up was: what\u2019s missing for NFTs? One of the answers is an exchange such as UNISWAP, where I can trade my hash mask for a little Miquela NFT. I\u2019m bringing this up because somebody said they are predicting Maker will be the first to offer vaults for NFTs. However, how difficult would it be to have a price oracle for NFTs? Nick: I love that there are rumors about us being the first to do anything. Usually, we\u2019re the last to do anything. This sounds like our public image has flipped in terms of how to price an NFT. This is a complex problem. Most NFTs are very illiquid. The potential for manipulation is very likely. Imagine someone is hoarding little Miquela\u2019s and then manages to corner the market and drive up the price. If they wanted to sell all of their little Miquela\u2019s, they would crash the entire price to zero. But if they borrow in Maker against all of them, it\u2019s like a way to liquidate without experiencing the slippage. It\u2019s very tricky to price NFTs in a way that can\u2019t be manipulated. The risk level to the system is also relatively high because NFTs are trending right now. We need more use cases on Ethereum besides just finance. The underlying value of these things is hugely questionable. Yes, they can be entertaining. However, let\u2019s take Cryptopunk as an example; they had a price spike, and they\u2019re trading around ten thousand dollars at a minimum or something like that, which is fantastic. Let\u2019s say the market crashes and goes to a bear market in six months. What will be Cryptopunk\u2019s worth? It\u2019s probably going to crash, and very suddenly as well. It\u2019s not a smooth process. I would want to see the market and the liquidity for NFTs first to develop some more. Frank Cruz: Yeah, that makes sense. Even if NFTX does their hedge fund vehicle of many various NFT collections, they\u2019re going to do the same thing. They already bought this zambape, if you\u2019re into soccer, from PSG. They paid a hundred and something thousand for it. That wouldn\u2019t work in the short term. Nick: We want to see the market for these NFTs mature and develop a bit more. We should not be a first mover. I don\u2019t see an advantage. The risk is too high. Frank Cruz: Sounds good, man. Thanks for the commentary. Nick: I know that\u2019s probably not what you wanted to hear. Frank Cruz: I\u2019m thinking the same thing. I would love to see a hash mask trade for an NFT Cryptopunk, but it\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon. If you guys know him, Rack mentioned that Maker would be the first to offer me the ability to get a 2000 DAI loan. Nick: I\u2019m glad we have Rack in our camp.    ",

Those are the ones from last week.  LongForWisdom: Thank you, Charles. The next greenlight polls will be up on Monday. They will be up for two weeks and not three days. Charles: Yeah, they\u2019ll be up for two weeks and end on March 1st. At the beginning of the March governance cycle.    Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 46:05  Regarding collateral evaluations, we\u2019re posting another two UniLP evaluations this week, which are renBTC-DAI and AAVE-ETH. We posted this week\u2019s DC instant access module parameters for smaller vault types. This should go into the on-chain poll next Monday. If confirmed, we should have all vault types using this module apart from UniLPs. We plan to propose these parameters very soon. For stablecoins, we\u2019ve already suggested that this vault type module wouldn\u2019t be applicable due to DAI liquidity crunch reasons, etc. Lately, we\u2019ve been monitoring the growth of ETH-A debt exposure. The Rates group may propose another rate increase on ETH-A because the last one hasn\u2019t been implemented yet. However, it should be this Friday if confirmed. The idea is to try to lower the pace of debt growth. We\u2019re also doing simulations on ETH-C vault types, the newer vault type with a higher liquidation ratio. The idea here is to stimulate ETH-A vault users to migrate toward safer vault type, such as ETH-C or new DAI minting from ETH to be done on ETH-C. The strategy could be a bit questionable because it doesn\u2019t seem that borrowers are very rate sensitive at the moment. It remains unclear what the spread between ETH-A and ETH-C would be needed for users to move to a vault type that\u2019s less capital efficient and cheaper. We also made a report on auctions this week using this year\u2019s data. In summary, there were 150 auctions this year. Maker collected all penalty fees, which is about half a million. Vaults were getting the appropriate amount of collateral return. Still, there was one auction where Maker didn\u2019t collect the total amount of the penalty fee, which was the DAI-ETH Uni LP vault that was liquidated. There was only one keeper at the time, which raises concerns about how many people bid Uni LP auctions. This is important to know if we increase the DC on Uni LP after the oracle audit. We are thinking of raising the minimum bit increase parameter, called back, and potentially the penalty fee. Hopefully, this would attract more keepers because, on the one hand, there\u2019s a higher incentive for keepers to bid due to higher back and minimum increase. If there\u2019s a higher penalty fee, vault owners might be more cautious with not getting liquidated. Additionally, we\u2019ll also try to do a bit more PR about this potential change around DeFi. We\u2019re primarily focused on liquidations 2.0 and doing our regular related risk work.  LongForWisdom: Thank you Primoz, looking forward to seeing what sort of parameters come from risk in terms of liquidations 2.0. That should be interesting.    Seb Real World Finance 50:47  Three points this week:  we\u2019re continuing to work with legal to improve the infrastructure of RWAs, which will be a long-term process. We are working on eight collaterals for the next few months. It\u2019s not something that will be quick. We still have three collaterals waiting in production. We are easing the onboarding process for asset originators because they don\u2019t understand all the MIP and DeFi stuff. Now we have a sheet explaining all the processes. This will be on the forum very soon. We are continuing to discuss with a company that was greenlighted long ago to provide something that may be better suited for both parties. We began to work on the implication of term loans. We are lending for a fixed rate for a given amount of time. That\u2019s something that was posted in the forum with YFI-DAI. It also speaks about implications; if you promise to lend for a long time at a fixed rate and the DAI supply decreases, there can be a liquidity issue. Research should be done in this direction to if it\u2019s a significant risk. If there are any risks, what are their limitations?   LongForWisdom: Thank you, Seb.  Amy Jung Operational Support Update 53:33  We started posting our updates on the forum. You can see them in the thread using the links, and it\u2019ll give you the highlights. For the KYM, we did the Keg last Friday. Then we did the long-term lending module by Alan from yield protocol, and Levwho co-wrote it. The collateral onboarding happening next Wednesday included Fortunafi, the yield and lending protocol for tokenized real-world cash flowing assets. we\u2019ve been working on the core unit, beginning with the community call, which included Frank, Juan, Imeo, and Prose. In this call, they broke down the unit and answered questions. A second section consists of a few MIPs and sub proposals. Therefore, the core unit framework itself, risk, Governance, real-world finance, suggests leaving comments and reading through it one final time before it goes into a frozen period at the end of next week. Please check it out and leave comments. We have two new core unit drafts: the growth core unit by Nadia and then a marketing core unit by Seth. We have a few that are still in draft that was recently posted. We have the smart contracts and front-end, both written by Derek. Then we have strategic communications PR and marketing by Kathleen. We have Seth, who commented that it\u2019s not supposed to be competitive to Kathleen, but instead is a different kind of approach. Therefore, if you see a core unit created, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do, create, or propose that core unit. However, it is recommended that you check out whether someone else has written or spoke about that core unit. Check for redundancies or overlaps. Juan and I are also working on our core unit. I always encourage people to check out Imeo\u2019s core units I wish existed. This is where all the brainstorming comes together to say I wish something like this had existed. I encourage you to reach out to your network. Maybe you want to become a facilitator or build a team around one of these core units. We all need to all work together and pull together our network to ensure we have all the bases covered. We have a call coming up with Opolis in two weeks. It will be the Tuesday community lead by David. Details will be coming soon. that will be another kind of employment service provider. I like to think of it from an employee\u2019s perspective versus the accountable perspective proposed by Dennis. We had a few interesting conversations on the core units and topics concerning facilitator responsibilities. Some questions included inquiries such as the expected facilitator responsibilities as a high-level. The answers to this are written out in the core unit frameworks. The main thing to know is that you\u2019d be responsible for the budget even if you have someone doing accounting for your company. If something like half a million goes missing, you\u2019re going to be the person who has to communicate and get details on that. Another responsibility is the expectation of communicating with Governance by being with the facilitators and things like that. It\u2019s essential to communicate the monthly reports. Stuff like that would be considered the responsibility of a facilitator. That being said, depending on how you structure your team and how it\u2019s organized, you can be a PM and also a facilitator. You\u2019re the person responsible. Keeping in mind that there are responsibilities of a facilitator. If you have a busy role, you might not always be able to cover both. You might have a facilitator who\u2019s responsible for communication. They don\u2019t have to be two separate roles. If you\u2019re torn between two, but feel like it all folds in can do both, then you can be both. It doesn\u2019t make sense to have two separate budget line items, such as a facilitator budget and then a PM budget, because you would be playing both roles. Any comments or questions on that?  LongForWisdom: I\u2019ll sort out something. The other key part of the core unit structure is the core unit mandate. That\u2019s the place where facilitators can define any extra responsibilities they want to take on or commit to in terms of what the core units could be doing for Governance and the DAO. Amy: Yeah. A good example of that is SebVentures, who hosted his monthly report. He gave a January monthly report of what that team has been doing. in your core unit, you can decide what you want to be responsible for. One of the things that operational support spoke about was giving a quarterly report of all the core units. Long said it\u2019s dependent on your mandate as well. The second interesting conversation that\u2019s been brought up is facilitator salaries. LongForWisdom and his governance budget kicked this off. You should check out that thread. Generally, there\u2019s been conversation around the expected transparency and what expectations a proposed core unit or salary that someone decides to be public could involve regarding other future core units or facilitators that go into it. I should add that some teams would rather have that more loose. They might say this is the general amount that we\u2019re going to spend on people, and that\u2019s okay. We see different structures. I would open the floor up now if people wanted to bring up any questions or thoughts.   Amy: Juan, would you like to experiment with something?  Juan: No. I think that each core unit should choose the level that they want. You can go for super transparent, where everything is public. Some companies are doing it in the open. The fact that it\u2019s the blockchain and everything is transparent should not trick you into thinking that that\u2019s required. Nick brought the point that sometimes it\u2019s harder to negotiate with different peoples or attract talent if everything is public. I tend to agree with his point of view. However, Brian brings up another important point: privacy. If you\u2019re a developer making half a million, that could be a security issue at some point. Chris: Yeah, that\u2019s my recommendation for almost everybody thinking about this. Everyone can make their own choices. However, I would highly recommend that you scope the budget at the domain team level that this sort of utopia of radical transparency is a giant dangerous security trap. You do not want people knowing how much you make because the tokens that we get paid out in the space are bearer assets. You should think carefully about the operational security and whether or not you want to have everyone\u2019s salaries transparent. Matthew Rabinowitz: Agreed. The beautiful thing about this core unit aspect is that it has the danger of spiraling into a bureaucracy. There\u2019s an aspect to whatever period frequency of having a unit present, whatever the status, whatever it was done in the previous month or quarter, and outlining the historical and forecasted budget. Amy: If something feels off, it could be in a positive way. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s this massive budget, and we say \u2018that seems kind of low.\u2019 we wouldn\u2019t be able to say how it feels low if it wasn\u2019t vaguely broken down. Maybe it\u2019s the people that are too low, or the people are too high, or whatever it is. I should bring up that for the governance budget and why that was also brought up. While the discussion was initiated around the individual\u2019s value, It is a positive opportunity. People can say, \u2018hey, I think you\u2019re being undervalued.\u2019 We need that kind of commentary in the community to ensure that we have fair pay; otherwise, if no one says anything, people will be undervalued, and people who are undervalued seldom speak up or represent themselves. Matthew Rabinowitz: I\u2019m not even trying to say people shouldn\u2019t be paid. It\u2019s quite the opposite. I want to make sure that it stays efficient. Brian McMichael: I don\u2019t want to cause any alarm, but the smart contracts team lost several developers to better opportunities last year. That needs to be rearranged. Juan: I agree. Also, if you are using a pseudonym such as Long is, it\u2019s easier to be transparent. We all trust him, and we want to keep him doing his job. I mentioned this several times in the forum. Not being pseudonymous may cause issues that you might not be aware of today but can happen in the future.    Anna Kryukova Community Development Team Update 01:06:58  David hosted an informative call with some community members. Here is a link if anyone\u2019s interested to learn more about core units as well as the various questions discussed. Some contributors in community development are also writing core units and sharing them in Rocketchat. There will be more updates in the coming weeks, but for now, everyone is working on core units and community development.  Open Discussion 01:07:45  Matthew Rabinowitz: Regarding the budget, are we planning to have an aggregate view of what the contemplated budget would be for all the units at some point?  Juan: That\u2019s the minimum detail that you need to include in a core unit. There\u2019s the budget implementation, which is the number that the protocol will payout. That\u2019s the minimum that you have to disclose. Then there\u2019s the budget breakdown in which you can go as detailed as you want. Some aggregation is fine, for example, saying salaries or expected salaries are okay. You don\u2019t have to use the whole budget that\u2019s assigned. I hope that clarifies the issue. Matthew Rabinowitz: That\u2019s when you submit it into the forum. What would we want as a collective to see regularly? Each individual, sure, but at some point, will we have an aggregate slide that says what we\u2019re currently spending, similar to what Seb put in the last presentation. I\u2019d love to see what our expenses are going to be in aggregate. Juan: Yes.   Amy: One of the quarterly reports that I had mentioned. There are two phases: One would be the budgets coming in. We would have two months to understand how much we would be required to spend. The second would be to see what we\u2019re spending currently.  Juan: Wouter also says he would not want to be in a hiring interview for three engineers who know the three budgets. But you can say, hey, we\u2019re planning on growing ten engineers. When you hire a couple, you can start doing the math, but there are buffers. You\u2019re considering various things, and it\u2019s not a hundred percent transparent or visible if you don\u2019t want it to be.   Frank Cruz: I was going to change the subject if that\u2019s okay because something interesting came up this week with Seth Goldfarb. He brought up the code of conduct. I\u2019m sure some of you heard about Blockfolio. It became a hot mess for them where the founder, Sam, had to go on social media and try to answer some serious questions. How do we handle the code of conduct for core units? Is that something each facilitator should set a precedent for? or is it something someone from operations will provide with an outline? How does that work in a DAO?  LongForWisdom: That\u2019s a good question. If we don\u2019t set up something in advance, then we will handle it as we go. I think the best practices will evolve from that. It\u2019s something everyone has to deal with. Frank Cruz: We have many really good people here, so I\u2019m not worried about that. As we grow, we should take it step by step. Christopher Mooney: I think Bill and Ted said it best: be excellent to each other. It\u2019s not a complex problem. LongForWisdom: There was a discussion earlier about gas. Someone brought up the ip1559 in the chat. I\u2019m curious as to whether or not anyone has any opinions on that. BrianMcMichael: It\u2019s buyback and burns, which is what we do, right? Sounds good to me. LongForWisdom: I know none of our devs are experts on consensus or the Ethereum protocol itself, but does anyone have any thoughts on what it\u2019ll deliver in terms of gas prices? BrianMcMichael: Does everyone know what the ip1559 is, to begin with? LongForWisdom: That\u2019s a good point. Let\u2019s start with that. Does anyone want to give an executive summary? BrianMcMichael: There are two components. They\u2019re going to increase the block size a little but then change how the fees are managed. There will be a base fee, which is the minimum amount you need to spend on a transaction, and then there will still be a market fee. Everything over that base fee will be a tip to the miner. Still, the base fee for each transaction will get burned and therefore reducing the supply of Ethereum. This will turn Ethereum into a deflationary token. The miners will still get a profit. Nonetheless, they\u2019ll get the tips above and beyond the base fee. SamM: Is there an opcode for the base fee? LongForWisdom: I wondered that too because I think it has implications for your Dss.chron module or something, right? SamM: It would be nice if there were. It would allow us to determine whether somebody\u2019s paying a competitive gas price or not. BrianMcMichael: I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s implemented in the protocol yet. LongForWisdom: The general goal is to bring stability to gas fees rather than drastically lowering them. Matthew Rabinowitz: Is there any approximate timing on when that is going to happen? I\u2019ve heard estimates. LongForWisdom: As far as I am aware, the plan is before proof of stake. But I am not sure.

My name is LongForWisdom, and I\u2019m the Governance facilitator for MakerDAO. Feel free to interrupt. If you have comments or questions for any of those giving updates, please ask.   Governance Update  Payton Rose 01:13  It has been a busy Governance week. Two executives have passed our standard weekly executive that includes the system surplus buffer increase, burn parameter changes, and also YFI-A addition to Liq 2.0. Before the call, we were discussing the burner and surplus buffer. Sam will now jump in and talk about the lerp module he wrote that will go live.  SamM: We are using the lerp module to increase the surplus buffer. It\u2019s set to go from 30 to 60 million beginning tomorrow morning. It will take 99 days to meet the 60 million, targeting approximately 75% towards the surplus buffer and 25% toward the burner.  Payton: Awesome! And it\u2019s permissionless as well, which is exciting.     The other executive that passed was our Monthly Governance Cycle containing all the MIPs for the last month. Big congratulations to our four new core units being Content Production, Growth, MakerDAO Shop, and Protocol Engineering. We also had the Declaration of Intent for eurDai and MIP amendments that passed for MIPs 4, 9, and 0. Those MIP sets added second collateral greenlight poll and allowed MIPs to be amended via the weekly cycle for their first three months of passage. Check that out if you want more detailed information. Concerning polls, all four Liq 2.0 polls passed. This will be moving wBTC-A and all three ETH Vaults into the Liq 2.0 framework slated for tomorrow\u2019s vote. Reminder: there are four days left to submit your greenlight votes on the most recent collaterals. Concerning Gov Alpha, we will have a meeting today with some parties interested in voting delegates. We will discuss the process and the framework. Hopefully, we\u2019ll have a detailed update on that next week. We are working on a GitBook Maker operation manual to assist with protocol knowledge and procedures. It is going to be helpful. We are drafting some changes to the Forum organization, so don\u2019t get too attached to the home page. We are going to be switching things around for the better.   Questions  Aaron: Does the lerp module take into account the payroll deductions from the surplus buffer?  SamM: No. When it was crafted, we were not certain that it was going to pass. Brian McMichael: Payrolls are ultimately going to be handled by the Keg, a streaming solution. The lerp is more of a point-to-point, but Keg\u2019s purpose was built for this. We\u2019ll get that out soon. SamM: Coincidentally, the liquidations from yesterday completely countered the budget. LongForWisdom: Yes, that\u2019s probably true.     Weekly Updates  Forum at a Glance  Payton 5:50 Forum at a Glance - Forum Thread  Three-Point Summary  \u201cHoly liquidations Batman!\u201d April 28th saw over $15M of ETH effectively liquidated from ETH-B, ironically right before ETH hit an ATH. Liquidations revenue kick-started the burner, with over 300 MKR burned in 24 hours   The peg remains strong, with ETH volatility likely to blame for a slight VWAP increase of DAI to $1.002   Announcements  Make sure to check out the MIP45 Audit Summary if you haven\u2019t had the chance yet! It\u2019s the end of an era with the announcement that @Davidutro is Retiring the Community Call. It\u2019s sad. I\u2019ll leave it up to David!   David Utrobin  Community Call Farewell 06:37  On Tuesday, I announced the end of the Community Call in its current form. The Community call has been the longest-running call at MakerDAO for the last few years. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of hosting it. The Community Call covered weekly updates from Maker, issue discussion, special guests, and interesting technology in our space. The scope has been transformed and changed along with MakerDAO. As MakerDAO grows, we are seeing a large growth of specifically scoped community calls happening. I made a forum post showing a graphic of the different types of public calls emerging. It appears to be the right time to retire the Community Call in its current form as a generalized community call. However, out of the ashes, phoenixes will rise (emphasis on the plural). I\u2019m anticipating a lot of more tightly scoped calls. The Content Production Core Unit partnering with Growth and other Core Units will take over that Tuesday slot and do a version of the Community Call focusing on guests, BD verticals, etc. In the meantime, the Community Call is officially retired in its current form.   Discussions   Debt floor and smallholder consequences   @jumnhy\u2019s first post to the forum asks about the state of the Debt Floor (dust) and what the community can be doing for small account holders.    Who do I call, if I want to call MakerDAO?   @purrfection harks back to international politics and wonders how the DAO can effectively communicate with outside groups.     Signal Requests   Increase the DSR   @mrabino1 signals for an increase to the DAI Savings Rate, with multiple options for a \u201ctemperature check\u201d of the community\u2019s commitment to a positive DSR.    Adjust KNC-A Debt Ceiling   @monet-supply signals for action on KYC-A, following an announcement that KyberDAO will be moving to a new token.     Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 10:37  It\u2019s a major accomplishment now that our team is called Protocol Engineering instead of Smart Contracts. Smart contract engineers are now moving from the foundation to a well-structured DAO. Hurrah! The Protocol Engineering team will be hosting office hours every Tuesday morning to make inquiries from other engineers in this space. You can also use #dev or #help on RocketChat for smaller inquiries. The Liq 2.0 executive is in Kovan, which includes all three Ethereum collateral types and wBTC. We\u2019re planning to put it on executive this Friday. It is big in terms of the number of assets under Liq 2.0. If there are any keepers on the call, Liquidations 2.0 is now taking liquidations. Still, we haven\u2019t seen anyone yet using the flash lending capability. There is a reference implementation of a keeper put out by the Integrations Team at the foundation. I want to encourage people to play with that and report any bugs for the two current active types, YFI, and LINK. If you manage to catch a liquidation or force liquidations yourself, and if there\u2019s a bug, please report it in #dev on RocketChat. The strength of Liquidations 2.0 helps us lean on Defi and single block composability to provide the liquidity to backstop the protocol without having a minimum of one keeper running on all the collateral types using that type of liquidation. We\u2019re in the same paradigm that we\u2019re with Liq 1.2, in which we need UIs or capitalized keepers to show up. It\u2019s going to be important that a keeper is running by next week.  Brian: I want to reiterate on the keepers. We had the big wave of liquidations the other day. Those went well with the Liq 1.0 system, and at this point, we\u2019ve got a better infrastructure build-up around Liq 1.0 than we will around Liq 2.0 in the week. There are a lot of opportunities. If we have another drawdown, we\u2019re not in the same place infrastructure-wise as we\u2019re with the current system. If somebody else doesn\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll put out something for a hackathon project because we could use several different reference implementations. We would all like to have more versions of keepers that can interact with the system; ideally, we will integrate with AMMs, which will solve many problems. Still, after the Black Thursday event, we made many assumptions that \u2018if we build, they will come,\u2019 but that did not work. We need your help going forward. Kurt: For future upgrades, the system should prioritize having more infrastructure in place and tested beyond smart contracts before rolling out to significantly large collaterals within two weeks. That is a general risk management consideration for future engineering projects. Chris: There\u2019s certainly risk with staying on Liq 1.2. The liquidation process that we just had that was over 18 million USD almost filled the liquidations box with that one vault that gas liquidated. It\u2019s difficult to know the old auction systems and how well-capitalized these things will be. It\u2019s nerve-wracking at the beginning to see the bids. We were down around 12 million. We were undercapitalized by 12 million on that before the auctions were completed. There\u2019s a risk if we don\u2019t move as well. Brian: On behalf of everyone from the protocol Engineering team, I want to thank the Maker community for making this transition possible.   Chris: Regarding mandated actors, there\u2019s a multi-sig that has multiple members across multiple teams that were funded or will be funded once the monthly executive is executed. It will roughly put three months\u2019 worth of monthly operating expenses for the Protocol Engineering team into a smart contract that would be available in case of an emergency. Right now, it\u2019s funded through Dai. However, this is intended to use for emergencies. There is an entire class of emergencies concerning Dai losing value or becoming volatile. It\u2019s better to swap that Dai for non-volatile equivalent assets like USDC. If we end up in an emergency, we\u2019ve at least three months of funding that will help the team clean things up or reboot the protocol and whatever is needed as long as it isn\u2019t tied to the fate of Dai.  Brian: Benefit of this is we will get Dai back out in the market, and it\u2019s liquid. Second, if we take on collateral types like USDC and those that go bad on this, it\u2019s unlikely that those will also go bad in the same situation that Dai does. We\u2019re trying to diversifying some of the risks through other assets.     Questions  LongForWisdom: With regards to transition, do you guys have the date that you\u2019re officially free?  Chris: I don\u2019t have an exact date, but it\u2019s around the first week of May. Brian: The Foundation hasn\u2019t told us when they are firing us. We will let you know, haha.   LongForWisdom: Should we consider delaying big ones until we have the solid infrastructure around Liq 2.0?  Chris: It has been considered, and it\u2019s that risk trade-off that we just mentioned. The assessment is that with too large a pullback, the old liquidation system can\u2019t perform well. We\u2019re confident that the new system can. It requires a back stopper running. The biggest risk is that we haven\u2019t seen that backstop keeper appears in the community, and foundations can\u2019t run one. LongForWisdom: That seems strange to me. Liquidation works as long as there isn\u2019t a significant pullback. Wherein for Liq 2.0, we don\u2019t know the pullback effect. It could be bad if those keepers aren\u2019t up. Chris: We know that the keepers that exist can handle around 20 million in liquidations. We could anticipate that the bidding we saw with these large liquidations can also occur on a 20 million liquidation. There\u2019re some assumptions baked into it, but I think that\u2019s fine. Brian: If you got the skills, assume that you know there will be a huge opportunity for cheap collateral in a major pullback. However, if everybody has the same idea, then we will liquidate you at market price. If you\u2019re on your own and nobody else has done that, you\u2019re going to get some deals.     Oracle Team Update  Nik Kunkel 22:25  We\u2019re getting ready to post the Oracle Core Unit proposal. I spend most of my days now speaking with lawyers, which is not so fun. Regarding the ABDK side of things, we are already in touch with them to complete the final audit reports and announce it soon as we get that information. We\u2019re going to redeploy all of the existing Uniswap LP oracles to the new version that, through the help of the SC team, especially Kurt, has been optimized. It\u2019s quite efficient and will save a lot of gas fees. We want to do the rollout within the next couple of weeks. It will be dependent on how much we\u2019re trying to stuff inside the executive votes. I am not sure what the SC team planned out there, but we may have to wait until the following week if it\u2019s a bloated spell. The gas limit was raised this past week. We may have more wiggle room than we think. There was a dark feed that wanted to off-board. They\u2019ve already shut down their feed. We need to remove their key from the oracle SC. We also need to add a Defi saver. We will work with those guys to make sure that we get those into some spells. It\u2019s a heavy operation because every time we onboard or offboard oracles, we need to get on a call with them and add or remove the feed. We currently have 15-20 oracles, which is a very heavy operation. We may perform two phases. Concerning Oracle R&D, we have a new pricing tool that we\u2019ve been working on for an extremely long time. It\u2019s been almost a year in the final stages of testing. We want to push it out within the next few weeks. It\u2019s called Gopher. Currently, if you want the price of ETH-USD, you go to all the different exchanges that have ETH-USD. When you have the data, you can go through whatever data processing you want and then spit out the price. That model is inefficient because if you\u2019re querying many exchanges, some of the APIs don\u2019t respond in time, and others may time out. A better way would be to ping exchanges for all the data and prices constantly. You will have all of those prices cached. When you want to know the price, let\u2019s say ETH-USD, you now have all the data for signal processing. In parallel, we\u2019ve another new feature that we call Spire, which enables another P2P solution to back up the Oracle system. Many of you might be aware that we had issues with Scuttlebutt within the past year, particularly thanksgiving. Scuttlebutt is a P2P network where all of the feeds are exchanging price messages. Regarding the Oracle Stack, we want to make sure that everything is hyper resilient. If any of the components breaks, such as pricing tools, then there is a backup pricing tool. If this networking layer breaks, then there is another networking layer. Hence, with Spire, we will have Lib P2P acting in parallel with Scuttlebutt. If Lib P2P fails, we have Scuttlebutt and vice-versa. The next step would be to get the client diversity, just like ETH 2.0 has multiple clients; We have Teku, Nimbus, Prism, and Lighthouse. We want to have multiple reference implementations that follow the same common spec. Right now, we have one oracle client, Omnia. We are beginning to create a second reference implementation called Ghost. after that, I would like to see a third-party team as part of the core unit to give some money in helping to create different client and maintain them. This diversification helps us to stay away from repeating the same design approach.   Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 32:25  We are preparing to release the next batch of proposed parameters for Liquidations 2.0 for the remaining vault types. We will propose parameters for the ten smaller vault types. We will cover them this week, and next week, we\u2019ll propose some parameters for Uni LPs. According to the plan, we have all vault types activated apart from stable coins and PSM in Liquidations 2.0. It should take less than three weeks but depends on the voting process and the Smart Contracts team to implement everything according to the plan. As was mentioned today, @Monet-supply made a signal to lower the KMC debt ceiling to zero because the KMC token is being migrated to a new version. We need to disable the vault. There are a few methods to do that. We will likely propose to decrease the DC. We can gradually increase the stability fee, and at some point, we will probably disable Oracles. We will then see whether the new KMC token will be onboarded soon after because this was the lowest utilized vault. We have seen 10,000 debt exposure on average in the past, and this vault costs Maker more than it was earning through the stability fees. We started preparing for a new set of collaterals evaluations. There was a consensus between other facilitators that the future focus will be on Sushi LPs. A few applications for Sushi LPs were already posted this week, and we will likely soon choose between those pairs to begin working on evaluations. Yesterday, we had an analysis on ETH-B auctions. Surprisingly, the bids were solid this time. This surpassed expectations because ETH-B auctions haven\u2019t been perfect in the past. I\u2019m going to mention a few metrics; There were about 360 auctions in total. The total amount of debt liquidated was 16 million, penalty fees collected 2 million, which is a full collection of penalty fees. There were only 16 auctions where a fraction of penalty fees were not collected. Maker could collect another 20 thousand more Dai. There were between two to three addresses that were bidding, which is more than usual. There were also two-thirds of initial bids or zero bids, something that was observed in the past. The good news is that Liq 2.0 will make zero bids impossible. From the Maker side, the outcome was great. We saw a good response. We also confirmed the box. The pending liquidation size limit isn\u2019t too high. Keepers were fairly capitalized. the most significant metric is the profit keepers made or how much the vault owners lost. This number was good considering the best results because auctions settled on average at 4% below market price. This means that vault owners lost penalty fees and another 4%. We had surplus auctions, the so-called flap auctions. We hit the 30 million surplus. They are doing fine. MKR being sold in these auctions is on average 5% above market prices. There isn\u2019t a large number of keepers bidding in these auctions. On the other hand, we won\u2019t be seeing this huge amount of flaps anymore because we are increasing the surplus buffer unless we have a larger liquidation event again. Besides the ongoing release of Liq 2.0 parameters, we are also working on updating risk parameters. Usually, on our side, at the end of the month, we update three premiums DCs, which are then used for the parameter proposal group that meets next week. We expect to have new suggested parameters for May.   Real-World Finance Team Update  Sebastien Derivaux 38:30  Update on NewSilver: More loan audits were made last week, and now we have half a million invested in this NewSilver vault. We have a call with the legal team next week to discuss monthly due diligence and concentration in Florida. Initially, we made the limit of 30% in maximum exposure of any state in the US, but there\u2019s been a lot of activity in Florida. We will ask him about stopping low-exposure loans in Florida if the threshold is met. Otherwise, everything is working fine. There was also the new drop of investors in the pool, making repayment of Maker loan. That\u2019s why it\u2019s 400k; we can know that all the smart contracts are working from this. Regarding collateral onboarding, we will try to push a new batch of Centrifuge assets either the end of next month or the first week of June to be ready on our side and evaluate up to 4 Centrifuge assets. We will be able to onboard whatever Governance decides. We made progress on trust models as well. Matthew released new documents today. we\u2019re still confused about its success as well as the other ones. I had a call with a lawyer yesterday. A month ago, it was the first call with Arnold & Porter LLP. We had a call with a partner in the US who\u2019s an expert in structure finance, and he has some connections with Arnold & Porter. They also lobbied for crypto in Washington. They have good expertise in regulation as well. I will write documentation about MakerDAO and the regular assets for MakerDAO to help them get up to speed. If everything works, we will begin to hire them next month to audit NewSilver investments. Finally, we surpassed 10 million in monthly revenue, which is an all-time high. I will present the monthly financial reports early next week, and maybe we will be able to discuss them in the next G&R call.  David: How much revenue we made from PSM this month? Seb: I don\u2019t have a hard number, but I saw they were below 1 million, which is relatively insignificant for Maker.    ",

Amy is working in the background on various projects in the foundation. Regarding Know Your MIP, we had Stani from Aave and some presenting KYM #8. MIP50 was very interesting. The recording is on YouTube. Yesterday, we had MCO2, a carbon credit market application, the MIP6 application that is already on YouTube. On the core units side of things, we had Request Network last Friday explaining how to use it and showing their new features. Tomorrow, we will have a workshop to set up OKRs with Andy from SCS.   MIPs Update  David Utrobin 46:06  1394\u00d7756 94.5 KB   1400\u00d7751 81.8 KB   1365\u00d7759 110 KB   1416\u00d7735 182 KB   1404\u00d7739 129 KB   1366\u00d7724 70.9 KB   1405\u00d7744 83.6 KB   1397\u00d7734 113 KB   1400\u00d7721 47.4 KB   Procedural  April Governance Cycle Review  LongForWisdom 51:20  We managed to avoid the issues we had with MKR voters this month, at least for the MIPs. We had trouble getting things passed in time for the executive on Monday. It worked out in the end, but it\u2019s good to highlight this situation. This is the main reason why we are proposing the change to the Monthly Governance cycle, which David referred to as MIP51. Hopefully, that will help resolve the issue in the future. It includes changes to the way that the monthly event cycle works. We may take time next month to discuss it when it goes into voting.   Open Discussion 52:22  Governance Core Cycle  LongForWisdom: This is the moment for everyone to present comments or questions regarding the last monthly cycle. Chris Mooney states that he is in support of the change. It should change the Governance cycle slightly and make things easier around executives. I encourage everyone to read over MIP51 to have an understanding of how things are changing. Also, we saw a lot of new Core Units get ratified. We offer congratulations to those facilitators and those within those Core Units that went through. It\u2019s been fantastic to see more people joining the DAO.   MKR compensation working group  David Utrobin: I am curious whether there is an update concerning the MKR compensation working group? We have to discuss all these queries coming to fruition.  LongForWisdom: I haven\u2019t mentioned it up to this point because the group was not yet ready to publicly state anything definitive. We met last Friday, and we\u2019ve been meeting every day since then to discuss various things. We are making progress. We continue leaning towards guidelines and strict restrictions. The hope is to lay out some guidelines, Core Units that are less sure about MKR compensation. Also, guidelines that allow Governance to compare individual core units\u2019 compensation structures against the guidelines that we put initially release. We set a rough target for May 10th to have something substantial and formal released for everyone. In the meantime, we will continue to work on it. Payton: We approved protocol engineering testing. They\u2019ve got some contracts working, but will there be further discussion on that structure, or will that be included in an upcoming executive? Derek: Are you referring to the mechanism or the quantity? Payton: The mechanism has already been approved in terms of minting or how it\u2019s done. Derek: Perfect. Brian has written a contract called DssVest. We have a specification written up for it. I imagine us submitting it to the forum within the next few weeks. I want to keep the focus on Liq 2.0 for the time being. Nonetheless, it\u2019s written up and will be posted as soon as we get past this hurdle of Liquidations.     Governance and Risk Meeting Structure Discussion  LongForWisdom: Does the structure of this meeting meet the audience\u2019s requirements? Could it be more effective, and how well would it scale as we add more Core Units? Some people state that they like it the way it is. Other people would like to see some changes. Does anybody want to chime in?  Chris Mooney: I tried to change the format of the Protocol Engineering team meeting disclosure. I was doing stand-up with the entire DAO, and we had to surface the important stuff at some point. I like the format of this meeting. I think it\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s going to have to change shape, and it\u2019s funny that it\u2019s \u201cGovernance and Risk\u201d because we are a little off that mandate. It\u2019s more like an all-hands. LongForWisdom: Yes, that\u2019s fair. I have this bad habit of assuming everything is Governance because it all involves Governance knowing things. Kurt: I was going to make that exact point. All decision-making for the DAO falls under Governance.   Aaron (in the chat): When will Growth have a section in this meeting?  LongForWisdom: Probably next week. I haven\u2019t yet spoken with anybody from the new Core Units. They are all welcome to do a weekly update. I encourage you to get in touch with me to slot a regular segment. I hope we will begin to see biweekly updates.   David Utrobin: This call is primarily focused on updates and issue discussion. Eventually, updates will continue to grow. The benefit of having the \u201cissue discussion\u201d as part of this call is that everyone is present; it\u2019s an all-hands event, and you have all of the key people ready to give feedback. If we were to split off the Governance and Risk meeting in the future, my recommendation would be to do a town hall for updates and a town hall for issue discussion. Make sure that people attend both at similar levels of importance. My main concern is with this call becoming way too bloated through the growth of Core Units and issues, etc.  LongForWisdom: The issue discussion concern is important. As you say, it\u2019s a chance for people to discuss whatever they want with all the involved people. I haven\u2019t explicitly considered splitting up, but we could potentially do something like that. We could publically split up this meeting and follow an agenda of the first 45 minutes for updates, and at the end, we initiate the discussion. Anybody can show up to both calls. David Utrobin: Yes, I like that idea a lot. LongForWisdom: Five-hour-long calls are a shock. I want to avoid adding time to this meeting. I know a lot of people find this useful. Some people are already frustrated by its length. It\u2019s one and a half hours long on a regular. I wouldn\u2019t want to push far above that. @juan, I know you had some comments on the meeting. Do you have anything to share? Juan Guill\u00e9n: I\u2019m a little more empathetic. I want to make sure that we don\u2019t talk to only each other and that we are more inclusive. I\u2019m thinking about the objective of this call; what the audience wants and why. I asked many questions to several people. I would like to know if the people who see this once a week believe that\u2019s enough for them? What was the objective of the call: more to discuss things, give updates? That\u2019s the road I went down. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have a solution. I would like to hear any ideas and opinions. David Utrobin: Regarding the discussion section, one of our disadvantages is that we don\u2019t plan very deeply for what we will discuss. Generally, it works out. But it is critical to know who the relevant people are to discuss certain issues and make sure they are available and present for when those issues are discussed. If we do split off into more focused \u201cissue discussion calls,\u201d inclusivity is a huge deal by being able to have everybody there and synced. It\u2019s very important to have that.   LongForWisdom: We often run these calls, and we have fairly full audiences, right? But it tends to be the same people speaking, those that are most familiar. If you are someone in these calls which doesn\u2019t often speak, and there\u2019s anything you want to share with me privately that you think we could do to make it easier, please feel free to speak right now.  Kurt: It\u2019s important to not get in the habit of making decisions on this call. Any call will not line up well with at least one participant\u2019s time zone, And people may have other reasons they can\u2019t make a call. It\u2019s important to emphasize the more asynchronous forms of communication for finalizing decisions, namely the Forum and RocketChat, for more ephemeral things. LongForWisdom: That\u2019s another good point. That\u2019s always been the goal, to avoid actual decision-making in these calls. Generally, we do fairly well with that. We often have people proposing courses of action, but we don\u2019t determine them, not in the regular call. However, there are some emergency examples that we had. Kurt: Many contexts come through in this call. Now that we have the great summaries, people can catch up on them and review the discussions. Thereby, they can raise it in a separate forum post. Even though we don\u2019t explicitly make decisions, sometimes the context of this call carries through to what the decision will be. It\u2019s important to make sure that it gets out there and everyone has a chance to respond.   Payton: Would an anonymous question line help make sure we can get people to answer without necessarily putting them on the spot in front of everyone?  LongForWisdom: Yes, that\u2019s a good idea, especially for those who watch the call but don\u2019t tend to show up live. We could put something like that together. Christopher Mooney: Yes, that\u2019s a really good idea. I\u2019ve seen this done in larger companies, but it also works in our community because people want to maintain their anonymity.   Matthew Rabinowitz: Another idea would be the mandated actors who go through the normal cycle. In many ways, so much of what is being said on those calls could be pre-recorded and put on YouTube or somewhere else as a reference. People could watch them in advance. Those who don\u2019t watch it could hear the top three salient points of that video. This would allow us to get through an entire section much faster where there are all the references elsewhere.  Kurt: Any reasons why you suggest video segments as opposed to a text-based format? Matthew Robinowitz: Either way. Some people prefer to talk. Others prefer to type. LongForWisdom: We considered that before, and the concern I have is that it requires more coordination for anyone that wants to keep up to date. With the current setup, the call is during a fixed time; we show up, and then that\u2019s all good. If it becomes meaningful to participate, I need to read this document, watch these videos, and show up. But maybe that\u2019s something the people and community could perhaps do or would even want to do. Payton has good experience with speeding up meetings, but it may be difficult to enforce it on other people. We can always try.     Legal Team Update  Matthew Rabinowitz 01:10:23  We worked with Chris through the MIP21 circuit and confirmed that the RWA001A moved 50 Dai back and forth. Yesterday, we had a two-hour conference call with WFSF Bank. We went through the entire structure, and they are ready to go. We somewhat of a \u201cchicken in the egg\u201d scenario; the custody account needed to act as a bank account needs to be formed to connect with the broker-dealer. You can\u2019t have that until you the trust is formed. We don\u2019t have the trust formed yet because the community hasn\u2019t greenlighted the transaction. We will perform an interim step; we will use a short form trust agreement that intentionally shortens it. This will be amended and restated by the actual operative document that we\u2019ll be putting in the forum in short order. That will allow us to form the account to connect it to the broker-dealer and short-circuit in a couple of weeks. We went through the trust agreement comments that we put forth. I wouldn\u2019t say they push back. They have some concerns, but they are integrating them.  1399\u00d7839 62.8 KB  This is an exhibit that has not yet been accepted.t this is the general narrative of what we\u2019re trying to advance and into the trust agreement. The entire trust structure includes all the legal documents, credit agreements, and downstream documents. There are hundreds and hundreds of pages that very few people will read. Frankly, the trustee, the LendCo, the trust sponsor are the parties that need to be involved in every line. And they are. The most important idea to grasp is the narrative that we are trying to mimic, what we use with crypto vaults but in a real-world structure. In the context of being a verification agent, the trustee will be responsible for funds that come in and come out before they can issue a loan. Once a loan is repaid, they need to verify the outstanding debt for this given vault and then compare it to the DC. If one is greater than the other, then there\u2019s a certain action they have to take, which cuts off the downstream credit and allows the downstream loans from that to unwind organically. It\u2019s no different if we took the DC on ETH-A, when it\u2019s outstanding at whatever it is, 2 billion, and change it to 1 billion. None of those loans would be foreclosed upon or be liquidated. They would sit there while people would complain that they can\u2019t take out new loans. The context is the same with the DAO\u2019s ability to issue a liquidation order to trigger the liquidation event that the trustee will monitor and check on a routine basis to see if the DAO has initiated that. I always want to stress that this is a nuclear event and, as I posted in the forum earlier today, how MakerDAO is protected in this context. The LendCos have certain covenants pursuant to the credit agreement. If they don\u2019t meet those requirements, the trustee will be the party that will liquidate LendCo faster than the DAO ever will. We spent some time yesterday working through the verification process. This is an essential point for every trustee that is ever going to be a trustee for what this type of structure will be used. It\u2019s going through the educational process of learning how to read it at a core level. It doesn\u2019t involve cool UI and UX - I like Dai Stats and Maker burn; it\u2019s all neat but, if somebody was nefarious, how much of that could be manipulated? We have to make the game theory for how we get the trustee to read the blockchain. Fancy UX portals are neat, but how do they go down the next layer? I sent out a forum post, and Chris went through it and confirmed the sequences. I have a verification portal that I\u2019ll be using with WSFS Bank. It\u2019s currently in the early alpha stage. the imperative point would be that they need to learn how to affect Etherscan. This is marrying two worlds that never were destined to date. How do you have a trustee that\u2019s spectacular with paperwork and perfected UCC1 senior position loans as well as looks at blockchain and the numbers? We do have a step sequence portal that\u2019s largely automated. We would feel on their perspective. It\u2019s like being a pig on roller skates; \u2018You want me to do what? I click on this contract, and it says ilk, what does that mean?\u2019 We can all smile at it, but it\u2019s true. Eventually, they\u2019ll realize it is not a big deal and turn into the routine course of business. That is all I have to cover right now. We are in the final stages. I posted the custody agreements. We were patenting the security agreement, which is a UCC1 document. It\u2019s very straightforward. After that, we have the credit agreement, which is 60 pages, followed by the trust agreement. These two last documents contain all the salient points. The community needs to compare them to the term sheet presented. Some minor changes are lightly in favor of the DAO. None of the changes were against it or in favor of me. one major change is the addition of another tenant, which was already outlined in the downstream documents, including Tesla.   Further Discussion   Someone: Our RWA Core Unit has attorneys looking at this. Have they given back any input to the community?  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Yes. We are in discussion with Arnold & Porter LLP. We are waiting for the final document from Matthew. We will use them first on the assessment of NewSilver. We will also have those lawyers review this structure. It might take some time, and we could first look at the structure ourselves. We have a good lawyer, Christian, in the community. He might help with that. He is used to those structures. We need to find a good strategy between acting fast, being bulletproof, or 100% confident. First, we need to be sure that it\u2019s working. If minor details need to be fixed later, it\u2019s less of a big deal. For instance, I checked some documents, but I thought that Cayman Entity has ownership of the funds, and the funds are transferred in US dollars in them, no longer in the Delaware trust. It\u2019s the initial MIP. I saw that Martin is now director or at least has executive power in the Cayman\u2019s Entity. It seems to be a trustee of the Delaware trust as well. That\u2019s what we need to figure out. Frank Cruz: It was going to be Dai that went into Cayman, right? S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Dai would go to the OTC broker, but then the broker would send the funds to the Delaware trust instead of the Cayman Entity. Cayman Entity was the owner of a smart contract but unable to do anything. This was why they couldn\u2019t prove that they were the owners of the wallet.   Matthew Robinowitz: The way this structure is contemplated is that there is a trust sponsor, which is the party that creates or causes the creation of a Delaware statutory trust. In this case, it is a Cayman exempt entity. It becomes in possession of Dai and automates by the smart contract to sends that Dai. There is a gap where it becomes legal in a \u201cterm to rest.\u201d Dai is sent, bumped, or pushed to the broker-dealer, which will have irrevocable transfer instructions to immediately exchange that dive for US dollars and send them to the Cayman Entities account at WFSF Bank. That account then has irrevocable transfer instructions pursuant to that escrow agreement to transfer those US dollars to the trust that is now underneath and governed by that trust agreement. It\u2019s exactly the reverse whenever funds are returned.  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Yes, the irrevocable transfer on the bank account is something that I don\u2019t know is possible and how irrevocable it is. LongForWisdom: These are questions for another meeting. Thank you for the update, and it\u2019s good to see progress made. I will talk to you all soon!

All the updates from MakerDAO Governance and Risk Call #156 in this snippet.  Team Updates  GovAlpha GovAlpha Weekly Update Governance:  No new executive this week.  Current executive from last week is still live. Three community greenlight polls are still active from last week.  GovAlpha Core Unit:  LongForWisdom on vacation so everything is fine  Synced up with DUX to go over how GovAlpha uses the Voter Portal and what tools and additions could help GovAlpha Sebix working on the forum organization task, classifying the many tags and finding new Discourse Plug-ins to make finding information more accessible. Delegation is showing up strong this week, with 2 Executives passed and over 55k MKR delegated to our Recognized Delegates.   Forum Forum at a Glance: August 20-August 26  Protocol Engineering  Last week\u2019s executive, available tomorrow, is adding: MATIC, PAX-PSM  Team Review:  GUNI Oracle:  Joined by the Gelato team, we added tests, now ready for the next executive, will target a DC of 1-3M     Staked ETH  PE work here is done - targeting mid/end of September to align with Oracles sprint   Related to StakedETH is the stETH/ETH Curve Pool  A conversation Nik/Sam have been discussing is that we could use CropJoin to integrate with such a pool, so keep an eye out for that one   Aave D3M  Aave team completed a review We have one outstanding PR, just waiting to merge We\u2019d like to get a formal audit so I\u2019m talking to auditors about timing    Forum:  Collateral Assessment  SolarX   DssCharter  Today we published the Formal MIP submission supporting Institutional Vaults There\u2019s been lot\u2019s of good conversation about fixed-rate solutions so we\u2019ll be taking some time to review these alternative options Deco, Akiva, Sense    Layer2:  Arbitrum  Last week we did a high level review with the team This week we had a call with Arbitrum and are doing a deeper dive   Optimism  No updates on the Optimism front as we\u2019re been gearing up for the Arbitrum launch    Other News:  PAX Token Name Change from PAXUSD to USDP PAX-PSM-A will remain unless we create a new ILK   Risk   Vault protection analysis posted today:  Plan is to track these metrics in time, automated dashboards. Combine these metrics with vault\u2019s DAI borrowed utilization data we started collecting. Short to Midterm goal: assign risk scores to Maker\u2019s vault owners and track scores in real-time.   Polygon 100m treasury loan offer with terms included sent to Polygon team, awaiting feedback. Plan to create a framework for institutional and treasury type of permissioned loans. Proceeding with Nexo institutional vault risk evaluation, but first awaiting feedback from the community on loan terms. KNC-A offboarding parameters posting soon. Post following on final timeline and steps regarding other collateral offboarding.   Oracles  New Balancer pool for stETH and ETH provides another place to query staked ETH price, not just one. Adding the LP token for stETH and ETH in curve would align well with cropjoin. Since \u2018cropjoin\u2019 hasn\u2019t been utilized, this may be an opportunity to maximize rewards on stETH, curve, and LIDO rewards. Core unit internal discussions: products and expansion.  Primary focus is other L1s and L2\u2019s. We are evaluating things like Optimism, Arbitrum, and some L1s like Solana Avax, etc. Anything EVM compatible is easier. Non-EVM compatible requires contractors or working with those teams to port oracle contracts over\u2014plenty of collaboration opportunities.   Another discussion: Bridges.  Optimism fast Dai withdrawal requires an oracle. Potential to create a standard for router contracts on every chain that works like message handlers. It\u2019s many to many compatible. Since it looks to be a cross-chain world, bridges will be a great product. Additionally, the economics are better since you don\u2019t have to push prices continuously. Charging margin on transaction costs is locked in profit.     Real-World Finance  Matt Robinowitz gives everybody a huge thanks for everyone\u2019s support for 6S. 6S executive passed. Risk assessment of Solar X thanks to Christian.   Gov Poll expected on Monday.  SolarX Collateral Onboarding Risk Assessment.   Financial analysis of the institutional vaults by Mark.    Institutional Vaults Economic Terms.   Expanding the team.   Partnership with JST Capital. Luca (@luca_pro) will work on an audit on FortunaFi. Full-time position to be onboarded.   Growth Growth CU weekly update  Growth follows the partnership strategy created by Greg in the Foundation times. We will be helping BanklessDAO to create a proposal that will bring to Maker a team that will help us create and propagate the Maker message. Loopring will launch EthPort, which will provide cheap L2-L1 composability. EthPort allows users to interact with Maker directly from Loopring L2. We joined forces with the DUX team and started having conversations with the leading custodial solutions to integrate the Voting Delegation system to increase participation in the Maker governance. Tokocrypto will list DAI next week against major cryptos, and then DAI/BIDR (Indonesian Fiat) will be listed later.

My name is Payton Rose; I go by @Prose11 in the forum and chat. I am one of the Governance Facilitators at MakerDAO. We like people to get involved and ask questions or comments, so please, do not be shy if you have something to say.   Weekly Updates  Governance  Payton Rose 1:35  Three community greenlight polls are live, end on Monday, August 30, 16:00 UTC. Maker Governance - Polling  Reminder: For the governance process, part of the ranking on how we do the green lights is based on the vote differential between the \u201cyes\u201d votes and the \u201cno\u201d votes.   Ratification Polls for Monthly Governance Poll wrapped up on Monday, August 23. Executive Vote passed - Vault Onboarding, 6s Updates, and Reducing Vault Liquidations  Spoke with mandated actors; we will not be putting an Executive Proposal on Friday, August 27th.   Forum at a Glance  Artem Gordon 5:06 Forum at a Glance for Aug 20 - Aug 26  GovAlpha Core Unit update  Payton Rose 09:52 GovAlpha Weekly Update  Governance facilitator, @LongforWisdom, on vacation Met with DUX Proposed Core Unit, going over how GovAlpha uses the Voter Portal and what tools and additions could help GovAlpha.  @Sebix has worked on forum tags, forum plug-ins, optimize forum organization, easier to navigate. Looking to implement plug-ins soon, will provide broader updates in the future. Delegation - Yesterday was Meet Your Delegate #04  Over 55K MKR delegated to Recognized Delegates, a quicker turnaround in comparison to 1-2 weeks ago.   Protocol Engineering Team Update  Derek 12:38  Last week\u2019s Executive will be available tomorrow, adding MATIC and PAX-PSM. This week, we had a team review of the GUNI Oracle. Ari from Gelato Team joined us. We\u2019ve added some tests, and UNI is now ready for next week\u2019s executive. We will probably set the debt ceiling from 1 to 3 million, so @Prose11, we can set the polls for that one for next week. There were some questions around staking ETH. The Protocol Engineering work on this one is done. We are targeting mid to end September, depending on the Oracle sprint that\u2019s going to come. We are starting to line up the next couple set of executives. There are conversations regarding a StETH-CRV Pool. We have conversations with Nik and Sam on using CropJoin to integrate with such a pool, so keep an eye out for that. Last week, we mentioned AAVE had completed a review. We created one outstanding PR, which we still want to merge. I am looking for a formal audit; I\u2019m looking for different entities to get that to happen. In terms of the forum, we had the Collateral Onboarding Risk Assessment, which Ryan completed on SolarX. We also had @Talbaneth post the DssCharter today, in support of institutional vaults. There\u2019s been lots of good conversation about fixed-rate solutions. We will take some time in the next few weeks to review all these alternative options. On the Layer 2 side, we did a high-level review with the team on Arbitrum. The Arbitrum team confirmed they are planning to launch next week. However, they are planning to have an audit completed slightly after their launch date. We have some reviews to do on our side, and as part of our deep dive, we will be putting forth a document about the risk trade-off, the options, alternatives, and our role in it with the DAI bridge. There hasn\u2019t been much focus on Optimism because we\u2019ve been focused on Arbitrum. On Monday, there was a mention that the PAX token name will be changing from PAX-USD to USDP, so there\u2019ll be some work for us to update that. However, I think the PAX PSM will remain unless we create a whole new type of statistic.   Discussion  Q: Is it still viable for the team to work on the Optimism because protocols like HOP are coming into the picture? A: We are talking to Chris from HOP; Chris on the L2 Team and Sam were having a conversation about engagement with their platform and the cross-chain transfers on the platform. A: Hop Protocol is going to introduce DAI support, but their solution is not perfect. They have various capital constraints. They need different actors in the system to work properly. It will be much more expensive for end-users to move their DAI between chains. With Maker, we can make it very cheap, with infinite liquidity. Secondly, having to stack allows us to do advanced actions, including Maker deployments between other chains. It\u2019s great that these protocols exist, but HOP requires over 300% collateralization ratio for 1 DAI, whereas Maker does not require that.   Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 21:04  Last week, we delivered the MATIC oracle, and the Executive has passed since then. A new sprint began yesterday. The primary goal for that sprint is Staked ETH (StETH) onboarding with our pricing tools, Gopher and Setzer. Hopefully, we have a release candidate fairly soon. StETH-ETH Balancer pool is now available. Lido is giving liquidity mining rewards, in addition to the ones on Curve. That is good news because there would be two prices sources to query from, instead of only one, eliminating one of our risk factors leading to our initial avoidance from the feed-based oracle approach for Staked ETH. Adding Staked ETH to ETH (StETH-ETH) LP Token in Curve  In its brainstorming phase. Integration with the CropJoin adapter. Originally, CropJoin started farming the UNI rewards on UNISwap, but those ended. Then, we planned to use CropJoin for the SUSHI rewards on SushiSwap, but they were upgrading too fast. Now, we hope to use CropJoin for the Lido rewards and potentially Curve rewards as well. You get the StETH yield, the Curve trading yield, and the Lido token yield. One of the issues is that we don\u2019t get the Curve boosting, but the Curve yield is very minimal compared to the Lido yield and the staking yield. It does not play a major role; it\u2019s 0.25% to 0.35%, so you are only losing 0.10% or so. Project is at an early stage; there are no obvious blockers, the Oracle piece is still up in the air. Curve has a flash loan proof function that lets you query the price of an LP token. If that\u2019s the case, it should be straightforward but requires further investigation.   In conclusion, we\u2019ve had some discussions about the Oracle Core Unit regarding product expansion and new products we want to do. Primary focus for the next couple of months is to get on other L1s and L2s. Nothing is blocking this, and it\u2019s a matter of committing resources. We are looking at chains like Optimism, StarkWare, and we want to be on Arbitrum. We want to be on some of the L1s like Solana and AVAX. The chains that are EVM-compatible will be much easier for us to do. Non-EVM compatible chains like Solana will require some type of short-term contracting or speak with the teams to discuss using their resources and support our oracle contracts. There is a potential for collaboration there. That\u2019s it in terms of the expansion of oracles themselves. In terms of bridges, we were tasked with the Optimism fast DAI withdrawal bridge. There needs to be an oracle to work, but the mechanism is about the same for every chain. You\u2019re utilizing the consensus mechanism that you have for the oracles but now using the consensus to say, \u201cDid you see a transaction on the source chain? Oh, yeah, great, send a verification or signature on the destination chain.\u201d This will be great because you can have routers or message handlers on every chain. You create a standard, then have these message handlers on every chain. Rather than specifically creating a bridge, such as from ETH to Optimism, you can create a bridge from ETH to anywhere else that supports this standard. Conceivably, you can have Solana send messages to Avalance, not just ETH to that or ETH, but across chains. That\u2019s very preliminary, and we are starting to hash out the details, and it looks like we will be in a cross-chain kind of world. Bridges are going to be a great product in the future. The economics of the bridges would be better than price oracles. With price oracles, you have to run them continuously and keep pushing prices, whether or not anyone is using them. With Bridges, as long as you run a margin on top of the transaction cost, it\u2019s a guaranteed profit instead of price oracles, which require more care and higher risk.   Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 29:40   Maker Vault Debt Liquidation Protection Metrics - Analysis of the number of users and the debt protected against liquidations with various protection protocols. We are planning to automate these metrics, assign users a risk score. With the tools developed, we\u2019ll track vault protection, DAI utilization activity, and the assignment of risk scores. Finalized terms and parameters for a 100 million Polygon treasury loan. The terms are similar for the next institutional Vault: origination fee, collateral ratio maintenance requirements, and fixed rate. It has more conservative risk parameters, MATIC is far less liquid than ETH or Bitcoin. We will see if they agree to proceed forward. Potential framework for this institutional or treasure-type offerings because the process is currently ad-hoc, and standardization is needed. Progress on NEXO institutional vault risk assessment. Awaiting feedback on initial parameters, but recent analysis shows that parameters are not in Maker\u2019s favor. A signal poll is being prepared to address this. Finally, exact parameters changes and timeframe will be posted for offboarding KNC type vault as well as offboarding other collaterals.   Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 34:07  The big thing you just saw is that the 6S executive has passed. I expressed this in the posts, but  Matthew, maybe you want to speak briefly about it and give us some perspective of what we can expect soon. Matthew Rabinowitz: With the deepest humility and on behalf of the entire S Capital Team, I would like to take a moment and express gratitude for those that voted in favor of the 6S and granted the debt ceiling and for those that voted the entire proposal and countless stakeholders along the way. It has been a long haul. A special shout out here to Greg and RWA Company and all the Maker representatives, specifically Martin. He has been behind the scenes and spent countless hours with Legal Compliance for the Cayman structure, to which it would not have been possible without. I cannot also forget those that helped along the way and the encouragement and support everybody gave. Thank you so much. Since some of these discussions started back in the first half of 2019, the Senior Secured structure represents a huge milestone not only for 6S but the DAO as a whole. We are just thrilled to be able to do this milestone together. We are committed on this end to always be an ever-present community member and a steward as one of those that will choose to pay it forward. As a community, we build this entire ecosystem. 6S Team is humbled by the community\u2019s trust in our hands, even if it is not known as more political and reputational. We will work tirelessly to ensure the judgment to allocate that trust and that risk of capital are never questioned, but relationships matter. I closed with gratitude and Optimism, which started down a path of tapping into the existing credit system with a secured structure, and we did it together. We have only scratched the surface of what we can accomplish with the Delaware Statutory Trust. The journey on this is only beginning. As far as the next steps, we will be doing as small of a test transaction as we can. We are moving a small amount of money as we can, probably by the end of next week, to send it to the Trust structure and send it back. Then document every single step along the way, document all the money that moved whether or not it is an Ethereum transaction ETH or with the bank itself, the Trust account itself so that we can put together a report so the community can feel comfortable that the entire circuit is well established. Completely the crawl walk run model. As far as when we will be able to use this structure, as any Senior Lender will tell you, you cannot rely on a structure until you have it, and until we had it, we did not have it. There is going to be a lead time off. Now we have a structure in place, still in my head until we test this circuit, it is not battle-tested, and until it is battle-tested, I would not rely on it, and I would not rely on it for the DAO\u2019s money. It might be five to six weeks before we can route our first deal to it; I hope it\u2019s last. Crawl, walk, run, but for now, it probably needs a vacation.  We have published a Risk Assessment of SolarX. Thanks to Christian. As a Gouvernance Poll, it is expected on Monday so that everyone can vote next week. On the finance side of the Risk Assessment, Mark has published the financial analysis of the institutional Vault. We are losing an opportunity to make a lot of money if we do it, but there might be some strategic reason. I will let you see the details, and there will be a tool for the community to voice their opinion. We have had some discussions inside the team about what decentralization is and what decentralization means because we are using the word a lot. Actually, when you go into detail, we do not know what the word means because there are so many things that can be meant as decentralized or not. For instance, in my view, if MakerDAO makes a decision is decentralized because MakerDAO is decentralized, but for other people, if MakerDAO makes a decision, it is centralized because MakerDAO did make a decision. It is always decentralized and centralized on what scale, and there are many dimensions to assess. We are looking to expand the team significantly on many forms because we are trying to add that now that we have many RWA staff on MakerDAO, we can reach new people and people working in finance and not in crypto. Before, people in finance were not super interested in joining a crypto project, especially one that did not have any RWA. We have opened a partnership with GST Capital. The thing we get from these partnerships is for me to pick the brain of RAI, which is knowledgeable in securitization, which is more than enough for me.   Lucas will join to work on an audit on Fortunafi. He is not able to join full-time, but he will work on it a little bit. Again, he is super knowledgeable on securitization; he worked in London for Hedge Fund for many years and is excited to do some securitization. Many people know a lot about securitization in the firm currently, and that is since we are looking for people to join. There is still one full-time position to be onboard, which should be done soon because we have some candidates.   Questions  You mentioned that audit for Fortunafi, and I know we have some other Centrifuge people on the call here. I wondered if we have any timeline on when we might utilize the recently approved centrifuge facilities. I think we have three new drop Vaults that still have not been used yet.  On ConsoleFreight, this will take a little time because we are doing some other stuff as well, many changes of the middleware, so it is better. For Fortunafi, we are doing a deal with a Vipe that will drive most of the flow, but we are speaking with Vipe for about two months; it was delayed opening the polls, so that it will take a bit of time.   Lucas: Now that they are in place, there is a lot of prep work to do to start using them, which should come soon. This will happen as fast as these asset originators have assets that they believe are good and should be financed. We do not want to rush because that would mean the DAI would take the wrong kind of assets, and none of us would like that.   Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 43:38 Growth CU weekly update  We are in conversations with Bankless DAO to see how we can work together with them. We will help them to create a proposal which we have just started working on. They will help a lot with the protocol in spreading the message. Also, they will help us find out what message we want to communicate mainly to the crypto world, which I think we have a debt with. The idea is to use these Bankless DAO for different things like creating alphas, posting Twitter, have a crypto Twitter army, sheet posting, memes, and that kind of things but around a message. This is what is powerful. We all saw what they did with ETH\u2019s money, so we want to show the community that Maker has been there, Maker is still there, and we continuously create new things. We are one of the first big protocols which are completely decentralized, and we are working as a real DAO without a foundation in the middle, and no one is talking about that, so we want to start using this BanklessDAO to talk about this and communicate it. It will be a nice experiment, and it will be like things will be in the future where we will see a lot of DAO\u2019s working with DAO\u2019s and providing services between DAO\u2019s. We are also maintaining conversations with the projects that we thought we should offboard because of the utilization. We talked with Blueprints and discovered that they are using the Vault. Probably they are the only user of the Vault. They are working with a product called ETHPort that will help the composability between layer two and layer one. When they launch it, that will be during Q4. LRC holders, ETH USDC, and WBTC holders will be able to, through Loopring to open a Maker Port using that composability between layer two and layer one. We are making suggestions to the community; we should onboard them because they create an interesting use-case so LRC holders will want to use Maker Vaults when they release this product. With the Voting delegation that LongForWisdom mentioned last week, we started working closely with the UX Team to help them talk with the main custodial solutions to integrate the Voting Delegation System. This is great for both of the teams. We are helping them with all the admin tasks of convincing someone to integrate something, and for us, it is another conversation point to have with these custodial solutions. In the updates you will find in the forum, I did not include what we are doing with the institutional Vaults. We are in conversations with Polygon. Tomorrow I will review the terms that the Risk Team created. The idea is, in case they accepted, to convince them to use part of the loan, they will ask to deploy that Dai in Polygon. We want to use that Dai to increase Dai adoption between the deployed projects in Polygons. We will have that conversation tomorrow, and I will share the updates next week. As Primoz and S\u00e9bastien mentioned, we are working on a signal request. After reviewing the answers we got from the community regarding the financial analysis Mark did for the institutional Vaults, we will present different options for this Nexo institutional Vault to the community. One of the options will be to wait for one of these fixed-term solutions that we saw in the forum. But we think that an institutional Vault is different from a long-term Vault. Derek posted about this in the forum, and we think that institutional Vaults will be something that we will do just for some institutions like those that will bring a lot of Dai into the market and institutions that understand and manage in a very safe way their Vaults. We see the long-term Vaults or these fixed-term solutions as a fixed-term solution for everyone who wants to open up a Vault and have access to these terms. It is a good first step towards having these kinds of solutions and these solutions that others are creating Aave with Aave ARC and compound with the institutional solution. We are going to present the signal request to the community and see how it goes. The start of the week! An international exchange that is going to integrate Dai will happen next week. In the Tweet of the week, we talk about how the Maker community decides to include new Collaterals into the system.

Wintermute is market-neutral across bid-ask and reduces risk impacts. Can provide great inventory and pricing for trade execution on MKR. Ask for a protective MKR call option attached to loan amounts. Have a strong OTC market, which can be useful for RWA deals. UK regulated entity, which will require complete KYC for onboarding assets. Have large amounts traded on many DEXs. Committed to a specific spread across all the exchanges and pairs that MKR and DAI token is traded on. The algorithms work 24/7, supported by experienced traders, and we do not charge fees.   Nadia: A market maker will help with low-liquidity tokens.

Today I invited Jonathan Chan from Wintermute. I have been talking with him because when we were at the foundation, we worked with different neutral market makers to increase volume in different markets of MKR and Dai. Now that the foundation is gone, this is an important discussion that we should have inside the community to understand first if we want to do it and why we should or should not do it. I do not have the answers for that. I have been thinking about it; I have been reviewing the MKR token in different markets. The volume is not the optimal volume that it should have. It could be a problem, for example, if the bonus is vested for all the Core Units and if someone wants to sell their MKR, I hope they are not, but you never know; that could be an issue. It is important to discuss this topic and between everyone understand what we should do. If we decide that this is something that the DAO should do, the next step will be to think about how we will manage that. Usually, how market makers work is we give them a loan of MKR or Dai so they can do this neutral market-making in different markets. We can help them decide which markets we want them to be more focused on and listen to their suggestions. Although Wintermute could be one, I chose them because they are the most important market maker for crypto. The idea will be to open this opportunity to all other market makers interested in working with us. If we decide that we want this, we should consider a new type of proposal to give these types of loans and understand their conditions to help us with this.   Wintermute: Jonathan Chan 12:44  Hello to everyone. I am Jonathan Chan. I work at Wintermute. I also have Yuri, our head of DeFi, joining us in the call. Thank you very much for having us. It is quite an honor to be on the call. I could give you a brief introduction about Wintermute and what we do if some members have not heard about it. The core of the business is a trading firm in a market-neutral capacity. Currently, we are trading across 60 different venues. This is across CeFi and DeFi. We are very good at trading a lot of assets across centralized exchanges. The shine and allure of Wintermute is the fact that we trade a very good amount on decentralized exchanges. Probably a vast majority of Ethereum chain volumes flow through our vaults. That is the one thing that we could help out with. As Nadia said, we can never guarantee values or movements or the price appreciation of any asset we trade. We are market neutral, where we layer our quotes equally on both sides across the bid and the ask. We reduce those price impacts on the way up and on the way down. Because Wintermute is very DeFi focused, we can trade across centralized and decentralized exchanges very efficiently. This means for your users that we can generate more fees and more rewards on the dexes. Because Wintermute trades a significant amount on centralized exchanges, we will provide more liquidity for users on those platforms. On top of that, we have a robust OTC desk. At this point, whether that is via manual telegram chat or over the phone, but also through our VR API. If we were to add a sufficient inventory to our trading vaults, we could ping the counterparties that we trade with that we can provide a good amount of inventory and very good Vest, very good pricing on the trade execution Maker. Those are some of the aspects that Wintermute does as a whole. Trading is very vanilla. But the allure of Wintermute is the work that we do on the DeFi side. Generally, our upper rate is on a loan basis where Wintermute asks for a certain amount of a loan, and we fund the complete another side of that loan. The ETHUSDT, USDC the BTC, on Coinbase, EUR GBP, we are the only market maker that funds that side of the currency league. There are no fees associated with us, but we ask for a call option attached to that loan amount. The call option is to protect us and hopefully reap the benefits of the project\u2019s success, but we are market neutral. I want to emphasize that we cannot control the price movements on each asset that we trade. We have standardized our commercials on the projects we have partnered with, but this case is more strategic. It is a reputation where we want to build and help Maker out, so we have moved our commercials completely to the other end where we just want to work together. We want to propose that the community vote as we want to be flexible to work with and promote the project.   Questions 16:51 - Nadia Alvarez  What you mentioned, Jonathan, about the OTC is super interesting. I do not know if Seb is here; that will be super useful for all the real-world asset deals in the pipeline.  Jonathan Chan: For every project that we partner with, we offer our OTC desk as a service for free in a capacity where we need to fully KYC and onboard the individuals or entities that we trade with because we are U.K. regulated and we are a fully regulated entity. After that, whether you want to buy or sell, that is confidential information that we keep to Wintermute, can if they are looking to buy, provide those counterparties with very good pricing. If we do not have enough inventory and we do not trade the asset, we cannot do that, and technically, most likely, they would not buy because it is poor pricing. On the flip side, if they are looking to sell to take some of their gains, we can provide a very good price to protect the coin price and reduce slippage. Because we have inventory and can hedge out that risk across all the venues that we trade on. That is via the manual process, but also OTC, we group it. Together we can stream Maker through the institutional counterparties that we trade with, and their internal trading desks or their clients can use their discretion and how to trade it. If they do not have inventory, they generally go one way.    18:34  David Utrobin: Will Wintermute be participating or barring itself from participation in Maker governance with the lent MKR?  Jonathan Chan: This is strictly for liquidity provisions, and we do not yield farms with this. We want to be very clear that this is only to help the liquidity provisions of Maker\u2014nothing else.    19:03  Nadia Alvarez: Andrew, if you are here, I know you were always worried about MKR price and low volume, seeing the exchanges, etc. Maybe you can jump into the conversation.  Andrew Burban: I know that we have been rather illiquid for a while. One person\u2019s selling knocks the price down; one person\u2019s buying knocks the price up. Greg floated some ideas of having a market maker. He did not necessarily mention Wintermute but some other players that I have mixed feelings about their ethics. I do not think I have ever heard anything too negative about Wintermute, so I would be more than happy to see Wintermute be our market maker. Jonathan Chan: I want to be clear again that we are market neutral trading firm. If our quotes get hit on the buy-side, we are doing vice-versa to hedge out our risks somewhere else to what our algorithms and the marketing conditions are at that point. I have been asked this many times; we cannot influence the price of the coin.    20:21  Andrew Burban: I do not think that Wintermute should be pushing the price one way or the other, and I think you would mute the market movements.  Jonathan Chan: That is correct. The good thing about your coin is that it already trades on a decent amount of venues. Not specifically for Maker but for some other assets that we partner with, we try to help those tokens get listed on other centralized exchanges. This is not necessarily the case for Maker because it\u2019s already listed on many venues. Because we have access and are integrated with so many different venues across CeFi and DeFi, we can reduce that impact if there is one large seller or buyer on one venue and aid in price discovery across all the different venues that we trade on. I am not saying anything bad about any other market-making firm or trading firm; they are all good in their respect. One big thing about Wintermute is that it is really good on DEXs. We trade a very large volume on all the decentralized exchanges, so we can aid in price discovery and generate rewards for your users on those platforms.   Andrew Burban: Having a more liquid market is important.  21:56  Nadia Alvarez: Answering Nicolas\u2019 question. Yes, when we talk about an exchange, it is important to have a market maker helping us. It is the same situation as we are now having with the collaterals. If we have collateral that is not profitable, we want to offboard that collateral. It is something similar happening with exchanges. They are looking for listing pairs that are profitable for them. If they have a low liquidity token in their exchange, it is hard to maintain that one. That is why when we talk with exchanges, we have to commit to providing them a market-making service or work with their market makers. When we were at the foundation, we used to do that in-house with LPL. Now we do not have LPL, and we do not have a foundation. It is important to have other participants in the DAO doing that. Wintermute could be one. After that, we could start working with others.  23:23  David Utrobin: Is the goal to start market making on new markets where we want Dai to start to get a mode? Or is the idea also to market make on existing markets for more depth? I am curious about the sizing of these activities. How much MKR and Dai is a recommendable amount to give per market maker?  Jonathan Chan: This, at first, would be for Maker. I have Yuri on the call which is our head of DeFi. We have been working with Dai for a couple of years now. Yuri could get to some technical aspects that, even behind the scene, we were doing to help promote it before this call has happened. With our market-making agreements, we have standardized it to a certain amount. I do not want to say it is a specific equation, but market cap volumes and venues traded are given because we need sufficient supply. If the treasury can only give us five million dollars equivalent worth of Maker, it will not impact. If someone on our OTC desk, an institution on our OTC desk, asks for ten million dollars worth of trade, we will not be able to facilitate that trade for them. On top of being able to layer all the quotes and the different venues that we trade on. A sufficient supply is A: we need to do our jobs properly. Then to touch base on the call option, we ask for around 10 or 20 percent, a higher price than when we receive assets. In this case, we are very willing to work with the team and go a hundred percent above asset price when we get Maker\u2019s delivery. I do not think we have ever done this before; this is more strategic sense. We want to work with you.    25:32  Planet_X: What is the target amount that you are asking for or the target liquidity? Sometimes you have coins with little liquidity, and it can be argued that some coins have too much liquidity. There is a sweet spot somewhere, and you probably made those calculations already.  Jonathan Chan: I do not know if a coin can have too much liquidity. There are advantageous for your users to have a lot of liquidity. When they enter a trade, whether it is in or out, they are more confident of getting the price that they would get. I tend to disagree on having too much liquidity, especially in cryptos. To go back on how we standardized our market-making agreements, generally, we ask for around one to two percent of total supply, and the call option is pegged to around ten to twenty percent higher value when we receive assets. In this case, we could go for a lower loan amount, and as I mentioned before, we want to work with you guys, so we are going for a hundred percent higher for the call option premium than when we receive assets. We have never done that before, but this is a different case where we are willing to work to make something happen.    27:25  MakerMan: Are you talking target liquidity of ten to twenty thousand Maker with a hundred percent upside price option?  Jonathan Chan: That is correct. Ten to twenty is probably higher than what I was looking for. Initially, when I spoke to Nadia, we were looking at around seventy-five hundred.   MakerMan: You say that having lots of liquidity is good. With governance, with Maker, you have to realize that a certain amount of Maker can come and float an executive. There is an inherent concern that too much liquidity groups into the market, which can happen too quickly. You KYC your clients, and we know who that is in principle. It was why I asked the question. Thank you for the answer, by the way. What is the downside to that? I mean, someone is going to buy, so you want an option from us at a hundred upside risk. But what if somebody wants to sell twenty thousand like a16z. Are you going to take that buy, or are you going to float it back to us?  Jonathan Chan: This is all principal capacity. What that means is that we are taking that risk. If a large holder maker wants to sell via our OTC desk, we will give them a price. Theoretically speaking, because we have sufficient inventory, we give them a pretty good price. Then we hold on to that risk, and then we hedge out that sell-order across all the venues or algorithms, say at that point or whatever time frame that it needs to be hedged out in. That is our risk. We do not pass it back out to you.   MakerMan: Let me follow up on that. Are you saying that you are going to take the cash downside and hedge it out? But you want to have an option for the hundred percent upside if you need to source liquidity? Is that the deal?  Jonathan Chan: No. The call option is only European style. It is only exercisable after twelve months. Theoretically speaking, let\u2019s say the price was 22.50 when I last looked, so call it 4500 is the exercisable call option that Wintermute has after twelve months. We would be able to purchase the loan amounts at 4500 dollars per token. Although that being said, because we are a market-neutral trading firm, we would rather continue the relationship by rolling this loan at a higher call strike if it were there because we do not want to be exposed to the price movement of your coin. If we were to own and not borrow a coin, the price goes down; we lose money, the price goes up. We make money. We do not want that at all. We want to make money by trading the coin. Price agnostic is the business of Wintermute.   MakerMan: What are you asking us is for that call option to hedge your risk?  Jonathan Chan: Yes! It is to capture the upside, and we need the loan to trade. In any asset that we trade, we do not go out in the open market and purchase it, and we do not want to be exposed to the price movement of any coin that we trade.   MakerMan: How does Maker make money off this?  Jonathan Chan: It is a Domino effect. There is not. I am not trying to sell you anything. It is a liquidity provision service that we provide and also our OTC desk as well. Your users can have a sense of confidence that they can execute their pricing, whether it is a buy or sell order at a certain level. Once we add the asset that we have sufficient inventory to our OTC desk, our institutional OTC counterparties that we trade with can be confident that they could trade through us. I do not know how Maker makes money on that. It is for the general health of Maker and to have more exposure to the users.    31:52  LongForWisdom: You mentioned a few times that you were excited to work with Maker and that it was going past what you would usually do. Why are you excited to work with Maker as opposed to other firms?  Jonathan Chan: Maker is such a big name, and I will pass this on to Yuri and some of the technical side that we have already done with Maker and Dai.    32:21  Yuri: Hello to everyone. It is a good question about why we want to work with Maker? We are one of the few market makers in the space with a DeFi team onboard, and Maker is a protocol that has been alive in DeFi for a very long time. It is probably one of the biggest and one of the most trusted protocols out there. On top of that, we have been working with Dai and trading Dai and Maker for a very long time now, over two years. At this point, it is for us something that we would love to do rather than a business deal that we get from any other project.  33:32  Primoz: Is this loan uncollateralized? I assume it has zero interest?  Yuri: Yes, it is an uncollateralized loan and zero interest.    33:50  Nadia Alvarez: It is important to understand that they are providing a service to the DAO, and they need the capital to start deploying that capital in different exchanges, centralized and decentralized. They are going to earn something doing this with the call option after twelve months.   Conclusion 34:20  Jonathan Chan: There is a time constraint on everyone. I will drop my telegram handle and e-mail if you want to ask me any questions. I will be happy to jump on another call and to assist and walk through the process. I understand it is something relatively new. We do have a decent amount of relationships and partnerships with other DAOs in the market-making capacity. You do not need to take my word for it. I will shoot some here, and you will see how their relationship is with us and their experiences.   Self-Insurance Fund  SES: LayerZero 35:49  Good afternoon to everybody. We are working on an SES project about an important legal issue we have in SES. A special working group deals with legal and regulatory topics. We are working on several projects, and this is the first one that we want to share with the community. It is about the creation of a legal self-insurance fund for MakerDAO.   SES - LayerZero - Self Insurance Fund1920\u00d71137 201 KB   Presentation1920\u00d71112 118 KB   The Problem1920\u00d71109 167 KB   What risks can be covered for MakerDAO?1920\u00d71121 198 KB   Who will be covered?1920\u00d71064 99.4 KB   Questions1920\u00d71080 74.9 KB   Questions 43:20  MakerMan: Who insures on this kind of stuff? What do the insurance agreements would look like? Who would take the secondary side of this with a high deductible? What do those things look like?  LayerZero: Reinsurance companies can take the excess of loss. Regarding the structure, there are specialized legal advisors in the insurance industry that help structure these funds. We should hire one of these. When we decide what our priorities are, the next step is to go to one of these law offices specializing in insurance and structuring these funds. The first step is to structure the fund, get a quote and say how large the fund is and how much it costs to structure it. Then we can find in the reinsurance market how to cover the rest of the risk. The first layer is to cover this first part. MakerMan: Seems reasonable. Thanks for bringing this up, and it will lead to some interesting discussions.    44:41  LongForWisdom: Is self-insurance not that we keep a pool of money to pay for these things? Are there insurance providers involved?  LayerZero: It will work like a deductible. Deductibles are a way of self-insurance. You take the risk up to a certain amount, and the insurance covers the excess of this amount. It will be something similar. We set aside, pay for this first layer of risk, and look for products in the insurance market that can help us transfer the rest of the risk. There is a way of transferring the rest of the risk. We have to deal with it now that we are in a vulnerable position. If somebody sues somebody in the Maker ecosystem or a regulator investigates somebody, we have the risk of legal costs and damages, and fines. These risks are not covered yet, but it is possible to do so. The first condition is to have one of these self-insurance funds schemes ready.    45:50  MakerMan: Are you implying that we need to have a fund with the capital inside it, or a Vault can draw against that amount?  LayerZero: Both could work. We do not know in which frequency they will come. Maybe it will be enough if we can get funds if there is a large case. That is something we have to decide. What would be the best structure to do it if we use this special purpose fund? Who will manage the multi-sig? There are many questions. Suppose we need a trust or some type of legal structure to handle this situation in the legal world. In our case, I do not know yet. First, we have to decide on the scope and the coverage and then see how we can restructure it.    47:00  LongForWisdom: One of the things you were introducing before was settlements and paying out\u2014the kind of results of these little cases. I do not know the technology. Do you worry that will increase the risk? If there is big money that is there to pay for trust payings. If we are successfully sued, do you think that will increase people\u2019s frequency or likelihood of suing?  LayerZero: I see this risk. In the traditional world, you would keep all of these things very confidential. We have to wait. Transparency is in the DNA of Maker. On the other hand, we do not have to publish all the details publicly. We should be cognizant about what part of this question should be held publicly. If we promote and publicly know that we have an \u201cX\u201d million fund, it could eventually go against us. I would keep details more confidential about the amounts and the coverage or assign permissions only for DAO members. LongForWisdom: The first idea is great. This will fund legal defense, making it less likely that people will sue someone because there has been a massive fund that will protect them. Maybe the sentiment part is something that, if possible it should be left less explicit. LayerZero: Yes. That is a good idea.    49:03  Nathan Vandy: It\u2019s great to join my first governance call. I work for a non-profit organization in Belgium where we support DAO with law and governance on operational and policy levels. As part of this fund, have you looked at the assessment of whether it will be good to look at the individual jurisdictions on a corporate law level and see which members of MakerDAO are currently exposed and see if there could be some sort of education with the legislators about why certain members of an open protocol should not be held liable in any issues. For example, developers of open-source protocols do not have any liability in most jurisdictions unless they act out of bad faith and create bad code. The same can be applied for contributors in open source protocols such as MakerDAO, which provides services for this open post-call that anyone can join. Was a portion of the self-insurance fund set aside to examine whether the measure was less reactive and more proactive?  LayerZero: Yes, that is thinkable. We can structure it tailor-made to what we need, and developers are more exposed in a DAO than in a company context. The DAO does not exist as a legal entity, and somebody has to be the official provider of a service that appears in the terms and conditions. Sometimes that needs to be the developer or the company of a developer. There is a higher exposure to risk, and that could be thinkable. That is not only reactive but also proactive. We could implement that. LongForWisdom: It sounds like something worth looking into, and I did not think I heard that point of view on any of the legal stuff before.    52:06  PaperImperium: I have seen the idea that personal risk is something we compensate people more highly for in the DAO. Would this fund take away that premium? Is that something that contributors want? Personally, if I were a contributor, I would rather have increased compensation, so I feel confident that I do not have to petition the DAO to rescue me if something goes wrong.  LayerZero: We could stack it that way. If somebody has to pay for legal defense, we can use this fund to refund that payment. You do not have to ask somebody in the DAO to defend or pay, and you have to pay upfront and solicit reimbursement for the legal costs. Is that what you mean? PaperImperium: There is always a choice for somebody for the DAO to decide not to reimburse you or not to defend you out of this fund. If you have a higher income baked into your salary, is it possible to do it that way? What are the trade-offs? There must be some premium baked into salaries where you are compensating that risk right now. LayerZero: In some form, yes. Probably a compensation in MKR above the market average, and they include some type of risk premium. I agree with that. On the other hand, personal liability risk is the most important legal risk at the DAO. That could ruin somebody. We need not only to protect our labor force but also to attract new talent. Suppose you have a solid risks management framework for limiting this liability risk. The damages could be huge and ruin a business or a person. The salaries premium that we may have at Maker does not compensate for all the hidden liability risks that could arise. If something goes wrong in the protocol, whom would they go after if there is no foundation? They will go after somebody that they can sue, and that is publicly identifiable. Theoretically, with no legal entity in many world jurisdictions, the default entities are a general partnership. This implies that anybody could be held liable for the whole liabilities of the project. That is more like a theoretical risk, but it can happen. Maybe the legislation that we have is not advanced enough to generate on the legal side, on the law, more liability protection for the workers of DAO. DAO is very new. We must have something until we have new legislation. I think this will come, and there are some frameworks in Wyoming, in DAO limited liability companies, limited liability wrappers for DAO, etc. We are investigating at SES some of these hybrid organizational models. Those are experimental topics. We need something practical that we could implement in the next three to six months. This is something practical, and that has been used in the legacy world. PaperImperium: From a practical perspective, the program\u2019s funding should be done through people paying for it. You mentioned that the employees pay into these insurance pools. LayerZero: We can consider that.    56:14  David Utrobin: When an employee leaves, do they get their contributions back? What is the standard for this kind of thing? This is the first that I have never heard of.  PaperImperium: No one can claw back insurance premiums.    56:32  S\u00e9bastien: Why do we need a fund? What happens if today someone is suing anyone from MakerDAO? If someone, like SEC or someone else, sues someone from the DAO, at which point would we decide not to help this person?  LayerZero: We have to be compliant. We have a large exposure to real-world finance, and they can get us to many places. Not acting is not viable. Not only for the person involved but for the project itself because we want to go and serve the economy of the real world. We have to be very careful with what happens with the actions of regulators. S\u00e9bastien: Does this fund is in the real world, and all the members of the DAO will have a contract with this fund to be sure that they are reimbursed at some point? Someone: We need some type of legal agreement or trust or structure. S\u00e9bastien: It\u2019s on-chain. LayerZero: Yes, it has a part of the chain. We have to pay the lawyers, and somebody has to decide a rule for managing the claims. There are many implementation issues, and we need some type of structure in the real world. LongForWisdom: That does not help people anon for legal defense if they need to have signed a contract in advance.    58:58  LayerZero: There is a second-order effect. It may impact salaries, not by having people pay out of their salaries, but by creating competitive pressure as the risk perception of working for the DAO. If that improves, one would assume that more new joiners would be willing to work for more market-competitive rates. That should be the mechanism that we aim for. Taking it from people\u2019s compensation is not a good idea.  59:52  Nathan Vandy: To follow up on that. With these situations, leaving one individual exposed is not ideal, especially when working in open-source spaces where you are collaboratively trying to build something together. That creates the attitude of every man for himself. This whole industry is about the exact opposite. Further, when it comes to liability issues that cover working in a DAO, we did coverage on organizations such as MakerDAO. Under the majority of jurisdictions, they are going to be considered as unincorporated joint partnerships. That means that it is not an individual that will be taken on just their risk. An individual might be taken on the whole risk for multiple parties, and that is the main issue as well on top of the attitude and orientation needed regarding this. A few options that might need to be considered. It sounds like there have already been certain steps taken forward, such as having limited liability companies when working with the DAO so that the individual personal assets are protected, and it is just the company\u2019s assets that can be protected. Maybe some more investigation needs to happen in this direction for the members to understand those risks more clearly and get more education.  1:02:37  Wouter: In our incubation program, we are working with the different teams explaining the liability risks and encouraging people to incorporate and have a limited liability shield in case something happens. There are some education efforts on that front going on, and they should be expanded and improved.  1:03:34  MakerMan: Are you suggesting everybody that works with Maker to have their limited liability, at least in the U.S., an LLC?  LayerZero: We are suggesting for incubus that incorporated legal entities is one of the ways of limiting liability risk is not for everybody, but it is one of the main purposes of incorporating. The legal entity should be more at the periphery at the DAO and then more at the center. It limits to a certain extent the liability risk, but that it is not enough. Suppose an important C.U. is a lawsuit target and goes insolvent because it has to pay huge damages that could not be a problem for the C.U. That could be a problem for the protocol itself. That covers part of the risk. We have to analyze which part is already covered at a C.U. or an individual level and what risk is left out. Use this self-insurance fund to cover the risk that right now is not covered.    1:04:50  MakerMan: The painful jurisdiction is maybe the U.S. You could have the protocol engineering break into a unit that is U.S.-based and non-U.S. based. If one part of the C.U. comes under attack, the other core part of the C.U. can still operate. It is something to think about how we continue to operate if some unit comes into trouble in a jurisdiction.  LayerZero: Exactly. Redundancy and parallel work is part of the strategy. If a Unit gets impacted and is involved in some legal trouble, we have to isolate the risk and not spread it through the DAO. One way to do it is having parallel teams working on the same topic. MakerMan: This is information that we would like to keep private. We want our workers to work through encrypted connections via VPNs. You start putting barriers between any element of trackability. Certain people at the front on this publicly do not do that, but it brings me back to that model, back in the old days when bitcoin was considered the dark web. Smart people were putting up barriers between them being found, starting with Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever that person was. The old days of crypto.    1:07:12  Nathan Vandy: It is a very slow process getting legal clarity regarding a lot of these matters. Some lawyers and academics are involved in working alongside policymakers and regulators to attempt to do this. It is necessary to facilitate the clarity for people to move into the space without worrying about things that people in the traditional finance industry do not have to worry about.  LayerZero: Legislation has to evolve. That would be part of a different call, part of our advocacy and public policy efforts. It is someplace that we want to go, but it would exceed the scope of this call to discuss all of this.     Conclusion  LongForWisdom  Thank you, LayerZero, for your presentation earlier.

Need to find a balance between an attractive cash compensation but also MKR compensation. Currently have unhappy Delegates and need to approach more professional and qualified Delegates from outside. Need to move forward with this situation through step-by-step measures besides just signals. Need to create a clear list of qualifications, KPIs, and \u201cjob\u201d descriptions for Delegates.  Contrary opinion: Since the community picks their Delegates, qualifications for Delegates will naturally be selected and weeded out by MKR lenders and community voters.   Responsibilities should be documented for Delegate rolls because the Delegate role is not properly defined. Delegation could be an idea for a Governance outreach Core Unit. We may need to give Delegates a chance to find out what exactly their job is.  This is a unique situation that we cannot predict. Need to allow some time of exploration to help develop the overview of a Delegate role. Contrary opinion: this could become a huge mess that will be difficult to fix later. We need to clarify the essential responsibilities right now; what, when, why.   There\u2019s uncertainty in the level of legal risk associated with Delegates. Rune believes we are too focused on external issues and need to revert to the core of MakerDAO and delegation. We need to spend more time discussing value in the DAO and delegation in general before focusing on Delegate responsibilities.  After that, we can begin to layer additional responsibilities for delegation.   Delegation was initially proposed to promote more MKR to be used for voting in Governance.  It worked, but now with just two or three Delegates, you can pass an entire executive. Regarding Governance voting, we need to break down the problem, the goal, and the solution. We also need to look into MKR tokenomics; MKR whales have no incentive to vote in Governance. The time that a Delegate spends does not match the output that the Delegate can physically release.   GovAlpha has been in discussion with various VCs to incentivize them to delegate their MKR.  Issues they brought up: Not enough Delegates and no clear formal process. Another way VCs can do this is to bring in their Delegates to Maker, which may hinder communication and transparency.    ",

Rune Christensen  Delegates workforce, empowered with resources. Disconnect MKR holders and CoreUnits, particularly budgets. The voting situation is like voter apathy, and of course, delegates are away for voters to organize. I also think a significant factor and the personal element to it. Difference between voters and a full-time professional delegate. They achieve the same political and systemic clout that the facilitators and the CoreUnits have right now. Need to find a balance between an attractive cash compensation but also MKR compensation. Unhappy delegates are not sustainable. We need to approach more professional and qualified Delegates from outside. Need to move forward with this situation through step-by-step measures besides just signals. Need to create a clear list of qualifications, KPIs, and \u201cjob\u201d descriptions for Delegates.   Does anybody else have a perspective on the ownership? 18:49  Unknown speaker: My perspective is: if we\u2019re going to have higher delegate compensation, we need to have a clear list of what the delegates are responsible for and make sure that they are qualified to take that on because, as it stands, it\u2019s easier to be a delegate than a facilitator. If we have competence on par, I would expect the delegates to be full-time and add value in ways that are qualified for their professional experience. Today, you can be a well self-delegate to yourself. There is no clear way to see the qualifications. The last time this was discussed on the forum, delegates worked ten to 15 hours a week. Do we want to pay them the same as a facilitator that\u2019s working at least 40 hours?  LongForWisdom: It\u2019s difficult to hire delegates because there isn\u2019t a position you can hire for. It\u2019s a position that is elected by MKR holders directly as they move the MKR around. I hope that once we start paying these rates, the people who are fitting in the part-time and don\u2019t have good qualifications will gradually be replaced by the people that do. They\u2019re more attractive to Maker holders as targets for delegation because they have the skills and the level of commitment. I think it\u2019s less important to define a strict list of requirements or a strict schedule or expectation. Because Maker holders should manage that themselves, right? As more delegates come on, like the high-quality ones to shoot a cream or Maker.    21:09  Juan: My concern is that it\u2019s not clear what the delegates should be doing. It\u2019s even hard for MKR holders to decide. I think any delegate can jump in and correct me, but there\u2019s a huge work that the delegates are doing that could be potentially outsourced to a core unit that depends directly on the delegates, right? And this core unit will do what is, in the corporate world, it\u2019s called ML, which is monitoring, evaluation, evaluating, and learning. It\u2019s like an advisory core unit that could potentially talk to different core units, ask for reports, ask what they\u2019re doing with the budget, what they\u2019re doing with initiatives, and keep them accountable. I have been thinking about improving Governance; these workers are more neutral and work directly for the delegates to work more on steering the vision. According to the MKR holders, I\u2019m not so much into doing the quote-unquote, dirty work of actually changing the core units to make sure that the quality is there.  22:43  Katie: I think the issue that I have with this proposal is that the role of the delegate seems murky to me and I\u2019ve seen people say that they\u2019re the role of the delegate is to interface with external regulators. That\u2019s not something that I would expect of a delegate, and if it is part of their like responsibility, I think that should be documented. And then there should be KPIs and stuff for a role like that. I agree that the delegate should be paid, but my issue is that the role isn\u2019t defined at all; I think some of the components that people are talking about could easily be a core unit, for example, a government outreach coordinate. I think it could be beneficial.  23:55  Unknown: I agree with the points that Juan and Katie made. We need to take a step back and assess: why did we implement delegates first? To pass votes or have them act as executives going through every map, signal requests, and be an advisor and neutral party? And then, fully defined, what should be within like a DUX delegates responsibility? I think people like the work that Paper is doing. I think that\u2019s far above more than what a delegate is defined to do. And that would be a CU type role or hybrid type role related to the DVC. You mentioned Runes; I don\u2019t know if you want to talk about that or any ideas you had related to that. I just wanted to address this. People are bringing up the question, and then we don\u2019t know what delegates are for. I agree that we don\u2019t know. Paper Imperium has done things as a delegate that were kind of unexpected. The lobbying government agencies perhaps could or should be coordinated. I think we have a chicken and egg problem here that we don\u2019t know needs delegates just to get votes passed in a timely fashion. We don\u2019t know what other responsibilities delegates should have. I don\u2019t think we can know that until we give delegates a chance to find their job. Our organization is unique, and we don\u2019t know what delegates will find they can do, and we cannot predict it. We need to allow exploration to happen, give them a chance to develop, invent their job, and then document it later into core units. We should let that experiment happen.  Niklas Kunkel: I want to push against that. I think you should segregate roles, and some things should be CoreUnits and others up to delegates, and just letting this delegate thing expand into a vacuum and absorb a bunch of stuff, it\u2019s going to be hard to splice that out later. And I have this fear that that\u2019s just going to turn into a mess. I would rather do the exact kind of polar opposite and just clearly define what a delegate does and does not do.   LongForWisdom: If my code is delegating to them, and they\u2019re happy with doing these things, there\u2019s nothing you can do, right? You can try to convince Maker holders that it would be better in a career; that\u2019s the sort of path to which I think Joshua was looking at, where you pull stuff out of the delegates, like role, and then move into something more structured. If you start saying, okay, delegates can\u2019t do this, but we also don\u2019t have anybody else to do it right now, then they\u2019re just going to do what they think is important.  Brian McMichael: The simple solution is to invest more money in them. Paper Imperium put up a poll to request some funds for legal representation. By being recognized delegate, you\u2019re putting your name out there, you\u2019re not an anon, and you do become the target. We were in a gray area here; it almost seems like we should be asking the delegates why they\u2019re not doing this and what we can do to make them feel comfortable in the role. I think that without legal protection guarantees from the DAO to delegates, it might just be too risky for anybody at any number.   Unknown speaker: Looking at like some of the bigger DAOs like Luca Uniswap, they have delegates from all like the major top universities in the US, including Harvard Law School, and just taking a step back even further, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s practical for the government to go after every single DAO at once in the US, and, we\u2019re a larger protocol. Still, we\u2019re not to the extent that Uniswap is even without a civil investigation going on. They\u2019re still acting as delegates.  30:20  Niklas Kunkel: Where does the idea that delegates are somehow more exposed to legal risks than other members of the DAO come from? Is there anything in common law that would point to that? Paper: The big fear is that anybody in the US that is looking to either file a claim against, say they think they are wrong by the DAO or think to some criminal activities taking place, they\u2019re going to look at it and those who are not charitable, there\u2019s the risk that they could determine that or assert that Maker DAO is a general partnership, whereby everybody has liability for everybody else\u2019s actions. So that\u2019s the crux of it is.   Niklas: Are delegates more exposed than a facilitator or any member of a core unit? 31:12  Paper: It has to do with identifiable odds; they would probably go after the VCs first, just because that\u2019s where the money is.  Rune Christensen: We don\u2019t have the expertise to discuss something like this. We\u2019re talking about these specific things, but the real problem is that we don\u2019t know the big picture. We don\u2019t even know what we want out of the delegates. And the reality is, we don\u2019t know what we want or the delegates because we don\u2019t know what we want out of anything. We\u2019re missing this overall big picture. And that\u2019s one of the main points I\u2019ve made in this whole clean money proposal: these concepts of the Ice Age, which is this idea that you have a defined environment where things don\u2019t change, and you have what I call the world map. So that the scope and the breadth of what\u2019s being done in the bureaucracy. These things need to be considered holistically; they need to be connected. Probably no role is more sort of, in that situation, that the delegate in that it\u2019s just you, you really cannot define what the delegate is without defining what the other pieces are. And then how they\u2019re supposed to interact, right? That\u2019s what delegates are supposed to do. They\u2019re supposed to interact with the rest of the governance process on behalf of MKR holders, and then the question is how are we supposed to treat the rest of the governance process, and that is the central thing that we need to figure out. An overall theory of how we want all of this stuff to look, and I think that then the discussion we\u2019re having now I think is I mean the kind of things that have been considered a lot of this stuff is incredibly useful right is incredibly important to exercise to go through these things   Rune Christensen: We don\u2019t have the expertise to discuss something like this. We\u2019re talking about these specific things, but the real problem is that we don\u2019t know the big picture. We don\u2019t even know what we want out of the delegates. And the reality is, we don\u2019t know what we want or the delegates because we don\u2019t know what we want out of anything, right? We\u2019re missing this overall big picture. And that\u2019s one of the main points I\u2019ve made in this whole clean money proposal: these concepts of the Ice Age, which is this idea that you have a defined environment where things don\u2019t change, and you what I call the world map, right? So that the scope and the breadth of what\u2019s being done in the bureaucracy. These things need to be considered holistically; they need to be connected. Probably no role is more sort of, in that situation, that the delegate in that it\u2019s just you, you really cannot define what the delegate is without defining what the other pieces are. And then how they\u2019re supposed to interact, right? Because that\u2019s what delegates are supposed to do.  34:31  Prose: It is important to discuss the greater role and what a delegate looks like, and traditional, like Companies, things we\u2019re familiar with, so we can compare, see what aspects we like and want to take with us. What we\u2019re saying with this, in terms of what a delegate is and what they\u2019d have to do to get paid under, what we\u2019re putting forward here is that they have to acquire some amount of delegated MKR. In theory, that could be coming from them. We don\u2019t necessarily know if that\u2019s the case or not. They have to do a call poster platform talk about what they stand for and their guiding principles as a delegate. Then they have to participate in votes and communicate how they participated and why they participated. From the governance side, we gain a lot from having recognized delegates in terms of consensus building and compromise and understanding why things don\u2019t pass.  LongForWisdom: I\u2019d like to emphasize that the requirements we\u2019ve set out are the bare minimum that we would need delegates to do, right? Once we have that, then we can start layering.     Katie: You guys are saying that you have a list of responsibilities and expectations for a delegate. 37:58  LongForWisdom: They need to write a platform, host the meeting, and they need to show up and ask questions for an arrow. They need to vote consistently, and they need to communicate why they\u2019re voting consistently to get paid. They\u2019re paid depending on how much they\u2019ve delegated as well. The way it\u2019s set up is it increases logarithmically exponentially. You get paid more; the first 10 Maker you get is worth more than the last 10, you get a delegated up to like 10,000, which is where the maximum comes in. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re instantly paying people the full amount; we\u2019re paying them. We want it to be front-loaded because it attracts people more and sort of covers for when they\u2019re just getting started. They don\u2019t have a lot of MKR delegated, which is why it\u2019s exponential.   Rune Christensen: There\u2019s something like this a cap on how many delegates will get paid, right? 39:11  LongForWisdom: We don\u2019t currently have that. No, I think that if we get to that situation, we can deal with it. Right now, I\u2019d be thrilled to have like, 10, 20, 30.  Katie: It seems like, from the conversation, the biggest issue people have is that there isn\u2019t a scope of work for a delegate, but it sounds like you do have them. Let\u2019s come to an understanding what\u2019s the scope of work, nothing beyond that. Then it makes a lot more sense to me, but there\u2019s been a lot of operational-type things that people have mentioned that would be a delegate\u2019s responsibility. I think it\u2019s crucial to develop a specific role of what the delegate is and what they\u2019re responsible for.    40:30  Juan: The documentation or what Long mentioned is already there; it\u2019s relatively simple. I think that we should focus on Americans is a really bad idea. So if someone wants to weigh in, we should focus on all the other elements that one mentioned that should be in place for this method to work and make sure that everything\u2019s connecting properly.  Juan: The documentation or what Long mentioned is already there; it\u2019s relatively simple. I think that we should focus; maybe it is a really bad idea if someone wants to weigh in, but we should focus on all the other elements that Rune mentioned that should be in place for this method to work and to make sure that everything\u2019s connecting properly.   LongForWisdom: If there\u2019s very little we can do to prevent MKR holders from delegating to delegates. Any list of requirements we set out is difficult to enforce. Let\u2019s say you are paying a delegate, and then they stop fulfilling the requirements; how do you stop paying them? As long as we hold certain objects too strenuously, they\u2019re going to keep delegating to them, like; they\u2019re going to need to pass on votes to cancel whatever payment stream is going on. It\u2019s difficult to define because it\u2019s not up to the DAO where the delegated Maker goes; it\u2019s up to the individual Maker holders. That\u2019s my concern with trying to find some rigorous framework.  42:08  Rune Christensen: We can\u2019t define the rules for being a delegate because we\u2019ve become so used to this environment where there is no connection between MKR holders voting and Governance. In theory, it should be MKR holders in charge, and then they have the votes. And they say, this is what we\u2019re looking for in delegates, and then delegates show up, and then they get delegated to. We have to find a way to bridge that gap. People just aren\u2019t delegating right now.  MakerMan: My understanding is that we weren\u2019t able to pass executives. And when I read from Long as you\u2019re saying that they were going to have GovAlpha had to chase down VCs to vote, right? And so there was a real issue within Governance, that Maker wasn\u2019t doing its job. And so, the delegation was proposed as a solution to that. You want to do it, Maker, because what you want to do is punish the people who don\u2019t participate and reward those who do. And the whole point is, is that you want the Maker that\u2019s participating in performing. So basically, you kind of want to align the reward and punishment assignment incentives to make that happen. And the idea of doing it with delegates, it\u2019s kind of convoluted, and you look at the results that we have right now. We have two delegates that themselves can pretty much pass any green light. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s like Maker or Long, you know, the numbers on these things like 3000, to do this 10,000 to do this, right? We got two guys with more than 10,000 that pretty much drop whatever they want through the polls, they can\u2019t do executives, but together, two, maybe three, could do an executive, I don\u2019t know. When I look at the result, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting what we need. And when I think about being a delegate, man to look at the system and interact in the forums and deal with CPUs, you know, it\u2019s very daunting timelines. And, and I can\u2019t think about how to do that, in a way that just makes sense for me from a time perspective and achieving anything. And so it just becomes this whole messy proposition of like, what\u2019s the actual goal? What\u2019s the problem? Do you know what we\u2019re trying to solve? And what\u2019s the best way to do that, that aligns all the interests across the board, because if it\u2019s just delegation is just about getting Maker to vote, let\u2019s work on that, and you can utilize delegates as a voting performance engine, right? And figure out how to spread the Maker around because this idea that one person has 30,000 Maker, hey, you know, a VC has 3050 80,000 Maker, you know, that\u2019s the reality of the tokenomics. And the problem is that these people, these whales, basically aren\u2019t performing and Governance. And when you look at the way the tokenomics are spread, it\u2019s like, what 80% of the Maker is in the top 100 wallets, and then 15% is in the next 500. And then you\u2019ve got 5% in the last 1000s. And so the idea here is you need to reach to these people; I have no clue how to reach these people, except to give them incentives to play in this governance game, and invest them and do something creative, right? And I want to write something on this and work on this, but help, my time is so hammered. I\u2019m talking to lawyers trying to figure out if I get a trunk lawmaker that I vote here, do I have legal liability, you know, I\u2019m putting money and time into this in a way that I could just x by not being a delegate, and just work for some CPUs and still get and probably do get more done. We should look at the problem. And rethink the goals. And we can use the tools that we have to come forward with something that maybe works better. We don\u2019t know what the problem is. And we don\u2019t have a good approach towards measuring the goal achievement, applying solutions to do that, and seeing how it works. We just tried one, and it doesn\u2019t look like it had its improved performance. We have still had the staggered Maker ability, and delegates really can\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t see any way that I\u2019m going to get up to 1000. Maker, I don\u2019t know. I mean, who do I have to talk to. And there\u2019s no place where people who want to delegate can interact with the delegates themselves and go. Hey, I want to. I\u2019m chopping around, you know, maybe you can be my delegate. And it\u2019s like, so all of this creates barriers and hazards and issues for everybody. And I don\u2019t know how we get out of them. So thank you, guys.    48:56  Sebastien Derivaux: I agree with most of what MakerMan said. And I understand that let\u2019s move. Besides the fact that delegates are here mainly to pass as a continuous, that was the initial problem. But when you are a delegate, just a supervisor, or someone with a remote funds organization, you have only one job to focus on one thing. We\u2019ll be addressing it repeatedly, trying to see what is most important and tell it, and it\u2019s easy when you are in the organization to go down the rabbit hole to analyze the budget and everything. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too good of the delegates because that\u2019s a full-time job. I worked with Mark for more than a week now on how to use finance to put more strategic value instead of Maker because we are spending a lot of cash. We don\u2019t have a strategy for MakerDAO, so While you can go into the rabbit hole and see every line on the budget, but that\u2019s not changing the movies in either. And what I learned as being a board member of many startups is that you just have one thing to focus on and repeat it repeatedly. Because if you do too much, you don\u2019t get anything done. And so it\u2019s, it\u2019s why you should be remote as well. Because if you are full-time on a project, you will no longer see your world picture.  50:42  LongForWisdom: I will comment briefly on some of the initial issues that Makerman has mentioned. Those are important as well. In terms of making those points, we must address the problem of bypassing executives and getting more votes. When we have that problem, we turn to delegation because that is the lowest hanging fruit for fixing this problem. At some point, we will want to reach the 25% of Maker holders holding bonds. That number of people is comparably higher than the whales holding large amounts, which may benefit the delegation. The VCs all want delegation because it allows them not to vote every week. They do not like weekly voting as they are not close enough to vote informedly without spending time. That is where we tend to delegate. It should still work itself out because the VCs will want to set up the custody platforms to delegate. But now the problem is the lack of delegates. As Makerman said, there is not a great deal of them. As other people have mentioned, working on this problem starts with bringing more coders into the conversation, in a way, like three delegates. To do this in the most possibly decentralized way, we need more delegates than we currently have. The easiest and quickest way of trying to get more delegates is by paying them. We can try to figure out a system of fancy tokenomics to bring about a solution. However, that would not solve the short-term problem of voter shortage. So, Nik commented on spending in the sidebar. We are talking about 744k Dai per year. If we are talking about ten delegates, that is roughly 1.44 million Dai. Right now, we are spending about 34 million on CUs. This spending is incredibly beneficial on the cost-benefit comparison. If we have this, we can gain so much. It is not that expensive relative to everything else we are doing. I do not understand why this is even a discussion; this is something that we need. I have showcased its importance.  53:55  Mark: Have you been in touch with any other prominent VCs that want delegation but have not yet been able to do so due to a lack of delegates? I would assume that most VCs will still delegate amongst themselves?  LongForWisdom: There is a couple of obstacles stopping the VCs from delegating currently. The main one is that the custody platforms need to integrate with the delegate contracts because the VCs will only interact with contracts through custody platforms. This interaction gives them an extra layer of defense against things breaking. Porter is here; you can answer this question.  Porter: No worries, you are doing a great job. I have enjoyed the conversation. Thank you, everyone. There are some technical difficulties behind it that we are currently working with our custodial platform to fix. We will resolve these difficulties within two weeks. I cannot speak to the other VCs, but we will publish what we did with the folks we work with. Hopefully, that will enable a bit more delegation in the future. That said, we are actively looking for delegates and delegating. We will have some announcements regarding that just for the group soon.    55:13  Mark: That is great to hear, Porter. I am not sure if you have contacted any VCs, but we should get some lists of larger holders or VCs to understand where they are in the process and why they are not delegated. This would be important. If the issue is just technical, we could see that coming soon. If it is due to the lack of delegates, that would be good to understand as well.  LongForWisdom: We have been in conversations with VCs about these topics for the last month. At one point, we were messaging them every week in trying to get them to vote. Everyone has a good understanding of the causes of our problems, which is why we proposed this awesome idea. However, I am not able to quote VCs on their problems and proposed solutions specifically. That is not how it works.    56:11  Mark: You do not need to say a specific VC. You could say, for example, that X amount of Maker has technical issues that they expect to resolve within X weeks or Y amount of Maker does not think there are enough delegates to delegate yet.  LongForWisdom: Although hard to tell because there are more coming and going, the three largest VCs firms all require this technicality. A few smaller ones have done it themselves and are willing to do it without custody platforms. But generally, that is not the case. Worrying about the available delegates is more on my side because the technical solutions are there. VCs are going to want to delegate to somebody in some form. Although not something I can confirm, but the VCs would instead delegate to recognize delegates. Part of our goal has been trying to convince other firms that it is in their best interest to spread their Maker across delegates they deem worthwhile as this increases decentralization and reduces the risk for the VC firms. There is less risk of anyone delegate going rogue and messing things up. However, if there are not enough recognized delegates, then they will dismiss you hire delegates directly. This will solve the problem of exposing executives but will not encourage those delegates to communicate with the community right beyond voting. This further communication is vital for transparency, accountability, and decentralization.    58:12  Rune Christensen: May I go into my presentation? It provides a lot of foundational perspectives that will help people think about all these different things. We have already gone an hour. Once I get started, I know there will be topics that people would like to discuss further. It is better to do this now rather than when everyone is exhausted.  LongForWisdom: We can make it the last call for people to comment on this topic. Katie: I just wanted to say thanks for the discussion. This has been great. I appreciate it.    59:02  Someone: I want to point one thing out. We have always had the difficulty of not knowing why a vote does not pass. Now, you can put a comment in an executive. That is cool. But knowing why a vote did not pass would be worth a lot in helping steer the organization to a better way.  Rune Christensen: That is not a minor extra detail but the central question of the entire project. You pointed at the fundamental factor that decides whether Maker will succeed or fail. The governance process does not work if there is no connection between voting behavior and the changes, strategies, and feedback loop between the results and decisions. It is then just randomly deciding what gets passed on. Communication around the reasons for voting, the voting topic, and voting methods are fundamental.    1:00:31  MakerMan: I want to echo that. The way the executive works is that you vote yes for a particular executive. The idea that someone is voting \u201cyes\u201d on an older executive gives no new information. There is no \u201cno\u201d vote against them. This part of the process immediately leaves out information. Did the person who voted \u201cyes\u201d for the old executive not participate, or did they vote \u201cno\u201d against the current executive? The polling is a little different. One of the key issues is that we are trying to get information in a mechanism that cannot provide the information on who voted \u201cno\u201d against executives. How do we get the feedback when the designed system mechanisms are incapable of giving us that feedback?  1:01:27  Rune Christensen: I want to do a little experiment. We just had this conversation about delegation with roughly ten people. I want to see how many people that came with inputs on the call spoke. How many are just regular MKR holders that are not part of the workforce? The workforce is anyone getting paid through core units, delegates who are not presently paid but expect a payment, or anyone with a special relationship with a protocol rather than just a regular account holder.  1:02:49  Rune Christensen: We see the disconnect in the same way. We just discussed delegation, but the entire framing of the discussion has not even considered the proper starting point. From the perspective of core units, the role of a delegate is to pass the executive votes that the core wants. To some extent, that is even harder than was discussed. While that is not how people view it, this is a rubber stamp to the votes. But ultimately, that is where the incentives lead us. We must think extremely carefully about the overall structure of Governance and especially the people\u2019s incentives. Who is participating, and for what reason? A delegate that engages in discussion about delegate compensation aims to maximize their compensation. Their incentive is the fundamental thing. The objective is to create value for MKR holders, grow the Maker protocol, and create value for end-users. We must recognize the pieces that achieve these outcomes in creating and then defining this value. The lack of feedback loop between MKR holders voting, proposals passing, voting conversations, and targeted objectives has created a great contradiction for our community. I will be focusing on this fundamental question over the next couple of weeks and beyond. The overall theme is essentially the governance earthquake of periods of very constant change and evolution of how Governance works. How do we get to a stable equilibrium where things just run and everybody is happy with how the process works?  1:06:12  LongForWisdom: Before starting the presentation, may we get a quick time check on how long it would take? As you said, it is getting late for people. I want to make sure people are prepared before they dive into it.  Rune Christensen: I can do it in 20 minutes unless people want to discuss things on the way. I am getting into the spiciest elements of Maker governance. These are the big questions that some may not have even considered, and others may have considered the elephant in the room perhaps even afraid to discuss. There is a good chance the discussion would spiral out of control, so people should keep that in mind. I am willing to discuss this all evening.    1:07:09  LongForWisdom: Do you want to separate this from the governance call to end this recording and potentially start another one? Okay, so we will call this here, and then we will spin up another recording to be recorded separately. Thank you to everyone who showed up for this call. Appreciate everyone, and we will pause the recording here. This was amazing.  Pablo: Thank you, everyone, for joining.

My name is Payton; I go by @prose11 online. I am one of the Governance Facilitators at MakerDAO. We like people to get involved and ask questions or comments, so please, do not be shy if you have something to say.   Weekly Updates  GovAlpha Core Unit update  Payton Rose 02:02 GovAlpha Weekly Update  Onboarding is going well. @LongForWisdom and I are splitting facilitator duties. We also have a bunch of contributors on our weekly CU meetings; some of them are new. We appreciate the increased participation in our CU. The new version of the MIPs portal is live. Check that out! Thanks to dSpot and @blimpa for their work on that. It\u2019s easier to navigate and use due to better responsiveness when scrolling down and a collapse feature for sub proposals. Another major highlight, @LongForWisdom, wrote a Quarterly Review of how the first quarter of us as a CU went. It concerns our budget, objectives, and what we were able to accomplish.   Governance 04:04  Currently, one poll is live. Do make sure that you vote on the Community Greenlight Poll - 0xBTC! Last week\u2019s executive is still up, so I encourage you to vote on it too. Currently, we are sitting at about 37 thousand MKR, and we need much more for it to pass.   Forum at a Glance  Sebix 04:52 Forum at a Glance for July 2nd - 8th  Three-Point Summary   Rates Changes, July Core Unit Budgets, and PSM DC-IAM - There\u2019s an ongoing executive vote to decide:  CU budgets distributions (totalling 2,510,503 DAI) Stability Fee decreases The activation of the PSM DC-IAM for USDC    Response to ChainLinkGod Accusations - A viral tweet posted by a member of the Chainlink community suggested MakerDAO is doing filthy business with Oracles. @nikkunkel sets the record straight. Peg\u2019s looking really good.   971\u00d7680 169 KB   ICYMI - Announcements   Maker Governance Review for June   @artem_gordon et al. present the Maker Governance Review for June.    Financial Report for June   @Aes creates the RWF financial report for June.    GovAlpha Quarterly Review Q2 2021   @LongForWisdom publishes GovAlpha Quarterly Review for the second quarter.     Discussions   Alternative MKR Compensation Guidelines  Propose an alternative, domain-tiered approach to MKR vesting. \u2018Update\u2019: MIP56 was created.    MakerDAO Hiring Proposal   @mikkkk\u2019s opinion on how MakerDAO should handle job compensations sparked off a richly ramified discussion.    Suggestions For Deciding Which Charities To Fund? @PaperImperium wonders aloud how we should decide which charities to fund and elicit diverse responses from the community.   Signal Requests   Aave D3M Target Borrow Rate  In preparation for the launch of the Aave Direct Deposit Dai Module, @hexonaut goes through the pros and cons of different possible spreads between the D3M and Maker\u2019s own rates.    Increase Debt Ceiling of RWA-02 (NS-DROP) from 5M to 20M  New Silver is asking to increase the DC to 20M from the current 5M, which is close to being reached.     Ongoing Initiatives   Collateral Calls - Calling all Projects!   @juan  sets up a signup thread for projects wishing to present on the bi-weekly collateral call. Know any potential collateral partners that you want to present? Refer them here.    Collateral Status Index  Confused about the current status of the various collateral types that have been discussed recently? Check out this post to find out the status and current position of each within the onboarding process.    Weekly MIPs Updates   @Davidutro, @charlesstlouis, and @blimpa bring the latest updates in the world of MIPs. Thanks for that.    MakerDAO Standard Governance Processes   @LongForWisdom writes a brief overview of the currently operating governance processes in the Maker community. Confused between Signals, Declarations, and MIPs? Look no further.    The Official Welcome Thread  A welcome and introductions thread. Not strictly speaking governance, but if anyone new or old wants to introduce themselves, now is your chance!     Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 08:39  Collateral Types  Regarding the Collateral Types, we did the MATIC Technical Evaluation. Sam had found an EOA address that still had access there. When Chris posted it, the MATIC team removed the address within 15 minutes. We\u2019re in the process of reviewing stETH, expecting information from the Oracles Team. I encourage the DAO to pay attention to this evaluation when it\u2019s up, as it\u2019s very detailed. As for now, we\u2019re sitting at high risk for this one. Sam is working on GUNI-DAI-USDC. It\u2019s the equivalent token for UniV3 of an LP token which is on V2. It takes a fixed spread and allows to provide fungible liquidity in that range.   Contract Work  We added DssFlash and DssVest to Dss-interfaces. A new tool that we\u2019re using, Certora, found a bug in the ssSVest code, which has already been tidied up. A shout out to the tool paying for itself. Having fixed all the bugs in it, we finished the Keeper implementation of the UniV2 LP tokens. For those who want to run the Keeper, it\u2019s \u2018auction-demo-keeper.\u2019 You need a little ETH for gas. Give it a private key without ETH, and it will backstop auctions based on the parameters you set in the config. It seems to be working well. One of the LP tokens had an auction this morning. The Keeper went off and serviced it. We got enhancements to support the UI functionality for CropJoin, as it requires changes. Regarding the auction keeper work for SushiJoin, we have been doing background work on the ClipperCallee implementation. Once the SushiJoin token is added, we will already have the code needed to service those auctions.   In Review  We are reviewing the L2 Dai Certora formal verification on the L2 Dai contract. There\u2019s lots of discussion on institutional/permission halts and the types of parameters we can set in the mandated actor\u2019s calls. I\u2019ve been evaluating testnets that we might use and getting stakeholders\u2019 opinions on those. We are strongly leaning towards Goerli at this point. I\u2019m waiting for any objections from the PE Team. I\u2019m also raising it now to speak up if you have any objections to us using it as a testnet in the future. Finally, There\u2019s a forum post on the ESM bug postmortem. Check that out.   Kris Kaczor  Optimism Dai Bridge was deployed on Mainnet yesterday. This means Dai users can move their Dai to Optimism, an L2 solution, and enjoy cheap secure transactions. This release will be governed by the Maker Governance. With us cutting all the admin access that we have today, it will be fully decentralized. We have a cool vanity address starting with \u201c0xDA1\u201d and ending in the same way. Today or tomorrow, there\u2019ll be an official Optimism gateway UI supporting Dai. Right now, you can only interact with it by writing a script. The official announcement from our side will occur today or tomorrow as well. Regarding Arbitrum, there\u2019s progress. We got a basic version of a bridge. Still, there\u2019s a lot of work ahead on that, including even rewriting the current implementation. We used Arbitrum\u2019s pre-made classes, but the code style is not the easiest to maintain.   Comments  Christopher Mooney: We were trying to find an address \u201cda1000\u201d (as in DAI) on each side, using many of my mining rigs. As it might take up to six months, we decided on the vanity address, which I find pretty sweet. SamM: Vote delegation is available on Kovan and Mainnet. Lucas Vogelsang: Could you say more about how the next couple of executive spells look like? I\u2019m asking because all of the Centrifuge collateral types are going through the legal updates, as discussed in the forum. They are on Kovan ready. When would be a good time to fit them into the executive schedule?  Christopher Mooney: Regarding the Centrifuge RWA, your team is working on an executive I\u2019ll review. We will deploy it this Friday on Kovan. For Mainnet, we could go next week. It\u2019s all about congestion now. We completely cleared DSSVest and Vox. The latter could go up, but our team wanted one more shot at reviewing it. Kurt Barry: Being optimistic, I could say that there\u2019ll be slots where the new Centrifuge assets could go out in the next one to three weeks. It\u2019s a little unpredictable as it depends on when other things will be unblocked, e.g., we\u2019ve been blocked on SushiLP tokens for a while. Lucas Vogelsang: Thanks, that\u2019s good enough. We\u2019ll work on Kovan and start getting ready for Mainnet.     Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 19:54  On Friday, we had some accusations flying on Twitter. It said we sold prioritized access to price data. That is completely untrue. Usually, we ignore that kind of stuff. Due to the claims\u2019 great amount of traction and aggressiveness, we addressed this particular one. It\u2019s one thing to say our network was closed and another to say we were intentionally profiting off of this kind of scenario. This week, we have started to ship the LibP2P integration to the production oracle network. It\u2019s a culmination of many months of work, as we started to theorize about it over a year ago. You probably heard me talk about Scuttlebutt previously. It\u2019s a P2P network to which the oracle feeds push their price messages and from which the relayers pick up the messages. Here, even despite being serverless, the network is the centralized point of failure. It\u2019s exposed to hacker attacks and bugs. Now, we have Scuttlebutt and LibP2P in parallel. Feeds will push their price messages to both Scuttlebutt, and LibP2P, and the relayers can pull their price messages from both. So now, from the oracle\u2019s point of view, if one of the networks goes down, nothing changes. I\u2019m really proud of the team for this shipping. It was complex, as LibP2P is not easy to work with. We were able to ship this big milestone at the end of our tenure at the Foundation. Once the production rollout is complete in about two weeks, we will make an announcement. On the non-tech side, we have been reviewing the oracle assessments for MATIC, SolarX, stETH tokens, and the D3M module. We will get at least some of them out by tomorrow to go into polling votes next week. Regarding the Oracles CU, we are about to finalize the relationship with our payroll processor. We have been setting up the entities and structures for the CU. We are in a hiring process, filtering through candidates and deciding which positions to prioritize. I\u2019ll be even more excited when the executive vote passes! We intend to spin out of the Foundation by the end of the month and fully operate as a CU.  LongForWisdom: Since the oracles now have two networks, Scuttlebutt and LibP2P, working side by side, how do the relayers determine precedence between them? How do the relayers decide which one is the right source if one is broken or publishes something wrong? Nik Kunkel: In conflict, you can prioritize one over another. One strategy for the default setting is pulling information from both, and the relayers look at the timestamp. This prevents the relayers from being opinionated on what message is good and bad.     Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 28:00  Most of our team is currently focused on D3M risk assessment. We\u2019re just about to finish it. The assessment with proposed parameters is in internal review now. The D3M DC is still under discussion in our group. We\u2019ll propose a smaller DC at launch to test the module. In the midterm, we\u2019ll suggest limiting our exposure to Aave in relation to either the share of DAI deposits with Aave or unutilized Dai borrow market. Regarding target borrow rate, Sam has already made a post on this topic. We want to gather feedback in the Signal Request to see how much we want Aave to be competitive versus Maker on the competitive risk angle. On the credit risk angle, in terms of how much Maker wants to be compensated for the risks taken when being directly exposed to Aave. We\u2019ll have all of this described in our extensive risk assessment report. Regarding institutional vaults and their implementation, we are preparing a post with PE and Growth. I personally like the idea of an origination fee. This might be an interesting product because it ensures that larger borrowers would likely have this credit line with Maker open for a longer time. This is because the origination fee is paid in advance rather than accrued over time. One of the other positive benefits is the surplus buffer, which would accumulate this fee instantly; the other is on the USDC peg because longer-term borrowers are less likely to farm with borrowed assets and more likely to sell on the market. In some way, it may attract more organic borrowers. We continue to improve the risk dashboard and are making plans regarding future collateral risk assessments. There\u2019s a large backlog of assets from SushiLPs, to MATIC and stETH.   Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 31:53 Real World Finance CU Report  For this week, we have made our monthly audit on NewSilver. They delayed the RWAs report because we have to wait on the icon thing on the NewSilver side. I\u2019m not seeing there to be much to disclose after tomorrow. NewSilver asked for our DC to be increased to 20 million DAI, which was approved by a community poll and will be on the Governance board next week if everything goes well and Protocol Engineering is happy. All the DCs and the new Centrifuge assets may be on next Friday\u2019s executive. Regarding SolarX, @christiancdpetersen posted a preliminary risk assessment to discuss where all the trenching of the debt is done. The main quality of the asset must be the PPA arrangement, which portrays a price arrangement of 20 years between the solar farm project and the buyer. That is done only in the fourth month. Before that, we have negotiated with the buyer to get the land and the courtyard. You can look at more stuff on the posts. On the SolarX front, the Foundation, the Cayman Foundation Incorporation, is the other work that we are doing. We have gotten questions about having a foundation and trust. The Foundation is more flexible in Cayman. You can see a big difference between trusts: you can achieve almost everything you want with a foundation, but not as much with just trust. You can more or less set up the Foundation to be just like trust. One has trust in the name, which seems better. Other than that, the Foundation is quite similar. It will give us more flexibility to have professional people on board to look at what MakerDAO asks on the blockchain and relay this information to the governance of the Foundation, which can be more difficult if you are using a trust. Currently, we are on the prospect list. We have two big publically quoted companies. That means that there is a lot of interest from big corporations to finance themselves using Maker. Obviously, it\u2019s not because we are a cheaper source of capital or are easier. It\u2019s mainly a PR play for them as well as to drive innovation forward. It\u2019s interesting to see there is a lot of demand for RWA loans from established companies. I published a post just before the call on Basel Bank Regulation. Bank of International Settlements (BIS) issues a Basel Regulation. There was a point about what capital banks should have compared to other assets in their balance sheet. It\u2019s super important because if a bank owned some USDC, then it amassed no capital; It\u2019s free for them, just like cash. But if they own Dai, it\u2019s a riskier asset for them. It\u2019s three times more costly to own Dai than to own MKR shares, Netflix shares, or other big company shares. It\u2019s two times riskier having equities from a startup. The same goes for the MKR token, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. It\u2019s not good for us because if we are at least 12 times more costly than USDC for banks, then we will probably not likely be using Dai going forward. We should find a way to put some commands into the BIS and see what can be done in this area. I don\u2019t know which CU will need to do that, so please respond to the post if you have any idea.   Questions  Planet_X: I have a question about the RWA legal structure That was posted. Does this have a preliminary timeline, or is it just completely on the conceptual level for now?  S\u00e9bastien: We want to have this legal structure for the SolarX investment. It should be done quickly. As I mentioned, SolarX was delayed because we negotiated to have more safety in the pre-project phase before they had the PPA agreement. We will have to get this structure in the next few months or earlier. Planet_X: All right. Thank you. S\u00e9bastien: The good thing with the Foundation is that we need to have the ability to upgrade, such as an agreement of the Foundation by vote on the blockchain using MKR token. If we can get that, we can always improve the structure.     Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 39:08 Growth CU Weekly Updates  Hey, everyone. We have been talking with Thorchain, and they want to include Dai in their pools, which is amazing because that will give us access to have a market between Dai and Bitcoin in its own chain. It\u2019s a very, very interesting project, and we will love to be there, but we are facing a challenge. How can we inject liquidity into Thorchain pools? Usually, we did this in the past through the Foundation. The Foundation was helping to bootstrap Dai liquidity in other protocols. Still, now that we don\u2019t have a foundation in the back, we have to find solutions. There are different solutions that we have thought about. Also, I wrote about this in the updates, but we are planning on writing up detailed posts in the coming days explaining the options we have. For example, we could find a company that offers Market Maker services, but we have to pay a fee for them to do that. There\u2019s also another strategy to set up a treasury for MakerDAO and use the treasury for these kinds of initiatives. Others will be finding a lending protocol to have a loan, but that also goes with a fee. The problem with providing liquidity is that it could be beneficial for us from an economic point of view because usually, these pools generate fees. In the beginning, they also have these liquidity mining opportunities. It could be a profitable opportunity for Maker in the case that we provide liquidity directly from a MakerDAO treasury, but this also comes with risks associated with the impermanent loss because if the pair is with another token that is not a stablecoin, we have the risk of impermanent loss in there. Also, there\u2019s a risk associated with the protocol itself. It\u2019s something that I want to discuss with the community because right now, we have this opportunity with Thorchain. Still, I know we will have future opportunities with other networks. We are seeing all these new L2s on different networks growing the ecosystem. We will continue to see this in the future, and it will be great if we can think about a framework to solve this. By the way, we are now part of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEC). This one is an organization that is looking for companies and enterprises to adopt Ethereum in any way. They work directly with big companies, for example, IBM, which is part of the EEC. They are researching companies that are not in the blockchain space and what they are looking for. We now can also have access to all other members. We could also use this channel to communicate about MakerDAO. Next week, Marble cards is going to launch the Maker Arena. You will be able to convert your favorite post, vote, executive poll into an NFT and play with it. Everything that the MakerDAO domain has will be part of this arena. The tweet of the week in the MakerDAO Growth Twitter:   1052\u00d71245 168 KB   Also, because we started a new month, we posted our PnL of the last month, June, in our weekly update. We want transparency with our expenses with the community.   Questions  LongForWisdom: Regarding PSMs and the other stablecoin issues, there hasn\u2019t been any progress with them or anything. I understand you can\u2019t talk about it too much necessarily, but are there any updates? Nadia: Yes, but a slow one. We have a call with Paxos on Friday. We will be posting an update about what is happening with Paxos, Binance, and Gemini. Sorry about the delay in our responses, but we depend on the answer from the counterparty, which is not as quick as we would like to. LongForWisdom: I was just curious how it\u2019s going. Thank you.   Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Update  Juan Guill\u00e9n 46:20  2217\u00d71235 156 KB   Hello, I\u2019ll give you a brief update on what we\u2019ve been up to. First off, almost the whole team is all together in Portugal. We\u2019re doing an offsite speaking out strategy, OKRs, branding, roadmap stuff, and whatnot.   1928\u00d71080 199 KB   We\u2019ve been working a lot on looking forward to making a lot of the things public that we\u2019ve been cooking up. I\u2019m quite impressed by the quality. The next item is that we actually decided to postpone the potential budget modification. We will postpone it until the next Governance cycle. Last week, we had Lenkla presenting project X-Ray. If you\u2019re interested, the [video] is in the SES public drive. Tomorrow, July 9th, we\u2019ll be presenting takeaways from the offsite at 2:30 UTC. Join us.   1928\u00d71080 125 KB   In other news, we\u2019re looking forward to collaborating with the Growth CU for the EthCC event in Paris. We will be speaking at the DAOist on the 23rd of July. We\u2019re looking forward to that. Also, we have been helping the DAI Foundation with MIPs that have been published yesterday evening. Check them out. We\u2019re looking forward to starting the discussion on managing the assets from the DAI Foundation and having someone protecting all these assets. Regarding the Incubees, there\u2019s not a lot of news, but we\u2019ll have a new announcement soon, so stay tuned. We scheduled a Know Your MIP session for B.Protocol on November 8th.   Content Production Update  Seth Goldfarb 49:15 Content Production Biweekly Updates  The Mascot Art Contest is live. Details are in the forum and on social media channels. Please make your art to help MakerDAO decide between the dragon and capybara as a mascot. You also get to win some Dai and swag for participating. Send your submissions to [email\u00a0protected]. This will be running until the end of July. We\u2019re really excited to welcome Kat Obermeyer to the team and back to MakerDAO. Most of you are probably familiar with her work. Kat was involved in doing a lot of the original design work for MakerDAO and was responsible for helping to set up MakerChat. She\u2019ll be helping us out with design community management. Really excited! Unfortunately, the writer that we had slated to join the team this week had a personal issue come up and will not join the team, so we are looking for another writer again. There were a few candidates that we spoke with before, and we\u2019ll be circling back to them. If anyone knows any good writers they would like to see working in the DAO, please feel free to send them our way. Our next budget should be moved to formal submission. Our initial budget ran funds through July, covering the team in August, September, and October. That also includes a month\u2019s buffer for the team just in case there\u2019s ever a hiccup in the budget distribution. I believe the vote for that will be going up in the next few days. Other than that, the team\u2019s focus for the last couple of weeks has been on video production. We\u2019ve done an informal audit of the video work that top projects are doing. While there\u2019s a lot of basic content, the production quality is relatively low compared to what we\u2019re planning on putting out. We see this as a good opportunity to set ourselves apart; Putting out videos with a higher level of quality gives us a significant advantage concerning search algorithms. YouTube is popularly recognized in marketing as the world\u2019s second-largest search engine. So we see this as a really good opportunity to create content that will steer people who are generally interested in crypto to be a little more interested in MakerDAO. Our focus there, for the time being, is on governance and tech-related content. We\u2019ve started reaching out to some of the CUs to sync on that, and we\u2019ll continue to reach out in the next couple of weeks on that. Tomorrow, we\u2019ve got an AMA with Robert Jordan to talk about the proposed Collateral Engineering CU. As I understand it, Robert was involved in creating the original collateral onboarding process. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about collateral onboarding or that proposal, please bring your questions. Next Friday, we\u2019ll have an AMA with David Utrobin to talk about updated plans for the Governance Communications CU, which I believe is now informal submission to vote on as well. That\u2019s all the updates I have for this week. Happy to take questions if anybody has them or pass them back to Payton.   MIPs Update  David Utrobin 53:37 Weekly MIPs Update #43  To innovate our update, we are combining it with the monthly Submission Review by GovAlpha Facilitators.   1446\u00d7798 153 KB   As a reminder, there\u2019s a new monthly cycle process. There used to be Inclusion Polls, bundled Governance Polls, and Executive Votes. Now, we have each MIP sub-proposal go through an individual two-week Ratification Poll. As of July 8th, we have just concluded formal submissions for this month.   Payton Rose  1436\u00d7809 67.2 KB   1444\u00d7807 130 KB   There\u2019s an AMA on Collateral Engineering Services this Friday. To learn more about AmaZix Marketing, check out their Launch Pod Session.   1440\u00d7803 154 KB   Governance Communications will have their Launch Pod Session next Friday. Strategic MarComms gave an update on their proposal for a CU.   1441\u00d7812 169 KB   Presented MIPs and sub proposals will be voted on this Monday.  @amyjung is the author of MIP55. MIP52 was put together by @g_dip. The MIP details a process for settling disputes within the organization. A standard process utilizes the monthly cycle. Additionally, there\u2019s an urgent process where some MKR is burnt to get a resolution sooner. Take a look at SP19: GRO-001 and SP21: MKT-001 in the forum.   David Utrobin  1432\u00d7802 64.7 KB   1440\u00d7804 132 KB   There\u2019s a lot of good discussion on the new Maker Portfolio CU in the forum threads.   1441\u00d7797 84.8 KB    MIP56: Alternative MKR Compensation Guidelines was posted @Aes, a member of the working group that worked on MKR compensation packages. @Planet_X had once posted a MIP and then withdrew it. This is another attempt by members of that group to put up a similar proposal. Make sure to check it out!   Presentations and Other Discussions  General Open Discussion and Updates 01:01:33  Payton: Does anybody have anything, in particular, they want to discuss? I will give it few moments for thought. If not, there are one or two things I can poke at and maybe get some discussion going.  LongForWisdom: We\u2019ve got like 20 minutes left for discussion. Greg asked earlier about delegation. I can give a very vague and brief update on how that\u2019s going; As I\u2019m aware, the UI is still sort of on track. We\u2019ll try and announce a target launch date in the next week or so. I want to make sure everyone can confirm before saying anything definitively. We\u2019re still working with the potential delegates. If anybody hasn\u2019t spoken to me yet wants to be a delegate, please let me know. We can start dealing with some of that. So far, it\u2019s been good to see a couple of the delegate\u2019s position statements. It\u2019s looking really cool. I\u2019m hoping that Maker does well in terms of community and governance. I want us to have the best delegation that feels great once we launch. I guess we\u2019ll see.   Christopher Mooney: Kris, do we have the link to the DAI Bridge? Anyone wants to play with it?  Kris Kaczor: Or UI? Christopher Mooney: Yeah. Kris Kaczor: Not yet. I mean, they asked me not to share this staging URL. David Utrobin: Come on. It\u2019s only to your closest friends of 40 people. Payton: And the YouTube audience. I do have a question on the bridge: Are there any functionalities that can generate revenue for us from it, or is it just a pure bridge at this point? Kris Kaczor: At this point, there are no special features. It\u2019s just a plain bridge. It doesn\u2019t have all surface withdrawals. It\u2019s just to ensure that DAI is famous, and Optimism is one of the first tokens to launch there. Later, once we deploy this first withdrawal version, we can then have a revenue stream connected to the fact that we mint DAI for the future to promise future withdrawal. Also, we can think about moving some parts of the system, like DssCore, to roll up later and access all the collateral available there. It\u2019s a bit more of a long-term game. Payton: Awesome. Definitely looking forward to seeing that UI when it drops. LongForWisdom: If I recall correctly, are the bridges gradable? You guys were going to sort of transfer Control to the DAO or to the DSS polls, I guess? Kris Kaczor: Exactly. Control is already in the hands of the DAO. We still have an admin key, but we can get rid of that in like 20 minutes. The thing is that the DAi address won\u2019t change, so we have this awesome vanity address, which will stay the same. In the future, we\u2019ll deploy upgraded versions of the bridges that are opt-in. LongForWisdom: Cool. Thanks.   Payton: Okay, I\u2019m going to go ahead and stop the recording. Thanks for joining us.

Oracles Core Unit (MIP40c3-SP45)  Nik  Gas costs for Oracles are currently not included in the current Oracle budget.  This will come later. Maker Foundation generously provided these gas costs to help provide Oracles CU for time on a best-decision approach.   Asking for a rolling 3-month budget.  $3,568,849.20, which includes operational and gas costs.  $3,033,522 if including refunded funds by Maker Foundation over gas cost.     Will submit their MIP soon. Their MIP will provide a lot of perspective and data on spending costs for gas and Oracles and factors that affect Oracle costs.  Nik breaks down the medianizer gas costs and Oracle Security Module Uni LP + Spotter gas costs. Provides gas distribution of the OmegaPoker contract. Provides a quantitative observation and analysis of Oracles. Estimated total annual Oracle cost: $7,236,833.10  This estimate does not account for rising gas costs.     $1,784,424.60 emergency fund for unique market or gas events. 1/3rd of the cost comes from Oracles, and 2/3rd comes from the maintenance and security of Oracles.

Have you thought about that at all?  Daniel: Can you rephrase the question about if we thought about front running by bots?   LongForWisdom: Because the flash loan auction transactions are pretty easy to front-run. They are self-contained, and they do not require any capital. This UI looks awesome. But if every time anyone uses it, the transaction fails, then that is not ideal.  The main purpose of the UI is to have another backstab solution. If there is no participation that you can participate in through the UI, then the next step will be providing scripts or APIs to participate in these auctions. Currently, we do not see front running as a problem. But rather, it is good if someone is bidding on these auctions.    25:06  Rema: First of all, this is great for our keeper ecosystem. You said that you are only supporting Uniswap. Is it v2 or v3? Does the price in the UI include slippage as well? Price slippage when selling this collateral?  Lucas: It is a v2 for now. We are planning to upgrade, to support also automatic routing at some point. It includes the slippage, so it is calculated based on the amount sold using the Uniswap SDK.     Oracles Core Unit (MIP40c3-SP45)  Niklas Kunkel  Unfortunately, I do not have sexy presentations and videos like everyone else. I have MIPs that are pretty text-heavy, but that will do it. We talked about this on previous calls. Right now, the gas costs for the Oracles are not included in the current Oracle CU budget. Those would come at a later date. Also, Maker Foundation generously offered to front the gas costs since August 1st to give the CU more time to figure out how to do this best. The tooling that we had back then to delve into, what Oracles cost us from an infrastructure point of view we are not very granular. We had the holistic view that we know how much ETH is going in and how much we are spending in total. We did not have a more granular or scalpel view of the ETH Oracle to be costing us this much, the ZRX Oracle costing us this much, and the Uniswap LP Oracles this much. We have recently started creating tooling and dashboards that give us insight into these types of things. It is time to finish the transition of the Oracle CU and the Oracle infrastructure out of the foundation and have it be completely decentralized. We are thinking of structuring this so that we will typically be asking for a rolling three-month budget. We will submit a MIP, a sub proposal, and we expect to spend this amount in the next three months. What is different from this first proposal is that it will include the repayment to the Maker foundation for fronting the cost since the beginning of August. Since that is a rolling timer, we assumed that the MIP or some version of the MIP should be passed due to how governance works by the end of December. We will say in the MIP that the cutoff for that is the end of December. If it gets passed, earlier or later, we will have to adjust the payment amount to the foundation. What I want to get across today with this MIP is the analytics. Where they are coming from, and how we deduce the numbers in the budget for the MIP itself. These are dune analytics that we have hooked up to the smart contracts. We can provide the link for these. You can verify the data for yourself.   1920\u00d71134 164 KB   Modify CU Budget1920\u00d71126 214 KB   Motivation1920\u00d71130 253 KB   Background1913\u00d71128 265 KB   Factors which Affect Oracle Costs1920\u00d71123 278 KB   Number of Oracles1918\u00d71143 263 KB   Quantitative Observations1920\u00d71141 237 KB   1920\u00d71142 224 KB   Medianizer Cumulative Gas Costs1920\u00d71132 214 KB   Oracle Gas Fees Pairs1916\u00d71109 239 KB   Medianizer Cost by Asset Pair1920\u00d71120 210 KB   Daily Gas Consumptions1920\u00d71123 198 KB   Oracle Security Module Uniswap LP Oracle1920\u00d71135 214 KB   Gas Distribution of OmegaPoker1918\u00d71136 224 KB   Quantitative Analysis1920\u00d71147 209 KB   1920\u00d71130 194 KB   1920\u00d71128 214 KB   1920\u00d71135 235 KB   1920\u00d71136 248 KB   Vaults1920\u00d71126 213 KB   Gas Costs trending up1920\u00d71135 234 KB   1911\u00d71117 223 KB   Questions with Niklas 50:11  Aes: Was your assumption on doubling costs based on the actual costs for the past 99 days? Or is it based on the current run rate?  It is based on the current run rate. The sampling since August is not that relevant. If you zoom out from the chart, it is very volatile. Using that type of limited data set, trying to establish some kind of trend is quite foolish. I would not focus too much on the 2X number; it is a spitball number. There is not a big data set to come up with anything more algorithmic or deterministic.    51:12  Aes: I am looking at the average gwei assumption used for the forecast. Right now, the average gwei is around 175 a day. Would that imply about 350 for the doubling?  It depends if you want to use the today value or write the sampling over the last period. I do not take much stock in the gas price today because a week ago, I saw like 60 gwei.   LongForWisdom: It takes a while for the gas prices to adjust to the new ETH price and stuff.  These are the numbers that governance should consider when thinking of onboarding a new collateral type. For example, ETH has cost us historically 330k since August. If now the gas prices double, you are looking at 660k. Any Vault that is going to make less than 660k you should not bother. You are coin flipping based on if the gas price will not go up and screw us. It would be best if you thought of only the big-ticket Vaults that can generate at least 2 million of stability fees, at the very least. You are still paying people very high salaries to onboard those things. You should be thinking higher.    53:35  Aes: Is the plan also to buy a lump sum of ETH essentially? How do you think about the technical funding of it?  I did not put that implementation in the MIP because I wanted to give the CU more flexibility in trying out different solutions in that regard. We would want some of it in ETH, some of it in Dai. The rough number off the top of my head would be like a 50 50. You want some exposure to ETH but not all of your exposure in ETH. Ideally, in the future, we get actual gas features that we can use to hedge our gas costs, like airlines use oil features to hedge their jet fuel costs. We will try a few different types of models to see what works better. The goal is not to get the ultimate lowest cost for running the Oracles; it is more just to bound those costs, to make them more deterministic. The more we can constrain the range of costs, the better off we are.    55:19  Aes: We can hedge it simply by holding ETH on the balance sheet. The more ETH goes up, our balance sheet assets will go up, which can also be used in the feature to fund Oracle fees. Something that we can discuss on the forums.  Let us discuss it on the forum. I do not want it all in ETH because of these Black Thursday-type scenarios where everything is crashing. Prices are going down. And yet, gwei could be obscenely high, with people willing to pay $5,000, $10,000 transaction fees. If we are completely in ETH, we would be screwed by that type of event.    56:23  David Utrobin: I always imagined that the Maker protocol could use the surplus buffer directly like a split solution, where some of it is held in the Surplus Buffer, a little goes on MKR, and then a little bit is used to buy ETH dollar-cost averaging over time, and making a native pool within the protocol of ETH that can automatically pay Oracles. What do you think about that vision?  It is something that community should discuss more. My initial inclination is that we should not do that. The purpose of the CUs is to delegate the responsibility of things. Governance does not have to be an expert on all of this different stuff. Taxing governance with the inventory management for the Oracles would be a mistake. If governance wants to have exposure to ETH and diversify some of the Surplus to ETH, have at it. I would not do it specifically because of Oracle ETH inventory management.    58:13  Prose11: In terms of the Uniswap Oracle, you mentioned the v2 ones and their costs. Are they any cheaper when we are already running Oracles for the underlying assets?  This was purely for the gas cost of running that Uniswap Oracle smart contract. If you need to create new medianizers for the component tokens and those, then go ahead and add the medianizer costs on top of that. We do not currently have that for any of the tokens where we onboarded a Uniswap LP token pair, and we did not have the medianizers already, quote-unquote, for free because we would have already onboarded those assets in Maker.    59:36  Nadia Alvarez: About onboarding new collaterals. It would be great if you could add the cost of that collateral to your risk assessment. I was surprised by the Gelato LP token.  Those are expensive. It is 377k for the GUNI one, minus 5% uncertainty because the sample size is relatively small. That is the annual cost.    1:01:03  LongForWisdom: The stability fee is currently more than that, nice.  Until we just rugged it because of PSM fees. We will have to see going forward how much it generates.    1:01:20  Prose11: Would that be similar for other v3 implementations? Or is it unique to Gelato?  I do not know. For example, Kurt is creating the curve LP Oracle. We could do the stake ETH ETH curve pool as a collateral type. People can get staked ETH yield and the curve Lido yield. We do not know beforehand how much demand there will be for that Vault and how much Oracle will cost until we see it running. There will be cases where it is not clear-cut for governance on the costs and the upside. We have to make some educated guesses at some point. For this other stuff, the standard Oracles, a typical collateral type, we know the cost very precisely, to a degree of uncertainty with gas prices. We have experience in knowing how much this will cost. It is better not to bother if the collateral type does not generate 2 million instability fees.    1:03:27  PaperImperium: Do you know how many hours it requires to build the Oracles? Can we add those to the estimated cost of onboarding?  Once you have built it, you have built it. The costs to deploy another one is relatively low; they are incremental costs. Building it out the first time, getting it audited, and feeling comfortable that it is secure is costly. There are things that the CU can add to its roadmap to limit some of the costs that we spend on Oracles. We can, for example, offboard some of the unprofitable Vaults. That is gas that we would not be spending on those vaults. If governance does that, we might not spend this estimated budget. We would be spending less. We can make tuning parameters on the Oracles to make them cost a little bit less. Not 50% less but 20 or 25% less. That is a discussion that has to be had with Risk. When decreasing the sensitivity of the Oracle, how much more risk does it put on the Maker protocol in terms of holding assets longer than it would otherwise. It comes with the decreased operation cost for the Oracles. What happens with L2? That is still an open question. We suspect that L2 Oracles will be cheaper than Layer1 Oracles. If there were to be some Maker, either the full protocol or some shell of a protocol, on Layer2, L2 could support collateral types that L1 cannot support because of the Oracle costs. I want to caution of thinking of L2 as this. To think that is going to fix all of our problems. I want to caution against that for the following reasons. L2 segregates computational costs from storage. You do not have to do computation on L1, which is expensive. You do the computation on L2. All call data, including the data passed to the smart contract on Layer2 to do those transactions, needs to be recorded on Layer1. Oracles are very heavy on the call data; at least, the medianizers are. LSM, and spotter not so much. The reason is that you need to get a consensus of a bunch of feeds. If you have 26 feeds, you need at least 13 to reach a quorum of ETH\u2019s price. For each of those feeds, you need the price, the timestamp, and the signature saying that I have verified through my identity the time, price, etc., which you need for each of the 13 feeds. Much data gets passed to these functions. We will have to do some experiments to see the realized costs on L2. I do not want to promise the world and then have it come short. There will be cost savings. I do not know to what magnitude yet.    1:08:19  MakerMan: Do we have a number per collateral what it costs? What amount of ETH do we need to operate the Oracles per collateral type? That should be roughly linear. A year and a half ago, everyone wanted to add lots of collateral types. I was saying to be careful. If they do not make us money, it is going to cost us money. It is costing us money. We have got a fixed cost ETH per collateral type. So we can target the amount of Dai that we think we will earn by putting up a collateral type.  I agree. Gas costs used to be a lot lower. From an economics point of view, things that made sense back then now make less sense or do not make any sense. We can stop pursuing things of low economic return just for the sake of doing them. We can focus on bigger targets. There was this whole drama with the Matic token because there was an agreement that they would mint a lot more Dai, and we onboarded them based on that agreement. They mint some Dai, but they did not mint enough according to the agreement that we had. Given how much they have borrowed, it is an unprofitable vault. Unless they can be convinced to uphold the original agreement and mint significantly more Dai than they are doing, we should offboard them because it is unprofitable.   MakerMan: When gas was one gwei, and ETH was like $200, we had a completely different ecosystem and network than 100 gwei with ETH at $5,000. Unless something radically changes, we could have ETH at $10,000 and be at 200 gwei in a heartbeat. Do we know how much ETH it takes for a particular collateral type? So that we can target and try and get to levels. I was looking at the MATIC Vault. There were 79 million in collateral. They were minting about nine, and their cap was 10. They do not feel like they can move. They wanted to go beyond 10. We can address these issues. We need to think about a future with a higher ETH price and higher gas costs and work against what Vaults would have to maintain profitability. We might get to a point where we have to run on profitably on Oracle\u2019s because gas prices might be high temporarily. We do not want to close Vaults because they are slightly unprofitable, not if we can make it grow. If we cannot, then we need to ax them. There are several Vaults that we need to look at carefully to ax. Is there a number on ETH for one collateral type? What does it cost us an ETH for collateral type? We can run these numbers in the future.  There is no consistent ETH number. It is not like it is 100 ETH to run this oracle, and if the price of ETH goes up or down, it does not matter; it is 100 ETH. That is not how gas prices work. They are highly volatile. The causality here is questionable, but there is a relationship between ETH going up and gas prices going up. Maybe it is that markets are going up there, it generates more interest, more activity, and therefore gas prices go up. There is some correlation, but it is not absolute. There are events like Black Thursday where ETH can go down, and yet gas prices go inverse. However, gas prices could go sky high. We need to have a plan in place. Maybe it is okay for Vaults to be a little bit unprofitable for some time. We need to define what is unprofitable that we are willing to ETH and what we mean by some time. We have to make sure that there is a straightforward course of action when we violate those thresholds. So we do not spend two, three months of bureaucracy trying to decide what to do. There should already be a plan in place, and we execute on it.   I am trying to get a handle on cost per collateral type within medianizer. If we do \u201cN,\u201d what is the cost for N+1. There is a total cost for the whole thing that is probably fixed to some element. But then there is a cost per collateral type. What does it cost for us to have the system and add individual collateral types? All this other stuff comes out of that.  Those are the numbers that I presented in the MIP. I will be publishing this. You can take a look at those numbers more closely. But they are just what we have seen in the past. They are not indicative of what we see in the future. You have to look, for example, at the number 330k and think how it scales, not fixating on the number. If we assume an awful scenario where gas prices triple, then it is a million. But that is what it costs us to onboard a collateral type today. It is not what it might cost us a month, three months, or a year from now.   LongForWisdom: We cannot do this because the cost is denominated in gas units. The price of gas changes as gwei changes, and the price of that change is based on ETH. We could figure out the total gas units each thing costs per month, a fixed amount. But you cannot figure out a fixed amount in ETH terms or dollar terms.  1:16:42  Joshua: I was living in this fantasy world where I thought level-2s would solve our problems. The stock exchanges have 1000s of stocks, like Russell 3000 and New York Stock Exchange. Do we have a plan for supporting that throughput?  It remains to be seen. Sharding, which is this fairy tale unicorn thing that people talk about, is still years off, which helps with the data component. L2s are supposed to solve the computation component. Shards solve the data problem. Are there some things that maybe we can do? It is all trade-offs and compromises. It is what compromises are. Is Maker governance willing to accept in other areas in order to reduce things like Oracle costs? For example, we looked at the medianizer cost being a third of the total Oracle cost of this Oracle Security modules spotter combination. If governance is willing to go an Oracle attack on certain Vault types that are maybe smaller in debt ceiling size, you could hook up a medianizer to a Vault. Is that a good trade-off to make? I do not want to comment on that, and everyone will be very opinionated on that. There is no magic bullet. It is where you want to pile the risk up.

My name is Payton Rose; I go by @Prose11 on the Maker Forum. I am one of the Governance Facilitators. I\u2019m joined here by a bunch of awesome people interested in MakerDAO and how it\u2019s running. We like people to get involved and ask questions or comments, so please, do not be shy if you have something to say.   Weekly Updates  Governance  Payton Rose 01:10  Two polls ended today: The Open Market Committee rates and the UNIV2DAIUSDC-A Maximum DC.   Current executive for Centrifuge Asset Onboarding:  CF-DROP HTC-DROP FFT1-DROP P1-DROP   One active Community Greenlight Poll for 120dB Films RWA.   GovAlpha Core Unit Update GovAlpha Weekly Update  It has been a busy week for us regarding our Soft Launch of Voter Delegation, which happened on August 2nd. You can now view delegates in the voting portal. Also, we hosted the second Meet Your Delegate call on August 4th. We have our first draft of our combined Q4 2021 and Q1 2022 Budget complete, which will be in RFC before the September submission deadline.  @Sebix has continued his project for tags on the Maker forum, intending to figure out how to make them more useful, better organized, and less sprawling.   Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 03:08 In summary, headline priorities:  We\u2019ve got the ClipperCallee implementation for SushiJoin. This extends to Keepers. DssVest implementation for transferable tokens in general. There\u2019s a DssCharter for Institutional Vaults in parallel with forum post discussion coming soon. The entire team agreed to focus on the G-UNI contract and oracle work to support collateral onboarding. D3M: Direct Deposit Module - useful later when rates increase. We will focus on D3M sometime after G-UNI.  Forum Posts:  Executive Spell Postmortem posted (re: correct raising DC on RWA002-A). July Month in Review posted. Institutional and Long Term Vaults proposal posted.  Documentation:  PR checklist for external teams to add collateral to mainnet & Kovan. ChainSecurity published Optimism Dai Bridge Audit, no errors\u2026first time ever.  Layer 2:  We had a successful Optimism test spell cast on Kovan by relaying messengers across the bridge.  Other:  Sam joined the team full-time. MATIC will be up on one of the coming Executives. Reminder for Keepers: make sure your gas setup is working correctly now that the London hard fork has happened. We\u2019re laying the groundwork for the Georli transition for the testnet.   Questions:  Payton Rose: Brian mentioned that MATIC is looking pretty good for the next executive.  Chris: From our end, this is just a straightforward collateral onboarding. We are waiting on the mainnet Oracles to have enough price updates for them to be comfortable with it to go.   Chris: Also, Chainsecurity published the Optimism Dai Bride audit, and they found no errors, which was the first time that we have gone to audit without any mistakes.  Payton Rose: Congrats, quite the accomplishment. Someone: Maybe they are getting lazy, but Chainsecurity has been some of the best auditors in space, which means a lot.     Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 07:44 Posts:  We published a post that analysis how lower LR Maker Vaults could affect risk premiums for each Vault. Based on simulated results, we Suggested decreasing LRs by a maximum of 10% for second-tier Vaults, which have 175% LR, and decrease LRs by a maximum of 5% for leading Vaults such as ETH-A, renBTC-A, and UNI LP Vaults. We suggest no change in LR for ETH-B due to the OSM delay risks. Caution: fee compensation is currently low. If we decrease the LR, the spread between the risk compensation of expected loss will decrease. The surplus buffer is well set to manage this risk. However, the cost from Core Units is also increasing, and the Risk Profile Portfolio can change very fast; risk premiums can become high. The idea is to wait for community feedback to proceed with a signal poll to decrease LRs.  Offboarding Vault Types:  Began working on a plan for how to offboard unprofitable Vault types. We will likely propose a combination of decreased DCs and increased rates or LRs to force these Vaults to unwind or liquidate with a zero penalty fee. Oracles are maybe also thinking of lowering the frequency of price updates. The debt of these Vaults types in aggregate measures up to 5.5MM. However, there are plenty of smaller users utilizing it, and therefore communication is very important when we begin.  Vault Risk and Behavior:  We began working on Institutional Vault risk evaluation, which will be different since we now know the potential counterparty. It will be a report on past Vault management behavior and other characteristics. We are proceeding with the Vault user behavior dashboard. We are currently estimating how many Vault users are protecting their Vaults through DeFi saver and similar tools. We also managed to get good farming data on Dai by determining what amount of Dai debt from particular Vaults is being directly utilized for secondary lenders for liquidity mining purposes.  Risk Core Unit:  We are writing a sub proposal for MKR compensation for our Core Unit, which will be included before the deadline.   Questions:  Someone: Circling back to Institutional Vaults - does that also include the analysis of regulatory risk?  Primoz: Yes, ideally, we need a legal Core Unit or some kind of compliance. We try to cover as much as possible but can\u2019t make any promises.     Forum at a Glance  Artem Gordon 13:05 Forum at a Glance for July 30 - August 5  Discussions   Gauntlet Delegate Platform   @inkymaze, also known as Nick Cannon, from Gauntlet submitted his application as a Maker delegate to help provide risk management and parameter optimization.    Let\u2019s Talk Liquidity Rewards That Maker Is Entitled To But We Aren\u2019t Collecting   @PaperImperium starts a discussion towards potential ways for collecting unclaimed CFG liquidity rewards from the Tinlake platform.    Institutional and Long Term Vaults Proposal   @Derek and the Protocol Engineering Core Unit have put forward a proposal to create Institutional Vaults and Long-Term Vaults through a new mechanism.    Create a PAX PSM   @carlkvogel from Paxos proposed to create a PAX PSM to extend PAX as a way to diversify DAI collateral. This comes on the heels of community concern around the growth of DAI\u2019s USDC backing, which sits at 60.6% according to Daistats.com. To sweeten the deal, Paxos plans to add DAI to its platform before Q1 of 2022.    Dai on Different Networks #4   @alec from the Content Production Core Unit team provides the community an overview of DAI circulating on non-ETH blockchains, layer-2 Rollups, and various bridges.    [INFORMAL POLL] Should MakerDAO Require American Vault Owners To Also Stake Insurance Protection?   @flipflopflapdelegate asks the community whether MakerDAO should require Vault owners to have \u201cinsurance\u201d protection. He also asks if the Maker community should begin speaking with U.S. regulators about how to comply with regulatory frameworks?     Oracles Core Unit Update  Marc-Andre 17:18  This was our first week, as well as the first update coming from the Oracle Core Unit. The team is still setting up following their first week of operation. We\u2019ve been focused on the London Hardfork preparation. We\u2019ve been testing various scenarios, which have been difficult due to the gas price market. We are ready to begin pushing software updates to accommodate the new market conditions of Mempool. It may take a few days for the team to finish setting up. We are still not using the EIP 1559 transactions due to continued reliance on 3rd party software and libraries to send transactions. Unfortunately, support isn\u2019t there yet. We still are not sure exactly how the gas market will settle and proper strategies related to the gas market. We should have a better idea in due time. The MATIC oracles software and contract are ready. However, the fees are still being deployed. The deployment has been slow due to the London Hard Fork. Still on track for next week\u2019s executive. Once the dust settles with this gas fee situation, we will push to complete the rest of our work, including a handful of feeds and some layers. Besides that, everything is looking good. We began the internal road map exercises. Many interesting ideas came from the team, which are being constructed into a roadmap. This should help up prioritize hirings. More updates are coming soon!   Questions:  Payton Rose: I have a question about upgrading 1559; how long is that process?  It is probably going to be a couple of weeks; I am not sure. We do not have a due date for the libraries, especially since one of them is very dependent on those tools, which is unfortunately not supporting EIP 1559. We have another code that does not rely on those tools, and I do not know if we will push that soon, but it is a big dependency. At best, I estimate a couple of weeks. If things get weird and we see a significant saving in gas cost by going with 1559 sooner rather than later, we might try to expedite things. However, gas costs aside, things look pretty good concerning legacy transactions. I do not see any reason to rush it.     Real-World Finance Core Unit Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 23:06 July Financial Report Forum Posts:  We published a MIP for RWA Foundations. We worked with the Cayman consulters on the structure where MakerDAO can indirectly hold RWAs. It is interesting that now there is a MIP to guide the servicing companies that will manage the RWA Foundation. We are still in the process of finalizing the articles of association. We will now be able to provide additional financial reporting thanks to our new full-time hire, Mark Tyler Phillips.  Centrifuge Assets:   Centrifuge executive has passed on August 4th and contains three new RWAs, which goes live this weekend. The People\u2019s Company will take additional time to set up; it will be available within weeks or months.   Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 26:31 Growth CU Weekly Updates Stablecoins in PSM:  Paxos posted their proposal to include PAX in the PSM. Following @ultraschuppi recommendation, they are proposing similar parameters. They also will add Dai\u2019s support to their platform by the end of Q1 2022 (if not sooner), which would be a way to offer an on/off ramp for Dai. This will also allow Paxos APIs to anybody who wants to integrate Dai.  @Growth-Core-Unit recommends the community to not include any other stablecoin into the PSM unless they show interest in it and are willing to partner with the protocol. The PSM is a powerful DeFi use case for other stablecoins. We are confident that after the inclusion of PAX, others will be open for agreements with MakerDAO. Nonetheless, we will continue to respect the community\u2019s opinion even it contradicts our own.  Other:  We continue our conversations with the projects that could be offboarded. Until now, Kyber (KNC-A) is the only one who is not interested in opening a Vault to take the remaining debt.  @MarianoDP posted a MKR Valuation Report by Messari. We shared the July PnL in our weekly update found above.  Stars of the week:  Recognized digital artist Micah Johnson, Async Art, and @Growth-Core-Unit will be promoting a special day on Aug 10th, which symbolizes the adversity that people of color face in the US and the conversations around equity, diversity, and financial inclusion. Dai and Bitcoin have supported currencies that people can donate to a fund set up for the boys who will have access to on their 18th birthday. Battle Racers announce the MakerMaker ShowDAOn tournaments, another tournament in DAI alongside Community Gaming with prizes in DAI   Content Production Core Unit Update  Seth Goldfarb 33:37 Content Production Biweekly Updates Transparency Dashboard 13  We extended the art contest for another week. If you submit, please reach out on Rocketchat or Twitter and share your drawings. We\u2019re making progress on the Community Portal, including Explainer Videos and more content and design stuff in place regarding the CMS. Have been uploading videos on YouTube for Maker Relay. We split the Maker Relay into 3 sections; the State of Dai, Current Events, and Votes and Polls. We would like to hear feedback. We\u2019ve taken over the substack that Tim Black has previously managed. We are in the process of a content plan. So far, we have posted copies of Maker Relay on there. Check it out and sign up! We have been doing brand research. If you\u2019re interested in supporting the MakerDAO brand, please sign up or contact us. We will be posting an accounting update later this week.

We are very excited! A big thanks to GovAlpha and mandated actors who are part of the MakerDAO interim operating budget multi-sig. We secured 10,000 DAI in grants to help secure our funds for working during the last few months.  Agenda:  Immediate priorities are to set up tracking and documentation for all of our active projects and to hire that Engagement Lead so we can begin tackling the other portion of our mandate. We are also planning on improving current projects such as the Maker Relay. In addition, we are working on strengthening our team to submit greater quality and more punctual summaries. As we set up the Core Unit, we still haven\u2019t gotten the first disbursement or the Payroll setup. But it will happen soon within the next few weeks.  Hiring:   Hiring a full-time Engagement Lead. We prefer diversity, such as a female who is charismatic and proactive. We need to begin to engage with stakeholders at MakerDAO to give them information and gather information for ourselves.  Other:  Office hours are set to Fridays 18:00 - 18:30 UTC and are available on the public calendar.   MIPs Update  Pablo 45:46 Weekly MIPs Update  My name is Pablo, also known as @Blimpa on RocketChat and on the Forum.

David: If anybody is looking for the MIP dates and you do not know where to find them, there is a pinned topic in the forum under the MIPs category. It has the important dates for each of the upcoming three or four governance cycles.

The CT1 excludes stablecoins. It has been challenging for our surplus buffer to keep up with the growth in assets because if we risk our assets doubled today, our CET1 would just drop by half. We have to stay at a certain level of loans to start accruing equity in the surplus buffer. If you grow too quickly, your safety will lag because you need time to have those loans accruing trust. With the decrease in loan demands, you start to see that income comes in from the loans. That is why it keeps increasing. If loans double tomorrow, our ratio will go down, and time to catch back up.   David: I have a general question regarding the CT1 measure. Let\u2019s say we are in this environment where the MKR price is relatively healthy, and the other part of the CT1 ratio is growing. Still, our surplus buffer is not. Would people in the DAO be generally opposed or for slight Maker dilution to raise that surplus buffer and not necessarily rely on us purely on our revenue streams for accruing that? I am curious as to why you would be opposed or agree.  It comes down to how much risk the community governance wants to take in our safety ratios. Generally, risk has recommended higher ratios, and I think I have been pretty vocal about not wanting to burn MakerMaker while we\u2019re below the recommended ratios. I think long term, we should align as a community on what inappropriate and targeted CET1 ratio and liquidity ratio or our leverage ratio is and then just start not burning MKR when we are not at those ratios. Then that way, it is just kind of automatic. We could have certainly one-off situations where maybe the ratio is slightly low, and we think it is a good opportunity to burn some MKR; perhaps we can handle that through separate signal requests and vote, but generally, I think given how opposed people are to minting and taking the higher risk to burn MKR. I believe there is just no appetite for diluting holders to reach these appropriate risk measures.   David: We still have the 84,000 Maker that the foundation transferred to the protocol in the pause proxy. To give a little bit more context to this question: I am probably also leaning towards opposed, but my thinking is that if we go for a dilution, it usually happens when the MKR price is bottoming out, and we end up taking a really bad haircut, which is what we saw on Black Thursday right? We ended up selling a lot of MKR really low. However, if we are lagging behind our risk metric ratio and MKR price is high, it seems like it might be wise to actually try to raise cash from not purely diluted MKR but MKR that we have free like that 84,000 MKR might be an interesting tool to use. I am just thinking out loud; I do not have an opinion one way or the other.  We should probably define a targeted measure. Subs talked about the Basel requirements that banks have in terms of risk measures they must follow, so I think as a community, we should look at these, you know, work with risks, take the recommendations and then lock in what we think is appropriate. I do not know; people want to dilute to get there, but hopefully, we have time to get there before the market starts to rebound and the loan demand takes off again. S\u00e9bastien: Maybe one thing to add is that we currently have a buffer, which is great, but the main risk we face is tail risk. If you have one percent or four percent and are blacklisted on USDC or are falling like a knife, you lose everything. So having one perfect buffer or four percent does not change anything. This will make more sense in the future, where we will have more negligible risk. Still, more diversified risk, and where the buffer is essential for that, it is true that we have many tail risks, so it does not change much. Still, it is essential to think about that for the future because if we have hyper-growth, it would be difficult to raise the surplus.     B.Protocol Declaration of Intent Primer  Yaron Velner 01:10:02  2880\u00d71800 158 KB   We try to improve the liquidation process all over DeFi. We have some integration with Maker, but this is less relevant to these maps. Basically, we want to have a new collateral type backed by our liquidation system. This is a declaration of intent, so details are still flexible and could be set after this vote passes if it passes but roughly speaking, we offer to have another WBTC collateral type with a better liquidation ratio, which will allow a higher leverage ratio, the users will make liquidations more secure for this collateral type. They will give more opportunities to get higher stability fees. The system works as follows; we plan to offer some models on top of the DAI saving rate. In the future, it will be maybe more attractive yield building platforms, but let\u2019s start with the DSR so users will deposit to the protocol it will go to the DSR, some change in the dog will be done so whenever bite is called a B.Protocol, I will try to get the DAI from the deposits of the user, will use it for the liquidation and then the main novelty we offer is a rebalancing algorithm in which the is sold automatically back to DAI. Then it will eventually go back to the idle pool to the DSR. The rebalance algorithm takes some combination of price feed and the V1 formula, so this is a taste. There is a discussion on the forum, present to small details next week. In general, we appreciate any feedback on the forum from different teams.   Questions:  Christopher Mooney: Whenever this bite happens, there would be this alternate path in the dog, maybe it would be a bite. Still, I think it is a bark right now. Then when that happens, I assume we do this kind of\u2026 Let\u2019s call it a curve rebalancing, right? Is there a point at which we exit that entirely and just throw the collateral out for liquidation because we are afraid this rebalancing is no longer working? Is there a pressure relief valve there?  Yarn: From an MKR point of view is like a kind of an external system to make it right, so if you have pressure, it will just offer a higher discount, but from your perspective, you do not really care about the balanced profits or lost society, you only care that the liquidation was successfully executed, but there are some discussions in the forum that for example, because of battery balance the idle balance reduces or decreases the ceiling of this collateral type. This way, we can have some risk management system because eventually the DAI collateral will decrease the DAI in the DSLR, will fall only upon liquidation, which by definition means that the debt gets smaller so we can have an auto adjustment that if there is not too much collateral damage in the DSLR because of battery balancing, then we can lower the ceiling automatically so there could be some mitigations. There are more details that I didn\u2019t mention, we expect that the bite or the bark we just dump it with some flat discount or 5%, we did some simulations, and we did it not on D% but actually on Binance futures liquidation and depends on many parameters, but we simulated 1 billion monthly liquidations, overall this seems quite profitable   David: I had one question about multiple PSMs. I remember early on in the conversation, I think it was like Chris Mooney or somebody was detailing what was called a vampire attack where if there are two PSMs, basically the issuer would have undue power to shift all of the balance to other PIPs; I cannot remember the exact details honestly - had a hard time wrapping my head around it but is that like a valid concern? Was it invalidated? I am curious what that was.  Christopher Mooney: Because of the reserve allocation that Paxos does because they are a regulated stable coin or at least their backing is regulated under New York law, they cannot do this. Part of the attack that sort of requires or necessary for the attack to work was that you would need the people at Pax to actually have to issue new Pax or, like it was, GUSD because NGOC is in the same situation, they would issue a new Pax or new GUSD. They would put it into their PSM, get a bunch of DAI, and push the DAI one to one through the USDC PSM. Now they have got a bunch of USDC and what they do is they leave their collateral backed by USDC, and they begin a claim for the actual US dollars through Circle. I think I do not know this for sure. I am guessing that this attack would be illegal or would not be complying because of how the collateral backing is regulated. So the vampire attack is less likely to happen that way. Christopher Mooney: Interestingly, it may not be out of compliance for USDC or Tether to make this attack because they do not have that same strong regulatory backing. In theory, they actually could be vampire attack the PSMS in the other direction. Still, at this point, we could easily cap USDC because we do not need any more exposure there. That was the vampire attack, if you had any other questions about it. The precondition was basically that they can mint without backing in some unregulated way. Still, because Paxos and others like GSDRs are strongly regulated, there is not much risk, so it makes sense to do multiple PSMs; this is the gist, yes.

DssCharter for Institutional Vaults in parallel with forum post discussion. G-UNI contract and oracle work to support collateral onboarding.

MATIC will be up on one of the coming Executives.   Risk  Published a post that analysis how lower LR Maker Vaults could affect risk premiums for each Vault. Suggested to decrease LRs by 10% for second-tier Vaults and increase LRs by 5% for first-tier vaults. Began working on a plan for how to offboard unprofitable Vault types. Will likely propose a combination of decreased DCs and increased LRs. Proceeding with Vault user behavior dashboard. We also managed to get good farming data on Dai. We are writing a sub proposal for MKR compensation for our Core Unit.   Oracles  This is our first week operating. We are still in the setup phase. We\u2019ve been focused on the London Hardfork prep. Testing various scenarios, which has been difficult due to the gas price market. Pushing updates to accommodate the new market conditions. Still not using the EIP 1559 transactions because we are still relying on 3rd party software and libraries. Unfortunately, support isn\u2019t there yet. MATIC oracles software and contract are ready. However, the fees are still being deployed. Still on track for next week\u2019s executive. Began the talent search internally. Many interesting ideas came from the team, which is being constructed into a roadmap.   Real-World Finance Real-World Finance Core Unit Report  Centrifuge executive was passed yesterday. It will contain three new RWAs, which will be live this weekend. The public Vaults will be available within the following weeks. Published MIP for RWA Foundations. Still in the process of finalizing. We will now be able to provide additional financial reporting with the new full-time hire, Mark Tyler Phillips.   Growth Growth CU weekly update  Paxos posted their proposal to include PAX in the PSM. They speak about including DAI in their platform, which would be a way to offer an on/off ramp for DAI. Recommending the community to not include any more stablecoins. We should wait for the Paxos proposal to complete. Collateral offboarding conversations continue. Mariano posted a MKR valuation report from Messari on the forum. Stars of the week uses Bitcoin and Dai donations to support young underprivileged boys. Sponsoring a Battle Races game that will be issuing an NFT containing a Maker limited edition branding. We shared July\u2019s PnL in our weekly update.   Content Production Content Production Bi-Weekly Update: July 22 to August 4, 2021  Extended the art contest for another week. Making progress on the Community Portal, including explainer videos and more content in places such as scripts and storyboards. Have been uploading videos on YouTube for Maker Relay. We would like to hear feedback. Taken over the substack that Tim Black has previously managed. Have posted copies of Maker Relay on there. Check it out and sign up! Have been doing brand research. If you\u2019re interested in supporting the MakerDAO brand, please sign up or contact us. Will be posting an accounting update later this week.   Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling  Finished the forecast and reporting template for DogFooding Products, which is available in the SES public folder. We\u2019ve released the MKR compensation template. We\u2019re looking for an analyst/entry-level intern. KYM Session with B.Protocol Declaration of Intent will be on August 11th.   Governance Communications  Our immediate priorities are to set up tracking and documentation for all of our active projects and to hire that Engagement Lead so we can begin tackling the other portion of our mandate. We are setting up the CU; we still haven\u2019t gotten the first disbursement or the Payroll setup. But it will happen soon (next 1-2 weeks) Our office hours are set to Fridays 1800-1830 UTC and are available on the public calendar. We are hiring a full-time Engagement Lead.   MIPs MIPs Update #47  Other Presentations and Updates  July Financials  Decreasing interest income due to lower loan demand and stability fees. USDC is equal to or greater than DAI conversion fees due to the reduction of crypto loans. Lower crypto volatility driving less liquidation income. Workforce expenses are negative for the month but should improve as more Core Units emerge. ETH dependency is flat at 83% compared to the prior month. USDC inflow decreased as crypto loans stabilize. Balance sheet continues to grow thanks to liquidity reserves. Liquidation business fell significantly. On-chain DAI lagged compared to the general crypto market. Market share on-chain volume is stable. CET1 ratio (risk-weighted assets) increasing faster than risk exposure due to Surplus Buffer increase and continued deleveraging. MKR earnings yield went down last few months. RWAs grew by 45% to ~4.5M this month! Liquidity pool growth doubled, which was mainly driven by the DAIUSDC Vault.   B.Protocol Declaration of Intent Primer  We would like to improve liquidation and LR for WBTC-B and have higher SFs. We plan to offer a module on top of the DSR. \u200b Our KYM call is on August 11th at 4 PM UTC.  ",

My name is LongForWisdom. I am the Governance Facilitator at MakerDAO. We have got some regular updates from the usual suspects. We are going to try to initiate a discussion on institutional Vaults. This has been a topic that has been discussed over the last couple of weeks. We like people to get involved; we like people asking questions and commenting, so please, do not be shy if you have something to say.   Weekly Updates  Governance  LongForWisdom 01:27  Last week\u2019s Executive has yet to pass. I think it is currently 36.000 MKR supporting out of 70.000 on the previous hats. There is still a little way to go. Hopefully, we will see that go through in the next few days. A quick reminder, we have the month of June\u2019s ratification polls for MIPs as part of the monthly governance cycle now live for the next ten days; they went up on Monday, so please vote on those if you have not already. We recently changed the monthly governance cycle such that these polls were the only requirement for proposals to be ratified. Therefore this is your chance; there is no executive after this in the absence of technical changes; please vote if you have not. We also had a couple of other polls this week as part of the usual weekly cycle. We had three SushiSwap LP onboarding polls which passed. That was, I believe, for the ETH-LINK, YFI-ETH, and AAVE-ETH pairs. Those all passed, which is great. We had a couple of dust parameter polls as well. One proposes moving the dust parameter from 5.000 DAI to 10.000 DAI. The dust parameter is also known as the minimum debt floor, which is the minimum amount of DAI that someone can withdraw from a Maker Vault. We had an ETH-B specific dust parameter poll which moved ETH-B dust from 15.000 to 30.000 DAI. Both of those passed as well. When it comes to this week\u2019s executive, assuming that last week\u2019s one passes and they are not blocked, we should include the dust changes I just described. However, I will wait for Smart Contracts to confirm that it will also enable the flash mint module, which has been in the queue for a while.   GovAlpha Core Unit update 04:00 GovAlpha Weekly Update  We recently posted in the forum an onboarding post, essentially describing some things people can get up to in GovAlpha, and requesting anyone interested in working with us to get in touch. If that is something you are interested in, please get in touch with me. Another thing I am going to say regarding GovAlpha is that we are approaching three months since we got a budget, and we will be doing a quarterly review post at the end of June. It will be fairly long and comprehensive. I look forward to that in the next couple of weeks. This past week we have been putting out fires a little bit alongside the usual recurring commitments. Not too much to report, I am afraid.   Forum at a Glance  Prose 05:21  One announcement that you may not have noticed is that the Risk Core Unit has added even more features to the dashboard. I have a feeling Primoz will want to brag about those a little bit in his segment. First, however, there are links if you want to get on there.  Forum at a Glance for June 11th - 17th  Three-Point Summary  The peg holds as more USDC flows in through the PSM (Peg Stability Module), currently topping $2.5B We have spent a whole week above 5B DAI in circulation! DAI Liquidity is quite strong, with slippage rates under 5 basis points for trades above 10,000 DAI. Historic slippage showing strength as well.   Discussions   Real World Assets May Report  An update on the state of RWA has caused quite a stir in the community. There is a lot to learn in this thread, but a reminder to engage assuming good faith and in the spirit of collaboration.    What is stopping us from investing in the PSM USDC?  A discussion on deploying the USDC capital from the USDC-PSM-A facility, I recommend checking out a prior post on Balance Sheet Manipulation as well.    Marketing Maker   @Planet_X brings forward some questions on the state of marketing at MakerDAO and discusses how we can coordinate our efforts between Core Units.     Signal Requests   tin/tout parameters for new PSMs   @ultraschuppi follows up on a previous Signal, asking the community if they support the Open Market Committee 2 making decisions on the tin and tout (Fee in and out) for incoming PSM vault types while asking the community for their input on the initial Debt Ceilings.    Adjusting ttl on flap-auctions   @ultraschuppi back at it with the signal plans  Here proposing a change in the duration to surplus auctions, Signal ends June 24th. Seth Goldfarb: In regards to the marketing Maker thread that Peyton mentioned, we will be having a discussion about that on Monday. There are some details in the thread; if anybody is interested in joining, please feel free.     Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 08:56  In development this week, we have got the Direct Deposit module. This is a final PR taking into account the global settlement considerations. Then the big one is the Flash Mint Module which earlier this week was deployed to Kovan. I encourage anybody if you get a chance to play with the Flash Mint Module on Kovan. I think I am going to switch gears and play with that for the afternoon. These are also lovingly referred to as recreational nukes. The Flash Mint is a big deal; it is maybe more like a nuclear power plant. It will add many capabilities to arbitrage the peg in different locations or have enough Dai liquidity on hand for arbs to just go in and work out peg issues. It also gives us this native toolkit to do a bunch of cool stuff where people can rebalance Vaults of one type with another type and stuff like that. There is a lot of obviously pretty cool things that can be done with it. It is a pretty big deal; everyone should take a look. For delegate voting, we are waiting on some feedback from the delegates regarding whether or not delegates should expire. Then there has been much work on the SushiJoin adapter. We are ensuring that it behaves correctly under an emergency shutdown. We are also dealing with auctions for the SushiJoin adapter and ensuring that rewards are appropriately distributed. Lots of work in that area. - As far as DSSVest, work wrapped up on that module, and DSS interfaces took some changes for the DSSFlash. In reviews, we have some of the clipper-specific stuff for the CropJoin. There is a factory for deploying flip. I think it is clip and join, which is a more detailed technical nuance. We are working with BlockScience to improve formal modeling skills. We are also engaged with them and experimenting with their tooling. Finally, there has been much research on the Oracle tail risk mitigations. This is the case where the Oracle team puts a ton of work into making sure that we do not ingest bad prices, and Liq 2.0 has us leaning on some of that work. We added minor mitigation in the ClipperMom to trip the breaker on liquidations if the Oracle price changes by too large a delta between updates. However, we think that for proper defense-in-depth, we will add maybe a little bit of extra stuff there. There is just research happening with regards to that. For L2, the Optimism team changed a bunch of their token standards. We have a vast PR accommodating those changes. Moreover, we are engaged with Sertora using their tooling to do formal verification and proofs. All of that is coming along; it is just that even the API or the framework that we are targeting is kind of a moving target on us. It is a little bit tricky. Then for discussions, I think we have been discussing with the Growth Core Unit about institutional Vaults. There will probably be some discussions about that later. Also, we have had scaling-related discussions with SES. We have been talking about their sandbox and scaling models and seeing what areas PE can hand to SES to create safe sandboxes and incubate engineers to work on the protocol. Also, I think Brian is working with Oracle to give them an instant access module for authorizations to whitelist readers against the medianizer and the oracle. Aside from that, does anyone else on the PE team have something that I forgot that they want to mention? Finally, I should say I have been working a little bit on making sure the auction demo keepers are also functioning correctly, so there is some keeper work. Does anyone have any questions?   Questions  David Utrobin: Can you repeat that last bit about the keeper work happening?  Chris: There is this auction-demo-keeper repository, and the point of that repository is that it is a backstop keeper. It is supposed to be a reference implementation. It started as a reference implementation, but we want it to be a backstop keeper for the protocol. That way, in an insane liquidation event, the hope is that any member of the community could spin this, clone this repo, put a private key in it, point it at a node, and start the thing up. It will give it a little F, do the authorizations, and start flash loaning the collateral and then handling liquidations under Liq 2.0. That is the point of the repo. Any other questions? LongForWisdom: Has the Flash Mint Module been audited? Does it need auditing? I know it is quite a small thing, so maybe it does not. Chris: It has not gone through any formal audit. Well, I do not think so; if we did, it might have been around the end of last year, but I do not think we did. SamM: No. It has not. However, it does not need it. It is dead simple. We have had multiple reviews from the team. It is safe. Chris: We have looked at it and tried to think about what is capable, and Sam brings up a good point in chat which is that there is a kind of lindy effect around the DC that we are thinking of giving it, which is around half a billion because you can get that from a Dai flash loan or flash loans around that amount from other places. We do not feel like we are adding anything to the ecosystem that would be too dangerous. Brian McMichael: Flash loans caught us by surprise. It has just been standard practice to build around that and account for mass amounts of liquidity. Frank Cruz: Chris, looking at an institutional Vault, have you guys looked at any KYC and AML third-party providers in case that is required? Chris: Not the PE team but maybe Business Development, or Growth, or somebody has looked at that. However, right now, I think the institutional Vaults we have been looking at are not at that scale. They are already crypto-native institutions, so I do not think there is a KYC requirement right now. Nadia: Yes. I agree with you. We have been talking with a few because we know with whom AAVE will work, and it will be easy to onboard them on the process. Still, at least at this stage, we are on the first steps of creating institutional Vaults; the polls will be managed by Nexo and other similar companies that we already know. I do not think we need a KYCA company in the middle. What we will need, and it is what I wrote in the post, is a deep analysis of the financial statements and everything related to Nexo in this case or any other institution that wants to have this kind of Vaults because, in that sense, the Risk team will have to analyze not just the collaterals but also the institution that will own the Vault. BrianMcMichael: We forgot to mention also that I did a permission Gemjoin adapter earlier this week. Therefore we do have a prototype of a joint adapter that could be used to whitelist individual parties if we need to go that route. Kurt Barry: I would say, in general, the blockage on this is not engineering complexity. It is fairly straightforward to build some permission into stuff or build, say, fixed rates. I think it is more about the risk management and scalability concerns more than anything.     Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 20:09  We have been setting up the Core Unit. The poll for the Oracle Core Unit is also live right now. I think it has been up for four days, and it runs for two weeks total. Go vote on that; whether you approve or disapprove, it does not matter; go vote. We are continuing work on the stETH oracle. I still have not entirely decided whether we will use the contracts that they wrote or whether we are just going to go with a feed-based approach. If we did use their contracts, we would deploy our instance because theirs is upgradable, and we do not want to take on any of that risk if we were to go that route. Still undecided, but it sounds like we are getting closer to a solution. I am also talking to a couple more potential light feeds. That will be interesting. I do not think we have onboarded any light feeds in quite some time. I cannot share any names yet, but you should see some proposals pop up in the forum fairly soon. The last thing is that you should vote on the executive because we have many yEARN whitelisting proposals for the Oracle to do delegated vaults, which gets our oracles used more. Still, the delegated vaults inject yEARN TBL for those tokens into Maker. They can borrow Dai and then put that DAI in there and their Dai into their Dai kind of Vault. We could see a pretty significant uptick from the UNI, LINK, AAVE, and I think the last one is COMP, from those Vaults. Let us see what happens there.   Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 23:15  The update will be brief today because we are mainly occupied with three larger collateral evaluations: stETH, D3M, and Polygon. We want to have the stETH evaluation complete by next week. We need another few weeks to finish the others. As promised, we posted the SP-SUSHI-ETH and xSUSHI risk evaluations. We also added new sections to our risk dashboard mentioned by Payton. It now shows the auction statistics and everyday performance. In addition, there are now interactive simulations for MKR loan losses. Another page now features all of our forum posts, including all past parameter changes and proposals. You can visit at maker.blockanalitica.com. Feedback is appreciated.   Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 25:18  Three-point update today: The first is NewSilver regarding the executive summary issue. I will publish a post soon, but we are working on a solution. To summarize, it was an option for the asset originator to change the executive summary, more or less the terms of the agreement. There were two changes: One of the drop APR does not affect us anyway, and the other one was a change to the metrics to know if a loan can be accepted or not in the pool, which was 85% LTV and now up to 90% LTC lump cost. We will focus on NewSilver tomorrow evening. I will place a link to the call. You will be able to ask any question to NewSilver and understand why the change was made. However, the issue is that we should, at least, have the opportunity to discuss the changes, and we did not because maybe I got an email, but I did not act on it, or I did not get an email. I do not know precisely what happened. I am still looking for the post mortem on it. As far as the solution to move forward, we will add a mandator that has already acted previously. However, upon the actor, we have a notification list, and we make sure that everyone on this list gets an email before changing the parameters. We will have a period where if we liquidate the Vault, no change in the executive summary can be done until we have exited all the positions, no matter if it takes one week, one day, or one year. We will always keep the same terms until we exit. We are still working a lot on onboarding law firms. Currently, we are in talks with three law firms. One in the Cayman Islands and two in the US advise us on all the RWA topics, one of the significant components of the new budget on vote currently for the RWF team. As a new Core Unit currently, we do not have any budget for that. I am using part of the budget for something else to pay for the lawyer because I gather it is more important right now. It is 20.000 DAI per month on the legal stuff for the next budget, but most likely, that would not be enough, so I will have to take it from somewhere else inside my budget. The last point that I think is essential to note. We are also working on the SolarX Cayman Trust Structure. SolarX is a solar farm in the state of New York. The point of this project is that the closing should happen next month more or less because obviously, the guys need to add the credit line to buy the land from the owner and start all the audits and the construction of the solar farm. I just wanted to note that the only reason why we might move fast on this topic is that on our team, we have Christian that is working on that. He was head of legal for a 16 billion LNG project, and it is not like every day we have someone that did something way more significant than what we do currently. That is why I think it is a good opportunity for Maker to move on this topic. Then the whole team will take a vacation. Does anyone have any questions?  Brian McMichael: I just want to mention that Maker Governance should probably look into the history of Solyndra, which tried to build a solar farm in Nevada and ended up spending about 700 million dollars of US government money before they went bust. I do not want to make a big deal about it personally, but I think there is some precedent behind things like this.     Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 30:47 Growth CU Weekly Updates  We began conversations with our partners in El Salvador. One of them is actively working with the government and creating educational campaigns. They did approve Bitcoin, but it is not a very crypto-friendly country as of yet. These people want to assist merchants with local crypto payment integration and help ramp up this crypto acceptance phase. In addition, they want to attract tourists who would like to buy real estate through Bitcoin. We have two approaches: one being through retail users, which will require much explaining about Bitcoin and Dai, which would be very tedious. So instead, we can create an educational campaign for retail users who live in El Salvador. Another approach is to help partners launch a solution for merchants that can easily convert BTC to Dai. The government is also a potential approach but will be difficult because we need to propose using Bitcoin in exchange for Dai loans. If this works, it would be a fantastic use case. However, the government and retail do not understand Dai, and lots of education would be required with almost any approach we take. The Sovryn Bridge went live! It accepts Dai from the ETH Mainnet or BSC to RSK Networking using the Babelfish protocol, which will be live very soon. Also, @Gustav_Arentoft and I are going to be speaking at EthCC. We will be cover things from the roadmap foundation and the DAO. Gustav will be speaking about RWAs in the Maker Protocol. Once we have more details on what time we present, we will let you know.   Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling  Juan Guill\u00e9n 35:36  Quick update from us, we have been doing a lot on the admin side, which will be reflected on our document later. Anyone can spin up a core unit if they want to. We keep having these talks with very interesting teams to join the incubator, and I am looking forward to sharing details later.   1502\u00d7836 90.3 KB   1516\u00d7844 76.4 KB   There\u2019s this thing that I have not put in here yet because I wanted to make a better presentation. I think Chris already announced it. We are working with the PE team to work on the project sandbox. So we will be giving more information about that soon.   1510\u00d7862 86.3 KB   1514\u00d7852 107 KB   Questions  Frank Cruz: Juan, what is the total count for the number of incubates?  Juan Guill\u00e9n: Right now, we have two that have already started. That is dTalent, which is three people, the other editor and Natalie. Then we have the DUX, five people if I am not wrong, so so far, it is eight. Frank Cruz: No, sorry, I meant how many possible Core Units are you incubating? Juan Guill\u00e9n: We have a budget, and we also can help other teams, so in some cases, we are helping projects that want to spin their Core Unit informally, and we help them navigate governance. However, we are expecting to onboard maybe two more teams. We believe that these two Core Units, dTalent, and DUX, will be quite fast in general. Maybe in four months, they will be up and running, and all set up to start focusing on other groups and core units.     MIPs Update  David Utrobin 40:40 Weekly MIPs Update  1087\u00d7606 73.8 KB    1083\u00d7604 242 KB   1079\u00d7595 545 KB   1092\u00d7605 111 KB   1082\u00d7601 133 KB   1083\u00d7598 251 KB   1082\u00d7594 174 KB   1084\u00d7597 169 KB   1085\u00d7603 120 KB   1087\u00d7598 150 KB   1084\u00d7593 102 KB   Questions  Juan: You left out the GovAlpha Budget Modification.  David: Dang it! Sorry. Yes, this budget modification was posted by a non-team member of GovAlpha. As a MIP Editor, I posted my opinion that this should be proposed by either the facilitator or a member of GovAlpha. Therefore, the GovAlpha team was allowed to take over this proposal or allow the non-team member to follow it. Essentially, we decided not to assign it an SP number; it is now determined as a signal for what the community is looking to expect and GovAlpha\u2019s next budget update. This was a unique situation being the first of its kind.     Open Discussion  Institutional Vaults, Permissionless Access, and Managing Large Vaults 47:46  LongForWisdom: We are hoping to spin up a discussion around in vaults and get an understanding of how the community feels about this.  Nadia: This trend with institutional Vaults began because we initiated conversations with the largest users. We wanted to understand why they are not deploying more capital into these Vaults. We wanted any feedback about the MKR protocol. We spoke with Nexo and Primoz. What we understood was these user\u2019s amount of capital and what they like. We decided that we need to provide better terms for this kind of user. At the same time, we are seeing other DeFi projects that are thinking of having institutional products that contain KYC, separate pools, and permission solutions. It is a good next step for us to begin thinking about these things. These actions will allow us to open larger Vaults on ETH, BTC, and collaterals. However, we have to understand what it takes; should we take permission or permissionless method? What are the technical and security implications for our decisions? We spoke with the Protocol Engineering Core Unit. They have a model that will allow us to propose a whitelisted Vault containing preferential terms for a couple of different institutions to begin working on a product for institutional users. There is more information in this post here. Christopher Mooney: There was much back and forth when we discussed this. We were not sure if this should be permitted or permissionless. Permissionless is a cherished attribute within this blockchain economy we have been building. I was resistant to the idea of whitelisted Vaults. However, we need to understand the pragmatic point of view that our protocols will offer better rates and help increase our Dai supply. I hope to take these institutional Vaults and whitelist one of their addresses, giving them access to basic risk terms. We review and attempt to figure out how to offer all users a permissionless method to appeal to other users. Whenever an institution asks us, we should figure out how to provide that to the masses. Otherwise, we will end up creating a new traditional finance system bringing up back to zero. Also, RWA is all permissioned Vaults, which we need to figure out to make it permissionless.   Kurt Barry: What are the terms that these institutions want? How do they differ from other Ethereum users today?  Primoz Kordez: Permission Vaults makes sense because it allows direct communication similarly to RWA. We want to know the balance sheet and unwinding procedure of borrowers. Through this, we can offer better terms. Most terms that institutions are after want a lower LR and low fees. This means that they would mint more to have a buffer against being liquidated. However, this alone is not enough to have everything from direct communication with them. Once we can understand their technical actions, it would become much safer for us to offer better terms. On the other hand, through permissionless Vaults, we can only see on-chain activity and hope that each user is safe for the Protocol. Lucas Vogelsang: At that point, by underwriting the credit risk, we are getting into the issue of ensuring any recourse against the business outside of what is locked up in the Vault. Do we want to simply rely on institutional reputation? Primoz Kordez: No, we are not talking about below 100% CR. We are thinking about 130% CR or a little lower with special capacity and fixed rates. The terms would be a huge benefit. One of our ideas was to implement origination fees and low SFs to guarantee that they will be long-term users. However, we do need to study how this idea works with borrowers. Christopher Mooney: There is an opportunity cusp. This will not be a widespread thing that we will be doing for every Vault. We will have a threshold for how much of this stuff we will be doing. We need time to expand L2 as well as other things. Kurt Barry: Permissionlessness is good. We are not getting rid of the existing permissionless offerings that we have. This is just a way to use very specific permissioning for a small part of the system to generate more Dai supply. This is naturally a good thing as long as Dai itself remains permissionless. There are concerns about scalability versus the use of time. We should choose a smaller number of high-quality relationships with institutions. Overall, these decisions can produce a net positive for Maker.   Tim Schuppener: I am split between opinions. Permissionlessness is something that I cherish within the blockchain space. However, I do understand that have agreements and terms with institutions can prove to be very helpful. For example, we had many discussions concerning ETH-B Vault low LR. We finally continued with raising the DC. Through this experience, I believe that we cannot offer institutions lower than 130% CR if we want to keep the one-hour oracle delay. However, maybe they do not even need it. If they are professionals at managing their positions, they may be confident with just ten minutes.  Kurt Barry: The primary purpose of the oracle delay is to protect the system from an oracle attack. Nik Kunkel: We use this hour to perform an Emergency Governance Vote to \u2018unfuck\u2019 the system. Kurt Barry: The hour delay also helps to prevent liquidations. It just comes with the package. Nik Kunkel: NOnetheless, it is all about Vault management. When you have an open, permissionless Vault and do not know the users\u2019 experience level, we must provide them that hour from a risk perspective. If you look at the YFI Vault, which mostly contains yEarn, they are borderline under overcollateralized and have always been covered. Tim Schuppener: Yes, however, we were not able to agree or find consensus on making them a special deal considering they have a track record of everything- Nik Kunkel: Nexo does the same thing. They all have the same track record. Christopher Mooney: They are slightly different; yEarn is also monetizing. It is treasuring instead of putting collateral assets. There is a bit of danger with yEarn that turned some people off. Tim Schuppiner: I agree, there is more risk involved with the yEarn Vaults. However, we do not have any guarantee. We just have their track record but no method of punishing them if they happen to fail us. With an LR under 130%, how much of a market drop can we survive without them being liquidated? Nik Kunkel: They are still significantly overcollateralized. Primoz Kordez: Nexo is maintaining 400 to 500% CR. They are protected against more than 50% drops. They can also mint more. Tim Schuppiner: So they are not planning to go near 130%? Primoz Kordez: That depends on our agreement. I do not believe they want to be so close to the LR. Nik Kunkel: It would be nice to split the CR into two components: one is the lowest amount you can mint, the other is much lower relating to liquidation. Tim Schuppener: I discussed this half a year ago. Sam even made an addition to the Liq 2.0 repository. Christopher Mooney: If we want to add that into Liq 2.1, we need to consider that right now. Nik Kunkel: It is a best of both worlds; You do not have this liquidation risk and address the capital efficiency problem.   Lucas Vogelsang: Lev said that longer oracle delays would be the preferential treatment we can offer that can achieve the same thing. We can expand it to two hours so that they can get closer to the collateralization ratio. If this works well, we may not even need to provide a lower limit.  Nik Kunkel: Can you elaborate? That sounds very risky. A one-hour delay is theoretically a put option hedging against the price drop. Increasing that delay results in increasing the \u2018value\u2019 of that \u2018put option.\u2019 Lev: Your idea would play very well because you potentially do not have this extra put option. It is also not out of the question to have legal recourse for these positions. There is some blended risk involving credit risk, which you manage by managing the DC for those positions. From a market perspective, our biggest weakness is our strict collateral terms. Other projects offer much better terms than us, which attracts institutions. We need to think about oracle delay, initial maintenance, and credit risk. We have a massive advantage in terms of rates but are offset by this disadvantage in collateral terms. Lucas VovelSang: I agree, Nick. It is not preferable over the maintenance ratio. This would just be a method to offer more flexibility. Nik Kunkel: Okay, it sounds reasonable. Does anyone know how complex it would be to split the CR into two components? Brian McMichael: It is not that complex. We already have a PR for it but came in a little late, so we ended up slating it for Liq 2.1. LongForWisdom: Is this something you can do separately from Liq 2.1? Brian McMichael: Possibly, but it would make things much more complicated. Kurt Barry: This is in the realm of possibility and should not take much time.   Nik Kunkel: Regarding recourse with legal agreements, who is the counterparty on the Maker side?  Lucas Vogelsang: If you figure out a trust that all the RWA projects want to use, it could work. It is complicated but should work. Christopher Mooney: These Vaults never discussed legal recourse because we planned them to be over collateralized. The parameters would not be set for easy liquidation. Nadia: We were going to post a proposal, but now I do not think we need to incorporate a company for legal agreements. I may be wrong. LongForWisdom: Lev has left, but he believes we can get far without legal recourse. Christopher Mooney: Eventually, we will have other structures with RWA. Once we find a reliable one, we will lean on that.   LongForWisdom: It would be nice to provide this in a scalable way as well, where we can have one permissioned Vault with favorable parameters. It would be hard to please everyone with one Vault, but if Nexo works it out, we may have people come to us and ask for similar results.  Brian McMichael: We already have too many projects, and tokens backlogged that we are trying to process and come up with a good method for meeting client demands. LongForWisdom: We can coalesce around a few variants to not be an individual thing per person. We can offer three options to pick from. Brian McMichael: If we gave options with higher dust limits, for example, we would lean towards a safer permissionless solution. However, we would not be able to look at their balance sheets and CR history. LongForWisdom: I know we discussed the dust option. Primoz Kordez: We can set the dust high during onboarding, but then we need to lower it because there are many risks involved if the maintenance is high, which may not allow us to make partial repayments. You can lower the dust after onboarding. The DC must stay above 0. Frank Cruz: From a compliance perspective, is there any downside if hypothetically Nexos has a client that brought in \u2018unauthorized\u2019 money into the Vaults? Primoz Kordez: That is a question for the Legal Core Unit. Frank Cruz: Okay, Nadia, can you give an update from that Circle meeting? Nadia: It is today within a few hours. Christopher Mooney: There is probably a permissionless way to ensure that vaults have enough outstanding debt where liquidation was painful enough so that they were self-incentivized to manage it. There may be ways to create a similar deal for prominent players. Brian McMichael: I just realized that we might be able to do this more efficiently with a minimum requirement on join but keep the dust low in the system.

Welcome to the MakerDAO Governance and Risk meeting #136 taking place on Thursday, April 8th at 17:00 UTC. My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the Governance facilitator for MakerDAO.  Last week\u2019s executive is yet to pass, and it is tied to the topic I\u2019ll be bringing up later. Regarding polls this week, we had the surplus buffer poll to increase the system surplus buffer, which passed for the 25 burn option. This will move to an executive once the buffer is nearly complete. We will soon see action on that in an executive. We had a poll for appointing DeFi Saver as an Oracle Light Feed, which passed. We are not quite ready yet to put this into an executive. We need to work on a DeFi Saver setup. We had a poll confirming the Link-A Liquidations 2.0 Parameters, which also passed. This may not make it into the executive this week, neither. On the bright side, this week\u2019s executive should include onboarding NewSilver, which is the first Centrifuge asset that we\u2019ve considered onboarding. The Governance Core Unit continued working with onboarding Payton and Elihu into the various things a Governance Facilitator does. We have been working with SourceCred to cover the grants and the payouts considering that Gov Alpha is taking from that instead of the Foundation\u2019s grants program. We spend a lot of time at the end of last week on the Liquidations 2.0 parameter documentation. We managed to mostly finish it. Suppose you are confused as to what any of the parameters in Liquidations 2.0 mean. In that case, you can take a look at the description on the Community Portal. It will be linked in polls and executives. Work continues on the MIP\u2019s portal to standardize its content and to tidy things up. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.    Weekly Updates  Forum at a Glance  Elihu 04:25 Forum at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated.

Discord chat   @iammeeoh proposes launching a MakerDAO Discord channel.     Smart Contracts Team Update  Christopher Mooney 07:02  We have not done any work on the collateral onboarding priority sheet. We sent Naz to review all the items on the sheet. He added entries that we will sort and prioritize. Also, there were no collateral assessments this week, but we do have PAX-G on Kovan. Please review and use it. We sent out NS2-DRP, which was the MIP22 collateral that we were about to push on to Kovan. We will be updating the end contract as part of Liquidations 2.0. There is a potential change to vow that will be coming next year. Both of them need to be changed by the manager. We also changed the name of the token from NS2-DRP to RWA002. We deployed all of the MIP22 Centrifuge NewSilver contracts to the main net yesterday with the token ID and everything else we need. Now the spell that will execute that and put it on the protocol is being crafted; that\u2019s another significant milestone. Expect a release on Friday. We optimized MegaPoker and there\u2019s some audit checking and PRs for LP token Oracle contracts. I don\u2019t know if the complete audit is complete. Regarding Liquidations 2.0, we slid dates out by one more week. The main net release will now be next Friday. We want to make sure that things are safe before deployment. The spell itself looks good, and hopefully, we will deploy it on to Kovan today. Last week, we completed the ESM and Ilk registry updates. The spell is technically complete. It\u2019s in review, as well as the Dss interfaces. We\u2019re also working on the MIP45 Kovan description. We\u2019re waiting on PWC to review the changes that we\u2019re making to the MIP. We\u2019re going to construct an audit debrief to get the audits and discuss with the community concerning actions we took, did not take, and why things will land in the forums at some point. We\u2019re waiting on security.makerdao for the audit reports to be posted. There\u2019s PR of it with a couple of other reports, and I think we\u2019re waiting to hear from PWC before posting their reports. They are a big auditing firm. It is not a typical action for PWC to publicly release audits. We\u2019re trying to bring them into the 21st century, and they are trying to accommodate us. There are no updates on Optimism L2 this week. There are an exciting forum post and announcement on MIP50 d3m. Sam will briefly speak about it.  Sam: Yesterday, I introduced MIP50, which is the direct deposit module. So this allows the Maker to directly inject Dai liquidity into secondary markets. It\u2019s a cool addition to act as a decentralized bank and provide liquidity to secondary markets. It\u2019s a shift, and people will vote for their opinion, but I think it\u2019s an interesting proposal from Aave.   Christopher: There is background work happening in the community concerning the OKRs and that Derek has been working on.  BrianMcMichael: There have been many ancillary contracts that we noticed when preparing the spell for MIP45, which need to be updated. It\u2019s cans of worms that come one after another. Christopher: We just need to be safe.     Oracle Team Update  Nik Kunkel 14:55   The DeFi Saver Light Feed polling vote passed. It\u2019s not going to go into this Friday\u2019s executive because we need to set up the feed infrastructure on their end. It should go into the executive next week. I want to thank the Smart Contracts team, especially Kurt, for helping us get the finalized changes and responses to the ABDK audit for the UniSwap LP Oracle. ABDK uses that to compile a finalized publishable report. Hopefully, we can get that out soon. At that point, we would also redeploy the existing UniSwap LP Oracles to conform to the changes that were made. Most of which were styling-based changes, but there were also some significant gas improvements. We made 12% gains on gas relative to what we have deployed on-chain. 94% of the remaining gas that\u2019s \u2018left to optimize\u2019 is storage operations. This is very close to the edge in terms of gas optimizations. Regarding bank for your buck, we won\u2019t need to optimize it any further, especially with V3 around the corner. The patched version of SSB is running well in staging. We have considerably pushed the state size of that, and it\u2019s been stable. We are releasing that into production within the next couple of weeks. Right now, we\u2019ve been having to frequently migrate the protection system every few months due to the state size issue. The SSB is going to ultimately relieve us of that issue.  LongForWisdom: Will the Uniswap LP oracles be deployed following the audit updates from ABDK? Nik: Yes.     Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 19:10  After spending time on Liquidations 2.0 parameters, we\u2019re again becoming more focused on onboarding and evaluating new collaterals. The Smart Contracts team has solved the issue concerning PAX-G transfer fees. We have a task to evaluate our past risk assessment, which was done in October and have this asset onboarded within the upcoming weeks. We also updated the collateral onboarding sheet to see which collaterals are interesting or have high benefits to add next. It depends on the other teams and how much bandwidth they have to again begin onboarding more collaterals. We need to propose Liquidations 2.0 parameters for other assets. After completing LINK, we are proceeding with YFI and then delivering them for ETH, renBTC, and smaller assets. I may propose quicker implementations for liquidations 2.0 parameters implemented for Uni LPs because we recently proposed higher DC on Uni LPs. The aggregate DC for Uni LPs is now over 200 million. Liquidations 2.0 is really needed for Uni LPs as soon as possible. This brings me to the next topic, the latest proposal. It\u2019s now called Parameters Changes Proposal. This group used to manage rates proposed in a separate post to mandate proposing rate changes and changes related to DCs and DAI savings rates. This week we proposed changes to both rates and DCs. This, in my opinion, will make governance much more agile, especially when it comes to reacting to changes needed to DCs and for the proposal itself. We didn\u2019t propose any rate change for the two largest two. That\u2019s the first time in four months, despite debt still growing. We will feel a bit more relaxed once liquidations 2.0 is implemented. Risk-wise, it\u2019s looking much better, and because we finally saw some unwinding on the PSM and USDC stablecoin vault, we want to keep the momentum going. We also proposed changes to both rates and DCs for other smaller vaults. This is related to either better or worse collateralization metrics for vaults as well as liquidity metrics of underlying assets. This liquidity metric is becoming a continuously more important factor now, with liquidations 2.0 on the field. We finally proposed a few DC increases for Uni LPs, perhaps a bit more conservative than the model suggested. This is because, as a set, we may need a few more weeks to implement Liquidations 2.0 for Uni LPs. I\u2019m more optimistic on faster migration of LP liquidity from V2 to V3, making Maker Uni vaults unwind faster than expected. We will lose a lot of this demand in a short period if this happens faster than projected. There\u2019s not much to do until we have Uniswap V3 vaults supported at Maker. That\u2019s everything from my side. Next week we\u2019ll spend more time on various forum topics. Also, a post required input from our side regarding KAVA DAI implementation. There\u2019s also a post about increasing the Maker threshold for an emergency shutdown. We\u2019re still evaluating what the proper recommendation is, so stay tuned for that.   Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 24:14  We released the financial report for March. This week\u2019s big topic is onboarding NewSilver, but I will detail that more in a later segment. Most of the team worked on this topic for the majority of the week. We are still making progress with other asset originators. We have worked on an onboarding schedule for other assets. We need to speak with the rest of them to see if we have a realistic schedule before presenting it to the Community. This should be completed by next week.   Real World Assets - 001 Update  Matthew Rabinowitz 25:40  The long-awaited documentation for putting together the trust structure is imminently about to be released. We had a speed bump, which has caused so many delays. I\u2019ll be posting the effect equivalent of a table of contents and begin populating with the Core the material of all the legal structures involved and work our way forward from diligence to documentation. We will be finalizing the trust agreement whenever that is finalized. It is not yet finalized but is a work-in-progress. It\u2019s approaching a stage where the Community needs to get involved and have time to digest its diligence. I can explain the speed bump during the call\u2019s unrecorded section. The documents will be coming shortly.   Operational Support Update  Amy Jung 27:03 Operational Support Weekly Update: March 22- 24, 2021  I\u2019m excited to finally announce that Juan and I have been a little bit quiet on developing our Core Unit, Operational Support - because we have been working on a merger with @Wouter\u2019s Core Unit. This new Core Unit is called Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling. Juan will go into more details. Still, I will update what this means for Operational Support. First of all, it\u2019s a big level-up from where we left off. It will retain a lot of our core mandate, but it will give more structure and strategy. The biggest change is that SES will continue to incubate a selected limited number of Core Units because it functions as an incubator. Whereas we have been covering all of the Core Units, this Core Unit will not cover the DAO-wide Operational support in its traditional sense; Things like DAO resources, accounting, reporting, and so on. We outline a little more detail into many of the projects we have been working on as Operational Support. Many will be moving into the merger, but we will continue to support them in the next months. Juan will be onboarding as a Facilitator into SES. @Wouter will be the Core Unit team lead for that group. As for me, it\u2019s cool to come full circle. I\u2019m handing my Facilitator hat and going back to where I was two years ago, which is as a contributor. I will be joining SES as a contributor. Meanwhile, we will finish a lot of the projects at Operational Support.   Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling  Juan Guill\u00e9n 29:37  Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling1388\u00d7731 134 KB   We will do a specialized call for this. Therefore, I will be brief today. This Core Unit is aligned with our mandate. With Wouter and the whole team that we are onboarding, we will reach a whole new level. Dai has already established itself as a decentralized stable coin. Now we have the next big challenge: how do we grow and scale in a decentralized ecosystem, which is mainly uncharted territory as of now. Suppose we have a Core Unit that is mainly focused on research and on very hands-on applications. In that case, we can have this circle of continuous improvement. Having the Governance and the Forum be both the input and the output, we can visualize and identify the problems and their risks to prioritize them. We will complete the circle and then find talent and incubate them. We want the sponsorship part because we believe it is important to get things going quickly. Finally, to complete the circle, we want to be axed on the advisory part. We want to have continuous improvement, self-accountability and auditing, transparency, and best practices. For us, that is very important. We want to do it for ourselves and set a standard for the other Core Units to follow. We also want to be the trusted third party if we were to need to do something like a dark spell. We would be able to manage that process and safeguard it. That is good for a very quick introduction. We have posted the MIP\u2019s set in the Forum and on Github, and we are waiting for your feedback. Please read it and let us know what you think. We also have an open Discord channel. We will do a Core Unit Launching Pod Session to have a more in-depth conversation about this. I\u2019m excited to be part of this and to introduce the rest of the team.  Amy Jung: I\u2019m going to include regularly scheduled updates. If you scroll down to our post, I just want to point out that there\u2019s a Know-your-MIP #7 tomorrow for EuroDAI. There is a Core Unit Launch Pod Session coming up for Gov Comms. There are the recordings for the MKR Compensation Framework as well as the Community Call about grants. All recordings are up on Youtube as well. A few teams have gone into formal submission. Also, I would recommend checking out a post by @Jacek from the DAO and the Maker Foundation regarding KYC-AML, legal and regulatory areas that are happening. The BD-Growth Core Unit wants to increase the communication with Maker. That post is a great way to encourage this conversation around what they have been working on and what you would like to see. I would like to give a shout-out to the RWF team for continuously completing their monthly reports.    ",

I double-checked the budget proposals for the Core Units submitted. I just want to remind authors to add required budget implementations such as payment addresses and expected date of payments for the contributors if everything passes because this is all public.  Seb: I thought about this earlier, but there is an issue here because maybe you lost your keys or whatever you want to change your address. It\u2019s becoming quite difficult because we have to do the whole MIP process over again. LongForWisdom: For something like that, it\u2019s fine. We won\u2019t force people to go through the budget MIP again to change the address. It just needs to be posted publicly, saying we\u2019re changing from this address to that address, for this reason, then update the process over time.     Other Presentations and Updates  LongForWisdom  Recent Governance Issues 41:34  It\u2019s becoming more difficult now to get enough MKR to pass executive proposals. We\u2019ve not thus far had any weeks where we\u2019ve not passed it before that Friday. This next executive looks like we might hit that this week gave that it\u2019s Thursday, and we need 50K to pass. We\u2019re thinking of ways to mitigate this issue because there are security aspects with relationships. There are governance efficiency issues if we can\u2019t pass these things effectively. We\u2019ve discussed some possibilities to resolve this. One option is to involve the staking rewards proposal to encourage people to leave MKR in the governance contracts. Another option is a form of delegation.  Brian: Dss Gov is the next big project that we\u2019re planning to tackle on the smart contract\u2019s end. It\u2019s coming, but there is no definitive time frame as of yet. Trying to get little things like box and flash knocked out for some quick wins. Nonetheless, we might need a shorter-term solution to get things done. Kurt: Dss Gov envisioned a big monolithic update may be slow-moving to address these more urgent problems. I think Dss Gov is now a code word for the highest priority things, and how do we address them in a timeline that makes sense. Sam: This can be deployed for both Dss Gov and the current chief because it uses the IOU token. It doesn\u2019t require Dss Gov. due to recent high revenues; we can offer pretty high APY to people locking MKR into the chief. LongForWisdom: It\u2019s worth mentioning that these will have to come from the surplus buffer through DAI, which would have to burn for funding. Sam: Yeah, this would be redirecting the entire burner, but these are rates that are high enough to attract some of the MKR that\u2019s currently sitting in Aave, which is getting more and more dangerous; it\u2019s currently like at about 85% of that hat available for borrow. We can start chipping away at that with higher yields rather than offering 0%. If we were to redirect the entire burner, the APY would be 50% on a 10% lock up. LongForWisdom: Just to clarify, we would not use the entire burner to fund. There have been discussions concerning the APYs, but Governance will decide the movement of funds. Chris can talk more about options like delegation. Chris: I read some code way back when we were in Osaka; The idea is that you could use the voting proxy that we have, which has hot and cold wallets, to act as a delegate. Instead of locking into your own vote proxy, you will lock into a voting proxy that delegates the voting. Then it handles all of the primitives of dealing with the chief for voting the same way the current proxy does. Because it\u2019s a proxy, you can also take those IOU tokens and do something with them or make a proxy itself the thing that does something. This is the methodology that I was thinking of, but I don\u2019t know if you guys want to use Multi-sig or something like that as the delegate. There is a lot of design space here. Still, it is theoretically possible to bolt delegation on top of the existing voting system. Everything needs to be thought through.   Chris: Suppose you\u2019re doing MKR rewards. In that case, you don\u2019t want to get trapped in a situation where many people show up to farm the rewards and then drop that MKR on a hat that passes that single executive. No one cares about MKR sitting there farming rewards because then we can never pass executive. We need to focus on the problem that we\u2019re solving here. It\u2019s like governance participation; We need people to participate every week, deciding whether the executive should go through.  Sam: With Gov rewards, it\u2019s like targeting an individual who is currently holding MKR in Aave because they are getting a good yield. they want to vote all for all things being equal, but APYs are too high. Those are the users I want to target. Matthew: The danger is the 50K MKR sitting on the proposal back in December that hasn\u2019t been moved. That\u2019s currently where the hat is right now. If people just put MKR in the most recent hat and earn those rewards and just forget it, we may want the rewards only valid for the hats if the MKR is on the top 3 recent `hats. You don\u2019t want them to vote blindly. You also don\u2019t want it to sit out there and forget it. Sam: To be clear, this Gov reward is for locked up MKR in chief. They don\u2019t have to vote to get this. I don\u2019t think we should require them to vote because this will not force people to vote. It\u2019s like a get the MKR out of Aave incentive. Chris: If they show up and vote on that week\u2019s executive as they are getting in the chief but then walk away, we\u2019re locked out. Sam: Maybe we could ramp it up gradually? Chris: We can also have the delegation decay in the voting proxy so you can slowly decay someone\u2019s delegation. Sam: We need to careful. LongForWisdom: If we can\u2019t pass this week\u2019s executive, putting up another isn\u2019t going to help us. We have to pass it. If we don\u2019t, we will have to skip this week, which pushes back everything else. This is something we need to resolve. Chris: We have Liquidations 2.0 going through right now. We may not pass much of anything else.   Payton: There is fear around messing with the inherent incentive of the buyback and burn model. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a smart way to cap that or if it\u2019s us realizing that\u2019s going to be a risk we have to take. A large amount of criticism could be looped into that, taking tax advantage structure, making it nontax advantaged, potentially messing up the entire incentive structure for MKR holders.  Sam: It\u2019s a concern, but I don\u2019t want to mess around worrying about taxes when we have like existential threat here. We can come up with a better tax strategy later, but right now, we need to do something, maybe delegation rewards or Gov Rewards. Sebastian: The main issue we have right now is that we cannot pass any executive as of today. We need to find a way to encourage people to vote.   Chris: Going back to Sai, we had many executives that did not pass back in those days. Is this similar to the current situation where we cannot get people in?  LongForWisdom: There is no guarantee that this is a participation issue. For whatever reason, people did not like this executive. Your concern is unlikely because some of it has been signed off in terms of the Core Unit Budgets. The only possibly contentious ones are increasing the PSM DC by 1 billion Dai; it could be that people just really don\u2019t want that. We previously had a poll for that, which went well. It\u2019s hard to tell.   Phill: Is there a way to reimburse gas costs?  Chris: There will be in the Hard Fork. Kurt: There are ways you can do it right now; You have the record of transactions, and you know someone who mints Dai out the executives into a Merkle Claim Contractor has a third party sending Dai. Phil Chang: I\u2019m assuming that is the main deterrent.   Sam: I think it\u2019s an Aave issue due to relatively more efficient allocations of capital.  Kurt: Voter apathy is a big problem, but it\u2019s difficult to measure why more people aren\u2019t voting. nKunkel: The amount of MKR in Aave is not that much concerning relative to the outstanding supply of MKR. There is a ton of MKR out there that is (1) not voting and (2) not being used for farming yield through Aave. The focus is delegation. Some people have MKR but are not willing to delegate that MKR. If we can figure out why this is, we may not have to spend a lot of money from surplus. Matthew: We should think of the shortest critical path to help break through the log jam. We need something where a hat can only be the governing proposal if it\u2019s less than 120 days old. Sam: It\u2019s at 50k because Aave is at 43K, which is blocking people who borrow and then nuking the protocol. Seb: I think they can vote on December 1st and the new one at the same time, right? Sam: Maybe they can\u2019t vote. Brian: We have to address that investors don\u2019t want to work for their money but instead want money to work for them. A lot of investors buy tokens to be burnt and collect the gains from that long-term solution. They are automating as much as possible so that we don\u2019t have to rely much on that, but in the short term, I would love to delegate and avoid transactions every week. It\u2019s a lot of overhead to keep track of everything. Matthew: To address your point, you outlined about nuking the protocol. In parallel to any suggestion of changing the structure of the hat, it\u2019s a question of what will be posted in the forum once we get consensus. However, raising the emergency shutdown from 50K to something more material is in line.

Maybe we should schedule a different call. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s interesting for the community to call specifically for this, but I think it would be useful.  Seb: Yes, sure, that\u2019s something we can do. Payton: We don\u2019t have recourse on the loan script? If they go bad or bankrupt by force rather than voluntarily. We just have to eat the loss, right? Seb: What loan are you speaking of? The underlying one? The one NewSilver is making to the borrowers? Payton: It\u2019s actually our vault that I\u2019m speaking of. If NewSilver were to go completely under, then we don\u2019t have any real collateral, correct? Seb: That\u2019s not quite correct because we still have the drop tokens. If we are not repaying, that means that my investment is not replaced. It\u2019s just 100 Dai, which I had an issue with within KYC from a legal company. I didn\u2019t add the cash to invest more with my public account.   Kirill: Hi everyone, this is Kirill from NewSilver. I apologize for being late. I want to answer Payton\u2019s question. Let\u2019s say NewSilver goes bankrupt. The collateral is assigned to the SPD, which is bankruptcy remote. It will have an independent director. The vault is still collateralized by the loans, which will never go to zero because this is U.S.-based real estate. The chance of it going to zero would probably mean there\u2019s a nuclear war going on or something crazy like that. There is a chance that the borrower could default on the loan. In that case, have various mechanisms to collect. Toward the end of the collection, which is only about 5% or so of all of the loans that default, we could go to foreclosure, which means a delayed collection. But we still collect, and it does not go to zero.  Seb: Yes, and inside the SPV, the operating agreement says that as soon as the SPV gets some money from the loans, it is obliged to put it in the Uni pool, a smart contract. Even if there are no contractual obligations, the smart contract will do what the smart contract will do. Payton: That makes sense. It\u2019s the practical function in that we need to mark it down because all of these legal processes could take a while to get paid back. We write it as a total loss, and then whatever collateral we\u2019re able to scrape back gets added back into the buffer. Seb: Yes, exactly. Payton: Got it, thank you, that was very helpful.   Seb: I looked at the SPV that was used during subprime. The level of safety of this SPV is quite similar to the real estate mortgage-backed securities during the crisis. And during the crisis, the loss on subprime was less than 1%. On the non-subprime, it was a loss of 2%. Even if homes in the U.S. decreased by 25%, we might not lose anything.  Nik: The default assumption is 50% recovery in a worst-case scenario. Our collateral ratio will cover four of those, which is 200% losses. Seb: We would need the whole market to collapse, but we have a protection of 25% or something like that. The other case that can happen is that one or two borrowers will default, which will happen. It hasn\u2019t happened for NewSilver until now. I am on the risk side, so I will state that it will happen at some point. If that does happen, we will not care because it\u2019s way above the buffer we have in this pool. We can wait for four borrowers to default before having to care. LongForWisdom: Thank you very much, Seb. I think we\u2019re coming to the end of the meeting. As Juan said, maybe we should organize a separate meeting to cover this in more detail for those that are interested.   Lucas: We plan a community call focused on Centrifuge that we hope to discuss in more detail. I will post it on the forum. Seb is attending as well. That will a good place to ask questions. Juan: Tomorrow, we have the EuroDai with Tim Snoopy and Seb. For anyone interested, it is at 1:00PM UTC. It\u2019s the KYM section #6. Come join us. LongForWisdom: Thanks, everyone. Goodbye.

Right now the G&R call is a pretty unique space where general community members have access to facilitators and mandated actors that are constantly making key judgement calls on the protocol\u2019s behalf. I think it\u2019s incredibly important that we maintain that space, as the Forum is often a difficult place to navigate confusion on a process or implementation. IMO the best option would be to have non-critical updates be posted in the forum (and produced into other outward facing content by teams like the Content Production Core Unit) so segments on the call can focus on more contentious/difficult decisions that were made. I know before joining Maker it was the Community and G&R calls on YouTube that kept me updated and encouraged me to join the forum, so I guess I\u2019m trying to express an anxiety that we will change these calls to be more inward serving. To a certain extent that is good and important, but I would want to be mindful of how unique and important the space created by the G&R call is while we\u2019re doping it. ",

My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the Governance facilitator at MakerDAO. I\u2019m joined by at least 40 people interested in Maker and Maker-related things. If you want to interrupt, comment, or ask questions, please do. I would love to hear from everyone. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Governance Updates 01:00  We\u2019ve had an executive last week containing the initial implementation of the Real World Assets 001 with preliminary parameters for testing purposes. The Vault is not online yet, but this is a significant step in that direction. We\u2019ve also increased the ETH-A total available debt from 30 million to 80 million. This is known as the GAP, the amount of available space the DC instant access module tries to maintain within the ETH-A Vault type. We\u2019ve approved some collateral auction parameter updates. Please check out the executive page to see what those were. We\u2019ve also finished the weekly polls. They mainly were inclusion polls, but we also had a rates proposal poll which includes the minor increases to some of the Uniswap LP token stability fees and some other changes. We saw some inclusion polls for this month\u2019s Governance cycle, which had all passed. That includes the core unit MIP-set and the three initial core units: real-world finance, governance, and risk. We also saw the Liquidations 2.0 updates inclusion poll pass and some other technical changes such as the keg streaming payments module, the term lending module, and some software Governance stuff like multisig wallet management and parameter proposal groups. These will continue to the MIPs bundle poll next week. This week\u2019s executive will include ETH-C onboarding and the rates\u2019 updates I just mentioned. In terms of the Governance domain, Governance contributors have made a presentation on Wednesday on Gov-Alpha, the governance core unit. We are in the process of rewriting MIP 0 to make it more accessible. We don\u2019t plan to create actual content or logical changes but instead make it more accessible, clearer, and hopefully shorter. We are also working on Liquidation 2.0 documentation concerning governance parameters so that Governance can get an overview of what each parameter is, what it does, the trade-offs, etc. Finally, we had Elihu working on the MakerDAO mission setting, calling the project Compass, which perhaps Amy or Juan can speak about.  Weekly Updates Governance at a Glance Elihu 05:10 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread  Three-point-summary:  Total Value Locked (TVL) in MakerDAO as of today is $6.8 billion The DAI supply keeps reaching new highs with 2.6B DAI\u2019s volume weighted average price (VWAP) is stable at $1.001   ICYMI - Announcements  The 3rd session of the Core Unit Launch Podcast will take place on Wednesday, March 17. Join our host, Juan, along with the Smart Contracts Core Unit Team to discuss their proposal. The MakerDAO community will be featuring DAI on the Optimism Layer 2 solution, enabling near-instant withdrawals of DAI tokens and thus enabling wider adoption of Optimism and profiting from it on March 23rd. DAI has now been integrated into the GLUFCO Service Switch to allow the direct exchange of DAI to USD or VES in Venezuela. More regional currencies are expected to be added in the future.    Discussions  [Brainstorm/Discussion] Features I Wish Existed How to eventually remove DAI\u2019s dependence on USDC and other stablecoins  Signal Requests   Increase the bump / ttl parameters of FLAP auctions   @Aaron_Bartsch proposes increasing the bump and ttl parameters of FLAP auctions to decrease the number of auctions and give participants more time to accrue funds respectively.    Adjust the Surplus Buffer (March/April 2021)   @ultraschuppi proposes raising the Surplus Buffer with voting options going up to 80 MM.    Smart Contracts Team Update Christopher Mooney 07:20  We didn\u2019t have any collateral assessments nor collateral onboarding priority work this week. However, we are in the process of deploying ETH-C to Kovan. We\u2019ve got one more review, and then we\u2019ll end up pushing that to Kovan. Most of the tooling that we were updating has been finished, and it\u2019s now part of our ongoing process at this point. For MIP45, which is Liquidations 2.0, we\u2019ve completed some of the deploy scripts. We\u2019re prepping that for Kovan. We were hoping to have it on Monday. We\u2019ve got some of the audit feedback, and there was a couple of gas optimization that we\u2019re going to make. We also need to create a clipper-mon for the circuit breaker capabilities. We need to create a new ESM because we have to replace the old end contract. We need to make some updates around the ilk registry and the gas optimization PRs and whatnot. There is an additional economic attack situation that we\u2019ve been considering; We can either do nothing because the parameters we have are good enough or propose changes such as limiting the amount of dirt that we dig out of the hole. Kovan will be ready a week from now. Any team or integrator that\u2019s depending on that can expect to see those addresses sometime next week.  Wouter: Can you show the timeline again? Brian McMichael: While you pull that up, I want to mention that we are still waiting on Trail of Bits audit as well. Things can happen between now and then. We are not expecting any surprises, but just keep that in mind.     timeline1389\u00d7716 241 KB   We are on March 11th. Imagine we shift this Kovan deployment by a week. This entire set of other requirements is going to end up shifting by a week as well. This is going to be part of my next portion. We\u2019re going to do LINK first, and that will allow everyone to tool up around LINK, which involves all the keepers, and any UIs to make sure that LINK works. We are going to add YFI right after that. These are two mid-range collaterals. This allows keepers to make sure that they can handle multiple collaterals at once. Then we will go for big ones like ETH and wBTC. Following these are the standard collateral types, and then LP tokens will be last. Everyone can see this coordination that\u2019s happening across many other teams. We\u2019ve got databases, integrations, and UIs. We\u2019ve also had the final reports for PWC and Quantstamp. Every Friday, we have a session going on with Trail of Bits. Gauntlet has given us enough feedback for us to choose some good parameters with risk. Risk is still working with Gauntlet, but this might end up being more of an ongoing engagement to continue to stimulate those risk parameters and keep them up-to-date. As for MIP21, which we deployed to mainnet still has the one responsible for sitting down with 6S and doing a circuit. This is a dress rehearsal of the small DC that we gave them, making sure that all those contracts are connected up correctly. Regarding MIP22, we sat down with the Centrifuge team yesterday. We had a discussion about changing the implementation. More on that later as we actually converge on something. There\u2019s a portion of our team working on a security strategy. This is a formal verification that helps us ensure contract correctness and security of the protocol going forward. They are going to have a strategy that they\u2019ll be releasing soon. For miscellaneous work, we are reviewing authorizations of some of the mappings for authorizations to oracles and other contracts. Then, we\u2019ve been doing work with the SC domain team budget. There will be a community call with them next week. Derek, do you want to invite people to that?  Derek: Yes! We\u2019ll get the invite out. Juan created one for Wednesday, next week, everyone come along, and we\u2019ll share in all the usual channels.   Finally, we have been doing some side work on the L2 Optimism Dai Bridge. I want to thank Sam and other elements of the Community that have been putting that together.  Discussion Sam Macpherson 15:13  Earlier this week, I put out an announcement that we were going to be bringing Dai to Optimism L2. It received attention and excitement. It\u2019s a big opportunity for Maker to become the primary offramp for Optimism L2. There have been developments around the open-source, public code. We are building the first version of the bridge and using a multisig wallet due to time constraints. Optimism is coming online by the end of the month. We plan to roll out v1 of the bridge and then upgrade it over time. When the bridge is deployed, it is experimental, so be careful when using Optimism; This is currently experimental technology. Also, we are deploying a new version of Dai, which gives us a chance to modernize permit function, minor gas efficiency improvements, and add flash minting capabilities directly into the token. We may get flash minting on L2 before L1.  LongForWisdom: You\u2019re deploying an upgraded version of Dai to L2 on Optimism, not mainnet, right? SamM: Yes. It\u2019s essentially the same as L1.   Nkunkel: If Dai is the only token with flash withdrawals and the only stable token with these withdrawals on Optimism, it\u2019s a niche that we can conquer against USDC and Tether. They would suffer from capital inefficiency. From a technical POV, we can easily support every stable coin. The question is, do we want to?  LongForWisdom: Circle can offer the same flash withdrawal bridge. Samm: Because we can mint Dai, we will always have a liquidity availability advantage compared to others who may have to lock up capital. Matthew Rabinowitz: it depends on directions, where both directions cause an offset to the transfers. Initially, yes, but over time there should be harmony between their inflow and outflow of L2. Samm: This remains to be seen, but we have the upper edge advantage here. We should be at the forefront because we can mint Dai. Seb: Circle can do the same because as you go into the bridge, USDC is on the Circle balance sheet. They can mint USDC on L1 as well. They don\u2019t have the capital need neither. The USDC outstanding doesn\u2019t change.   BrianMcMichael: P.S., the community does not plan to make the Dai token upgradable on Optimism. SamM has posted a link about this. Consider this as an RFC period, so to speak.  Oracle Team Update Nik Kunkel 21:35  We\u2019re pushing the patched version of Scuttlebutt into production. This fixes the state-size bug hard-coded limit that Scuttlebutt has, determining how big it can get before it blows up. That was the issue affecting us during Thanksgiving. We finally resolved it. Therefore, we don\u2019t need to upgrade or reset the Scuttlebutt network every two months. We\u2019ve also been reviewing the feedback from the ABDK audit on the Uniswap LP oracle. They cited few things; nothing exploitable or functionality breaking. Still, we will look at a couple of fixes. We\u2019re hoping to have the revised version out by the end of next week reviewed by ABDK. After we get the go-ahead, we can consider raising the DC for the LP tokens. We must also keep the risk side in terms of liquidations on top of our heads. In the past, LP tokens did not go very well for vault owners. We want to ensure that the keepers are there to support and are willing to buy LP tokens.\u200b  Risk Team Update Primoz Kordez 24:28  There are not many updates. We\u2019re primarily focused on preparing grant proposals for Liquidation 2.0 parameters. As already mentioned by Chris, we\u2019ll start with LINK because we don\u2019t want to implement it for ETH vaults as of yet. LINK is a better candidate for a trial run because LINK has many vaults for liquidation, which can be tested. Also, the liquidation ratio is a bit higher. Therefore we can test the auction price curve. There are still some discussions concerning how to mitigate specific risks around limiting the number of pending auctions. The auction throughput in Liquidations 2.0 can be high. We may want to limit it by adjusting parameters. One potential adjustment is to lower the dependency on the auction price curve on OSM price. This was discussed on forums. This could be made to protect against historical attacks when the auction starts. In any case, we should have our analysis and proposal ready by next week. We should include findings and recommendations from Gauntlet, which had made excellent simulations. We have similar results, which is good because they use the GBM model to simulate liquidations. In contrast, we focus on simulating this auction using the Black Thursday price drop. Within the week, some signals are ending. Winning votes should go on-chain poll on Monday. I want to invoke increment of dust level from current 2000 DAI to 5000 DAI for all vault types except ETH-A. The dust value was proposed or voted to be 15000 DAI for ETH-A. Other changes based on signal requests are to increase the max DC for renBTC-A to 500 million to increase DC ETH-A to 15 billion. Basically no limit on ETH-A, which may sound odd, but we plan to limit ETH-A debt exposure by using rates as a tool.  Real World Finance S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 28:10  The week was mainly legal stuff. We made the first call with 6S and potentially have with future legal core unit on MakerDAO. We had a call with an SPV service firm that could help us scale the SPV business to make it more secure with more work structures. We\u2019ll have the ConsultFreight document review later this week. We are waiting for a final review, which should be done tomorrow. We are making an appointment with a law firm to review most of the documents that we will have to agree on to ensure there are no issues. I want to start by looking at how much it would cost to hire a lawyer and check those documents and everything\u2019s legal aspects. On the analytics side, we have a financial statement on Dune Analytics that works very well. Sadly, the pivot table presentation will be removed from Dune Analytics starting next month or next week. I don\u2019t remember. I will have to find another solution to continue to track the financials of MakerDAO. More on that in the following weeks. We did a review of MIP 21 and MIP 22 on the purely Smart Contracts. This is to understand how it will work with the rest of the Real World Assets\u2019 legal structuring with Smart Contracts and Centrifuge to work on MIP22. Lastly, we took the time to look at the RWA competition in DeFi. When we started last year, we were alone, but now there is a lot of competition. On the one hand, it could be harmful. On the other hand, it could be a good opportunity because we can use those protocols to delegate the management of RWAs at some point. It could be a solution to scale RWAs. Our idea on how to scale RWAs was, instead of using assets originators, to use assets managers that will manage a lot of assets originators. We can use something that is more DeFi-compliant using other protocols. There are a lot of different protocols that are dealing with RWAs. Space is early, not as early as Optimism but still super early. It will take a lot of time to see if something is interesting to be done in this case.  Operational Support Update Amy Jung 31:54  In terms of KYM and collateral onboarding, there have been no calls. We will soon begin to resume them. A lot of focus has been on the core units and their developments. Juan posted some of the critical functions that core units must cover to continue developing the protocol. It would be great to have some insights in there. We can follow some of the life developments on the coreunit.makerdao.network notion page. We have a call with Gov Alpha for this Launchpad series. Launchpad sessions are about the core units that want to present their team. It\u2019s like a job interview, so please feel free to ask questions that you want to. Regarding upcoming calls, Sablier is presenting tomorrow as one of the core unit tools. Sablier is discussing a platform where you stream money to whoever is working for you. On Wednesday, we have the Smart Contracts Team Core Units Discussion. I want to point out that the Launchpad series is about the core unit itself. There\u2019s a lot of conversation around vesting, for example. Derek\u2019s not necessarily defending vesting. It\u2019s specific to smart contracts. It would be great to bring questions for smart contracts regarding those areas as well. After the Governance and Risk call, I was thinking on Thursday, we would bring up the discussion more generally around incentives and vesting as a larger government. Long will add to the agenda. After the smart contract updates, we can compare and discuss the summaries and takeaways from that call. That same Friday, we will have real-world finance present their core units as well. Feel free to join that. After that, we\u2019ll have content production throughout the week. Four core units moved into RFC. Three of which are new. We have a growth core unit, Smart contracts, content production, and Maker DAO Shop by Coulter. There are few drafts in progress. Although there are updates on the coreunit.makerdao.network notion page, we have a lot being discussed which hasn\u2019t been publicly posted as a draft. Those are coming up. Kathleen posted strategic communications, PR, and marketing. She just updated the MIP and added budgets, which are still in the draft. It hasn\u2019t formally moved into the forum yet. An interesting conversation that is happening now is around MKR vesting and incentives at large. That discussion was a catalyst by the smart contracts budget. Long and I discussed bringing that thread out of the smart contracts due to the increased volume of discussion. Should the incentives be threaded at a higher level, or should it be in core units? What\u2019s a better framework and mechanisms? We will be discussing those deeper next week.  Derek: I just want to add that in the lead up to the Wednesday call next week, I\u2019ll broaden the conversation to the smart contract team regarding how we\u2019re looking to evolve, the discussion around potential sub-teams, and the different themes that we cover the team as of today and how it\u2019ll grow. If there are any questions from the community in the lead-up to that, feel free to drop them into the forum post that I wrote regarding the team. We can keep the discussion there. I\u2019ll have a presentation where we can walk through to get a better feel about the team\u2019s vision.    ",

                    "content": " MIPs Update  Charles St.Louis 38:07  For this weekly MIPs update, we had the formal submission period for the March governance cycle ending on Wednesday, March 3rd. There were a total of 21 proposals formally submitted of 32 that were eligible. This included MIPs expanding from Technical, General Process, Core Unit Proposals, and Amendments. On Thursday, all 21 proposals were confirmed by LongForWisdom to proceed to the inclusion poll stage on Monday, March 8th.   875\u00d7452 139 KB   The proposals were bundled into specific areas because 21 inclusion polls are a lot to vote on. We had them broken down into the Keg bundle, which covers the streaming payments using the Keg. Then there is the Core Unit Framework highlighting the entire framework for the Core Unit detailing the facilitator framework, the budget framework, the DAO primitives, and two amendments. If this framework is approved, the amendments will occur to the previous rules defined in MIP 16 and MIP 0. Initially, we had two technical proposals. One was the Term Lending Module, and of course, we had Liquidations 2.0 and General Proposals. We had Parameter Proposal Groups and the MakerDAO Multisig Wallet Management. Lastly, the 3 Core Unit MIPs for Real-World Onboarding, Risk Core Onboarding, and the Governance Team Onboarding.   868\u00d7443 158 KB   This week, we had those 21 proposals voted on in inclusion polls. All the proposals have successfully passed. Today, we\u2019re going to have LongForWisdom confirm that all the proposals are eligible for the monthly MIPs governance poll on Monday, March 15th.   878\u00d7448 107 KB   In terms of other updates, the March community green light polls will go out following Monday, March 15th. I\u2019ll show which greenlights polls that\u2019ll be after the newly submitted proposal review. We had three core units get proposed and are now in RFC. Additionally, we had a declaration of intent put forward for EURO-DAI. The previous one had been worked on and iterated on by Andrew Burban and co. Lastly, an official MIP zero amendment is being worked on as well by the Governance Domain Team. The proposals that are eligible for community green lights are ETH, 2 Curve LP tokens, 2 AAVE tokens, sUSD, SNX, sSUSHI, SolarX, and SD-BFDC. Ten in total will be put forward on Monday, don\u2019t forget to vote once those go out. That sums up my presentation for today.   1687\u00d7817 227 KB   LongForWisdom: Perfect, thank you, Charles. I want to confirm that the inclusion polls were successful. They will be in next week\u2019s MIPs bundle poll. Any other questions about MIPs?  Charles: It looks like Eli had something to add concerning how there are also MIP 9 amendments put forward to RFC recently. LongForWisdom: There\u2019s definitely a lot of stuff in RFC at this point. Does anyone want to start a discussion on anything specific? Amy: Do we want to talk about the governance process? LongForWisdom: That was in the sidebar. We could discuss that briefly. The questions concern whether we should do any governance action regarding the optimism DAI bridge. Maybe Sam could chime in on that?     Discussion  SamM 43:42  SamM: What I said in the post is that we could run a declaration of intent for the fast withdrawal piece, but due to the time constraints, we need to get this online quickly after Optimism goes up. Because it\u2019s a permissionless system and we were to not offer this as an official bridge, somebody can take over and become the official DAI on Optimism. I wouldn\u2019t oppose running a signal request of an urgent poll to decide whether or not we should go forward with this.  LongForWisdom: We\u2019re expecting Optimism towards the end of the month, right? SamM: Yes, that\u2019s what they said. LongForWisdom: We can put the poll up next week on Monday to confirm the direction. Anyone else thinks we should be doing more in terms of governance? Brian: It was brushed over very quickly, but there will be a multisig on Optimism controlling governance of that DAI token in the interim. There will be some authorizations to change parameters and things like that. There may be more to discuss concerning who will be in control of that multisig and how long. LongForWisdom: Yes, that\u2019s a good point. Have you thought about who would be key holders for that? SamM: That\u2019s something that we need to work out.   Nik: Would people be against having the mandated actors that are not a part of the foundation be the signatories on the multisig? Is anyone immediately against that?  LongForWisdom: As one of the key holders, I\u2019m not thrilled, but that\u2019s fine. We\u2019re the default option. That\u2019s something we could discuss offline and incorporate into the poll. SamM: Kurt, you\u2019re correct. We will definitely want to give governance control. It\u2019s not trivial to forward the executive intent up into L2. Even in the medium term, we want to ship that over to governance. LongForWisdom: Technically, does that need to be a multisig that\u2019s set up on Optimism? SamM: Yes, teams are working on it right now, building a multisig using Gnosis. This is a problem that almost every team in the ecosystem has right now, so it\u2019s being worked on.   LongForWisdom: Any other questions or comments on the Optimism DAI bridge?  Frank Cruz: Is this something that has to happen for every bridge? SamM: What do you mean? Which component has to happen for every bridge? Frank Cruz: The multisig. SamM: It doesn\u2019t have to happen. It has to happen if we want administrative controls on things. The bridge is a version 1 because we\u2019re rushing it out there. We are absolutely going to upgrade it as we wrap our heads around the ecosystem. To facilitate that bridge upgrade, we do need some administrative control. Otherwise, it\u2019s just set in stone. Kurt: I think the distinction here is not between having a multisig or no control. Instead, it is whether there is a multisig or control somehow given to the smart governance contracts. It\u2019s going to depend on a bridge-to-bridge basis and the extent to which bridge technology has developed. Since it\u2019s the first one, there are challenges to doing direct chief control immediately. In the long term, assuming we want governance to influence all the DAI bridges, we will need to start out with a multisig. We may also be able to start directly with the chief being in control. It depends on how the technology develops. Brian: Right now, if you want to transfer your DAI to xDAI, it goes through a bridge that\u2019s controlled by the xDAI foundation, and it becomes the native token on that network. If you want to transfer to Binance Smart Chain, Binance will wrap that token and give you a receipt. Those are DAI placeholders that are out of our control on those other networks. We would receive full control of the DAI on Optimism. We want that because the bridge will need to mint DAI as it gets passed through. Still, we will also want authorizations to give the mint authority to a new system. Right now on mainnet, the only thing that can mint DAI is the DAI join adaptor Governance can\u2019t even mint DAI if they want to. On liquidations 2.0, we will have the ability to have multiple ways to mint DAI. One of those ways being the bridge. Frank Cruz: Does that mean that Binance could technically mint a synthetic DAI? Brian: They already do. I think there were over 50 million DAI in Binance Smart Chain already wrapped into a wrapped Binance DAI. Frank Cruz: I meant a synthetic of a synthetic. If that makes sense. LongForWisdom: You\u2019re asking if they can mint DAI that isn\u2019t backed, right? Kurt: In that case, it\u2019s not DAI. Somebody can create a system that makes a synthetic that\u2019s pegged to DAI. Brian: That would only affect the DAI on Binance Smart Chain, though, so they can mint all they want. You\u2019d be responsible for auditing the amount of DAI in the wrapper contract that they have on Ethereum mainnet. Kurt: It really affects you if you\u2019re a user of that synthetic DAI. LongForWisdom: It\u2019s more of a problem if Binance passes it off as real DAI. I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re doing this now and don\u2019t plan to do so. Kurt: Hopefully, that won\u2019t be done.   Payton Rose: In terms of risk on the layer 1 side, what exactly are we dealing with here?  SamM: It\u2019s entirely opt-in, and anybody could deploy a bridge. There\u2019s no apparent risk to the Maker system. It\u2019s pretty safe. This will go up one way or another, so it\u2019s better if we get one that we could control and promote. Brian: There\u2019s always smart control risk. There\u2019s a risk that the DAI that goes in the L1 bridge component can get stuck there. Kurt: You can make a shortlist of the things that could go wrong when you\u2019re locking DAI in a contract like this. We need to do our due diligence and testing. SamM: The fast withdrawal component is a risk that we need to analyze for the system since it\u2019s a new collateral type. Kurt: It\u2019s worth noting that we can enable a bridge without enabling the fast withdrawal. Risks discovered to make that unattractive. It\u2019s essential to make that distinction. We could have the bridge with its particular risks with or without the risks of fast withdrawal. Brian: If the liquidations 2.0 portion of it having the ability to mint a token called DAI was somehow subverted, you could theoretically mint any number of it. The message passing has to be tight. Kurt: It wouldn\u2019t translate back to L1. That\u2019s not a risk to L1 or the main system. It\u2019s a risk to users of the L2 or things relying on that wrapped L2 token. There are risks on the L2 side for people transacting there as well. However, those don\u2019t translate back into L1 risks. LongForWisdom: I would say the risks are more reputational than technical.   Derek: I was looking at multichain the other day. If you have a look at the tokens there, you could imagine a scenario where Optimism launches. Sam\u2019s point around a permissionless nature of L2 means that you could end up with multiple versions of DAI or any other token on there. For a user experience, that could be quite challenging because if you choose the wrong one, you may not revert back to L1. It could be a loss of funds.  LongForWisdom: That\u2019s also just a nightmare for any integrations. Frank Cruz: This happens in the real world, right? The Bahamas dollar is a dollar, and US dollars get lost everywhere. If some of these people take the risk of minting DAI or taking DAI on Binance or any other layer 2 chains\u2019 part life. Brian: It is a risk to the mainnet system if our L1 DAI gets locked up in contracts. If it gets sent to Binance Smart Chain and decides we\u2019re not letting it out, that could be put pressure on the peg. Same if we have an L1 bridge that locks large amounts of DAI up, and our vault holders can\u2019t repay their debt. That would require us to try to solve that and get more liquidity on the market. Frank Cruz: You\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t think about the peg. Speaking of the peg, I am wondering if Primoz is still around. Can he give us a little info about the Gauntlet report on Liquidations 2.0? Chris mentioned that the risk team is working with Gauntlet.     Gauntlet Report on Liquidations 2.0  Primoz Kordez 1:01:13  Primoz: Next week, we should publish an analysis of the proposed parameters. I was thinking of including my findings as well as Gauntlets\u2019. Not sure if they want to come on a call and present their own findings. I can\u2019t speak on their behalf, but so far, it looks good. They simulated different combinations of parameters. There are nine parameters possible for each vault type. We\u2019re primarily concentrated on the price curve, how steep the price curve should be, as well as the pros or cons if we were to make it steeper or flatter, and when auctions clear. We want to know if they are moving too fast or too slow? We have similar results in some ranges of parameters, which is good. However, we\u2019re still optimizing the best combination of parameters. I can not make a whole presentation right now on their behalf.  Frank Cruz: Thank you, Primoz. LongForWisdom: You mentioned nine different parameters for each vault type, increasing complexity over the current system. I\u2019m interested in whether or not there is there any way of making that less complex for governance when they have to deal with it? Do you expect those nine parameters to be different for every vault type? Primoz: I\u2019ve been thinking about this one a lot. We\u2019ll make few vault types with a high collateralization ratio than others with a lower one. This is associated with the assets\u2019 volatility. The more volatile the asset is, the higher the liquidation ratio. This also affects the price curve and the buffer. LongForWisdom: In terms of price curves, is there any number of mathematical functions that you could use as a price curve? How stable should we expect that to be? Primoz: It\u2019s going to be an exponential price curve, not linear. You\u2019re starting above the OSM price with the buffer. In the early phases of the auction, you may want the price to fall faster, so that\u2019s why the exponential curve makes more sense. The difference is the slope. LongForWisdom: Thank you for that. Primoz: I\u2019m planning to write the complete analysis soon. Hopefully, it won\u2019t be too complicated.   Tanner Allar: Another thing worth mentioning that the complexity, in general, is going to increase over the long term. We\u2019re exploring decisions. You can call it computerized governance to better understand the system\u2019s state and the effects of policy changes and proposals.  LongForWisdom: Okay, that sounds intriguing.   Nik: The ABDK audit was thorough. Relative to what the foundation has usually paid for other audits, it\u2019s a very good value. I wanted to reach out to them to see if we could reach an agreement in terms of retaining them. Every month, they commit a certain amount of hours to do auditing work for us. It\u2019s a consistent form of income for them, and it\u2019s a guaranteed slot where we could get auditing work done. Getting auditors is a process that could take many, many months if you want good ones. People frequently will do this trade-off when they can\u2019t get the good ones quickly, and they\u2019ll go with a not-so-good one because they\u2019re available. I want to formalize this into a signal request. I would like to go ahead and have that conversation with them.  Brian: The audit came back, and it was very comprehensive. I was very happy with what they produced for us. Amy Jung: Are you guys thinking that it would fall under a core unit budget, or would we pay directly from the protocol? Nik: I was not thinking about it from a core unit perspective, but maybe that is the right way to do this. I want to lock these guys in before they get popular. Kurt: There are a few options there. It could come out of a combination of the smart contracts and oracle teams\u2019 budgets because they would both make use of them. LongForWisdom: I think expecting them to fill out the core unit sub proposals to start with is a big ask. Perhaps we want to set them up with a retainer agreement for the first few months, and then if they\u2019re going to formalize that further, we could bring them in. Nik: I\u2019ll approach them with that idea. If there\u2019s a warm response from their side, I\u2019ll put out a signal request on the forum. LongForWisdom: That sounds fine.

No planned Executive Proposal for tomorrow.  Polls:  No poll results this week. 2 Greenlight Polls active (voting ends Mon. Sept 20th):  RARE (SuperRare) RAI (Rai Reflex Index)     MIPs Weekly MIPs Update #52  1305\u00d7797 50.7 KB   The first Monday of the month is here, and the Formal Submission Window for September is now open. The following proposals are eligible to make it into this month\u2019s Governance Cycle.   Forum at a Glance Forum at a Glance: September 3rd - September 9th  Team-led Discussions  Growth  Institutional Vaults Growth CU Weekly Update  We have a new integrations leader, @zxMori. We posted a question for the community concerning us sponsoring the ETHOnline hackathon. Please leave feedback! After the Nexo Institutional Vault, we will be looking at ETH and BTC.  Currently working with legal and compliance teams to help find a solution to open Institutional Vaults with traditional companies. Main concern is changing the current proposal because Nexo will have to decide to agree on them.   Pros, cons, and clarifications:  Nexo Vault risk parameters can be improved; how do we renegotiate the loan terms after its 6-month period? We may have to potentially increase the SF based on market conditions, which is a concern. Potential to someday have high portfolio exposure to fixed-rate vaults, which can promote high SFs. Implementation of DssCharter is at 200%, and LR is at 120% for the Nexo Vault, which can cause complications to borrowers unwinding. Institutional Vaults is a way to increase the total size of our Vaults by having professionally committed users minting DAI. Nexo will be using the Fireblocks interface to manage their Vaults. Institutional Vaults can help promote increased DAI supply and allow smaller participants to use the MCD again, which is currently expensive.   Tokens using Maker Vaults:  Loopring wants to provide a service to their customers by offering Maker Vaults. This can potentially extend to other Institutional Vault companies as well. We should essentially set specific agreements with these quality projects that benefit both parties and helps mitigate risk.  Nik responds that we had an agreement with Polygon, who fell through those agreements and wasted DAI.   The Impossible Trinity Issue poses a potential long-term threat for fixed-rate Vaults. We need to think carefully going forward, especially with rates, which should move with the market to manage the capital flow. However, PaperImperium thinks otherwise because there is not enough pressure on the DAI peg.     Risk  Offboarding Vaults  Thinking of changing auction parameters for top-tier Vaults.  Propose a faster execution with a set of parameters to lower the duration and thereby increase auction throughput and amount.   Creating a risk-scoring methodology for Vaults on the Risk Dashboard.  Also, creating an additional risk score on Vault safety.   There have been some on and off decisions regarding offboarding low-tier collaterals.  Risk believes that these low-tier collaterals are risky because they have very high slippage. Difficult to offer more than a 10M DC, which may not even cover oracle costs. Data on Compound and Aave shows that low-tier collaterals promote very little use; a few million DAI generated. Maker is not well-positioned for such risky assets due to our inability to cross-collateralize.     Oracles  Offboarding Vaults  Continued discussion from Risk (above):  Onboarding low-tier DeFi tokens is sustainable on L1 only if the collateral generates a significant amount of DAI. There has not been enough experimentation, and the ones that were onboarded did not have much traction. Being favorable by other tokens and teams does not compensate for the risk they provide. We need to be more liberal when considering onboarding and offboarding tokens. We can offboard these low-tier collaterals for now. When they become profitable, we can then onboard them again.  These tokens are currently not helping to increase DAI supply; Time is better spent elsewhere.     MakerMan: We need to focus on the big fish and stop wasting time with the small fries.  Maker\u2019s competition is tough, and we need to match the competitive strategy at least if not do better. These mistakes can leave us in the dust. We need to set strict requirements for onboarding and offboarding.    ",

We focus on making information more accessible and digestible. We partnered with GovAlpha to do brainstorming to improve the G&R call. The problem during the last year has been this general town hall for status updates, sharing, and coordinating. With more CUs coming along, it is impossible to scale the format of the call in the format we have now. Therefore, we are making changes. We attempted to brainstorm various ideas that included CU rotation and team updates but concluded that it would eventually be futile with increasing CUs.   2822\u00d71566 228 KB   Our primary question is to define the G&R call. What is it? Once we define this call and understand the audience, we can optimize the way it is presented. We will be reducing the call length to 1h15 or less, and we will be doing smarter team updates. Written updates allow completeness for archivability, reference material, and complex reports. CUs and teams should post their weekly team updates on the Forums before the G&R meetings. Spoken updates are better for problems and blockers, seeking feedback and engagement. We want CUs to focus on the spoken update during this call. You can share in the forums what your team is doing and be reserving our spoken updates for the most pertinent topics. The definition of this call needs to be sharpened around the G&R of the Protocol. The idea is to share updates and discuss ideas that you think need to be discussed with the other parts of the organization, de-siloing and prioritizing information. The remaining 30 minutes of the call will be open for special presentations and open discussion. The goal is that if you are a stakeholder and want to know a specific thing, you should be able to find that through the written publications of the different teams in a precise search. Then, you would join these calls to talk about current events and issues.   Questions  Juan Guill\u00e9n: What is the objective or scope of the G&R call?  David Utrobin: We need to sharpen the definition of this call to have a concrete objective. We will be working on this in the coming weeks. Generally speaking, this call discusses and shares important updates. However, we will need to prioritize certain teams and topics on a week-to-week basis. Juan Guill\u00e9n: I understand. I believe this would be better and easier for everyone if we cleared up the definition and objective. David Utrobin: The move that we are making is trying to step away from this meeting, focusing on updates, which have been a chunk of the call for the past year. We want to incentivize more cross-team and in-depth discussion on current events and issues. Chris Mooney: We can quickly highlight our team\u2019s top update. We do not need to mention every line item, only the important ones. Juan Guill\u00e9n: We would like the audience to be explicit in who they are and what they want. David Utrobin: The purpose of this call is to discuss protocol management and move through issues or events. The purpose of this call is not to update MKR holders. Payton Rose: Our mission here with this rearrangement is to promote more discussion.

He will help partners with technical questions when they want to integrate the Maker protocol into their projects. We posted a question for the community concerning us sponsoring the ETHOnline hackathon. We can give prices. Please leave feedback in the weekly update.  Institutional Vaults:  After the Nexo Institutional Vault, we will be looking at ETH and BTC. Currently working with legal and compliance teams to help find a solution to open Institutional Vaults with traditional companies.  These traditional companies are interested in having liquidity from the Maker Protocol and offer safe, professional Vault management.   The main concern is the KYC problem and changing the current proposal because Nexo will have to agree on these changes. Traditional companies are interested in experimenting with DeFi and starting getting liquidity from the Protocol.   Discussion:  David Utrobin: What are the pros, cons, and clarifications?  Nadia: Nexo Vault risk parameters can be improved. We need to think about how we renegotiate the loan terms after its six-month period. Makerman brought a new idea in our Signal Request Poll to renew the next cycle of this institutional Vault. After six months, we have to renegotiate the terms of the loan. If the market changes drastically, we will not have a good position against the market and Nexo. If we give them a small SF, but we have to increase it because of the market conditions to the regular Vaults, that could be seen as unfair by the community in general. Primoz: If exposure to fixed-rate Vaults becomes too high, there will be a risk on regular Vaults. We may then have to potentially increase the SF based on market conditions, which is a concern. Total exposure to fixed-rate Vaults needs to be related to stablecoin backing. Potential to someday have high portfolio exposure to fixed-rate vaults, which can promote high SFs. Setting a threshold when fixed-rate vaults could have at most X percent of the stable coin banking is an idea. And it is not currently an issue because if Nexo migrates and mints. There is about 700 million exposure for fixed terms and 20% of the stable coin backing. As soon as you know this ratio starts increasing, we should be cautious. Another risk is implementing DssCharter, which forbids the borrower to mint additional Dai or withdraw collateral below a certain collateralization ratio threshold. In Nexo\u2019s case, it would be 200% where they cannot mint more, but liquidation happens at 120%. In addition, if the collateralization ratio drops below 200%, the borrower cannot make a certain unwinding procedure that some borrowers commonly use to withdraw collateral and convert it to Dai and then make repayment. This would not be possible unless the borrower uses a flash loan. The borrower needs to be aware because if they rely on this standard unwinding technique, this will not be possible due to DssCharter. We make sure to communicate this with all the borrowers to avoid unexpected issues. In summary: the implementation of DssCharter is at 200%, and LR is at 120% for the Nexo Vault, which can cause complications to borrowers unwinding. Nadia: Institutional Vaults is a way to increase the total size of our Vaults by having professionally committed users minting DAI. In the current situation of the Protocol, the Vaults on both sides are smaller than 200 million, and the biggest Vault we have now is Nexo for 400 million. The Institutional Vaults will commit to mint 200 extra million, which means that one user will have 600 million Dai minted. These numbers are based on L1 parameters. Wouter: What interface will Nexo be using? Derek Flossman: Nexo will be using the Fireblocks interface to manage their Vaults. We had a call with them today discussing the technical aspect of things, which seemed very positive. We walked through increasing Vault size, migration, and future practices of internal systems under certain conditions. Chris Mooney: We understand the philosophical approach of permissionless systems that allow anybody to participate. Creating permission systems is tying us to old-world models, which diverges from the blockchain philosophy. This is something to be aware of. Nadia brings up good trade-offs. However, we need Dai supply and desperately. Right now, small users cannot afford to participate and mint enough Dai. However, we need to find good ground between allowing protocol users to mint Dai and not seeming like a permission system protocol. Brian McMichael: DssCharter can get us there. But this two-tiered collateralization ratio where you cannot withdraw Dai beyond a certain point but LR is lower. This doesn\u2019t help borrowers but assures us that Vaults will be overcollateralized, reducing rates and attracting larger participants.   MakerMan: I support Institutional Vaults and RWA. I think we can do better terms. And I like the idea of having a buffer. However, my biggest issue is the impossible trinity, which we cannot yet get out of. We need to deal with rates. As soon as we lock down rates, the PSM will soak up the rate differences until they exceed. We need to think very carefully about how we work with fixed rates in the long term.  Chris Mooney: Interest rates cannot float up fast enough, which means we should not have a problem. Also, Nexo will not be against lowering rates. This should not put downward pressure on the peg. Brian McMichael: We have been above peg for over a year, and the PE team has been working on methods to put downward pressure on the peg. This does potentially create issues that MakerMan mentioned. However, this is something we have not dealt with for a long time and thereby have been focusing on the other side of the peg for the meantime. David Utrobin: The Maker protocol seems to have moved away from a rate-changing policy of changing the peg. Even though we have a more fixed-rate Dai supply, we are not using it. We are simply trying to get more Dai supply. PaperImperium: Primoz mentioned earlier that if we have too much debt from Institutional fixed-rate Vaults, we would have to raise the rates aggressively on non-fixed-rate Vaults. We should establish a relationship between the amount of debt we issue at a fixed-rate to the stablecoin reserve we have as accounting for that risk. David Utrobin: The more fixed-rate large Vaults, the permissionless Vaults end up subsidizing the rates. MakerMan: This leaves our options to raising rates on non-fixed rate Vaults, which will eventually close or raise the DSR and end up burning through the surplus buffer. Thankfully, we have a lot of stablecoin in the PSM right now. Someone: I want to bring up the idea that we will run into this same situation with RWAs. The trinity constrains them. We cannot raise rates on them. We would have to increase DSR and end up pinching our profits gradually. MakerMan: Yes, the Impossible Trinity Issue poses a potential long-term threat for fixed-rate Vaults. Going forward, we need to think carefully, especially with rates, which should move with the market to manage the capital flow.     Offboarding Vaults  Oracles and Risk Core Units  Risk - Primoz Kordez 49:18  Offboarding Collaterals in Terms of Cost & Risk We are working on changing Auction Parameters for Top-Tier Vaults. In the beginning, they were conservatively set to last around 40 minutes. Longer auction duration presents more market risks. There will likely be a proposal for auction parameters to be set to 40 minutes, improving auction throughput. Changes will follow next week with an update on the pros and cons and a signal request. Risk Scoring Methodology is in progress. For every price drop, we will have a good estimation of which users are safe and which are not and whether risk parameters need to be adjusted. Community voted to offboard eight Vault types. Growth CU proposed to discuss with the teams behind these tokens to see their potential to make more DAI, so we would not need to offboard them. The main reason to offboard them was because of oracle costs. Nadia suggested keeping some of the collaterals because of the potential for business development benefits. It is a matter of oracle cost vs. business development benefits. From a risk perspective, it\u2019s unlikely that lower-tier collaterals such as 0x, Loopring, BAT, MANA, and so on can have high-depth ceilings. The launch liquidity is low for these collaterals, which is risky because of slippage from Liq. For example, if you want to sell two million of 0x, you will incur 45% slippage on the chain, which is very risky. Maker is not well-positioned in terms of leveraged and compounded assets. If you hold BAT or 0x, you likely hold THETA or other altcoins. If you want to leverage, you would likely engage in cross-collateralization. AAVE is much better positioned for compounding.   Oracles - Nik Kunkel 56:23  High gas costs generally mean higher associated oracle costs. This is only sustainable for collateral types that bring in significant amounts of DAI or collateral types that have the potential to bring in significant amounts of DAI. There is a need to streamline internal processes from offboard discussion to execution. Offboarding vaults should not be controversial. If the liquidity profile does not support much traction, we should be able to offboard it. This is not an exception but the norm. We have successful vaults like YFI and LINK. For the most part, though, onboarding yield tokens did not have very successful results. Offboarding these tokens should not be controversial. If the point of not offboarding Vaults is to provide favors with these teams, we are essentially paying out of pocket for a potential but unrealized benefit. Assets should not remain onboarded simply because we\u2019re talking with the teams to monetize treasuries. These should be treated as two separate conversations. \u201cOnboard  liberally, offboard liberally.\u201d   Discussion  Nadia: We should have further discussion regarding monetizing treasuries. We are not staying with Loopring simply because of a potential benefit. Loopring is creating an L1 solution tool to help launch Maker Vaults on L2. It will not just be for Loopring token holders but other token holders as well. The vision we have on growth is that we should form partnerships instead of putting a proposal on the forum and accepting collateral. We should set agreements with other protocols. This is part of the process behind offboarding, which can offboard the tokens while maintaining partnerships with these communities. It is important to ensure that these partners will follow through on their end in these partnerships. For reference, Polygon promised several goals that they did not achieve by their designated time frame. There is a need to separate the relationship with partnerships versus the reality and the current Vaults. Vaults can be renegotiated. Right now, there are conversations and communication between different Vaults, but there is no clear framework that establishes what we want. It is not just about offboarding collaterals, but onboarding collaterals as well.  David Utrobin: Frequently, we have good business logical reasons for offboarding Vaults. While we want to maintain business partnerships, offboarding Vaults do not necessarily negate relationship management. We are spending $250000 a year on Oracle fees, and we need to ensure that these collaterals fulfill the fundamental goals of Maker. Kurt: We should be focusing on the next 10x Dai - are we going to get 10x, 1x, 2x? What\u2019s our floor for our interest rate? Nadia Alvarez: We need to focus on Institutional Vaults. If we focus on these tokens that can bring large Vaults to the Maker protocol, like Bitcoin and Ether, or monetizing treasuries, that will be a different Institutional Vault. David Utrobin: Can we make smaller people that want to be part of Maker subsidize themselves to be here? Can we have them pay for their oracle costs? MakerMan: We need to do a one-billion-dollar deal and focus on putting things in line. We need to compete with the rest of their protocols, with how they are playing it. We can bring that ten wBTC over to Compound, over to Maker, with bigger collateral types. I want to figure what happened with Polygon and Nexo. We need to focus on the bigger players. Let\u2019s figure out how to grow the next 10 billion, not the next 10 million. We are bringing RWA players because we have to. We can\u2019t grow this way, focusing on 10 million at a time. Kurt: Regarding my earlier comment about 10x: think about the revenue that would be brought in by a 10x of DAI supply. Maybe we should be working on that and eat the cost of the smaller things. We need to grow focus on that. We are spending more time on minutia without properly sizing the importance of discussing and debating. There should be a streamlined process for offboarding, and we should do that now rather than later. We have been talking about offboarding for months. I do not understand why we are wasting so many mental operations and time overhead for offboarding operations when it should be much simpler. MakerMan: Either do it or say that we are eating those costs. We should be talking about more productive things. Nadia Alvarez: We received a message from Binance that they want to release the pair MKR because there is not enough liquidity. They asked if we could release funds for liquidity to maintain the pair. Perhaps that is something we can discuss regarding offboarding the pair. MakerMan: Does this not just come back to a framework for onboarding/offboarding? If you maintain the minimum requirement, you\u2019re onboarded. If you no longer meet those requirements, you\u2019re offboarded.     Conclusion  Payton Rose 01:16:38  We will talk about the migration away from RocketChat in next week\u2019s call.  David Utrobin: If you have requests for discussion topics, feel free to reach out to Payton or David.

My name is LongForWisdom. I am the governance facilitator for MakerDAO. As usual, we\u2019ve got an agenda to get through. We\u2019ll have our regular updates by the usual suspects. Feel free to interrupt and ask questions. We\u2019d love to hear from you. If we run short on time, I\u2019ll move the meeting along, but please feel free to ask and get involved. Let\u2019s begin with the weekly governance updates. We saw a couple of executive votes finally pass at the beginning of the week. The week before last week\u2019s had passed, thereby onboarding a couple of new collateral types, which the UNI-V2 LP tokens for DAI-USDC and ETH-USDT. Last week, we had a bunch more stuff happening; UNI-V2-LINK-ETH was onboarded. We also had UNI-V2-UNI onboarded and DCIAM\u2019s activated for UNI-A, AAVE-A, COMP-A, LINK-A, YFI-A, and WBTC-A. We had a collection of stability fee changes, courtesy of the rates group. These changes were mostly upwards but with some exceptions. We approved the interim DAO budget, which has been funding the multisig made up of five mandated actors for 100,000 DAI. I believe 50% of that has been spent. The remaining 50% is held for covering unexpected expenses. That covers the executive changes. Polls this week finished over an hour ago. We saw the ETH-A max debt ceiling signal conclude with over 1 billion. This puts us at 2.5 billion, which is the ETH-A max debt ceiling. Therefore, it will be going into the DCIAM parameter. We also saw DCIAM\u2019s approved for LRC-A, BAL-A, MANA-A, KNC-A, WBTC-A. We saw the surplus buffer poll pass requesting from 10 million to 30 million DAI. And we saw onboarding polls for UNI-V2-WBTC-DAI and UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH both pass as well. Also, we voted to increase the DSR from 0% to 0.01%. All of these things that I just mentioned will be on the executive for Friday. However, I defer to the Smart Contacts team in their update. In terms of the governance domain itself, it\u2019s been working on the budget and mandates feedback. We posted the sub proposals for Gov Alpha, which is the core unit to cover governance. I recently submitted the following version of that based on the feedback. Thank you, everyone, for helping to shape those. It\u2019s much appreciated. Otherwise, we\u2019ve just been doing the usual stuff, keeping governance going\u2014all sorts of things. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Updates Peyton Rose Governance at a Glance 04:35 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated. Three-Point Summary  The 2B DAI mark sits firmly in the rear-view mirror, with DAI supply at 2.25B. With the latest SF increase, the protocol is generating 80M DAI in annualized fees. You might have heard this somewhere, but the VWAP for DAI this week was $1.001  ICYMI Announcements  Aaron_Bartsch put together a fantastic tutorial for adjusting DCs with the IAM   MIPs Portal V1 launched: A community developed site to explore all our MIPs is live, thanks @smaugho and team!  Discussions   EuroDAI  SebVentures discusses possible paths forward for a long-desired DAI pegged to the Euro.    [RWA] Things I don\u2019t like about Real-World Assets  e18r inspires a discussion about the push for RWA and the challenges of the asset class.    Should we explore launching on Binance Smart Chain?   smaugho explores options for cheaper transactions on the Binance Smart Chain.    Signal Requests   Increase ETH-A DC IAM gap  Aaron_Bartsch and ultraschuppi\u2019s powers combine to bring an ETH-A DC-IAM gap signal request. Voting ends tomorrow, Feb. 25th.   Adjustments to \u2018beg\u2019 and \u2018chop\u2019 parameters for UNI LP and ETH-B Vaults  primoz and @Jiecut signal adjusting the \u2018beg\u2019 (auction bid increment in %) and \u2018chop\u2019 (penalty fee) for UNI LP Vaults and ETH-B, respectively.    Move to Percentage IAM  Planet_X signals community preference on switching the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module increases over from a flat amount to a percentage.    Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 08:50  I\u2019m going to go through a list of the things that we\u2019ve done and call out anything that\u2019s interesting. Thank you, Long, for covering the spell executives. We haven\u2019t done any work on the collateral onboarding priority sheet this week. That\u2019s mainly because a lot of the priorities are complete. For collateral assessments, we got done UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH and UNI-V2-WBTC-DAI. Those two-LP tokens are going in this Friday\u2019s executive. We also have a UNI-V2-DAI-USDT collateral assessment complete. Last week, I mentioned that we were thinking about ETH-C and WBTC-B because we never had an original assessment, therefore we can\u2019t point at it. However, we decided we\u2019re not going to do that. They\u2019re already in the system. It\u2019s basically the same token. Collateral to Kovan; We\u2019re still getting MIP21 to Kovan. We\u2019re working through the iterative steps. There are more updates to the DssExec library and as well as our tooling. Some of which blew upon us this week. We had to put a lot of work in on that for Liquidations 2.0, which is MIP45. We still have some minor changes to the RFC, although those are happening outside of the RFC that everyone can see. That\u2019s for auditors to have a chance to look at the existing RFC. Then we\u2019re going to take their feedback and change that. In any case, we\u2019re coming close to a deadline on having that in for a finality. We want to lock it in before we make the formal submission. There are several minor enhancements for Liquidations 2.0, which are mostly gas savings. Audit work for Liquidations 2.0 is coming along well. PWC may have an interim report for us on Friday, as well as Gauntlet. However, I don\u2019t know about QuantStamp as of yet. MIP21, real-world assets; Sam found two critical bugs in the draw and wipe function. They aren\u2019t exploits. I want to highlight this because neither the authors wrote it, some of the original authors of the protocol itself, and every other engineer who works in the protocol had already looked at this. Some of us have been explicitly burned by this in the past, and we all still missed it. Sam found it yesterday. I know these things seem like they take a while, but there\u2019s a reason. It\u2019s because these little things can pop up. We also have more robust requirements in the liquidator module and several improvements to the test. We\u2019re going to get that spell in today or tomorrow. Centrifuge, which is MIP22, is on hold until MIP21 is finished, or at least until we get blocked on MIP21. Then for security, there are some updates to the DEFCON spell that Naz worked on. We\u2019re going to be shipping those, but they\u2019re blocked on stablecoin circuit breakers. We want to turn the circuit breakers off to reduce the governance attack surface on stablecoins. The circuit breakers are still on for the UNI-V2-DAI-USDC and the PSM. Therefore, in this executive, we will have two housekeeping items where we turn off the circuit breakers for both collateral types. That will then allow our DEFCON spells to be improved, and then we won\u2019t have to hard code all our stablecoins. We\u2019ll deploy those after that change is live. Miscellaneous items; We deployed the flips and joins for UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH, UNI-WBTC-DAI. You\u2019ll be able to find updates in the collateral updates channel. We\u2019ve updated the deploy scripts for some of the old LP tokens. We allowed Kovan to diverge from the mainnet. We\u2019re going to try and backfill Kovan with all of the LP tokens, which is not an easy job. We\u2019re not in control of those markets, or there may already be markets there; therefore, the pricing won\u2019t be accurate. However, there was a bug in the Oasis UI for DAI-USDC. Some people may have noticed that the UNI-LP token wasn\u2019t filling up. This probably would have been caught if we were able to stage it in Kovan and check it out. Nonetheless, the UI is just running on the mainnet right now. We\u2019re hoping to see if we can come up with a solution that will catch that. If anyone\u2019s planning on testing there, those tokens aren\u2019t going to be very useful due to inaccurate prices and whatnot. Also, the ordering of the tokens may flip. There are lots of problems trying to deploy those on there. There\u2019s a PR in review that Sam had made for dealing with fee-charging tokens such as PAX-G and USDT. We\u2019ll get around to reviewing that. If anyone else on the Smart Contracts team has something they wanted to say, please speak up.  Questions  Brian McMichael: A question came up regarding our staffing. There\u2019s been a lot of ideas in the community for things that we can do. However, there\u2019s not enough bandwidth to do them all safely. With the Foundation\u2019s transition and what comes next, there\u2019s been some hesitation on behalf of the Foundation to hire more staff for our team. We are interviewing now. These people will have to understand that there will be this transition, and nobody knows what comes next. We\u2019re working on that. Even if we hire up, it takes six months to get an engineer up to speed in a traditional engineering job. The Maker system is dense and intractable. We need to allocate more time before we expect any new devs will be running at full capacity. I don\u2019t know what the timeline is. However, the sooner that happens, the sooner we\u2019ll be in a good place and be able to hire and retain new engineers.  Frank Cruz: Brian, Schuppi mentioned that he spoke to a couple of his buddies who were devs. That wouldn\u2019t help, right? He tried to get talented people off the street to start working on something the community wants to push forward? Brian McMichael: We can use help with the collateral onboarding. We\u2019ve got this idea to run devs through a pipeline where we can have them on collateral onboarding and weekly spells where they\u2019re manipulating parameters. This will get them under our wing. Chris will then turn them into complete crypto punks in an iterative process from there. Frank: I got it. This is the reason why a lot of devs don\u2019t want to leave. Once you master solidity, you don\u2019t want to work at Solana with rust docs or that sort of stuff. Brian McMichael: Solidity is the easy part. It\u2019s the mentality that this is actually like hardware; This is space code. It\u2019s fun to add things to this, but it\u2019s also very dangerous to do it right the first time. We\u2019re all brainwashed to think that the MCD system is the best. But it is very fragile. We need to keep that in mind when we\u2019re building on it.    Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 19:18  Later today, we\u2019re going to be deploying the AAVE-ETH and WBTC-DAI LP Oracles for the collateral onboarding. We have fingers crossed that gas prices are low because each oracle deployment costs 500 dollars during the past few weeks. Also, Starkware oracles are going live tomorrow. It\u2019s the first time our oracles will be used on L2, which is a big step for us. This has been in the pipeline for a while.  I am very proud to partner with DYDX on that one. Teams come up with much more advanced testing and staging environment. That\u2019s going to allow us to start testing releases more thoroughly. More importantly, it allows us to begin testing many releases in parallel, which used to be an issue. If we do this collateral onboarding cycle every week, our staging environment is monopolized by collateral onboarding. We have all these other things that we want to test. However, we don\u2019t feel they can be tested in that one-week type of cycle. It\u2019s been difficult trying to squeeze in between the gaps. This is going to let us test unlimited things in parallel and releasing things more rapidly. Right now, we have four different builds in staging. One of the things that are in testing right now is called a patched Scuttlebutt client. What does that mean? Well, back during Thanksgiving, we had an oracle outage for a few hours. What happened there was that the Scuttlebutt protocol, which is a peer-to-peer protocol that is used to buy the oracle feeds to send price messages around, has a hard-coded limit on the state size. Think of it as if Ethereum had a max state size limit, and all of a sudden, if you hit that limit, it just falls over and dies. We had investigated the code, and it was a hard-coded line somewhere that states it can\u2019t get bigger than 4.6 gigabytes. Based on our investigations, there\u2019s no reason why that limit was there. We\u2019ve changed that value to a higher number, and then we spammed that staging network with a bunch of messages to see if we can get it over the previous limit. We checked if any of the behavior got wonky\u2014the initial tests for that look really promising. We\u2019ve easily broken over the previous limit. However, a lot of further testing is still done to ensure that it\u2019s actually stable. That\u2019s going to be really important. Right now, at the clip with which we are adding new collateral, the Scuttlebutt state size fills up about every six to eight weeks. That means that we have to wipe the state and go to a new Scuttlebutt network. We have to do a new migration every six to eight weeks, which is just annoying and a waste of everyone\u2019s time. Hopefully, we can migrate to this patched version for the subsequent migration, and then we won\u2019t have to do one of these migrations for at least a year. We could set the value even higher. We wouldn\u2019t have to do it for about five years. I think it\u2019s better to be safe before you overflow some random variable and a dependency somewhere. You don\u2019t want to go out that far. On the new oracle\u2019s front, we are looking at doing LP oracles for Curve and Balancer. We have a general idea of how to build those from a design point of view. It\u2019s definitely early in the R&D stage. We haven\u2019t really coded them up as of yet, but they look promising. We\u2019re also looking at Uniswap V3. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t give many details about that. I\u2019ve also been working on Oracle\u2019s core unit proposal. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s coming out soon, but definitely over the next couple of months. Lastly, we\u2019re investigating how to reduce the oracle gas expenditures, which I\u2019ll talk more about later.  Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 26:20  There aren\u2019t many updates from our side this week. We\u2019re dealing with developing a methodology of defining parameters for liquidations 2.0, which requires us to stress some historical price crashes for various combinations of auction price curves and other parameters in liquidations 2.0. There can be nine auction parameters supplied to each vault type. You can imagine how many combinations are possible. We\u2019re initially focusing on ETH-A. We\u2019ll propose a few price curves and combinations of other parameters and explain the pros and cons. There\u2019s also regular onboarding work on UNI LP collateral evaluations. Monet-supply is doing a great job publishing them each week. This week he\u2019s working on whether we should publish DAI-USDT-UNI-LP. next week, we\u2019ll potentially cover LRC-ETH-UNI-LP and YFI-ETH-UNI-LP. Marco is spending some time on renBTC liquidity and particularly potential risks to better understand renBTC liquidity in times of distress. This will be important if we increase the DC or onboard renBTC-B with a lower liquidation ratio. After that, we\u2019ll add parameters for the ETH-C vault high liquidation ratio vault. In the upcoming days, I\u2019ll make a post on the proposed parameters for ETH-C. There will likely be a poll. Finally, we made one poll this week on potentially increasing back parameters for UNI LP, minimum bid increment, and penalty fee. We aren\u2019t seeing enough keeper participation there, so please look at this signal and vote if you haven\u2019t already.  Real World Finance S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 29:04  We have produced some documentation that I hope is a bit clear because it\u2019s a complex subject. There is documentation that explains all the new terminologies that we are using. There is no longer a minimum underlying quality ratio. We have produced a dashboard, a fake one, to understand how we are tracking the SPVS and performance of the assets after we have made an investment. I want to thank the future legal team for helping us. Marin from the Kleros Fellowship helps us better understand some of the contracts\u2019 critical components. I also want to thank the business development team for all the work they have done because we have many new people who are coming to us thanks to them. We have a lot of work and many partners to onboard for the future. I want to highlight that we are still delaying the process. Some of our partners have difficulties keeping track of everything because we are dealing RWAs with real people. When we commit to them, they are trying to start to do things for this deadline. Sometimes it\u2019s a bit difficult to have a good understanding. It\u2019s mainly NewSilver or ConsolFreight because they are doing business and turn some people down when we cannot deliver. That\u2019s a bit sad. It\u2019s something we need to keep in mind for the future. Lastly, we made a risk assessment review that we will present shortly. Will Remor: In a nutshell, we had a little hole that we put in about a month ago, which was midway through some of our onboarding assessments. We wanted to get feedback from the community on the sessions\u2019 different sections. These assessments are a little lengthier than other assessments because we\u2019re analyzing the deals\u2019 structures and the different types of risks. But we\u2019re taking into account industry and things like that. We went out to the community and asked them for feedback on whether parts of the assessment would see more effort, greater focus, or greater conciseness. And we inquired about letting us know so that we could provide value for the people. But at the end of the day, they are voting on them. It\u2019s part of our interactive process with the community. We\u2019ve got a few responses on it, which was globally positive. We\u2019ve identified ourselves in the team and see a few points where we can make some improvements. One of the biggest takeaways is that the community wants a more focus on some levels of summary of what we provide for it. This includes an executive summary where they pointed out concerning the apparent risks of each individual deal that we get through the door? How can we provide just a TLDR version and include the core points into it? I think we are going to make a significant effort on that. Then we\u2019ll test the ground with the community. We\u2019ll be publishing that executive summary with a link to a more detailed version of the assessment so that people can know enough to make their decisions. However, if they want to drill down into the assessments\u2019 details, they can do that. This is probably the next point following on from here. Feel free to make any further comments in the chat, and we\u2019ll take that into account. Thank you, everyone. We\u2019re conscious that it\u2019s not always easy for the community, given that sometimes there are sensitive aspects, contracts, and things like these behind those deals. We have to go back to the asset originators and the people we work with to ask for consent on what we can publish and not publish.  Trent Van Epps EIP 1559 36:19  LongForWisdom: All right, I think we\u2019re going to take a short detour from the agenda to briefly go to a guest that we have. Some of you may have noticed that we have seen a request on the forum regarding whether MakerDAO supports the EIP 1559. This went up just before the call, and we have Trent here from Ethereum. Trent is going to tell us a little bit about that signal. Trent: Most of you recognize me from ETH global if you do at all. I\u2019m currently working on a small project with the core devs and Tim Baiko concerning the incoming lead on hardfork coordination and client implementations. I\u2019m working with him to get feedback from various Ethereum applications, including you wonderful people as the MakerDAO community. Just before this call started, I published the request for a signal. There\u2019s already been good discussion and feedback. I want to voice it on the call that you can find us anywhere on Twitter or Discord. I\u2019ll try to hang out in the Rocketchat a bit, but we can be reached if you have any questions or concerns. And, obviously, we\u2019ll be watching that thread. I think that\u2019s all I have. We\u2019re very interested in what the MakerDAO community has to say. We\u2019ll be collecting feedback and thoughts from the resulting discussion. There\u2019s a more extensive panel discussion on the 26th that we\u2019ll be presenting the results at. Thanks for the time.  Juan Operational Support Update 38:19  We have had quite a week. For Know Your MIP, last week, we performed term lending module MIP43 with Alan and Lev. The video is already on Youtube if you want to check it out. This Friday, Prose will be holding the DssGov\u2019s incentives. Join us this Friday. It\u2019s going to be interesting. Regarding collateral onboarding, we had had Fortunafi yesterday for RWAs with the team from Centrifuge. The recording is on Youtube. Next week we\u2019re going to have a call with Synthetix somewhat later than the usual time. Instead of having it at 18:00 UTC, we\u2019ll have it at 21:00 UTC. That\u2019s because Kain from Synthetix is in Sydney. Next is core unit updates. If you go to core units.maker.network, we have created a core unit corner. We can see all the sub-proposals drafted with links and clarifications from the various community members. We put in there anything related: any videos, links, small FAQ, and other resources. If you guys want to check anything or have any questions, that\u2019s an excellent place to start and keep things organized.  David Utrobin: I had a quick question. Were there any changes made during this RFC period to any of the core unit MIPs? I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s a summary anywhere for those changes. Juan: There is no summary. If you think that\u2019s useful, we could pull it, but that\u2019s probably already in GitHub now. David Utrobin: Even just a heuristic coverage of what was changed. Your experience during this RFC period would be interesting to me. Juan: Sure, I think the heuristic is longer to compile and analyze than what you make it sound, but we can try working something out if you think that\u2019s useful. David Utrobin: No worries. I was just looking for a quick and brief update. Don\u2019t go through more trouble than it\u2019s worth.

It\u2019s challenging to find things on GitHub. We\u2019re consulted for building this portal to show all the MIPs. I presented it on the forum, and here it is. This is a work in progress. It is the first iteration, and it\u2019s completely functional. We are listing all the main MIPs with their status and relevant links to the MIP on GitHub. So far, they can be filtered by. There is an available search that would permit you to search for any MIP you want to find. The search is quite general, but we are defining some elements at the moment. It could change the behavior in the future. The portal also has filtering, so you can filter by status. If somebody is looking for a specific status, it can filter for more than one. You can then navigate to the details of a given MIP, where we have a general index for navigation. We have the information pulled directly from GitHub, so of course, this is similar to what we\u2019ll see on GitHub. The data is also analyzed. You see here on the right that we are extracting information directly from the MIP. There is more work being done here. We expect to extract much more information shortly. With this portal, it\u2019ll be possible to add much more information. The software will detect this information and will make it accessible from here. There will be links to the MIPs on the forum where discussions are being held. All the poll requests are being shown here for expectations. There is work being done to link the request specifically to this MIP. There is also work being done right now regarding the soup proposals. As you can see, we are listing only the proposals. We are trying our best to follow all the guidelines within the design and creation of components. We are working on proposals for displaying the soup proposals, which are coming soon. However, they are not available right now. Also, each MIP has a sentence, including a paragraph summary. I added the repository. If anyone wants to contribute to the development, that would be great. In the repository, we detailed the general architecture of the system. At the moment, we are indexing all this information on the backend. We have a webhook so that whenever any change happens on this repository, it will call the backend, updating the index. That will reflect directly here.  Juan: Can we see the feedback button? It should be on the bottom right of the website. It appears to be hidden currently. Adri\u00e1n Rivero: Please feel free to make recommendation requests. We are happy to hear from the community to help improve the portal. LongForWisdom: Great, Thank you Adri\u00e1n, we\u2019re looking forward to having further development on that in the coming months.    Nik Kunkel Oracle Sensitivity Changes 55:46  It\u2019s no surprise that gas prices have been really high. You\u2019ve seen people complaining that the gas prices are high, but it doesn\u2019t just affect users. It affects us as a protocol as well. One key example is oracles. To update an oracle, we are spending an obscene amount of money on gas. It\u2019s within the $20,000 per day range. I\u2019ll let you do your own mental math about what this comes out to in a year; It\u2019s a lot. And this is after we\u2019ve done our tech optimizations to cut down gas usage relative to the previous version of oracles. Something has got to give here. We\u2019ve looked at a variety of things, such as zero-knowledge proofs. We\u2019ve looked across the board, but the fact of the matter is that there is no good solution. There are only solutions that come with trade-offs. One of those trade-offs is that you update the oracle less frequently. I\u2019ve been talking with Primoz about this concerning the risk perspective because there is more collateral risk from a reviewer\u2019s liquidation point if you update less often. Collateral may not get liquidated as quickly, and that\u2019s more risk for the protocol. Juan has done a fantastic job. He compiled data showing the frequency of oracle updates at various oracle sensitivities. What is sensitivity? Right now, for significant assets like ETH and wBTC, we update them on a half of a percent type of sensitivity. That means that every time the price you see in the market differs from the price that the oracle is reporting by half a percent, the oracle is updated. For non-major assets, we update about every one percent. What Juan has done here map out if we were to select a different sensitivity regarding oracle updates\u2019 frequency. It\u2019s mapped out by asset. The important thing here is that you don\u2019t compare the various assets because these collateral types were onboarded at different times. There may be a discrepancy between them. Therefore, you can\u2019t really do relevancy between Comp token or YFI token. But what you can do for each asset is identify how the number of updates you need to make changes depending on how much you manipulate the sensitivity. ETH, for example, did about 2700 updates. If we were to raise that to about three percent sensitivity, we would get that down to 608 updates. That will be the order of magnitude change we could expect in terms of the number of transactions we\u2019d have to do. This is directly proportional to the decrease in cost that we\u2019d have. Right now, we\u2019re spending about $20,000 a day. If we did something like this, we could get this cost down to $5,000 a day, which would be a huge improvement.  Open Discussion 1:02:15  Matthew Rabinowitz: Are you doing updates based on percentage change or with frequency?  Nik: We do both. The trigger for the medianizer is either a time-based update or a sensitivity update. I believe the time is a little over four hours, but we rarely hit that. It\u2019s almost always the sensitivity that gets hit. First, that\u2019s on the medianizer front for the oracle security module that gets updated at the top of every hour. That is a fixed variable. No matter what, you\u2019re doing 24 transactions a day on the oracle security module. Then you have to add the number of transactions that you\u2019re doing on the medianizer, and that\u2019s for each asset. Matthew Rabinowitz: The reason I ask is that it falls into the trend we spoke about last week concerning risk. If the price is going up, it\u2019s not a risk question. It\u2019s only a risk when pricing is going down. Nik: Yes, that\u2019s a very astute observation. I\u2019ve discussed with the main digit actors as well as Primoz. Essentially, it\u2019s for assets that have larger liquidation ratios above 150%. We would feel comfortable raising the sensitivity of those by either 3% or 4%. Looking at the ones we have here, that would be KNC, ZRX, MANA, LRC, BAL, BAT, and AAVE. Then the ones that are starred, which are YFI, UNI, and LINK, should be on here. We are still unsure about these. we have more DAI minted against the assets. Hence, the system has more exposure to them. There is essentially more risk, but I still think the cost savings are likely worth it. I\u2019ll leave the decision on those three up to Primoz and the rest of the risk team.    1774\u00d71004 295 KB  Primoz: The way this would affect vaults is that they would potentially be liquidated a bit later. As Nik said, we\u2019re talking about a small percentage figure compared to the liquidation ratio that we\u2019re using for these vaults. I don\u2019t see a huge difference in changing risk profile by implementing this from a market perspective. Some could even argue that this could be positive for vault users that want to unwind. They would actually have more time to unwind. There may be some other implications such as integration risks and so on. Still, I\u2019ll let others working on integrations explain any downsides. In regards to market risk, it\u2019s not a huge problem, in my opinion.  Will?: Nik and Primoz, can I make a suggestion on this one? Don\u2019t base it only on the liquidation ratio perspective. Some of those assets also have liquidation ratios due to their volatility. Wait to increase the sensitivity with some volatility denominator standard deviation or whatever just to make sure that you\u2019re still appropriately weighing the level of downside risk appropriately. Primoz: That\u2019s a good point. I think the percentages that we\u2019re talking about are a bit small. It\u2019s not a massive change in market risk profile. Then you have the auction, which is something random on its own. I personally don\u2019t see a huge problem. Christopher Mooney: The point I wanted to make is that a lot of the focus has been on the cost and additional risk that it makes for Maker. However, this was brought up and is being suggested in the mandated actor\u2019s group. We have customers of our oracles, and this affects them. Nik, were you planning on doing this across the board for everything or limiting this to price feeds where we\u2019re the sole consumer?   Nik: Yes, right now, it\u2019s going to be limited to ones where we\u2019re the sole consumer. Fortunately, that\u2019s the majority of them. The way that the distribution of our oracle demand is spread out is between ETH and wBTC. Those are the ones that we\u2019re not changing. They\u2019re on a higher sensitivity of a half percent. Those are the most expensive ones to run. I think it\u2019s totally worth it, especially since the Maker protocol\u2019s amount in exposure to those is huge. You definitely want to make sure your oracle for those is as accurate as possible. We also see people frequently request the oracle security module. They\u2019re not using it because it\u2019s a gauge of a fair market price. Instead, they\u2019re using it because they want to perform vault management. The only thing they care about is that Maker will liquidate on the following price update in an hour or not. It doesn\u2019t really matter if we change the sensitivity of the medianizer from an OSM point of view. The customer just cares about liquidation coming, yes or no, in the future. That is something that we\u2019re going to have to look at. We could say that if you want to use an oracle, our default is 3-4% sensitivity. If you want a more sensitive one, then you can pay for the gas. I just want to bring up that this problem is not only exclusive to us. Chainlink has the same problem but much, much worse. This is an ecosystem-wide problem. The long and short result is that DeFi needs oracles, and DeFi cannot be run without oracles. There are two paths from here. Either people pay up because they realize running these oracles is too expensive. It\u2019s a service that they need to invest a significant amount of money into. The other way is that people stop caring about the decentralization of oracles. If a decentralized oracle costs $100,000 a year, why would I pay that when I can run my own little bot sending a price update. This would be cheaper in gas, but it\u2019s not decentralized. Our industry is full of people who are very ideologically driven and believe in decentralized finance because of the decentralized aspect. When we get an influx of new users, will those values be passed down to these new users? Is DeFi simply the latest casino? The idea of valuing decentralization is really lost where decentralization is a meme or a word without any real meaning rather than a principle by which to design and use systems. That sounds a bit somber, but that\u2019s kind-of where we\u2019re at. If you look at Binance smart chain, it\u2019s an EVM in which many validators are all run by Binance. It\u2019s not decentralized at all, but the growth has been insane. What do you make of that? On the one hand, you can say that Binance is a massive exchange with many users. It\u2019s effortless for them to funnel their users onto the Binance smart chain. You could also say that there\u2019s a lot of people who use the Binance smart chain who don\u2019t care about decentralization. Thus, to each their own. From a business point of view, that\u2019s something we need to take a look at. Are our oracles simply a necessary expense right now for the Maker protocol, or is this a business we want to get into? We know there is a need in the industry. Can we serve that need? Somebody: Does ETH 2.0 change anything at all?  Nik: Yes and no. ETH 2.0 will bring a proof of stake where you get a 3x improvement in scale and sharding. Presumably, people would be running on various shards. That being said, it\u2019s not this pretty picture that everyone makes it out to be because you need to be on the same shard if you want to have composability. That means that if Maker is on a shard, where does everyone else want to be? Does Uniswap want to be on the same shard as Maker? Probably, or maybe it\u2019s the other way around. So you have this effect where everyone wants to live in Manhattan, but the cost to do a transaction on the DeFi shard will still be expensive. It\u2019ll be like prime real estate. That being said, other things that generate a lot of activity right now don\u2019t have to be on that shard. We will see some reduction, but it is unclear what degree and what the costs will look like. Nonetheless, I am sure that the prominent DeFi protocols in a world where ETH 2.0 is launched are that they will just be printing money. Even if the oracles are expensive, they can afford it. This I am 100% sure of.   LongForWisdom: There were other questions in the sidebar that we could get to. Who wants to go?  Nik: Someone asked about the UNI LP oracle audit. It\u2019s currently underway. We have the initial feedback, but it\u2019s still ongoing. The way this usually works is they give you an initial report. Then, we review the report, fix any issues, or argue that something they cited isn\u2019t really an issue. After that, they go back and make a final report, which is what\u2019s published. We\u2019re still a good week out from getting the initial report. Nik: Tim also asks if we have any idea how much our customers are willing to pay for the oracles? Right now, it\u2019s all free. To be honest, I think we have to keep it free. It\u2019s the only way to gain market share. It doesn\u2019t cost us that much more. We have to make these oracles either way for the Maker protocol. Expanding the usage to customers doesn\u2019t cost us anything more. To give them a price wouldn\u2019t make sense. You can look at the big picture of how critical oracles will be in the future. Chainlink market cap is a ridiculous number. For their business\u2019s size at the moment and its profitability, yes, that\u2019s a ridiculous number. Still, if DeFi scales the way I believe it will, then oracles will be a huge business. We want a piece of that pie. This is not the time to be cost neutral on oracles. We\u2019re fortunate to be in the position where Maker protocol is making a ton of money. We should be investing that money. I think this is an excellent bet. Frank Cruz: With regards to flash loans. If you lower it to 3% or 4%, let\u2019s say on AAVE, would that entice people even if they realize the sensitivity is down? Nik: Not quite sure what you mean. The collateralization ratio is significantly higher than this 3 or 4% sensitivity change. In the worst case, if the oracle is off by 4%. The collateralization ratio is 175. There\u2019s no way to do a flash loan and run away with money because you still have to be significantly over collateralized.   LongForWisdom: We\u2019re approaching the end of the meeting. Any last questions or comments before we wrap up?  Nik: I see Aaron had another question concerning our oracle customers\u2019 payment structure and how it is going to look like? That\u2019s up for debate. My personal opinion is that now is not the time to worry about charging people. Instead, we should focus on getting as much market share as possible. This pie is going to keep growing, and you want to secure your position in the pie. Tim: Yes, but then we shouldn\u2019t worry too much about the money we have to spend on the oracle, right? Nik: Yes. Now, if there are no customers that are using it, then let\u2019s cut costs. Let\u2019s say that a customer wants a sensitive UNI oracle. We can take a look at whether we want to take a loss on that one or make a deal that subsidizes the actual cost. Those kinds of things are still up for debate. If anyone in the community feels strongly about that, I will work on a proposal with them. Juan: Going to the other side of the spectrum, you could have the oracle update every 0.1% move, and you will have a transaction on every block, which will be very expensive. However, that\u2019s not a reason to not do it. It\u2019ll make things more optimal. David Utrobin: Is it true that if there are enough customers for a given oracle, everybody\u2019s overall cost goes down, and we could charge less for oracles? Nik: Yes, that\u2019s true. To do that, we need market share. We need a critical mass of users, which we do not yet have. This is my goal. I want my core unit to take the business component of oracles much more seriously. We need to scale this up. We have a real opportunity here. Our oracles are just as good as Chainlinks\u2019, and from a gas point of view, they\u2019re ten times better. We need to leverage that and market it. Matthew Rabinowitz: Are you talking about expanding the scopes of MakerDAO to include pricing crypto assets as well as others using those oracles? Nik: Yes, and I think that we are uniquely positioned. I believe in a future where many RWAs want to use Maker as a credit facility. If you\u2019re going to be onboarded to Maker, you\u2019ll need Maker oracles to price your stuff. It\u2019s essentially a moat business. Suppose the protocol says we don\u2019t take Chainlink oracles because we only accept Maker oracles. In that case, this will drive business to us. People want to use us as a credit mechanism. There\u2019s a lot of ways where we can get customers which Chainlink can\u2019t poach from us. It\u2019s intrinsic to using Maker in the first place. There are many ways to carve out a significant chunk of the market, which gives us a massive advantage to our oracle business. I\u2019ll have my core unit proposal out in the next few months, and it\u2019ll be extensive.   LongForWisdom: Thank you, Nik. That was a very valuable discussion on the value that oracles could bring. We\u2019ll wrap up here. Thank you, everyone, for coming.

Welcome to episode #165 of the Scientific Governance & Risk Core Unit at MakerDAO. My name is Payton, and I am one of the governance facilitators. I am happy to see everyone joining us live and later on Youtube. We got many awesome Maker people here, both those who work in the protocol and those interested in the operations more in general. This is our weekly meeting. We will discuss some key issues facing the DAO, governance updates, and other fun tidbits information. In terms of housekeeping, this is an open meeting. We will try to get to all people\u2019s questions. The mic line is open if people have something they are curious about or would like some clarification. Feel free to hop on and ask. If not, feel free to throw it up in chat. Today, we have got a couple of good discussion topics. We might have some time in the end for a more open discussion. If you have questions that are not relevant to what is being discussed, save them for the end, or maybe throw them up in chat to follow up with them. That would be greatly appreciated. We added an anonymous question box to let people ask questions and give feedback without necessarily revealing who is doing the asking. It is a great tool. Please, do not talk over one another. We will bring in a lot of different voices to this call. Please be mindful of how much space you are taking up.

Meetings &amp; Discussions with others2241\u00d71251 302 KB   Meetings were not only limited to us. We had lots of meetings and discussions with others.   Key Takeaways2237\u00d71251 289 KB   L2 War Room Meeting. Ecosystem Awareness. Team Alignment for Q4.  21:24  SamM: We had a few meetings with various teams. We met with the Aave team in preparation for the D3M launch tomorrow. We met Danielle from MIM; she is the king of the degens. It was fun to meet and see what the degen side of things are.  22:04  Nadia Alvarez: We met Klima and talked about credit carbon tokens and how we can start working together and understand them better. It is a new world for us. We need to learn how to integrate these tokens and their practical effect on the Maker protocol. When I read Rune\u2019s post talking about climate change and how to create clean money, I do not know who else is doing these kinds of things. Klima people are very into that. There are many people on DeFi thinking about what they call ReFi, like regenerate finance. If we ever start doing the Clean Money initiative, we are not alone. Other teams are also thinking about that.  23:31  SamM: A lot is going on. I have a reading list of deep dives I need to do and other protocols to figure out what is good. I will probably be launching into some of those. After the meetings, there are lots of exciting projects. We will see what is suitable for Maker. Maybe there are some partnerships there.  23:55  Nadia Alvarez: Thanks to Nick and Sam for our conversation with Wintermute. We explained to them why the community, in general, was not very comfortable with the terms of their proposals. So they have improved their proposal and updated it in the forum. Having Wintermute will be very helpful for us. We need a lot of Dai liquidity not just on the main net but on all these other L2s and the different chains. If we want to be on n Arbitrum and all these other chains, we have to have someone helping us provide liquidity. It is important to have them not just with Dai but also with MKR. If you check out markets of MKR, the MKR/Dai pair does not exist, and it does not seem well. Now that we will start with the Clean Money initiative, the idea is to start conversations with new investors interested in Maker because of this new mission. It is also essential to show them that they will find enough MKR liquidity in different markets. Their proposal that I invite everyone to check out includes decentralized markets and centralized exchanges. We have difficulty deploying liquidity because those exchanges usually have Dai or the Maker paired with Fiat currencies, such as dollars and euros. Unless we have an entity, create a bank account, and provide the other part of the market, we cannot do that. You also have to provide the other side of the market in addition to the Maker or Dai. This partnership is intriguing. It is good that they want to buy MKR and good to have a new MKR holder around. Wintermute working for and with us will be a good signal for the market.  27:00  SamM: These sorts of trips are invaluable. I was meeting everybody for the first time and after so long. There are many unique benefits of meeting in person.  27:25  David Utrobin: I have two thoughts and questions about market-making Dai and how the protocol approaches expanding into other markets. Two markets might be DEXes, that we might not need a partner because everything is on-chain. Technically we do not need a Fiat, a third party, to do the market making. On the centralized exchange side, you need a third-party service provider to do the market making. Can we create a standardized deal for a reputable market Maker who wants to do a deal?  28:23  Nadia Alvarez: We have to work on that. It will be the first time that in case that we approve something like this, that we, as Maker, will be giving an MKR loan without collateral and with that call option. We have to create a MIP for that. This will open the opportunity for other market Makers to present a proposal using that MIP. We see on the Growth team that when we start conversations with projects on other networks, like Solana or on Layer2s, and they do not see enough liquidity of MKR or Dai, they decide to integrate another stable coin. We have an excellent relationship with the Axie Infinity team. They were thinking in the past to have Dai as their main stable coin on running their new blockchain. But due to Dai\u2019s liquidity, they preferred to go first with USDT. We need to improve Dai\u2019s liquidity in all other networks. We can do that by working with the community. We need help. If not, it will be hard to convince all these other new projects and networks to integrate Dai. ElPro was surprised at the conference; he always tells me that everyone knows about Maker and Dai. They love us, but liquidity is the first thing everyone looks at when integrating us.  30:47  David Utrobin: For standardizing the deal, we should be separating Dai market-making from MKR market-making. Also, if we are giving MKR to centralized market makers in an unsecured fashion, is it a secured loan? Are Maker holders protected in this deal, even if it is acceptable terms with regards to recourse?  31:34  Nadia Alvarez: We have to create this new proposal, go to the forum, and have a community\u2019s feedback. First, we could use the MKR that is on our treasury. We do not have to print new MKR for this. Second, we are talking about Wintermute. I am supporting them because of what Wintermute is for DeFi and because they work with the most prominent crypto companies in the world. I do not know if I would support a market Maker that maybe is a new one, is working with one or two protocols, or is working with DEXes.  32:59  David Utrobin: There is reputational legitimacy with who is offering the deal. In an environment where Maker does not have a legal team and entity, they could turn around and screw us. I do not see a method for us to be protected. It is a handshake.  33:21  Someone: We do not have that anywhere. We have to rely on reputational damage.  33:32  Someone: Why not use the Real World Assets Foundation or some legal structure? We discuss how to do this with RWA and give a market Maker a handshake that seems counterintuitive. I know Wintermute. I am a Counterparty of theirs. I have traded with them. They are good. I do not want to discount them. This is a very different scenario than we are discussing anything else we have done in loan space.  34:17  Payton Rose: This is a good topic. We should follow up on it. Was there anything you wanted to add before kicking it over, maybe to David?  34:34  Nadia Alvarez: You can check the weekly updates from Growth that I posted on the forum. I posted some of the pictures that Burban took from last week. It was great to meet you all in person. There were almost 64 people in the Telegram group. It was a small conference compared to EthCC in Paris. However, seeing all these Maker people around it was awesome.  35:16  Payton Rose: I am glad you got to connect with the outside parties. The only one I saw mentioning wanting to add to their time in Lisbon was David. I will kick it over to you now. If other people are looking to speak, drop a line on the chart. We will get you next.  35:36  David Utrobin: I wanted to recap the highest level view of my team\u2019s experience there. I did not go with my entire team. I went solo as a facilitator. I knew that around 60 different CU facilitators and members were going to be there. I treated it as an off-site. In my conversations over the seven days I was there, about 70%-80% were with Maker, DAO internal stakeholders. I heard that it is hard to understand the story of what each of the individual CUs is doing. It is hard when there are 17 or 18 CUs and doing something special or specific within each CU. I heard that complaint a lot. That is why we are working in GovComms to create an aggregated team update publications. Look out for that. Also, the other 20%-30% of people I spoke to were more external MakerDAO stakeholders, former investors, Dai users, Vault users, people who write great academic papers, guys like Dimitri Brinson, etc. They did not know anything that was happening at Maker. They did not know that the foundation dissolved, that we have 16 different ratified teams with another four or five in the pipeline, or about the diversification of the PSMs. All of them know Dai as a USDC wrapper in their head. The public sentiment is somewhat what people have in their minds when they think of Maker. Events like this are extremely important for teams, not just telling their own story at Maker, but telling the story of Maker. What we have done over the last six months is impressive and wonderful. The foundation wound down ahead of time. We have 16 teams. We have come far, and we are continuing to grow. I am very thankful to have met so many of you, understood how the teams are structured, and learned who the point people are. We do not get a lot of these things in our online interactions because we are focused on whatever the agenda for the call is or whatever you are specifically DMing someone for. When you have off-sites like these, where we are all interacting with each other, we get a higher resolution of information. I highly encourage other CUs to prioritize showing up at some of these off-sites. The ones where many people are relevant to your CUs work are powerful. It is compelling to go in person, meet, co-work, and do working sessions around common projects.  39:28  Katie: When is the next big event coming up that everyone is going to go to? I would love to participate and see everyone.  39:35  David Utrobin: I would say ETH Denver happening in February has a lot of interest. Tickets are free.  40:08  David Utrobin: I have one other thought concerning Wintermute about the idea that they did not know what was wrong with their proposal until Nick and Sam talked to them. They were reading the comments. They understood what people were talking about but did not understand what they should change. Interestingly, at the DAO, we do not have a formal process where a point person follows up on specific deals. Informally, that has been Nadia and the Growth team in various capacities. Also, others, like engineers, have specific conversations with other individual engineers and such. We need to focus on having a point person follow up on deals, summarize the sentiment on the forum, make that process more reliable, and ensure it happens.  41:45  Primoz Kordez: I wanted to add that there were six of us, the Risk CU in Lisbon. To meet many people for the first time after two years was worth it. It was very productive at the same time. Regarding external meetings, we had a talk with Aave on D3M, which was helpful. The biggest impression I got was in Denmark two years ago; everybody talked about flash loans. Now everybody is talking about protocol, liquidity, or at least people I talk to. It is the concept that Olympus DAO introduced. This is becoming a thing. Many established DeFi teams were talking about it. It made me look more deeply into it. The concept is fascinating and could be very applicable to Maker. Maker liquidity is significant and especially when you potentially face delusion events. I talked to some bigger teams who are doing the liquidity mining 1.0, and they are desperate. They are spending a lot of money on liquidity mining. They are looking into discussing the concept of protocol and liquidity because it helps them with users who are currently dumping rewards after they harvest them. Plus, if they own liquidity, you start to create interest. Even Rune\u2019s proposal mentioned this. We are looking into it because it is an exciting thing.  43:35  David Utrobin: Primoz, can you give a high-level explanation of what does it mean protocol-owned liquidity?  43:44  Primoz Kordez: You incentivize users with their tokens to lock liquidity. The LP, which in our case would be Maker Dai liquidity. They lock it into the protocol, and they get some benefits. Like Olympus DAO, which fundamentally, it is probably not the soundest thing, but you could do other stuff as well. You can start rewarding users for liquidity on their own, and their words are not dumped as they usually are through pool two, which was usually the case in classic liquidity mining schemes. It gets more complicated than that, but I do not want to spend too much time.  44:44  Juan: It was great seeing everyone. I do not know how many people I met. We had the opportunity to put Maker into the dialogue. Also, I wanted to thank Nadia, Corine, and David. I think they were the main organizers of the Maker event on a super lovely terrace where we could meet everyone and mingle. I am not sure which CUs contributed financially, but the three were doing the heavy lifting. Thank you very much. It was very nice. In the name of all Maker, thanks.  45:34  Payton Rose: Do we have any more comments or questions about Lisbon and what we discussed?  45:48  David Utrobin: How do we organize as a DAO as part of independent CUs around events, sponsorships, etc.? I have been noticing teams can directly go and sponsor, teams can jointly sponsor, teams can jointly propose SPFs to sponsor. There are different ways to do it. Not every team goes to every event. Will there be, in 2022, a full Maker DAO off-site with all of the teams?  46:53  Juan: It is decentralized, David. We could potentially coordinate something. You cannot force people to go. It will be a nice thing. We probably need some time and someone to take the initiative. If someone says in October, we are all going to X Y, Zed. I can see people organizing around that. And then network effects.  47:16  David Utrobin: In this coming year, there will be a handful of popular events. And I want at least one where it is a Maker con. We talked about Maker con at least at the foundation for a couple of years. We are getting to a point where the size of the DAO and its external stakeholders is getting big enough. We should consider which one event we all go to versus the side events that some go to. Although we are decentralized, it would be great to be organized.  48:00  Juan: As a British philosopher named LongForWisdom would say, you are hired. We will be waiting for your lead.  48:24  David Utrobin: Is it part of anybody\u2019s scope the events side of the DAO? SES has a budget for events. Our team also has some budget for events. I am sure others do too. To whom does the onus fall?   Adding WBTC-B  48:42  Prose11: This is a good time to transition to our separate second discussion topic. Burban brought this up with many others; the B protocol, this idea of a WBTC-B vault. We also had a post from the risk core unit on how we could be utilizing the WBTC-B versus a B protocol, WBTC-B vault. So we wanted to give some time today to discuss the risk concerns about this. We are presented with another situation where we have declared that we want to do a B protocol back vault. Yet, we also have our needs for acting quickly and not missing out on the opportunity for WBTC-B. Primoz probably has some thoughts on this; please kick it off for us.  50:09  Primoz: So everybody is aware there is a bull run. So there was a lot of minting on wBTC. We reached the debt ceiling, but it is getting increased in one or two hours. Burban made the post already to onboard lowered liquidation ratio for Bitcoin Vaults. We can see in this bull hype a demand for more leverage. If you are on board the regular wBTC-B Vault, Oracle does not require much work on B.protocol. It is on us to prepare and currently work on a risk assessment. This poll should be live soon. Sean from our team posted how to proceed because there was already a vote on B protocols implementation, a similarly low liquidation ratio vault. However, we believe some time will be needed to onboard it because it requires a new Clipper contract. B.protocol needs to get involved, and this could take some time. In the meantime, this massive growth could end. The other question with B.protocol is its scalability quickly because it is an experimental implementation with a low debt ceiling. Another limiting factor is the number of committed liquidators. They need massive capital of committed liquidators so that we can scale the debt ceiling of such Vault. That is why we just proposed to release a wBTC-B, the regular Vault, as soon as possible. In the meantime, we will work on the B.protocols proposal, which means we have two similar vaults. Similarly, a low liquidation ratio should be around 130%. Why can we not offer any lower liquidation rates, like 120? The issue is that we are using OSM, and there is a one-hour delay. There is also the risk of uncollateralized Dai. If Dai drops too severely, there will be a market risk in auctions if a delay is one hour or greater. The B.protocol itself would not increase our ability to offer more risky vaults or more leveraged vaults, but it does have its upside. Having committed liquidators is good because the more capital we know can bid to prove it is on-chain, the bigger auction throughput we can enable. The current auction throughput is limited due to reliance on auction cycles. If you need to liquidate, for example, a few 100 million, every 30 minutes, there will be approximately 40 million liquidated. It would take some time. You have committed liquidators. Again, if they have this amount of capital committed, you can increase the throughput. So, this is possibly the biggest upside. The only probable downside is that we will lose some penalty fees. This is something that some people do not like. We should just proceed with regular B.protocol BTC, do this experimental Vault simultaneously, and then see how it goes from there.  54:11  Kirk: I would like to give a little bit more color on the B protocol. I may be the most familiar person with this on the team. The new Clipper is not that complicated from a technical perspective, and B.protocols has already been written. We could have that reviewed within a couple of weeks, assuming no problems are found. And then on the subject of committed liquidators. We could do something if the market were not putting a lot of liquidity, and it was just very similar to D3M. MakerDAO could mint Dai and take the B protocol LP shares onto its balance sheet so that Maker itself provides liquidity into the B protocol. That could allow us to grow it, perhaps independent of market interest to be an LP and B protocol.  55:12  David Utro: Does that make the protocol the end liquidator? Do we become our keeper?  55:21  Kirk: Yes. We are providing immediate liquidity there and purchasing out of the auction. Then the way B protocols new BAMM works is effectively a stable swap pool. However, it is scaled, a fixed discount is offered on the collateral, and it sits there. It is the open arm for the market to take. MakeMakers that initial purchase with Dai for the collateral. Then, over time, the market will see that and rebalances back to Dai.  56:10  Prose11: In terms of WBTC-B, before liquidations 2.0, it was too risky to have a lower CR for rapid coin. But we are much more confident in our auction system now. I was curious if we had any sort of indication. As Primoz mentioned, we have a one-hour delay in dealing with what will probably be the most limiting factor. Do we have any auctions data? Is there an ideal number we can get to with the current setup? Is 130 the lowest we can go?    56:59  Primoz: On our dashboards, you can see how the auctions are performing. On the risk model tab, you can also see what the risk premium is. We could probably go below 130 for wBTC. From the volatility metrics, the severity of the most severe crashes is smaller for a wBTC. Of course, you could argue that Bitcoin is centralized, so it carries its own risk that needs to be accounted for as well. We usually treat it similarly. Even though it is less volatile, it has its own risk. It is also less liquid which is counterparty risk. I could see liquidation rates going to 125, for instance. Then, the issue becomes this OSM and delay risk. People could meet on uncollateralized Dai. This now becomes a problem from the instant access module because we have started limiting the depth growth to mitigate this risk. It will get constantly hit, and this is one downside as well.  58:20  Prose11: We did talk a little bit about maybe offering a lower Oracle delay or different things we can do with Oracle to provide larger margin loans. I was curious if you want to speak to that.  58:47  Niklas Kunkel: I see a big slide of WBTCB here that sets the stage. We need to offer higher leverage options in terms of ETH and WBTC. That means much lower collateralization ratios. In the past, the limiting factor was the Oracle Security Module delay; If you cannot liquidate for at least an hour, you are taking on price risk during that hour. This limits the right amount of risk that we can take. We have to account for an extra hour of movement. There have been 20% blips in an hour before, for example, Black Thursday. If we are going to offer these higher leverage options, we need to either reduce the delay or get rid of the delay. I was talking with the mandated actors about this. Now I wanted to present this idea to the community. What if we offered degen vaults? Not degen in terms of the shitcoins that you can use to generate DAI, but rather in terms of the amount of kind of protections you have. Why is the delay there? The delay is there to protect against an Oracle attack. If a quorum amount of feeds were to launch an Oracle attack saying ETH is $10, then every ETH Vault would get liquidated. So instead, you can use the Medianizer price instead of the Oracle Security Module price, so there is no delay on the price. This enables the protocol to liquidate instantly if the market moves. From a protocol safety point of view, this is fine. But from a user point of view, you lose the Oracle attack prevention ability to cover your position. Normally, you have an hour where you know you will get liquidated or payback or add more collateral. From a protocol perspective, it is safe to do this. It is just that the user loses a lot of the guarantees. If we make it very clear to the user that these are very high-risk vaults and they are choosing to do this of their volition, we can do this. But it also goes against the super safe narrative that we have built. There may be some value in that brand that the community sees as more valuable than the possible revenue we would get by offering much higher leverage.  1:02:50  Primoz: It would be interesting to offer such vaults depending on how you communicate with the users. They need to know it is not an OSM Vault this time. In terms of auctions, would the Dutch auction system be appropriate for this kind of Oracle setup? Should we instead use a similar setup to other lending platforms, with a fixed discount when liquidated? Maybe we could even do it with current Dutch auction parameters.  1:03:37  Niklas Kunkel: That is a valid concern. You have the OSM delay. Then you have the latency of the auction completing, during all of which we are taking a lot of price risk. If we want to offer super high leverage, we should look at a discount to the Oracle price, for example, 3% to spot. This would be a lower latency mechanism.  1:04:29  Prose11: I see Mio bringing up in the chat this idea of the upside. That is a pretty good question. Do we have any sort of idea of what demand for a lower liquidation ratio wBTC Vault might look like?  1:04:47  Niklas Kunkel: If you look at something like ETH-B, there is not even high leverage, but the leverage is higher than what ETH used to offer. There seems to be a lot of demand for ETH-B. Presumably, if you offer even more leverage, there should be some demand for that as well. I want to be clear here, we are not just talking about wBTC-B, but we are also talking about ETH. There is a demand for leveraged ETH or high leverage ETH.  1:05:26  Primoz: There is also one other consideration. If you use ETH-B at 130 liquidation ratio and also use the Defi Saver, you could essentially always be on the limit. You have one hour to react. In contrast, you would not have enough time to act if you offered a medianizer based on a 20% liquidation ratio. You would always need to ensure enough buffer, which could be higher than 130. So, in the end, is 120 much different with medianizer than, for instance, 130 with OSM? From user experience, they might just use the same level because everybody is protecting it one way or another.  1:06:23  Niklas Kunkel: I believe ChrisB bought this up in the chat just now. It is not one hour or nothing on the delay. We may have a shorter delay, say 10-15 minutes. In that time, Defi Saver automation would be able to save you from liquidation. While you do get that protection back, you do not get any Oracle attack protection. The one-hour delay time is one hour is because that is the Chinese fire drill time to rally the troops, get in the War Room, and get a spell pass to shut the Oracle down before the price takes effect. In a 10-15 minutes timeframe, you are not going to be able to do that. So, you do not get the Oracle protection back. However, if people are concerned about managing the risks through Vault saving infrastructures, such as Defi Saver or their flavors, we can get those protections with small delays. In regards to the pricing risk, an extra 10 minutes should not matter that much. The auctions would last longer than 10 minutes. In that scenario, the auction is the limiting factor for the amount of leverage that we can offer, not the delay of 10 minutes or whatever it is.  1:08:22  Primoz: I agree here; good point.   Conclusion  Payton Rose 1:09:00  I did not see any other topics for discussion pop up in the sidebar. I appreciate everyone coming in and participating today.

My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the Governance Facilitator at MakerDAO. Apart from the usual weekly updates and segments, we will have a presentation by @sorenpeter from the DAI Foundation. If you want to ask questions or have comments, please do speak up. Everyone here enjoys answering questions.   Weekly Updates  Governance  LongForWisdom 01:00 MakerDAO May Governance Review  We passed last week\u2019s executive vote which did a couple of good things. First, it moved the Uniswap LP token vault to the Liquidation 2.0 system. Second, with the executive, we whitelisted B.protocol on the WBTCUSD Oracles. Third, we increased the Flat Kick Incentive tip from 0 DAI to 300 DAI. Finally, we increased the PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling from 2 billion DAI to 3 billion DAI, which I know is met with various excitement, but at least we can keep the DAI peg.   Polls and Executive  We had a poll to reduce the PSM-USDC-A Fee Out (aka tout), and that was successful. So it will be included in this week\u2019s executive votes. That\u2019s tomorrow. The polls to onboard the Sushiswap LP Tokens also succeeded (SLP-DAI-ETH, SLP-WBTC-ETH, SLP-USDC-ETH). I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see them this week, but they will be in an executive coming soon. In tomorrow\u2019s executive, we will see the Core Unit Budget Distributions for June. We will also see an increase in the Global Debt Ceiling to resolve some of the issues that we have been facing for the last few days emitting DAI. We will do some final Liquidations 2.0 migrations. The Protocol Engineering will elaborate on that in a moment.   GovAlpha Core Unit update 02:55  There\u2019s a forum post; you can go there for details. The Foundation Frontend Team created a UX for Delegation, which we have seen and signed off on. Big thanks to @tiago for producing those. We have set up the GovAlpha multi-sig fully. The spending limits and allowances are set up for the Pause Proxy. We have also done test transactions that were needed for us to get the necessary confidence. Onboarding plans are going well. In a couple of days, there will be a forum post on that. It covers some of the positions we are hoping to fill for GovAlpha and what things they involve.   Forum at a Glance  Elihu 04:36 Forum at a Glance for May 28th - June 3rd  Three-Point Summary  There\u2019s currently 4,7B DAI in circulation. System Surplus Buffer is at 39,6MM DAI. Total Value Locked in Maker is $9,1B.   Announcements  There are two new posts on the Foundation blog. One is on Smart Contract Wallets and another on Community Development.   Active Discussions   Governance-Focused Documentation   @LongForWisdom starts a discussion around existing and/or needed governance-related documentation.    Need for Data Insights Core Unit   @tmierzwa points out the need for a Data Insights Core Unit to aggregate and present on-chain data for the improvement of the Maker ecosystem.    A Multichain Strategy and Roadmap for Maker   @Derek presents a bird\u2019s eye view of the Layer 2 ecosystem and the various opportunities for Maker.     Signal Requests   Burn the 84k Foundation MKR   @Aaron_Bartsch is running a poll to burn the 84,000 MKR recently transferred from the Maker Foundation.    Should we add new PSMs?  Another Signal Request by Aaron is looking to add Price Stability Modules for new stablecoins.    Lower the UNIV2DAIUSDC-A Liquidation Ratio   @hexonaut is seeking consensus on adjusting parameters of one of the Uniswap LP vaults.    Adjusting Dust Parameter   @monet-supply is suggesting adjusting the dust parameter to account for various recent developments.    Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001  Last but not least, the Parameter Proposal Group has put forward a set of parameter changes for various Vaults.     Protocol Engineering Team Update  Derek 06:55  Hi everyone, I\u2019m Derek from the Protocol Engineering Core Unit. First, I want to shout out to the JS Team for their work on the https://liquidations.makerdao.com/ frontend. All the LP Tokens are up on that. So if there are any liquidations, you\u2019ll see them there. Regarding this week\u2019s executive, we have the 500 million Global DC increase. There\u2019s a forum post on that for context. Another thing is the Architectural Debt Cleanup. This concerns us moving stablecoins from Flippers to Clippers. Basically, we are keeping liquidations turned off by disabling the Clipper contract. It\u2019s mostly a move around removing architectural debt so that we don\u2019t have to maintain the old contracts. With this, we are ensuring that everything is now on the new Liq 2.0 contract. It\u2019s better for us than having different collateral types split across various contracts. I hope it\u2019s all clear but feel free to ask questions. Concerning work on L2 this week, we have been speaking with Optimism. @Chris and the team are in the process of upgrading the DAI-Optimism Bridge to the new Optimism ERC-20 Bridge standard. We are also working on them and other L2 initiatives with regards to token bridge standards. We are trying to align on a common standard which will hopefully move forward in the same direction. We began working with auditors and hope to have that continue for the rest of the month. We discussed the DAI-Arbitrum bridge with Arbitrum. We also had an exploratory discussion with Starkware regarding Starknet. As you saw from the forum post last week, we have a backlog story concerning setting up the risk framework. We are trying to align the technical and economic risk across L2\u2019s. We hope to share more news on that with you soon. Regarding Smart Contract Technical Assessments, last week we had Centrifuge RWAs, which are managed by MIP22 but interfaced with the Maker Protocol through MIP21. This includes Fortunafi, People\u2019s Company, Harbor Trade Credit, and ConsolFreight. Today, @hexonaut did a review on the Sushiswap LP pairs, which are AAVE-ETH, YFI-ETH and LINK-ETH. We are waiting on the MasterChefV2 deployment to launch the SushiJoin adapter. Feel free to ask any questions.  LongForWisdom: I would like to add that the post on L2\u2019s was much appreciated.     Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 11:20  Yesterday, we had a Launch Pod Session for the Oracles Core Unit. With lots of interesting questions, that went pretty well. The recording is on YouTube. On the governance side, we have a proposal from yEarn to get whitelisted on UNI, LINK, AAVE, and COMP OSMs. They want to set up more delegated Vaults as their users would provide them UNI, LINK, AAVE, or COMP. yEarn would borrow DAI against those Vaults and manage the positions actively using DAI to earn yield for the users. It\u2019s the same contract that they have been using for ETH, Bitcoin, and YFI. Polls concerning this will go up next Monday and should get to the executive the following Friday.   Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 13:38  We posted three Sushi LP evaluations last week. We will do a final one soon, which will be Sushi LP paired. We will also cover xSUSHI as new collateral. We suggested only one million DC per pair, and we also suggest increasing it as soon as we have a week or so of testing. You should expect to see a higher DC soon, similar to Uniswap LP or potentially even higher depending on the demand. The Parameter Proposal Group, which I am also part of, made a post about newly proposed parameter changes for June. We proposed decreasing the SFs more drastically this time because we want to boost the DAI supply from other collaterals due to increased USDC exposure but also because crypto market rates decreased for the second consecutive month in both DeFi and CeFi. If Maker wants to remain competitive, we should follow those rates. Another suggestion was to change DC Instant Acces Module parameters for all Vault types, which will allow for more frequent DC increases. It was also proposed to increase the DC of ETH-B to 300 million. However, with the condition of changing its auction parameters, which we did. On the same day, I posted a proposal to shorten the auction duration of ETH-B Vault from the current 40 minutes to 20 minutes. The idea here is to lower the market risk in auctions, which is a bit higher for lower collateral Vaults such as ETH-B. At the same time, we proposed increasing auction throughput for all ETH Vault types because we could potentially see higher exposure on ETH-B and ETH-C, where only 1% SF was proposed. Those two exposures could increase, and the current auction throughput might be a bit too low. We are looking for different solutions regarding institutional Vaults and the proper setup there. Nadia from Growth Core Unit will soon make a post or discuss this potential setup of institutional Vaults. We have been thinking a lot about this, so we will provide some of the solutions we thought about.   Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 17:07  The four Centrifuge Collaterals were delayed but will finally be published and polled on Monday. It\u2019s CF-DROP, HTP-DROP, P1-DROP, and FFT1-DROP. We are still working on the Trust structure concerning 6S and other collaterals. We are in the process of hiring law firms and are making progress. I published the MakerDAO May financial statement earlier today, which we will discuss later during this call.   Growth Core Unit Update  Mariano DiPietrantonio 18:26  We have been working very hard with the Polygon people to see a shortlist of implementations that they provided in the hopes that we can work together on auctions with their partners. We see a trend of DAI from BSC getting eaten by DAI-MATIC. We see this happening with the number of partners who are integrating Polygon, which is interesting. Beginning this week, we have a new wallet in Argentina called Bitera, which is a DAI-only wallet. It is a great wallet, capable of competing with MercadoPago, the biggest wallet in Latin America. Bitera is expanding to other countries such as Peru, Colombia, Chile, and Venezuela. They want it to be the DAI hub for Latin America because they also implemented a Linen chain and will implement Polygon along with other blockchains that use DAI. Our strategy is to have DAI on other blockchains and obviously on other L2s.   Questions  Frank Cruz: Genesis is doing DAI as an acceptable tradable asset. He took a sheep shot at DeFi, saying that liquidating Vaults does not warn, stating the amount of time you have to get liquidated. I wondered if your team is reaching out to companies like Genesis or Nexxo, etc., and telling them: \u201cHey man, are you down for 155% collateral ratio? Maybe you should top up.\u201d Is that something you are doing?  Mariano DiPietrantonio: We have \u201cinstitutional Vaults,\u201d which we are already discussing. We have big Vaults like Nexxo, and they have people that are constantly monitoring those types of Vaults. We are also working with Ethereum Push Notification Service, a new protocol that is developing quickly. The idea is to have that implemented soon. For example, on an L2, we want to tell people whether there is something they need to know, such as a change in the price of the OSM or anything that can be interesting and valuable for those Vault owners. We initiated this conversation last week, so it is all pretty new. Ethereum Push Notification Service is also a new service. We have to identify when it is an institutional Vault, in which they would have their infrastructure to monitor the Vault and other Vaults that may be anonymous and do not want to be contacted. Frank Cruz: What happens if someone is anonymous? Is that optional? Mariano DiPietrantonio: Yes. Part of the team right now is in Miami because a lot of the industry is there. We will talk with some of these institutional representatives interested in getting a DeFi implementation with DAI on their services. We need to develop their ideas and gather all their requirements because they have different requirements based on their country, the type of clients, and the services they are offering. We need to perform a very customed-based thing if we want to have them onboard carefully. We are in the phase of gathering all of the information. We will share with the Community once we have something to agree on the type of client type.     Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling  Juan Guill\u00e9n 24:30  1290\u00d7802 89.4 KB   1289\u00d7724 65.6 KB    Project X-Ray is launched. It is about talent onboarding. LendCo is working on that. We are also working with one of the 2 Core Units to be about talent and about getting the right people in the right places. Dog Food project is launched. It is about our own experience in setting the Core Unit. Ideally, we will document everything for other Core Units that want to come, set their Core Unit and learn from our mistakes. We have the office hours set already by Andy. Join us if you have any questions about SES or anything that we are working on or think about anything we should do. Drop by, and we will be happy to answer you. Yesterday, we had the Auditors Call for the first month where we reviewed our forecasts, and we are going to do the transfers very soon. Starting next week, we have the LexMaker Series, which I am excited about. It is about regulating IP licenses and anything that has to do with legal since LayerZero and Astrogator will be doing many things regarding that. Check the ad in the forum; Pablo has already posted the agenda. Make sure you save the date. We have also been working on setting up OKRs, which we will try to make public sooner than later, and improving our SES portal so that people can find the things we are working on.   Incubation Program Updates1295\u00d7742 80.1 KB   Starting this month, we have the dTalent Core Unit, which is what I was referring to involving recruiting. If your Core Unit has any needs, please reach out. The other incubation program is DUX Core Unit related to interfaces for Governance. We are talking with other potential-to-be Core Units. Some of them are super interesting, and we hope to have more news on those soon.   1286\u00d7726 65.5 KB   1290\u00d7688 169 KB   1289\u00d7724 86.9 KB   Nik presented his Core Unit. I encourage everyone to watch the Launch Pod Session. Oracles may become a crucial part of Maker and potentially a really big entity on its own. I am excited about that. Next week, Kath will present Strategic MarComms with some modifications that they have been working on. That agenda will be published soon. One week later, we will have the first session of the LexMaker Series with the Dai Foundation & Maker IP. The board members of the Dai Foundation will explain how to safeguard Maker IP, the overview of the assets, on the management, current licenses, guidelines, operations, and budget. We encourage everyone to join us. It will be very exciting to start working in that direction. The following week, we will have Stefan from Gnosis presenting their MIP6 application for collateral onboarding. I\u2019m looking forward to that one as well.   1288\u00d7732 79.6 KB   Dai Foundation  S\u00f8ren Peter Nielsen 30:53  I am excited to be able to start engaging the Dai Foundation with the Community. This is just an appetizer because we will have a complete call that will include much other stuff. Next Wednesday, we are hoping to host a call dedicated to in-depth about the Dai Foundation. Our entire board will be present. You may already know Wouter Kampmann and Jacek Czarnecki. We also have Payam Samarghandi, a lawyer from Denmark, and Hans Henrik Hoffmeyer, COO in Coinify. We hope to get more awareness around the purpose of the Dai Foundation.   Intro1434\u00d7775 72.9 KB   What if 11430\u00d7798 66.7 KB   With the current set of users we see now in DeFi, many people do not look at the underlying protocols to determine whether this is a Dai. As we want to grow adoption, we also must anticipate that many users cannot see if this Dai is legit. There is a real danger that somebody uses the trust of the Dai brain to scam users. If someone does that, it will hurt the trust and adoption of real Dai.   What if 21430\u00d7802 87.7 KB   That would mean they would reach the open-source licenses we have on the software. However, it is difficult to do anything about it if the copyright to that software is scattered among many different contributors. There is a real need to go and have concerted action if somebody uses the software for something that is not according to the principles of MakerDAO.   What if 31434\u00d7806 77.7 KB   We just saw the SES Core Unit talking about Maker evolving tenfold; as we get more and more collateral locked into the protocol, it will also become more and more attractive for an attacker.

What jurisdiction would come into play with Dai regarding IP and the types of IP law? If I was in Asia and I wanted to create YDai or ZeroDai, or something, what is to stop me when it comes to IP law?  S\u00f8ren Peter Nielsen: We have our trademark registered in several geographies, including China, Singapore, Japan, and some of the trademarks also Hong Kong, besides Europe and the US. I do not think it will make a big difference concerning the location of the Foundation according to how IP protection is done. It is a question of how you are going through and having the trademarks and the other assets you want to protect registered with the different jurisdictions. From my point of view, we have that. Frank Cruz: There are no advantages to setting up a Foundation in Wyoming or Delaware? S\u00f8ren Peter Nielsen: It is quite cumbersome and very expensive to set up a non-profit foundation. I would not recommend doing that unless necessary.   LongForWisdom: Can you briefly touch on how domains will be managed with the Foundation?  S\u00f8ren Peter Nielsen: We do not have all the answers, but we are looking to engage. We do not even know all the questions. We are very humble and want to create unhindered access. One way to manage the domains would be that whoever got to post content on a sub-domain must be a Governance approved entity. It is simply either through a Core Unit, MIP, or a Governance vote. A particular Unit is getting Governance approval to post content. Then through configuring that sub-domain, we could point to that content provider, allowing them to use that sub-domain. LongForWisdom: The Dai Foundation will manage the top-level domains, and then the sub-domains would be\u2026?   S\u00f8ren Peter Nielsen: We would do what it takes to keep full control of the DNS but point to vote.makerdao.com to whatever side that the Core Unit builds the vote.makerdao.com frontend is deploying to.  Hans Henrik Hoffmeyer: That is one potential scenario out of many. We have been working in the Dai Foundation to run these war games to figure out what could happen, which you do not want to happen. It is important to understand the Dai Foundation as a form of insurance; You do not want to use it, but we prepare for that scenario the day you have to. That is where we want to ask the entire Community to bring forward those cases to preempt them. We want to discuss them before they happen to prepare as an organization when they happen. That would also be good for our next session: to bring forward those cases to run some war games to figure out what we can do as an organization and if this is something that the organization should do anything about. There are a lot of conversations to be had. S\u00f8ren Peter Nielsen: It is true. Even though our mandate is very specific and narrow, there is a lot to discuss around it. I am aware that one big question in the Community now is how to get practical access to some of these assets. We are certainly open to discussing these ideas and look forward to seeing a lot of you next week.     Monthly Financial Report  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 46:10  You can find the presentation on the May financials in the forum and in the Governance and Risk channel on Rocket Chat.   1136\u00d7642 220 KB   Everything is great. We had 23 million of net income in May, which is quite an improvement compared to April. Lending income increased by 29%. trading and liquidation incomes went up as well. Work expenses also increased but not enough to make any difference. The only thing that decreased was the MKR price.   1140\u00d7638 103 KB   We can see that the bar on the income statement in May 2021 is quite huge. Looking only at the green bars representing the net income, we notice it\u2019s been a linear growth within the last six months. Please notice the net liquidation income here, as that\u2019s where we benefited from the crash in the crypto market.   1137\u00d7641 267 KB   When it comes to the lending business, I changed the slide slightly compared to last month. It\u2019s not presenting only ETH-A but now all the ETH-related vaults. This way, it\u2019s more representative. Dependency on ETH increased to 84% in May from 80% in April. That\u2019s the biggest dependency we\u2019ve had on ETH since early 2020. It\u2019s quite a concern for a multi-collateral protocol backed mostly by one collateral (WBTC is still the runner-up). The yield is a little bit above what it was last month at 6.2%, but that\u2019s only because the average yield is calculated using the loans at the end of the last period (May) divided by two. As there was an increase in the loans and then a big crash at the end of the period, there seems to be an increase in the yield, but there was none. The loan balance dropped a lot because people are deleveraging due to the crash.   1137\u00d7640 178 KB   Regarding the trading business, it\u2019s mainly the conversion from USDC to DAI and the opposite. There was a crash in the market, and people deleveraged a lot on the Maker vaults. As the demand for DAI was constant, arbitrageurs put some USDC into the PSM to generate DAI. As a result, all the stablecoins increased from around $1 billion to around $2 billion. The difference between the PSM and the inventory of the stablecoin is the legacy stablecoin vaults: PAX, USDC-A, and GUSD. That generated a profit of around $1 million which is quite an improvement since the year.   1137\u00d7639 133 KB   We made almost $10 million of income on liquidations. Only two liquidations were not 100% successful. Everything else ran smoothly. Please notice that we made more from this month\u2019s liquidations than what we lost in March 2020.   1134\u00d7640 147 KB   Crypto-loans are decreasing a bit, but the balance sheet size is increasing. The difference between these forms the liquidity reserves, which are stablecoin Vaults and the PSM. At the end of the month, 48% of DAI was backed by USDC. It might be a concern if you are following crypto Twitter, but we are working on that.   1138\u00d7643 325 KB   Regarding the stablecoin usage, it was interesting to see the stablecoin on-chain volume spike a lot in May. It involved all stablecoins, but the winner was USDC which doubled its activity. Concerning the market share, USDC gained a lot, and BUSD lost some. BUSD had been increasing its market share at the expense of USDC in the previous months, so the drop surprised me. DAI\u2019sOn the other hand,  market share is slowly improving at the rate of 13%.   1139\u00d7639 236 KB   On the risk side, thanks to the fact that many users closed their Vaults, we are now safer than ever, assuming USDC is risk-free in terms of the CET1 ratio. The leverage ratio (the equity divided by the assets) is slightly below 1%, but it still increased a little. The statistics for the CET1 ratio are symmetric but weighted by the risk of all the assets. All stablecoins are zero-risk except for USDT; ETH-B is double the risk, ETH-C is half the risk. CET1 is now around 1.5%. It means that we could lose 1.5% of our loan exposure, and we should still be fine.  (chat) Greg DiPrisco: Is this chart saying that the more stablecoins we onboard, the less risky DAI is? S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: It gets less risky as we onboard more stablecoins, assuming other metrics are the same. But there is a tail risk from having 50% of USDC exposure. Wouter: Why is ETH-B double the risk? S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: That\u2019s a decision for now. We are planning on calculating the real risk, but we will need a big study on that. There\u2019sUnfortunately, there\u2019s no literature on having a crypto-backed loan.     1132\u00d7637 193 KB   The MKR price decreased a bit. However, the recurring earning yield is quite high again. The equity per MKR Token increased to $44.44, which we could distribute to MKR Token holders if we wanted to shut down the MakerDAO project. The recurring earning yield (annualized income divided by the MKR price) is quite high but remember that we might decrease the stability fees next month if MKR token holders follow the proposal of the MOMC committee. That would result in less income and would change this picture.   1136\u00d7644 84.2 KB   1135\u00d7642 149 KB   Liquidity pools saw a large decrease of 25%. That\u2019s because Uniswap rates on lending pools are lower now as there is no Uniswap V3. Also, the crash and people deleveraging contributed to this as well. That\u2019s all; I\u2019m open to any questions you may have.  Wouter: Should we include LUSD in the overview of the market share of stablecoins? S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: The slide is taken from Dune Analytics who currently doesn\u2019t have LUSD in this table. There are many transactions on-chain, so you cannot start counting all of them so easily. The last time I checked, LUSD was 99% on the Stability Pool and Liquidity Pool.     Procedural  LongForWisdom 59:04  This is a gap week for MIPs and therefore does not include a formal submission for MIPs. Next week we will have a formal submission for June, between the 7th and 9th. If you have a proposal in RFC, the 9th of June is your deadline for submission.   Open Discussion  Maker Open Marker Committee Proposal 1:00:25  LongForWisdom: This proposal changes the SF, DC, etc. It proposes 1% on ETH-C and 3.5% on ETH-A. Does anybody think those are too high or too low? Should we be making other changes? Payton Rose: Perhaps some of the methodologies could be shared. We are looking at other people\u2019s rates but are not using them as our benchmark. In terms of the magnitude of how much they were lowered, was there any formula or basis that could be explained in terms of how that decision was reached?  Matthew Rabinowitz: To tag on that same question: is there an objective of how much new DAI is targeted to be minted by lowering those rates? SamM: It is mostly looking at the competitive rates and adapting to make us the most competitive option in the space. Right now, other secondary lending markets are more competitive than us. These rate changes are moved to counter that so that we are always the best deal. LongForWisdom: Regarding the methodology, the idea is to balance that against risk and DAI supply. In this case, DAI supply is taking the place of the most important factor, given the recent increase in USDC backing. That was the primary driver for the changes in this proposal. Regarding the amount of DAI targeted, we did not discuss the hard numbers of DAI that we wanted to be minted. It is difficult to target that effectively. The hope is if we position ourselves to be less than our competitors, then we get some level of migration, and potentially we get more leverage sequence using Maker over other protocols. SamM: Yes, and potentially attracting new users who previously have not taken out loans via the fairly big reduction in ETH-C as an experiment.   Payton Rose: I am curious about UNI, for instance; I see it was reduced, but perhaps not very aggressively. In terms of market share, we have an extremely small amount of UNI on the books and would like to see that going up more.  Primoz Kordez: The fee of UNI was heavily reduced because the risk is low. UNI is a very liquid token, and the current exposure is pretty low compared to the allowed exposure that we calculate. From the risk perspective, we could go lower, and in general, all those tokens which could have rates reduced more aggressively, which we did. From a competitive perspective, if you look at the current DeFi rates, everything is really low. If we go to Compound and AAVE, rates are much lower than they were one or two months ago. If you put the incentives on top, it is hard to compete. Before, if you borrowed DAI, the net rate you pay may be less than 1%, and at some points, you were even rewarded. It is hard to compete. We need to go very low. SamM: We still have an advantage in terms of large amounts of borrowing as well as predictability of fees. They can spike on AAVE and Compound based on unexpected market conditions.   LongForWisdom: We had discussed but did not end up explicitly proposing fixing the rates in some of these Vaults for a period of time. We discussed this mostly around ETH-C, fixing the ETH-C rates in the hope of attracting users who are not leverage seekers but are seeking credits more sustainably. They cannot do that unless they have confidence that the rate will be fixed for a period of time. That might be worthwhile for the Community to think about more generally outside of that group because it represents a change of direction, something we have not done before.  Primoz Kordez: It is a double-edged sword. We could see a lot of ETH-A refinance to ETH-C. Last time I checked, how many collateralized Vaults could migrate to ETH-C just because the rate is now low. You could see that one billion out of the 1.6 could easily migrate to ETH-C because their collateralization ratios are high, above 250 to 300%. This affects revenues, and it does not add anything to DAI supply, which is our main goal.     Next Governance Facilitator  Juan Guill\u00e9n: Super controversial topic: Should we speak about Payton Rose becoming a Governance Facilitator next?  LongForWisdom: We definitely can do it. It is always fun to embarrass first. Does anybody have any comments? Derek: Prose has our full support. LongForWisdom: We will see how that comes out in the June cycle, but I hope everyone will support Prose.     Anonymous Question Box 1:09:36  LongForWisdom: We can take a look at the anonymous question box. Did we get any interesting comments, questions, suggestions?  Payton Rose: Yes. We did get one which we did not have the time to answer. The question involved Oracle\u2019s performance during the crash two weeks ago. What would have happened if the ETH price had continued to crash while our OSM is an hour behind? This also pointed out some price fluctuations compared to other exchange oracles, but I think we discussed that aspect of it in our previous call. However, it might be worth discussing how the protocol defends itself or what takes place should prices keep dropping during that hour to the point where we cannot recover the debt at the Vault. There is also a suggestion of us using Chainlink oracles if we want to get Nik fired up. LongForWisdom: It overviews the falling price auctions and tries to hopefully reduce that more quickly than the actual market price and clear the debts above before the protocol loses money. This is not guaranteed. In general, as long as most auctions end successfully because of the penalty in aggregates, the vertical should end up ahead unless many Vaults have been liquidated if the price continues dropping to a very extreme level. It is worth noting that the OSM is a double-edged sword; It makes the protocol slower to update market prices, but we have also seen it positively attracting Vault users to Maker and defense against Oracle attacks. This is the key reason that it exists. Primoz Kordez: There is a risk at auctions. That is why we are not proposing to lower the auction duration for ETH-B. I have made the post regarding whether you want to make auctions clear faster, you have this delayed bids risk where you could clear it out and settle them lower, but there would be a loss for other Vaults of the protocol. Ideally, we want the auctions to settle on the first minute that the price updates, but it is always risky. We will be decreasing the settlement time, but we need to see high Keeper participation. We need to be sure this works out well. The first step is doing it for ETH-B. I imagine we can do the same for other collaterals, and after that, we can shorten this duration that is on top of the OSM delay, which can be one hour or more at some points. As Long mentioned, this has lots of benefits. It showed 600 million should have been liquidated on Sunday, but then 50 or 80 million of them save themselves because of the OSM. These users probably like OSM. It saves DAI as well.   LongForWisdom: We have this anonymous question box for anybody who cannot attend or isn\u2019t able to speak on the mic. Feel free to use it.

Forum at a Glance Forum at a Glance: November 11 - 18  Team-led Discussions  Bear Market Market Condition Prep  Are We Prepared? How Do We Prepare?  PSM gets filled during bear markets because people rush to repay loans.  But how high can we afford to go in USDC on centralized stablecoins? People will liquidate volatile positions to less risky assets.   Bear market may drop yields during farming and reduce stablecoin saving/lending due to increased risk.  A stablecoin unwinding is a low-chance possibility.   Any immediate spike in demand will deflate over time as fear alleviates in the markets. Have there been any simulations created for multiple collaterals over time in bear markets?  Primoz: Yes, you can simulate that yourself in the Risk Dashboard. We began developing a framework called Asset Liability Management.   Some assets like renBTC and UniV2 are difficult to liquidate large vaults.  These assets are not ready for a giant liquidation wave. Auction demo keeper did not perform well. PE CU is trying to work with UniV3 to handle such a situation and add a good liquidator.   Things to do to be prepared: update liquidation keepers. However, liquidating large Vaults would take way too long, which provides potential open market risk.  Liquidating smaller chunks allows borrowers to save themselves.     What Happens in the Event of Sudden Loss or Invalidation of Collateral?  Emergency Playbook by Davidutro:  During an emergency, the following occurs:  Communications coordination. Technical coordination. General coordination. Etc coordination.   The Emergency Playbook documents and connects all coordination processes as clearly and successfully as possible.   It is important to communicate and get auction keepers to participate in auctions during such bad events. Need to double-check Signal Group and check all the auction keepers\u2019 info.  Make sure everything still works and who is active/inactive. However, keepers are very private and competitive about their operations; it is difficult to get any contact information. Profits highly incentivize Keepers.   Should new collateral types require a period of mandatory fire drills for their liquidation systems?  Test experiences help Maker improve and better prepare for actual events. We need to immediately update keepers for the ability to perform easier liquidations   What happens if we lose network access?  Losing access to memory pool or nodes causes prices to continue to fall. However, we have a cusp where after X% of a price fall forces auctions to be redone. We should have a backup network like L2 where we can source liquidity on it.  Wormhole should help solve this.     In the future, most capital will move to L2s.  We will need everything on L1 to be integrated and adopted into the new L2 world. Also, how long will it take for this to happen? Potentially, sooner than we think.   How can we educate our Vault users to use risk-mitigation tools?  Yes, this is super important, and Vault protection promotes more income because users apply higher risk.   Alternate unhappy perspective:  Market crash happens, and we proceed with buy/burn. We get surplus from penalties to buy MKR, but then the market dips even more! We end up with more bad debt. Will cause to reprint more MKR than was burned.   We should be agnostic towards what solutions to use instead of educating Vault users on all solutions.  Basic information is currently available in the community portal; more information is coming soon. Reach out to Content Production for any ideas and feedback on this.   What if, during a market liquidation, users stick to central stablecoins and do not use Dai?  This can cause peg to break highs.   We do not need USDC or other stablecoins to do a PSM now! We can do it ourselves.  ",

This is a broad topic that has many subtopics within it. I prepared a handful of slides to prompt us in the discussion. There are three prompts. The first prompt is: Are we prepared for alternative market conditions? What does being prepared mean? The second prompt is: What happens in a collateral bear market? That is the main alternative market condition that people are thinking about. We have been in a decent bull market. Markets happen in cycles. When markets go up, rates and debt ceilings behave, and Dai demand and supply behave one way. When things go down, it behaves a different way. It is better to start with prompt 2. What happens in an alternative market condition like a bear market? How does Dai supply behave? It is understood that when people\u2019s collateral is falling, people rush to add more collateral or buy Dai off the markets to repay their positions. In a bear market, Dai demand becomes excessively strong. With the introduction of the PSM this year, it has been okay for the peg because we have a few billion of buffer to eat that extra Dai demand. Does anybody have other views that we might not be considered for what happens in a bear market? What happens after the PSMs get drained? What are our fallback levers?  17:37  Kirk: In a bear market, the PSMs do not get drained. They get filled because Dai is above Peg, and people will fire in USDC to mint cheap Dai and then sell it towards the peg. That is why we have got to 60% USDC in the first place. We already know what happens in a bear market. That is what we experienced after Black Thursday with Dai persistently above the peg, resulting in the introduction of the PSMs and taking on a bunch of centralized stablecoins. The biggest concern with that sort of situation is that if it happens again, it gets even worse? What if we go to 90% USDC? How high can we afford to go on centralized stablecoins before the market proposes that we use the decentralized stables instead?  18:34  Primoz Kordez: I agree with this. The PSM is a residual of Dai demand and Dai supply from borrowers. If there is a bear market, people will rush to repair it to repay their loans. On the supply side, Dai minted should shrink. On the demand side, you may be going to see more people liquidating their crypto positions\u2019 wallets from volatile assets moving to stable assets. This will mean the PSM will grow. They have an alternative view of this. It is unclear what happens with stablecoin holdings in a bear market because most of the stablecoin demand was driven by yield farming. It is possible if you are in a bear market, these yields will drop. Now we are seeing them 10% higher, and it is possible they dropped to a few percent. In that case, it is questionable how many people will still be saving or lending their stablecoins at 2% or 3%. It might be too risky. Even though this yield is better than you would get in a bank, some people might step out of their stablecoin positions. This could affect Dai. A bunch of Dai is now on a curve. Imagine if, for some reason, there is the total unwinding of stablecoins. I do not believe this will be the case. It is one possibility. You could see Dai demand going down in a bear market.  20:34  Kirk: That is an extremely good point. It is a question of how big the different components are. Another component that increases Dai demand and bear markets is that if people think prices are going down, they do not want to hold something volatile like ETH. They might want to sell and wait for lower prices. After Black Thursday, when the Dai Peg was persistently high, do not forget that was before yield farming was even a thing. Compound did not start until the summer after Black Thursday. We had a high peg until then. There was enough demand from people wanting to be in stables because of the uncertainty of the market. They did not care about yields. They did not want to be in something that was going down.  21:21  Someone: We have a sample of this from 2018 during the bear market with PSY. We did not have as many tools for maintaining the peg upwards. People want to exit crypto in the early parts of the bear market. Things have gone up. Then they are going to pull their dollars out to a bank account or something like that. I see an initial spike in demand but, in the longer term, we could lose demand.  21:57  Chris Mooney: Our default view here should be May 2021 crash/correction. It may be a bit bigger, and some different things might happen. But by default, we should be thinking of that as the most likely scenario.  22:20  David Utrobin: Has Risk or anybody done any simulation? I know Risk does some sort of simulation stuff when you are doing risk assessments. Has there been a kind of simulation of a bear market across multiple collaterals at the same time?  22:40  Primoz Kordez: We are doing these simulations to calculate the risk premiums and the surplus buffer needed. You can go on our dashboards and by yourself pick parameters and see how bad it goes. You can simulate a 50% drop in a day versus a 40% drop. You can test whatever you believe is possible to happen. But this is related to risk. We are talking about bank management, and this is something else. We started developing a framework called ALM, Asset Liability Management. This is what banks do. It was not problematic for Maker before because all of our assets and liabilities are short-term. We can increase rates and decrease supply. We can match the demand, which is the Dai holders. When it comes to offering fixed rates products, such as institutional rewards or different retail fixed-rate implementations, this becomes important. We plan to develop a framework where a percentage of PSM would always serve as a stablecoin backing at Maker, considering the different scenarios of bear and bull markets. We plan to run some simulation analyses. Let us say there is a bear market. What happens on the demand side after considering inputs like the yields drop and the delta catch whales? You have Dai supply, which is borrowed, and then it is booting the AMMs. You have demand and supply matched, which needs to be subtracted. We will try to solve this. It will be difficult to simulate all different versions of next year\u2019s bull/bear runs and then suggest a reasonable amount of stablecoin backing in Maker that does not lead us to bad back management or rely on increasing rates if we drain it.  25:29  Christopher Mooney: I ran the Auction-Demo-Keeper in a Hardhat forked environment to simulate a market crash like this. I fork it, and then across the board, I drop the price of our assets with Hardhat down by  10 or 20. I have even done 99% to see what would happen. The current Auction-Demo-Keeper is set up to use Uniswap V2 liquidity. There were several assets. When I go and liquidate Nexo in simulation on larger vaults, Uniswap V2 taps out right away. We get terrible prices with that one liquidity source. Across the board, it seems like Uniswap V2 is bad for many assets. You tap it out after a little while. A couple of these, like renBTC, Uniswap V2, was not enough to find debt to liquidate an even reasonably size vault. The Auction-Demo-Keeper, one of the myriad approaches to handling liquidations, is not ready for a giant liquidation wave. I am building into it the capability of handling Uniswap V3. The APIs and everything has changed in V3, so it is taking me longer. We do not have a backstop for wrapped stETH, which is an asset that I will pump the brakes on for debt ceiling increases until we know that we have at least one good liquidator for it. We have written the smart contract side of both things because our team is good at that. We do not have the portion to run a keeper or put this into the backstop keeper. In a simulation, the current Auction-Demo-Keeper did not perform well. It performed very well on Wild Wednesday because Uniswap V2 was the source of liquidity. We might not get that same level of performance next time around. If you are running a keeper, please speak up and know what liquidity sources you are using.  28:28   David Utrobin: Is there a way for future keeper versions instead of relying on a single venue to use a proxy like an aggregator and outsource the problem of trying to choose it at the bot level?  Christopher Mooney: If you can tool up one version of the Auction-Demo-Keeper, it may make sense to integrate with one 1inch or any DEX aggregators. You can use their APIs to find the best circuit and DeFi and construct that in the client. Then fire that off at one 1inch\u2019s routers. It would end up making the trade. There is a good argument for doing that. You do not need to put together all of these things. We need someone to be working on this.    David Utrobin: The trade-off is that you get better pricing and better venue access, but it is less gas-efficient for the keeper.  1inch is good about trying to find you a gas-efficient circuit. At the point that we are, liquidating a ton and we have tapped out one liquidity source, I would rather that we had keepers that were sourcing, even if it was more gas expensive, that could find liquidity that would reclaim the debt.    Kirk: One other issue with 1inch is that their web API is required to be online. You cannot route through the smart contracts. If they go down for whatever reason, those keepers will be screwed.  This is the defensive debt.    Kirk: You are taking a certain amount of trust risk on 1inch. Maybe you want to have the ability to sell through 1inch, Matcha, and Pairswap, all three, and build more.   30:26  David Utrobin: Is there a way to build fallbacks into the bot? For example, if 1inch fails, use Matcha. Then if Matcha fails, use something else. You build a schema.  Kirk: The more you add, the more complicated and expensive it gets in terms of effort. It is theoretically possible.    30:47  Christopher Mooney: There is a keeper group being signaled for now. I hope that they will take over a ton of development on this. The Foundation did development on keepers. This played an extremely critical role in helping us whenever we had large liquidations.  David Utrobin: Are you talking about Sidestream Auction Services CU?   Christopher Mooney: Yes, I am.  31:21  David Utrobin: It sounds like an essential part of being prepared is getting the liquidation keepers on point. What about the collaterals that currently have liquidations off altogether? What about the parameters of the liquidation system in terms of the ILK and the maximum amount of liquidations you can have at any given time? What about the price risk? What is Maker\u2019s comfort level or approach with a billion dollars of price risk on ETH?  Christopher Mooney: From PE\u2019s perspective, ILK was meant so ILK could be a collateral type maximum amount of on auction debt. That value should approximate how much liquidity we think will be available for that collateral type on-chain. The global whole should approximate how much liquidity we believe is available for all of Dai pairings on-chain. Those are more complicated circuits that you could make on-chain. The rest of the ecosystem is also liquidating. Gas is probably costly. You want to curtail these a little bit. It is a balancing game. You want to liquidate as much and as quickly as you can before you tear the whole market down and you get bad rates. If those are capped, we allow the auctions to take 40 minutes to an hour to recapitalize. You have this 40 minutes to an hour buffer where arbitrage can happen from centralized exchanges and begin to push itself into these pools or from more esoteric places and ends up pushing itself in. That is the answer to how we set those parameters.    33:47  Primoz Kordez: The ILK, which is this auction throughput parameter, should not be too big, or the on-chain liquidity will be completely drained. We look it through slippage numbers that we measure then limit it. The keeper system also constrains it. If we only have an implementation with V2, although there is a ton of liquidity elsewhere, you do not want to have too high a throughput. Even if you have high throughput and there is liquidity, you are risking these cascading liquidations. You might affect the prices. These are the limits to why you cannot liquidate as much as you would want. It is not ideal. If you liquidated the largest vault, it would take the 1.5 billion vault on ETH-DAI about 10 hours; That is a lot of market risk. Imagine that the ETH price drops further. There is a loss right there. It is not as bad as it sounds because, in some cases, if you are liquidating in smaller chunks, the borrower can still save itself. If you believe he can react within, if not in the first hour, that he can still save himself, if he can save himself in the second hour, then it is okay. Because you do not liquidate and you do not have the market risk. The user still stays with you, and it is not wiped out. You still collect to the stability phase. But you need to believe he is going to set himself. Exchanges liquidate as much as possible. They do not want to carry any marketplace. All these factors limit us.  36:02  David Utrobin: There is a third prompt. What happens in the event of sudden loss or invalidation of collateral? This question is less related to a bear market but more related to what happens when a major government deems a particular collateral illegal or Maker as a whole illegal. What happens if collateral recourse is stuck in limbo for ten years in some lawsuit and we are just sitting on a few million dollars of stuck Dai that cannot get liquidated? What should be the response if recourse is unenforceable?  36:58  Chris Mooney: Can we talk about the emergency playbook before we address prompt 3?  David Utrobin: I am the facilitator of Governance Communications CU. A part of our mandate was to support Maker DAO with emergency comms. An emergency is a whole domain in and of itself. There are proactive measures that the DAO does, even before an emergency happens, like threat monitoring at various levels. When an emergency happens, there are five or six different emergency types. Underneath those emergency types, there are derivatives within those types. When such an emergency happens, there are a few different coordination tracks that happen. There is a communications coordination track where internal and external comms have to be drafted, forum posts have to be drafted, information has to be aggregated, summarized, and shared, impact assessment has to happen, and written on and documented. There is also a technical coordination track where the engineering teams and other key people come into a war room and assess the exact situation regarding the emergency. There is also a general coordination track where it is not just engineering, but there are a few different things. Our team\u2019s emergency playbook encapsulates everything into a single playbook with deeper links to more granular resources. We have a good first draft mostly done. It documents everything, as well as the processes for specific emergencies and emergencies in general.    39:35  Christopher Mooney:   One of these specific versions of the playbook should be what happens in a massive collateral crash or a huge market tear down. In that case, we have several resources available to the Maker community and others that are partaking or are users in the space to help with liquidations. It might be hard to spin up a keeper, but the Auction-Demo-Keeper is not that difficult to spin up. We may have a whole track of people capable of spinning one up, and they may end up doing that. People may show up and have capital as well, and they should use the Web3 liquidators. They can also use the session we had last week of the Web3 liquidator that uses flash loans or this sidestream one. We have to communicate all of that on Twitter and other people to participate in those auctions and aggregate information about it. Something may happen if things go wrong, like on Black Thursday. We spin up a whole apparatus to try and deal with that and communicate.  On the market event, which is one major category of an emergency type that we have identified, we met with the risk team three weeks ago to define what a market event emergency is. We also have a preliminary bucket of updated and outdated resources. We have to check keeper resources and links to auction front ends. This preparation is something that our team at GovComms is focused on. We are focused on building it out in a high-quality way with others involved in this process, including many CUs like PE, Risk, Oracle\u2019s, and more.    42:12  Nadia Alvarez: Christopher, do you have the list of the people running those keepers? Who can I contact to understand the current situation of the keepers? Is the signal group that you mentioned still active? We should double-check everything that used to work during the Foundation times and see if everything is still working. If not, we need to set up a new group or create a keepers room on our Discord. In case we need to help with liquidations, we can ask for help there. This could be private or public. During the Foundation, Greg and Joe were usually the ones coordinating with keepers. Do you or anyone else have these contacts?  Nikolai: The professional market makers who would run keepers out there are hard to get tabs on. They are not very open about what they are doing because running these keepers is like a war game. You want to have the best algorithm to make the most money. They are very intransparent about how they run their operations. With Maker, there is not a constant flow of liquidations. There are lots of opportunities in the market. They are always chasing after the highest yields. For example, in Maker, the person running a keeper would often shut it down suddenly because it is not worth optimizing their algorithm if there are only two liquidations every two weeks. It is very hard to keep tabs on because profits only incentivize these actors. There are many ways to earn profits and crypto. We must have open tools that anyone can spin up. We cannot rely on these private actors to run the keeper or have them up to date for a market crash. I know of some keepers that I can reach out to, but we cannot rely on them.    45:23  David Utrobin: Some people have voiced that our past experiences have been a blessing in disguise. They help us test in practice the health of the liquidation system. In my conversations with Unified Security and others, the non-technical side is interested in doing fire drills around emergency preparedness. When we launch collateral types, is it good to have standardized three, six, one-year processes to do some fire drills for the liquidation sites? How can we fire drill our liquidation systems better?  46:34  Nadia Alvarez: I like the idea of the grant, hackathon, or bounty. We should have the keepers chatroom on Discord. Explain how to run your keeper and have people answering questions and more. Our last experience with a hackathon was that the Maker protocol could be complicated for many new devs. They prefer to develop things for other protocols. We will need to have people helping these new devs or new keepers implement one, especially for Maker.  47:27  Someone: That is also the reason for SES. I am not part of SES anymore. However, I was part of helping incubate sidestream. That is to have a CU focused precisely on this problem: to have up-to-date liquidation tools for the community. Whenever a new collateral type is onboarded, we should efficiently liquidate it immediately, which is not the case today. There is always some tail risk because right now, the keepers are not updated immediately. They could also help maintain the Auction-Demo-Keeper and the documentation around how these things work so that the community can run it. They are not going to be like a keeper that is running it. They want to make it as accessible as possible for the community to liquidate these vaults efficiently.  48:35  MakerMan: During Black Thursday, we saw evidence of mempool manipulation. And nobody has talked about the lack of network access for all the tools we are talking about right now. It was unclear to me whether EIP 1559 helps us in that respect. I am not entirely sure what to do about it. That is the missing piece I see here. What happens if you lose network access? You will be dead in the water. If we do not have access to a network, we will not have any plan for dealing with or even setting up liquidations.  49:11  Christopher Mooney: If you lose access to the memory pool or the nodes, time will continue to tick, and prices will fall in the current liquidation system. We have a catch at a certain cusp or at a certain tau amount of time passing. The catch says that like 60 or 50% price, its forces at the auction will be redone. If we lose access to the mempool, the worst case would be losing access until the collateral right before the cut-off. Then someone would be able to fire through and take them for this cheaper amount. However, we would not see the one-way bidding as we did on Black Thursday. So, there is a bit of protection there.  50:11  Makerman: It was unclear whether 1559 would help. There might be a possibility that we could use an operative L2 when the L1 kind is not working well. It is a whole different mechanic that we would have to think about. We do have other networks. If we can source liquidity from them, we can provide a type of promise token. This token essentially promises that you will get it if we are selling and you are buying. This is a way to have a backup network if the primary network no longer functions. We might be able to source liquidity.  50:46  Christopher Mooney: Maybe once Wormhole is finished, there could be a way to use Wormhole for liquidation service. That would solve everything.  51:00  David Utrobin: I recently listened to a podcast that talked about provable fairness in NFT auctions. Has anybody been thinking about improvements on that side? Would that help with mempool manipulation? And is there a way to take things off-chain? For example, one of the things that smart NFT auctions do is they take orders, but not on-chain. They batch the orders until the time of the auction comes to an end. Then they execute, so the orders do not ever go on-chain. The execution is just determined after process and execution. I can probably post a link.  52:15   Christopher Mooney: Gauntlet had an interesting liquidation system that we evaluated when we did Liquidations 2O  that sounded a little more like this. I think it was Gnosis.  Q: You are thinking of the batched auctions?    Christopher Mooney: Yes. We did not go with a batch system yet, or for this iteration, because the protocol would take on so much collateral. At this point, we knew that waiting for any kind of capitalized keeper to handle this would hinder us. We have tried to leverage single block composability, allow our auctions to go around, and source liquidity from as many sources possible on the chain that it is on. This will get interesting in the future as we think most capital will probably end up moving to L2, and L1 is going to be a settlement layer for all the call data happening on L2s. If that world materializes, anything on L1 will need some sort of wormhole liquidation strategy that allows us to handle liquidation and settle it over a week or a similar course of time. There will be innovations in the future.   53:49  Kirk: In that world, you must move most of your native Dai issuance to the L2 as well, so the positions are held at the same place. The actual size of the vaults you can support on L1 gets highly constrained by what liquidity is available on L1. I can imagine a possible future in which L1 is 100% roll-up commitments, and everything happens on L2. However, I am worried that the market is currently underestimating the speed at which this could happen. This is a risk. At what point does the 50% of Ethereum block space become all L2 to keep an eye on? Then, how long after that until it is 99% and so forth? L2 has an economy of scale where they can afford to pay higher gas prices since they are compressing so many transactions.  55:08  David Utrobin: We talked a bit about what Maker can do fundamentally to improve liquidation at its home base. But I am curious about a different kind of approach. How can we educate our vault users to use risk mitigation tools like deep buy more safely? Also, is it a good idea for us to push third-party risk mitigation tools as a protocol? What is our kind of duty and comfort level there?  55:43  Christopher Mooney: That is a great idea unless we want to rent safe liquidations. Currently, we have a liquidation penalty intended to stop auction grinding attacks. This is a way of a collateral crash; a bunch of unbacked Dai is minted. We have this 13% liquidation penalty to stop this. But it turns out in practice that the liquidation penalty ends up creating an enormous amount of income for the protocol, which is a side effect of it. We should continue to think of it as a side effect of liquidations. Otherwise, we are too likely to try to rent seek that particular mechanism. As a result, I think it makes sense. Defi Saver is doing a ton of work ahead of time. This is a major feature for users as well. This delayed Oracle price allows them to see into the future and stop themselves from liquidating these services. That is a major selling point over other protocols. We should lean heavily on that or think about alternative liquidation schemes like B.protocol. However, we should leave the liquidation system that we have as the defense in debt. This is the Swiss cheese approach. You can make it through the first layer of Swiss cheese. Hopefully, we will catch you with our liquidation system after that. The stats say that most stETH growth is happening through Defi Saver and has automation turned on. This means that our stETH growth presently is being protected by Defi Saver despite not having a liquidator to service it.  57:37  David Utrobin: Good point. Nikolai also puts up a really interesting point. Vault protection makes us more money because users are more comfortable getting close to the liquidation ratio. I never considered that. On a side note, based on my reading of the forums over the last couple of years, there is high consensus that DAO members eventually want MakerDAO to have zero liquidations. As you mentioned, that 13% penalty is a function of a game-theoretical necessity to prevent auction grinding attacks. I have always seen support for third-party risk mitigation. I am less concerned about the rent-seeking part based on the views of the collective over the last couple of years.  58:38  Christopher Mooney: This is maybe debatable, but on Wild Wednesday, we ended up having so many profits that the burner kicked on hard. Multi-millions of dollars went to the burner. When I originally was looking at the graphs of MKR, it appeared to be supporting the MKR price. However, I was less convinced, so I think the jury is still out. If that was a happy accident, that is almost exactly the type of virtuous thing that you would want to happen to MKR. As the markets were crashing, this would support MKR if it needed to flop MKR later.  59:18  Kirk: I must jump in and give an alternate perspective. In the happy case, prices dip, the system buys the dip, everything goes back up, and there is no bad debt. That is great. But let us say the market dips, and we get some surplus from penalties. The surplus is used to buy MKR, and then the market dips a lot more. Something then goes wrong, such as network congestion or liquidity constraints. Now we end with a lot of bad debt. The MKR price is now a lot lower than what the system bought it at. If we must reprint it MKR to what was burned previously, a lot more will be printed than what was burned. We would have been a lot better off just saving that surplus for the crash. Thus, it is an asymmetric risk in which the downside is worse than the upside. I would just counter against the thought that buying and burning is a perfect capital battery.  1:00:32  Makerman: I talked with AES about gas cost and trying to figure out our emergency buffer. We were honestly thinking that the time you wanted to buy ETH is when it\u2019s crashing because that is when your gas prices will be highest for Oracles. We might want to reconsider what we buy with our excess Dai when we are crashing.  1:00:56  Kirk: There is a big debate to be had about how well the protocol should diversify its treasury because that is essentially what is happening. If you are taking the surplus buffer and buying, let\u2019s say, ETH, now you are diversifying your treasury into other assets. What mix of assets does not make sense for the DAO to hold? This is an interesting discussion with a lot of room for creative improvements.  1:01:33  Prose11: We will encourage everyone to bring up any topics that we have not gotten to yet. This meeting is nearing an end, but I appreciate all the people participating in the discussion today.  1:01:51  Seth: I can speak on what our team has been discussing in educating vault users. The best policies are agnostic towards what solutions we encourage people to use and focus on educating people on what solutions are out there with their pros and cons. We have considered making educational videos but decided it was not a good idea because it is harder to do. An evergreen video would be one specifically about how to use Oasis, but not Defi Saver. Then obviously, that looks like we are favoring one over the other. At least for now, we have focused on getting this information into their community portal. Fairly basic so far. I look forward to adding more information. If anybody has other thoughts, please reach out.  1:03:07  Makerman: I want to go back to the PSM. One of the things that had changed since Black Thursday is that the impetus to mint Dai before was a high Dai price. We do not have that impetus anymore. How is the PSM going to act in different situations? There were discussions previously saying that we might have different kinds of activity concerning Dai demand and minting. Given that the price is effectively locked, it is important to consider the unclarity of what will happen. There is a general tendency to think that the PSM will just fill up. Nobody discussed what happens if USDC or stable coins do not want to move in for the price. The peg then goes high because people value their stablecoins, like USDC, over Dai at that moment. If the peg runs high, somebody then might decide to take advantage of this. The real price that makes people move here. When you lock the price, you are left with risks and rates. At that time, your rates are not going to do much. Then, you are just left with dealing with the risk as the markets deal with it.  1:04:57  Kirk: I am going to jump in here again. When we did have that so-called natural incentive, we saw that it was extremely weak. There was this natural incentive after Black Thursday. Dai prices were high, but people were either too scared of putting money in Maker or just did not appetite for leverage to take advantage of it. I agree that if you waited long enough to let the price get high enough, it would have perhaps eventually motivated people to mint. That is an empirical question. The thing that we saw was that Dai adoption was being abandoned. For better or worse, Dai\u2019s integrators had come to rely on having a very tight peg. They could not tolerate from a business perspective a four or five percent persistent deviation. So, the market told us it does not want a soft page currency. It is not good for us. It is very hard to go back and reverse that expectation once it gets locked in.  1:06:19  Christopher Mooney: To the second part of Makerman\u2019s question, if the market wants to hold on to USDC or Dai breaks peg, high, there will be an interesting situation with liquidity providers. Liquidity providers are going to allow there to be an arbitrage because they are asleep at the wheel. If people prefer, let us say Dai over USDC, or USDC over Dai, or whatever, it will get worked out through sources. It is not until we tap those pools that we are in danger.  1:06:58  MakerMan: In general, I agree. That was why I wanted to propose, with others, to push for USDC during Black Thursday because we were stuck. We had no collateral that wanted to move into mint DAI. We also needed to fill a 6 million dollar hole. There is this real question of what is good collateral that is not going to liquidate? We put up one that absolutely would not liquidate. We set it to one and said we were not going to liquidate this collateral. Everybody was like hallelujah, and then we made it into a vault. I was looking at the gUNI V3, which has a very tight band that is supposed to move around with the bots that will post a new transaction to float that liquidity into a new band. But what if it cannot? Then you are stuck. The key liquidity that will source here is V2 because it will never go away, or it must pull. If it cannot access the network, then it cannot pull. If anybody can access the network, they cannot drive it to zero. Whereas for V3, they can pass right through that band and can drive that V3 price rate to zero-rate with that liquidity straight up. When you ask where the liquidity is, I keep insisting that we need to have a real price band. When you have a price band, you have fees, and fees will find liquidity. That liquidity is going to be there potentially to be sourced if it\u2019s in the right configuration. If you have to do a bot and post a transaction on the network, everybody and his brother will be fighting for those transactions. The worst time to try and manage your network and be prepared with liquidity is when you do not have it, and there is impaired network access. You want to have things set up to be ready when needed and not struggle to find them. In principle, I agree with you, Kurt, or Brian. During that time, all your basic liquidity is bad except for the stablecoins. You are stuck knowing that the PSM is all that is left, and it\u2019s pretty gas inefficient. And then you have a vault, maybe. There are few places where we can deposit collateral and find liquidity to help the price drive in a direction. It is a standing issue, and we will see what happens if it ever happens. So let us hope not.  1:09:26  Someone: We do have liquidity in that type of emergency crisis. That is quite literally what trust, cash, and Treasuries are there for. There is mitigation for that type of epic crisis.  1:09:45  David Utrobin: Is certain liquidity available but has no precedent to be used? For example, we have liquidity in our treasury, but what is the precedent for our auctions keepers? Should Maker protocol be one of the participants?  1:10:05  Christopher Mooney: Our treasury will naturally cover bad debt. Whenever we liquidate, it immediately comes out of the surplus buffer. The first thing we will see is a giant liquidation wave. Everyone is going to see the surplus buffer drop by insane numbers. Your first inclination is going to be Black Thursday, but you do not need to panic. That is what happens. We will then reclaim Dai from those auctions put it back into the surplus buffer. It does so naturally.  1:10:46  David Utrobin: I see that is going to trigger coverage and indications.  1:10:50  Christopher Mooney: As I said, do not panic if you see the surplus buffer drop in a wave of liquidations. This does not necessarily mean taking on bad debt; that surplus buffer was just hit first. Then, it will recapitalize if the auctions are performing well. If they are not, then that is going to become a really bad debt. So on to Matt\u2019s point on the third slide. We can roll our sort of PSM with real-world assets as well. There is this capability we have now that we have real-world assets. You could even think of a successful facility as a real-world asset and emergency. You could especially set one up independently. If Dai is going high, you can mint effectively unbacked Dai and immediately drop it on the market, which drops the peg. When you drop that Dai on the market, it moves through the broker-dealer that will sell it on the market. That then turns into US dollars in a bank account. It could also turn into a bond. This would allow for more downward pressure on the peg, even if the USDC PSM did not exist. Essentially, we have our way to do a PSM now. In the opposite direction, it is the same thing. You buy Dai off the market and repay the debt amount. You just got to set the loan facility for that to zero. We do not need USDC anymore to do a PSM. We can do it ourselves.  1:12:28  David Utrobin: Just to clarify, would that be empowering a particular actor that is already in our system to be able to remedy a market liquidity crisis? We would still need collateral, but we would be able to print Dai and then collateralize it by using that Dai to buy things like treasuries in US dollars. Is that the right way of thinking?  1:13:31  Christopher Mooney: Yes, exactly. It is our USD bank deposits if we use a facility like that.   Open Discussion  Questions 1:14:58  Prose11: I appreciate that reflection and opportunity for different ways to keep the protocol safe. Keeping an eye on the time here, we are nearing half past the hour, usually when we tend to wind things down. I do want to give people one more chance for questions or comments.  1:15:30  Kirk: I will leave people with one last shower of thought. We have discussed different types of risks and have focused on the more important ones for sure. That was the correct one to focus on. But there is a risk in the other direction. Imagine that we do not have a major global macro deflationary event, and the US keeps printing dollars to fuel this bull run and risk assets. Imagine getting to a point where all the PSMS are empty, and Dai is trading at 98 cents. At that point, our solution is raising rates and raising the DSR. How quickly could we do that? What if we get into the situation where we are raising, and it is not working? What does that world look like? I am not saying we will necessarily get into it, but you should keep in mind the possibility of meet-ups and meltdowns. We may find ourselves in that world at some point.  1:16:40  A: Let me comment on that from the real-world trust side of this equation in addition to lending out capital. There is another piece to this called the next evolution of the phases. It is indifferent to the scale of what I am trying to achieve and then ultimately changes the scope and scale. There is an entirely new level of bringing on a full-on bank revolver, engaging with the same collateral while they\u2019re segregated, and having a facility set up. In that scenario, if Dai went down to 95 in the natural market that Maker is inside of crypto and the external side, the exact reverse equation would occur. We would be refinancing the existing debt structures we have outstanding with another revolver, paying back 100 cents on the dollar to turn right back around and repay the loan that we had in Dai, buying it at 95 cents, pushing it back up. The whole benefit of using real-world assets is that there is an entire capital market to push that\u2014there is a natural arbitrage that is a Market Maker.  1:17:52  Christopher Mooney: Besides that, vault holders naturally want to repay their debt because they got their interest rate for free. Vault holders end up having a natural incentive to repay. We can also start to raise rates that will disincentivize creating new Dai and incentivize closing positions. It is not a rent-seeking thing. What we did not have in 2019 is the DSR. We can then also stimulate demand for Dai on the reverse side. We can increase the DSR, and then people want to hold Dai. We have a lot of tools on the downside. An interesting idea about the PSM has more automated governance around the tout. The idea would be to create this buffer. There was a discussion the other day in; I think, governance or speculation where you create a buffer of like 500 million. Suddenly, the tout starts to move up a little bit, giving us more time to react while preventing us from hard Dai market shocks that drop below 98 cents.  1:19:30  B: Yeah, I just wanted to ask because we work on that with promotions. But that currently, we don\u2019t belong Matteucci assets. We have a few hydrolysate sets very small currently. But if we get some Term Lending and institutional work is part of it. That means that we cannot raise the yield on those. Or if we do, it will be kind of breaching the document agreement we have with the institution And then you can be in a case where you have, let\u2019s say, 8 billion of loans at 1%, which are term loans, we are not allowed to move them for the next six months. And maybe in the future, it could be directly in the smart contract. Then you have the GSR. That is, you do not have anything else in the PSM; you increase stability fees on ECE a and others, but it says there is nothing left, and they continue to fall. We can increase the DSR. If you increase the DSR above 1%, you will bond cash because you spend more on Dai than what you get from the bonds or the loans. So it can be tricky. It\u2019s not a problem for this year, not for next year. But it will become more and more tricky going forward because you can have a material mismatch between the assets and liabilities.  1:20:58  Kirk: The PSM we currently have is instant relief. Once the PSM is empty, and Dai starts deviating below the peg, you can be in this situation where you theoretically have tools to deal with it. But the timescale of that response might be much longer than would be ideal. If we have large real-world asset loans that can nimbly move to lower their cost of capital, that could be one mitigation.  1:21:49  David Utrobin: Another important thing is something that Joshua just brought up. IAMs are a tool that governance can use to implement a fast change somewhere through specific permission. My open-ended question for the DAO is, are there parameters that should have an IAM?  1:22:23  Christopher Mooney: The short answer is yes. The long answer is that every sort of automation comes at the risk of doing it incorrectly or with some peril. We should be heavily thinking about how to governance minimize what we can, mostly because the cognitive load to just manage all of this is going to far outpace our capacity as humans to handle it. For parameter changes, it would be good to think about these things ahead of time and set up an instant access module that behaves correctly in all these different scenarios. But again, you got to be careful. We cannot easily set rates on a chain right now; the formulas are complicated.   Conclusion  Payton Rose 1:23:37  Prose11: Well, that\u2019s our time.

My name is LongForWisdom. I am the governance facilitator at MakerDAO. Please feel free to interrupt and voice any opinions or comments. We would love to hear from you. Today\u2019s agenda involves regular updates. We have the Governance Cycle Review for January. We have no specific segments for today, so we\u2019ll open up to some discussion and Q&A.  Weekly Update  This week has been reasonably busy on the governance side. I began working on Core Unit Proposals for the governance domain. I\u2019ve also been coordinating with other people working on this proposal to ensure our results are consistent. Once production is complete, it should clarify some of the medium-term goals for the governance, which we\u2019ve pushed off for the time being. We saw the Centrifuge New Silver Drop poll had passed an hour ago, and therefore we\u2019ll see that coming into executive; We can\u2019t set a date on this just yet. We proposed the ETH-A-DC IAM executive for this Friday. Primoz may speak on this later. Ideally, we would have a non-chain poll for these parameters, but given that the markets have been moving quickly and it\u2019s been bullish, we\u2019ve seen the debt usage heavily increase. I wrote up some governance-focused documentation for the DC IAM module, available on the community portal, and linked it to the executive. I\u2019ve continued to onboard Prose and Eli, which seems to be going well. Several governance-related MIPs will go public within the next couple of days. Prose is working on three of them. These include the DssGov Rewards, Governance Rewards MIP, and a managing multi-sig. There is possibly one more, but we\u2019ll see. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Updates Peyton Rose Governance at a Glance 04:32  This week, I did add a new mini section to the governance at a glance. I would love some feedback on that. I\u2019m calling it \u2018in case you missed it\u2019 announcements to cover things that aren\u2019t discussions, aren\u2019t signal requests, but should still probably be highlighted in the meeting.  Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated.  Three-Point Summary:  Total DAI supply hits another ATH above 1.6B. Debt Ceilings have been raised, and the revenues have followed! DAI revenue per second up to 1.30. The DAI VWAP holds steady (currently at $1.001), despite some severe volatility of ETH.  ICYMI Announcements:  The USDC PSM Interface is live with plenty of room before we hit the DC. Blimpa has brought Maker News to your inbox! Sign up here. They\u2019re currently testing out sending the governance snippets from this call and a maker relay version. Go ahead and sign up for that, and, of course, any feedback you have to provide would be welcome.  Discussions   IAM DC ETH-A Parameters  Primoz details the Risk Team\u2019s assessment of increasing ETH exposure to the platform and what steps might be taken to mitigate the risks.    Crash \u201cin slow motion\u201d scenario analysis  SebVentures expands on last week\u2019s VaR presentation, showcasing a different platform risk posed by the Box parameter.    Signal Requests   Adjust ETH-A Debt Ceiling  Ultraschuppi signals another increase to the ETH-A debt ceiling as vault users continue to utilize the collateral.    Raise DSR  Ultraschuppi signals for varying levels of increase to the Dai Savings Rate, 0% since September.    Adjust the Surplus Buffer  Ultraschuppi signals the Surplus Buffer\u2019s raising, with options to continue MKR buyback and burn operations during the raise.    Ongoing Initiatives    Calling all Projects!  Juanjuan sets up a signup thread for projects wishing to present on the bi-weekly collateral call. Know any potential collateral partners that you want to present? Refer them here.    Collateral Status Index   Confused about the current status of the various collateral types that have been discussed recently? Check out this post to find out the status and current position of each within the onboarding process.    Weekly MIPs Updates  Davidutro and charlesstlouis bring the latest updates in the world of MIPs.    MakerDAO Standard Governance Processes   LongForWisdom writes a brief overview of the currently operating governance processes in the Maker community. Confused between Signals, Declarations, and MIPs? Look no further.    The Official Welcome Thread  A welcome and introductions thread. Not strictly speaking governance, but if anyone new or old wants to introduce themselves, now is your chance!    Wanted: Join the Summary Team   Davidutro asks for anyone interested in producing call summaries to get in touch. Grants available.    MIPs in the Request for Comment phase  MakerDAO could always use help reviewing MIPs in RFC.    Discussion  Prose: Tim will speak about the signal request on Adjusting the Surplus Buffer. He can give a brief explanation as to what\u2019s on there. Tim Schuppener: Thank you for putting me on stage. I am @ultraschuppi. We are continually fighting right now to keep up with the demand of DAI. I\u2019ve been spamming the forum with a lot of debt ceiling increases for ETH-A, and basically, all of them are answered by people saying that we do have a severe issue with risk here. Of course, increasing only the surplus buffer is not a direct effect that we will see. Still, it\u2019s probably one of the best things we can do besides raising the stability fee. I would not go ballistic with a stability fee like we did last year. We had something along the lines of 15% on ETH-A. I would rather stop burning or pause burning and instead accumulate into the surplus buffer to, at least, hold up some of the risks that we are going to be exposed to. The surplus buffer is going to get filled in five to seven weeks. Therefore, we have plenty of time left; there\u2019s no urgency. However, just from the comments, we saw on Primoz\u2019s thread regarding the IAM-DC parameters and my signal about the ETH-A debt ceiling, plenty of people asked: what else can we do? In that matter, I have the feeling that it\u2019s about time to raise that question right now. If it\u2019s needed to prolong the signal, I\u2019m fine with that. We could do it for three weeks, but I don\u2019t think that anything will change. It\u2019s probably going to get worse. Prose: Thanks for that update. I want to highlight that signaling to increase the surplus buffer also gives people the option to vote whether they want a percentage to be still directed towards the MKR buyback and burn. David: This coming Tuesday\u2019s community call will hold a panel discussion about the surplus buffer, which includes a ton of people who are very active in governance.  Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 11:07  Last week, we had a weekly executive on the 22nd, which passed. Some of these are getting so long I\u2019m going to point out just the highlights. We added two new collateral type LP tokens, which are UNI-V2-WBTCF and UNI-V2-USDCF. The tUSD debt ceiling went to zero, and the PSM USDCA was set up to be lerped up to 500 million. Dust for all of the collateral types went to 2000 DAI. Also noteworthy is that this is the first time we\u2019ve done this with the protocol, but the vault compensation working group payment was approved for 12.700 DAI, and there was an oracle whitelist for Instadapp that got approved in that spell. Everyone did a great job getting on that. On Monday, we had the monthly executive, which went out and passed. For last week, we had two collateral assessments that Sam did for UNI-V2-DAI-USDC and UNI-V2-F-USDT. These two-LP tokens are probably going in next week. However, no collateral has gone to Kovan, and I\u2019ll make a note of this. We probably won\u2019t see this with the LP tokens because they\u2019re considerably difficult to get on Kovan. We need the entire Uniswap kit to be there and function correctly. We were able to do it with the first one, which I think was a good test case, but it\u2019s tough to create this for our test nets and Kovan. Therefore, right now, most of these are going straight up to the mainnet. While we are doing LP tokens, you probably will not see them going into Kovan. There was more review of the Dss.exec lib, which occurred last week. We did a quick check on a few LP Tokens that might be coming and gave them a short assessment for work on the collateral priority sheet. The other teams have been working on that as well. Regarding domain teamwork, many team members were heads down, making some updates to liquidations 2.0 and working with the auditors. We\u2019ve been going back and forth with PWC. We have another session with QuantStamp to do a full walkthrough with them tomorrow. We have a code frozen version of that, which I\u2019m going to link down *here. If anyone wants to take a look at it and understand it, there\u2019s a clip.sol a dog.sol, an abbakai.sol, and some changes in the end that are most of the relevant parts that you\u2019d pay attention to there. Our team was also heads down in review on MIP21. We went through another pass of MIP21 and then kicked that back for some changes. The next day, we grabbed MIP22, and we went through a pass of MIP22 and kicked that back for some discussion and changes. I think what we\u2019re going to do with those MIPs is that whoever makes it through that review process first and gets to the end, where our team is signed off on it, will be the first one that ends up going out. For next week, we don\u2019t have any monthlies. Hopefully, like I just said, we\u2019re going to put MIP21 or MIP22 on Kovan next week. The Friday executive for next week should have that UNI-V2-DAI-USDC and UNI-V2-F-USDCF in there. We\u2019re also working on assessments for UNI-V2-UNI-F, LINK-F, and AAVE-F. Regarding domain team reviews, we still have MIP25, a flash mint module that we have to look at. We\u2019ve got MIP30, which is the farmable cUSDC CropJoin Adapter. We\u2019re looking at both of those, and I think there\u2019s some other stuff I had not mentioned. We may try and get the Vox out because it requires just a light touch quick review, and then after that, we can push it out. Also, Let\u2019s discuss the keg soon as well.  Questions 16:32  Emilio:  I think it\u2019s important to mention the advancements that Tanner has made in formal verification. Chris: Yeah. The Foundation has a new team member, Tanner, who\u2019s been driving the push towards finding the right sets of tools that we can use for fuzzing, formal verification, and the types of security guarantees that we can give. We\u2019re hoping to apply that to the liquidations 2.0. Tanner\u2019s been pretty heads down in that almost tangentially to our workflow. Thank you, Tanner, for the work. LongForWisdom: Tim, would you like to read out your question? Tim Schuppener: I\u2019m not sure if I got your point. Chris: Sure, I mentioned that the surplus buffer grows off interest rates that go towards all of the various vaults we have. At some point, people need the DAI generated from those interest rates. They need to be able to find it on the market to pay down their positions. That means there\u2019s some inflection point where if the protocol hoards too much of those interest rates, it will end up breaking the peg\u2019s high because there would be strong demand for DAI. I know that the PSM is looked at to regulate the peg, but it would regulate the peg at the expense of absorbing a bunch of other stable coins. Therefore, we don\u2019t have a peg breaking high issue. Instead, we\u2019ll ingest more of the USDC in the PSM or whatever other stablecoins we put there. Just worth noting that there are reasons for that surplus buffer to hit the market.  Tim Schuppener: I agree. I doubt that the inflection point is at two to three percent. On the con side of the initial signal, DAI is taken out of circulation and hurting the supply side in the surplus buffer. Looking at the amount of DAI getting minted right now by non-stable coin assets is so big that I doubt we are near this inflection point. Chris: Yeah, I think we outpaced that inflection point by quite a bit over the last year. I felt a year ago that we would have seen this in the market but not today.    Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 19:41  Brian and I are finalizing the details that ABDK requested from us. We\u2019ll be packaging and sending that off to them to begin the audit of the LP oracle. We\u2019re all very excited about that. As we add more LP tokens, we increase our exposure to that oracle. At some point, we do want to raise the debt ceilings on those because, as we\u2019ve seen with all three of the LP tokens that we\u2019ve onboarded, they\u2019ve all filled up to the three million debt ceiling maximum in less than 24 hours. The demand is there. Given that we\u2019ve seen that type of untapped demand. We\u2019re going to be pursuing and aggressively adding more LP tokens; All the ones that Moony listed out earlier. I think this is the right call. However, after that, we\u2019re in this \u2018what do we do now position?\u2019. After UNI-ETH, LINK-ETH, and AAVE-ETH, the remaining LP tokens are not very liquid. The question is, what do we do after that? Do we try to start seeding new liquidity pools that currently don\u2019t have the liquidity to generate significant fees? It\u2019s a chicken and the egg problem. If there\u2019s no liquidity, then no trades are going through, and no fees are being generated, and so no one\u2019s putting in any liquidity. But if you can jumpstart that liquidity, you can generate fees. It\u2019s not that anyone has to start manually trading on Uniswap between DAI-WBTC or DAI-USDT. It\u2019s purely a function of the routing that the aggregators or even Uniswap users will start routing trades through that liquidity pool. That\u2019s an option that we can investigate. There\u2019s no guarantee we can manage to boost liquidity in those. Therefore, it might not be the best use of our time. An alternative is that we start focusing on other LP tokens. Case and point, SushiSwap has a ton of liquidity. It\u2019s a fork of Uniswap to use the same LP oracle that we use for Uniswap without really any changes. However, the caveat is that no one will use those if they don\u2019t get the Sushi Rewards. You\u2019re getting something like 80% APY on some of those Sushiswap pools. Most of the rewards are not coming from the trading fees. The majority of the rewards are coming from the Sushi allocation you get. Therefore, by onboarding the raw LP tokens, users won\u2019t get those Sushi tokens. This means it may not be desirable to utilize. I don\u2019t know if I want to call it out. Maybe I\u2019ll let Sam talk about this, but he\u2019s made some exciting changes to the CropJoin adapter that might make something like this possible. Sam, do you want to want to jump in real quick>  Sam: I opened a pull request to extend the CropJoin to support the SushiSwap Master Chef Rewards Distributor. I don\u2019t know if many people know this, but CropJoin has two pieces. There are the general rewards token joint adapter, and then there\u2019s the compound-specific strategy. The CropJoin itself is generalized. You can use it for any rewards program, including Uni and SushiSwap. It\u2019s straightforward to add in these different adapters. I have an incomplete pull request, but we\u2019ll use it to leverage our existing CropJoin, which had just passed in the MIPs proposal for SushiSwap. Nik: Maybe prioritizing MIP30 for next month, which is CropJoin, might be a good idea. After we get MIP30, we can do it for Sushi and earn those Sushi Rewards. To give an example, I think the DAI-ETH pair is offering 70% APY right now on Sushi. If you let people take a 3x leverage on that, you\u2019re giving them 210% APY. You can charge a healthy cut in stability fees if you\u2019d like to do that. Those things have tremendous potential for DAI generation and stability fees. So that\u2019s the next big plane we want to tackle.   Going back to oracles, another thing is that Uniswap, at one point, will release Uniswap V3. That means that this huge demand we have for our Uniswap V2 tokens could disappear relatively quickly. However, I highly doubt that SushiSwap is working on any L2 stuff from my conversations with them. I think the Uniswap stuff is more of a sustainable type of revenue, at least in the near term Mark Andre, one of the guys on my team, is becoming much more active and taking up this type of governance liaison role. He posted a proposal in the oracle forum to create 17 different Starkware oracles for DYDX. We are currently testing those, and I think the poll should go out for those on Monday. If the polling vote passes, the executive will probably not be on the following Friday. It would get staggered a couple of weeks because we still need to work on some smart contracts stuff with Starkware to ensure that everything\u2019s hooked up. That\u2019ll be very exciting because it will be the first time we do any oracle work on L2.  Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 28:10  Monetsupply just finished risk evaluations for two UNI LP\u2019s, which are DAI-USDC and USDT-ETH. Both evaluations are currently in review and should be published within the coming days to onboard next week. As Chris mentioned, we\u2019ll also be working on an additional batch of evaluations for Uni LPs. This would be UNI-ETH, LINK-ETH, and AAVE-ETH, and of course, these pairs have high potential because they reach high capitalization with high APY. It shouldn\u2019t be a problem for us to list them. I published a proposed parameter for the debt ceiling instant access module for ETH-A. I offered this change to be included in tomorrow\u2019s executive. We don\u2019t want to have another event of full debt ceiling utilization for ETH-A. We have an urgent vote because these are pretty annoying for the smart contracts team, of course, and for business-related reasons. They also mentioned the increases in debt exposure on ETH-A might lead to us increasing rates more aggressively because this will be our only tool to compensate for increased risk if we won\u2019t be limiting debt growth with debt ceilings. It\u2019s less likely to increase surplus buffer in the short term or even box parameter or liquidations 2.0 because it won\u2019t be released this month. Rates are our only tool to lower debt exposure growth if it starts ballooning. We\u2019ll discuss this next week. We have rates meetings, and the rates proposal should also be out early next week. We\u2019ll work on an additional set of debt ceiling instant access parameters for other vault types within the upcoming weeks. We\u2019ll start with the most active ones in terms of DAI minting, which would be renBTC-A, LINK-A, and UNI-A. Then we can have this module implemented for the majority of vault types. That\u2019s it for the week. There\u2019s, of course, a lot of ongoing regular work. We are currently updating risk premiums. We need them for the rates group next week. As we mentioned, I\u2019m finishing a budget proposal. I\u2019m planning to catch the deadline next week for the monthly cycle, so it should be out early next week or the end of the week. Finally, Andy\u2019s developing VaR modules.  Sebastien Derivaux Real World Assets Update 31:37  Thank you all for onboarding me as a risk facilitator under the previous framework and just in time to move to the next framework of Core Units. I\u2019ve passed a post to analyze what would happen if there is a crash in slow motion. Slow-motion is a term within crypto. It\u2019s still a big crash but slower than what we can expect relative to a black Thursday event. The news is not good. Even if the drop is small every hour, we still lose a lot of money, but we can hope that some people will manage their vault. If the gas price is not too high, it will end well for us. The good thing is when the simulation shows that we earn a lot of money. Earlier this month, when there is volatility, either we earned a lot of money or lost a lot. Each time it\u2019s different. Regarding RWAs, we have published the Centrifuge contract documents. We studied all the Centrifuge assets documents concerning New silver and ConsoleFreight, which will be released soon. There are more than 100 pages of contracts, and we haven\u2019t seen any stoppers in them. There\u2019s some small stuff to figure out. I want to point out that everything currently being done for New silver and ConsolFreight is for small experiments. Small being less than five million, just like we do for the PSM and UNI LP. when we grow to a bigger experiment of collateral types, even if New Silver increased the depth exposure, we would add new layers of securities exists. We are working to find how we can increase or scale RWAs because there are still many issues that need to be solved. We are working on the legal implications of scaling the RWAs and how we can lend for the long-term to provide capital for other types of real-world collaterals and third-party providers managing portfolio RWAs. These will decrease the load on MakerDAO and help move the exposure or the load to the third party, which will allow us to increase the scale of RWAs without being a huge bank. Something like that will be published soon regarding workflow for Asset Originator. It isn\u2019t very easy for our necessary originators from traditional finance to understand how MakerDAO functions and the governance polls and everything. It\u2019s always a bit messy to discuss with them because there was no clear framework. Lastly, we had many meetings with collateral prospects under evaluation and other people that can help us shape how we can grow MakerDAO, at least when dealing with traditional finance. That leads to the Core Unit proposal I have published in the forum. There is one difference between RWAs, which is moving to Real World finance. It\u2019s a small difference to include some other stuff we are working on, usually concepts in traditional finance but are not used in Defi. For instance, all the things related to accounting and knowing if there is some DAI in the surplus buffer are mainly the implication of these questions. There is a meeting next week on Tuesday. Also, we want to make the interface with traditional finance. While we grow, I expect that MakerDAO will have more interaction with conventional finance with financial institutions. We already have contacts with them to have an interface and work in the same language because there is a big issue on the language barrier between traditional finance and DeFi. In the current proposal, there is one sentence to explain how governance can influence the Core Unit\u2019s work. This is key, at least for this Core Unit providing competencies, but we can work on what governance thinks is a good thing. Any input is always welcome because we want to work for the DAO, whatever that means.  Amy Jung & Juan Operational Support Update 37:55  As I mentioned last week, we\u2019re going to combine powers, which means I\u2019ll be giving the update this week. Next week, Juan will be speaking, and vice versa. Before I begin, I want to give Juan a chance to say something, given he\u2019s now our newly mandated operational support joining me. We have two facilitators, myself and him, Juan do you want to say something?  Juan: I think we\u2019re happy to be here and form a part of this community. I believe that the people I\u2019ve interacted with already know my passion and enthusiasm. I don\u2019t know what else to say, to be honest.   Awesome. There are two main things when it comes to collateral onboarding. In the calls that we did for collateral onboarding last week, we had Lido protocol, which is building on the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain. Users can earn staking rewards. This upcoming week is Reinno tokenized RWA that are giving loan collateral tokenized real estate assets as the collateral for a loan. That\u2019s going to be happening in next week\u2019s call. Lots are happening on the Core Unit. Our domain as well as seen lots of work on the proposal. We\u2019re hoping to get it in by the 3rd. You\u2019ll be seeing something slightly more polished than what we originally put in with our MIP28. I did post a TLDR Core Unit. This gives you the super \u201clong to didn\u2019t read.\u201d However, you should read all of the frameworks and give feedback on them. It will provide you with the short story of the submission requirements, the processes, and the time frames. I know it is hard to keep up with governance timelines, but the main takeaway is that it takes about two months to go through. One month is the minimum for a request for comment (RFC), and then it goes into the monthly cycle. February 3rd is the timeline for getting it into the March cycle, which would be ratified at the end of March. The next one is April. As Seb has mentioned, a few Core Unit proposals are coming in already. I saw that some people started giving feedback, which is always great. As far as RWAs, smart contracts also put one in the chat centered around what they\u2019re thinking. Theirs is thorough in terms of their team philosophy. You\u2019ll see a variety of different applications and details. Then, we\u2019ll be submitting one for operational support, and Primoz will go for it. - - You can join the #core-unit-operating-model-onboarding rocket chat channel. That\u2019s where you can post something before you make it a MIP. This is great if you want to discuss a Core Unit you want to work on. That being said, there is also this Core Units I wish existed post that IMEO recently posted, which is great for brainstorming and giving feedback on things that you want to initiate a Core Unit for but maybe you necessarily don\u2019t want to start that Core Unit. This youtube video is a recording of the Core Units overview, including this blockchain accounting service called accountable.dk from Dennis. He talks about incorporating employee payments, taxes, fiat payments of what you might have encompassed a blockchain company if you\u2019re thinking about starting a core unit as well\u2014highly recommended. It\u2019s super useful. You can always reach out to him for more questions as well. On behalf of operational support, we\u2019ll be gathering services that we hear\u2014for example, Dennis, one of them. We\u2019ll also have Opolis. You\u2019ll see a stream of people who might present their services to offer facilitators or contributors working in the DAO. Last but not least, we have a Know your MIP number four that\u2019s going to focus on keg streaming payments. The first half will be Prose presenting the non-technical side. A MIP is coming with that. Then, our favorite, Sam, will talk about the technical questions concerning how the keg may work. This might be useful if you\u2019re working on a Core Unit and have questions regarding how you want to receive your budget. I\u2019ve heard a lot of other questions around that. I Highly recommend checking that out next Friday.  Anna Kryukova Community Development Team Update 44:35  My name is Anna. Some of you may have seen me or worked with me in community development. I have a few updates for you. This month, we had many applications come in for the meetup program that David runs. We had 16 applications, and 14 were accepted. There\u2019s also a Latin American DAI action group that\u2019s completing its second quarter of operations. They will do a retro and provide more metrics about what that program was and could accomplish. Then on Tuesday, Seth and Kevin from Source Cred came to the community call with David. They spoke about some new weight changes in the forum implementation. If you\u2019d like to see that, I\u2019m going to drop the replay in the chat. Updates are coming to Substack, so if you would like to see updates from this call, we put together a summary posted in the forum. If you would like to provide more feedback on what kind of updates are beneficial, you can drop that feedback in this thread and sign up for updates. A team in community development works hard to put out a Maker Relay every Monday. If that is something that the community would like to receive via Substack, you can put your requests in this thread.  LongForWisdom: Great, thank you, Anna. Does anybody have any questions on community development? One note on the Source Cred, the weights are changing slightly in the future for the Source Cred DAI distributions. Hopefully, this won\u2019t have too late to affect individuals with volatility in the first week. Please keep track of how that changes and provide feedback. Please read up on the changes to try and give them a better idea of what we\u2019re going for.    Sam MacPherson PSM Update 47:25  SamM: There\u2019s not much to besides the increase on the debt ceiling. LongForWisdom: In the future, there\u2019s potentially a lot of cool stuff we could do with the PSM or that kind of paradigms like other stablecoins and other potential parameters we can fill with, right? SamM: For sure. LongForWisdom: Interesting to see how that evolves over the next little while.

This is supposed to look back on the cycle, see how it went, and then look forward to the next cycle. We saw seven proposals entered into the January cycle. Six made it past the inclusion polls and were successful. The only proposal that we didn\u2019t continue was the declaration of intent to engage Nexus Mutual to ensure that Maker protocol. The successful proposals were significant. We ratified three new mandated actors, and we\u2019ve already covered it, but congratulations to Sam and Juan. We also approved two technical proposals, which are formalizing the PSM and including CropJoin. In terms of voting, the exec passed reasonably quickly this month. Previously, we\u2019ve seen it go down to the wire, but it\u2019s good that it didn\u2019t happen this week. We didn\u2019t have any particular problems last month with the cycle. This is your chance to chime in and say if you disagree with me, but it didn\u2019t seem like any significant controversies or concerns. Looking forward, I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re going to see in February. There\u2019s a lot of MIPs in RFC that could potentially be submitted. If you are planning on submitting things in February, feel free to chime in. I think we\u2019re going to see quite a lot in March. We should be prepared for that, especially if we see budget proposals and the actual Core Unit MIPs themselves.  Charles: I wanted to have an open conversation regarding the former submission deadline because sometimes people forget if we\u2019re going to keep it from Monday to Wednesday. LongForWisdom: We should discuss it. It\u2019s potentially problematic for us to change or start ignoring bits of MIPs. For each of the MIPs that\u2019s formally submitted, we need to do inclusion polls. Therefore, having that open until Friday might be awkward in terms of governance facilitators having to cue up the polls over the weekend and reading through all the MIPs, making sure that they\u2019re valid to be submitted. Perhaps it doesn\u2019t always get done as much as it should do, but we\u2019re supposed to do that. I think Thursday would be the latest. That still leaves the problem of us wanting to amend the MIP or something in some way, which is annoying because it\u2019s a lot of effort.   I guess we\u2019ll think about it a little bit. Wednesday should be considered the deadline; if anybody is having a lot of trouble finishing anything and asking for an extension, that\u2019s fine. We can consider that as a case-by-case thing. In general, if you haven\u2019t gotten in touch with me and or Charles by Wednesday and you\u2019re planning to submit something, you should tell us that it\u2019s going to be late. Hopefully, that covers any confusion.  Open Discussion 01:04:40  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: I want to talk about medium-term lending loans with MakerDAO. After a post I made on the forum, most people agree in the community to lend some DAI for an extended period. Hence, currently, all vaults are endless. You can borrow as much as you want for as long as you want, except at some point, you will have stability fees that will increase if governance wants you to find a new loan elsewhere. That doesn\u2019t work for the real world because you cannot increase stability fees when you have an asset, for instance, like real estate. People need some stability. The idea was to lend for, let\u2019s say, five years at 2% or 3% or whatever and not changing it afterward. We shouldn\u2019t be stressed about the daily fluctuation. How does it change from what we\u2019re doing already? As we saw, we are lending. We are liquidating when there is a drop in the ETH or BTC price, which works well until it doesn\u2019t. If there\u2019s only some vault to liquidate, we make a lot of money we are all happy. We\u2019ve made 25% of revenues this month from liquidations, but it doesn\u2019t help to liquidate something else when it fails. You can have some fee-generating assets like Uniswap pools in crypto; however, with something like rent where you are getting paid every month a certain amount. If your Maker loan fees are lower, you know that with the rent, you can pay the stability fees and decrease your Maker loan. After some time, you can finish your Maker loan by getting the rent in. That works well when you have a real estate portfolio. If someone doesn\u2019t pay his rent, it\u2019s not a big deal. That\u2019s always the idea with real-world assets, which changed how we see the loans we provide to our customers. This idea may be a bit better in the real world because we are making short-term loans with the real world. Hence, in the case of mature, there is a 1-year notice in New Silver\u2019s case. It\u2019s only three years. They are building something or renovating a real estate property, and they are selling it. That works well if they can sell it. If they cannot sell it, there are two choices, and the same with ETH. If you cannot sell ETH at $1000, the only buyer bids it at $100. Do you want to sell ETH at $100 and take a loss of 90%? It doesn\u2019t make any sense. For ETH, there is no fee revenue accumulating to pay for the loan. However, if you invest in real estate, you have the rent coming every month, which will likely be the same every month. There will be a small variation, but there will be no stress to liquidate if the rent is there because some revenues cover the loan. For some assets, not for all but some, it may be smarter to focus on the borrower\u2019s ability to pay the loan rather than the collateral value on the day to day basis. That was the thought we had, and  Lucas was interested as well.  Lucas: I think you also have to consider how long we will be in a 0% DSR environment. If we start onboarding these long term loans and have 200 million DAI worth of 3% loans, we\u2019re then pushing the DSR up to 5% because no one wants to have DAI. or we can drive the adoption of DAI through the DSR. I\u2019m thinking back to how it was a few months ago. Still, how do those various factors come in? What do we think is going to happen with the DSR? What is the base rate that we should have? S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Monet is writing that our asset duration should match our liability durations. It\u2019s not an easy question. There is still some theoretical work to be done. DAI can be very long term because people can only redeem DAI at an emergency shutdown. Maybe, Monet, you want to comment as well? Monet Supply: I\u2019ll comment more in the thread, but I know that traditional financial institutions generally put a lot of work to ensure that their asset and liability durations are matched. If market interest rates move up or down, their position doesn\u2019t change too much. However, if we are still committed to continuously maintaining the DAI price at one dollar, we have all of our liabilities be zero duration assets. If we lend out money for long durations while the DAI price goes below one dollar, we have to raise short-term rates, which pushes down the value of our long-term assets. I think it creates a position where MakerDAO loses money when the DAI price goes down, which may be dangerous. Primoz: We are talking about duration risk here, and that\u2019s why RWAs would be more suited for short term loans. It\u2019s easier to control the supply and protect the peg. If you\u2019re going to use long term loans, we have this duration risk exactly which Monet has described. It\u2019s more of an issue. I would always prefer to use short term loans, but I know this becomes an issue for borrowers. Lucas: Short-term loans have to be insanely cheap for the money. They are insanely cheap on Wall Street. Monet Supply: Maybe a solution is to find people who want to hold a long term DAI investment. How banks manage their duration risk is they\u2019ll sell long term bonds or certificate deposits that have a long duration so that if they loan somebody money for five years and have a CD that they owe somebody back in five years, they\u2019re hedged. S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Yeah, but a surplus buffer can be seen as a long-term liability even in all cases. Hence, we have at least a long-term buffer, and even above that, there is still some room to work. It\u2019s an open question. I don\u2019t have all the answers, but I think it\u2019s something to work on. Matthew Rabinowitz: As an example, in commercial real estate, this is why transactions are a snapshot of the appraised value on closing and also why you don\u2019t do routine appraisals every six months or every year. 95 to 98% of the value is not in the dirt. Instead, it\u2019s in the cash flow stream. S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Having long term assets is always good to pay the workforce of MakerDAO. We will have some expenses. If we lend for five years, we know that we will get stability fees for the next five years to cover all of our expenses. All the vaults can be shut down, or the vault can be closed at any time, and that will leave no income from it. Matthew Rabinowitz: It\u2019s also an open question concerning what happens when the DSR begins to increase. What happens to the surplus buffer net number that\u2019s caused by real-world assets? It should get compressed because, as you\u2019ve outlined, the market external to Maker is efficient. If it starts pushing real-world assets, they\u2019ll refinance. When they refinance externally, the probability of coming back isn\u2019t so certain. LongForWisdom: If I remember your forum posts correctly, Seb, we were trying to figure out what proportion of long term assets would we want in comparison to short term assets. Ideally, we\u2019d like some of both because there\u2019s always going to be some base level demand for DAI. It\u2019s not certain, but you can have maybe 10% of the portfolio on long-term assets that we never think we need to recover 90% of the DAI, right? S\u00e9bastien: The post\u2019s aim was primarily to know if it\u2019s something we should work on. Whether the governance and community have already decided that Maker will only make short-term loans, that wasn\u2019t clear. The community answered that it makes sense to work on this subject, and it doesn\u2019t make any sense to make it if it\u2019s not a good idea. There are some issues with the DSR, but Monet and Sam are talking about it. Even in crypto, we have the yield protocol. There is a MIP to integrate YFI-DAI into Maker. That\u2019s already some medium-term and most likely long term assets that would be difficult to sell. The final price is always the same, but if the interest rates are moving, the bond price, YFI-DAI, will change this time. We would not want to sell something and have a loss if you know at the end we will make a profit. It\u2019s a work in progress. Matthew Rabinowitz: It\u2019s going to evolve into making sure the amortization schedules of whatever the ending borrowers are will imply that the principal gets returned during the term of the cash flow such that that concern you\u2019ve got at the very end doesn\u2019t matter.   LongForWisdom:  Okay, that exhausts this topic. Does anyone else have any other topics they want to discuss before we close up?  Chris: Did the PSM put Vishesh out of work? Are we never going to see him again?   LongForWisdom: Vishesh mentioned hes going to take some of January off. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see him back in February.

There are other opportunities like Sushiswap for liquidity but the rewards there come from the underlying Sushi which you don\u2019t get with just the LP tokens in Maker. This demand might indicate MIP30 is prioritized since we could start to adapt it to other rewards programs.

My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the Governance facilitator of MakerDAO. I run these meetings, and I\u2019m joined by a bunch of awesome Maker people. You are all probably a little bit sick of hearing me saying this by now. A quick reminder about daylight savings before I dive into my sections; for some people, this has already happened, but it\u2019s coming in the next few weeks for others. This meeting is defined in terms of UTC. If you are in a country with daylight savings, the meeting time will shift by one hour. If you have comments or questions, please interrupt. We like hearing from the Community. Please get involved. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Updates Governance LongForWisdom 02:00  We will briefly go through the executives and polls that we had last week. Last week\u2019s executive passed, which brings us the ETH-C vault type, a new vault type using ETH as collateral with a lower stability fee and a higher liquidation ratio. It also brings stability fee adjustments to some of the UNI V2 LPs. The complete list is on the portal. We should see that execute soon. This week\u2019s polls are now finished. We had the Optimism Dai Bridge poll, which passed. It confirms that the Community, Maker holders, want the Smart Contracts team to pursue Optimism\u2019s Dai Bridge as described on the Forum. We had the monthly MIPs Governance poll pass, which is good to see because there are many juicy MIPs included. We saw the poll to increase the dust parameter for most vault types pass. We were supposed to have another dust parameter poll specifically for ETH-B. However, it didn\u2019t go from the portal because there was an error in the poll that we missed until Wednesday, so we decided to skip it next week. This shouldn\u2019t cause grief because ETH-B is currently maxed out anyway. We had other polls to increase ETH-A and WBTC-A maximum debt ceilings. For ETH-A, the poll passed to move the debt ceiling from 2.5 billion to 15 billion. For WBTC-A, the polled passed to move the debt ceiling from 350 million to 750 million. This reflects the fact that people are sick of micromanaging this now that we have the Debt Ceilings Instant Access module. The rough consensus is to use the Stability Fee to manage usage in the future rather than strict limits. We have greenlit polls still active for nine potential collateral assets. If you haven\u2019t voted for these, please consider doing so. The executive this Friday will include the ETH-A and the WBTC-A maximum debt ceiling increases and the dust parameter change for those vault types. We will also have an executive on Monday, the monthly MIPs executive. It will include the final ratification of the MIPs in March\u2019s Monthly Governance Cycle. In terms of the Governance Team itself, we are working on a couple of things. The SourceCred payouts\u2019 funding is transitioning to be paid by GovAlpha, which is the first Governance Core Unit dealing with SourceCred and organizing that transition. A couple of us have been working on MIP0 changes to make it more streamlined, easy to understand, and more accessible. I\u2019ve been working on Liquidations 2.0 parameter documentation. Elihu has been working on the Vision Setting Working group. The MIPs portal work continues; however, not quite ready for showing anything new just yet.  Governance at a Glance Payton Rose Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread Three-Point Summary:  Another day, another DAI: supply hits yet another ATH with 2.85B DAI in circulation. The protocol has passed another major milestone, hitting 100M DAI in annualized stability fee revenue.  DAI Descipher is back to full functionality, showing a weekly VWAP for DAI at $1.002  ICYMI - Announcements  Artists are given a chance to win Dai and have some featured artwork at MakerDAO by creating a visual piece based on one of the original MakerDAO Core Principles. We still have two more weeks for submissions.  Active Discussions   NFT Vaults @Aaron_Bartsch points to Beeple\u2019s 5000-day NFT sale for $69 Million and asks how Maker could serve NFT vaults.  1, 2, 3, Blindspots check! Core Units we need? @juan asks for a conversation to ensure we are not leaving behind key assets in the Core Unit transition.  [Proposal] Petition Letter to A16z @iammeeoh discusses drafting letters to VC holders of MKR to encourage governance participation.  Signal Requests  Highlighted Signals   Increase Uniswap DAI-ETH, USDC-ETH, & DAI-USDC Debt Ceilings + add DC-IAM @NikKunkel signals raising the Debt Ceilings and implementing the DC Instant Access Module for many of the UNI-V2 vault types.  Adjust the Surplus Buffer (March/April 2021) @ultraschuppi signals raising the Surplus Buffer (again), with @SebVentures giving some helpful risk analysis concerning what a \u201csafe\u201d SB looks like for Maker\u2019s current portfolio.   Other Active Signals  Adjust ZRX-A DC-IAM-line Adjust COMP-A DC-IAM-line Adjust YFI-A DC-IAM-line Adjust PSM-USDC DC    Smart Contracts Team Update Christopher Mooney 10:02  We\u2019re expecting to do the address rehearsal with Matt, but we could not do so due to the busy schedule. For MIP22, we sat with Centrifuge and found a very good path to shoehorn this into MIP21 format. Changes we need to make are very minimal. We will review that, and there is a chance that MIP22 becomes the MIP21 collateral type. Their entire kit may go to Kovan early next week, which is very exciting. Security team review work is happening. Once it gets reviewed, we will release some docs on the roadmap there. Yesterday, we had the SC core discussion, and MIP45, which is Liquidations 2.0, has been under development. We deployed Liquidations 2.0, our release candidate 1, into Kovan. This is its own sort of bespoke deployment of multi collateral DAI into Kovan. It\u2019s not like a normal Kovan staging environment. I dropped all the addresses for the deployment in the #collateralonboardingupdateschannel. Feel free to check it out. Also, take a look at the config file. We made it easy to iterate and test. We changed few things like tail and cusp between collateral so that could see different expirations. Suppose keepers are going to test that out. In that case, they can try different things such as integrations, integration partners, or any UIs. Feel free to start using that or at least test the code. We\u2019re going to move on working on the Spell for Kovan as part of our staging environment. We\u2019ve worked on Ilk-registry changes for Liquidations 2.0. Quantstamp and PWC finished with their final audit reports. TrailofBits and Gauntlet are still ongoing. Several things came out for the clarifications to the MIP. There are also additions to those audit reports now that they have finished. We want to add that into MIP45 at some point. Long, we will be working with you because it\u2019s an informal submission. We don\u2019t want to change yet, but maybe we can submit a link in the comments to the poll request. There are no substantial changes, just typos, and invariants that have been updated.   1349\u00d7674 447 KB   We will put up the bug bounty program at the same time as mainnet deployment. I want to bring up that we\u2019re working on an issue this week. Which pushed back Kovan deployment. We\u2019re hoping for Monday. If there are any integrators in here crunched for time, please let us know.  Risk Team Update Primoz Kordez 17:40  We\u2019re currently writing a report on LINK-A proposed parameters for liquidations 2.0. Chris mentioned specific risks that will be addressed later in regards to liquidations 2.0. We\u2019re evaluating to set some more conservative parameters to mitigate these risks as much as possible. Gauntlet has also finished the report, and they\u2019re planning to publish findings on the forum sometime soon. The proposed parameters for LINK-A should be based on our own analysis results and the one made by Gauntlet. We might make a few adjustments when proposing parameters for LINK, such as, for instance, having a bit less aggressive price curve function because LINK has a high liquidation ratio. Next week, we should have this report with parameters released. I hope we can get enough feedback from other teams in due time. The other thing we\u2019re also working on now is a new framework for evaluating UNI-LP risk premiums and their debt ceilings. Nik proposed higher debt ceilings for some UNI LPs. We believe apart from auction risks; those debt ceilings are reasonable when looking at the liquidity of underlying tokens. It is harder to evaluate the risk associated with auctions right now for UNI-LPs. We still haven\u2019t had a more significant liquidation event to see how many keepers truly bid on these auctions when more money is stake. Still, it does make us more comfortable knowing that there were actually no zero bids for UNI-LPs at the same time when certain UI\u2019s had a bug. Despite low participation in these auctions, there was still some activity. Also, some of the UNI LP\u2019s collateralization ratio distribution is very healthy. For DAI-ETH, for instance, the median collateralization ratio is about 300. This is high considering the daily liquidation ratio is only 125, presenting fewer risks and lower liquidation probability. I think we can safely increase debt ceilings on UNI-LPs. We also hope that if we have a more significant liquidation event, we will see a decent amount of keepers bidding by increasing the minimum bid amount. Besides actively working on liquidations 2.0s and UNI LPs, there\u2019s also some background work, mostly on optimizing our risk calculations. We\u2019re trying to convert risk files to more robust settings and get calculations for AWS so that metric can be shown publicaly on web dashboards. We\u2019re currently working on optimizing slippage curves which are essential when making decisions on debt ceilings or auctions throughout liquidations 2.0. We started to use a 1inch API, which will probably make an excellent tool to measure on-chain liquidity, becoming more important. That\u2019s all I had for today. If there are any questions, please ask.  Real-World Finance Update S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 22:40  Centrifuge assets will migrate to use MIP21, interacting with MakerDAO directly. This will bring a lot of velocity to some RWAs. That\u2019s good news for Centrifuge and the team. We might have solved another issue we had on RWAs, which is the USD-DAI edging cost. People in the real world don\u2019t want to use Dai. They want to use US dollars because there is always a risk of price variation in Dai. We know this will no longer be the case. However, people still want to be guaranteed that using the PSM brings us stability with USDC. Through USDC, you have stability with USD. There is still some work to be done on this front to see if we should do another PSM for RWAs or anything else to see if it will work well in the future. I think that the USDC PSM will be increased. There should be enough space for the next few months. Regarding 6S and RWAs in general, I had a good chat with a lawyer who will help us on the legal front specializing in structured finance. After the meeting, the lawyer was reading the Maker White Paper, which is great to hear. He understood why everything is complicated with Maker. I\u2019m not sure that it was a compliment, but I took it as a positive comment. We have bad news concerning analytics. Last week I told you that in June, they would change some widgets being used. There will no longer be any pivot table. Currently, the financials for Maker no longer work because the front-end isn\u2019t working. I will try to see what they can do and other analytics platforms we can use to do that. It\u2019s a similar issue to what Primoz is facing. We\u2019ll have a discussion around this later today. We are working a lot with data, so hang tight. We have made progress on Fortunafi. We had a good chat with them and People\u2019s Company for a new round of negotiation. I hope everything will be fine. It could be difficult to negotiate on good terms with them, but everything looks great.  Discussion  Frank Cruz: Does the RWAs team see any risks with Dai by losing opportunities? We see new platforms coming on and new stable coins looking to bring RWAs into the blockchain ecosystem. You have Centrifuge waiting, and there are new protocols like Acala coming online pretty soon. Yesterday\u2019s launch of Tether USD made a lot of headlines. Do we see a risk here on losing those opportunities since it takes some time to get things going?  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: I don\u2019t think there is a direct risk for Dai because Centrifuge is doing more and more business, up to 5 million now and increasing quite quickly. They are still on Dai. Also, other competitors that are tokenizing RWAs are no longer using Dai. We had a discussion with Goldfinch that is onboarding RWAs, and they use USDC. That is not good news for us, but it will only pay at the margin. Another thing that can be important, and maybe we should focus more on, is to use RWAs to gain Dai\u2019s market share. Let me explain that: Many companies in Asia are using USDT for daily transactions. They are not using Dai because USDT was first. However, you cannot get a loan in USDT. Suppose we can find a way to give them loans in Dai, backed by invoices and inventory. In that case, it might bring some visibility for Dai to popularly utilized stable coins. In the U.S., not many people are using Dai or UDSC for daily transactions. They are used mainly for farming, which is not the best use case. However, they are using it for doing cross-border business in Asia. By bringing loans to those businesses, we might increase Dai\u2019s value proposition for them. This idea is still ongoing. Otherwise, I don\u2019t see USDC doing a business line on RWAs or stuff like that. We clearly have competitors that want to bring RWAs and not choosing Dai. Frank Cruz: Thank you!    Operational Support Update Juan Guillen 29:27 Operational Support Weekly Update: March 12-18, 2021  We\u2019re going to do EUR-DAI for the Know Your MIP  call next month in April. Regarding collateral onboarding; we\u2019re working on the ETH-C vault and RWF as well. We will have Bancor on a collateral call on April 7th, 2021. Then we will have a solid block for RWF on April 14th, 2021. For the core unit updates, we have revamped the notion page used to present the core units and try clearing more of the feedback we\u2019ve received. Feel free to give us more feedback on potential improvements. Last week LongForWisdom and his team came for session number 2 for launching pod sessions. Last Friday, we had Sablier for the core unit tools. On Tuesday, we had AccountAble with David, and yesterday we had Smart Contracts core unit with Derek.  Tomorrow, Seb will be presenting the RWF core unit, which will be voted on very soon. Next Wednesday, Seth will be presenting the content production core unit. Regarding core units in RFC, we have the same four. David posted the Governance Communications proposals to RFC. Please give feedback. Touching on interesting topics of conversation, we\u2019ve had a blind spot check. We also had a call yesterday with Seth. He started working on things we should cover, map the whole space, and analyze which Core Unit would take over which aspects. Maker vesting has been a heated topic these last few days, and we\u2019ve been prepared a post on it.  Discussion  LongForWisdom: How does Operational Support think the onboarding on Core Units are going?  Juan: It depends upon what your metric is. It\u2019s exciting to see that three core units took the first cycle already. It\u2019s going well based on the MKR token holders\u2019 reaction and the feedback we have got. We don\u2019t know how the community reacts to different core units being proposed, especially when moving them forward to the voting area. It would be interesting to see. We haven\u2019t still got any core unit rejections as of yet.

                    "content": " Other Presentations and Updates  Kurt Barry  Liquidation 2.0 Oracle Risks 37:00  Today, I would like to convey information on risk concerning Liquidations 2.0, which stems from some previous risk discussions. The case concerns a price reported by oracles that is very low relative to the true market price. This could happen due to an oracle attack or malfunction. You could have a flash crash with a quick recovery but the oracles still manage to catch the bottom, or it could result from market manipulation. In Liquidation 1.2, you have an auction settlement price that is not related to oracle price because of how the English auction price works. The Dai target buffer, box parameter, combined with an enforcement time for settlement results in limits to the rate at which vaults are put on auction. This minimizes your market slippage risk and prevents total liquidation all at once. In an oracle price drop anomaly, liquidations 1.2 is fairly robust and minimizes losses to the system. In Liquidations 2.0, on the other hand, the liquidated collateral is offered for sale near the oracle\u2019s reported price at the start of the auction. This envisioned scenario considers that starting price is way below the market price. Therefore the auction will be quickly bought out, thereby locking in some systematic loss. Further, the purchase clears the DAI target buffer (box), which is the whole parameter, and that allows more liquidations to immediately occur. The net effect of that is in the same oracle price fault scenario all vaults affected by the collateral will be liquidated in a short order limited by Ethereum block space. There will be big losses to the system. We are not defenseless against this. We have a 1-hour delay applied to prices, giving MKR holders time to react using instant access modules to freeze oracles or disable liquidations. Still, there is an increased severity if a bad price gets through relative to liquidations 1.2. The incentive for a malicious actor to try to cause this to happen grows proportionally to the collateral in the system, which is not sustainable because this put lot of pressure on the oracle security module as we scale up. While this isn\u2019t a new problem, and we have oracle freeze functionality which we feel is sufficient for 1.2, the additional severity caused by dependency on oracle price for starting the auctions and how they can be cleared much more quickly calls for an additional measurement put in place to contain the risk in Liquidations 2.0. Any questions?  LongForWisdom: Just to summarize, this issue is less in 1.2 because those auctions start low and go as high as market price, wherein 2.0 the auction starts at oracle price and goes downward? Kurt: Pretty close. In 1.2, the auction price isn\u2019t related to the oracle price in anyway\u2014it is whatever participants bid for that collateral. However, in 2.0, the auctions start selling near to the oracle price. A little bit above it, there is a risk parameter that governs that. If the drop is significant compared to the true price, you can still start an auction below the market price. Chris: One more distinction, in Liquidations 1.2 is that the box parameter is similar to a true independent rate limit on Dai\u2019s amount that we would request. That\u2019s because the auctions have a particular ttl or tau that needs to clear. Whereas in Liquidations 2.0, which are more efficient in the sense that we don\u2019t have that time window. You can imagine the extreme case being if we clear the whole, there\u2019s no independent rate-based time limiter. Therefore, all the collateral might go into this extreme tail-end risk, which could quickly go out into the auctions. Kurt: In some scenarios, that\u2019s a feature. Suppose you have a real market decline and want to quickly sell your collateral before the market goes further down. In that case, Liquidations 2.0 is better in this scenario. The system\u2019s dilemma is when a low price comes in, and the system doesn\u2019t know whether the markets have dropped or if it\u2019s an oracle system fault. Oracle fault risk is much more severe in 2.0. While designing 2.0, we had a Black Thursday event, and we believe that 2.0 is over-optimized to deal with that case. We want to begin thinking about oracle risk now.   Christopher Mooney: Imagine OSM price as the starting point, plus the buffer is less than the market price. In any case of that condition, auctions can settle instantly. You can liquidate more, take them, and repeat all in a single block. The extreme tail risk concerning an oracle malfunction attack, if that OSM price is one-way, adds a buffer of approximately 25% of the original price, then we let the entire set of collateral out for one-way auctions, all of it. It would be a very low probability risk but extremely high impact if it were to happen. Kurt: Whereas with Liquidations 1.2, you\u2019d have an initial wave of auctions that would get triggered but would then settle near the market price, taking the current lifetime of auctions left to finish, which is usually 4 hours. Only the box parameter will show the Dai amount required by auctions. Meaning only some fraction of collateral gets liquidated. After 4 hours, the oracle price is fixed or recovered. It is then left with a certain number of Dai collected which were wrongly liquidated. The system would be fine because the auctions should settle near the market price rather than the oracle price. This has much less severe consequences relative to Liquidations 2.0. So, let me update the recommendations from the smart contracts team. The system currently faces significant risk from the real market downturns and Dai liquidity crunches with Liquidations 1.2. There are aspects of risk that are better under Liquidations 2.0 than 1.2, which is why we designed it. We can significantly decrease this false price drop risk within the short term through a special permissionless circuit breaker that we can add. It will allow anyone to disable liquidations anytime the collateral\u2019s next price is lower by configurable percentage relative to the current price. This would be similar to how the debt ceiling instant access module works where anyone can make changes to the debt ceiling but is only subject to specific protocols within the smart contract code. The risk can be based on a threshold decided by the Risk Team. This is a simple module that could limit down-side loss. It can be deployed within a couple of weeks. More details are coming up in the code and additional in-depth information. However, we believe a more robust mitigation system should be implemented within the system itself in the long run. Everyone should understand that this can take significant time. We chose this plan because it allows the phased rollout of Liquidation 2.0 to simultaneously implement additional risk mitigation, which shouldn\u2019t cause any further potential delays. We need to keep integrators updated in advance concerning the planned upgrade, which will install permanent mitigations and give them guidance on repair tools as quickly as possible. Any Questions or Discussions?   Discussion 49:20  LongForWisdom: This would be primarily on the Risk Team to suggest a sensible setting for that parameter based on volatility?  Kurt: Right. Primoz: We would look at worst-case drops based on historical data for each asset along with a 1-hour window. Also, we would call a circuit breaker for each collateral type. Kurt: Right, Each collateral has a separate price feed. We could configure them. Potentially, it would add additional complexity. Suppose you have three ETH variants that are all relying on the same price feed. In that case, you could create a meta circuit breaker that breaks all three of those collaterals relying on the same underlying feed simultaneously. But the simplest version is creating one for each collateral. LongForWisdom: assuming that this is permissionless and price drops a significant amount, is anyone able to come in and freeze liquidations? If that were to happen, would we then need to turn them on again? Kurt: We\u2019re finalizing the design, but we have an idea on how we could make that reactivation permissionless as well. When the circuit breaker gets tripped, you will save the most recent good oracle price. Suppose in the future the current oracle price has a relation to that recent price. In that case, whether it\u2019s less than the max allowed price drop or if it\u2019s gone higher, that could allow permissionless reactivation. You wouldn\u2019t necessarily need a governance action to restart in every case. However, it may vary for unique situations. Chris: There needs to be a keeper checking the price updates. It\u2019s going to peek and peek to compare those prices. Every 1-hour, a keeper needs to look at those values and determine whether anything is out of bounds. It would have to send the successful transaction there. Otherwise, we would be in trouble. Sam: Can you freeze it with the upcoming medianizer price, or does it use the OSM price? Kurt: OSM has two prices: current price and following price of the remaining period. The circuit breaker is meant to be used when the current price is still a reasonable value. The following price will be the significant price drop. The circuit breaks before the bad price (following price) can be taken into the system. LongForWisdom: How will it interact or change the buff instead of freezing liquidations? Can we do that? Kurt: I guess we could, but that has its edge cases and risks. If the price of a one-way is coming in and we need to reset the buff, we must find a method to set the price back to something reasonable. Prices can get crazy. It\u2019s interesting to think about this, but then it gets much more complicated. Chris: We\u2019ve already had many engineers thinking about this for over a year. We took the final culmination of all of those studies. We sent it off to three auditors for proper audits as well as a simulator. We received feedback from integrators. The existing code that\u2019s there currently has been reviewed with a fine-tooth comb. Most of the changes we want to make are robust fixes that would invalidate some of that review and audit work. And so, this thing being on the side is simply an instant access module. It\u2019s the lightest touch version of mitigation to the tail risk that we could think of without invalidating audits at this point. We will cycle back since the impact is severe in the edge case, and there are mitigations that we could put in place. In the meantime, we recommend this solution. LongForWisdom: It makes sense to me. How would you set the buff in relation to the price? Say you have the freeze at -40%, would you set the buffer to an inverse amount? Is the biggest drop before the freeze matched by the buff? Not sure if that makes sense. Christopher Mooney: Yea, and then what happens in the next time quantum? LongForWisdom: If it drops above the delta, you do the freeze? I\u2019m thinking of a situation where someone knows exactly what the freeze is, and then it goes right up to that point. Christopher Mooney: You\u2019re highlighting the risk of this module in the idea that an attacker or manipulator may be able to get the price right to the edge, which is very unlikely in a malfunction. LongForWisdom: Let\u2019s discuss some of the things that can go wrong for the oracles concerning attacks or manipulation. Christopher Mooney: I assume there will be primary, secondary, and tertiary systems keeping them afloat. We think that if all of those systems were to fail, rather than nose-diving the plane into the ground, we would add a parachute. Does anyone on the Oracles team want to speak on mitigations currently in place that help prevent oracle price manipulation?    01:00:30  Marc-Andre: I\u2019ll reiterate some of the fundamental protections that we have in place. First, we have 26 different fees pushing prices. For an effective oracle attack to happen, they have to collude among themselves. That\u2019s rare, however not impossible, especially if the stakes are high. The risk of this happening without us detecting it is relatively small. The pricing information comes from more or less the same places, various off-chain or centralized exchanges. If the pricing information gets corrupted in several exchanges, that could be a problem as well. These are risks that exist. There\u2019s very little to completely protect against them. The biggest layer of protection that we have today is the oracle security module. This 60-minute delay gives us a chance to react if something bad happens. We know that zero risk doesn\u2019t exist. However, as you said, Chris, it\u2019s good to think about these types of scenarios and to make sure that we\u2019re protecting against them. We always have to keep in mind that things that are safe today remain safe if we multiply the total value of the protocol by 100 or 1000. Things that might not be credible threats today may one day become much larger threats. Chris: Under liquidations 1.2, if you can collude and create one of the oracle attacks, there\u2019s no benefit to the attacker. Liquidations 1.2 has a box, and you\u2019re in theory discovering a market price you\u2019re not going to monetarily benefit at least on Maker from manipulating the oracle price; however, under 2.0, if you can think of this failure scenario as if you\u2019re positioned correctly to grab all the collateral when this happens all of a sudden this makes it advantageous to try and perform an oracle attack. We want to steer away from any attack vectors that scale with total value locked. It\u2019s a good idea to put on more robust mitigation here to prevent that risk from scaling as Maker becomes more successful. We have the total value locked.  LongForWisdom: Sometimes, I\u2019ll think about it from the other side; if you want to clear and attack the oracles, your first barrier is getting what the quorum is. So, like 14 of 26 feeds to screw Maker over without telling anyone. If one defects and tells Nik or Mark, then we know, and the gigs up. Even if that all goes well, you have to be prepared for a governance reaction to disable the OSM. Then you want this last protection. Even if you know governance doesn\u2019t react fast enough on the OSM, you then have this final blocker that stops any drop beyond a certain amount and therefore limiting your total upside. I am not worried. Nik: There are layers of defense here, right? With the oracles, there\u2019s not just any one thing that you point to. Suppose you do have an oracle attack from the feeds and manage to queue up a price in the OSM. In that case, you have about one hour to freeze the oracle security module before that price takes effect in the Maker protocol. Right now, we\u2019re relying on the fact that you can pull off a governance vote in that one hour to freeze the OSM. It is not guaranteed that you can rally enough of the MKR to have that governance vote within that one hour. I\u2019ve been thinking about whether there can be some kind of permission multi-sig that maybe the signers are the mandated actors. Maybe there are five of them on it, and you need three out of five. The only power that the multi-sig would have is that they\u2019re allowed to effectively freeze the oracle. That might be a good extra layer of protection. I haven\u2019t discussed it much with the other mandated actors. I\u2019m not sure if they want that kind of responsibility or liability. LongForWisdom: I think that\u2019s a discussion that we\u2019ll have to have another day as we\u2019re running a little low on time. Nik, do you want to do a more general oracle update? There\u2019s been some good news recently.   Nik: For those of you who saw the forum post, this may not be that new, but we have gotten the results back from ABDK for the LP oracle. They have some feedback on things that they wanted us to change. However, there were no critical or high-priority items that show that the oracle price could be manipulated or is dangerous to use our oracle in the current configuration we have. we do plan to make those changes. We do plan to redeploy the oracles. We will work on the blocker in terms of the LP oracle\u2019s security. That blocker has been relieved, so we can look to increase some of the LP tokens\u2019 debt ceilings. I put the signal request together after the mandated actors discussed it on the weekly call. We recommended that we adjust the USDC-ETH, DAI-ETH, and USDC-DAI vault types. We made the recommendation of 50 million for USDC-ETH, 30 million for DAI-ETH, and 50 million for DAI-USDC. So far, it looks like the community agrees with that assessment.  LongForWisdom: It\u2019s been encouraging to see that response there. We\u2019ll end that poll on a Friday.     Amy Jung  Incentives and Vesting 1:10:10  763\u00d7416 151 KB   This will all be in a post a little bit later.   756\u00d7416 70.1 KB   I want to keep up the idea that there are many nuanced discussions. Hence, the way the framework is done. The budget includes the incentives, the salary, and operational costs. That stuff makes conversations difficult to create in one thread, which is why we want to pull some of that out. There are different points to it: I read a lot about salary itself, the incentives, the amount of the incentives, vesting, and the incentives\u2019 structure, the sourcing of MKR and its mechanics, the social contracts around MKR and minting, and then whether this should be a consistent approach across core units rather than a proposal per core unit.   759\u00d7417 79.6 KB   I want to pull in some of the things Derek covered in his YouTube video call, which concern \u201cwhy\u201d the compensation package is being proposed. We discussed different parameters that we talk through, which are cliff or streaming. There are conversations regarding what that vesting may look like and so on.   760\u00d7418 104 KB   There\u2019s this discussion around the social contract of minting and MKR. There\u2019s some discussion around the power to mint, the reason for minting, and minting being conflicting to some of the ideologies that are under discussion. With minting itself, there was some proposal on how we could think about minting and what that amount could be. A little bit about the burner too, if it were to come from there instead of burning MKR. There was an interesting conversation in the call about buybacks as a vector attack by front runners. A little more emphasis on why MKR should be set aside or that minting might be a more effective mechanism. Everyone has unique opinions on it. Juan has a diagram explaining why, which I won\u2019t go through in detail right now.   758\u00d7415 148 KB   I also want to propose some other ways to think about incentives, and not just regarding vesting or MKR in general. There was some discussion around options. We can think about performance-based bonuses and so on. It could be either rewarding specific amounts to core units instead of each core unit proposing something for itself. We\u2019re also thinking about how this could tie into the work we\u2019re doing with source cred.   755\u00d7413 80.9 KB   Other questions came up as well; one is whether we should scale and standardize this for other teams? Part of it could be to reduce potential future competition. Can there be a wider framework because there are specific approaches that different core units want to have? There are aspects around what happens if a contributor jumps between core units, and what does that package look like for vesting? What are the plans for the foundation MKR and could this be used for that? If we\u2019re thinking about performance, then what it looks like, and how feasible it will be? That was a super brief overview. I was planning for a discussion, but we can save it for last week. LongForWisdom: There may be a separate call to specifically talk about this topic soon.   757\u00d7415 75.7 KB   Common Abbreviated Terms DC: Debt Ceiling ES: Emergency Shutdown SF: Stability Fee DSR: Dai Savings Rate MIP: Maker Improvement Proposal OSM: Oracle Security Module LR: Liquidation Ratio RFC: Request For Comment  Credits  Artem Gordon produced this summary.

My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the Governance Facilitator at MakerDAO. If you want to ask questions or have comments, please do speak up. Everyone here enjoys answering questions.   Weekly Updates  Governance  LongForWisdom 1:40  We had an executive on Friday, which had yet passed. Please, vote. It will bring SF changes. There are no major changes to the Uniswap LP Oracle\u2019s new versions. Still, there are minor edits based on the audit results.   Polls  We had three polls regarding Uniswap liquidity pool tokens and moved those to the Liq 2.0 framework. The Risk Team proposed parameters for the Liq 2.0 framework for those Vaults passed and will be in this Friday\u2019s executive. We had our Monthly MIPs\u2019 Governance Poll for May, which also passed. This will be confirmed on Monday in an executive. If that passes, this will hopefully be the final executive we do on a Monday because we changed the Governance cycle.   GovAlpha Core Unit update 3:03  We have been working on building and setting up a more focused documentation platform for Governance. It\u2019s still in the early stages. We are lifting documentation that we published elsewhere and organizing it to be more coherent. We have been working on the MIPs portal and MIPs in general. Coordinating feedback with DSpot to improve the portal. We are also adding tags to the MIPs to support the new portal. You can now see a menu there, and we are going to add more stuff to it. So it will continue to improve. I have been coordinating SourceCred around future technical work to make the SourceCred distribution process more trustless and automatic. We are looking into setting it up to not have manual distributions to ensure that the credit distribution is canonical if someone tries to do something rogue. We have been figuring out how to improve the forum. Elihu has been working on this. I have made minor changes to the top-level categories earlier today. We are going to continue setting up the categories in a way that makes more sense for users. Lastly, I have been working on figuring out how to onboard contributors into GovAlpha more efficiently. I want to figure out a good starter task that we can get people to do, things we want people to build up into, and generally get more organized on that front.   Forum at a Glance  Payton Rose 5:39 Forum at a Glance - Forum Thread  Three-Point Summary  Call it a stress test?

New vault-type for YFI with a higher LR.  New! @ultraschuppi signals the community on a Growth partnership with Yearn that would allow for an \"ETH-C-like vault for YFI, with a higher Liquidation Ratio but lower Stability Fee.     Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 10:25  We did a security review and discussion of both the delegated voting contract and the flash mint module. We had an L2 strategy meeting to discuss things such as expanding Maker to L2 networks. We also had a session regarding the keg, which helped us decide to move to a design that\u2019s closer to the DssVest. So we will table the keg for a little bit because it has other useful functionalities that we could implement when needed. But it\u2019s more complicated because we need it for sending funds to teams.  Last week\u2019s executives are still out there and need more votes. This is a critical prerequisite for continuing the LP tokens to Liq 2.0, which everyone highly agrees is quite desirable. Liq 2.0 requires that it checks the OSM. We\u2019ll do the LP tokens this week and then finish up with stable coins next week. There is not much to do with stable coins besides cleaning up the technical debt and getting rid of Liq 1.2. Later in the call, we can discuss stable coins and the PSM, based on what Governance wants to do with the PSM for the rest of the stable coins. Finally, we can discuss how we would liquidate those stable coins into respective PSMs. If we\u2019re not going to move something to a PSM, how do we deal with liquidating it? Liquidations 2.0 was a huge success. Everyone who was involved did a great job of helping us accomplish this. We\u2019re also working on converting the clipper calls for Liq 2.0 over to the LP tokens and the auction demo keeper. It will be capable of liquidating LP tokens when it\u2019s ready. Some MegaPoker or OmegaPoker work, but I am not sure what the exact details are.  Steven: Can you elaborate more on the thinking and timeframe behind the delegation. Chris: We\u2019re beelining it to the lightest touch or simplest implementation that we can. The irony is that most of the code was written back during Osaka; it\u2019s been sitting around since Devcon. Sam updated it for modern times. We have one general concern with that implementation which is that it doesn\u2019t expire delegate. There is concern that if you delegate MKR to somebody. That delegate passes away or something, then that person will have control of MKR up to infinity. We\u2019re going to introduce expirations of 12 to 18 months because we do expect to have DssVest replacing the DssChief at some point. We have stuff for early-mid June, but I would bet that delegation could be ready by mid-late June. Derek: The other dependency is the front-end work. Yesterday, we discussed with the JS team a bit of work involving dependency on completing the Liq 2.0. Mid-end June is a safe assumption, but their team has to size it. The code is mostly done, and we would like to perform an internal audit and some testing. Chris: The good news from this approach is that it\u2019s the modified version of the voting proxy, which means custodians can easily integrate with it. Wouter: Are the delegates able and supposed to use vote proxy themselves? Chris: The person who\u2019s voting will be using the vote proxy interface to cast their votes Kurt: Let me clarify a little bit. First of all, what\u2019s the motivating question because there\u2019s a separation between UI and the underlying contracts. There\u2019s a delegation contract where people can delegate to it. The delegate is basically the owner or authority on that contract, and they interact directly with that contract to vote. There is no vote proxy per se, but it\u2019s like the delegation contract itself is the voting proxy in some sense. So they could separately have their own MKR in the voting proxy. I am not sure whether this is a concern or a reasonable model? Wouter: This is reasonable, but the practical concern is whether we need to support the voting proxy. At some point, we can completely replace it with the delegation system. My reason to keep the voting proxy is to secure the actual voting itself if you control a large MKR amount that you are voting with. However, the voting proxy can be deprecated after some time once the delegation system is in place. Kurt: The utility of the voting proxy is that you have a separation between an address that can move the MKR and then another address that can only vote, and that\u2019s the value of the voting proxy, right? Is it the separation of those two things? Wouter: Yes, and the same separation is there right with the delegate contract. Kurt: You have a very analogous thing where you can make your hot wallet or whatever as the owner of the delegation contract so that it can only vote. Then you delegate to yourself or the delegation contract from a cold wallet. Therefore, the address that is responsible for voting on proposals has no power to move the MKR.     Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 23:12  The executive to put in the replacement Oracle LP contracts still hasn\u2019t been executed. We\u2019re currently using the older Oracle LP token contracts. Hopefully, we can get those soon because there are few edits that the audit caught, which are considerably gas efficient. Kurt and the Smart Contracts team did well in optimizing that. Concerning events involving oracles, we did considerably better than Black Thursday. The lessons learned a year back helped us a lot in implementation. We do have oracle alarms going off left and right, but this is expected due to the extreme volatility. We need to be cautious of costs. Many discussions in the #general channel concerning costs that the DAO is taking on. Oracle costs are a significant portion of them. For example, yesterday, the max gas price was 3500 Gwei compared to the normal day 100 Gwei, which means we\u2019re spending 35 times the amount through Oracle costs in a single day. These costs are now handled by the foundation but are expected to be taken over by Protocol. Here are a couple of things we should consider:  How do you determine what the cost should be from an oracle coordinate perspective? How much Gwei is too much to ask from the DAO? What cadence do you want to ask for this money from the DAO?   We can ask this every month, but what happens if one of those executives were to not pass in time, right? We can end up sitting there thinking, \u2018oh, shoot!\u2019 If you start asking for a budget every three months and see a big spike in gas prices, this estimation would not work anymore. We\u2019ve discussed this for the core units in the #general channel. We have an emergency multi-sig that we can dip into, part of the Protocol Engineering Core Unit proposal. It was also part of the Oracle Core Unit proposal where there is a reserve multi-state for times of protocol distress that we can dip into. We need a fund for oracle gas costs if we encounter crazy days like yesterday where we spend a month\u2019s worth of oracle gas in a single day. I\u2019m going to be working on coming up with a way to conservatively model how much we need to spend. Part of that will include determining a collateral type and the expected costs or at least the expected annual range of costs to have a collateral type in the Maker protocol. This will give us a perspective of when we want to onboard something and how much revenue and stability a new collateral type will bring. If it\u2019s less than the expected oracle costs, then it\u2019s probably a no-go. This includes some of the existing collateral types. These ideas have been brought up before where we have a bunch of tokens that spend more on oracle costs on an annual basis than they make in stability fees. There was a discussion yesterday involving ZRX, which has vaults that ended up being profitable for the protocol. Unfortunately, we also made a bunch of liquidation penalties. We should not account for revenue from liquidation penalties when considering if an onboard token is profitable. In addition, KNC, BAL, COMP are all unprofitable. Some of the LP tokens we added, such as DAI-USDT, haven\u2019t had a single DAI minted against it, so that is definitely unprofitable. AAVE-ETH and LINK-ETH are unprofitable as well. It\u2019s one of these things where we want to liberally onboard new collateral types. The demands for vaults have been all over the place. It\u2019s difficult to predict what will happen. We do have tokens like YFI, which are runaway successes, and we have much higher market cap tokens such as COMP that have not been working. We can onboard liberally and test out the demand, but we can also off-board liberally as soon we realize that the demand is not there. There\u2019s no point in continuing to take on the oracle costs if the demand is not being expressed. Oracle costs are just one of several costs associated with it; there are other costs with maintaining collateral, but I would argue that the oracle costs are the majority of the continuous costs of supporting a collateral type. I\u2019ll be updating this discussion in the forum, emphasizing oracle gas and how we can structure that from a DAO perspective.   Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 32:19  Last week, we proposed the Liq 2.0 parameters for Uni LPs. The remaining ones now are stablecoin vaults which also need new liquidation parameters implemented. There are a few ways on how to liquidate stablecoins. We\u2019ll discuss this later in the call. Still, generally speaking, we have generic auction price curves and other parameters ready that can be used for all stablecoins even if you liquidate them into PSM, which was one of the ideas. We may discuss this today. Some of them are still over collateralized and are in the old state. We need to have this Liq 2.0 support nonetheless.  Sushi LP evaluations were done today @rema proposing similar parameters as for Uni LPs apart from stability fee, which is proposed to be higher due to yields on Sushi LPs leverage farming. We released a new Risk dashboard for our site. You can read more about the roadmap on the forum. I saw many people use this dashboard yesterday when we had a lot of liquidation. I imagine the liquidations for the next OSM update were very popular. However, the site is still in beta. There might be a few errors, or some data may be updated late; don\u2019t get scared when looking at those numbers right now. We had liquidations yesterday\u2014I published a presentation on the forums. Everything went well, and our metrics are great, but we\u2019ll cover this later on. We also noticed that we need to reconfigure some of the parameters. Yesterday, we unwinded a $5000 DAI depth vault through high gas costs, which may have been unprofitable. We need to re-evaluate our dust limits concerning keepers kicking them and bidding for them. Lastly, we discussed introducing a flat fee for kicking auctions, which is the tip parameter. This is different than the chip parameter, which is a variable incentive. The variable fee doesn\u2019t offset the gas costs for kicking smaller vaults, and we knew about this. But there were always some edge case attack vectors. If the tip is too high, these flat fee keepers could be farming these kick incentives or reset incentives. We\u2019ll re-evaluate this and propose a flat fee somewhere in the value of $300. it should be lower than the penalty fee on the dust size, which is $650.   Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 36:31  Good news! We now have more than 1 Million DAI coming from RWAs, and 1.3 Million DAI from NewSilver. In addition, these RWAs will be locked for 12 months, so there should be no issues even during market volatility. We\u2019re trying to publish an executive on June 11th with all the Centrifuge collaterals that you will want to onboard. The poll will go live either next week or the week after. All the risk assessments are already out except for People\u2019s Company, which should be done by tomorrow. Concerning the Trust Model, we were finishing the first review of the successor legal documents that Mathew shared in the forum last week. We\u2019re also working to see how we could incorporate a Maker representative of our company in the Cayman Islands. It\u2019s similar to \u2018Match Your ID.\u2019 The collateral agents of the trusts are willing to do anything for money but don\u2019t want to make any decision. We need someone to tell them what they need to do or trigger the launch of the script they need to follow. We need someone to give them a kick. There is also the first RWA committee this week. This will help our progression a lot.   Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 39:14 Forum Thread: Growth CU Weekly-Update May 14-20  Thanks to Seth, we\u2019re going to begin following DAI on other networks and see what\u2019s happening outside the Ethereum network and Polygon. There is huge demand and lots of projects that are using DAI in Polygon. We\u2019re also having these initial conversations with new DeFi projects in Polygon that are going to launch. These include using DAI with various payment gateways and wallets. We\u2019ve also started conversations with YFI in building use cases about having custom-made vaults or industrial vaults for our largest vault users. It\u2019s important to understand how users are using the protocol and help them. Please read the @ultraschuppi\u2019s post about the YFI team looking to open even bigger vaults, and post your comments because we want to do this with other vault users like Nexo and Celsius. They are the biggest users of our protocol. Lastly, we have the exchanges from different part of the globe which listed the MKR token. We didn\u2019t know how to communicate with the community regarding how can they purchase MKR using their local currency. Please give us your ideas.  LongForWisdom: I think it would be great to create a forum post on the advantages and disadvantages related to the MKR token. The community can post their ideas and opinions there. Nadia: Ok, I will do it by today or tomorrow.

The contents will continue to the executive vote on Monday.   Liquidation 2.0 Performance  Primoz Kordez 56:13  Yesterday, we had the biggest liquidation event at Maker, like many other places in DeFi. For Ether, it was the second-biggest drop. The largest drawdown today was 46%, and Black Thursday last year was 48%. So it was a good stress test for Liq 2.0.   Debt1433\u00d7806 64.8 KB   This is the cumulative debt being liquidated, including penalty fees, on one day, May 19th. It misses two other heat liquidations we had overnight. Roughly 50 million of debt was liquidated in one day if you include those. WBTC was liquidated initially, then ETH-A, and then some other Vaults like ZRX and ETH-B. Altogether, 50 million in one day.   General Stats1431\u00d7704 106 KB   Here are some performance stats more or less focused on penalty fees. I forgot to mention there were 177 auctions and that a 5,109,538 penalty fee was collected. Almost all penalty fee was collected successfully, apart from a few Vaults were it wasn\u2019t. Three Vaults on ETH-A were unluckily liquidated at the worst point of time, considering the price curve. ETH-B has a lower collateralization ratio, so any discounts from auctions, from keepers\u2019 profits, or just slippage related leads to penalty fees not being fully collected. And ZRX-A was a special case because it was liquidated in few batches. After all, we limited auction throughput because the launching liquidity is not that good. But all in all, 12,44% is the full number, so nothing to complain about.   Same Chart1429\u00d7799 70 KB   Loss Events1431\u00d7793 57 KB   I wanted to include the Loss Events to be fully transparent. This is a really small number of Vaults that got liquidated. When keepers liquidate a small Vault, it costs a lot in gas fees related to the debt being bought, so they bid lower prices. On ETH-A, you can see that the slippage towards OSM was 28%, but the loss was 81DAI. For ETH-B, it is not as small. Again, because of ETH-B, any slippage related to keepers\u2019 profits and bad price trajectory versus the price curve leads to a loss. We had a 12 thousand DAI loss. The total loss for Maker was 12 thousand versus 5,1 million of revenues.   Returned Collateral to Vaults1433\u00d7799 85.6 KB   This is another metric that is also relevant. There are three parts to the whole thing. How much penalty fees Maker collects, the profits of keepers, and how much Vault gets back. This is especially important, and this metric might be confusing. It checks how much collateral a Vault owner got back versus his total deposited collateral. If the liquidation ratio is high, you normally get more back. For something like 175 liquidation ratio Vault, they should get back on some normal prices by about 30% to 35% for the remaining collateral. This is what we are mostly seeing. Whereas at some lower collateralized Vaults such as ETH-A or even ETH-B, those shares are smaller because the liquidation ratio is smaller and the penalty fee is higher related to the whole collateral. For ETH-B, the normal number is about 15%; it should be closer to 20% for ETH-A. This could be better, but it wasn\u2019t mostly because of those two Vaults unluckily liquidated at the worst possible time.   Auction Efficiency1425\u00d7804 76.6 KB   This chart shows how you measure Auction Efficiency. Normally, it is related to the OSM price. We know OSM price is left by one hour. If keepers are a bit late, if they want more profit, you have these delays in bids if the price trajectory is worse than the auction price curve. The expected bid is about 40 minutes, but if the price keeps tanking faster than the auction price or if keepers want to make more profit, we have delays in bids. When this happens, the price is lower than the OSM. For instance, the average discount on all the ETH-A auctions was about 6% to 7%. If we wanted to have 100% efficient auctions, it would be somewhere around the 0,00% line or slightly higher depending on how the price trajectory goes. Normally, you want to have 100% efficiency, zero slippage in OSM, but why does this happen? One reason is just the auction price curve versus the market price trajectory. It is not perfect, and you cannot just determine it because you do not know how the prices will move. The other reason is related to keepers. Here, efficiency looks at settlement prices at auction versus the market prices. We wanted to check the market price at the time of the settlement, whereas we looked at the off-chain real-time prices. This is not necessarily 100% correct because many keepers just flip collateral on on-chain venues. It is not necessarily one-to-one synced with the auction prices. This is just an estimate, but it is about there. It shows that keepers who were bidding, for instance, on ETH-A, were actually bidding on average 6% or 7% below market prices. This was an estimated profit that is not 100% correct, but they need to take something for themselves. What does this basically tell us? This slippage that you see versus OSM is not necessarily related, just too bad pricing or bad price trajectory versus auction curve. Still, keepers are not 100% competitive. They are not working with zero profits, so we see part of the Vault performance because of this\u2014still, good numbers in general. What may be worth adding here is that some smaller Vaults have higher slippage because gas costs are high. After all, keepers will bid lower because the liquidity tokens of other Vaults are not as good. When keepers offload, they need to assign the slippage, which they can already see on Uniswap, for instance, so they bid lower. That is why we have throughput limitations, as we did yesterday for ZRX.   Auction Efficiency1429\u00d7798 90.9 KB   Same thing but focused on ETH Vaults. Here you see the two Vaults that were liquidated at the worst possible time. Yesterday we had luck, and suddenly we had not. The price was updated right before the drop, which means that the auction price started at a higher price, which is around 2440. Then, the price kept tanking, about 20% in 20 or 30 minutes. The auction price curve could not catch the market price, which was dropping, and that is why these two Vaults were liquidated at much lower prices, about a 25% discount to OSM. These are the Vaults that did not carry the penalty fee, and this is why we had a bit worse performance on ETH-A. Otherwise, all the other Vaults were healthy. Everything up to 10% discount is good. Again, it is a random process.   Settlement Time Distribution1427\u00d7804 67.7 KB   This is the distribution of settlement times. The expected auction duration is about 40 minutes if keepers do take nothing for themselves, if prices are stable, and so on. On average, in all the Vaults types, we were between 30 and 50, so it worked as it should. But because of this random volatility, some Vaults got liquidated later. Here, you can see these two ETH Vaults again with 80 to 200 minutes. As soon as it goes above 100 minutes, it becomes for ETH-A. It\u2019s important to mention that they would already carry a loss if those two Vaults were ETH-B.   Keeper Participation - KICKS1432\u00d7809 107 KB   This is Keeper Participation for KICKS events when they trigger an auction. Surprisingly 18 keepers were kicking auctions, especially knowing that retail did not kick any auctions. It is also good to notice that these are not necessarily 18 different entities because they may have many wallets. However, 18 different entities while it is kicking is always good. There is also the amount that they received as an incentive. The variable incentive is a very cheap parameter, and it was set at 0.1% of Vault. They get the incentive parameter back when they kick a Vault. This is the part that we need to re-evaluate because some smaller Vaults were not necessarily kicked immediately. This is why we need to introduce this flat fee that I was talking about earlier. There are mostly three keepers that kicked most of the auctions.   Keeper Participation - TAKES1436\u00d7811 104 KB   These are the entities that purchased collateral. There are 21 of them, and retail is included here as well. The amounts are great. Compared to Liq 1.2, where we had one to three people bidding, this is 10 or 20 times better. It looks good. There are again three performing entities, but that is probably Vaults\u2019 related, so we want to see that as well.   Conclusions  The main conclusions are that we need to introduce the flat fee. There were some discussions to see if we should make the auction duration shorter. There are trade-offs to this. I have made a whole post on the forum about it. Definitely, for the two problematic Vaults, it looks that the duration should be shorter, and everything should be fine. However, it is tough to say if this would be the case because if you make the auction duration shorter, it means the auction price curve is more aggressive, is steeper. This means that if you have some delays, even of Vaults, you could get in a similar scenario with a 10% to 20% discount to OSM. This is possible because if you make a shorter auction, delays are more probable. You can have a more congested network, etc. For ETH-B, we should make it more aggressive because it is riskier to lead the losses. After all, any discount from 10% to 20% can lead to losses to Maker really soon.   Questions  David Utrobin: (About the slide \u201cKeeper Participation (KICKS)\u201d) Your guess is that of 18 unique keepers, some of them might be run by the same groups?  Primoz Kordez: Yes, it is possible. Someone could make an auction analysis and confirm this. Christopher Mooney: Is it possible that these could be from the Web3 UIs as well? Primoz Kordez: I have been thinking about it, and it could be. Nik: I don\u2019t know if anybody kicked through the UI, but I know of at least one person who bid through the UI and said the experience was great and profitable. We are still in a regime where it is not all Vaults winning these, which I think is interesting. Primoz Kordez: Yes, it is good no to rely on Vaults solely, because if it is one or two of them and then you have this tragedy when Vaults will take all the volume, and then they stop bidding, but one Vault goes offline, then you have an issue. It is good to see this kind of bidding.   Frank Cruz: Thank you for that presentation. What is your thinking behind raising the dust parameter? Doubling it, tripling it?  Primoz Kordez: It is hard to say. Monet-supply made a table where you input gas cost parameters, and you simulate how much it costs. He focused more on Liq, but this was back on 1.2. Here we need to make a different simulation because it works differently now. I believe it is less gas-intensive, but this is only one part of the story. The other part is related to the user perspective. They want to unwind, but if it costs 2000 dollars to unwind and his debt size is 5000, he will not do it. We need to make those calculations, and I cannot tell you a number right now.   Kurt Barry: I think the Liq system performed really well yesterday despite a bad market event. This is the worst that we have seen since Black Thursday by far. But I also want to not celebrate too much because this is the warm-up for whatever happens at the end of the current Vault run. Today everything is green and going back up. Still, there will be another one of these in the future and probably worse, so this is a dress rehearsal. We need to ensure that we iron out any issues around profitability, dust levels, keeper incentivization, etc. This was a great data point, but we should not get complacent here. We should take it forward and figure out how to make this bulletproof.  Christopher Mooney: I will second that. There was a moment when we were staring down the barrel of a one billion dollar Liq wave. That made me feel despair. Overall our box is set at like 100 million right now, but we need to think about what the system can push through it carefully. Obviously, the DAI supply dropped by half a billion or 400 million or so. That is, in a way, soft Liq, but it is worth thinking if this is a dress rehearsal for a bigger event, what can we actually do. LongForWisdom: These are great points. I am sure that you guys and Primoz will continue to worry about it for the foreseeable future. When you are ready to present proposals, everyone will be happy to see them.     Open Discussion 01:18:00  PSMs  Christopher Mooney: We have to figure out what we are going to do with stablecoins. The mandated actors were starting to discuss what we might want to do with stablecoins going forward. It feels like most of the decisions turn around whether or not Governance and the Community sees the need for a PSM for various types of stablecoins. There is one possibility for low liquidity where stablecoins could be put in a PSM with a zero DC, so you cannot add any more stablecoin types, but you can provide DAI and get the stablecoin out. In theory, it would be one-way. You cannot throw the stablecoin back in and then get DAI out of it. Maybe we will do that with TUSD. Maybe we do that with PAX. We wanted to open to see what people were thinking. Maybe create a signal thread about exactly what Governance wants to move into a PSM style format. Once we know that, we can set up a custom liquidator that would liquidate Vaults that are undercollateralized into that PSM-style setup on genuine collateral types of stablecoins we have left. We can think more critically about how we want to handle those and Liq for those.  LongForWisdom: It feels like the issue is to figure out which stablecoins we want PSMs for. Christopher Mooney: That is the first branching decision, and that is what I was hoping everybody would think about. Primoz Kordez: I am going to add here that there are six stablecoins. USDC-A is going to be liquidated for PSM, which exists for USDC. We have USDC-B, which is totally unutilized, DC is to zero. Doing anything to it will cost on-chain more. The same goes with TUSD: the DC is set to zero. It feels like with USDC-B and TUSD is not reasonable to spend any time. Then we have PAX USD, which is unwinding now because we introduced 1% SF. This token is pretty liquid lately. Last time we checked, if you sell 5 million of it, there is already 20% to 30% slippage on-chain. I am not sure about PSM here, but the solution where you only allow a certain amount of DC makes sense to me, so I propose this. It goes similarly to TUSD. The launch liquidity is better, but this Governance voted to limit DC to zero because of debt acquisition. We can do the same with PAX USD. We can introduce these two PSMs limited. The only one left is TUSD. It is probably one of the most prospective ones currently looking from the on-chain activity and different farming types of activity. It is not under collateralized, so we cannot put it into PSM. The question is just to introduce PSM for this one as well. There are other stablecoins like Binance USD\u2026 Nik Kunkel: Yes, but Binance USD is just a white-labeled PAX USD. Primoz Kordez: It has better traction in DeFi farming, though. Nik Kunkel: On BSC or on Ethereum? Primoz Kordez: I think on Ethereum, but I might be wrong. Nik Kunkel: I could be wrong as well, but I feel like I am very active in the farming community, and I have barely seen BUSD used anywhere. Primoz Kordez: It is a curve, and the slippage curves checked are much better. It is pretty big, at least compared to PAX USD. Matthew Robinowitz: Can I just step back for a second and understand our overarching strategy and reasoning behind the PSM with other stablecoins? Is it to diversify away from how much we are using USDC? Is that correct? Christopher Mooney: If we are going to have an active one, that would definitely be the case. It would be to limit collateral risk. There is a sort of benefit because this is a much cleaner type of liquidation. If we need to liquidate these, we don\u2019t take any pricing risk or slippage risk. We also have a sin que problem. If we were to try and liquidate TUSD as Vaults, all of that would go out to Liq 2.0. It would have some undefined price curve that hopefully would fetch a price but would probably have some slippage. We probably do not have enough liquidity to trade against it, and we would probably take a loss, and it would go to MKR holders. The alternative is, you throw it into a PSM with a zero DC, and people can just come along and grab it whenever they need liquidity, and eventually, it tends to zero. It is beyond diversifying collateral risk. The PSM is a liquidation mechanism in a way. LongForWisdom: I am interested in knowing if anybody from the Community has strong opinions about any of the stablecoin options beyond USDC. Does anybody think we should definitely have PSMs, or anybody that think we should definitely not have PSMs? These are the things we are trying to figure out. We did have a vote previously about moving various stablecoins to PSMs. But that is a little old now, and the environment has changed in several ways. So if anybody wants to organize further signals, as Chris said, or just wants to open the discussion, that would be helpful for the Protocol Engineering Team and the rest of us. Payton Rose: Especially if we allow both ways on some of the income sources not tied to the market fluctuations, I like that. It adds stability to the DeFi ecosystem. DAI is truly at a dollar if you can redeem it for all these other dollar coins at any time. So just in general, I would support it as much as Risk thinks we could take on. It would seem like a reasonable course of action from my perspective. Aaron (chat): We would love GUSD PSM. LongForWisdom: I think that is reasonable. GUSD is maybe one of the contenders. Primoz, you were saying that GUSD has not great liquidity, right? Primoz Kordez: It is not great compared to USDC, but it is better than PAX. It is also questionable how much we can diversify to other stablecoins because all the arbitrage is still likely to happen with USDC. We should force it, but then we need to limit PSM on USDC to push others in. I am not sure. LongForWisdom: If we actually wanted to diversify, we would need some mechanism that manages the DCs of them better. You cannot have one that takes up all of the room. I do not know how that would work. Primoz Kordez: It is also risky because you still want to have a high buffer available for USDC. If there is a worst-case event, a huge DAI shock\u2026 Matthew Robinowitz: It is a DAI shock in the upward price direction, but if for whatever reason it happens to be a flood of DAI into the market that subsequently pushes it below one, all of the stablecoins are going to go to zero, all of our exposure would go to zero. Primoz Kordez: That will not happen anytime soon. I made a post on the forum about this. There are 800 million DAI on the curve first, and then PSM starts draining. So there is 1.5 billion, which is now probably lower but 1/3 or 20% of DAI supply. So I do not believe that could happen soon. David Utrobin: I think the comment that Nik made in the chat is important. That we take on the failure of any of the stablecoins, we decide to support with the PSM. Unlike Vaults with a stability fee with a risk premium priced in, PSMs have the toll fee in and out, but I do not know if that is considered from a risk perspective. If we hold on to 800-900 USDC, it is relatively safe, but maybe we are ok with doing BUSD for 50 million or 25 million. Is it really just the toll fees that are a buffer against that kind of risk? My question is, where is the risk hedging for taking on more PSMs and more stablecoins? Nik Kunkel: To expand on the context of that, putting something in a PSM is very different from just onboarding it as an asset. When you onboard a collateral type, i.e., the KNC token, if the price of KNC drops, we liquidate, and that is how we get our money back. With PSM, we own those tokens, and we have complete exposure to them. The only way to limit the additional exposure we take on is with a DC for that PSM, but we take it as a loss if it goes to zero. If the thing fails, we should expect the entire DC to allocate to this thing just to be filled up by arbitraging people. The risk of loss for any stablecoin failing is the DC that we set for the PSM, and the little in and out fees are not going to matter for ensuring that loss. S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: I think one of the risks is the fact that currently, our main competitor is USDC, and I am quite sure they do not care about us because we are too small, but if they start caring about us and we have 1 million USDC in a Vault, they might start to lobby to try to blacklist this PSM. That is the issue of having only one option. If we have many options, we can quit the current party risk of USDC. I understand that currently, USDC is the best option but having other options in the future if there is a need could be interesting. David Utrobin: In general, given everything that everybody said, I would favor two or three PSMs for the most popular, less risky stablecoins. Nik Kunkel: The problem is nothing will see as much use as USDC. You can have three PSMs, but how much are you really diversifying when you have a billion USDC and 25 million GUSD. S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: It will not, but we have the facility and ability to transfer USDC to GUSD. It will not be easy, but at least we will be able to. Nik Kunkel: I wonder if there is some kind of pre-configured way we can authorize to liquidate the entire USDC PSM if we needed to do it in a hurry. Some way where you can have a pre-signed transaction and then you just put it in a Bot which is checking them in a pool, and you try to front-run any blacklisting. Whoever is running that Bot is dangerous. Because you could potentially liquidate the PSM anyway, even if there were not a blacklist transaction, I am not sure if that is even viable. Christopher Mooney: You would see the transaction instantly flash mint the equivalent of DAI, create an LP token and drop it in an LP pool. It is no longer in the PSM; you probably will earn fees from the LP\u2026 Nik Kunkel: Even that or just trading it into DAI or something like Curve or Uniswap V3 or whatever. You will take on some loss but compared to the blacklisting risk; you avoid its ruin. David Utrobin: I am curious about the design decision from Protocol Engineering about potentially adding blacklists to things like PSM preemptively so that if there is an ETH address that a government agency blacklists, we could do the proactive thing and go along with that. But I know there is a lot of ideology that might shape people\u2019s views on this. So I would be super curious to hear the conversation. Nik Kunkel: Once you have given yourself the ability to, then all of a sudden, you have the obligation. We should be cautious about implementing any censorship on top of our permissionless platform because we may find ourselves in a position where we are obligated to comply. David Utrobin: That is a very good insight. LongForWisdom: On that cheerfulness, let us wrap the call. Thank you all for coming!

My name is LongForWisdom. I am the Governance Facilitator at MakerDAO. We like people to get involved and ask questions or comments, so please, do not be shy if you have something to say.   Weekly Updates  Governance  LongForWisdom 01:13  Polls:  Four greenlight polls are active, which are MC-DROP, HPT, MATIC, and GNO. Multiple June Ratification Polls for the monthly Governance cycle; voting ends soon! Two weekly polls have passed, enabling the DC-IAM for PSM-USDC-A, and investigating to offboard multiple Vault types.   Please vote for the currently ongoing Executive Poll. We may consider skipping this week\u2019s Executive because there is only one piece of content that can be bundled into something else next week.   GovAlpha Core Unit update 03:40 GovAlpha Weekly Update  We are working on our Quarterly Review, which is halfway complete. LongForWisdom and Payton Rose had initial meetings with several GovAlpha applicants. Meetings have tended to go well, and we\u2019re getting new people working on some starter tasks. The launch timeline for delegation is becoming firm; we do not have an exact date but will share details soon. If you are interested in being a delegate for MakerDAO or GovAlpha, please get in touch.   Forum at a Glance  Payton Rose 05:22  It\u2019s been an active week with some interesting discussions happening on the forum.  Forum at a Glance for June 18th - 24th  Three-Point Summary  Revenue down, but morale is up. The recent rates change is targeting more DAI creation outside of stablecoin facilities. Over 6M DAI worth of Collateral was successfully liquidated last week without any loss events for Maker. While still in an impressive range, the slippage for trading DAI has increased the last couple of weeks, with slippage trades below 30,000 DAI at or above 0.1%.   Discussions   A Framework for Real-World Assets.   @juan points to the need for a framework when evaluating and onboarding Real-World Assets to the Maker Protocol.    Some thoughts on Liquity.   @LongForWisdom takes a deep dive into the Liquidity Protocol to evaluate the potential of LUSD in a PSM facility.    Maker will thrive in the bear market\u2026 If we can keep calm and carry on.   @Replenish2030 shares some reflections on Governance stability through turbulent market conditions.     Signal Requests   Adjusting ttl(bid-duration) on flap-auctions - Signal Extended  Make sure to cast your vote in @ultraschuppi\u2019s signal to decrease the auction time on surplus auctions. The signal has been extended until July 8th.    Raise SF On RWA When Issuers Unilaterally Change Terms   @PaperImperium throws up his first signal, asking the community if they would like to implement an automatic rates hike when DROP agreements are changed without input from Maker.    Shorten the PPG process   @alexis signals the community on shortening Parameter Proposal Groups (PPGs) to have their recommendations voted on by the community.     Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 08:13  We had some carryover work from last week that includes SushiJoin adapter and CropJoin, gas optimizations, improve manager contract implementation, and the D3M is in the final round of clean up. In vote delegation, we added 1-year expiry to the vote delegation process. in the contract optimization, a gas bug will cause the worst-case to consume max block gas. If you want to fall back to a version before the LP tokens, we will fix that and will be pushed shortly. In the reviews and documentation, Kurt put together a really good document defining magnitudes and ranges for all Dss parameters and quantities. We did some risk scenario analysis around oracle tail risk outside of the oracle domain. Once we ingest oracle prices, there are some for defense in depth; there are additional safeguards that we can provide. The info is not yet public, but we will post it once we make it more formal. Also, we\u2019re doing DSR entity-relationship and system modeling with BlockScience, and we are also reviewing the Optimism DAI Bridge. The PE team is looking for pivoting off most of the projects we\u2019re looking at by focusing on collateral onboarding, this doesn\u2019t mean we will be abandoning L2, but we\u2019re thinking about ways within the short term to try and get the Dai supply up. We\u2019re thinking and prioritizing with other mandated actors and Governance by looking at this concept of institutional Vaults and even permissionless versions of that, such as conditional Vaults based on the parameters decided. We\u2019re looking at stETH and doing technical analysis of this and SushiJoin and CropJoin stuff, to which we will add additional supply and LP tokens. Sam is reviewing gUNI, which is Gelato aggregated LP token for Uniswap V3. Instead of working on DssGov or one of the other MIPs with higher priority, we\u2019re thinking in the short term, we need to focus on non-USDC styles of collaterals to help balance the collateral risk.  Kris Kaczor: We\u2019ve been working on the L2 risk framework docs describing different architectures of L2s, such as scaling solutions and outlining the risks for Maker. For example, what would be the worst-case scenario if we decide to deploy Dss on such a solution? Eventually, Governance can make an educated decision on this. We\u2019re working closely with the Optimism Standard Bridge, but today we found a rough edge that we need to fix. We\u2019re also working on the UI integration side and testing things like cross-chain spells. Finally, there is some work related to Arbitrum, which is now finalizing their Standard Dai Bridge; we will help work with them.   Christopher Mooney: We have two new team members; First is Julien Martin.  Julien Martin: Hello everybody. I\u2019m a developer from France. I have a master\u2019s degree in cryptography with experience in the financial sector. I am excited to be here! Christopher Mooney: Thanks, Julian. The second new team member is Talbaneth. Talbaneth: Hello, everyone. I\u2019m an embedded software engineer and manager. I\u2019ve worked in Kyber Network as an SC Engineer with experience in projects like wBTC, AMN, hybrid EOS contracts, and more. I also worked with liquidations and arbitrage contracts. I am very happy to be here, thanks!   Christopher Mooney: Regarding the legal risks being considered for things like stETH in collateral prioritization framework stuff. Currently, we have a broad set of teams that take a look and do a gut check to get that initial score. I don\u2019t know if the legal risk is added there, but we can add a column.  Frank Cruz: Any TBD for Optimism? This was supposed to happen in July. Kris Kaczor: We might have intermediate deployment as with SNX where anyone would be able to move Dai once it\u2019s public.     Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 20:18  We started doing the production rollout of a tool called gopher that we\u2019ve been working on last year. This will be a big improvement because the prices from exchanges and other sources will be pulled locally and cached to prevent blocking behavior. In the coming weeks, we\u2019re going to roll out a tool called spire which is an alternative network to scuttlebutt; these two networks will be running parallel and add an extra layer of upper density, so if there\u2019s ever an issue with scuttlebutt then price messages can be grabbed from the spire and vice-versa. Concerning the Oracles CU, we\u2019re finding ways to legally structure things and prioritize roles for projects and hiring, stuff that is behind the scenes. We\u2019ve been reviewing the stETH oracle code. We\u2019re going to use their contracts and deploy our instances of those contracts because they are upgradable for the Maker Protocol.  Matthew Rabinowitz: Have you looked at integrating CME real-time index data for ETH price as a potential feed compared to the gopher project? Nick: That\u2019s a good point. One of the first things we want to do is update all of the BTC, ETH, and others data. What we plan to do will fall within the subject that you mention.     Risk Team Update  Rema 25:47  We worked on two collateral evaluations, MATIC and stETH from Lido; the descriptive part is almost done, but we\u2019re still running some simulations and adding relevant data and simulations to the risk dashboard because stETH has the main market on Curve. We need to find a way of collecting that data. These reports will be published soon. We\u2019re working on a direct Dai deposit module risk assessment relevant to our platform. We\u2019re also working on few things which are not visible right now, namely address labeling. As a result, we will have a better picture of Vault users and their applications to open the Vaults and then know whether they are protected by protocols such as DeFi Saver. Last week, we worked on adding centralized exchange trading volume. Previously, we only had one aggregated chart, but now we\u2019ve two more charts aggregated by exchanges and trading pairs.   Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 28:03  I have published the post mortem on the notification issue concerning NewSilver. They also now have an independent director. We will begin the Centrifuge structure next week. They now have audits of the lending side of the teammate contracts. They will make improvements. The landing site was changed a little to be integrated with Maker. Next month, I will ask about an increase in NewSilver DC, which is currently 5,000,000. They are using 70% of their DC. They want to continue a business relationship with us using a higher DC. The next Centrifuge batch includes four assets, which are still delayed until finished adding the independent director. They will also include the new notification system. SolarX may also be delayed due to a large amount of paperwork. Christian worked on solutions on the legal side involving Caymen Islands. The solution will be to use the Cayman Foundation, which is similar to the Maker Growth Foundation. It will take orders from the DAO, making it a legal entity that we can use for many things and direct it from the DAO itself. However, there needs to be some economic substance in the Cayman Islands; maybe having somebody living there and giving them a job to show up to the office. Our quiet presence there will be an expense as well. We now have three law firms working with us. One is in the Cayman Islands, and the other two are international. We made a small improvement on the Dune Analytics dashboard; We now have the revenues per collateral, which shows us that RWAs are 0.1% of the total assets of Maker and generating 0.2% of that revenue. In addition, we began creating on-chain data providing more analytic information so that we can eventually not use Dune Analytics.   Questions  Lucas: How much can we scale this as interest rates are decreasing in crypto collateral? I expect this scale very well.  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: We want to have no tail risk above the surplus buffer, which would reduce our risk as we begin with these new legal structures. This may significantly delay the scaling to achieve two billion. Chris or Brian mentioned that the issue we have is that the USDC-PSM is great for liquidity to redeem Da, but if you use them in RWAs, there may be some lag and delay to redeem that USDC back on-chain. There are questions to be answered before we can move RWAs above one billion.   LongForWisdom: Are there any updates on 6S?  Matthew Rabinowitz: Two administrative items are remaining, along with the transfer instructions with the broker-dealer. We are expecting the red lines within the next 24 hours.   Lucas: Matt, I understand that enforceability opinions need to be done on the final documents. Are those the final documents for a specific deal or the overall setup? What\u2019s the process for getting the first deal complete? Matthew Rabinowitz: The trust structure is mixed with 6S Capital, which doesn\u2019t change because it\u2019s one set of enforceability opinions. Every single transaction that happens downstream from 6S Capital to would-be borrowers each has its own enforceability opinions, which are done during every single deal.  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: What is the timeline for the trust structure or legal opinion? Matthew Rabinowitz: It is when we close.     Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 35:42 Growth CU Weekly Updates  The Risk CU and us had a conversation with Circle following up on the forum discussion regarding us investing our USDC. Circle offers a yield account but requires an entity to sign the agreements and pass through their KYC and compliance processes. We discussed a potential opportunity to lend them one billion USDC; would they offer a different yield due to our high volume. They said they are not worried about the yield because they are also working with Genesis handling enormous volumes of money. Therefore, their yield should be fixed. Please, go to the forum and engage in the conversation about whether we want to incorporate and invest USDC in Circle. However, this does imply a risk for the protocol. Please consider this risk and give us your opinions. We spoke with Syndicate Protocol, who are working with traditional companies to start DAOs. They are using VC funds to hire the best legal teams to create legally compliant DAOs to invest those funds. Syndicate is now offering their services to DAOs and are interested in Maker. They will be posting on the forum within the following weeks. They believe they can help us diversify our treasury, USDC, to use and invest in traditional financial instruments such as bonds. This is interesting for us and is something to consider. I invite other CUs interested in incorporating their business to speak with Syndicate for help. We launched our Growth CU Twitter account! Follow us!   Content Production Core Unit Update  Seth Goldfarb 41:10 Content Production Biweekly Updates  We are excited to welcome some new hires! We onboarded a video producer and a writer. We are going to work through the backlog of content that\u2019s been amassing since our mandate. You\u2019ll begin to see a lot more content released from us within the coming weeks. It will mostly be on YouTube and Reddit. We continue to have conversations with CU regarding what they would like to see in the Community Portal. The plans are becoming clearer, but we are currently having an issue with Gatsby communicating with Github pages. If anybody has experience with React, please reach out. We\u2019ve begun outlining storyboards for requested educational videos. If anybody has video content they plan to upload regularly and want help with editing or MakerDAO branding, please reach out. We are looking for one more writer. We also made an offer to a community manager. Overall, we are continuing to onboard new team members. We will be announcing details on the art content to decide between the dragon and capybara as a mascot for MakerDAO.  Wouter: I read something about Maker Radio in one of the lists of wanted CUs. Is that connected to the CP CU or somebody else? Seth Goldfarb: I believe so. We have an account set up through Anchor to distribute audio to podcast platforms. It may be called Voices of MakerDAO now. But yes, we will be publishing the audio from our videos on there. We are brainstorming on appropriate content and getting things going with that. If anybody is interested in publishing podcasts or relatable content, please reach out.

We began last week as a port of the CS incubation program. Currently, we are a team of five developers and one designer. Our focus will be the MakerDAO Governance portal and voting. One of our first processes is to add voting delegation functionality to the Governance portal. We are in the process of hiring a full-time project manager to help us manage our work more efficiently. If anyone is interested, please reach out. You can learn more in-depth about our CU by watching last week\u2019s presentation with SES. We collaborated with GovAlpha on the UX and design, which is now approved.   1086\u00d7720 190 KB   This is the prototype for vote delegation. We split the deliverable between three sections; MVP, Version 1, and Version 2. We are currently working on the MVP, fetching the recognized delegates\u2019 information with a mix of Github repository that handles the profile picture, name, and description. We are showing a brief walkthrough of the delegation functionality by delegating some amount of MKR from a transaction. For example, we can delegate to a user, access that user\u2019s profile, and show some information.   1021\u00d7714 189 KB   We have some progress on how to define the vote delegate information of users. We created a Github with files, which we transfer to GovAlpha and another repository. This here shown is only for test purposes. We are already rendering this and crossing it with mock information to organize the UI. We will share a demo when we have more completed. We have a Discord Channel that you can join. Please, provide any suggestions and ideas.   Questions  Nik Kunkel: Should there be limitations on eligibility requirements for delegates? There could be a conflict of interest, such as CU facilitators who also want to be delegated.  LongForWisdom: We will have GovAlpha create some suggestions. We haven\u2019t worked on this yet and probably won\u2019t be part of the UI. Nik Kunkel: It\u2019s something we need to do sooner rather than later. We should make this clear from the get-go. It doesn\u2019t matter what we decide; we just need consensus on who can and cannot be a delegate. LongForWisdom: That\u2019s a fair point. We will consider it before launch. Payton Rose: The contract itself will be permissionless. It\u2019s just a say on who the showcase delegates are. LongForWisdom: Yes, there isn\u2019t a way to enforce someone or a group not to be delegated. The best we can do is not highlight it on the UI.     Open Discussion  Delay Onboarding Stablecoins into PSM 1:06:19  Nadia Alvarez: I want to let everyone know about the conversations we have with Binance, Paxos, and Gemini. It\u2019s now relevant since we are thinking of including stablecoin in the PSM.  Mariano: We are speaking with those companies. They are interested in being part of the PSM. We want to use that power of power as a negotiation tool. For example, Paxos is extremely interested in being part of the PSM. They have one of the biggest and most regulated infrastructures in the business. We are still reaching a form of agreement regarding things they can provide to the protocol. If we can delay the stablecoin voting into the PSM, it could help us be in the best position when negotiating with these companies. Nadia Alvarez: We want Paxos to include Dai in their APIs. Mariano: We ask them to implement Dai in all of their products like itBit, APIs, and Crypto Brokerage. Paxos are the service provider for PayPal and other big wallet institutions. The idea is for them to have access to Dai in their system; they can mint PAX and send it to the PSM to get Dai ready for their clients. We sort of had something similar with USDC in the PSM, except USDC does not directly own it. Instead, we are asking to own the entire process with PAX. Thereby, we can leverage their sets of APIs and their client base. We are in conversation with Binance with BUSD regarding the Binance Card and Binance Pay. We want to integrate Dai into these products. We know that negotiations with Binance took a lot of time. But they want to be part of the PSM. It would be really good if he had some time to negotiate this.   Christopher Mooney: You want Governance to hold back on voting on-chain or in the signal polling?  Mariano: On-chain so that we can have some time to negotiate and get a better deal for the protocol. LongForWisdom: I\u2019m not sure the negotiation position is strong given that the community has already indicated that they want the stablecoins voted in. Mariano: Yes, but we have been clear that essentially it\u2019s the on-chain vote that matters. They understand the process and are willing to follow the process. These companies see DeFi as something very interesting. They know we are practically the creates of DeFi with Dai. So we have a win-win situation, but we want to get the best deal possible.   Brian McMichael: What does it mean when they want to own the whole process? Is there a forum post about that?  Mariano: Not yet. We are still discussing it. If Paxos is accepted in the PSM, they can mint Dai, right? It also works the other way around: If they can receive Dai, send it to the PSM, get the PAX, the client can send USD. This is powerful because we don\u2019t have something like this available. I don\u2019t know any company that directly sells Dai by minting it through the PSM.   Frank Cruz: Paxos is a charter bank, correct?  Jen Senhaji: Yes, it\u2019s a trust company. Mariano: Paxos is also working on different things related to traditional finance, such as bonds, stocks, etc., which can be collateralized PAX. This can be used to indirectly onboard RWAs.   LongForWisdom: The signal process to on-chain process is looser than some of the other processes we have. Schuppi, since this is your signal request, do you believe this is a reasonable request to delay the onboarding of the stablecoins into the PSM?  crickets LongForWisdom: Okay, I will talk with Schuppi to see if we can do another signal.   Mariano: Regarding the prediction that Christopher Mooney put in the chat, I think that the DC plays a big role. USDC could have done the same thing with all the USDC we have now in the PSM.  Christopher Mooney: To clarify, the idea would be to create a PSM for GUSD or PAXUSD, which allows them in one transaction to mint a bunch of PAXUSD, tuck it into the PSM, get a bunch of Dai, send that Dai through the USDC-PSM, get a bunch of USDC and take custody of that USDC to start a redemption process where the newly minted PAX is backed by the USDC, which ends up in their bank account. Bridging to L2 has the same attack vector. Mariano: According to them, they aren\u2019t able to back PAX with USDC. Christopher Mooney: I\u2019m sure they will solve that.   Mariano: Another situation is this - Let\u2019s say we can negotiate a good deal, and we want to replace some of the USDC we have on the PSM. They can deploy 100M PAX into the PSM to get Dai exchanged for USDC, which they can sell for USD. Another operation can be to send the USDC to them, which can be sold for USD to mint for PAX, which will be sent to the PSM to provide collateral back. They told us that those dollars would be invested into T-bills, which have revenue that they can share with the protocol.  LongForWisdom: To be honest, that kind of attack would benefit us because we charge fees on money going in and out of the PSM.   Mariano: We are preparing a post right now. Keep an eye out on the forum to continue this conversation.  LongForWisdom: What are your estimates in terms of time required to conclude these negotiations? Mariano: According to what we discussed, it should take two to three weeks. LongForWisdom: Maybe we can determine a middle ground where we onboard them with a 0 DC. Mariano: That is more risk-related. Judging by their stance with the PSM, they want to be in it and start exchanging USDC. This could be an option, but it may take a lot more negotiation power if we already have them in the PSM. LongForWisdom: Okay, we will give it some thought.     Conflict of Interest for Delegates 1:21:30  Wouter: I was trying to understand better the concern that there is. Maybe Nik can elaborate a bit more?  Nik Kunkel: My concern is, let\u2019s say that I am the Oracle coordinator facilitator and also a delegate who amasses 15,000 or 20,000 MKR. I can do a budget increase and start voting for my self-interest. Wouter: If there is transparency with the facilitator of the CU, the expectation should be that you vote in favor of what the CU wants to see. As long as there is transparency, people would not delegate to you if they believe that is a risk. It\u2019s not necessarily bad to delegate as a facilitator is because we can move towards a model where CU will do exactly this; they will run an operation that figures out where capital should be efficiently allocated by using their delegation power to push the vote in that direction. This can even kickstart more representative voting rather than this plutocracy voting. Christopher Mooney: I share Nik\u2019s concerns. Wouter may be correct with transparency, but there is an overlooked problem that we may have with liability. Nobody on the PE team has any power where they are delegated crazy amounts of MKR. They can implement something but only as free speech where Governance gives guidance. You can\u2019t lay anything on the CU teams regarding liability. They don\u2019t have any power. Then you have teams with delegates at the head, which become more powerful actors and can lay a lot more liability at their feet. This is a caution to any teams participating who will put themselves as a delegator. Wouter: Liability is a good point, but it is separate. I believe that we have to move towards a more delegation model in terms of capital allocation. I agree that there is a challenge on a legal level, primarily why I haven\u2019t been more outspoken about it. Nevertheless, this is something we need to explore. We need CUs that specializes in capital allocation rather than assume that MKR voters will continue to micromanage. LongForWisdom: Nothing stops us from having a capital allocation CU present a proposal that the delegates can consider. It doesn\u2019t have to be the same people proposing to be voting for it. Kurt Barry: Wouter is making a fundamental point about the engineering limiting we have of the throughput of the human brain. At a certain point, one person can\u2019t vote knowledgeably for every proposal and parameter change. Wouter: What we see with the complexity of the RWAs shows that many people don\u2019t get properly understandable. This also goes in the other direction where we are a DAO with many discussions about Maker\u2019s vision. If we are truly decentralized, there will be multiple visions and opinions that will lead to different choices on capital allocation. Essentially, this doesn\u2019t move us from being decentralized, theoretically speaking. LongForWisdom: You\u2019re right. Capital allocation will eventually become a thing. However, I still have to consider this over the next few weeks concerning the current status of everything. Let\u2019s discuss this more during the next meeting.

We like people to get involved and ask questions or comments, so please, do not be shy if you have something to say.   Weekly Updates  Governance  Payton Rose 01:06  In terms of Governance for the week, the Executive from 2 weeks ago is yet to pass. we are 4,000 MKR away from passing. If you have not looked at that, I would appreciate you taking a look and supporting the Executive. There are a few things on there, but it does include CU budgets. Many CUs are waiting for their funds. Three polls from this week have already passed:  Adjust FLAP Auction Parameters Add MATIC as New Vault Type Increase RWA-02 (NS-DROP) DC     GovAlpha Core Unit update  LongForWisdom 02:38 GovAlpha Weekly Update  If anybody is against any particular votes, please either favor it or come to me to explain your opinion. I am convinced that the lack of voting is mainly due to voter apathy rather than actual objection, but if anybody wants to talk to me, please do. I\u2019d love to hear any opinion against any vote, especially the executive. We\u2019re continuing to work on Delegation. We now have a launch date of August 2nd. I\u2019ll be doing an announcement post sometime Monday, which will be a formal post. We\u2019ll schedule the Meet Your Delegate meetings within the next couple of weeks. There will also be additional sets of forum documents, and stuff publically posted that concern Delegation. Payton posted an on-chain technical design for SourceCred, which was produced by Kevin and Seth, I believe from SourceCred. Big thanks to them. - Finally, I\u2019ve been working with Derek on the coordination sheet for Governance to make mandated actors more transparent. We are all working on as well as the state it is currently in.   Forum at a Glance  Sebix 05:46 Forum at a Glance: July 8 - July 15  Three-Point Summary  Almost 5.5B DAI in circulation. 4.5 more to go till the 10B goal. The Surplus Buffer is about to hit 50M DAI for the first time. The Total Value Locked in Maker at $9.3B.   Discussions   What is a DAO anyway?   @g_dip shares a reflection from his blog on what a DAO is/should be, stirring many reflections on how those thoughts might apply to Maker.    Campaigning: Vote NO on \u201cInclusion Poll for AmaZix Marketing Core Unit MIP Set   @PaperImperium urges the community to reject the onboarding of the AmaZix Marketing Core Unit and shoots his allegation. @OldPaul from AmaZix replies back.    Prudential Treatment of Cryptoasset Exposures   @SebVentures brings a discussion on how regulators plan to view bank crypto-assets for evaluating the safety of their portfolios.    Strategic and Not Naive   @Do_Naam thinks we have to be smart about the usage of donations, grants, and liquidity programs, or it could backfire the DAO.     Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 08:18  We published the technical evaluation for stETH. It\u2019s worth reading because it may impact how much risk we assess and whether we want to add it. Regarding collateral onboarding, we\u2019ve been working on the Centrifuge DROP tokens. We\u2019ve got four Centrifuge assets in line right now. There have been many back and forth; No major errors, but we\u2019re trying to massage the Centrifuge additions to be really turnkey. We\u2019ve come up with a checklist for validating Centrifuge additions and were working for the Kovan spell to become the mainnet and the config to be easy enough to add multiple kinds. The Centrifuge guys just finished the Kovan version after some feedback right before this call. I was also deploying the mainnet versions of the contracts they need, but I ran out of gas. I\u2019m thinking that for Centrifuge, week\u2019s Executive will contain what\u2019s in the polling, but we\u2019ll likely include the DC raise for NewSilver and then get the Kovan assets out this week. Next Friday, we will probably end up doing the mainnet executive. Regarding SushiLP tokens, there was a miscommunication with the Sushi team. The pairs that we\u2019re interested in adding will not be moving over to the Sushi MasterChefV2 contract yet, which means we have prepared for this, which will take a few months. We\u2019re going to deploy with the current version of MasterChef; we\u2019re working on getting all of that ready to go. There were some changes across a few things. We also had to get liquidations ready for them, which meant that we had to update the exchange-callees contracts, ran some extra tests, and will be making updates to the DssCropJoin. For L2, we had the official announcement of DAI-Optimism-Bridge! This is huge, and I am super excited. We did many reviews to ensure that everything was denied correctly or relied / denied correctly on the bridge and whatnot to ensure that it is fully decentralized. The next milestone for L2 will be Arbitrum. We\u2019re also going to start looking at this Optimism-Fast-Withdrawal as well as publishing how to do that. We\u2019re. Also, we\u2019re planning to create an L2 risk framework. Regarding institutional Vaults, we have been working similarly to the Growth CU and crossing teams to define what this would mean. We produced a mock-up of this DssCharter, which is the initial implementation that will allow institutional or permission vaults to be created. We also wrote some GemJoin stuff around that, which we will have to go back and discuss more with the other teams. Regarding test nets, last week, I soft announced that we\u2019re going to Goerli and everyone should speak up or hold their peace. We\u2019re now committed to Goerli. I also want to shout out to @ultraschuppi, who managed to score us 20,000 Goerli. We\u2019re off to a good start and will begin making a deployment plan for getting everything onto Goerli. Next week, several team members are gonna be at EthCC. If you are there, you can meet up with us and chat. Some people who will be going are Sam, Derek, Bartek, and Kris. There is a variety of meetings that are planned with StarkWare, Nexo, and more!   Questions  Frank Cruz: Hey, I heard a rumor that folks are trying to monetize Goerli. Do you know if that\u2019s true or false? Also, when it comes to reorgs, how could they affect Liq 2.0? Chris: I haven\u2019t thought a lot on those topics, but reorgs are an interesting problem for Liq 2.0 because we have a price decrease function based on the block timestamp. In theory, if you get these deep reorgs, you could end up in this place where you can go like 10 minutes, and then someone\u2019s able to reorg 10 minutes worth of the blockchain, which would be a pretty big reorg. By the time that\u2019s finished, it would unwind the liquidation that happened within those blocks, and the price decrease function would actually be a little bit lower than 10 minutes later. There could definitely be some fallout from reorg-style stuff. I don\u2019t think we have thought through all of the heavy implications of a strong reorg regime, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s great. We can take that offline and discuss more.  Regarding Goerli, I am not entirely sure. The monetization of it would refer to monetizing GoETH, right? I thought that the network looked good, but then Andre released the news, stressing me out. All the faucets went dry, and we had to pay for it, but not much actually. However, one of the reasons we want to use Goerli is to test integrations using the real wrapped ETH. We need enough ETH to create some Vaults for deeper integrations into other projects. However, it looks like we will be getting more than the initial 20k we had asked for. Doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem at the moment.     Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 17:17  We managed to publish D3M module risk assessment today. We also proposed parameters such as DC and target borrow rate. These are the only two parameters needed for this module apart from the potential implementation of the DC instant access module, which would also include another two parameters. We proposed conservative parameters at launch, like the DC at only 10MM, but we noted that after a period of testing, we could increase DC up to 200 million. The report tries to describe all kinds of risks that Maker would be exposed to through this module. They are mostly related to Aave\u2019s solvency, liquidity, governance, and oracle risks. The part that is a bit riskier and worth emphasizing is where the module would not be working as we would want in certain edge cases. This would be a situation where there may be a potentially negative event at Aave. Funds would start flowing out. This would increase utilization levels, interest rates, and D3M module to increase exposure to Aave instead of decreasing it. It goes from bad to worse. The module does not know negative events are happening at Aave because the only input it uses is the borrowing rate. The only protection we could think of is implementing an Instant Access Module DC to limit the growth exposure of Aave within this scenario. Please read the report. I saw some good comments today which consider these risks and provide feedback especially related to the debt exposure that Maker wants to have. If you are to test this module now or really soon would be a good time because Aave liquidity mining rewards are potentially temporarily disabled in ten days, which might increase rates at Aave. If we had a D3M module, we could see it utilized and test it. We are still waiting for some smart contracts audits, so I am unsure how fast we can move here. Now that we have finished most of the risk assessments for collaterals and this module, we started focusing more on others in our backlog. We almost finished running simulations in regards to lowering LRs at Vault types. We are facing the issue right now because Vaults are currently well-capitalized because of the crash in May. Therefore, Vault\u2019s owners started to be more cautious, which is good, but the risk premium calculations show really low numbers. It might be misleading now, which means that the risk premiums are still good when we simulate lower LR. We want to run the same simulations on inputs that present a riskier behavior of users. We will probably try to focus on a period before the May crash when users were heavily leveraged to have a more balanced view about what happens if we lower the LR. Also, Chris mentioned there is ongoing work with institutional Vaults. Tomorrow, along with all the teams, we will hopefully finalize the proposal. You can expect an interesting proposal soon regarding these new Vault\u2019s offerings that are not solely for institutions but may also be for Ether.   Oracles Team Update  Nik Kunkel 22:07  Migration of the oracle feeds to the new kind of libp2p type of architecture is ongoing. We have done a very slow rollout because this is like a very big type of change, and we really wanted to ensure that there was no disruption of any service. So far, everything looks really good, and little by little, we are just adding to the number of feeds that were kind of including in this onboarding group. Within two weeks, we should be kind of fully transitioned over. Really proud of the team for the work they\u2019ve put into this. It\u2019s really paying off. We are also have been scrutinizing the DAI fast withdrawal bridge. A key to this fast withdrawal bridge right is an oracle-like mechanism that is basically looking at L2 and L1 by vouching that the transactions are legitimate. It helps us circumvent a one-week withdrawal delay that you typically see on an Optimism roll-up type of situation. We\u2019re evaluating what\u2019s really needed there by talking to external teams doing some internal research. We are trying to vet the trust assumptions here or the incentives and under what conditions do they break. We also want to know whether those are the same or riskier than the trust assumptions we already make regarding Oracles. For example, when talking about feeds, the feeds are essentially like a trusted validator set that Maker Governance is elected or delegated. Then in this circumstance, whoever is kind of deciding that or whatever the consensus mechanism is where you\u2019re deciding that these transactions seen on Optimism on L2 are running locally and verifying their transparency. You know this consensus game that you play where you\u2019d show that everyone agrees you know this is or is not legit. We see a lot of potential with L2. not just for DAI and Maker in general but also for Oracles in particular. from a business model POV, if DeFi shifts to L2, they\u2019re still going to need Oracles on there. And from a margins POV, the transactions on L2s are significantly cheaper. It makes delivering the Oracle service much cheaper, which is a very attractive business opportunity. L2 Oracles are not just for Optimism but also for Arbitrum and other L2s. Oracles are front and center. We\u2019ve already spoken to teams looking at launching on those chains regarding if they would be open to using Maker Oracles. We did a collateral onboarding assessment for MATIC. We will have to push back on the Executive vote for a couple of weeks because we\u2019re busy with the migration for libp2p. We don\u2019t want to have too many different Oracle versions kind of flying around. We want to get the upgrade out and then do the incremental changes involved for token onboarding, for example, MATIC. The earliest that we\u2019re looking at for MATIC onboarding is next week\u2019s Executive beginning August 6th, 3 weeks from now. That would be for tokens that require a feedback Oracle. Christopher reminded me that we\u2019re looking at the Sushi LP tokens. There is no roadblock from the Oracle side there because those are individual smart contracts that we deploy. There\u2019s no conflict there. From the Oracle perspective, we\u2019re ready to go on those whenever. Also, please pass the Executive vote. You know the Oracle CU is trying to spin out of the foundation at the end of the month. It\u2019s hard to do that when we don\u2019t have any money.   Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 29:02  I will start by thanking the Strategic Happiness CU for sending me cool Maker swag. It\u2019s my first one, and I\u2019m super happy to have them even if it was not easy to send the package to us. Regarding updates, we have an updated budget by @aes, it\u2019s not yet public on the forum, but as a teaser, I can say that if the community incorporates all the proposed CUs, we will lose money at the end of the month but still be cash flow positive. The difference between net income and being cash flow positive is the Maker tokens giving us compensation. James did a post on RealDAO SPV work, which is in progress. RealDAO SPV is based on Monarch and is a new way to bring an RWA on-chain by using a Monarch and other DeFi pure institutions to bring RWAs on-chain. We have a meeting today covering the NewSilver audit. There is a lot of stuff in there, and it will take time to unpack it, but it\u2019s interesting because it gave us a clear view of a real battle plan for on-chain securitization. The funny part concerns why the blockchain could be super interesting for securitization. There is a game we can play here to be a key element for the securitization of the ecosystem, which might allow us to increase the DC of those kinds of securities. not only NewSilver and Centrifuge but all those that are based on the same structure. Securitization above the DC has a drawback in that it will take a lot of time to implement everything. We need to add many legal complexities and align with what is happening in the real world. Regarding the Cayman Foundation, we have some news. We have started to get some documents on the Article of Incorporation and Memorandum. one of the main questions we currently have is who is in charge of this Cayman Foundation. My first post proposed to have Maker representatives\u2014three to five appointed people. But then we started to work on a MIP that we will be able to pass messages to the board of directors, saying that the board of directors has to do only what they are told by Maker Governance. So then you may say, you don\u2019t have to have real people as directors of the Cayman Foundation. Instead, we can have trustees who you pay and ensure to do whatever they are told. But then, there\u2019s another issue. Those people and trustees, in general, don\u2019t want to do much and want to be told almost everything every single step. That means that we will have to spend a lot of executives just to make them do something. Maybe it\u2019s not ideal. Maybe the best strategy is to combine Maker representatives and independent directors of trustees that will safeguard.   Questions  LongForWisdom: I like the idea of not having loads of things to put into executives. If we can come up with a hybrid team, that would be good.  Seb: Yeah, and that\u2019s the issue. If you\u2019re having to tell everything every week, it\u2019s quite complex to do.     Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 34:05 Growth CU weekly update  We have been having meetings with different projects such as Brave, Loopring, Decentraland, Kyber. We\u2019re waiting to meet with the 0x team to discuss why they are not using Maker Vaults. We want to have feedback from them and use that as input for the next steps in how we are going to abort these collaterals or if we want to abort these collaterals. The Community sentiment showed us that we should do it because they are not profitable, but I think that through this feedback, we can consider other outcomes besides profits. We can consider if it is a good PR for us or not, if it is a good partnership, or if maybe Maker Vaults could be a treasury management solution for these projects. As of now, they are not using Maker Vaults because of different reasons. In the case of Brave, they were using the BAT token to incentivize their community. In other cases, they do not have someone who has the strategy to manage the treasury, so they are not creating strategies. Although it is interesting to know, and I think that we all have to know that they want to keep their token as collateral on Maker. We are asking them to take the remaining debt available in the Vault. We will consider that as a good sign that they really want to be collateral on Maker. This is not an easy decision because they have to have internal meetings to evaluate the risk parameters and decide about opening the Vault. We are giving them until September 1st to see if they did it or not, and after that, we will evaluate the next steps. Regarding institutional Vaults, this will represent an increased Dai supply on our side but with the work that we are doing with different Core Units and by using NEXO\u2019s feedback to create this new product which I think is great. We are also in conversation with others interested in using something like an institutional Vault from Maker. They want to have access to a Dai loan, but we are having some problems. We are trying to figure out how to solve these problems regarding KYC and the new requirements that these big institutions may have. NEXO also has these needs, but they are more flexible since they are already using Maker Vaults. Suppose we really want to create a product focused on institutions. In that case, we have to think about having a 1:1 relationship to set agreements. For example, we could give them a larger Liq window because these large institutions are used to do that. We are talking to our legal counsel to understand all the KYC requirements. We are also trying to talk with different companies because we might not need to find a solution. Instead, we could make an agreement with a partner who could provide these services to these institutions. Concerning the PSM delay update, Mariano wrote in the post the updates we got from PAXOS. It is very interesting. They are working on an article to post in the forum to tell you all about this. What we want to achieve with PAXOS is to have access to their APIs. We would have something similar to what Circle has with USDC. We will be able to provide on-off ramps from USDC from Fiat to Dai using the PSM in the middle, but that will be transparent for the user. It is amazing, and we are working with PAXOS to make it a reality. We wrote two other posts. One is about future products and what we can create from the Maker Protocol. It does not have to be a product we create; it can also be a partnership that we establish. Please read it and provide us with feedback because it helps us understand the community\u2019s sentiment and bring more partners to the table. Last week, I mentioned Dai liquidity in other networks, especially in Thorchain. I wrote a post about why we should think about a solution for Thorchain and other networks. We are now seeing all these multi-chain ecosystems, so we should have a plan for this. Join the conversation in the forum, and we will be reading your feedback. Star of the week: This week, the integration between Oasis and the EPNS push notifications module was announced. This is great because it was something that our Vault users really need. They will be able through Oasis to get notifications that let them know different things about their Vault.  Tweet of the week: Through our handle, we spoke about the PSM and USDC along with the discussion that was on Crypto Tweeter for the last few days. We will be in Paris, so Gustav is talking about RWA. I will be talking about how to transfer from the Foundation to now being a part of the Community as a Core Unit with SES and PE team and GovAlpha; we organized this side event, \u201cKeeping up with the Maker Mafia,\u201d so if you will be in Paris, I expect to see you all there.   Questions  David Utrobin: Were you talking about having meetings with Brave, Loopring, Decentraland, and Kyber about what to do with their current Vaults and whether they support the community\u2019s decision to try to off-board them. Is that it?  Nadia Alvarez: Exactly.     Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling  Juan Guill\u00e9n 43:55  2240\u00d71270 168 KB   1958\u00d71085 238 KB   We are working on publishing OKRs. Hopefully, we will have them ready within the next couple of weeks. It\u2019s looking nice; I\u2019m very happy with the results. Also, as Nadia mentioned, we will be at the EthCC event next week in Paris. @linkla is going to be there collecting data and interviewing experts for the project X-Ray. last week, we had Nikolai and Wouter present Risks and Opportunities for the DAO. The video is already in the public folder, and we\u2019ll keep pushing on that same framework as well. Regarding tomorrow\u2019s call, Andy is going to define the roles and responsibilities within a CU. And tomorrow, we will be talking more about that in our SES updates at 2:30 UTC. Everyone\u2019s welcome to join, learn and give feedback. In other news, we have the Dai Foundation MIPs in RFC. Please give feedback. we already received a lot of feedback, and we\u2019re very happy with it. Regarding the incubees, we have 2 announcements:  One of them is the CU focused on auctions and liquidations, UIS, and services. Stay tuned for more, and hopefully, we get to scale the DAO and make it safer. The other CU that we are going to be onboarding is a bug bounty, which it\u2019s a coin that\u2019s going to manage a bug monthly program and security-related activities. We\u2019re quite happy with them and with the course of the incubation program. Nikolai is beginning an update on that next week next Friday. If you want to know more about that so, please tune in.   Regarding the community and myself, we were in a podcast a week ago, and it\u2019s live now with DaoHous called Houseparty on Twitter. On the EthCC side-event, I will be presenting SES in Maker in the W-source decentralized breakfast. Then we have Keeping up with the Maker Mafia on that same Wednesday. On Friday, we will be visiting the Daoist with Lenkla to speak about DAOs in general. Two future calls are coming:  B.Protocol Declaration of Intent KYP call will be hosted on November 8th. Another call will be an RWA: Collateral Onboarding with Untangled, which is to be dated.     Questions  Derek: One, I was curious about the auction UIs, and is the scope of that different from what the dUX team covers or is this an additional team that will create some applications or front ends for the liquidation systems?  Juan: It is going to be specialized not only in UIs but also in services. But it\u2019s going to be fully specialized in this; it\u2019s not dUX. Derek: Cool, looking forward to hearing more on that.   Christopher Mooney: I have a question about the team that we\u2019re bootstrapping for handling bug bounty stuff. Do we know who these members are? Maybe we can have a discussion with the PE in that team?  Juan: Yeah, we can definitely; let\u2019s talk about it. We\u2019ll set something up.     MIPs Update  David Utrobin 49:20 MIPs Update #44    1439\u00d7841 128 KB     1434\u00d7842 91.6 KB     1440\u00d7837 129 KB     1439\u00d7842 108 KB     1438\u00d7757 144 KB     1436\u00d7832 108 KB     1437\u00d7840 123 KB     1439\u00d7836 127 KB     1437\u00d7841 132 KB     1438\u00d7842 110 KB     Questions  LongForWisdom: Just a reminder that the Ratification Polls need to reach the 10 thousand MKR mark. They were a few CUs that were winning, but they had not reached the 10K mark. Just to remind them that you need to reach the 10K. If not, it is count as failing. I encourage people to go vote!   Presentations and Other Discussions  Open Discussion  Payton Rose 59:25  LongForWisdom: We were just talking about potentially including the new CUs budgets in the next executive if the current one does not pass. The idea would be to include the budgets in the next executive with a modifier to make sure that if the previous executive passes, then the budgets do not get sent again. This covers most cases. It does not cover the new executive passing and then the previous executive passing, but that seems unlikely.  Christopher Mooney: We could test to see if the old spell passed, and if it did not, in the new spell, we could have the budgets execute\u2026 Kurt Barry: The challenge is that if the new spell passes and the old spell passes after the new spell passed, you cannot prevent a double payment, but it does not seem like a big deal because you just do not send payments to those CUs the next month since they got a paycheck advanced. LongForWisdom: I think that is vanishingly likely to happen, and also it is low impact. Payton Rose: Some contingency budgets factored in with this, though, so maybe it is not the smoothest in terms of just renting another month. Kurt Barry: In the worst case, the CUs would probably play nicely. If they ended up being overpaid and needed to send some back or if we underpaid them, we could fill that out in the next month. LongForWisdom: It would be a minor fact to get it all sorted out, but it is probably something we can deal with if it happens. David Utrobin: We currently have somewhat of a positive vote for the Gov Comms Core Unit. Anything can happen, but in the meantime, in preparation for a positive outcome, we are looking for an engagement lead. We have two full-time people with a third that we are hiring. This engagement lead role would involve many cool things, including a quarterly engagement project with any stakeholder group. I will post the link about the role in the chat, and reach out to me if you are interested. If you are interested in hosting calls, engaging with stakeholders, leading engagement internally, reach out. Also, if anyone is interested in knowing more about the Gov Comms Core Unit, feel free to join the AMA tomorrow. I am going to be there answering all of the questions you have.   Andrew Burban: I think we should be selective on how we handle this out. Everyone knows that as much as anyone might want to get invested. People deserve to be vested; you are modest in what you request. Ultimately, Governance should be deciding how much Maker or an individual CU or person should be getting rather than putting in a request. I think it is more modest to leave it open-ended \u201chow much do you think we deserve?\u201d. Obviously, some CUs are more critical, and the whole thing would not exist without them, but although every person is valuable here, some talent is really scarce to find, so do not be too aggressive with how much you are asking; leave it up to the Community. PaperImperium: I do have a quick technical question. For Maker vesting projects, for easy reference, are those going to appear under MIP38 with budgets and facilitators and all the other key info on the MIPs\u2019 portal? Where is the fast place to find that for each CU?  David Utrobin: At the moment, all of the budgets are under MIP40c3. If you go into the MIPs\u2019 portal, you could check all of them out of that folder. At the moment, there are two CUs that have proposed their budgets and MKR vesting in one proposal, and that is PE and Oracles. In the proposed guidelines, we have the piece \u201cseparation of concerns,\u201d asking for CUs to put their budgets separate from the MKR vesting packages. So far, SCS has followed that guideline even though it is not formally ratified. Speaking as a MIP editor, I suggest people do that separation of concerns. They separate their actual budget that might be modified quarter to quarter from their MKR vesting package. You could find all of that under MIP40c3. PaperImperium: Thank you! That is very helpful. Juan: PaperImperium, did you mean about the tracking and having a list, or was it more about how it works? PaperImperium: No, just a quick reference that I can find where I can see every CU\u2019s allocation. Juan: Yes, exactly. I asked this to LongForWisdom on the forum. I do not think he had time to answer yet. There was MIP38, which was supposed to keep track of these CUs. Still, it was modified to not do it because the MIPs\u2019 portal is supposed to have filters where you can say, \u201cgive me all the sub proposals for MIP39 that are approved or that have been considered obsolete\u201d or whatever. So you can use these filters to actually access this information in a quite easy way. I am not sure where we are at with the MIPs\u2019 portal if those filters have been implemented yet if they are in a quick link to review. That might be the easiest way to do it, but it might not yet be available. PaperImperium: Thanks! LongForWisdom: It is both MIP38 and MIP38c2, but they might not be really up to date at the moment, and we do not have separate tags for MKR budgets versus regular budgets. There are just \u201cactive budgets\u201d filters. You can look at all active budgets. We could probably look into putting a tag that separates our MKR budgets from our Dai budgets. It makes sense.   Payton Rose: Thanks for those inquiries there. I find myself tempted to cut the meeting a little short today since it does not seem to be a lot of discussions. If you were planning on getting one last thing in, this would be your last chance to do so.  Andrew Burban: Anyone that I might have missed, which is probably most people, hit me up on rocket chat, and I will try to send you guys some stock. There are still a couple hundred left. David Utrobin: Has there been any updates from the Swag Shop CU? Andrew Burban: I think because they are still part of the Foundation, and until that is dissolved, their hands might be a little bit tied. I do not really know a lot of details. It would be cool to talk to them, but I cannot talk about them. LongForWisdom: The swag stuff or the urban stock stuff might be a good use of the Special Purpose Budget MIP if it passes. One of my concerns is that they are not CU, and they do not really have any responsibilities. It is still something that we probably want to pay for. Andrew Burban: Possibly is some people that are pretty happy getting the word out. It is hard to quantify what is the value of what I am doing, so I am not specifically asking for anything, but I am trying to log my expenses and see what I am actually spending on stuff. It is sometimes more, sometimes less. For years, I bought the original Dai socks, but while I was in Community Development, Amy was comping my expenses for shipping out to the combat members. Then the Community Development dissolves, and so does my funding for it, but I still want to keep sending some stuff out. It makes me happy to see other people happy. When we have high-quality stuff, people like to wear it, share it, show it off to their friends. I wear it five days a week. LongForWisdom: I think you mentioned in the chat that you paid 1800 dollars for shipping. It definitely seems like something that we should comp. Andrew Burban: That was literally 200 pounds of swag shipped to Africa. I understand why it was so much money. Going forward, I have been paying out of my pocket. It is ok, just a few transactions.   Payton Rose: That was nice. A few extra discussion topics. Keep it rolling if you have anything else on your mind. These calls are a great opportunity to have so many people for so many different parts of the ecosystem and general interest within Maker. Shoot your shot if you have anything else.

Welcome to the Scientific Governance and Risk meeting #137, taking place on Thursday, April 15th at 17:00 UTC. My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the Governance Facilitator at MakerDAO. If you have comments or you want to ask questions, please do interrupt.   Governance  Last week, we had a discussion about passing executives. Things were looking slow. Thankfully, after that call, we have gotten heavier participation from some larger MKR holders, which is good to see. We managed to pass the executives during the past two weeks. These executives included Core Unit budget distributions for April involving increases to the DC. Last week, we had a NewSilver drop to go into the protocol. This week, the plan is to have Liquidations 2.0 in the executive because it is a significant change. We will turn that on for Link and authorize all the Liquidations 2.0 contracts.   Polls  We had a set of inclusion polls as part of the monthly Governance cycle this week, which had all passed. We will have a MIPs update later. We also had a signal based on the petition letter to A16z pushed by iammeeoh that passed; There were 4000 MKR in favor and almost none against it. We did have 8000 MKR abstaining, which is interesting. It feels like people are unsure when voting on this sort of thing. We also passed the parameter changes proposal. The poll for that succeeded with 60000 MKR in favor. We will probably push this back by one week due to Liquidations 2.0. It will go into next week\u2019s executive rather than this week.   Governance Alpha  The Governance Core Unit posted a delegation plan to the Forum that introduces delegation and shares the path we will take forward. This was also an open call for people that would be interested in potentially being delegates. If you are interested, please reach out to me. We\u2019ve also been continuing with onboarding Prose and Elihu. We\u2019ve got an initiative to perform an inventory of the current MIPs we\u2019ve got. We want to look at them and find any that may be obsolete given some of the new changes. If we were to find any, we might perform some edits on them.   Signal Request Forum  I did some minor category changes in the Forum to make Signal Requests neater. When you now access the Signal Request Category, you\u2019ll see the active Signal Requests instead of seeing a huge thing showing everything in existence. The MIPs portal work continues. Generally, this week I\u2019ve been dealing with internal Governance software processes, like getting people paid. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.    Weekly Updates  Forum at a Glance  Peyton Rose 05:17 Forum at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated.  Three Point Summary  The bulls are out in force with MKR price hitting an ATH above 3,300 DAI   ETH-A usage is currently sitting just above 1.75B DAI, closing in on the first vault type to pass 100M DAI in annualized stability fees. DAI peg is stronger than ever, with DAI Deschipher reporting a 7-day VWAP of $1.0!   Announcements  ETH-A continues to be utilized. We are up to cover over 1.75 billion, and we are close to passing 100 billion in annualized stability fees. According to DAI decipher, other great news is that the Peg is looking outstanding, sitting around at 1$ flat.  Announcing MakerDAO\u2019s Community Blog 2!  Tim made the post, and he\u2019s working with a bunch of other really great people in terms of giving us space where you can contribute, write articles, explain things that are happening in the Maker ecosystem.    @mrabino1 shared the 6s - RWA001-A - Document Roadmap  Take a look at all the awesome work being done to onboard Real-World Assets!     Discussions   Activating MKR Staking Rewards   @hexonaut breaks out the diagrams on how much Staking Rewards could pay MKR holders who lock their tokens in Governance.    A Series of Questions About Strategy   @seth asks some critical questions about the future growth of DAI and the Maker protocol.    Informal Poll - Increasing the SourceCred payments   @mrabino1 asks the community how they would feel about increasing payments to contributors via SourceCred.     Signal Requests   Adjust Liquidation Ratio for UNI-V2-DAI-USDC-A Vault Type   @monet-supply signals lowering the liquidation ratio for UNI-V2-DAI-USDC-A to encourage more participation in the pair.     Smart Contracts Team Update  Christopher Mooney 08:15  The Coinbase IPO and Berlin hard fork happened yesterday. There was a bug in the open Ethereum clients that caused them all to have a consensus error. All the open Ethereum nodes across Ethereum froze. We\u2019ve been working on making sure things are ok. Oracles are the most critical infrastructure. This is a well-planned failure case at the foundation. We should continue to take care of this issue in the DAO. Still, we have plenty of node redundancy; we run Dai on parity. We could flip over anything that was on parity. The fix is out. The parity node should come back online, which you should see across the ecosystem. The MIP22 spell went to the mainnet and passed. We\u2019re waiting for that to execute tomorrow. We had to cycle back and deal with some issues in Kovan, such as changes in the token name, which were updated on Kovan. I posted those updates in the collateral onboarding updates channel. Everything is patched up in Kovan so that Kovan matches the mainnet. With regards to MIP45, which is Liquidations 2.0, it\u2019s already been on Kovan. The addresses are in the collateral onboarding updates channel. We\u2019re working on the Dss deployment scripts to finalizing. In parallel, we\u2019ve been working with lots of different teams, keepers, and other services to ensure Liquidations 2.0 works. We updated the HackerOne bug bounty program to reflect the new contracts\u2014happy bug hunting for anyone out there. We will update the MIP45 audit links later today. You can go to security.makerdao.com to view the audit reports. One of them is missing, but we will get them out. We\u2019re preparing for YFI next week. We\u2019ve got the tight cadence that will begin happening. We have to go to Kovan with next week\u2019s bundle while also going to mainnet with the prior bundle that will persist for about the next 4-5 weeks. We got some review of the Sushi Join Adapter happening. ABDK, who\u2019s auditing it, came back with a response. We\u2019re currently looking at those and are planning to get it done to send back responses by next week. There\u2019s also OmegaPoker in review, and the delegate voting contract that LongForWisdom alluded to earlier is under development.   Oracle Team Update  Nik Kunkel 14:23  Last night, we had the Berlin hard fork. There is no issue with the oracles upfront, and everything is working as expected. Regarding the Defi Saver, we have voted them to be a light feed. They\u2019re dealing with some stuff on their end right now. They haven\u2019t set up their light feed just yet,. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re key to this week\u2019s executive vote. We can try to do it next week and add in the executive vote.   Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 16:15  We released liquidations parameters for the YFI vault today, which is supposed to have a new liquidation system implemented the following Link. Link is this week, and YFI will be next week. Also, next week, we\u2019re proposing ETH and WBTC liquidation parameters that will likely be slightly different due to liquidations ratios being a bit lower. We might want to settle these auctions a bit earlier; instead of 40 mins expected auction duration, we propose a shorter duration for vault types like ETH-B. These vaults have higher risks of MKR. Packaging proposed parameters are mostly identical to those we recommended last year. However, we\u2019re still waiting for the PAXG team to answer the concerns brought up on the forum. We\u2019re waiting on feedback following contact of this MIP. @Monet-supply made a post regarding increasing the minimum threshold for emergency shut down. We\u2019re mostly focused on the risk web app, which I mentioned in one of the previous calls. We plan to have all the risk recommendations, risk premiums, DC, and value risk calculations all in one place on a web app. community members or future analysts can look at how we calculate things as well as automating calculations. The amount of assets in the Maker portfolio is increasing and will continue to grow. Once we finish liquidations, we will be onboarding assets. JoeQ: Let\u2019s discuss the liquidation times for those vaults. That\u2019s the problem we had before. I know we\u2019ve worked towards it. We can have open hours to discuss it before we go live on the big ETH vault.  Primoz: We can happily have this discussion along with incentivizing Gigs. Wouter: You spoke about the expected auction duration. Is that the moment when the price curve hits the OSM price? Primoz: No, that\u2019s when the price curve hits the market price, which depends on whether the market price is steady from the time the OSM price feed we got. It\u2019s 40 minutes on average, but if the MKR price increases, it\u2019s earlier. If the price crashes additionally, it\u2019s later. Wouter: You run different simulations and took the average? Primoz: Yeah.     Real-World Finance Team Update  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 22:10  Aes released a framework for evaluating the MKR price. Some may be reading it because the MKR price is rising but still under the model\u2019s fair value. It\u2019s still a good value for the purchase. This is not investment advice. Thanks to the Operational Support team, we have a new finance website that tracks every main item we have under Finance, such as presentations and stuff. Big news: New Silver onboarding was done on Monday and validated the next day. It will be in the executive tomorrow. We expect to potentially have the first draw on the loan next week. There\u2019s a call tomorrow discussing that focusing on RWF in more detail. If you have questions on this collateral, feel free to join, and we can discuss that or any other subject you like. Lastly, we have onboarded for two collaterals regarding scheduled collaterals; 6S is midway through the onboarding process. We discussed with the Smart Contracts team to onboard at least one collateral per month beginning June. We have a pipeline of almost ten collaterals to onboard, which will fill until the end of the year. This might lead to prioritizing or pruning the pipeline. I\u2019m not sure how to do it. I still need to figure out what needs to be done. If you have thoughts about how you want RWA to be onboarding in the next few months or prioritizing, that would be helpful. There are many paths we could take from here. One path would be to onboard the smallest collateral because we are still in the experimental phase. Hence, onboarding the smallest is less risky. Even if there is a problem, it wouldn\u2019t be as significant. However, it doesn\u2019t move the needle. We still have a lot of USDC to use. Another option is to decide that some collaterals are better. Solarex is a project to use 100 million Dai. That may be more interesting because Solar farming is in the NY state. It may be less risky compared to trade finance companies, but, at the same time, trade finance companies can help us reach new customers in Asia. There\u2019s always a trade-off, and it\u2019s not clear what should be decided. At some point, the Community should participate in the discussion and give any feedback.  LongForWisdom: Regarding the concerned need to choose a direction, it is a complex subject. Others may feel similarly. If you are looking for direction, it\u2019s worth putting together potential options you had mentioned and documenting them with more detail, pros, and cons, etc. Seb: Yes. I will post a summary in the forum to trigger the discussion.    ",

We\u2019re launching tomorrow with real-world finance. This is a space where existing core units can detail information and take questions from the community on what they are doing. We\u2019re happy to make one with you. We had a declaration of intent on EURO-DAI. The KYM number 6 last Friday with Seb and ultraschuppi went well. We had a call yesterday with a SolidBlock. 2 weeks from now, we will have MCO2, which neutralizes carbon emissions. Monday, we will have a call with David on the Governance Communications Core Unit. On Wednesday, we will have Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling by Wouter and me. Amy posted the representative of working groups. This will help those less connected regarding the Maker compensation working group LongForWisdom had posted.  LongForWisdom: We are waiting to fill in the third-party slots, and then we will begin.     Community Development Team Update  Anna Kryukova 29:57  For the last couple of months, our focus has been wrapping upon many projects, including navigating the transition from community development as a department bootstrapped by the foundation to people and projects transferring over to the DAO. I will spotlight a few projects today.  Design - Brand Assets Figma - Brand Assets   One of the contributors in community development, Shea, has been working on the community development portal. Many illustrations have created a project called brand assets which takes inspiration from foundations branding. However, we made our own to use for the community. Shea created a document where anybody can create graphics. There\u2019s also a PowerPoint presentation, including instructions. The community development portal launched a Maker Community Blog where anyone from the community can contribute to.

Open Discussion 39:45  Emergency Shutdown Module  LongForWisdom: We want to discuss the emergency shutdown module MKR threshold in more detail. For those who don\u2019t know, this is the amount of MKR required to trigger an emergency shutdown in the protocol. It\u2019s currently set to 50,000 MKR. It\u2019s useful if, in the event of a Governance attack for MKR holders gracefully shut down the protocol. It\u2019s useful in minority threats encouraging Governance to reach a consensus on some things rather than leave a significant part of MKR holders unhappy. In the past, it has been a backup in case there\u2019s any critical bug that we weren\u2019t able to safely fix. Smart Contracts team can discuss this more, especially around Liquidations 2.0.  Chris Mooney: I\u2019ll take that invitation. Tomorrow we are planning on releasing a forum post that discusses the ESM. We have to update the ESM as part of the Liquidations 2.0 update. For the end to function properly, it needs to be able to yank existing auctions. We will update the ESM, and since there are no administrative functions on the ESM, this seems like a good time to update the amount of MKR in the threshold. We could do it at a different time, but we are already making these changes. Therefore, we may do it tomorrow. That\u2019s the general point of the discussion. Does anybody want to weigh in on that? LongForWisdom: When you stated that it has no administrative functions, do you mean to change the MKR value? Would we need to redeploy and replace the contracts? Chris Mooney: Yes, that\u2019s right. The module itself is extremely pure because there is no Governance ability for us to change anything in it. Because it is partly intended to be used in a Governance attack, we have to pre-deploy it with the values we want. If we were to do that, we have to update it for Liquidations 2.0. We would then also update it if Governance has decided they want to change the MKR value. Brian MacMichael: This is something that came out of the mandated actors\u2019 call and maybe a little bit of risk, as well. Due to the spell being tomorrow, there\u2019s no chance to go through a full Governance cycle. I don\u2019t think anybody has any opposition to raising the MKR threshold. It\u2019s very expensive, but the number of assets under management is greater than when we had deployed the system. We would like to know if anyone has strong objections against raising the threshold, in which case it would have to go through a full Governance cycle.   Kurt: Just to add a little color on how to think about this threshold. This is one of the most complex and hotly debated areas of Maker protocol Governance game theory. You don\u2019t want the threshold set too low because then it\u2019s too cheap for somebody who doesn\u2019t like the system or has a big MKR short to come and cause chaos and shut the thing down. On the other hand, if you set it too high, you might have trouble rallying that amount of MKR in an emergency scenario where it needs to be used. One of the purposes is as an honesty minority can shut down the protocol and protect it from a Governance attack. It doesn\u2019t make sense to set it to an amount of MKR that\u2019s more than half of the circulating supply. That module would be pointless, then. It\u2019ll be weird to raise the threshold as the MKR price increases. Usually, you would think that it would go in the opposite direction. One way to go about trying to set it is to target a certain amount for security. There are other considerations such as MKR distribution and considering how many large individuals it would theoretically take, etc. It\u2019s something that requires careful game-theoretic consideration, and that\u2019s why it tends to be hotly debated.  Primoz Kordez: @Monet-supply from our side recommended this threshold to be raised to 75,000 MKR. I think it\u2019s a good value because we see that the amount of MKR bought on borrowed is currently 50,000. There are, of course, downsides to increasing very high. As Kurt said, it\u2019s mostly related to how quickly we can trigger an emergency shutdown. I believe that we have recently shown that we can get some MKR activated very quickly through a bit of campaigning. I think that the 75,000 MKR threshold is good. I even think a 100,000 could work, but it will be more difficult if we need to react, for instance, within an hour or so. This issue concerns knowing who the biggest MKR holders are, how quickly they can react, and how we can reach out to them. Monet-supply also suggested preparing a continuity plan to give us a better idea of the appropriate amount. Monet-supply: My post was fairly long-winded. The idea is we need to find the correct balance based on evidence of MKR threshold vs. safety. The obvious threshold for that is the amount of MKR you can short. Suppose an emergency shutdown happens out of the blue. In that case, the token might be worth hardly anything at that moment, so we need to find the balance between making sure that it\u2019s more than you can borrow on AAVE and other places but also low enough where we can actually reach the threshold. Figuring out what\u2019s too high involves testing a regime for some of these emergency situations and implementing those who have significant holdings who want to participate. We need to be professional with emergency shutdown testing. That is something I\u2019ll be working on in the next couple of weeks. Brian McMichael: For those that are not familiar with the ESM, it irrevocably burns the MKR that\u2019s depositing to it. Even if someone borrows the MKR, they are committing to burning that MKR forever. In the case of a shutdown, if we were to redeploy the system and the burner or if multiple burners were honest participants, we would be able to mint back to those people.   LongForWisdom: It\u2019s worth noting the potential shorting situation. Anyone making a short attack would need enough MKR to sell before triggering a shutdown. They need to have enough MKR to lock in the contract and more MKR to sell to profit. I don\u2019t know how much that would be, but they would need an excess of the ESM amount, probably by at least 10 or 20%.  Monet-supply: You need to have enough MKR tokens to trigger the ESM, but you could short pretty much everything in DeFi based if Dai blows up. You need enough MKR to trigger it, but there are innumerable ways to profit from Maker blowing up. LongForWisdom: I agree. You need the capital to trigger the shutdown and also to spend on the shorts. However, there is an absence of heavy opposition. We are going to conclude that the increase to 75,000 is in the Liquidations 2.0 update. As Brian said, it does skip the regular Governance Cycle, but it saves us a little bit of time. We had the off-chain Governance poll that supported the increase. We also had the report that @monet-supply produced, which suggested 75000 to be a good amount. Kurt: There is a strong argument that you should aim to be higher than what someone could borrow on the market. With the MKR supply up to a million, being at 7.5% of total supply, seems like a reasonable threshold. LongForWisdom: I agree. I don\u2019t see a problem with it being 75,000. We could rally up that MKR if we needed to in an emergency. Christopher Mooney: Yes, we technically just did.   Kurt: We want to think about having some sort of voluntary opt-in like a pager system for big MKR holders who want to be on call. Their availability is the hardest part of getting the ESM triggered in time. Hopefully, you have a Governance delay of two days as for most cases. For extreme cases, if it\u2019s an oracle attack, you may only have an hour. In which case, it might be better to use the oracle freeze module, but you still need to rally enough MKR holders to overtake the hat, which could lead to even more MKR. The DAO should think about having an organized system to send out an emergency alarm and be able to get sufficient MKR liquidity online ready to act in a short time frame.  Wouter: That is something that may be in scope for a new Core Unit proposal. LongForWisdom: This is something that we are going to start looking at in Gov Alpha. We will try to put together emergency contact details for some of the larger MKR holders. As you said, this will be important going forward. Kurt: Ideally, you would have a broadcast system that people could subscribe to. Privacy would be respected, of course. LongForWisdom: Yes. that would be ideal. It would just be a matter of contacting large MKR holders and getting them to sign up. Wouter: One of the challenges is not the only situation we might want to set the alarm for. For example, Liquidation events happening on-chain to do with other signals that indicate suspicious behavior. That might need different responses from different people. Looking a little bit further ahead, it will be good to have a service that allows different profiles of responders to subscribe to different alarms. One that I think will come up soon concerns minor expectable value alarms where you can compare the distribution of blocks that are being mined by different miners to the distribution of MKR transactions that are being mined. These are all examples of various alarms that may require different responses. It would be nice to have a service where you can see these scenarios and subscribe to the ones you would like to help with. LongForWisdom: That\u2019s a fantastic idea.     Liquidations 2.0 Module  Payton: I have a question regarding the Liquidations 2.0 Module. Looking into many newer auction-based methods for making token sales or trying to avoid the MEV problem, many of them are similar to the Liquidations 2.0 parameters. I\u2019m curious about how simple it would be to decide to mint and sell MKR or do an open market operation? Could we use the Liquidations 2.0 framework to achieve the fundraise? In this case, could we reverse the tokens if we take Dai for collateral while trying to get MKR?  Brian McMichael: There are a lot of patterns out there for the Dutch auction-style. We would not be able to use Liquidations 2.0 because it\u2019s so tight to the existing Vaults. However, there is plenty of precedent torque for Dutch auctions if you want to perform a capital raise. Christopher Mooney: Are you speaking about collateral liquidations or about surplus and debt auctions? Payton: That is interesting. I haven\u2019t thought about surplus and debt auctions. We were having the minting vs. not minting argument. Having a way to buy in an open market would be important if you try to avoid minting. Christopher Mooney: Yes. A further off-plan is to shift these flap auctions to something similar to the Dutch auction mechanism. We could do the same with flop auctions. Flop auctions start out a little high. Therefore, we pick a different starting price for the flop auction, which is wildly low at this point\u2014that may be a parameter that we should consider updating. The downside is that both of these auction types kick off from the Vow, a hardcore contract to change in our system. we are much better off doing collateral liquidation and seeing how this stuff performs. There is a yearly horizon plan where we hope to replace the Vow and get features like having ilk specific sin cues, which are the delays between flop auctions. We also want to add the Dutch auctions into flap or flop auctions for the surplus and debt auctions. Payton: That\u2019s awesome! I had no idea. Cool!   Christopher Mooney: The whole team needs to do something not auction-related for a few months at least! Payton: I wonder why! Hint: CropJoin. Nik Kunkel: We\u2019ve got the audit now.  Christopher Mooney: Yes, that was in my update. We are looking at CropJoin right now. Nik Kunkel: There were no major issues found in the audit. We saw a couple of rounding errors, and everything else is cleaned up. Brian McMichael: We have these little things that shouldn\u2019t take very long to get out the door, such as the box, the keg, the flash mint, and things like that which we pushed off for Liquidations 2.0. We will still be working on Liquidations 2.0 for the next couple of months. We will be getting these piecemeal out of the door every week. The spells involved are quite large. We\u2019re not going to be able to do them all at once unless we can figure out a pattern for multi-part spells, but we might be rolling these out two or three at a time until we get up to speed.     CropJoin, LPs, and v3  Payton: Concerning CropJoin, are we looking for the Sushi implementation, or does the audit work for something like Compound?  SamM: Compound is more complex than Sushi because it relies on recursive leverage. We want to go with Sushi first, but it could pave the way for implementing Compound. Christopher Mooney: It\u2019s an extensible base class. Therefore, it should be easy for us to take advantage of other types of Crops; we just need to write the code on top. Brian McMichael: We found a good market fit with these Uniswap LP tokens. However, v3 brings some concerns with loss of liquidity. Sushi doesn\u2019t plan to upgrade, which will give us plenty of liquidity. Nkunkel: Balancer, Bancor, and other similar tokens will probably follow their own unique growth instead of copying each other or copying Uniswap. The Uniswap v3 did screw us over, but I am optimistic with LP tokens over the long term. Brian McMichael: This doesn\u2019t mean Uni v3 won\u2019t work. We need the community or Uniswap team to standardize a token version of their new model if we cannot use their official model. Nkunkel: It\u2019s also about liquidity being actively managed in v3. Suppose somebody submits a huge order that absorbs all the liquidity in a person\u2019s position. In that case, that can cause people to end up all in one token. A lot of LPs are removing their liquidity or temporarily performing infinite bound liquidity. However, tokenizing a particular LP range will require knowing the most efficient range width. Too small of a range will cause a loss of uniformity. Too large will risk more capital efficiency. Kurt: As the market figures it out, passive strategies will naturally come out and become implemented by the community.

Forum at a Glance Forum at a Glance September 30th - October 7th  Team-led Discussions  Case for Clean Money  Rune Christensen The case for Clean Money  Clean money can provide positive global branding. Positive global branding promotes higher use-case, volume, and worldwide adoption for Dai and MKR.  This branding and its message need to be front and center.   Centralized Financial system is too deep in its problems to restructure itself to solve issues like Climate Change. This initiative may come with legal and other risks, depending on how people view Maker\u2019s intentions. Following this initiative can also promote more transparency and organic growth of Maker.  This will lead to happy employees, users, and associated organizations.   The following steps (proposals, ideas, etc.) should be done as a decentralized community.  First, we should create a consensus for key principles. Does the community agree with this? Write out tangible steps going forward.   Concern by Wouter: MakerDAO has often changed its direction, and some people do not like it.  It may cause some people to opt-out and disagree, but it may open new doors and users.

I\u2019m happy to come back to the governance calls and talk about this. I haven\u2019t prepared the slides, and I came today to discuss this more pressing legal question that I think is also really important. There are so many concepts interconnected, and in reality, what it all represents is sort of all the thinking and all the research I\u2019ve done maybe for the past five years potentially, which was pretty much the last time I was able to be publicly involved in Maker governance, right. During a very long period, primarily from the sort of out of regulatory concerns, I\u2019ve just had to create this kind of separation between my role and the bootstrapping Maker team and then having a role as an MKR holder. When the whole thing started, the thing that attracted me so much was the idea that all I needed to do was write a white paper, and then sort of free-market will somehow take care of it, and it will be built or something, right. And, then it was like, Oh, we just need to get this team together, and then it will become a down, and we\u2019ll take care of itself. And then you know, the late I was like oh, we just need to make this foundation and then we just need to build the thing and we\u2019ll then I can that can sort of sit back and relax, and it will take care of itself. And now we\u2019re done with the foundation. And you know, and now I\u2019m basically at this point where Oh yeah, you know, All we need now is like make it a purpose-driven down and put a bunch of things in place and sort of really make this constellation everything set up. So we can have this ice age, but that\u2019s sort of that\u2019s I mean fundamentally that\u2019s always been my upset you know, it\u2019s not even the point of maker right is a real sort of autonomous kind of like you know locked down the system to some extent right I mean that\u2019s the promise of the whole system right. Then I think Additionally there like we were Megan has always been an extremely, you know, value-driven movement right and project. Still, it\u2019s been quite different from most of the rest of crypto and DeFi in that we\u2019ve been at this, you know, both been very idealistic and sometimes even been sort of arrogant in a sense and different in that way. And you know, that\u2019s basically like I think fundamentally, it is who we are, but it also connected with all these other things. And all of these pieces are there really yeah, I think fundamentally, they\u2019re, they\u2019re, like they\u2019re, they\u2019re, they\u2019re interconnected and necessary and really, in my opinion is like the, it\u2019s sort of it\u2019s really our best like, from my perspective, it\u2019s almost the only way forward in a sense right and then in that we need a need we need a plan a kind of holistic plan that can do the same I can do something like you know, they can sort of cover all the things we need to cover and and give us clear direction and how do we get to a point where things are going to kind of calm down and because I mean, no matter what, basically, um, I will eventually leave I mean, that\u2019s my that is my that\u2019s gonna happen one way or another PCB and and but the way I would like to do it is that I can simply sort of, you know, everything can run by itself and I can just sit back as an MKR holder that delegates and locks into some tokenomics in general or whatever, whatever it is, we end up with but but the point is that selama you know, that\u2019s really the the ideal outcome right? Because so and so. So that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from as an MKR holder, essentially right that I\u2019m basically like really big MKR holders that. You know, wants to not be involved, but it\u2019s impossible for me when I have so much exposure to the project. There\u2019s not enough sort of, you know, there\u2019s simply not enough certainty for someone like me with such an extreme exposure to not go into free, and I mean, you could that\u2019s a way to think about it that I\u2019m at the level of exposure MKR where I\u2019m compelled to participate in governance to protect my interests. Okay, so, so that I mean, that\u2019s one of the many perspectives, right. Another one is to talk about, You know, climate change in the collapse of the whole world wage base; I think I want to mostly skip over that, honestly. Like, I think I mean that is but yeah, like, you know, I have I\u2019ve got kids now which is different, you know, so I used to be sort of a collapse Attarian with Bitcoin, and you know, the end of you know, the economic meltdown, all this stuff that was going to be thought was going to happen, you know, a decade ago, but it gets very different once you have had children. And you have this different sort of time. Lines sort of perspective in terms of time and, and yeah, like, it is. It is just it\u2019s like climate change is like it\u2019s what\u2019s called a black elephant. It\u2019s like a combination of Black Swan and the elephant in the room. In that, it\u2019s, yeah, it is actually. And there\u2019s like no good answer to it. It is working or contributing towards the future or sort of building something up. If you\u2019re not like, directly. Oh, yeah, great, my internet is failing. Because I got a new iPhone that did come back in, so that\u2019s my, that\u2019s my fancy 5g that\u2019s working way worse than my five-year-old phone. So that\u2019s a no but now what my What I\u2019m saying is that, because of what\u2019s happening is like, if you\u2019re anyone working on anything and sort of building something for the future. If they\u2019re not like directly dealing with basically the coming collapse of the system, the face should just not waste time; they should go outside and enjoy nature while it\u2019s still there. And that\u2019s kind of how I, you know, that\u2019s one of the ways I think, to think of this is just like, I mean, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, most people for most people still aren\u2019t apparent today. But it will, over time, increasingly become apparent that this stuff will dominate everything in our lives. And you\u2019re just not going to be like, you know, it\u2019s not going to be meaningful to work on something else. Because it like first it will be about sort of protecting the world and eventually will be about protecting yourself. And yeah, I  17:31  David Utrobin: One thing that struck me is like, really interesting about your post; the case for clean money is this idea of incentivizing an entire solution through, you know, advantageous credit facilities and partnerships, and funneling capital to startups, businesses, etc., etc., that are making a positive impact on the problem. And I\u2019m curious whether your vision has room to expand beyond climate change. So climate change is, of course, one of the biggest problems and, you know, it\u2019s pertinent and worthy of focus. I\u2019m curious what other problems you see maker doubt potentially influencing positively through our protocol? And can we and should?  18:27  Rune Christensen: Yeah, so it\u2019s like, okay, so I want us to talk about that by talking about something completely different first. But that is, says this concept of it\u2019s the question of like, Oh, I mean, I wrote that somewhere in the post, right? This idea of like, Oh, yeah, climate change. So that means now we\u2019re going to be charity, and be sort of Kumbaya and throw our money away or something, right. And that\u2019s kind of the that\u2019s sort of, you know, that\u2019s how it\u2019s traditionally viewed, right? And what I\u2019m saying is that especially the front, especially the exact position makers, and right now, we were actually in a situation where, like, profit, you know, the public benefit, and the personal benefit, as the profits, they\u2019re converging, in a sense, like, we, like this is this direction that I\u2019m advocating for, I believe, is by far the most profitable direction we could take. And what and, and it\u2019s like, when you think about it, it kind of makes sense. I mean, like, as, you know, if you\u2019re sort of, you know, if you\u2019ve been conditioned by capitalism, then the statement that like doing good should also be the most, the most profitable, that mess. That seems like complete nonsense, but like, if you\u2019re going to think about it, logically, that is kind of how markets work, right? Like that\u2019s how sort of and how it would make sense like even doing something as good then that means there\u2019s still value there. And that\u2019s how you should. You know, that\u2019s what should be; we should be able to extract value out of that in some sense, right? And that is, like absolutely the case for the economic system and the financial system, right? That nobody, I mean, it\u2019s not very profitable to destroy the planet, right? Like, nobody\u2019s going to, like the oil executives, kids will be in trouble too, right? Like, no one\u2019s going to get a benefit, right? It\u2019s this, what\u2019s happening is, it\u2019s not like, some conspiracy, or some kind of some people that are somehow like, you know, taking advantage of everyone else, it\u2019s like, literally this huge coordination problem that the whole world is engaged in, that\u2019s just sort of failing and, and turning out badly. And that\u2019s where, if you can, like, the question is, is it possible to try to overcome that coordination problem? And then can you extract sort of, can you kind of like, like, if you can overcome the problem, you will create incredible amounts of value? And is it possible to sort of tap into that future value and then use that as a sort of energy to power them? The push towards trying to overcome this? Right. And, and so so I think that it\u2019s from ultimately it\u2019s from that perspective, that that I mean, in the end, like, that\u2019s how 1000 has to work, that, you know, that like, it, we have to make our decision based on what\u2019s benefiting us as MKR holders, like so. So the question is kind of what\u2019s the, what are the actions that we can take that, that just provides us, you know, that provides us with the biggest benefit, and then as a side effect, but I guess you could say, like some, in some sense, as a side effect, it\u2019s also creating a lot of positive externality for others, right? And, right, so like, my point is that it\u2019s really important, like, we can operate based on whom we feel like, this is good, let\u2019s do that. Or let\u2019s also say the word over here and over there, like, that simply doesn\u2019t work, right? I mean, not even if it\u2019s like, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re some guy trying to fight climate change, and you\u2019re just like, out, you know, people, you know, people have been trying that for decades, right? And we\u2019ve been sort of chaining themselves to trees or whatever; it doesn\u2019t do anything, right? Because it\u2019s an, it\u2019s a systemic as an economic problem, and you have to fix it with economics and so on. But anyway, this is to answer the question, like climate change isn\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s isn\u2019t of capitalism as a problem, in a sense, and like the way the system works, and so all of its, so there\u2019s both climate change. Still, there\u2019s also deforestation and ecosystem collapse and social, I mean, in particular, so social. What do you call that like decorative decline, basically, right? All of these things are actually all connected to sort of economic systems that just that that mass-produced negative externalities and don\u2019t think that are, you know, aren\u2019t able to consider in the long run? And, and, and what I think is sort of the magic to some extent the Maker can bring to the table is that it\u2019s, it\u2019s a global currency, right? And a currency is this, like, extremely, like, he could think of it as like an extremely powerful coordination tool, right? It\u2019s used as a coordination tool when it comes to, like, pricing stuff, right? And like the way prices, they sort of determining how an economy makes decisions, right. But it can also be a coordination tool around like, not only how you price things, but then also how you sort of back the currency itself and how you allocate credit, and how am I like that\u2019s sort of the other piece of of the of money as a coordination tool? That\u2019s not, you know, it\u2019s like it hasn\u2019t ever, like, it\u2019s not been explored much beyond, you know, some conversations around like central banks buying social bonds or something. But money is like the perfect like; it\u2019s the one tool that sort of is systemic, or has the potential to be a systemic tool that can provide, you know, systemic solutions because it\u2019s just so crazy scalable, right? And that\u2019s one part of it that, and that\u2019s where it\u2019s so that\u2019s where, number one, how do we like one of the like, one of the most obvious benefits that that Mayor can get from, from just doing good creating positive, like basically funding positive externalities, right? One of the ways it can capture some of the value of that positive externality is through branding. And I think that\u2019s where it\u2019s at. That\u2019s a really obvious place where, why it makes sense to focus on climate change and like clean money if the brand had the focus be on Climate change, and that\u2019s because climate like there is all these things going wrong at once. Still, climate change is the biggest one, and the one everyone\u2019s talking about, like, that\u2019s the one that\u2019s been talking about the most, right? So so that\u2019s you know, and it\u2019s important like this is only going to work if we\u2019re able to tap into that kind of the so the vibe, the virality essentially off and then the sort of the communication aspect of this right, that we can create clean money that produces positive externalities. And if enough people like, if there\u2019s enough momentum behind that, then you can create you can get some critical mass, right, you can get so much liquidity in the currency that it becomes a world currency, and then the whole set of systems have a snaps in place, and you, you know, you get, you get economies of scale and network effects that mean that you do have some of the surplus available to fund all of these positive externalities. So that\u2019s kind of one place to look like, and that\u2019s the main driver behind sustainable collateral, right. So doing things like renewable energy and, maybe even like really sort of fancy ambitious projects, like trying to fund a fusion power or something, like things were kind of you can, you can like show people look, this is what DeFi can do. It\u2019s a coordination tool. That means if you put your money in DeFi, you\u2019re building giant wind turbines, right. You\u2019re sort of; you\u2019re doing that it\u2019s a, it\u2019s kind of a quick computer program that allows individuals to sort of band together and they don\u2019t have to do anything, they just have to hold their money in a different acid. But then by doing that, they\u2019re creating a real, you know, they\u2019re making a real difference in that they can, and they can see that directly, right, they can track it, they can see, look, this is straight on constructing winter mines, right. And that\u2019s kind of that\u2019s something that\u2019s missing right now. Because what you have today you have this, this frustration, almost like humiliation, right? of people like having to like drink from paper straws, which I think is a perfect example of like, we\u2019re sort of doomed, and you know, like, the avalanche is coming to waters. And we\u2019re engaging in these pointless, self-flagellation acts, right? That doesn\u2019t do anything. And it\u2019s like, you know, what, you know, instead of, sort of just accepting it, and then doing some private stuff as sort of an almost like a punishment. You know, we write as we can, we can create a kind of a message of more of a hook, essentially, right? Where it\u2019s like, Look, there\u2019s a real, here\u2019s something real, right? It\u2019s not like a fricking, paper straw that doesn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s, it\u2019s actually about like, providing a push to the financial system itself. Okay, so that\u2019s one big thing. And my point is there, like when it comes to the branding, and we comes to the message, you know, like being clarity and simplicity is crucial. So that\u2019s why like climate change and clean money and sustainable finance, from the climate and co2 pollution angle, I think it needs to be front and center, right? Because it\u2019s something you can explain to people and it\u2019s possible to understand. People understand why solar panels are beneficial to them, why winter mines are beneficial to them, why coal power plants are not good for them, and so on, right? Then there\u2019s this other, this resilience aspect, which is, yeah, so that\u2019s the complete opposite. That\u2019s instead of trying to prevent damage, preventing negative externalities, and caught in creating positive externalities for others. It\u2019s more about like, sort of capturing or like, yeah, like capturing the value or sort of the alphabet, essentially, that\u2019s been created, in a sense, right, by what\u2019s happening right now in terms of pollution, and the trajectory of civilization. And that\u2019s where it\u2019s just like about like, literally, you know, scientific governance, and you really, and it becomes a matter of look, we just need to, to, you know, act based on the data that we have available, right. And what\u2019s happening today is that climate change is this. It\u2019s this it\u2019s a black elephant. So what that means is the financial system sort of could learn about climate alpha and could learn about what\u2019s going to happen. But it\u2019s it doesn\u2019t do it because it\u2019s kind of like the late stage of the 2007 financial crisis where once you go down that rabbit hole, you have to suddenly reprice so much stuff. That is like; the numbers just don\u2019t check, like the math simply doesn\u2019t check out like you just, there\u2019s, there isn\u2019t an answer on what you do if you start to look like considering the science. And that\u2019s basically, and so that\u2019s bad. But, but the opportunity is that Maker can then sort of fill that gap and potentially access assets that are extremely undervalued in terms of other assets that are, you know, that will potentially become, you know, places that will just become desert, for instance, or not being like the real estate, and, you know, in places that will become deserts are not necessarily being priced accordingly, especially compared to places where you know. These places will be the most resilient to climate change. And that\u2019s just like straight-up something that has to be, you know, that that has to be considered fundamentally. But I think what\u2019s kind of the most interesting in terms of again, like how you can create a sort of systemic solution to systemic problems is that if you go like if you assume the ability to grow, and if you assume that I will very large scale through strong branding and strong marketing and so on. You get to a very large scale, then what ends up happening is you start to have a situation where you capture a lot of your positive externality innocence. So that\u2019s another situation where, if you have a lot of agriculture in, let\u2019s say, you know, like, the northern us or something, which is like an area where it\u2019s not clear, what\u2019s going to, you know, it\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s going to be, you know, where the, you know, like, depending on what happens when it comes to emissions reduction, then they\u2019re, you know, they\u2019re these sort of areas where you simply don\u2019t, like you don\u2019t know, whether they\u2019re resilient, you know, whether they are going to make it or not, essentially. And, and, and what\u2019s, but what\u2019s interesting is that you can sort of you can, you can then have, if you have a large enough scale, you can sort of making investments into places that are in the, you know, where you\u2019re sort of you\u2019re not, it\u2019s not clear whether they will, you know, you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t know, exactly, sort of their climate alpha essentially, right, you don\u2019t know, whether other, is this land going to bearable or not. But you can actually have an impact on that uncertainty if you also invest in a sort of producing, you know, producing positive externalities, and producing sustainable energy, right, just like is synergy between, let\u2019s say, whatever agriculture in an area that is vulnerable to climate change. And then sustainable energy, right, that, that prevents climate change from happening. And that\u2019s, you know, so that\u2019s when you can get, you know you can get to a point where you can, you know, you\u2019re able to somewhat sort of overcoming the tragedy of the commons, because you\u2019re able to, in a sense, sort of capture the value. Yeah, like, you\u2019re able to sort of capture the value created by overcoming the tragedy of the commons. And then because you can capture the value, you can then fund sort of fund the efforts in the first place. Yeah, and I mean, then there\u2019s one like that, well, there are many other things you mentioned. But there\u2019s also like this whole political aspect, and that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve been talking about now. And like tax and legal risk and all this stuff, there\u2019s a huge part to it as well, right? But basically, the main thing we are considered a maker is legal risk and UDC Sblacklisting risk. And we know for a fact, I mean, my experience after having dealt with that for four years, right in the context of the fight, is the way politicians and regulators think is literally like, does it look like a bad guy? I\u2019d look like a good guy, right? And if it looks like a bad guy, they\u2019ll much much more likely go after it. It looks like a good guy. They\u2019ll hold off a bit, right? And that\u2019s the thing I like. We\u2019re just, I mean, it\u2019s not like we can break the law or become immune to regulation or something because we\u2019re a bunch of eco-warriors. Right. But it does matter in the big picture of politics. Especially if you create, you know, this is when there\u2019s this whole concept like the super countries, like especially if you combine sort of both political efforts with marketing efforts and sort of adoption efforts, and if you combine all these things, you can really create very powerful sort of security in, in, in countries that are sort of naturally I guess you could say naturally decentralized, basically like, so. So countries that have you know that a democratic strong rule of law these things you can sort of really, you can embed yourself and entrench yourself in that kind of systems. And, and yeah, like, the number one way to do that is to have some way to be relevant and, you know, to sort of creating a kind of a reason why people should care. Right? And, and so it\u2019s not a boils down to it there just you can, you can, like, beat, you know, yeah, right. Like, if DeFi is just about making money and getting rich quick, and so on. It is a, you know, there\u2019s a much greater regulatory risk in that situation than if it\u2019s about, you know, experimenting with cutting-edge technology to figure out how that can help society, right. So yeah, so that\u2019s another big advantage. And, and, and that\u2019s another reason why just, in the end, it\u2019s just it\u2019s like, the profitable way to go. And that\u2019s, and that\u2019s not a bad thing. Like, the fact that going green is profitable is it\u2019s not a bad thing. It\u2019s a fantastic thing, right? Because only if suddenly, the entire planet starts realizing, wow, if we all do this, we make more money, right? That\u2019s the only way it can be solved. So it\u2019s a, it\u2019s really important to create that connection between how do you benefit from providing us with a benefit? But there\u2019s no, there\u2019s no system that can more easily be in that position, and then a currency I think, especially homemakers, it just really sorts of perfect. There\u2019s Okay. I\u2019ll try to. I\u2019ll just ramble a little bit more, and then we\u2019ll, I\u2019ll stop. But you know, so then we\u2019ve, you know, this is the whole question I scale and all the benefits and all this stuff we can do and, you know, climate alpha and Sustainable collateral. And, you know, and then there\u2019s a part of the proposal where this whole thing about tokenomics is what I call unleashing the superpowers of DeFi, right. So really, like, we have all these advantages that we can tap into, but most of them are based around scale, essentially, and based around sort of this future value that could be created if we can just overcome this coordination problem. And then, like, that\u2019s where I\u2019ve tokenomics, and sort of the DeFi sort of black magic that has been invented in DeFi summer in this space, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s a perfect fit for this kind of situation because it\u2019s exactly what we need is this kind of ability to sort of creating, create value and create energy out of nothing based on a future promise of based on attention, essentially, right, that\u2019s, that\u2019s exactly, that\u2019s what you need. To help people sort of driving them in the direction of understanding if we all work together, we all make more money than if we all work against each other, essentially. And tokenomics and, and yeah, like, you know, tokenomics yield following these concepts, they\u2019re ways to sort of, like do that in a very direct economic sense, right, through actual cash flows. So that fits particularly well with a real sort of vision and a real genuine purpose. I believe that\u2019s like the strongest place possible where you can put this kind of, like, aggressive tokenomics. I think I mean, IVs are the best example of like, why strong vision and a real genuine purpose and public good and sort of this excitement and, and sort of, yeah, like vision, I get basically around that, right. Like, why that drives value. Like the perfect day, why is Tesla right, like, which is like, the most valuable company was based basic, you know, had this like, like, the thing that drove it. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re the most valuable anymore, right. But like when they sort of pumped to the most valuable company in the world, it was absolutely because it had this science fiction, you know, like SolarPunk narrative to it, right? And that\u2019s exactly what we can do as well, right? We can use tokenomics, we can use this kind of ratio, and we can use it to just drive this sort of ability to, you know, convincing the world that this is something that can grow and make a difference. It can become huge, And the last tiny thing I want to talk about is sort of the internal is of the last part of the post, right? This is basically how vision, purpose, and ultimately altruism are fundamental for governance and down to even work at all. And so that\u2019s because a doubt doesn\u2019t have regulation or does it doesn\u2019t have authority. So it\u2019s extremely, extremely vulnerable to it\u2019s basically to mean, in the long run, what\u2019s corruption. I mean, in a normal company, the way you deal with corruption, and ultimately is, is through, like shareholder protection, right. And that\u2019s ultimately enforced by the government. And the government ultimately, like it only works because it\u2019s, in some sense, driven by some kind of greater purpose, right? Some kind of altruistic costs, right? Even if the government itself is also corrupt, the thing that\u2019s still preventable, absolutely falling apart, is this sort of shared vision of a nation right. And because a dow doesn\u2019t have a government regulating it, I believe that it needs to have this kind of, sort of, you know, greater good, kind of like shared purpose and shared vision, built into the doubting self for it to function. Because if you don\u2019t have that, if you say, if a dow is entirely about profits, then the problem is then profits and sort of making money is simply not a shared. It\u2019s not a shared vision, right? It\u2019s like an individual thing that everyone makes money. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s great. If everyone comes together and makes money together as a group, while they\u2019re working together, that\u2019s great, that\u2019s going to encourage them to work together. But the problem is, as soon as you present someone with an option to make more money by the sort of defecting, if the only thing is driving them as money, then they\u2019re going to defect. Right? And that perfect example of that is something like voter apathy. Like, why should I pay money to vote or spend time to vote? If I\u2019m not getting anything, right, and, like, because I\u2019m getting the money, no matter what, and I\u2019m here for the money, so why bother doing anything to do that? That\u2019s not going to give me more money, right. And instead, if you if it\u2019s if people are, they\u2019re motivated by the money, but they\u2019re also motivated by something beyond that, then you kind of you get, you know, then it\u2019s like, what\u2019s the reason why someone should go in and vote, even though it doesn\u2019t directly benefit them? Well, that\u2019s because of the whole, you know, the way they benefit is because the whole thing, has this greater purpose that aligns with their sort of vision of, of the world, right. Then you can begin to; you can sort of draw out this, this motivation from within people to just, you know, be sort of the, you know, contribute, like, contribute to the greater good in the Dow, because the Dow contributes to sort of the greater good in the world. So, you know, you\u2019re, nobody wants to be the sucker that, like, volunteers that time to help make a bunch of other people rich, right? Like, that\u2019s, that\u2019s very demotivating. So if it said that there needs to be something beyond that, and I think that\u2019s, that\u2019s completely critical and, and then there\u2019s the whole piece of like, the, the core units and sort of the bureaucracy that exists around governance, which is completely unique, and unlike anything else, anywhere in crypto, and it, it needs a kind of, you know, like it\u2019s, it\u2019s guaranteed that if it if it doesn\u2019t have some kind of very strong kind of, I call like an immune response, kind of like something that really sort of tries to almost like, I guess, keep it clean, essentially, then it\u2019s guaranteed then we have some kind of like a big bulky bureaucracy and in a doubt, overtime, that\u2019s gonna absolutely corrupt and, but the problem is, again, like, if you have a bunch of people that are working for the Dow, and they\u2019re working class off, and they\u2019re, you know, they\u2019re like, in all this chaos and complexity and uncertainty, and then you come and impose a bunch of bureaucratic requirements on them and, and sort of treat them as you know, you don\u2019t even like, you don\u2019t even trust them, right, but and you\u2019re, you\u2019re putting a bunch of bureaucracy on them, and you\u2019re sort of creating a system that assumes they\u2019re hostile, and would you ultimately have to do in a bankruptcy that has the potential to become corrupt, right, but if all of that is happening, and the entire context for that is just so people can make money, then, you know, then people either I mean, either they\u2019re going to need huge amounts of just crazy high compensation, or they\u2019re going to go corrupt and they\u2019re going to get their money that way, or they\u2019re just going to quit and not bother dealing with it right. And the only way that this is like that, realistically, you can make sense and make people dedicate their time and energy to this right. So if again, there\u2019s some kind of motivation beyond just being about money. All right, well, I don\u2019t know how I was probably a half-hour, I think. I think that\u2019s good enough for now.   Questions 45:25  Planet_X: How many details around this proposal have you worked out yet?  Rune Christensen: I have very specific ideas around how to do a lot of the stuff I\u2019m talking about. But in the end, that\u2019s not really like this, you know, that doesn\u2019t necessarily matter that much. My goal is that the outcome of doing all these things should be that, in particular, I and anyone else can just pull outright and not be relied on. I want to do very much to work collaboratively with the governance community, particularly MKR holders and sort of the people that represent MKR holders. To figure out what is the governance perspective on and how to do different things.    48:51  Planet_X: Can your proposal be considered a complete package, or is it possible to perhaps split it up into several sections and do a little bit at a time?  Rune Christensen: Yes. So Wouter advocates that we figure out some principles that we agree on to create clarity, mainly for the core units. From my perspective, I didn\u2019t think we needed to agree on this vision at all because it\u2019s just my opinion. Even if the DAO makes clean money and all of it, it will be its own thing; it will be an interpretation or an evolution of what I initially suggested, which I can also contribute to. There is a logical sort of circularity to it where you can\u2019t do. Let\u2019s say something like a Tokenomics overhaul; we could do that with no other context at all. And that\u2019s something where you could sort of treat that as, like, its own thing but the question is, if it\u2019s, you know, it might be, you know, tokenomics is all about narrative and in mind, you know, and this is a nom just sort of thinking about, how these samples of like how things sort of fit together, right, and it may not be a great may not necessarily be a good thing to suddenly pivot on your tokenomics if there isn\u2019t some kind of broader narrative to it, because possibly you sort of, you\u2019re saying, Oh, we have, we had bad tokenomics, and now we\u2019re trying random stuff to see if we can save ourselves. Right?    51:09  Planet_X: Yes. My argument here is that this proposal contains quite a lot of stuff. An overall implementation plan would not hurt. What do we do first? In what order? And, you know, especially regarding regulation, and add the strategy around any tokenomics overhaul? I mean, it\u2019s quite a significant amount of work, each one of these, these items. We\u2019ll get there.  Rune Christensen: Yes, I don\u2019t think that any of the stuff that really can be done. In the short run, we could agree on principles, like a real attempt, to brand ourselves as clean money. I think the reason why that\u2019s happening, I believe, is because it\u2019s useful to the media, kind of like it\u2019s useful to some elements in the crypto media because what they\u2019re using it for is they\u2019re trying to push back against this mainstream media narrative of Bitcoin is bad for the environment, and so on. It\u2019s possible that because the media is already running with it, that we may, you know, we may be able to just say, Oh, yeah, we, you know, we clean money now, we haven\u2019t done anything yet. However, we\u2019re planning to, and then we can just still actually brand ourselves that way. And to do something on that, we will certainly need some kind of vote for something like that, for instance, right. And that could be like a set of simple principles. And then what that just does is okay, now there\u2019s agreement about like, our values and our brand and this kind of thing that will inform things like what core units are doing, but may also even what individual down members are doing. And what someone like me is doing, when I\u2019m out there promoting, you know, podcasts or whatever talking about the project. I think in all cases, it\u2019s like a year away before we\u2019ll be like that; what I suggested in the post is the most obvious when we could get is taking a huge amount of USDC exposure and put it into ESG bonds outside of the US in a trust structure, because, like, and that\u2019s sort of very specific to a bunch of different things like including, the big problem is that USGS bonds just aren\u2019t the greatest thing in the world like they\u2019re kind of like ESG is sort of the reincarnation of corporate social responsibility to some extent. But less fraudulent, essentially but it\u2019s still good, it has sort of a sense of trust and, I think being able to move billions into ESG assets would just like there is a mind-blowing powerful thing that I don\u2019t think that that, you know, something similar has happened to DeFi, basically and there will be a huge deal.    55:13  Wouter: I want to explain why it\u2019s important that we reconfirm support and consensus for a few key principles. I think that we\u2019re making a pivot, right. And the perception of what Maker is about is, is changing. And once again, it\u2019s not the first time we started with real-world assets as a focus. When we added USDC, Maker\u2019s perception has changed, and many people still haven\u2019t; they haven\u2019t gotten over it right. And I think one unfortunate thing that happened when we switched to the real-world assets as a focus is that first, in a sense, Maker became more of a project that didn\u2019t belong anywhere, right? We weren\u2019t as popular anymore with the ETH purists. And yeah, we, we couldn\u2019t like nail down the real-world assets narrative strong enough to immediately create enough interest. And I don\u2019t want to downplay the monumental milestones we\u2019ve reached in red. The point is, we fell in between two shared chairs. And people had a hard time wrapping their heads around, like, what is make you\u2019re supposed to be now? Is it just the USBC wrapper? The real acid stuff, like what is it all about? So definitely know that we\u2019re a Dao. One, one, we are going through another change in the perception about what Maker is about. The reality is that people will have to choose sides, right? Like, some people will be out; if you think that it\u2019s a complete strategic disastrous mistake to tie makers to fighting climate change, then maybe you want to quit. And, on the other hand, other people will want to join because wire Maker maybe was not meaningful to them before now, it might be meaningful, and we can open the doors to new partnerships, new alliances, and so on. To get that right, we have to send a strong signal that this, not leave this hanging up in the air, this is still a proposal, we are still working out the details, we don\u2019t know yet exactly what it will look like, but we send a very strong signal that these are the core principles that we\u2019re going for, in a way it is a pivot. This is what Maker is about now, and this is the direction we\u2019re going. And this is the claim the kind of clarity; it doesn\u2019t mean that we have to agree on the details; it just means that we create clarity around the new direction of the project. And then we should be able to do that fast and decisively. And then you have a clean environment where you can start working out the details, once we\u2019ve all agreed that you know, these, this is the long term direction we\u2019re going in. And I think that it is incredibly important to make sure that we can effectively deliver. Otherwise, there\u2019s going to be a lot of uncertainty, and people will be confused, and there\u2019s going to be a lot of confusion again around what Maker is about. And I think that could be quite bad.  59:52  Nik Kunkel: Two things are going on here. Firstly, does the community holistically share this vision that Wouter has presented? Secondly, what does this vision entail? We need to map out the tangible steps, like an imaginary roadmap, of what DAO can do immediately and what can be done after a year. It will be hard for the community to evaluate one without the other, and the second piece is missing at the moment.  Wouter: That is where I slightly disagree. It will take too much time for us to agree upon a roadmap of, for example, 20 milestones. As it takes us forever to decide on those 20 milestones, uncertainty will result in the organization not knowing what to do. This will contribute to confusion over Maker\u2019s identity and perception of the core of the project. By laying that foundation and agreeing on several key principles, we recognize that we do not have the specifics yet. However, these are the principles that we want to share and gather around as we work out a roadmap that goes in the direction of those principles. This will create a context to a point where we can productively and constructively work on actual deliverables. Then, we need to start looking into our short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals. Sending the strong signal first would be a good step because it will create a lot of clarity. I posted my list of candidates in the chat. The sentiment seems very positive. We all concur with the clean money principle but let us confirm that with a vote. For the MKR holders that do not agree with it or just waiting to see if it would pass, let us give them a reality check and not just leave them hanging. For those wanting to join because of this new principle, let us allow them to join for it. My suggestion of the five principles with the clean money principle will have us reconfirm with turning Maker into a force against climate change. We can reconfirm that we want to continue with decentralization through diversification. On the one hand, this means doubling down on the real-world assets, collateral strategy, decentralizing it further, onboarding green collateral types, and so on. On the other hand, it would also reconfirm our commitment to crypto collateral and hopefully refresh our alliances in the Ethereum ecosystem. Lastly, this proposal chooses growth over conservatism by, for example, reducing spending to ensure that we remain profitable in the short run and learn MKR. The last one is a very important one that some people may disagree with. But as I said, sending that signal, or at least verifying that we have support to do so, will be a reality check for people. Those who disagree should probably go their own way. Those who do agree are very welcome to join. Within that framework, as a matter to start thinking about, what would the milestones be? How do we organize as the governance framework to them to get these pieces in place? This would just be a good direction to take.    1:05:42  Rune Christensen: One thing to add is that the perfect way to do this would be to replace the old foundation principles that almost everyone forgot. But in a sense, you can create it; it could be a choice between basically sticking with the old principles or switching to a new set by upgrading them. The original framework even includes the possibility that it will be changed in the future like others.  1:06:21  David Utrobin: Also, this comes against many conversations in the last six months to a year about MakerDAO\u2019s brand direction being loose and undefined. Who sets it? How do we determine it? This proposal is coming with that as a backdrop, so treating this will also affect our brand. How we refresh or redesign those principles will affect Maker\u2019s optics and how we look like an organization to the world. Keep that in mind as well.  1:07:02   LongForWisdom: My memory is a little foggy, but I seem to remember that the original foundation principles were each around a page long. Yes, there were five, and were they each about a paragraph long? Is someone volunteering to write these up as a new set of principles, or are we going to go with sentences?  David Utrobin: The first ones were easy because it was the foundation. It was obvious for the person or entity to propose those. But now that we have a bunch of decentralized core units, I am not sure. I am happy to partner with anybody who feels particularly driven to rewrite and refresh these. I am happy to support my team.    1:08:00  LongForWisdom: We may do this soon, but that is a choice. It may look bad if we ruin the founder of MakerDao based on this thinking. Do we want to consider the decentralized aspects and the possibility of following our voting to governance process rather than doing something special?  Wouter: I would not follow a special governance process.    1:08:40  LongForWisdom: Well, doing it quickly is a problem because its process would normally take a month of RFC time, correct? And then it is on the air ??? for two weeks? So that is six weeks? This does not sound like your definition of soon.  Wouter: Is there another procedure that we have in place to do this? LongForWisdom: There is the weekly process, but the polls are up for about three days. Is that long enough to vote on something that is a massive change of direction? I would argue no, and they would like to show us that. Wouter: We can stack it a bit. You can start with a simple forum poll or a signal request, which would set the tone. Then the final confirmation would come later, and I do not think that is an issue. The point is to start as soon as possible to have the question on the table. LongForWisdom: So, we are thinking of expressing broad support for this proposal early on and then clarifying exactly what that will look like later. Thanks.    1:10:01  Rune Christensen: We must follow the plan. If we replace the foundation principles, we must absolutely and completely follow the process. I have noticed numerous posts from people saying they are out, which has yet to be addressed. There needs to be an attempt to quantify who is presently against us, so the opposition is heard. If we decide with the community to move on, it is important to ensure that the silent majority is not neglected. In addition, it cannot just be Rune writing wall texts, and then everyone approves. In the beginning, I did not talk about or consider the principles that we are talking about now. However, there must be some type of processing within the DAO. Instead of just me coming up with the wall texts, these ideas must inspire others to come up with their ideas. Resultingly, if everyone then comes up with logic that seemingly aligns, something powerful is created. This creates the potential to align and sync the community around us. We need to tap into this power.  LongForWisdom: Yes, give it some thought over the next few days on how to do this quickly and properly.    1:13:33  Prose11: I appreciate you sharing further and everyone who has contributed to the conversation today. Looking at the time, I am aware we are getting towards the end of the meeting. If you have other thoughts on that subject, now would be a good time to speak up. I imagine this will be as long as they can have an ongoing process as we figure out ways to submit these questions through our governments. For the moment, this is the last chance to say anything about it on this call.  1:13:33  David Utrobin: While people think of their comments and last thoughts, I would like to plug that our summary team that creates snippets, transcribes summaries, editorial summaries, and public calls are looking for people to join. We are looking for writers; we are looking for people to do quality assurance work. It is part-time, and it is paid. Reach out to Artem or me if anyone you know is interested in getting their foot in the door at MakerDao.  1:14:01  Nadia Alvarez: I want to add something in favor of Rune\u2019s proposal. I also like the priority change in Maker\u2019s vision. We did amazing things with our first ideas about banking and the unbanked. We have seen amazing outcomes with placing decentralized stablecoins in economically unstable countries like Argentina and Venezuela. Instead of just talking about it, we were the first ones to act in helping these countries. Consequently, we improved the living circumstances of their people. If you go to Argentina, people are saving in the currency DIA. I experienced how different stablecoins, DeFi protocols, and crypto projects were paying more attention to creating solutions to problems. With our new proposed objectives, we can make a difference in the financial aspect and climate change. Moving forward with this objective will be a great first step for others to follow.  1:16:10  Rune Christensen: I just want to add one thing. We cannot forget financial inclusion. The brand needs to have that clarity. A big problem with the original founding principles was that they talked about both sustainability and financial inclusion. It would be a huge mistake to somehow drop the ball on the winds we have already created and the potential that still exists. The argument could be made that as climate change controls future actions, the world will focus on financial inclusion when it can use finance to protect its people from the outcomes of climate change. That might be one of the best ways to follow that principle. We must not turn our backs on our incredible success in Argentina in addition to its existing potential. The worst perception would be that we tried and failed because that certainly is not the case. Furthermore, when we get things like L2, we can get back in the game. There will be a whole new universe of financial inclusion in dealing with the last mile, even as a DAO and so on. What we can achieve in a systemic push for climate action is a factor everyone needs to consider.  1:18:35  Prose11: I appreciate the reflections there. Anyone else looking to add to the competition?  David Utrobin: MakerDao has great potential to do a ton of good in the world.   Prose11: Awesome. I appreciate everyone for coming and participating. As always, the discussions will continue in the form and RocketChat. Thanks, everyone, for coming. Appreciate the discussion.

Other options discussed are using Slack, creating another Rocket.chat, and etc. Trying to decentralize it as much as possible with a few admins in charge of backup files. Figuring out which handles are most appropriate for CUs and topics.  If anyone has any ideas or personal preferences, reach out to Long or Seth. Long will publish a post on this sometime next week.   Looking to create NFTs to distribute to everyone who has participated in Rocket.chat.  Organizing Permissions:  There is a potential verification method through Metamask and MKR tokens.  This comes with issues for non-MKR holders.   Another method is to set up DAO-member roles with familiar faces. Easier to moderate specific channels rather than the entire Discord account.   L2 Updates and Plans  Protocol Engineering  Current work on L2 makes sure that we get Dai on Arbitrum, which has publically launched over two weeks ago.  So far has attracted 5 billion of capital. Roll-ups are cheaper and as safe as Ethereum; therefore, they are very efficient.   Goal is to bridge Dai in a way where we can mint Dai and have it fungible with bridged Dai. Should see Dai on Arbitrum next week!  In the final testing phases.   Implementing Dai Fast Withdrawal Bridge (FWB) is more complicated.  Working with the Oracle Core Unit. Will be the only FWB that isn\u2019t constrained by liquidity.   Setting up discussion around Starkware support regarding ZK Rollup.  Goal is to launch by the EOY.   Working with various teams on bridges  Working with HOP Protocol.     Presentation  Voting Portal Updates  DUX Team  Team Mission: enabling the best-in-class decentralized decision-making for the maker protocol by providing meaningful UX for all gov participants. Will have a podcast call going over the team vision on September 22nd.  Demo:  Main feature is Delegate statistics. Sorting order is currently randomized.  Something we will look into.   Provides participation and communication scores by GovAlpha. Shows their supporting executives and entire vote history. Delegates can provide their bio, stats, and additional info. Each poll contains a discussion link. Delegate contracts expire after one year; this information is now shown. Now offers a visualization of the vote breakdown:  Who votes What they vote on MKR amount voted % of voting power   Also offers more macro graphics showing the size of everyone\u2019s voting power. Every address contains a profile page.  Offers polling history plus more.   Also contains small UI and optimization features.  Future Work:  Details on where MKR comes from (cold wallet, etc.)  Provide a breakdown for voting weight through etherscan. Provide more overall context.   Want to add the Delegate\u2019s voting weight over time. Poll comparison compatibility page between addresses.\u200b  ",

We are working on figuring out migration from RocketChat to Discord. The general sentiments seem to be in favor of Discord. We have other options that have been discussed, and they include KeyBase, creating a new RocketChat, even using Slack or other tools like Matrix and Workstorm. Most people have Discord handles and are used to interacting with Discord, which seems to be the general favorite at the moment, but there have been valid concerns raised about difficulties around moderating discord servers and preserving the culture that we have cultivated in RocketChat so far. The plan right now is that TechOps will handle the setup, implementation, administration, and moderation will be somewhat decentralized much as possible. Discord lets admins create backups of discord servers as long as we have a few admins who can maintain those backups, and I think that addresses any concerns around decentralization. We are still working on which channels we think are the most appropriate. We covered most of the obvious ones you would guess so far, you know, general random channels, specifically for core units, both public and private, but if anyone has private chat channels that they would like to see, please reach us. GovComms has volunteered to help collect Discord handles. We like to try and get as many people invited so that we can make the transition as smooth as possible. We are looking into creating some NFTs to distribute to everyone coming over who has participated in RocketChat previously. We are talking with Pope about distributing those. Comments, questions, concerns, or anybody strongly opposed to using Discord, please feel free to raise your hand.   Questions  Q: We need to research how to deal with bots and scammers. I am not sure if there is any other software or techniques, but others have raised that in the past.  A: It is something we are aware of. I have started using Discord for Crypto a few months ago, so I have been thinking around all the other channels and stuff. Seem to be a sort of fairly standard mechanism to s=prevent access to channels like gated with captures and stuff, hoping that will keep most of the bots out of the channels.   Mario (chat): If we have considered other options like Matrix, and it is on the list we have considered, I like it as a backup platform.  A: Many people like the idea of Discord, like the primary platform, because lots of other people are there, generally accessible to everyone, and people are familiar with it. Matrix is much more decentralized than Discord, and it does not have a centralized operator, and it would be good to have a backup that is more decentralized in case something happens with Discord.   Q: I assume there is a programmable API for Discord; I have only never used it as a user, but if there are concerns about bots, I assume that we will be able to implement things like chat OPS where we get alerts and whatnot from either let\u2019s say the forums or from stuff we check on-chain or whatever and maybe even we can take actions from the chat channels.  A: Not sure if anyone has built any blockchain compatible bots, so that would be interesting.   Q: What is the time frame or next steps? When do you think we will have the Discord channel enabled? What are the plans to integrate? Other CoreUnits have their servers, and are we planning to integrate, or will they be independent?  A: We are working on the channel and permissions as roles are set up. That will take a few weeks to take off, set it up and get it going. We hope to start migrating people two weeks before RocketChat shuts down to have a nice buffer in case anything goes wrong or we have issues. I will make a forum post with details of the channel and role setup we have in mind for comment before we do it. In terms of the core unit question, one of the things we will do is provide channels for all core units in the main Discords like there will be public versions. There will be public versions and private versions. There are some questions about whether we could bridge the public ones to other discords if the core units have their own, which I think is doable.   Q: I know we are exploring some of the role attributes and permissions facing a few challenges there. I do not know if it is worth bringing up, but I am curious if we have thoughts on how we will be organizing permissions within the channels. I saw the pleaser DAO, the DOG, NFT, whatever token DOG. You could get verified by connecting your Metamask wallet to the Discord channel; all you have to prove is that you own dog tokens, and your username changes colors. That is something that we might be able to do.  A: That is an option. We want to be careful as to what our goals are when we do that to prevent spam. I think there are better ways to do that. I think we are already planning to have a role for people who have been in the DAO for some time. There will be a DAO member role that contains all the delegates, all the Core members, all the regular and familiar faces. We could also have that based on MKR, but I think using the token setup as an antispam thing may be bad because you will have some subset people that just do not want to think like Metamouse to Discord in any way. Some people do not own MKR but have valid things to contribute to the conversation or forum. Having antispam would be bad in terms of \u201chey, this person owns some Mkr.\u201d There are stakeholders in our ecosystem that might not be Mkr holders that we should let in our communication channels. I do not agree with the whole Mkr chat channel for everything, and it may be as a dedicated chat channel like Long was saying, but I am not sure what the benefit is.   Q: It was displayed the way that we have badges in the forum. I think it would be cool just as an extra - this person is verified. The main challenge is that we want to assign people to be moderated to specific channels rather than just moderating the entire Discord and figuring out the system. Discord only lets you assign mode permissions by roles; there is a little bit of weirdness about creating a hierarchy that lets people moderate specific channels but not others. Q: Has anyone thought about the jurisdiction where the main server would be hosted, subpoena compliance, that sort of thing, log retention? That is the thing with Discord; you do not manage any of the server stuff yourself; it is just hosted like Discord.  A: This is one of the reasons I want the decentralized backup.   We have to discuss the potential of liability that admins and admins might be taking on and if there is a way to, I believe Long found there is a way to designate the server owner. We are figuring out how to delegate the Dai foundation, which would certainly be preferable.  I think we needed a foundation-owned account to create a server and assign the first tech Ops guy as an admin, and then we should be fine.   Maybe write down on Discord and migration, as I said. I will post on the forum with a breakdown of the proposed channel setup and roll set up for comments by the end of next week.   L2 Updates and Plans  Protocol Engineering  Bartek Kiepuszewski 25:20  The current work on L2 is making sure that we get Dai on Arbitrum as soon as possible. You might have seen the post in the forum: where Arbitrum Launch opened up to the public around two weeks ago. Last week we saw some farms opening up. It attracted an avalanche of capital flowing in. The last I checked, it was around 2.5 billion. It points to our thesis that we might end up in a world where much collateral flows into these roll-ups sooner than we think. People will want to do stuff on the roll-ups and live because they are cheaper and safe than Ethereum. We have been trying to work for our Bridge Dai Team to bridge Dai. We want to do it so that it will be possible to mint Dai directly on L2 in the future. That minted Dai will be fungible with the Dai that we bridge. That requires a custom gateway. To do that, we spent a lot of time with the teams, at first with Optimism and now with Arbitrum, to convince them that this is the right approach and to implement it. It does take some time. However, I am happy to say that we will hopefully see Dai on Arbitrum next week. We are close to having that work done. We are at the final phases of testing. The next logical step for us for both Optimistic roll-ups, Optimism, and Arbitrum, is to start implementing the Fast Withdrawl Bridge (FWB). This is a little bit more complicated. We are doing this together with the Oracle Core Unit because we need their support to make it happen. Once that is done, we will have the only FWB that is not liquidity-constrained. If you are interested in how it works, I have published with Derek a post in the forum about this a few months ago. This is the exact design that will be used, and given that there is so much capital right now in Arbitrum and possibly very soon in Optimism, we think it will allow the Protocol to provide some liquidity for all these liquidity flows. We are super excited about that. The third thing that we are doing right now is to help the discussion around the Starkware Net Support. It is another roll-up that has not been launched yet, but it is much more complicated. It is a ZK Rollup. When it launches by the end of the year, we want to make sure that we are ready, especially from the engineering point of view. We need to understand this and do more or less the same things that we are doing for the Optimistic roll-ups. To this end, there is a small CU that will focus exactly on this. They have a very small mandate to research and implement the same bridge we have done for Optimistic roll-ups but on the ZK Rollup. We have also been working with teams doing bridges, like HOP Protocol. We want to explore with the HOP Protocol can use Dai liquidity. Right now, this is one of the only ways to move your funds quickly from roll-up to roll-up. You can also use Connext or use a Celer Bridge, but all of them require liquidity. Every Protocol will be liquidity-constrained, and we can try to provide this liquidity as a short-term loan. These are probably the main four workstreams that are keeping us busy.   Questions 30:27  David Utrobin: There are all of these L2s coming to an end, and I know that not all of them will gain their fair share or expected market share. How do you weigh or decide between the priorities of the different L2s that you are working on? For things that are not in existence yet, like Starkware. What other information gives you enough conviction to go after the huge undertaking of building with Starkware?  A: It is a judgment to be done on which team and roll-up will be potentially the most successful in the future. You want to place your bets wisely. The main criterium is the risk factor. We are helping how to educate the whole community about the risk. We want to ensure that the Dai you put on the roll-up and take it back is as safe as on L1. That is why we are excited about the roll-ups. With our bridge, and for other chains, like Polygon and Avalanche, we think that the current approach of the Growth Team and other teams, which is to simply use their bridges and wrap Dai into a wrapped Token, is workable. We might change our approach in the future, but that should work fine. We think that with the security of the roll-up and the quality of the team comes the conviction that this roll-up is safe and people can do stuff on it safely. This is what we saw on Arbitrum. A less accomplished team could not have pulled it off. We follow the quality of the roll-up, the reputation of the team, but also liquidity. We have to chase liquidity, which is the major factor. The two combined give us a good picture. This is why we helped to create L2Beat to track both liquidity and risk. Arbitrum and Optimism are probably the leaders right now in the Optimistic roll-ups. With ZK roll-ups, the Starkware is a matter lapse with ZK Sync and Aztec. These three are top-notch teams that are leading the pack.   Q: I hear you talking about L2s, and I know people are focusing on this for many different reasons. I do not necessarily see sidechains going away, and they can complement the entire ecosystem. We can debate this security, etc., and I do not think this technology, this Starkware Net applies. Is there a way to be the Dai Bridge from L1 into the sidechains to provide the base-level Dai security and cross-bridge between the sidechains?. Make Dai ubiquitous, in and through, in some ways we could capitalize on the side chain aspect? I wonder if this is applicable.  A: This is an important consideration for us. Sidechains are not being equal. The main problem that we have now is that the sidechains break the whole security framework of Dai, which is minted on Ethereum. If we think about minting Dai on other chains and that Dai has a very different risk, it may be a different token. Being able to mint Dai on the sidechain says that this Dai is riskier than Dai minted on Ethereum. Because apart from the usual risks like the collateral and whatnot, it will have some additional risks related to how this sidechain is secured and how this bridge is secured. It is possible to mint Dai on sidechains. However, we need to develop the Sharded Vault Engine, a complex core system design that will contain this risk and create a local DC for a sidechain. It is possible. We are not ready yet. We assumed that for sidechains, we accepted that people would be wrapping the Dai, which is minted on L1. Our approach is to mint Dai on L1 and rapidly move it to the sidechain to use it. If you wanted to mint Dai on L2 and still want Dai to be the same, meaning fungible, suddenly you would have to manage the risk of Dai minted on the sidechain to be less secure. We are thinking about it. If you look at the multichain strategy forum post, but it is hard. Think about a simple use case: you go, for example, to Polygon, you mint hundreds of millions of Dai, and you want to set bridges back to L1. Where does this Dai on L1 come from? The one that you have to mint so you can bridge it to L1. You need to be able to solve this problem first. That is the mental model that we have got. Think about going to a sidechain minting a ton of Dai there and immediately bridge it to L1. That is the scenario we have in mind when we think that Dai should be fungible. Otherwise, it is just a different Dai. There is Dai on Ethereum; there is Dai on Solana. It is a different Dai, a different Token.   LongForWisdom: Are you prioritizing the L2s versus the side chains?  A: First of all, L2s are more secure. Secondly, we do not have to think about the bridge because it is completely permissionless for the roll-ups. We are prioritizing the fast withdrawals, which can be done only on the roll-ups, which we are trying to do. This Sharded Vault Engine depends on the community and how we prioritize that. It is a complex design, a lot of work. Maybe there are some other priorities that we have to take care of first.   Q: We at the DUX Team have been thinking about ways to improve the Governance experience. One thought is reducing the cost of voting and participation in Governance. How could we leverage L2s for Governance?  A: We have not been thinking about it. Right now, our primary concern is to make Dai available, but I see no reason why we should not think about it. If you have got the EVM-compliant L2, it would be easy to have a much cheaper voting system. Optimistic and ZK roll-ups can be used to this end. You should give it a try, and if you need any guidance from us, we are ready to help. Arbitrum and Optimism roll-ups are ready to do it, and ZK roll-ups as well. It should not be hard. Maybe a year ago or a bit longer, in the Foundation, we had several sessions with the Starkware Team on pushing voting off to Starkware. Voting was getting expensive, and we thought it would help participation. There is a design on how to do that, but part of that design was leaning on DSS-Gov as having the newer Governance Module for that to work. It became a use case of delegation. Maybe we can shoehorn the delegation we have together with the old design, and it might work.   Q: Do we prefer to mint Dai on L2 or vote on L2 first? Is it our goal to have the inclusion of Dai, which we could do with bridges? To me, the voting aspect may have as much value on L2 and having inclusion of other MKR holders as the ability to mint Dai on an L2.  A: The version of the delegation that we pushed mitigates some of the voting concerns that we were having regarding participation in gas. We bought ourselves a little time to recapture the users who could mint a 20 Dai Vault or 100 Vault by moving over L2s. Because the dust limits there would be so much lower, it is a higher priority for us to do the Sharded Vault Engine or move MCD and deploy it to Optimism and Arbitrum instead of solving this voting issue. We already have mitigation.   Frank Cruz: The recent issue with the outage on Arbitrum was because there was a large burst of transactions in a short period. Is that something we can expect? In Optimism? How long before? Is that something that will improve over time, or do you expect more development to happen before we can get 400000 transactions per second?  A: You take these 400 000 transactions per second from the Solana crash. It was the number of transactions in the mempool, not the ones processed by Solana. There was a misunderstanding here. What happened for Arbitrum was not as serious as people think because it was just the Sequencer that was overwhelmed. The roll-up itself was chugging along correctly. All the contracts on L1 and all the funds were safe, and if people were desperate, they could push their transactions through because there is a backdoor on that contract that allows them to do so. This backdoor was created because the Sequencer may censor some users, or it may go down for some time like it happened yesterday. The good thing is that the roll-up did not stop. That is the beauty of the design. The Sequencer is to helps with the UX and makes sure that everything is faster for the end-user. However, the roll-up security is implemented inside Ethereum smart contracts. It is upgradable, and it has got training wheels. You can always overlend Sequencer. It is a centralized service. They have to harden it to make it stronger, and they will be able to do so with time. Because it is centralized, they can make it much harder. Even though Sequencer is centralized, the funds are safe, and they can not do anything to steal them or whatever. That is the whole idea about roll-ups. I cannot tell you if such an outage will not happen again. It is possible, and it is not up to us. It does not change our perspective on the risk. It would be much worse if the sidechain went down, then we would not know what to do. Roll-ups right now it is sharding. It is horizontal scaling and not vertical. We might expect to have many different roll-ups, and this is how they are going to scale. The traffic will be spread out between roll-ups, so people playing games might have their roll-up, people collecting FTs they might have their roll-up, and DeFi might end up on one of the roll-ups. You will not see such huge spikes in gas fees because there is another NFT drop.     Presentation  Voting Portal Updates  DUX Team 47:38  Intro1920\u00d71131 127 KB   I will give a quick demo of some of the features that we have been working on. I am Phil Bain, the facilitator for the DUX CU. Before that, I was a foundation member, and I was a developer for two years, working on many of the front-end projects.   TeamMission1920\u00d71126 157 KB   We recently split off and formed a team which is the DUX Core Unit. We are focused entirely on Governance and Governance UX. Whereas before, the foundation had a front-end team that was responsible for a lot of different applications. We can focus on a single domain and devote our resources to creating the best governance experience possible. Next week we will be doing a launch pod call to introduce the team and the team mission and vision. For now, we will stick to some of the features that we have been working on for the past few months since we started.   TeamMembers1917\u00d71127 158 KB   I want to give a big shout-out to our team. We got a lot of talented people here. Four developers: Tyler, Adam Rafael, and myself. We have a designer Tiago and a Product Manager Deniz. Deniz joined us recently, and we are excited to have him.   Contact1920\u00d71130 141 KB   You have our contact information, and we want to hear from you. We have been doing interviews with some delegates, and we want to get a sense of how you are using the Portal, what can be improved, and where we can go from there. Please join our Discord or drop some ideas on our Idea Board. I will post these chat links on the chat later.

There is an ability in the UI to set up a delegated contract to become a shadow delegate. To become a recognized delegate, we have people that apply and agree to the code of conduct that GovAlpha has put forth. Recognized delegates get priority viewing in the UI, and they get more details. We have a list of delegates. One thing to note is we do not play favorites. Anytime you visit the page, the sorting order gets randomized. That way, there is not always the same person at the top who gets all the delegated MKR because people are too lazy to go to the next one. When you look at these cards, we have been trying to display much important information for the users. You can see how much MKR was delegated to a particular delegate, how much is delegated by you, the participation score, and the communication score. GovAlpha provides these scores. We pull in their data into the UI and present that on the card here. Another nice feature of the card is that you can see what executive they are currently supporting. You can go through and check to make sure all the delegates are doing their duty, and they are up to date on the latest executives. That goes for all the delegates. You can also see how much MKR is delegated to shadow delegates, what they are supporting, and so on.

The delegates can all provide bio credentials, which is the benefit of being a recognized delegate. You can provide some external links. We have stats at the bottom to give an overview of the information about this delegate. Along the top, we got some tabs to give you some extra details, and one of the most exciting ones is the voting history page.   1918\u00d71131 189 KB   This is brand new. We just pushed this to our release on Tuesday, and I am excited about this feature. It gives the entire voting history for any given delegate. You can see the poll they voted on, the option they voted for, and you can also give this quick view of how the votes went. The percentage of yes and no. This is a really good way to look at a delegate, make sure that you see what they are voting on, and see if this is somebody you would be interested in delegating to. You can make those decisions based on looking at these data. Each poll has a discussion link where you can join the conversation about this particular poll. One other thing about the delegate contracts is that they expire after a year, and we have the expiration date for people to be aware of what that looks like when this delegate contract was created and when it will expire.   1910\u00d71137 195 KB   1893\u00d71128 218 KB   1913\u00d71138 186 KB   Once you look at some of these polls, you can dig into them, click on the poll, and it brings you to the detailed polling page. This page has been around for a while, but we have a nice visualization that we have added to the vote breakdown. You have the traditional vote breakdown: yes, no, abstain, and we also added some new features. There is the voting by address table where you can see exactly who is voting on a given poll, what they are voting on, the MKR amount they are voting with, and the percentage of their voting power (percentage of their total votes). The delegates have their names mapped to the column, and those who are not delegates are also listed.   1911\u00d71138 147 KB   The same data is presented in this Pack Circle Chart, which gives you an idea of the size of everybody\u2019s votes, how people are voting, and the direction people are taking. In a future enhancement, we are looking to give more nuanced detail about this Maker weight. You may know that it is a complicated process to pull in all the different weights with polling. If you have a Vote Proxy, a Hot Wallet, a Cold Wallet, and you have got MKR locked into chief, and MKR that is in your wallet, you have to pull from all these various places to calculate your voting weight, and that could be tricky. If we could provide a breakdown for this, some external links to Etherscan or whatnot, that would give a lot more context for users. The features that we are looking for are things that will help people make informed decisions, and people can look at it and verify things like Maker weight and where votes are going. The idea is that everyone can be an auditor.   1911\u00d71138 147 KB   1913\u00d71135 196 KB   1920\u00d71133 198 KB   1914\u00d71138 195 KB   1919\u00d71140 201 KB   1920\u00d71133 157 KB   When you look at the voting addresses, you can click on the profiles, taking you back to the profile page. Every address has a profile page, and we just fetch the data for that address. Like the delegate\u2019s profile page that we looked at, this will give you the polling vote history. You can see this is a regular address of voters, and you can look at all the polling they have been involved in. You can plug your address in there if you want to see your vote history and look at all this data side by side. If I drill into this example, it looks like there is a more interesting vote breakdown to take a look at. Looking at the Pack Circle Chart, you get a sense of who is voting \u201cno\u201d and who is voting \u201cyes.\u201d We have our three biggest delegates and then some shadow delegates. It gives you some context as to the poll, who is voting for and against it. It allows people to dig in and make some better decisions with that data.   1920\u00d71138 194 KB   1918\u00d71136 179 KB   1920\u00d71135 150 KB   1920\u00d71123 179 KB   Those are the features that we pushed up to the release. There are a lot more little features. We have been doing a lot of optimizations. One fun feature that you might have already seen is the Dark Mode. People can vote late at night. We have some new filters. The filters for the polls were not working well, so we added improvements.  Future Work:  1909\u00d71134 156 KB   1919\u00d71139 156 KB   I want to show a quick preview of some features that we are working on for the future that are not released yet. We will go in line with helping people make informed decisions. On a Delegate Profile Page, we are going to add a voting weight over time. It would be a graph that shows how much MKR was delegated to the person over some time. You can look at whether more people or fewer people are delegating and see the pattern. Eventually, you will decide if you want to delegate your MKR to this person or not based on these trends.   1920\u00d71137 212 KB   Another feature that I am super excited about is a Poll Comparison Compatibility Page. We will compare two addresses to show the user their compatibility with any other delegate by comparing everybody\u2019s vote history. In the example, we see that we voted the same on this poll, on this poll, but on another poll, we differed. By taking that data and comparing two different vote histories, we can create a Compatibility Score that we could potentially add to the page so that people can look who the delegate most represents their similar interests. Those are features that we are interested in digging into. We want to figure out ways to verify the displayed data and allow people to make informed decisions about how they vote and or whom they delegate to, etc. I believe that is all I was going to show so we can do a little QA. If there is time for that, I am willing to take some questions.   Questions  Q: Are there any difficulties in visualizing rank choice polling at all that you have come across?  A: We have done for that is just show the option they voted for and the winning option. We did a little manual workaround to get the ranked-choice ones to work with the voting history page. There is probably some more research we could do, but we wanted to go for the quick win of the plurality polls. I do not see any in this person\u2019s history, but we would just show the winning option and the option they voted for on this page here.     1920\u00d71136 178 KB   Max (from chat): What percent of MKR is delegated? What percent of MKR is voting?  A: We have that in our system stats, and it is marked as total delegated, and I do not know the percentage of the total extent MKR. Still, in this case, we have 73 000 over seven recognized delegates and six shadow delegates.   LongForWisdom: One thing that I would also like to see is the number of addresses delegating. So you can see how many larger and smaller people using the system  A: That is another feature in progress and something similar to that pack circle chart. You could look at a delegate and see all the people delegated to it and how much MKR they are delegating to this delegate. We have some of that in progress as well.     1920\u00d71136 194 KB   Burban: Has the team been thinking about any notification service that can help voters with their experience.  A: We have had opened up some talks with Ethereum Push Notification Service if you are familiar with what they do. There are different ways of doing it, but they are working on an integration for us right now. We had got some demos from them the other day. One potential way would be: when a new poll is created, a new executive is created, or a poll is about to end. These are some of the events that we have talked about with them about recording. It is a third-party thing, so you have to download a plug-in for your browser. They have an API too, but that would require more work on our side. We are looking into getting this very basic EPNS integration done soon. If it looks good and we approve of it, we will push it out and share it.   David Utrobin: I am curious if any more thought has been given to the comment feature. I know it came out for Executive votes, and it is sparingly used. Can we get it to Governance polls? Where are we at with that?  A: That is an interesting question that has come up a lot in the interviews with some delegates and other holders. Communication, in general, seems to be something that is closely tied to this, and it is hard to integrate with. We do not have any specific plans for integrating the comments into the polls. Still, it is something that we could talk about put in our roadmap. Our product manager Deniz is currently working hard on developing our roadmap and helping us put together a backlog. Come to our Discord or Frill page for people who have feature ideas, and feel free to contribute those. We have no plans for that, but if it is something that people want to see, we will look into it.   Q: What about governance effectiveness? Do you have any idea of building metrics that can track the effectiveness of Governance or wallets within it?  A: That is a great question. It has come up in our brainstorming. We do not have any concrete implementation for that. We do have these participation metrics. That is not exactly governance effectiveness, but it is delegate effectiveness, and these come from GovAlpha. We talk a lot about how your vote impacts the future, how we can get those statistics. For example, one of the things that we will add soon is these on-chain effects feature that shows you the effect of an Executive vote and how that would affect the Protocol. We have been working with the token flow on this; Finding ways to measure that impact over some time would be awesome and something that we want to do. We have not had much real technical research into it, but it is definitely on our priority list. But the impact is one of the best ways to drum up enthusiasm. It shows where your vote goes and what your vote did and makes you feel that you are having an impact when you are voting. Anyway, we can display that and measure that for the user. I think it is really powerful. So definitely expect something along those lines in the next year or so. I cannot give you a timeline.     Conclusion  LongForWisdom 1:08:28  Thank you very much. We appreciate the walkthrough. It is looking better and better every day.  Phil Bain: There is a CU Launch Pod Session coming up with the DUX Team next Wednesday, and we will do more of a deep dive into the team and our mission vision strategy.   The DUX Core Unit is also up for voting now.  David Utrobin: There might be people in this meeting that were not here last week. You just sat through a different formatted G&R call\u2014just a quick note on that. We are moving away from doing general team updates on this call. Transparency is very important, but this is not the format for it. Teams will not be doing those. We recommend that teams post written updates on the forum for reference, for completing information, and it is the easiest format to do it in. These calls are now going to be way more engagement than discussion-focused. Juan Guill\u00e9n: I posted the calls that SES will be having, which are not a few, and I do not know if the Summaries Team can pick those up so that they are a little bit more shield. Thank you to everyone.   LongForWisdom: Thanks to everyone for coming. I will talk to you all next week.

My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the Governance Facilitator for MakerDAO. We have our usual agenda to get through this week. We have updates from all the major Core Units, MIPs submission review, and a segment with SebVentures about the MakerDAO monthly financials for April. If you want to ask questions or have comments, please do speak up. Everyone here enjoys answering questions. We recently set up an anonymous question box. So if anybody has questions, feel free to submit them in that box. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to discuss them in the following meetings.   Weekly Updates  Governance  LongForWisdom 02:11   Last week\u2019s executive vote has passed. This brought us Liquidations 2.0 on the largest Vault types, including ETH-A, WBTC-A, ETH-B, and ETH-C. It also added a DeFiSaver as an oracle light feed, increasing the number of light feeds and off-boarded one oracle dark feed that we had decided to retire. Overall, that was a big step forward, especially for Liq 2.0. Protocol Engineering will have comments on it later. We\u2019ve got two polls adding more Vaults to the Liq 2.0 framework, the ERC20 vaults that aren\u2019t Uniswap LPs. There\u2019s also a poll to decrease the UNI-V2-DAI-USDCA liquidation ratio from 110% to 105%, which also passed. These changes will make it into the executive this week on Friday. They will be joined by the Core Unit Budget Distributions for May. So, therefore, the setup we\u2019re falling into is to do the monthly distributions of budgets on the first executive of the month tomorrow. This would involve all the core units except for Protocol Engineering because they already had this part of the monthly cycle.   Gov Alpha  LongForWisdom 04:06  DSpot has pushed a new version of the MIPs portal to the live production URL. This brings some cool functionality involving advanced filtering and searches options, which can be combined with MIP tags to help construct relative lists of MIPs, whatever list of whatever MIPs you want. As an example, we can list accepted technical MIPs that have not yet been implemented. This can help Protocol Engineering know what\u2019s in the queue to work on. We can set up a view that shows all the currently active budgets or proposals and see the latest budget from all the Core Units or active declarations to intent, stuff like that. A huge thanks to DSpot and Pablo for working on that. We\u2019ve also been working with delegates over the last week. We had a meeting, and I\u2019ve been having some async discussions with community members who might want to be the first delegates. We are figuring out what Gov Alpha needs to produce for the delegates and what the delegates need to produce, attempting to plan a coordinated launch for delegation. More on that as things progress. We\u2019ve also been working on our ongoing budget for the next quarter, which will be in the forum by next Wednesday for the next Governance cycle. There have also been other initiatives that we\u2019ve been pursuing; Eli\u2019s spoke to Snapshots about getting set up for KR. Snapshot is a voting system that many other protocols use. Eli\u2019s also been working on reorganizing the forum again. I know we\u2019ve just changed it fairly recently, but this is an ongoing process to make it more accessible and functional. It\u2019s important that as it grows, we do not let it get out of control. Finally, purely on a personal note and because a couple of you mentioned it in the last few meetings, the MKR compensation working group is still meeting regularly. We are planning to have something on the 10th, which is next Monday.   Questions 07:06  David: Regarding the compensation working group, there was talk about trying to recruit somebody from the outside to weigh in. Has that person ever been found, and what\u2019s the status of the working group members?  LongForWisdom: We made efforts to try and find someone external. We spoke to a couple of references that came through. However, the timeline was too tight to really further pursue any of those. We spoke to some of the VCs as well, the larger MKR holders, who are not quite 3rd parties, to get them to provide feedback and input. However, we had conversations with a couple of them, and they were busy. But it\u2019s been going fairly well so far.   Aaron (chat): Is delegation open to anyone? It sounds exclusive based on you having meetings with the first users.  LongForWisdom: There\u2019ll be a delegation contract factory that anyone can set up and use to set up the delegate contracts. They can do whatever they want; They can speak to MKR holders privately and convince them to delegate. It will always be open for anyone to use that contract and to become a delegate. We\u2019re going to try and set it up so there are some public delegates and help delegates get more visibility. We will standardize some stuff like personal statements from the delegates and set up communications channels, and stuff, where the community can talk to them and delegates can talk to each other to clearly communicate and discuss why they\u2019re voting the way they\u2019re voting. It is going to be entirely opt-in. It\u2019s not exclusive in any way. Holders who aren\u2019t heavily involved in the community can see some of the potential delegates and get a good idea of who they want to delegate to.     Forum at a Glance  Elihu 10:10 Forum at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote inactive threads, that would be much appreciated.  Three-Point Summary  DAI slippage is down to 0.06% on a $10,000 trade. A record 4.4B DAI is currently in circulation. Total volume locked in Maker is $12.3B.   Announcements  As part of its dissolvement, Maker Foundation has transferred 84,000 MKR to Governance from the Development Fund.   Discussions   MakerDAO Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Capital Allocation   @Aes starts a conversation on Key Performance Indicators and how they relate to MakerDAO.    Should we have a cooldown period before deciding how to spend the Foundation\u2019s MKR tokens?  With Governance coming into possession of a large amount of MKR, @AstronautThis advocates for a cooldown period before deciding what the DAO should use it for.    Vault Compensation Plan v3 - A Vault Compensation Support DAO to assure a better MakerDAO Governance  Ongoing - The discussion around Black Thursday and potential compensation of involved parties continues.     Signal Requests   Increase the DSR   @mrabino1 is seeking consensus around raising the DSR and the preferred mechanism of doing so.    Adjust KNC-A Debt Ceiling   @monet-supply is looking to reduce the Debt Ceiling to 0 for the KNC-A Vault type.    Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 4 May 2021  A new set of proposed parameter changes by the MakerDAO Open Market Committee is up.     Protocol Engineering Team Update  Christopher Mooney 11:49  We have 10 collateral types that we\u2019re putting in this week. All the remaining collateral types are, shall we say, standard, typical first-order collateral types; non-LP tokens and non-stablecoins. These are UNI, ZRX, AAVE, BAT, renBTC, LRC, MANA, COMP, KNC, and BAL, which will be done this week. Then, we\u2019ve been working with the mandated actors and figuring out the proper rollout for the upcoming weeks, which may change the schedule a little bit. All the LP tokens have been scheduled for next week. Also, we\u2019re at the block gas limit for what we can do in one of these spells. Risk also wanted more time to think about stablecoins. Thereby, we yanked those stable coins out to contribute to the block gas limit. We also have the LP oracle reviews coming in. We feel confident about that code. We\u2019re thinking about flipping next week to be the LP oracle updates for all of the LP tokens. This would give Risk more time to do their assessments on each LP tokens. The following week, we would do all of the LP tokens. The week after that, we would do all of the stablecoins. The only one with liquidations on is USDT. I should mention that the LP token for DAI-USDC would be in the stablecoin batch. I know that\u2019s a lot to think through without a diagram, but we\u2019re a little up in the air about what we want to deploy. That\u2019s four more weeks of Liq 2.0 and LP Oracle updates. We\u2019re also doing the other Core Unit Budget Distributions in this upcoming spell. Big milestone: Liq 2.0 is released for all ETH and WBTC, our largest collateral types. We are mostly out of the woods on Liq 1.2 risk. In fact, we\u2019re in a pretty good situation right now. We\u2019ve been putting work into the backstop keeper to ensure that people can run it. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of people to run it to backstop the protocol. We know of one other keeper group that\u2019s up and running. We observed an unknown keeper in the wild using Sushiswap as their backstop, and they were doing the flash lending. So there\u2019s quite a bit of coverage from the keeper side, and I think Derek and the JS team will release the Web3 Metamask UI by the end of the day. Through that, anyone will be able to show up with a Metamask wallet. As long as you have some DAI in your wallet, you\u2019ll be able to participate in liquidation. It looks like there\u2019s a good yield to be had. Aside from that, we\u2019ve got a bunch of big reviews going on right now. We\u2019ve got the DssVest contract that we\u2019ve been looking at. There are the delegate voting changes to the voting proxy that we\u2019ve got out for review. The Sushi joint adapter is out for audits, and we were also spending a lot of time on the Optimism DAI bridge this week. Brian McMichael: The DssExec Lib did undergo the update to Liq 2.0. We should be able to start onboarding collaterals directly with Liq 2.0 features out of the box.   Questions 16:48  Matthew Rabinowitz: Are there any other L2 bridges that you guys are looking at right now? ZKSync or others?  Chris: Yes, there are. It\u2019s mostly Bartek and Chris that have been taking a look at that. We were talking about, I\u2019m forgetting the name of it, begins with an \u2018A.\u2019 Krzystof Kaczor: Arbitrum  Chris: Yes. We were talking about that one yesterday. Krzystof Kaczor: It\u2019s another layer tool that has native bridges like ZKSync. It has a lot of DAI. It\u2019s a generic bridge. When they are launched with a generic message-passing, we can develop some better DAI, more native. But for now, there are no smart contracts on the ZKSync. Matthew Rabinowitz: Not yet. But that\u2019s to be launched in the next 60 days. So the question I had was more towards planning of using Optimism and having the equivalent of almost an EBM home for doing something with Maker rather than just transferring DAI around. If ZKSync begins to support EBM or other L2 components, do we plan to have homes in other L2 EBM areas? Chris: The answer is broadly yes. We haven\u2019t looked in-depth at other bridges. We\u2019re currently looking for anything that\u2019s permissionless and allows us to go across. I will say that for Optimism, in addition to just moving DAI across, we actually have the facility to send across governance actions. The pause proxy can send a message across the bridge and then for that message to be executed on the Optimism side. That\u2019ll allow us a good playground on Optimism. If we can, we will try and extend that methodology to other more permissionless bridges. Chris: I should also mention to the DAO that hiring is going very well. We\u2019ve made an offer and had a candidate accept that offer, but they won\u2019t start for a little while. However, we\u2019re receiving very strong candidates. I want to ensure that all the MKR holders know that voting for the team\u2019s budget and incentives has its desired effect. Other teams are having difficulty sourcing talented people to work for them. Nevertheless, we have people coming to us. Congratulations!     Risk Team Update  Primoz Kordez 20:42  We are about to publish proposed parameters for Liq 2.0 for some of the UNI LPs. As Chris mentioned, we need to make full implementations after next week. Therefore, we will propose parameters, first for LPs that have a relatively higher debt exposure. Because the auction price could be different this time, we decided to go with the LPs with similar parameters. There are three types of LPs: stablecoin-volatile pair, volatile-volatile pair, and stablecoin-stablecoin pair. We\u2019re going to start with stablecoin-volatile UNI pairs because their exposure is the biggest. The idea is to make the auction price flatter because those pairs are about 50% less volatile than the average collateral that Maker holds. We\u2019re also thinking about making the expected duration 60 minutes, instead of the previous 40 minutes. That\u2019s because a flash loan type option settlement is more complex than the UNI LPs. So you need to take extra steps, and we are not sure how many keepers will have this implementation ready from the start. Finally, we may propose a lower auction throughput by limiting the pending auction amount\u2014generally, a bit more conservative auction parameters for UNI LPs. We began working on Sushi LP risk evaluations, beginning with pairs with the highest pool liquidity and APY. These are mostly stablecoin-ETH pairs, such as DAI-ETH, USDC-ETH, but could also include renBTC-ETH because their pool is the biggest. We should have these evaluations ready next week. The Parameter Proposal Group released a new proposal for May. This month\u2019s changes are light: we try to make the users unwind their positions in stablecoin Vaults. Similarly, we proposed the KNC token, which is being migrated to a new version. Finally, we lowered the ETH-C stability fee to incentivize higher usage on a safer ETH vault. Next week, we are aiming to release some interesting models. They will still be in beta. The idea is to deploy our risk calculations to a web app. The community will check the latest risk premiums based on the state of the world, on the liquidity, input metrics, etc. It\u2019ll be for every collateral that Maker holds. Potentially, we\u2019ll deploy a version where the users will tweak the inputs and simulate outputs. Lastly, there\u2019s a deadline for the quarterly adjustment next week. We have new members in our team who replaced people that couldn\u2019t devote much time. Together, we are specifically dedicated to building this risk web app. We contacted community members who do awesome work with various Maker data analytics. Some tools are risk-related, and we decided to allocate a part of our grant budget to have them compensated for that. LongForWisdom: Thanks, Primoz. The Risk roadmap you mentioned sounds pretty cool. Primoz Kordez: Yes, all the links we share in Google Sheets are not user-friendly. It\u2019s still in beta, but hopefully, it\u2019ll be interesting to see and play with.   Real-World Finance Team Update  Sebastien Derivaux 26:19  I\u2019ve just published the monthly reports of the Core Unit and the financial reports discussed later in this call and the RWA report.  We will create a RWA committee that would be a layer between the RWF Team that provides risk assessments and provides some RWA reports and Governance that may want to have something more actionable than only risk assessments. We will publish some risk assessments next week. They are all more than 20 pages. It\u2019s a good idea to have a committee decide what is a good asset and modify the DC or stability fees. Interest rates in the real world are not permanently fixed. It would be great to avoid having too much of a burden on MKR or Governance and delegate some stuff to a committee. Obviously, the RWF Team will be part of it but won\u2019t have any say. On the legal side, we worked on documentation to help Arnold & Porter, LLP, to be up to date with Maker. Next week, we are focusing on getting four Centrifuge assets to be ready for onboarding at the end of the month. We will have the risk assessment for all of them published next week. These are ConsoleFreight, which already has a risk assessment. Moss Carbon Credit; the risk assessment is almost done. Fortunafi, which is a revenue base of finance. And People\u2019s Company, which is farmland. The idea is to have a big batch, and Governance will decide which will be onboarded. Last item: Matthew published a lot of documentation on the trust model on the forum last week. Please, review those documents.   Questions 29:24  LongForWisdom: The committee you mentioned; Would that work in the same way as the open market committee parameter proposal group currently for crypto assets?  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Yes. We saw that the Maker open market committee solved many issues. Last December, we spent a lot of time on the forum arguing on the DC and stability fees and all that stuff. Now it\u2019s been quiet on that front. We can focus on other stuff. That\u2019s the whole of the RWA committee, but maybe more on reading the risk assessment and making strategies for expressing an opinion. It\u2019s difficult for the RWF Team to say this \u2018asset is not good,\u2019 \u2018you shouldn\u2019t invest,\u2019 or \u2018this one is super good.\u2019 It\u2019s always balanced and difficult. That\u2019s why we need a community of diverse people to speak as a group on whether an asset is good to invest in because it\u2019s too much work for each MKR holder to digest all the reports. LongForWisdom: Yeah. That makes a lot of sense.     Growth Core Unit Update  Nadia Alvarez 31:30 Growth CU Weekly Update  This week, we are reorganizing the group and exploring new opportunities in other geographies. We want to focus on Africa, more exactly Nigeria. We began to work with Binance\u2019s peer-to-peer network to expand Dai as a savings currency in Nigeria. It\u2019s an interesting country for us because there are no other available stable coins. People in Nigeria need a different currency than the one they currently have. We are also talking with other crypto companies looking for alternatives to manage the on and offramp of crypto after the ban they had suffered. We are giving them options from things that we personally learned. In some Latin American countries, the same happened, and we have experience with that. We are also talking with various funds. Many funds want to open a Vault, but they want changes in the risk parameters. They want to open these big Vaults and mint a lot of Dai, but they prefer the terms. I don\u2019t know if we have spoken about this in the past. Are we interested in special and customed-made Vaults for these huge funds that would open a billion Dai Vault but with specific parameters? In Latin America, we are finding many partners who are exploring other sidechains or L2 solutions due to gas fees. However, these last few weeks, the gas fees have been exceptionally low. These potential partners are exploring Binance, SmartChain, Polygon, and RSK because they are in Latin America. I support what Matt mentioned: we have to begin looking toward other chains. When we were in the Foundation, we worked with many different chains, and we helped create the bridge. For example, RSK and Clayton are examples of those networks. We should be more focused on that. It\u2019s a huge opportunity, and we need to be more proactive. Besides having Dai on Binance and SmartChain, we should start thinking if we could do something else. Finally, Jen closed the integration with BitPay. This is huge. Dai will be used to pay via BitPay, and it will also be used as a settlement currency.  Jen Senhaji: I can elaborate on the BitPay deal. This is exciting for us. It\u2019s been a long time in the making. What that immediately provides to Dai is access to all of the merchants on BitPay\u2019s network, such as Microsoft, Twitch, American Red Cross, Newegg, and even private jets. The CMO of one of these jet companies told me that they\u2019re one of the higher volume merchants as of late. Many people who are doing well in this full cycle are riding around more often in private jets. If anybody wants to book a jet with their Dai, they may do so through BitPay. They also have a gift card network within their app with many major brands where you can easily make purchases using Dai. They do settlements in cryptocurrency within over 200 countries. They also have a service where you can do invoicing. Even if you are not a merchant, setting up an account with BitPay and doing payroll or other types of cross-border payment through their dashboard is possible with Dai. They recently launched a Visa debit card that allows you to make purchases with any of the cryptos they support, including Dai. This allows us to work more closely with some of these big merchants, like Twitch. Think about cool co-promotion opportunities as we figure out what we want to do from a marketing standpoint in the next months. We are excited and look forward to using some of these services as a Dai holder.   Nadia: Concerning admin stuff, we are looking for someone in Europe to join our team. If you know anybody interested in being part of the team, send me a message. We are also incorporating our company. that is a very important part of what we do. We usually have to sign agreements with partners, and we need a legal entity to back up those agreements. I hope that by the end of the month we have everything set up. We are also reorganizing our CRM. This week has been great because we spoke with the RWA Core Unit and the Content Core Unit. We are trying to include them in our process and into our CRM to understand what other teams are doing and collaborate between Core Units.   Questions 40:40  Jerry G (chat): Would these large interested parties be using specific types of collateral or collaterals that vaults already exist for?  Nadia: They are interested in collaterals that are already onboarded. However, they ask for different risk parameters. If they want to open a billion-dollar Vault, that\u2019s something to think about.     Operational Support Update  Amy Jung 41:53  The Know Your MIP on Direct Deposit Module is up. There are no new Know Your MIPs or Collateral Onboarding calls coming up. We\u2019re slowing down in terms of the number of new proposals for core units that are coming in. We\u2019re thinking of it in terms of waves. The first wave was Risk, Governance, and RWF, and those are complete. They\u2019re growing, received budgets, and we have all the updates. We\u2019ve just completed wave two, which is a total of seven core units. Then, finally, we\u2019re coming into wave three, a formal submission of two core units, with one still in RFC. Regarding core units, a few interesting questions came up. One of them is around different principles. Some core units have their vision of what Maker should do or where they should go. At the same time, another core unit will not be in conflict but will have different principles or different ways to get there. It\u2019s interesting to watch these things being resolved. The question is if they\u2019re not resolved, is it something we should keep an eye on, or let it resolve itself? As long as we have the same end goal, it gets resolved on its own, but we want to keep an eye on that. Another question concerns considering standardizing and striving for consistency. When we were at wave one, Matt asked when we would go through something like compensation that the holders wouldn\u2019t have to go through each of these different variations. Now that we\u2019ve gone through the third wave, we\u2019re asking similar questions. We\u2019ve been trying to figure that out, notably around budget reporting. There\u2019s no one way to do the budgets, and different teams have done them differently. So the question for us is whether we should continue developing a better model for consistency. Are we allowing core units to nurture their treasury with the budget they requested? What might be the conflicts? Nobody has said they were going to do that, but we might have a case like that. A smaller question came up from talking to individuals. We have many core units which bring domain expertise with strong strategies; we expect core units to be super polished. At the same time, there hasn\u2019t been much room for those still in development. When getting hired by a regular company, is there an expectation in what to do right away? Are you rather joining a smaller group which is the strategic side of the larger group? The expectations there are a bit different. As smaller groups appear in Maker, more people ask about contributing in leaner aspects that don\u2019t fit into the existing core units. The question is, how should we make way for that? We have weekly office hours now with Governance, Protocol Engineering, Content Production, and Growth. They\u2019re informal and not recorded; feel free to drop by and ask questions. LongForWisdom: Great, thank you, Amy. I\u2019ll echo that office hour are a good habit for core units to get into. I\u2019m hoping all the core units will find time for that in the future. Also, it will be valuable to keep channels of communications between core unit members and the Governance open.   MIPs Update  Charles St. Louis 50:20  3018\u00d71697 209 KB   3013\u00d71691 298 KB   3007\u00d71685 265 KB   3019\u00d71689 229 KB   Submission Review  LongForWisdom 56:13  All those listed proposals will move to inclusion polls next Monday. We will bundle the Core Units proposals into their each poll. Some community members have strong feelings about a few of the proposals coming through this month. If you haven\u2019t noticed this, check out the forum threads for these proposals. If you are concerned, start raising awareness.   Anonymous Question Box Discussion  Payton Rose 59:33  We have one suggestion from the Anonymous Question Box. The suggestion was titled \u201cCut down the Core Units presenting during the G&R call.\u201d I\u2019ll go ahead and read it out: \u201cSince this is a Governance & Risk call, please only allow Governance actors, Smart Contracts team, Risk, MIP editors, and Oracle\u2019s teams to perform their presentation to the community on Thursdays. Core Units like RWAs, Operational Support, and Growth can meet every other Friday, titled RWAs, OS, and Growth bi-weekly call. Thus, the community will get more out of discussions pertaining only to Governance & Risk\u201d. We spoke about that during our last meeting, but I\u2019m happy to entertain some discussion here. The only other suggestion was asking for six million dollars, so we don\u2019t need to go into that, haha. LongForWisdom: Yes. We\u2019ve been thinking about this as well as it\u2019s been mentioned before. I\u2019m worried that with multiple meetings, it\u2019s difficult to draw the line between cutting people off from the Thursday meeting and pushing them to the auxiliary meeting. The justification that this is just Governance & Risk seems flimsy considering that the suggestion included Smart Contracts and Oracles. If you will include Smart Contracts and Oracles, why not RWF? that can have risk issues, right? I\u2019m skeptical about drawing a line and saying, \u201cthese people should be in the meeting, and others shouldn\u2019t.\u201d I\u2019m open if anybody has feedback.  David Utrobin: I like this call for a weekly town hall for all the Core Units. Yes, it\u2019s Governance & Risk, but part of Governance is to have a weekly update and place where you can de-silo information sharing. So having all the Core Units have a voice on a single call every week is an important backbone that we should preserve at MakerDAO. Brian McMichael: If we put another meeting on the calendar, that\u2019s another hour a week that the rest of us will break off and not be writing code. Maybe the solution could be to change the name of the meeting, if that is the problem, to the Weekly Town Hall. It is nice to have this one meeting to get the whole cake of what\u2019s going on. Even in the Protocol Engineering team, we are in the middle of the system. Still, we don\u2019t keep track of everything that is going on because we are heads down. David Utrobin: If people are interested in more in-depth information about specific Core Units or things like Risk, Governance decisions, engineering details, and problems, there should be the Office Hours Call. Also, teams should be proactive about documentation and sharing certain things that would be interesting to stakeholders. The point being, supplemental calls are good. Schuppi: I don\u2019t know if this needs to be done once a week. Maybe every two weeks is fine enough, and having a 5-minute sum-up of what we\u2019ve been doing, what we are doing in the next week, and what we are focusing on. It doesn\u2019t need to take long. Chris is doing it for Smart Contracts; it\u2019s exactly the right amount of information. I don\u2019t like the idea of having an update on Governance and Risk. There are so many parts relevant to what we are achieving or trying to achieve. Maybe the title of the meeting is wrong. If we had a second meeting, then I would go to the second meeting. If it takes 17 minutes, it\u2019s good information for me. Matthew Robinowitz: Schuppi\u2019s opinion mixed with a combination of office hours within the specific domains provides a great opportunity for people to ask questions. Within a year, we will find ourselves with ten times the content but still need a way to break it up. Those office hours are going to be essential, in my view, but this summary package is a great way to deliver the content in an hour and a half. LongForWisdom: I\u2019m hearing a lot of positive sentiments. Sometimes is easier to share positive sentiments than negative ones. If anybody thinks otherwise, please feel free to get in touch with me. Several people have suggested changing the name of the call., which is something we can look into.     Other Presentations and Updates  Monthly Financial Report  Sebastien Derivaux 1:06:17  As a reminder, you can always find all of the financial information on finance.makerdao.network.   2527\u00d71421 164 KB   2517\u00d71411 177 KB   The average yield is lower than March because the mix between all the Vaults facilities changed significantly. Two months ago, we decreased the stability fees on some smaller Vaults, and now there is usage on those. We are still highly dependent on ETH. This chart only has ETH-A, but we also have ETH-B and ETH-C. Most of the income is still coming from ETH, and the rest is diversified. On the loan side, we crossed the two billion mark.   2525\u00d71407 238 KB   For the first time last month, someone was converting DAI to USDC. We have some outflows on the PSM (the red lines). Soon after, there was a lot of DAI demand again, and the PSM grew again. We are not making as much money on the outflows because the fees are four business points, while on the inflow, the fees are ten business points. It\u2019s too early to tell if Uniswap V3 will change something or not. Nonetheless, it\u2019s still a good amount of money, 150,000 Dai. The inventory of stablecoins is up to one billion due to the significant increase in PAX. We have 100 million PAX tokens, but that was the main Vault user, and the PAX Vaults are not generating any fees. That\u2019s why the Maker open market committee will make the proposal to decrease the DC of PAX.   2519\u00d71405 170 KB   2527\u00d71417 179 KB   At the end of last month, we were close to 4 million. We are above, and we have 27 liquidity reserves, which gives you the amount of stable coin we have to sustain a decreased demand of DAI. If 27% of DAI want to change from DAI to USDC, PAX, or whatever, the price of DAI will remain the same.   2521\u00d71411 182 KB   There was growth in all stablecoins and mainly in BUSD. BUSD is continuing to win market share over USDT because Binance is the first exchange, and there was a lot of USDT on Binance. So now it\u2019s going to BUSD. USDC and DAI remain constant more or less. We are at 11% since September of last year. In February, we were at 17%, but it was mainly due to a big transaction. So we stayed flat on the market share, which is maybe something we need to improve going forward. At the same time, we have a huge liquidity pool of stablecoins.   2511\u00d71411 152 KB   2527\u00d71415 250 KB   This is half the bad news: The recurring earning yield was down from last month. It is not because we are making less money. On the contrary, we are making more money than last month, but as the MKR price increased by 100%, it is no good for the recurring earnings yield, which is annualized.   2527\u00d71417 141 KB   2525\u00d71407 176 KB   Open Discussion 1:16:56  LongForWisdom: Regarding the on-chain transfer of stablecoins, is that ETH or other chains as well?  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: It\u2019s only ETH. There is a lot of value to get from analyzing the transactions because it\u2019s difficult to clearly understand what is happening. For instance, we can track the balance of DAI, USDC, and all the stablecoins at each exchange. Tracking some exchanges in specific markets is obvious. For example, Binance is worldwide, but some exchanges are mainly in Asia and others in Latin America. Finally, we can track where DAI is getting more traction, but it is a lot of work.   LongForWisdom: It makes more sense to focus on specific protocols, such as all of the stablecoins used in Uniswap for trades. Would it be worth comparing the Uniswap trade volume on DAI versus USDC?  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Yes, and following to IUSD and LUSD liquidity protocol. Suppose you have a lot of DAI in Compound but expect that Uniswap V3 will destroy Compound or only destroy Uniswap V2 by being more capital efficient. In that case, you can predict that the DAI demand will decrease significantly. We have a lot of DAI on Compound and Uniswap V2. which can be important for the protocol. If we have 1 billion DAI used in Uniswap V2 and Compound, which I think is the case, all the transfers are going through Uniswap V3. If this capital is no longer needed and people stop farming, they may repay the loan. Thereby, DAI demand will decrease, and we will make fewer fees. One billion, when you have only three million of loan on standing, is a lot. That can be an issue, but I don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019m not planning time this month to work on that subject.   Will Remor: I\u2019ve seen reports done by some of the analytics team on predicting future evaluations from many cache files accumulating from all the stablecoins. They performed some backtesting on previous moments in the market when cache files had accumulated. But, still, it was the outflow of that accumulation into actual evaluations of different protocols. We found it may be something that we should keep an eye on for the amount of liquidity coming into the system.  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Yes, it makes sense. Will Remor: We want to potentially keep track of what is going on in finance matching because there\u2019s a lot of projects. We should publish once every week for products to promote some hype to bring in users. There\u2019s been some virtualization, especially in the DEX market. S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Yes, that\u2019s true. However, I have decided that the Binance chain doesn\u2019t exist, so\u2026 Will Remor: Many people, like me, ignored it for a long time, and then people from my family who weren\u2019t involved in crypto begin telling me, \u201cHey, I\u2019m doing such and such on Binance,\u201d which shocked me. S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Yes, I had the same experience. We should focus more energy to look into what Binance is doing. Will Remor: Binance is taking the place of EOS in the Ethereum community since a few years ago. A lot of water under the bridge has passed since then, and now Binance is doing the same thing.   LongForWisdom: Please, remember the Anonymous Question Box. Also, feel free to leave a comment on YouTube, and we\u2019ll get to it in the next meeting. Christopher Mooney: I spent most of this call having a heart attack because the total value locked on DeFi pulse dropped, but I think I figured out the bug in their script. Everything is fine.

New Core Units: IS-001, SAS-001, and DECO-001   Forum at a Glance Forum at a Glance: November 18 - 25  Team-led Discussions  Core Unit Operations  Budgeting, Accounting, and Reporting  We need to focus on all Core Units to present their operations efficiently and correctly.  Poor or late information hurts RWF production of Core Unit reports.   It can be difficult for facilitators to manage their Core Unit finances at an optimal level. There is community support for a CU finances team to help all Core Units. There are spreadsheets that help with forward guidance, account, and more; ask PECU, RWF, and SES.  However, getting all the information takes some time.   How would you structure large upfront costs into the DSSvest stream?  You would need those funds from the beginning or account some of them into the initial budget.   Derek is planning to present a review of these spreadsheets. Are we employees or contractors under MakerDAO?  How can we correctly set up an Accounting Core Unit?   Nadia hired an accountant for GRO-001 finances. It will be very helpful for optimizing and gauging the success of new initiatives if we have access to all Core Units accounting.   Cross-Function Initiative Coordination  How well are we aware of all Core Unit initiatives, internal communication, and understand Core Unit schedules?  The problem with cross-functional Core Unit initiatives is that they require transparency and public communication.   Maker needs to be more straightforward with communication on forums to support collaterals and their failsafe or liquidations.   Adding Support for the 1BPS GUNI Pool  Onboard G-UNI for UniV3\u2019s new 0.01% fee tier Most of the volume will go through the 1BPS pool, and it makes sense to support it. Should improve liquidity and leverage same as done with the 5BPS pool. What are methods to be more efficient with handling these types of collaterals?  It will be very easy to onboard the 1BPS pool. We can point a D3M at the AAVE GUNI market for better results. But if we have to jump around a lot, we can try to delegate for another protocol to do it for us.   We can reduce oracle costs and poke time to better levels that are still low risk. What is PPG\u2019s position on this?  PPG is watching the fees, and it needs to be unwinded.

Yesterday, retro hosted a call; please check it out if anyone is interested in seeing different possibilities of scaling Maker into real-world finance. Regarding the CoreUnit operations, I have not done the slides. However, there are different things that we wanted to highlight. We have been doing it ourselves, as we often do, in what we call this dog food project, where we try things for ourselves, and then we suggest things that have been working, and we improve on things that have not: budgeting, accounting or reporting.   2198\u00d71266 113 KB  14:18  Sam: Ari from Gelato has introduced - Cassandra, by the way. He has introduced the one bips pool for the genie token Dai USDC. This is in response to swap adding this tear. An ongoing development over the past week is just after we raised the debt ceiling to 500 million for the five-bit spool. You can swap just went and added a one-bit spool sucking all the volume out of the five-bit pool. We were a little uncertain exactly where it would land. We watched it this past week, but it seems pretty clear now. All the volume will go to the one pool, even with 7 million locked in there alone; it is already enough to cover the majority of the trades, it seems. The UniSwap router will probably put most stuff through there; it makes sense to onboard this and supports it. I think, right now is 7 million; it is pretty good. I could see the volume going up significantly if we improve the liquidity with leverage the same way we did the five bips pool, which should boost the fees. We will see where it lands. It makes sense to onboard this. Does anybody have concerns or questions?  15:44  David Utrobin: With the launch of the D3M, I know that a lot of the thinking about how we generate Dai from less scalable collaterals. We could do it as a proxy through the D3M by providing Dai liquidity to other platforms, like Aave and Comp. My question for this GUNI is, is there a possible D3M GUNI sort of integration? Or is it limited because it has to be a specific GUNI type position? What are ways for us to be more efficient in handling these collaterals? Because they seem to take a long time to set up, and then suddenly, one change can throw a real wrench in work. I am thinking about this from a scale and tools perspective.  Sam: Yes, that makes sense. We are referring to: \u201cwe just added this one, and then all of a sudden we are aiming at a moving target here where things change, and we have to waste all this time on the five big spools, and now we have to go to one depth. First, I will say most of the work evaluated the token itself. Now that we have it evaluated like onboarding, the one bips, we can do in a week or two; it will not take long. It is a minimal effort on all the CoreUnits to get this on board. With regards to the D3M, it is an exciting point. I think all Fe is actually in the process of onboarding G and E as well into their AMM market. We could potentially point another D3M at their AMM market and have them sort of more rapidly iterate with these GUNI tokens. That is a possibility. The nice part is that we built the first D3M for Aave, and we get subsequent ones for Aave specifically for free. There is trade out there. The community can decide which way to go if we switch too often. It may make more sense to delegate to another protocol to do that.    18:17  David Utrobin: It is good to hear that; it is like a low lift after that initial work set. Even from an Oracle cost perspective, is there an Oracle cost for this particular pool? Because I know it is just USDC Dai?  Sam: It is not about the Oracle itself; it mainly concerns the OSM. They have to be poked once an hour, regardless of price change. We are doing one thing now for these precisely (because they are the most expensive); you need to evaluate the OSM price. We also noticed that the price barely changes since it is a stable pair. We plan to lower this to once per 24 hours, and we could probably even go lower. It is just so safe and infrequently changing. There is no point in wasting this amount on gas. We should consider the Oracle costs, but we could probably get this to nearly negligible levels if we need to; it is not a big deal for the oracles.   Sebastien: Is it possible to use the DCM technologies and use Uni in the background?  This is the Aave AMM market; more stuff needs to happen. Pointing another D3M at the AMM market is what you would do for that.   Sebastien: I mean, really taking the DCM, maybe it is not a good name. Instead of using Aave in the background, use Gelato in the background. So we get all the fees because the problem is that the market rates on the GUNI are moving. We get other fees; you just dump 100 million out of a billion there.  Sam: I misunderstood; you just directly put the money into the GUNI token? Yes, a possibility. I initially opted to go with this GUNI route, with users depositing because we had minimal work to onboard this. The D3M requires customization for every single protocol we are integrating. This is a lot more engineering time. I was opting to use a standard gem join; it is all like bare-bones Maker stuff to onboard these Genie like a regular token. That was the thinking for that; we have a bigger bang for our buck, if you will, low-hanging fruit here for the PE team. I did not want to occupy many engineering hours with something good, but it is not the highest priority, in my opinion.   David: What is the status of the current pool? Where is it going? I know that PPG recently posted their recommendation to lower the actual stability fee from half a percent to 0.1%. Where do you see that going? Are those vault users well taken care of by making Maker governance? What is the whole process for doing this replacement?  Sam: We watched the fees in the past 24-48 hours. It is around $133 at this point unless it rebounds for some reason. We may even have to go down to 0% or just shut it down. They should unwind themselves. It is unfortunate in the timing. We had everybody winded up to unwind it. This is the nature of the space.    24:00  1826\u00d7872 160 KB   David Utrobin: First of all, it has been less than a year since the first CoreUnit has been ratified. This is crazy considering that as of today, we have 18 ratified and active CoreUnits. In becoming CoreUnits, the facilitator has the responsibility to facilitate the mandate of each CoreUnit. A big part of the culture and CU expectation is to have a sufficient level of transparency into the financing of the CUs. This includes the spending, the budgeting, the reporting, etc. Facilitators, kind of by nature, have not been set up as accountants themselves. Many CUs that our team, SCS, and Ace are talking to are struggling with the accounting and reporting portion. When this happens, it is a lot harder for the Real World Finance Team, guys like Ace, to report on the financing quickly and accurately. One big piece of the operational puzzle for CUs is getting the budgeting, accounting, and reporting efficient, streamlined, and synced between all of us. When each facilitator needs to be individually trained to do this kind of transparency, accounting, it is hard to scale. There have been conversations in the chats and in various calls about giving an overarching accounting and Real-World Finance CU this authority or mandate to help facilitators with this transparency accounting. That is the current state of things. The first prompt that I put up describes recent CU experiences. I could speak from Gov Com\u2019s perspective. We are a team of three people; we were ratified back in August. It took about two months before we could set up our partnership with accountable. All of our contracts were only signed two months later, all in October. In the middle of that, we may have made a couple of mistakes. Previous actuals may have been revised, even after Ace reported them, perhaps back in October. We had a hard time dealing with that when it was small for teams like ours. We have half a million-dollar budget compared to other bigger teams with way bigger budgets. In our experience, we are trying our best. We are thankful for the templates that the SCS team has set up. We are thankful for guys like Ace who follow up and are proactive in pushing us to get those numbers. That is the highest level of experience share I could give you guys. I support an overarching accounting CU or finance CU that could help CU like ours. I am curious to hear from other facilitators who might be on this call about your experiences and whether, in general, how you think reporting, budgeting, accounting, and reporting function should be? Should it be this transparent? I will open it up.  Derek: In terms of my experiences from the get-go, I used the spreadsheet that gives me a line-by-line transaction. Everything that goes out of the multi SIG is very transparent. I then used what the SES group started with; they created a tracking spreadsheet. It has some mechanisms to ensure checks, so forecast helps to do forward-looking budgeting. I am using that, and the experiences with that find it was pretty similar to the spreadsheet I started with; it lets me track individuals. Individuals, in some cases, are individuals or LLCs. I also have auditing companies like chain security, tooling set-ups like Satara, other third parties like block science, and individual LLCs set up for PE. I have not yet gotten it automated, but it is a known monthly process that I go through, having the checks working with other multisig owners to get all those processes sorted. Over the last couple of months, we have been better at forecasting some of the challenges with third parties. We have some slightly larger expenses for audits, and those are not a month-by-month process. Based on how we split the auditing and the contracts coming through, they can be larger or lower. Not a problem; it just sorts of skews the numbers sometimes. My plan to make that more transparent is to summarize the budget, break that down, wire the numbers where they are, give a bit more explanation, and provide that on-chain verification if people have concerns about it. That has all been going well. Some pain points: sometimes it takes a little bit of time and effort to get the invoices from people on one of our third parties. We are a couple of months behind. I will have a significant outflow in the next month to cover that. Due to the way we work, we also need to provide the next quarter or, in some cases, six months of payments upfront to support that access to software over a long period. This can be a big number. My budget reflects that, so it is not a problem. From an accounting point of view, it shows that, up and down, outflow, as needed, is a good question, David.    32:02  David Utrobin: Many of our CU is set up to receive our budgets through a module called DSS best, which gives us a linear distribution of a budget over time. How do you structure upfront six-month software expenses into the DSS best stream? I would imagine a one-time payment. How do you navigate that problem because that is something that you are also struggling with?  Derek: We are lucky in the sense that our third party did not provide the invoice upfront. In the future, if we needed to fund that upfront and be able to put down a deposit, we would need those funds from the get-go. We have had some leeway, and I accounted for that in the initial budget; it gave me some space to handle it. We have had some surplus in the core budget for some time, and we put some of that into the emergency MultiFit SIG because it is higher security. It is not the one we have access to monthly, so it has been parked there. This will be reflected in the half-year or annual audit that we have all the funds, what is surplus, and what has to go back into the surplus buffer or get reallocated if needed elsewhere. Using the spreadsheet from SES has been immensely helpful for the solution. It also works on two levels. Internally, within the CU, we have the line-by-line reference. There is a lot of personal information there that is not shared broadly or beyond the CU itself. Then it abstracts those payments into groups. We can put forward to the community these groups. I want to detail this, which will take a little time to split our L2 costs. What are our core protocol costs? Where are we spending costs specifically on certain contractors to have a more transparent discussion about where costs are and why they are the way they are. I will wrap it up there. In terms of resources, you have here the spreadsheet and want to review it so that people can look at it. That will help compliment the work that those guys have been doing. If there are any questions, feel free to jump in.    34:49  Unknown: Are our CUs supposed to be contractors of the DAO, or are they part of the DAO themselves? If they are just contractors, it is the money, money, and MKR that goes out the door that matters. Whereas if they are part of the DAO, like employees, we need to investigate a little more into what gets spent. We should at least have the right for our finance folks to ask for more line-by-line stuff. The easier approach from the Dallas perspective is that all these Core Units are contractors. Then, are they performing? Are we getting our money\u2019s worth? We do not have to mess around with all the internal finance.  David: If you treat it that way, the challenge is to check that they perform well and that the accounting has integrity. Even within our team, I can only really use my example. I am on a salary, and our other two full-time team members are also on a salary. Are we working for a salary under this specific entity for our team? Yes. Are we salaried employees of the DAO? I have no idea. Our team also has eight to 11 different, on and off, part-time contributors who all bill approximately sub $1,000 a month. They are not on contract but are on will contractors. So are they at-will employees, or are they contractors despite not signing a contract? I do not know. There should be room for salaried and contributors with each CU entity restructure. Whether or not the DAO delegates and MKR holders want absolute transparency and proof of integrity, that will create oversight CUs. This creation will be specifically for accounting, AppSec, or other functions. If not, there must be requirements for each CU to handle oversight in-house by themselves to a degree. How much granular transparency and integrity checking do you want to set up, and how? Am I hitting the mark there?    37:35  Unknown: First, we will need an accounting CU no matter what we decide. When someone comes to any CU and provides a budget request, do I or anyone else in the DAO have any business saying? Well, why are you spending 30,000 on travel or 40,000 on hardware? We can pick out individual elements and ask why it is so high? Suppose these contractors provide a service that we renew by giving them more money every quarter. In that case, it does not matter how they spend it as long as they deliver the results that we feel warrant giving them more money the next quarter. My question is, how centralized do we want the oversight of the budget to be? This is unusual for me to be on this side of the spectrum of less bandwidth for the DAO and probably less liability for both parties. These are all legal entities, for the most part, that are providing services to the DAO. They also have employees. We should clarify this because if people waste money but still deliver on what their bottom line is worth, it is not our business if they are contractors.  David Utrobin: Do you, as the delegate, want CU to have efficient spending and some function to call people out? Although it is micromanaging to some level, it is not wrong to have some function for efficiency. Sorry for going out in turn; I saw Nadia has her hand up, but I wanted to bounce back off that.    39:27  Nadia: From a legal perspective, we are all contractors because if we want employees, we should incorporate companies in each country where the employees are. At least, that was what I had to do with my career in it. We are incorporated, we have a legal entity, but I can not have employees. I wanted to do that; I will need to hire these people worldwide, which makes no sense. How I manage the expenses is difficult. I agree with all of you. I have 12 people in my CU. My payments go to different partners and campaigns, creating content and organizing events. It sometimes is insane.  I hired an accountant who is helping me with that. Every time I make a transaction, I have to fill everything in a spreadsheet, which allows me to keep organized. Then, I can present that information in the format I want. It is missing an agreement on what the Maker community expects from the CU regarding how we show our expenses. I do it in one way, and every CU does its way. I like Ace and the Real World CU\u2019s initiative in asking for all our expenses, creating a unified vision for costs. I want to know what the community thinks about this and how they want access to our expenses. Presently, when I close a month, I post the growth updates in the profits and losses. I am planning to do it at the end of the year. I will return the remaining budget to the DAO. We should at least agree with all the CUs to do the same.    42:58  Sebastien: We have discussed it a lot, and that is to dive into many problems. If we want to go into the details, I have recorded it, and we spend a lot of time getting all the invoices. We can check if you buy a pen and surprise, the pen was too high or too low. I have done a lot of that in the past, and it is not that useful. I agree that you are paying someone to do something, and what matters is if you get the result. Getting the results is not easy because we have over 20 Core Units. We do not know much. If we take every individual in this call, we do not see what everyone is doing, so we are not tracking. However, that is all, and it should be reasonably simple. In my Core Unit, it is quite easy.  We have seven with some part-time. Everyone sends an invoice adjusting an amount or proof of spending something else on their work. I then reimburse everything. It is seven payments per month, so it is not that much. If I need to pay for something, I will use my bank account for my company to pay for it then I reimburse myself at the end. I see that everyone is freelance, but you can analyze all the expenses in detail. You may also analyze what was spent and over budget to give a more precise view of our expenses as a DAO. For instance, there was 2 million upfront that was not recurring. We should tell the community that while we did have a lot of expenses this month, it will not continue. At some point, Mark did a great analysis showing that the cost run rate is half of what we have currently. It may feel like we are spending a lot, but we spent half of that. It is not expensive to have this information, which is super helpful. We have difficulty knowing how much is we are spending on each strategic initiative of MakerDAO. The question at the end of the year is how much of the budget of MakerDAO we spent on Real World assets? For all coins? If it\u2019s only 1%, it is not a strategic initiative. If we spend 10%, that is a strategic initiative. That allows you to see if that is interesting or strategic for the DAO. It is not easy to ask how much Dai was spent on assets; this is quite complex.    46:19  David:  I was going to disagree with you on one point. I agree with a lot of what you said, but the cost of an initiative is not necessarily tied to its impact. You could have very high-cost low impact initiatives, and you can have very low-cost high-impact initiatives.  Derek: I would pick up a comment on the sidebar referring to Core Units regarding them as profit entities. I do not think they are. At least in my case, everything will have to be or is declared as either being put forward to a cost center, an individual, a third party, an auditor, or returned. We do not have strict rules in place about the returns. Instead, we have these loose agreements. As Nadia said, we will do an end-of-year audit and return the funds. Part of the problem is that this is not explicitly specified. We were all working towards that. I do not think all units are for-profit entities. At the end of the year, we do not expect a surplus of any sort. If we do, we put that into the emergency budget, which will require a discussion. I agree with people having expectations. I\u2019ll leave it at that. You are onto something there that having formalized agreements and expectations is vital.    48:54  839\u00d7416 40 KB   David: I will skip prompt two because I failed to realize that Thomas Flitter, who led an information output audit that our team was doing, is not here. I wanted him to speak a bit about these products. I am happy to table this for another time. Here is the gist. Outside of budgeting, accounting, and reporting, there is a level of communication that stakeholders expect to access your team at a certain level. They want to see what your team is doing to understand the story and the progress function. The third prompt that I had was about cross-functional initiative coordination. We have about 18 CUs working on a broad range of initiatives, sub-initiatives, and sub-sub initiatives. Over the last year, we have been operationally and internally working towards greater efficiency and tracking. We have seen many different tools emerge, like the shared holiday sheet to put up their absences. We also have a cross-functional initiative tracker covering our mandated actors\u2019 calls and going through line by line. We will also be mapping out initiatives and who needs those initiatives. Who needs the sub-sub initiatives? We will also try to document everything to have clear expectations across the board. People have mentioned that one big concern is efficiency in our operations. I think getting to be very efficient as a decentralized organization with various independent CUs. I want to report what it is like from the inside. The pain points, from my perspective, are just the fact that these tools are not to the level that they should be yet, but we are early in making them.  LongForWisdom: Recently, we have been looking into greater detail the SCS initiative to make the cross-functional coordination more effective. It has worked in the past but excludes not explicitly Core Unit facilitators.  There is some debate about including people working on the front ends that support Maker in some of these meetings, which could be helpful. However, it is also strange because they are not technically part of the organization. This strangeness stems from the fact that membership of a DAO is fuzzy. To have these cross-functional initiatives effective, you need to make the meetings and communications transparent and public, if possible. In some cases, that is not possible, making it harder to ensure everyone gets the information you need.    53:03  David: One big concern we had inside the mandated actors meeting months ago was that we did not know who led these major initiatives. We do not have a singular coordination call for many of them; we have this one big call per week where all the facilitators gather and work through blockers, dependencies, and the next steps. It is hard to scale 18 teams and eight different initiatives. Underneath those eight, there are 64 sub-sub initiatives. A big part of the challenge, with exclusive access, is who goes on a mandated actress call. Is it just facilitators? Or is it facilitators, plus key coordinators, and product leads? The Gov Coms team has been working with SES, Derek, and the different engineering teams to figure out how to map these initiatives. Furthermore, how do these maps include the relevant stakeholder groups? Other relevant people are within the coordination effort or track these initiatives or sub initiatives. If it is just your team, you are in an echo chamber. Suppose you are not sharing the information about your coordination calls somewhere publicly or doing proactive outreach to people outside of your group. In that case, you will not have effective feedback loops or solution design conversations. You will increase the risk for what you are building, and it will not be the right thing. In general operations, we want to open up these initiatives to relevant stakeholders to join in these conversations, coordination calls, documentation, or whatever it might be. The first step has to be this full flesh out the picture. There must be a fully synced-up agreement on the map of the initiatives. You must understand who the leads are and then continuously identify relevant people. Our team is creating a stakeholder database and an internal one that includes CU and delegates, members of media, and integrators. It is a pretty incomplete database at the moment. We also used that database to map out the stakeholder ecosystem. Who are the actual stakeholders? Who are the front ends, keepers, auction participants, and Oracles? Whom are the people pushing those sets or the new software? There is a whole web of stakeholders outside of our little CU and the delegated MKR voter bubble. This is important because our keepers, Dai users, and vault users are our business. They need some ability level to come in and see what is going on to give practice feedback.  56:45  Derek: To give a real example, you and I have been working with other stakeholders on L2. Sam, Chris, Bartek, and others in the team in PE are working on layer two. However, that work has a lot of dependencies with other potential L2s with the stock net group, integrations, and groups of possible SCS integration. Their keepers may also have interfaces. What we are trying to do is prevent having an in-group and out-group. As David said, we want to open this L2 discussion to the broader community and build it up. What are our targeted releases and growth? When can we expect to do the marketing work around these initiatives? What does it mean for other L2s? We had a meeting last week where we walked through the key deliverables. We agreed. We had people from Nadia\u2019s group deliver their thoughts and ideas around the fast withdrawals, the Dai wormhole, and MCT on L2. This built up a picture of a high-level roadmap of what we want to deliver. Then, we broke that roadmap down into its constituent parts, put timelines against it, and estimated against that. That work helps map things out for the broader community. We still want to roll that information up to the actors\u2019 mandate and have that more broadly known and available to the community. As David said, everyone should be in the loop about what this is delivering when we expect it, the dependencies, and the risks. Are we putting in money where we should be? Do the objectives line up with what we initially set out? As Will said, we want that bridge-building to be visible for everyone involved. So, that is my little spiel, and we are working on it. I hope to open that up to the community. We can do that, back over to you guys.  59:12  David Utrobin: I want to echo what Will said in the chat; as a collective, we do not realize that ops risk equals reputation in an open organization like ours. A big focus of the culture and mind share of Maker has been on the financial risk and the aspect of technical risk. But in any business, there is also operational risk. The way that we mitigate these operational risks is through good coordination. When coordination fails, the products fail. That is when bottlenecks and delays happen. That is when six months of work gets thrown out the window because you did not talk to the person beforehand. You just wasted all the resources you invested - just my thoughts on this.  1:00:26  Eric Richards: Regarding operational communication, I just wanted to make a quick comment on collateral offboarding. With the recent offboarding, I will speak on my personal, real-world experience with Aave. About a quarter of outstanding Dai was from my Aave vaults. I was gone for the weekend, then popped on the forums to search for Aave. I do not generally jump into many signal forums, but nothing came up about offboarding when I searched Aave. The position was closed, or the vote happened quickly, with the ratio ticking up fast. I was liquidated without a penalty, which is great. But at the same time, it does not offer much time for the position change, especially when I was trying to support an asset that was a smaller portion of Maker since Black Friday. This was a six-figure loss that got triggered. I was throwing up for two days, and I was gone on a two-day weekend trip. I know Maker needs to decide to have something, but four days is relatively short. Before I left, I was checking my phone and DeFi savor. When I talked with Nickolaj from Defi Saver, he said when that happened, we did not even know what rates were coming up next. All my fail-safes failed right there. Now I am thinking, what can I do for Maker? I jump on the forum. As I dig in deeper, there is confusion around MATIC, seemingly with the operational units. I am not sure of precisely the coordination there. There is one vote on MATIC being offboarded in along with Aave. Suddenly, there is a chat about how MATIC will come up with its promises. Shortly after, there is another poll by Nick. Are we offboarding MATIC again? I am sitting here trying to figure out what asset I can get back into to make up for my losses. Honestly, I do not have faith in the protocol at this point because I only stepped away for four days when I had adequate fail-safe, and I was on my phone. In addition, with an asset like Aave, you have D3, which has a lot of protocol integration. From an outsider looking in, I am trying to use the platform. I have been an early supporter. I was on the call on Black Thursday and jumped into a vault shortly after, although I could not get the keeper up in time. I wanted to help the platform as best I could. Now I am sitting here on this column, not even knowing if I have enough for the dust limits if it gets increased too much. I also just got taken out. From an outsider\u2019s perspective reading the forums, the operational philosophy is a little confusing and disjointed, significantly when the hammer dropped as fast as it did. I have discussed that, but we do not have the time now. Thank you.  1:04:08  Unknown Speaker: We can all agree this was a terrible user experience, no matter how big the vault size was. And this come up before? We all recognize that it is not a great situation, particularly when you are not the first to go to our forums, look around, and not know. I ran into somebody last week that had a uni LP that got offboarded and was wandering around trying various Discord channels. I happened to see them and talk to them. We are all ears if you have suggestions about forums or communication venues that are more likely to be seen than what we are doing now. We recognize this as a problem we need to do better.

Another part of increasing the visibility of these meetings is the management of the public calendars at MakerDAO. In the last two months, the single MakerDAO public calendar for votes and calls was split into two parts: votes/important dates and calls. Part of the vision for increasing the operational efficiency and the visibility of these calls is to put many stakeholder alignment meetings on the actual public call calendar. A function should be provided in the description for outside stakeholders not directly invited to request an invite. This does not exist yet but is something that my team is envisioning. We are working with Bauder and others to do this. This is not like specifically for L2; this is can generally scale across different initiatives. That is the primary goal. We want to provide a framework that anybody can use and allows stakeholders to easily subscribe to a public calendar and filter (Ctrl F) what they are searching for.  1:25:19  845\u00d7450 126 KB   845\u00d7478 151 KB   845\u00d7475 148 KB   846\u00d7462 159 KB   Conclusion  LongForWisdom 1:32:54  LongForWisdom: Thank you for sharing that. Unfortunately, I must skip on questions, given the time, unless anyone has something very urgent and relevant. Wouter: The slides I added to this presentation will collect and post them as a separate forum thread.  David Utrobin: They are also posted already. People can access these slides live before the call. Keep that in mind for future joiners. Anybody here could check these slides out. They are usually updated right before the call. But all this stuff is currently available on the GNR Agenda forum post. Artem Gordon: The slides will also be on the snippets in about five minutes.   Wouter: I am happy to come on again next week to take any questions or comments.  LongForWisdom: All right, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We will hopefully see you all again soon.
