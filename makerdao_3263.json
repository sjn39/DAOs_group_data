Moving to xdai chain is essentially a vote that dPoS is sufficiently decentralized for smaller players and communities to use in exchange for nearly free transactions. xdai is also looking for new ways to improve security and decentralization, including optimistic bridging. The way that you could reduce SourceCred gas fees for distributions is by moving all funds on distribution day over to xdai in a single transaction before distributing to individual wallets.

Personally I find the fees on mainnet much too high for my needs and xdai security sufficient. But yeah, that should be a choice each user can make based on their own needs. I think for many small players fees on mainnet can eat 1% or more of their stack from gas alone in a single transaction (basic swaps on uniswap can easily be $100 these days, and more complex contracts or multi-step processes can be still more). That problem doesn\u2019t exist on xdai because transactions are essentially free. I can see why people with $1 M + would want to stay on mainnet. Even $100k+ I can see reasons why. But it\u2019s starting to become really difficult to justify doing anything on mainnet with less than 6 figures. And gas fees will only get worse from here for the foreseeable future. Matic is also an option. There is an xdai/matic bridge being built now. Many of these L2 solutions and sidechains will likely be bridged together in the coming months. ",

I agree\u2013something tells me that some of these \u201csidechains\u201d are going to become their \u201cown major chain\u201d once they get some traction. And if Major Exchanges, or Fintech Apps can allow Users to deposit Fiat directly to the \u201csidechain\u201d\u2013then there won\u2019t be a need for the average human to use base layer Ethereum (until we get ETH 2.0). So, yes these are some my concerns with regards to sidechains. Also, we should look to expanding adoption of DAI within other Layer 1s. I was just reading that TerraLuna\u2019s U.S. Terra (UST) stablecoin is accepting Solana, Polkadot, and StakedETH as collateral. All can be used as collateral to mint UST. The competition is getting thicker in the stablecoin ecosystem. ",
