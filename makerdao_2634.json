                    "content": "Hello!  I made some updates to MIP14 based on the informal poll to improve MIP14.  The takeaway was that MKR voters are not comfortable with token dilution at this time.  The updates to MIP14 were largely made to avoid FLOP auctions. One thing to add, during this process I learned that the protocol allows MKR holders to cause a FLOP at will, and MKR holders will ultimately be able to avoid MKR dilution if they wish Highlights of the changes: Added MIP14c4: Dai Transfer Ceiling. This would allow for MKR holders to set the maximum amount of DAI that can be transferred from the protocol in total using this process.  This ceiling would need to be raised by sub-proposal, adding another layer of FLOP security. Adding a surplus analysis section to the MIP14c2 sub proposal template, which would require sub proposals to declare whether a FLOP would likely occur due to DAI transfer Requiring Governance Facilitator(s) to communicate to the community that a FLOP would occur if the transfer proposal cannot be taken from the surplus PR: Updates to MIP14 by jtathmann \u00b7 Pull Request #84 \u00b7 makerdao/mips \u00b7 GitHub MIP14: Protocol DAI Transfer Preamble  MIP#: 14  Title: Protocol DAI Transfer  Author(s): @LongForWisdom, @jtathmann  Contributors: N/A  Type: Process  Status: Accepted  Date Proposed: 2020-05-12  Date Ratified: 2020-10-27  Dependencies: MIP0  Replaces: N/A   References MIP14c2-Subproposal-Template.md MIP14c4-Subproposal-Template.md Sentence Summary MMIP14 defines a generic process for transferring DAI from the Maker Protocol to a target Ethereum address. Paragraph Summary MIP14 defines a generic process for transferring DAI from the Maker Protocol to a target Ethereum address. This process is a fallback method of transferring value from the protocol in the event that a more specific process does not exist to do so. Component Summary MIP14c1: Considerations Regarding Protocol DAI Transfers A component which outlines the various considerations that should be made before transferring DAI out of the protocol using MIP14c2. MIP14c2: Protocol DAI Transfer Process A process component that allows Maker Governance to transfer DAI from the Maker Protocol to a target Ethereum address. MIP14c3: Protocol DAI Transfer List A list component that lists the previous direct DAI transfers that have been made by the protocol in the past. MIP14c4: Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling A process component that allows governance to define and modify the total amount of DAI that can be transferred from the protocol using MIP14. Motivation Giving governance the ability to use the value generated by the Maker Protocol is beneficial for two main reasons:   It allows Maker Governance to incentivize actions taken to improve the protocol.   It reduces Maker Governance\u2019s reliance on the Maker Foundation.   Less reliance on the Foundation moves the protocol towards decentralization. Creating a process to allow Maker Governance to spend the value accrued by the protocol empowers Maker Governance to build and improve the protocol in the future. Specification / Proposal Details MIP14c1: Considerations Regarding Protocol DAI Transfers There are several important considerations to take into account before transferring value out of the Maker Protocol.   Transfer of DAI from the protocol to an external address that is not controlled by Maker Governance is a one-way operation.   Transfer of DAI from the protocol will take DAI from the surplus buffer if available.   If there is insufficient DAI available in the surplus buffer unbacked DAI will be created and FLOP auctions will be able to be triggered immediately.   If there is a more specific process MIP that allows DAI transfers that is more appropriate to the use case, use that process instead.   MIP14c2: Protocol DAI Transfer Process MIP14c2 is a Process MIP component that allows Maker Governance to transfer DAI from the Maker Protocol to a target Ethereum address. Note that MIP14c2 subproposals are technical subproposals, they define executive code that transfers DAI from the Maker Protocol to one or more target addresses. If a MIP14c2 subproposal is Accepted, The DAI Transfer is appended to the list in MIP14c3 by a MIP Editor. MIP14c2 subproposals have parameters that depend on the total amount of DAI to be transferred (even if split among multiple target addresses) according to the following logic: < 10,000 DAI Transfer   Feedback Period:  0 full weeks   Frozen Period:  0 full weeks   10,000 - 100,000 DAI Transfer   Feedback Period:  4 full weeks   Frozen Period:  1 full week   > 100,000 DAI Transfer   Feedback Period:  12 full weeks   Frozen Period:  4 full weeks   If a MIP14c2 subproposal would result in a FLOP auction, Governance Facilitator(s) will use established communication channels to ensure the community is informed MIP14c2 subproposals must use the template located at  MIP14c2-Subproposal-Template.md . This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status. MIP14c3: Protocol DAI Transfer List This list can be amended through subproposals created under MIP14c2. List Entry Template  Entries into this list should follow the following template:  Reason:  Sub-proposal Number: #  Date Ratified: (yyyy-mm-dd)  Amount Transferred:  Recipient Address:  Total DAI Processed by MIP14 to date:    Historical Transfer List There are currently no historical transfers. Below is an example transfer which should be removed (as should this paragraph) when the first ratified transfer is added to this list .  Reason: Funding Chocolate for Governance Facilitators  Sub-proposal Number: MIP14c1-SP0  Date Ratified: 2020-02-30  Amount Transferred: 1,000,000 DAI  Recipient Address: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000  Total DAI Processed by MIP14 to date: 1,000,000   MIP14c4: Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling MIP14c4 sets the maximum amount of DAI that can be transferred in total from the protocol using this process. MIP14c2-subproposals will not be eligible if they cause the historic amount of DAI transferred from the protocol to exceed the ceiling, which will be initially set to 250,000 DAI and can be modified by MIP14c4 subproposal DAI Transfer Ceiling Adjustment   Feedback Period:  4 full weeks   Frozen Period:  1 full week   ",

Some feedback:     Jtathmann:  MIP14c4: Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling   This is an interesting idea, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing others thoughts on it. Some comments on implementation:  If MIP14c4 is a process component (ie you can create subproposals using it) then it should have a defined feedback and frozen period. The ceiling and total amount transferred should be recorded somewhere, probably in the MIP itself. Formatting-wise there should probably be a newline after the MIP14c4 title. I\u2019d be tempted to reword the component summary slightly. Maybe: \u2018A process component that allows governance to define and modify the total amount of DAI that can be transferred from the protocol using MIP14\u2019  I actually quite like this idea. MIP14 was always planned to be a generic fallback to be used when a more specific process doesn\u2019t exist. Putting a cap on how much it can be used seems like a good way to encourage people to propose better processes for specific cases. Other changes just seem like generally good inclusions. ",

Aaron_Bartsch:  focused and efficient process for distribution of funds   For this I\u2019m more referring to repeating and expected expenses, funding domain teams, potentially paying for SourceCred.
