It would be interesting if OP Grant council had to use a Tally time lock contract to distribute OP via on-chain voting between sub-committee members. just a thought. Anyway great to see Tally contribute to Optimism governance! ",

First step would probably be to fund seasons via an on-chain proposal from the Token House. From there, it could make sense to deploy the Grant Council as a sub-DAO and execute individual grants as on-chain proposals as well. It would bring a lot of additional transparency and security to the process. Cheers! ",
