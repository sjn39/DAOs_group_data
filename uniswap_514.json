However, since there is quite a bit of competition out there, and growing, it may be worth getting some of it back, to hedge for the future. Has anyone thought about incentivizing lets say the 4 original pools again with UNI, but, only for LPs as of a certain date, prior to the release of V3 of Uniswap.  Since we don\u2019t know the date of the release of version 3, a proposal stating something to the effect that, these rewards are only available to addresses that were LPs one month prior to the release of version 3.  That way, liquidity may be tempted to be brought back to Uniswap, and remain there for some time, since the provider may not want to miss out on being eligible for the rewards, and, not knowing the date of the release of V3, keeps the liquidity there, since it is unknown. The rewards would only start upon the release of V3.  The exact amount of the rewards is up for debate. ",

I didn\u2019t see this suggestion in that thread, and, being that no proposal has even been put forward for a vote from prior threads, perhaps a new angle might be worth discussing. ",
