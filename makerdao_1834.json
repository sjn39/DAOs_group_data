                    "content": "  The Viridian Cluster - Protector MetaDAO Application We would like to introduce the Viridian Cluster, and what we\u2019d like to accomplish, should the Cluster be onboarded to a Protector Metadao, and, pending approval of the Endgame Plan. The Protector MetaDAO, that the Viridian Cluster would onboard to, would follow the Endgame rules and be fully decentralized from its creation. MetaDAO token holders will have complete decision making power on all decisions and the MetaDAO tokens will be broadly distributed to anyone who wishes to farm them with DAI, ETH or MKR.  WHO? So far the Viridian Cluster is a small circle. With time it might expand, but the intention is to keep the core team as lean as possible, and rather pass work on to the arrangers, the community and third-party professionals to help expand.     Role Person     Facilitator @Hajive   \u201cSwiss Army Knife\u201d Financier @SebVentures   Legal DeFi/TradFi Genius to be announced - already filled   DAO & Community Wizard recruiting   Global Impact Expert recruiting   Arranger I Monetalis/ @Allan_Pedersen / @Wrongcomma    Arranger II to be announced    The team above generally consists of persons who have worked together previously productively within and outside of Maker - and, importantly, share a common outlook and vision.   SIDEBAR: THE MAKER & PROTECTOR METADAO \u201cDEAL\u201d IN BRIEF To set the scene, it is important to understand the key elements of the \u201cdeal\u201d between a Protector MetaDAO & Maker. This operational/deal link is not entirely operationalised today, but we believe, to our best understanding, that is can be simply understood to work in the following way in short-form (but please understand this is Work-in-Progress):   The Protector MetaDAO must deliver an RWA portfolio to Maker that can support a 1:1 USD peg. This means Maker sets (and tests for - say bi-annually) a range of requirements on the portfolio in respect of liquidity, loss probability, market-value variability, Surplus capital, Loss absorbing external capital etc etc. I.e. the Protector MetaDAO essentially delivers a portfolio that could - independently - be seen as a stablecoin backing portfolio. (this \u201chard frame\u201d of Maker Core requirements are \u201cin the works\u201d)   Maker benchmarks the Protector MetaDAO against [US Treasury 3-months]. This means the Protector MetaDAO must deliver alpha/spread against this benchmark (and meet the above \u201chard frame\u201d requirements).   The Protector MetaDAO, as its core revenue from Maker, receives [10%] of yield income up-to the benchmark - and [25%] of all yield above the benchmark.   This revenue, and other income sources (such as frontend revenue share fees that are available to all MetaDAOs), go directly to the Protector MetaDAO Surplus Buffer (\u201cPMSB\u201d).   The PMSB is entirely governed by the MetaDAO token holders - and all budgets, spending etc must be approved by token holders.   The Protector MetaDAO is able to return value to Protector MetaDAO token holders by using funds in the PMSB to acquire Elixir (DAI/ETH/MKR liquidity provider tokens). The accumulated Elixir tokens are used to slowly buy and burn Protector MetaDAO tokens, and increase the Protector MetaDAOs share of MKR Emissions (Metanomics). Importantly, when a Protector MetaDAO acquires Elixir, it must do so in a ratio of 70% Elixir and 30% ETHD, and the ETHD holdings of the Protector MetaDAO is used to rent additional decentralized junior capital from external depositors. This value transmission mechanism is under the control of Maker Core - i.e. the Protector MetaDAO acquires Elixir and the split/yield etc to DAI/ETH/MKR holders is handled by Maker Core.   The Debt Ceiling of the Protector MetaDAO Vault is firstly defined by the aggregate size of the Adopted Vaults and thereafter on a quarterly basis by the Maker Core RWA Collateral Scope based upon portfolio review and next quarters plan for onboardings of new collateral and reallocations of current portfolio\u2019s collateral in response to market changes.      WHAT?  976\u00d7103 23.3 KB  On the most basic, yet very important, level, the Viridian Cluster wishes to support Maker growth and DAI stability by developing a universal portfolio that matches Maker\u2019s financial/collateral requirements - fundamentally we believe this is best done by solving for Max yield under Maker determined constraints such as liquidity, loss probabilities, market value variability, reputation etc. However, global asset management today has USD 100+ Trillion AuM - allocated across a myriad of different investment strategies and assets, the number of which only growing (fx. in US alone, 457 new ETF products were issued in 2021 - and new technology and business models produce new forms of credit-risks every single day). This means the above core \u201cmax yield\u201d equation can be solved in many, many different ways - ways that only will increase with time. And that\u2019s where it gets interesting in our view. Because we, at the Viridian Cluster, want to solve the above equation AND make a positive impact on the world and in areas that have synergistic positive combination effects. We have identified two areas where we would want to try and contribute to making a positive global impact:  934\u00d7187 58.2 KB  The question is how do we, through our choice and implementation, create \u201cMax Impact per dai\u201d, in these two large scale, complex problems?  HOW?  Max Yield Equation The first equation: Max Yield under certain financial parameter constraints is a complex problem, but broadly solved adequately on a daily basis in the global investment industry. It is a skill that can be acquired via Arrangers and partnerships with global investment industry players. The \u201chow\u201d on the element is well-trodden and understood. The 5 starting individuals in the core of this cluster all have experience from the financial industry and are well equipped with the knowledge and skills to orchestrate and marshall the resources of the Arrangers and third-parties in a way that safe-guard and advances the MetaDAO.  976\u00d7295 82.7 KB   Max Impact Equations The much more open question is how to generate max impact per dai. And this is the area in which the Viridian Cluster hopes to strongly engage with the community. We have, to get started, identified some first iteration, high-impact operational ideas to start with, but hope to work with the community on this:  I/ Contribute to Arresting Climate Change:   Set a clear, simple and strong standard for Climate Change investing that makes sense for the Protector MetaDAO community - and engage with relevant institutions/NGOs etc on evolving the standard. This adds our voice to the conversation about what is Climate Change investing.   Focus investing in credit portfolio build-ups and seeding/encouraging asset strategies that meet this Community-based Climate Change standard - and resell as they meet an institutional threshold. This way we help accelerate the development of institutional Climate Change Assets in the world and get them to market.   Open up the above investment strategies of credit portfolio build-up and seeding investment strategies for like-minded third-parties to participate to grow the base of investors participating in accelerating these important assets.    976\u00d7295 87.8 KB  We want to make an important point on the topic of Arresting Climate Change: Over the past year, as we have been exploring climate change investing in various ways, we have clearly found that a genuine focus on this topic opens many doors with high-quality TradFi partners otherwise hard to reach. For some it is even becoming a requirement to be at least certified to a certain level (UN PRI etc). If you then additionally consider that this is an asset class in its infancy, but with large growth potential, then the simple financial basis for chosing to focus on this Impact Area becomes easy: it bring access to extra partners, new instruments and growth - all available for the Viridian Cluster to exploit.  II/ Contribute to Integration of DeFi/CeFi/TradFi:   Engagement with the regulators on finding a true north that is based upon gainful and safe integration between DeFi/CeFi/TradFi. More on this in our Regulatory/Legal section   DeFi/CeFi integration. In a combination of legal and technical projects we aim to find the best way to integrate between the decentralised crypto environment and the centralised/regulated crypto environment. We foresee the most interesting and powerful projects connected to realising max value from crypto in assets/investment will increasingly primarily appear in regulated, ring-fenced, CeFi environments. How can DeFi productively integrate with this? This means, initially, developing legal structures that can be governed by smart-contracts, working appropriately with self-custody environments, developing smart-contract integration with regulated asset custodians and regulated digital asset markets. This ensures DeFi can continue to stay relevant and don\u2019t get left behind a CeFi market growing.   CeFi/TradFi integration. What TradFi instruments and structures can gainfully be tokenized/digitised and operated in a CeFi environment? This will be rather directed by our mandate from Maker and by the Climate Challenge Impact concept, but generally is intended to develop assets in CeFi that actually have productive differences and advantages over their TradFi \u201ccousins\u201d. We can already see the industry trend developing here, as an example the community will be familar with and SG-Forge and their OFH token bond issuance natively on Ethereum. The advantage often are found in some combination of liquidity, atomic exposure, transaction time, control and cost. Capital Markets are fast and unforgiving - and move fast to most effective asset structures - and so CeFi we support must produce conclusive tangible advantages.   Create Cash flow growth in \u201cgood\u201d patterns of integration. We simply advance these models of integration and assets by ensuring the capital controlled by the Protector MetaDAO  flows through these models - and allow third-parties to use our \u201chigh-speed high-way\u201d for moving between TradFi/CeFi/DeFi (maybe with a little toll-booth on it\u2026)    976\u00d7252 88.6 KB  At the Viridian Cluster we are not expecting to have more than 5 team members (long-term perhaps a few more), and so these contributions are expected to be achieved in practice via third-parties, partners and Arrangers as part of the asset allocation/management relationships - and hopefully also via the Protector MetaDAO community. Simply, all else being equal, we\u2019d suggest the Protector MetaDAO would value asset allocation proposals from arrangers and partners that moves the Protector MetaDAO forward on above Contribution areas higher than those that don\u2019t (in an everything else being equal situation). That way we create global change. We want to end with this equation:  976\u00d7112 33.4 KB  We believe the 3 core activities outlined are multiplicative in creating max value for the Viridian Cluster Protector MetaDAO - not just additive. One activity aids and expands another etc.  Projects & Vault Adoption Above may still seem abstract, so here are the stable of projects that the Viridian Cluster team have worked on with (initially) Monetalis to start building a foundation for a Protector MetaDAO. This, hopefully, show we are a resourceful team and able to operationalise these concepts and strategies into real life application:  ONBOARDING PROJECTS     Project Partner & Content Outcome Pursued     ClydesdaleMIP65 SygnumBlackrock ETFBaillie GiffordUS treasury & Corp Bond portfolio Low risk, highly liquid yieldOpen-up asset class and partners for further deployment options for MakerCreate partner entry points for our 2 impact areas   AppaloosaMIP82 CoinbaseOver-collateralized Loan High liquid/strong yield and over-collateralised with eth/btc with custodian - i.e. no market value variabilityCreate tighter connection with key CeFi partners (Coinbase/Anchorage/etc)   AndalusianMIP89 Arrow GlobalCredit FundSenior, Secured Lending in the UK/EU Private Market lending with strong partner for UK/EUFoundational in building climate change assets and creating asset flow in private credit and diversify asset base into EuropePursues Tokenization & listing   FriesianMIP88 Redwood TrustRMBS Issuer in the USA Structured Credit in the US with strong partnerSimilarly foundational in building climate change assets in a key classOpen to Tokenization   OldenburgerMIP next cycle BlackRockGlobal Gov Bonds Developing Climate Change Overlay on a Government Bond Strategy.Develop own fund product with strong partner to put to marketDevelop an asset to offer to the world     ONBOARDING SUPPORT PROJECTS     Project Partner & Content Outcome Pursued     Flash Flash Liquidity Project.

Portfolio Construction under way and filings for fund setup.   Pharos Asset Allocation Template & Reporting Establish a framework for asset allocation and reporting.    It is worth noting that the above set of projects delivers a platform for a Protector MetaDAO where the DAO have access to a rather vast universe of assets with high-quality partners in both US and Europe.  Protector MetaDAO Value Creation? We see the Protector MetaDAO value creation mechanism as being entirely overlapping with conventional valuation thinking (i.e. create max future distributable cash-flows). How it is then transmitted to the various token holders via Elixir, buy and burn of MetaDAO tokens and MKR emissions, we leave to Maker Core. So, initially, just focusing on the \u201cportfolio building job\u201d for MakerDAO, the Protector MetaDAO could - purely from a valuation point of view - be best estimated as an \u201cAsset Manager type operation\u201d. Value in this type of business is driven by i) size of assets managed, ii) the underlying attractiveness of the investment strategies pursued/their earnings power (i.e. US treasuries vs Private Equity is a big difference in revenue and income generation) and iii) relative competitive position. As the portfolio built for Maker is focused on low risk, low volatility, high liquidity assets, one shouldn\u2019t expect to see much \u201cstrategic attractiveness premium\u201d on that account initially.  So we can do some basic valuation maths using the relative market valuation factors for Asset Managers you can see here in the graph above.     Protector MetaDAO A B     AuM 2B 10B   V(AuM)=2%xAuM 40M 200M   RevenueAssume: Yield:4.5% & US Tres:3%Rev=(3%xAuM)x10%+(1.5%xAuM)x25% 13.5M 67.5M   EBIT ~10M ~60M   V(EBIT)=12xEBIT 120M 720M    You will note a discrepancy between earnings vs AuM valuation basis because Maker is more generous in yield-sharing than would be the case for this type of asset class. The \u201cefficient market\u201d would probably value this somewhere in-between. Please note it doesn\u2019t factor in surplus reserving requirements or the margin effect of such reserves potential for further risk appetite. So there you have reason 1 for holding a Protector MetaDAO token under the Viridian Cluster strategy: if you believe in the growth of the DAI and its continued allocation towards RWA, then this MetaDAO has some rapid basic valuation mechanics in it to match this growth. In addition to the above conventional valuation, the actual value of the token in the marketplace will be directly affected by the Metanomics that allows the Protector MetaDAO a share of the 60,000 yearly MKR emissions. But we shouldn\u2019t forget the exponential strategic value creation potential coming from the two areas of in which the Viridian Cluster intends to make a global impact:  Climate Change: Accelerator of Climate Change Assets Manufacturing The world\u2019s asset holders remain starved for true, impactful, Climate Change assets. Using the (limited) heft of a Protector MetaDAO\u2019s initial mandate of Maker to establish a machine to manufacture these assets will deliver substantial franchise value from premium on assets to the application of this machinery broadly to global investors: i.e. higher margins on assets and substantially further revenues from more assets and higher asset velocity (building & resell).  DeFi/CeFi/TradFi Integration: Building a Highway Paving a performing high-way that integrates digitally from DeFi to TradFI will have substantive value - the toll-booths the Protector MetaDAO can install on the high-way have potential to generate massive cash flow as these markets integrate. There will not be many of these high-ways and first-movers working collaboratively across will, likely, have sticky advantages in terms of trust and size that is not easily supplanted. This is a many billion dollar opportunity that we think will come to fruition a lot faster than the TradFi world might think (or wish for): regulatory pressure is on and technology seems sufficiently mature - it needs orchestration and collaboration - and very likely flood-gates will open. The value of getting this roughly right will be many multiples of what can be achieved from our first-level conventional valuation attempt.  Strategy with self-reinforcing cycles that accelerates & solidify Competitive Position Overall - at the Viridian Cluster we have tried to develop the above strategy to have self-reinforcing mechanisms. Better regulatory relationships \u2192 better and more willing TradFi partners \u2192 easier to work with regulators and ability to expand asset toolbox \u2192 more revenue \u2192 better solution\u2192 etc etc. So - as Protector MetaDAO token holder under Viridian Cluster strategy - you could say your \u201cdown-case\u201d valuation lies around the simple \u201casset management type\u201d valuation explored initially plus the annual share in MKR emissions to the Protector MetaDAO   - and the \u201cupside option\u201d lies in how successful, and big a player, the Viridian Cluster Protector MetaDAO could become in climate change asset creation and in building a sensible DeFi/CeFi/TradFi highway. The graph here illustrates value (based on the fact that ultimately everything slows down as mass grows - and nothing grows to infinity).  936\u00d7598 50.4 KB   The Viridian Cluster Practical Approach to DAO & Regulations We believe in the DAO model and we believe there is a place of productive peace and collaboration/integration between DeFi/CeFi/TradFi. However, clearly, this place is not easily identified today and so, as a DAO operating with substance in the \u201creal-world\u201d, one has the risk of running afoul of current and prospective regulations, political winds and erratic enforcement. There is unfortunately no panacea for this situation, but we believe the following simple set of rules is the most productive at this moment:   Stay firmly a true DAO Governance MetaDAO tokens must be held as widely as possible and be in control of decision-making. The Viridian Cluster team provides analysis and decision-making material for this decision-making. We must stay decentralised.   Keep operations open and transparent This remains the principle defence against DAO mechanisms breaking down - and helps provides substantial comfort with regulators (and public)   Pursue engagement with Regulators & political law-forming environments Primarily focused on the key jurisdiction where real-world interactions are taking place. Communicate clearly:  The intention to operate as a DAO** The clear public good outcomes of the DAO\u2019s mission A crystal clear willingness to comply with regulations as/when they arrive An interest in helping in education, debate and design of any such regulations Clearly promote the DAO\u2019s transparent reporting instruments that allows any regulator to monitor the DAO.    Comply with regulations and requirements when acting in the real-world with incorporated entities.   \u201cStay out of trouble\u201d Basically don\u2019t take short-cuts, play nice with partners and customers etc\u2026 Let no third-party have a good reason to complain about you to anyone.   We believe this is the best approach for staying true to the DAO vision and operating in the real-world. It should give us the best \u201cpure DAO operating space\u201d for the longest possible time and be in the right positions to evolve over time as regulators and laws get a handle on how to work with a DAO and with crypto.  Spirit of the Viridian Cluster  Pragmatism & Compromise to achieve forward movement and progress Action & Results > A Ton of Words Institutional Quality Workmanship Scientific Method approach and Fact-based debate Transparency and openness Entrepreneurial outlook and approach Aspire to act always with integrity, decency and compassion   The Viridian Cluster Community engagement format? Hopefully, from above, it should be clear that the Viridian Cluster is straight-forward action oriented and would intend to engage with the community in similar fashion. We hope to work with tools such as dework.xyz and place work-tasks, requests for thoughts, opinions etc to gain direct community engagement, opinions and efforts into the practical, day-to-day, Viridian Cluster work for the Protector MetaDAO. We believe this approach will ensure a much tighter coherence between community and cluster - and lead to a more resilient and productive Protector MetaDAO. Beyond the above, the Viridian Cluster will follow the gold standard community engagement blueprints already built by MakerDAO of course.  What\u2019s Next? In the next coming weeks we intend to deliver:  Expense Budget for the Viridian Cluster Announce team members and further partners Key work-processes details Financial Model for Value Creation Considerations Further details on Projects - we will try to set them up in Dework.xyz as a trial Metanomics Considerations  \u2026and now we welcome questions/comments!

                    "content": "First of all really happy to see this Cluster announcement. From my perspective the simple way to understand this is that it provides a simple, overcollateralized D3M wrapper around many of the high potential but complicated RWA deals we are currently considering, and more that will keep coming. Instead of having to think about all of these deals individually and rely on advice from people who, while smart and trustworthy, ultimately have no skin in the game, we can use Protectors to outsource all of the individual decisions and marginal risk taking to an overcollateralized, fully decentralized structure that has its own redundant checks and balances following the same best practice as Maker, but with self-selected token holders, lean and specialized workforce and, crucially, a community meta that focuses exactly on being able to make decentralized governance for RWA work. We eliminate most governance overhead, get rid of most expenses and human relationships, and establish a protective buffer of decentralized junior capital that is under the physical control of Maker Governance. The cost is that we give away a portion of the yield, but Maker has always preferred scale over margin. Additionally, we also get to yield farm the tokens that capture this value to our own users and to MKR holders. The upside will really start to show if we can get more than one successful Protector online so they can compete properly and establish a transparent marketplace with competitive pressure towards pushing the standards on risk mitigation and safe yields. This would allow Maker Governance to not have to worry so much about making absolute decisions about the One True Way to do RWA, but instead just look retroactively at relative performance of multiple different teams and then rebalance based on where the actual results on the ground that we like to see are showing up.     luca_pro:  Does this mean a member of the DAO, @SebVentures, has been for the last months working to analyse and bootstrap an external counterparty with which, at the same time, was under (business) negotiations to join forces in a new (yet not voted) MetaDAO construct? And no little task either. Same could be said about @Hajive \u2013 yet in a way less critical position.   Understanding and securing the risk inherent in the relationships and checks and balances between the professional actors that interact with Maker Governance is critical, and it is really the main challenge MetaDAOs and the Endgame Plan aim to deal with. Maker has had so much drama and trouble in the recent past - especially with RWA - precisely because relationships, politics and checks and balances becomes such a major issue once you reach the massive scale the Maker workforce has today (130+). The relationships between arrangers and internal teams in the MetaDAOs are the same as in Maker. So nothing changes in that regard and the relationships really just carry over with no modification. Internal MetaDAO teams, like Core Units, provide advice to the token holders that set up vaults with external arrangers. The whole point of MetaDAOs is to allow small groups of the people who actually work and communicate well together to be able to do their jobs without being forced to also work together with people they aren\u2019t compatible with, causing all the distracting drama that we all hate to see. The introduction of the MetaDAO as the simplified, and well capitalized, D3M point of contact adds even more security for Maker through better aligned incentives and new recourse methods. I would argue that there are two major incentive alignments that significantly benefits MKR holders in derisking and simplifying the relationships with the arrangers. The first is the token incentive and skin in the game of the internal teams. Currently, the Core Units have no skin in the game and if a deal they work on blows up they suffer no consequences - it is exactly the same as if someone elses deal blows up. In the MetaDAO construct the internal teams are paid in MetaDAO tokens, and those MetaDAO tokens are fully exposed as junior capital to the deals that these teams provide advice on. So we go from no skin in the game, to skin in the game. The second major factor is intangible, but also extremely important. Because the current major workforce is so massive, many of the Core Unit members don\u2019t particularly like or care about other members of the workforce, or even the community as something important or personal to them. This is just what happens when a project grows to such a massive size and a workforce grows to 100+ people (usually this happens already around 40-50 people, and that\u2019s better structured, centralized, colocated companies). You simply don\u2019t know who the other people are so you don\u2019t care about them or what they think to the same extent. This kind of environment quickly breeds mistrust and a general sense of \u201cother people in the workforce don\u2019t really care about the DAO, so why should I?\u201d. In a MetaDAO the teams are very small, and should never exceed an amount where people in the workforce stops knowing and remembering everyone else. This means that the culture and attitude is completely different, because membership in the workforce is now a personal thing. You know that the others are doing their best and that you can trust them, and you all share upside in the tokens that you are earning. This provides a much stronger incentive for the individual to then also do their best. This is also what I call good meta, and it\u2019s what MetaDAOs are all about.  Is this post a public solicitation to raise an equity investment in a business venture called \u201cViridian Cluster\u201d? Is this \u201cfarming\u201d you refer to similar to an NFT mint that will capitalize your business for paying operating expenses and delivering \u201cvalue\u201d to the holders of your MetaDAO tokens? Something like this: Bored Ape creators Yuga Labs faces probe by SEC over unregistered offerings: report - MarketWatch   Want to just clear up some misconceptions of this. First of all, a cluster is a group that\u2019s preparing to make an onboarding proposal to a future MetaDAO. It\u2019s not a MetaDAO project itself, or a group launching a token or anything like that. The Endgame Plan creates the MetaDAOs and distributes the MetaDAO tokens, and the clusters then make onboarding proposals to those MetaDAOs after they are created and have their tokens broadly distributed, enabling a decentralized governance process. Think of a cluster as a group announcing their intention to make a future Core Unit onboarding proposal (the SES incubation program which prepared and then resulted in core unit proposals are a good example of this being an established practice in Maker) Secondly, let me just explain yield farming simply. It is not minting, or an ICO, or selling tokens. It means distributing tokens for free to users of a DeFi product, and it is something that is actively being done, or has been done by basically all major DeFi protocols. Maker is really the only one that hasn\u2019t done it. This includes: Aave, Compound, Uniswap, Lido, Curve, Balancer, Yearn, etc etc. Literally everyone other than us does it or have done it because it is a proven way to bootstrap a diversified and decentralized community. And just to reiterate the above point, the way MetaDAOs work is that first Maker distributes the MetaDAO tokens through yield farming to Dai holders, ETH vault users, and MKR holders. Then the MetaDAO tokens become broadly distributed and can begin voting on decisions and running a decentralized governance process. The clusters can then make applications to these token holders through a process that\u2019s similar to our MIP39 Core Unit onboarding process in Maker, but done to the MetaDAO token holders, using the MetaDAOs own forum, own MIP set etc. They are basically mini-Makers and all of their functionality mirrors how Maker already has functioned for years.

                    "content": "Dear Kianga, I think Rune answered the endgame questions, but I am happy to say a bit about licensing/regulations. Now my take is from a potential Arrangers point of view. I will not be having MetaDAO tokens or be in the MetaDAO etc - I am on the outside trying to be as helpful as I can to move the Protector MetaDAO concept into something practical - be that as writer, as sparring partner or helping people get together in clusters - or whatever else is needed that I can contribute with - to get some forward movement and get to a point where Maker can realise its potential with RWA. Which is really the end-state, I, as a potential arranger, am most interested in getting to - ASAP please. The very short answer, for me, is that anything that happens in or between legal entities - and that I am involved in - will 1000% be appropriately licensed if required and all regulations met. There is simply no chance I can deliver the quality of partners and deals I want to deliver to the MetaDAO if I didn\u2019t make sure this was the case. KYC/AML/onboarding today with strong institutions are hypersensitive to anything related to crypto/DAO so we are always being vetted very thoroughly - and thus must have all i\u2019s dotted and t\u2019s crossed. What about the DAO\u2019s status you may ask. Well - I don\u2019t think there is a clear solid answer across the globe. When I helped write and discuss this Cluster application, we spoke to a good number of lawyers and experts in multiple jurisdiction to get many views on this - and the \u201crecipe\u201d set out in the document for how to act, as of today, seemed to be the best current compromise. But these things will change over time - and I would expect the MetaDAO team will facilitate the MetaDAO can adjust accordingly and ensure the MetaDAO stay on the right side of any relevant regulators and laws. Ultimately I have a lot of faith in the team, and so, I happen to believe they will help the MetaDAO make good choices on these things as changes happen. ",
