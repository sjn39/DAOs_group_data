NB: As a new user I can only submit one picture + 2 links, for full references, including gas optimizations, links to repos and graphical step-to-step flows, please see this post: https://medium.com/@Gfriiis/linkdrops-an-open-source-standard-for-invite-digital-asset-links-on-ethereum-29f34b3fa5ec  Core Assumptions  Bob is a new user without ETH, wallet or any prior crypto knowledge Alice has an EIP 1077 identity contract and a spare ERC721 Robot Alice share the invite link with Bob over a secure channel e.g Whatsapp There is an incentive in place (on a user, dapp or relay level) to pay gas   757\u00d7759 12.3 KB   Bob is a new user without ETH, wallet or any prior crypto knowledge Alice shares an invite link to Bob Link includes a transit private key and a signature Bob is directed to a webpage Bob generates his own private key stored in the browser Bob uses transit private key to sign Bob\u2019s address Bob\u2019s browser sends his two signatures to the relayer Relayer calls Alice\u2019s identity contract Alice\u2019s identity contract creates an identity contract for Bob and sends a Robot Bob is now onboarded to Ethereum and owns a robot that he can play with!   Modular implementation of linkdrops  Based on rich iterations, the implementation of the Universal Login SDK Alex van de Sande & Marek has undergone updates towards a modular architecture since Devcon 4. Below is the current draft of a simple modular version of Invite Scheme without generating an identity contract for receiver: The main function of the module is  transferTokensByLink ,  which:  Verifies 2 signatures (sender\u2019s and receiver\u2019s signatures) Checks that link wasn\u2019t used before (by storing transitPubKey in storage) Transfers tokens from sender\u2019s identity contract to receiver address  Sender\u2019s signature verification can be done using  owner.canExecute And for transferring tokens, we can use  owner.moduleExecute \u2014 Any feedback on how we can improve approve, highly appreciated!  React Native Starter Implementation  As we are actively working to implement linkdrops including invite link functionality into different mobile applications, we have developed this Universal Login React Native. Feedback highly appreciated   Requirements  NodeJS v10.12.0 Yarn 1.10.1  This starter has been tested only on OS X.  Dependencies This starter uses  react-native-navigation  (v1) for navigation. rn-nodeify  package allows to use node core modules. Native libs for secure and fast crypto:  react-native-secure-randombytes react-native-fast-crypto   Reducing Gas cost via Proxy delegation  In search of reducing the gas we decided research or proposed EIPs tackling this problem, with inspiration from best practices, such as Gnosis Safe, Tenzorum, Argent (https://www.argent.xyz/) and feedback from Pet3rpan from the #MetaCartel. Mikhail has proposed to reduce gas cost using proxy delegation.  Gasless implementation (without Universal Login integration) FInally the newest enhancement in this regard is below gassless webdapp prototype, which can be considered an enhancement to the #burner wallet by Austin Griffith. We hope to a demo of the wallet soon and learn about you feedback.   Cryptoxmas.xyz  a charity NFT reference implementation of linkdrops (without Universal Login integration)  Cryptoxmas.xyz: Send Christmas NFT cards & support Venezuelans in need Finally we have now found an application for the greater good, utilizing the linkdrop standard, the receiver only needs to click the link, and does not need to have an Ethereum wallet in advance. Excepts gas fees, every funds are sent to the Giveth Campaign Escrow contract. ",
