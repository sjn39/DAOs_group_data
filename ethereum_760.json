For reputation you could do some kind of Colony-like peer-assigned and review task-based system. The benefit would be accounting of non code-related tasks. It isnt sybil resistant, but you could potentially mitigate attacks/noise if there were recognized stakeholder groups that managed and reported contributions within their groups, and were then probably audited by other peer stakeholder groups. ex: magicians, cat herders, EF, Parity, Geth, maybe a union of open source contributors, etc. ",

Why not? and then come up with ways to measure contribution around all of the significant identified contribution types. but the point would be to start with what we consider valuable contribution.

We should definitely not be afraid to try our best to measure all the types of contributions that are relevant. Perhaps those in each field of Ethereum could maintain their own measuring systems, updating their part of the algo, much in the way that Google is constantly updating PageRank. ",

The subjectivity gets around the Goodhart-related problems which we get into when we use objective metrics. It can also be made somewhat sybil-resistant by limiting who gets a contribution score \u201cto start\u201d (i.e. we use objective github data to determine the \u201cstarting contribution distribution\u201d and then use the subjective endorsements to distribute the contribution scores beyond what the data themselves can capture). If someone creates a fake account, their endorsements have zero weight until someone endorses them. So not sybil-resistant per-se, but not trivially sybillable either. I like this idea because it is grounded in something objective (i.e. github contributions) but incorporates subjective information (endorsements) beyond what the objective can provide. It also means that we don\u2019t have to worry about capturing every objective signal as the subjective assessments will \u201csmooth out\u201d the gaps in what the metrics show. ",
