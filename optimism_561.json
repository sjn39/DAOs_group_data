With its innovative dual-token system inspired by the traditional stock and bond market, Swapline offers a sustainable and fair trading ecosystem for all users. Swapline is built on top of Liquidity Book, a highly efficient automated market-making system that allows traders to do large trades with zero slippage. Swapline is designed to simplify the Liquidity Book model for users with automated strategies and aims to provide \u201creal yield\u201d from trading fees rather than unsustainable boosted farm yields. This will enable liquidity providers to get higher real yield returns with less liquidity and traders to do limit order swaps with zero slippage and no fees. Swapline has developed an innovative dual token system (Token A & Token B - real names will be announced before launch) inspired by some characteristics of stocks and bonds in the traditional financial market. Token A is used to incentivize liquidity provisioning in automated vaults to bootstrap liquidity, while Token B is a limited governance token allowing the community to become part of the DAO and its business model. The innovative in-house developed smart contract ensures that upgrading Token A to Token B ensures that both are in balance with each other, making them more resilient to fluctuations in the crypto market. This makes Swapline an excellent choice for anyone looking for a real-sustainable yield, secure, and user-friendly DEX which provides trades with zero slippage and low fees. \u2014---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The overall vision of Swapline is to create the best possible decentralized exchange (DEX) for traders, liquidity providers, DAO members on Optimism. We strive to provide a user-friendly interface and a seamless trading experience that maximizes liquidity efficiency and no slippage and fees while providing real sustainable yield for our liquidity providers.  1500\u00d7750 90 KB  The overall vision from Swapline will be achieved by focusing on these six aspects:  Concentrated Liquidity  Swapline uses the concentrated liquidity book model, which enables liquidity providers to concentrate their liquidity around the current price range (bins) of an asset. This means that traders can execute large trades with minimal slippage, as there is a deep pool of liquidity available at the current price range.  Automated vaults  Swapline offers automated liquidity management through the use of vaults that can rebalance a liquidity provider\u2019s allocation as needed. This means that liquidity providers do not have to manually adjust their liquidity all the time, as the system will automatically adjust the allocation to optimize returns and reduce impermanent loss. This allows liquidity providers to earn real yield from trading fees without having to constantly monitor and adjust their liquidity.  Dynamic Fees  The Liquidity Book model used by Swapline adjusts the fee structure automatically based on the volatility of a token pair. This is done to compensate for potential Impermanent Loss, which occurs when the prices of the tokens in a pair change at different rates, resulting in a loss of value for liquidity providers. If volatility increases, trading fees increase as well to offset the potential losses from Impermanent Loss. On the other hand, for non-volatile tokens, trading fees are set very low, and the liquidity efficiency is designed to ensure high APRs for liquidity providers. This means that Swapline can provide a more attractive yield for LPs while also minimizing the risk of Impermanent Loss.  Fully Decentralized and Secure  Swapline is built on audited Solidity code. Swapline takes security very seriously and has implemented various measures to ensure the safety of the protocol and its users. One of the primary steps taken is a thorough testing of the smart contract code before launch. This includes an initial scan by an external security platform, which helps to identify any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses while developing the code. Additionally, a full audit will be conducted by Hashex and the audit report will be made publicly available on the Swapline Docs page. By taking these steps, Swapline aims to mitigate any risks associated with the protocol and provide a secure and trustworthy platform for its users.  Sustainable Economics  Swapline\u2019s dual token system is designed to create sustainable value for the community and its projects. Token A is used to incentivize liquidity provisioning in automated vaults to bootstrap liquidity, while Token B is a limited governance token allowing the community to become part of the DAO and its business model. The innovative thing about the SwapLine token economy, however, is not the pure double token system alone, but the way the two tokens influence each other through the upgrade function. The result is a DEX that is built up with different levels to steadily gain robustness and independence. With these features, SwapLine is designed to establish itself for the long term and generate sustainable value for the community.  Fairlaunch  A fair launch means that Swapline starts without any pre-mined tokens or pre-sale of tokens to select individuals or groups. This ensures that all participants start with equal opportunities and no one has an unfair advantage over others. This approach puts the community first, as it allows anyone to participate and benefit from the launch, regardless of their connections or resources. Additionally, a fair launch ensures transparency and trust in Swapline, as there are no hidden actors or secret deals behind the scenes. Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?: Our protocol aims to solve real DEX problems while focusing on sustainability. By automating liquidity and providing real yield opportunities, we make it easy for users to utilize DeFi opportunities. By taking into account the six aspects mentioned earlier, Swapline is creating a DEX that is unprecedented from both technical and economic perspectives. These unique selling points will provide Swapline with a competitive edge, enabling it to thrive in the wider DeFi arena. Looking at other chains, Liquidity Book Model introduced by Traderjoe, has shown great success on other chains like Arbitrum and AVAX. It is considered the most effective way to trade tokens compared to other DEXs. With just a small percentage of liquidity, users can facilitate a high volume of trading opportunities. In the area of concentrated liquidity, traders can execute trades with zero slippage. Compared to Uniswap, the Liquidity Book Model is more flexible and gas-efficient for managing liquidity because each price tick is organized in a separate bin represented by a specific ERC1155 token. This allows users to add, change, or withdraw liquidity in any form or strategy. In contrast, Uniswap organizes each full position in NFTs, reducing flexibility and making it more difficult to manage provided liquidity. Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: The Liquidity Book model used by Swapline provides ample opportunities for further development, such as the creation of vaults, aggregators, and analytical platforms. This makes Swapline an attractive option for other teams looking to build on top of the Liquidity Book model and potentially migrate to the Optimism network. Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: That\u2019s probably not the focus of a DEX. Is your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: The addition of new teams building on top of Liquidity Book would bring more growth and development to the ecosystem. This, in turn, would make the overall chain more attractive to existing developers, who would be more confident in continuing to build on it. Swapline\u2019s innovative approach is at the forefront of DeFi innovation, which further increases its appeal to developers and investors. Provide us with links to any of the following for the project: Website: www.swapline.com (not launched yet) Twitter: https://twitter.com/SwaplineDEX Discord/Discourse/Community: TBD Do you have any metrics on the project currently? We still haven\u2019t launched our protocol so we don\u2019t have any metrics available at this moment. Who are your competitors?: Swapline competes with a range of DEXs and AMMs operating on the Optimism network. However, when it comes to a more narrow competitor, we can consider Uniswap V3. Uniswap V3 also offers concentrated liquidity functionality, which is a key feature of our Liquidity Book. However, we believe that Liquidity Book overall, our dynamic fee system and automatic liquidity management vaults set us apart and provide a more flexible environment for liquidity providers to earn higher returns with their crypto. What differentiates you from your competitors?: At Swapline, we differentiate ourselves from our competitors in several ways:   Liquidity Book: Our Liquidity Book feature allows us to concentrate liquidity into single bins, which leads to more efficient and flexible liquidity provisioning and seamless trading experiences with zero slippage and low fees.   Dynamic fee system: Our dynamic fee system adjusts fees during volatile situations to reduce and compensate for possible impairment loss.   Automatic liquidity management: Our automatic liquidity management vaults help to have the liquidity at the right place without the need to adjust manually on the user side.   Automated Limit Orders: Our limit order feature gives traders the opportunity to buy and sell crypto without any fees or slippage. With the liquidity book protocol, it\u2019s even possible to earn real yield while trading.   Sustainable Token Economics: Focus on building a sustainable ecosystem and creating long-term value for our community. This is reflected in the DEX\u2019s dual token system with Token A and Token B, which incentivizes token pools sustainably and allows liquidity providers to become part of the DAO\u2019s business model and earn real yield.   Fairlaunch: Our self funded approach allow us to fully fairlaunch the DEX without any VC involvement, token presale, pre-airdrop. The community comes first and Swapline will be started without hidden actors   Will your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please explain: Interoperability and composability are critical aspects of the DeFi ecosystem. As a DEX, Swapline is designed to be composable with other protocols on the Optimism chain, such as lending, aggregator, or compounder protocols. This means that users can easily integrate Swapline into their DeFi workflows and take advantage of the liquidity and trading features that Swapline offers. Moreover, Swapline\u2019s Liquidity Book feature is designed to provide greater liquidity efficiency, which can benefit other protocols on the Optimism chain by improving their liquidity and reducing slippage for their users. This can lead to a more seamless and interconnected DeFi ecosystem, where users can easily move between different protocols and applications to achieve their financial goals. Team Who are your founders?: Swapline is a DeFi project that will be developed and established by a highly dedicated team of experts with more than 150 years of combined experience from diverse business sectors.

Is this your first Web3 project?: This is our first Web3 project, but the team has been working together for many years in the web2 and software space. If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): \u2013 I understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained further in this post 2: [Yes/No]: Yes Is your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has: Our project is self-funded with a runway of more than 1 year. Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 50k OP How do you justify the size of the grant? Our primary focus at Swapline is on our community and creating a product that meets the needs of our users while minimizing technical and economic risks. To achieve this goal, we have made the decision to self-fund our development process, without relying on VC funding or token presales. Our intention is to fully fairlaunch the DEX, without the risk of private investors overshadowing our community. To facilitate this process, we are seeking a grant to cover costs such as future audits, marketing, and future feature development. This will enable us to deliver the best possible product to our users while maintaining our commitment to transparency and community-driven development. Roadmap Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project: Already done:  Liquidity Book Trading Module Manual Liquidity Pools Automated Limit Orders Farming / staking pools Upgrader: Token A to Token B FairlaunchPad   1203\u00d71034 73.2 KB   image1489\u00d71143 72 KB  To be done for launch:  Automated Liquidity Vaults Full Audit Bribing System  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) We have not publicly shared our GitHub or smart contract addresses yet. But we are planning to do this after the audit. But we are happy to show the protocol in a live demo. Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: No. What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?: A portion of the OP tokens that we have received will be allocated to additional incentives, aimed at attracting more liquidity to the platform. The remaining tokens will be used to cover future protocol costs, ensuring the long-term sustainability of Swapline. By utilizing these tokens in a strategic and transparent manner, we can continue to build and improve our DEX for the benefit of our users and the wider DeFi community. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period. Our milestone will be centered around improving key metrics that directly impact our users, including active user growth, trading volume, available trading pairs, and total value locked. By prioritizing these metrics, we aim to enhance the overall user experience on our platform and drive growth on the Optimism chain. For example: Month 1 : 1-2 millions TVL Month 3 : 2-10 millions TVL Month 6 : 10-50 millions TVL The current market conditions are challenging and we all know this but our team at Swapline is focused on the long-term vision and mission. As a dynamic and agile team, we are well-positioned to adapt to changes in the DeFi space and take advantage of new opportunities as they arise. We think it\u2019s difficult to predict specific milestones in the current market but we are committed to building the best possible DEX for traders, liquidity providers, and DAO members on Optimism. Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards.  Launch of Homepage (Soon) Finished Audit Launch of Base Protocol (Liquidity Book AMM + Automated vaults) Launch of Incentive Layer with Fairlaunch Scaling up Liquidity pools and farms Launch of Upgrader  Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: One of our key objectives at Swapline is to increase liquidity efficiency on the Optimism chain. We believe that by offering users a seamless and user-friendly platform to trade assets, we can encourage more liquidity to flow into the ecosystem. To achieve this goal, we are constantly exploring new strategies and techniques to improve the efficiency and functionality of our platform. By increasing liquidity efficiency, we aim to create a more vibrant and sustainable DeFi ecosystem on the Optimism chain, benefiting both traders and liquidity providers. In addition we could pick Optimism as our homechain. This means that all users of Swapline, doesn\u2019t matter on which chain in the future, need to bridge their Token A to Optimism to upgrade them to Token B. This will provide a strong incentive for users on other chains to join the Optimism ecosystem, leading to increased adoption and growth for both Swapline and Optimism. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: On the technical side, we are dedicated to increasing liquidity efficiency on the Optimism chain, and our Liquidity Book model plays a critical role in this effort. By consolidating liquidity in single bins, we provide users with a smoother and more efficient trading experience, mostly with zero slippage and low fees. Our dynamic fee system adjusts fees during volatile situations to minimize possible impairment loss, while our automatic liquidity management vaults help us to ensure that liquidity is in the right place at the right time without the need for manual adjustments. Overall, these features work together to create a more robust and sustainable DeFi ecosystem on the Optimism chain, benefitting both traders and the broader community. On the token economic side, Swapline was designed to create sustainable value for the community, and their projects. The community is the focus and Swapline grows together with the ecosystem! This long-term vision is anchored in the DEX\u2019s dual token system with Token A and Token B. With Token A, token pools can be incentivized sustainably, while with Token B all liquidity providers in the community can become part of the DAO and its business model. Due to the innovative inhouse developed upgrader smart contract, Token A and Token B are in balance with each other, making them more robust to fluctuations in the crypto market. All technical and economical aspects of the DEX will be explained in more detail in our whitepaper. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: We could choose Optimism as our homechain, which means that Swapline would incentivize users to join the Optimism ecosystem to upgrade their Token A tokens to Token B tokens and earn higher yields. This can potentially attract more users to the Optimism chain and increase its overall usage and adoption. How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: Decentralized finance is increasingly evolving into a seemingly borderless multichain experience, removing some of the biggest barriers to growth in the sector. Optimism in combination with the future capabilities of its underlying superchain is spearheading the industry in this field. Swapline\u2019s vision is to offer a DEX that stays true to the values of decentralization while providing user-friendly access that can compete with traditional finance platforms. We believe with Optimism, Swapline would be ideally positioned to achieve this vision. Is your project Optimism Native?: For the beginning, yes. Swapline will be first launched on Optimism. But overall Swapline will expand with the liquidity pools to other chains. Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes. I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes. ",

Please find below the answers to your questions:  Comparison between Swapline and Velodrome  While Velodrom and Swapline are both decentralized exchanges, they are quite different on a technical as well as on a token economical perspective. On the technical side, Velodrome uses the Univ2 AMM model plus stable swaps (Solidly fork), which pools assets and provides liquidity on a 1:1 ratio on the full price range. Swapline, on the other hand, uses the Liquidity Book model (JoeV2 fork), which allows liquidity providers to concentrate their liquidity around specific price ranges also called \u201cbins\u201d to minimize slippage and maximize yield. This enables traders to execute large trades with no slippage within a specific bin. Additionally, Swapline adjusts fees dynamically based on the volatility of a token pair to offset potential impermanent loss for liquidity providers. As Liquidity Book is a completely new and innovative DEX method (actually a mix between Order Book and classical AMM) we would be happy to give more insights about it in a demo. Here is one example of the DEX frontend:  1203\u00d71034 73.2 KB  On the token economical side, Velodrome is using the ve(3,3) mechanics with vesting, voting, bribing to incentivise their liquidity and farm emissions. Swapline is using a quite different approach with two liquid tokens (Unlimited Reward Token & Hard Cap Governance Token) to incentivise the different DEX features and bootstrapping liquidity. The most innovative part about the two token system is the mechanic of how both influence each other. The two tokens are linked via a special smart contract we developed and audited. In addition, Swapline will have state of the art features like native limit orders, zapping, voting and bribing.  Plans for our team size  At present, our team comprises 10 members, who are capable of managing all aspects of the work required for our project. We have a well-rounded team that includes developers, designers, marketers, and other professionals who are working diligently to ensure the success of our protocol. As we continue to grow and expand, we understand that the demands on our team may increase. Therefore, we remain open to the idea of expanding our developer team in the future, if necessary. Our focus is on building a strong, sustainable foundation for our project, and if we find that additional help is required to achieve that goal, we will not hesitate to bring in new team members who share our vision.  Builders vs Growth  After we evaluated both Builders and Growth Experiments grants our decision went the Builders way, as we thought it would give us more flexibility on how we use the funds. We could either use it in order to incentivise the protocol or we could use it to further develop the protocol. We are huge fans of Optimism and the vision it is pursuing (with its underlying superchain infrastructure). First and foremost we want to become part of Optimism\u2019s growing ecosystem and take the path bringing the most value to the community. So we are curious to learn your thoughts on this and are open to adjusting our approach to your advice. Thanks, 0xJo ",
