My apologies.] following this thread ([Proposal] Petition Letter to A16z), which seems to have received a warm feedback from the community, I am moving on to the next step with this Signal Request. This Signal Request asks if you agree to sign (with on-chain vote)  Governance the petition letter uploaded to the IPFS here: ipfs://QmYDpsrhpnBNp4N8ASGCprw8iVEN8tLMGxzkzDNkgaNNWH which you should be able to view directly with Brave Browser in a decentralised way or https://bafybeies2vgpzxnrrc7i76wuefswn2tnnqboqzckpnognfklfhkit2x5ry.ipfs.dweb.link/  With any other browser (centralised proxy). The advantage of uploading on IPFS is that the document is immutable (as opposed to, e.g., a forum post here), because the address is its hash.    Do you want to sign the A16z petition linked above?  YES NO ABSTAIN     0 voters     REMARKS:  I have re-read the letter and improved it using comments from community members. Nevertheless it might still be imperfect and/or contain typos. In such a case please let me know and I will edit the document and modify the IPFS address accordingly. The important thing is to have an immutable petition letter once the on-chain poll starts.  Communication to A16z. Once the onchain poll is completed, everybody will be able to see the result. Therefore anybody is free to inform A16z and/or the community about the result in the way they prefer.  Next Steps: This poll will be open for about two weeks and will be closed the 7th of April. After this time, if the outcome is positive (YES > NO), the poll will move to on-chain. ",

I think it signals weakness rather than strength. We are not in a position to actually make demands, we are supposed to self-manage, and asking for their involvement is contradictory. The idea that Maker needs to call for help weakens the DAO thesis, or alternatively the idea that we think a16z owes Maker anything is a very bad look. Maybe the idea is to send an innocuous message \u201chey just a reminder that you can participate !\u201d but doing it in public through a \u2018petition\u2019 undermines that goal.\u201d ",

If this was a run of the mill startup, company leadership would be engaged with their largest investors and leveraging their expertise to build the company. We are building a completely new way of working and are in uncharted waters - large VCs like a16z have worked with thousands of startups and have the knowledge and expertise to help build something game-changing. Successful VCs got to where they were due to their advisory skills and resources they bring to the table, they are not in the business of solely cutting checks. If I own the hottest startup in the valley and I\u2019m raising capital, do I look purely at whoever will provide me the highest valuation? No, I\u2019m going to pick the investors who bring something to the table. Look at their website: \"We aim to connect entrepreneurs, investors, executives, engineers, academics, industry experts, and others in the technology ecosystem. We have built a network of experts including technical and executive talent; top media and marketing resources; Fortune 500/Global 2000 companies; as well as other technology decision makers, influencers, and key opinion leaders. a16z uses this network as part of our commitment to help our portfolio companies grow their business, so our operating teams provide entrepreneurs with access to expertise and insights across the entire spectrum of company building.\" This letter signals to me the humility of the community and lack of ego - no one in the community knows it all and reaching out to a seasoned firm to engage them proactively only seems logical to me.

It might be that:  they have helped a lot the Foundation during the last few years? maybe they haven\u2019t, but this is not their fault but of the legal difficulties around the foundation and MKR in general (as a security?).

The poll asks if you agree to formally run a on-chain Governance poll to approve (or not) the petition letter uploaded to the IPFS here: ipfs://QmYDpsrhpnBNp4N8ASGCprw8iVEN8tLMGxzkzDNkgaNNWH which you should be able to view directly with Brave Browser in a decentralised way or https://bafybeies2vgpzxnrrc7i76wuefswn2tnnqboqzckpnognfklfhkit2x5ry.ipfs.dweb.link/ With any other browser (centralised proxy). The advantage of uploading on IPFS is that the document is immutable (as opposed to, e.g., a forum post here), because the address is its hash.    Do you agree on running a Governance poll to approve the petition letter linked above?  YES NO ABSTAIN     0 voters     REMARKS:  You are only voting on the opportunity to run such a poll. Not on accepting or rejecting the letter. I have re-read the letter and improved it using comments from community members. Nevertheless it might still be imperfect and/or contain typos. In such a case please let me know and I will edit the document and modify the IPFS address accordingly. The important thing is to have an immutable petition letter once the on-chain poll starts.  Communication to A16z. Once the onchain poll is completed, everybody will be able to see the result. Therefore anybody is free to inform A16z and/or the community about the result in the way they prefer.  ",

                    "content": "Hello, It is amazing how MakerDAO is handling the move from a semi-centralised entity (under the supervision of The Foundation) to a fully decentralised DAO. Considering that this process is happening in a purely decentralised fashing, is nothing short of amazing. This said, it goes without saying, that there are tons of business-processes, good practices, experience, contacts, knowledge, that are hard to achieve (especially in the short term) this way. As it is well-known, MakerDAO is in the portfolio of A16Z (Portfolio - Andreessen Horowitz). They hold a good amount of MKR. It is also known, in the community, that A16Z has been silent in the last few years. They have never directly interacted with the community. [Note: Maybe they did interact with the Foundation. We don\u2019t know] It is quite possible that MakerDAO is, for them, just one of many investments, and they didn\u2019t find it valuable to invest resources in it, yet. However they might change their mind, or consider it in a different way, if we asked them explicitly to show up and give advice (as a very resourcefull MKR-holding entity). PROPOSAL:  Let\u2019s prepare, by a distributed effort, a letter for them to request their help/collaboration/support in this important phase of MakerDAO. Let MKR holders sign this letter through vote (this gives it Governance authority). Let\u2019s send this letter to A16Z. This letter should be public (in the spirit of the DAO) anyway.  I believe such an initiative would be appreciated by A16Z. If also released to the \u2018press\u2019 in the appropriate way, it could even be good publicity for both MakerDAO and A16Z. What do you think? NOTE 1: A16Z clearly states here (link) that:  Put simply, our primary objective in governance is to create the conditions necessary for protocols to achieve long-term adoption and self-sustainability.  I think this sounds very promising, considering that this is exactly the type of help we\u2019d like to get from them. NOTE 2: I made this proposal with A16Z in mind. But the same could be pushed forward with outer institutional investors involved in MakerDAO. ",

See bottom-right of page 7 of this document.: A16Z, Ether Capital corp, 1 confirmation, Polychain, Pantera, Paradigm and Dragonfly. However:  I think this list is actually outdated, e.g., I think Polychain has sold most of their MKR.   I think it makes sense to contact A16z first. They have the 3rd largest wallet of MKR (see this) and they are generally recognised as a top-notch crypto VC.  Beside starting to draft a document, @LongForWisdom added that we\u2019d benefit from having the following 2 further points: 7) a contact (email, telephone, whatever) in case of Emergency. 8) a contact (email, telephone, whatever) to be in contact with them for ordinary stuff that it might be of their interest. Please, let me know if you see some other important points to add to the list. Then (if nobody else does it first) I will try to draft something as soon as I have some time available. ",

It would be great if the community could build on it and reach some consensus eventually (sooner is better than later). Remark: I really want to see Petition Letter coming to reality. I don\u2019t really mind if my proposal below is 100% discarded. It\u2019s just a first attempt. All I want is progress   [\u2026 Letter to a16z \u2026] to the attention of the Andreessen Horowitz A16z  Crypto team. Following its investment thesis and its long term vision on DeFi,  A16z crypto has invested in MakerDAO in September 2018. The involvement of A16z crypto brought a new level of excitement and credence to the MakerDAO community and has helped its development over the course of the last few years. Currently A16z owns the wallet with the third largest amount of MKR tokens and therefore owns more than 6% of the voting power in the MakerDAO governance system. Since September 2018 MakerDAO has managed to achieve outstanding technical results, including the successful launch of multi-collateral DAI in 2019, and today is undoubtably one of the leading protocols in the DeFi space. This amazing growth has been enabled by an engaged decentralised community coordinated and supported by the Maker Foundation, a private organisation lead by Rune Christensen, one of the founders of MakerDAO. As planned from the very beginning, however, the Maker Foundation is going to be dissolved soon. This event corresponds to a critical, historical and exciting moment for MakerDAO: the decentralised community will have to manage itself and its DeFi protocol successfully without relying on a single centralised organisation. Since the beginning of 2021, the MakerDAO decentralised community has made significant steps towards decentralisation. Several Core Units, independent and focused groups of contributors paid by MakerDAO with the profits of the protocol, are being proposed, discussed and approved via the Governance process. But the path towards full decentralisation is hard, full of intricacies and is resource consuming. The help of all members of our decentralised community is now more needed than ever. One of the key objectives of A16z crypto is:  Put simply, our primary objective in governance is to create the conditions necessary for protocols to achieve long-term adoption and self-sustainability.  For the above reasons, the MakerDAO decentralised community wishes to ask the full participation and support of A16z in this important moment. We\u2019d be thrilled to be able to interact in a fully transparent way (forums, chats, onchain governance, etc), in the true spirit of DeFi, with the incredibly talented A16z  Crypto team. Specifically, we encourage A16z to:  Participate in onchain governance and voting, using the 60k MKR tokens in  their wallet. Through some chosen representative, participate actively in chat and forum discussions. Bring ideas and expertise to the community: legal, recruiting processes, marketing, communication, business opportunities, etc. Interact and challenge the existing and forthcoming Core Units to make sure they meet the highest standards of quality.  We, the MakerDAO decentralised community, are proud to have you onboard and can\u2019t wait to interact with you to keep developing our protocol and innovating in the DeFi space. With best regards, MakerDAO community  Some edits to implement suggestions came as PMs (thanks!)  \u2192 The involvement of A16z crypto brought a new level of excitement and credence to the MakerDAO community and has helped its development over the course of the last few years.
