                    "content": "Over the last two rounds of Gitcoin Grants, we\u2019ve brought in a number of grantees and contributors in the community to help us think about how to better fund digital public goods and serve the web3 community, whether by stopping sybil attacks, improving grants discoverability, or more precisely defining the kinds of public goods that can be funded. Through those conversations, we\u2019ve learned a lot about what we\u2019re doing well, and what we could improve on. One comment that came up frequently was that although we regularly seek feedback from community members and strive to be credibly neutral, we\u2019ve historically had the final say in how Gitcoin Grants operates and have a decent amount of centralization debt. Now, we want to pay down that debt, and empower the community to govern and to act. What are stewards?  With that in mind, I\u2019m excited to propose the creation of a new stewards program as the first (hopefully of many) meta-governance proposals. While we want the community to have the final say in even what stewardship means, here are a few key areas we\u2019ve identified that we need support from the previous roundtables we\u2019ve held:  Setting grants round categories and sizes (how much funding should go to a matching pool for core infrastructure as compared to community or media?) Determining what kinds of public goods we care about (e.g. is an open source project with VC funding still a public good?) Defining what kind of behavior counts as a sybil-attack or collusion (when is collusion just squads vibing) Finding credibly neutral ways to display grantees so that everyone has an equal shot at being funded  How do you know if this is right for you? If the problems above sound interesting, and you care deeply about finding better solutions to fund our digital infrastructure, you\u2019re in! That said, being a steward will definitely take some time, and you should probably be prepared to block off at least an hour out of your week (4-6 hours a month) to sync with other stewards and check out what\u2019s new as this forum grows. Here are a few of the other duties / workstreams we think stewards might want to consider based on some of the problems we face (synthesizing the areas we identified above): Meta-Governance: How we define organizational processes for Gitcoin with the community Public Goods Funding: Helping rally the community to fund public goods, setting criteria for matching rounds, and finding ways to get Gitcoin involved in funding new digital public goods we might have missed Anti-Fraud and Collusion Detection: Analyzing Gitcoin data and brainstorming long-term identity and mechanism design solutions for Sybil-Resistance Progressive Decentralization: Finding ways to modularize and simplify Gitcoin\u2019s architecture for the community to use in perpetuity Special Projects: Finding ways to use Gitcoin\u2019s new architecture to build interesting / novel solutions around public goods funding These are just ideas, this post is a first step and we have many more to take. If you have any other ideas for these kinds of workstreams feel free to suggest them as a thread in the governance-meta category! Introducing Yourself  Just so we can gauge interest, please write a short post below and make sure to include the following:  Gitcoin Username ETH Address Discord Handle (optional) Statement of Intention / Your Values & Reasons for Joining Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills  Next Steps Once we\u2019ve reviewed your application, we\u2019ll add you to our Stewards Health cards so people can start delegating to you, but that\u2019s just the start! Read up here on the next steps in the onboarding process and join our Discord. My own nomination for reference:  Gitcoin username: ceresstation ETH Address: ceresstation.eth Statement of Intention / My Values & Reason for Joining: I believe that the true potential of web3 is to completely change how we coordinate value, in particular around our digital infrastructure. In the metaverse as many are now calling it, our identities are a core piece of that infrastructure, and so we have to ensure we maintain their integrity collectively, and continue to evolve them in an interoperable way. This doesn\u2019t only mean funding goods within the ENS ecosystem. There are so many builders in the Ethereum ecosystem that have brought us to where we are today, and that will help us find a path to where we need to be tomorrow. Our task as a working group should be to identify those builders, and the mechanisms that we can use to sustainably fund them. By helping to steward this workstream, I commit to helping us do that in a transparent, accountable way, alongside any and all ecosystem partners who want to help us on this journey. Together, we can create a positive-sum world . What Web3 Qualifications / Skills I have:  Actively participated in the Ethereum ecosystem since 2016 (and surprisingly, started a DAO project back then as well) Co-founded Gitcoin which has funded nearly $50m in Ethereum public goods to date Helped push forward one of the first Digital Public Goods Alliance communities of practice Served as a volunteer committee member in a variety of community grants programs including Ethereum Foundation Grants Helped provide guidance to a number of public goods projects throughout web3 including ENS / Optimism   Excited to start collaborating more with you all, onwards to decentralization.

I believe that Gitcoin will play an essential role in empowering online and open source communities in the near and long term future and I want to help guide and support the best outcomes for the community by being a Delegate/Steward. What Web3 Qualifications / Skills I Have: My experience working in Ethereum over the past 3 years has earned me a lot of trust within the various communities that I have helped create, from executing events that expand the reach of Ethereum to organizing working groups that solve difficult issues inside DAO\u2019s and Crypto companies I\u2019ve been around the block and will continue to show up where-ever people feel that they are stuck. Some of the various groups I\u2019ve worked with and co-created are Giveth, DappNode, MetaGame, MetaCartel, RaidGuild, DAOhaus, WhalerDAO, Panvala, MetaSpace, STAKEhaus (xDai), nfDAO, Matic, Fork The World, Hack For Freedom, Intercon, and I\u2019m sure many other little things I\u2019m forgetting. Most of my Involvement in the various governance initiatives be found in Discord, but I\u2019ve link the Discourse forums of a few below for transparency:  For MetaCartel, you can find my posts in the Forum and on-chain here.   For RaidGuild, things happen mostly in Discord internal chats and on-chain here.    For all DAO related activities on chain you can find my activities here.  Personally I\u2019m really excited to play a role in Progressive Decentralization and Meta Governance as my experience tracks well with organizing groups of people and helping them drive towards defined outcomes. Gitcoin has been at the heart of so many great initiatives, not mention on stage at my very first crypto conference in Prague 2018. It\u2019s been a constant source of inspiration and innovation in public goods, fund raising, and economic empowerment for many around the world. I believe with the right people helping to guide and steward the process it has the potential to 10 even 100x the impact it\u2019s already made, so here\u2019s to many more amazing experiments on Ethereum and beyond !

Giving the Community Members, and Gitcoin OGs to help out narrowing path of the Gitcoin is where my excitement aligns with the goals of Gitcoin being a Town Square for Ethereum Devs. I been around the Ethereum Community and close to Ethereum Devs since early 2019 and I\u2019m fan of Gitcoin since I found about it which was very early on my crypto path. I believe that as a Community we can drive Gitcoin\u2019s mission about Open Source development further, find more opportunities for new-coming developers to learn by filling out Quests, find their first gig by participating on Bounties, later on by fund-raising via Gitcoin Grants. What Web3 Qualifications / Skills I have: My experience with various crypto communities has earned me trust in the community. I have been working mainly around events, operations, community building, social media management, copywriting with various Ethereum projects. Educating Ethereum Meetup organisers, being the the magic wand holder in Ethereum Magicians supporting the community, and lately working on herding the cats around NFT Standard research. Some of the projects that I helped shine: Ethereum Magicians, Superfluid, Bitfwd, Sigma Prime (ETH2.0 Lighthouse client), dHEDGE, and a couple of smaller contributions here and there in other projects. Most of my involvement in various projects is in giving insights to projects, helping simplify the operations and processes, taking notes from calls and helping where ever I see the opportunity to contribute. Personally I would love to be involved with Gitcoin as I helped give some of the Governance questions regarding governance, stepping up and contributing to Open Source Development has been my passion since I have entered the crypto rabbit hole. Gitcoin has been deeper in my heart since they launched Kudos and I managed to snag the most of the kudos NFT that were in Friday\u2019s giveaway. Thanks to Gitcoin Ethereum Magicians are able to run their activities and supporting the community. I believe, with the mind oriented towards community, decentralisation, collaboration we can guided Gitcoin\u2019s road to become fully community owned protocol and improve the processes on the go. I love the impact that Gitcoin has on the Open Source Community and Ethereum Ecosystem, looking forward to get spot in the Stewards Council. Thank you Gitcoin Team for making Open Source more accessible  ",

What drew me in then is what draws me in today.  Gitcoin builds more than \u201cjust the tech\u201d, it also creates a community of builders who jointly believe in building a better future.  Further, by looking at projects fundraising on Gitcoin I was able to build a learning roadmap of all the best concepts and projects in the eth ecosystem.  The steward\u2019s program allows me to participate in a community I very much believe in. On top of that - I want to join the stewards program to work on and contribute to the Governance space of Open Source communities (specifically that of delegated authority, republics/representative democracies, and liberal democracies.)  So far, we\u2019ve only experimented with a few limited governance models (direct democracies, benevolent dictators, etc).  It\u2019s time to understand how we can leverage more modern concepts and models for crypto governance.  When these newer concepts are combined with crypto, we can test what \u201copen source governance\u201d looks like. What Web3 Qualifications / Skills I Have :  I\u2019ve been actively working in the Ethereum space for about three years and have been on a journey of learning.  Currently, I\u2019m the founder of Govrn (a decentralized and Open Source Politics startup) and a RadicalxChange Fellow.  A few communities I contribute to are Metacartel, Raid Guild, WhalerDAO, DAO Book Club, DAO Rush Week, and Panvala.

Public goods funding, among other things, attracted me to crypto. When I left a traditional job to work full-time in crypto, grants from MetaCartel and, later, Gitcoin helped me get started. Gitcoin helps people serve multiple protocols and communities - something people should have the ability to do. I know developers in India who now have financial freedom from completing Gitcoin bounties. I have participated in Gitcoin Kernel and gotten a lot of value from the community. I\u2019ve thought a lot about on-chain reputation and think Gitcoin can help people break out of the shackles of their social graph and financial situation. I hope to help Gitcoin achieve these goals as a delegate/steward. What qualifications do you have: I founded Llama, which helps DAOs manage their treasury. I have helped DAOs with spending, asset allocation, and reporting. Governance and treasuries go hand in hand: what can\u2019t be automated can be voted on by governance and funded by the treasury. I am leading Aave Grants DAO, which aims to empower a wider network of developers to grow the Aave ecosystem. I am working on a treasury diversification strategy with Uniswap. I lead an ecosystem development project for Ethereum Foundation in India. Where can your involvement in other governance initiatives be found:   Aave: leading Aave Grants DAO  Uniswap: building treasury strategy  Index: discussions on treasury management  Nexus Mutual: investment committee discussions  Gitcoin: discussions on handing Vitalik\u2019s $500m donation  ",

Over the past few years, I\u2019ve observed and appreciated many experiments attempting to get open source projects funded as well as directly working on processes to encourage open source contributors to get involved in various projects. Open-source created this beautifully optimistic model for public collaboration, however, over the past two decades or so, there has been a shift towards individual maintainers being depended on despite having millions of people use their code. It has become obvious that the platforms, roles, structures, and incentives need a revitalization. I believe Gitcoin will and is already having a massive impact in the revitalization of the open-source software industry and I want to continue to contribute to that mission. In general, as a Delegate/Steward, I\u2019m interested in helping support the Meta-Governance and Progressive Decentralization initiatives. More specifically, I want to help architect the governance system from both the technical and process perspective (includes strategy around iterative decentralization), think deeply with others around incentive models, and overall contribute to the future of the digital public goods infrastructure. Qualifications: I\u2019ve been a contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem for a while now, previously helping with improving the project management processes of AllCoreDevs with the Ethereum Cat Herders, supporting the EIP governance process, technical audit coordination of EIPs, network upgrade coordination, advising Ethereum.org, and working on developer growth strategies. Previously, I was the Decentralized Governance Architect at the Maker Foundation building out decentralized governance processes and kicking off the self-sustaining DAO initiative. I remain involved with MakerDAO on the governance core unit, as MIP Editor. Currently, my role is the COO of Element Finance, where I focus on operations, governance architecture, token economics, and mechanism design. I\u2019m very focused on building projects that help bridge the TradFi industry with DeFi, allowing anyone to have open access to financial products with ease. Outside of daily work, over the next few months, I\u2019m looking forward to mentoring the KERNEL Block 3 fellows! Fun fact: I\u2019ve been passionate about Gitcoin for a long time and was one of the first Gitcoin ambassadors back in 2018! Additionally, I helped document all the features of Gitcoin ~2 years ago and held the first Gitcoin developer\u2019s meetup in Toronto  ",

I believe in the power of community building and I can see that developers empower each other with web3 knowledge. I participated in Hackathons(EthBerlin, EthWaterloo, Eth Denver) and online (DragonQuest/ ConsensysHealth - STOP COVID19) and got hooked into web3 development.

I am a bloke but I onboard more Jills (except my wife)  Buidl and hodl (also I spendl), envision it will change the world since like 12 years ago and 6 years ago.

Below is his profile in English that I created with his consent (I am his diplomat and Twitter/Discord operator): a KOL that always be open and transparent, influence reaches 50,000+ actual crypto users including ~1000 paid subscribers How both of us differ from other opinion leaders, is that always consider how the influence would impact people who may take my action/thoughts as investment advice (for example, DaYou created the \u2018Hodlers of XVS club\u2019 while the token was ~$2 as can see the strategic position it is on Binance Smart Chain (sidechain of ETH),  900 holders joined because of Dayou\u2019s detailed analysis, and most of them hold it until it reached $100.)

But, I also understand the complexity in managing the oversight of any system that attempts to represent and hold up the voices of a diverse community. I\u2019ve long been passionate about Gitcoin and the challenges around funding public goods in the space and have been an active participant around conversations in how we deal with challenges such as manipulation of quadratic function. During this discussions I grew concerned that often these solutions are over-engineered and we reduce the actions of people down to numbers in a machine and forget to take into account the different behavioral patterns that others may have in different socio-economic and cultural lots of life. My hope in partaking in Gitcoin governance is to be an active voice in representing under represented individuals and preventing our public goods infrastructure from becoming a cultural monolith, or popularity contest.

I want to help the project scale to become a powerhouse for Web3 development. This past year normalized working from home. I believe there is going to be increasing demand for bounty work and Gitcoin is perfectly poised to onboard and match all the incoming talent with the rapidly increasing number of Web3 projects in need of microservices. Likewise, Gitcoin\u2019s innovative Grants curation, voting, and matching models have enabled dozens of new projects to get off the ground. These projects then pay it forward to the next round of projects. Gitcoin is turning the Web3 ecosystem into a self-funding organism capable of growing the parts it needs and funding them. It\u2019s a very exciting future, but not without it\u2019s challenges. I hope to help Gitcoin in navigate these challenges. What Web3 Qualifications / Skills I have: I\u2019ve been running the Blockchain Education Network for 3 years and have overseen the deployment of our own various Web3 initiatives (BENcoin, BEN NFTs, decentralized certificates, DAOs, meta-delegates) to aid in our mission to incentivize and gamify education. I\u2019m familiar with the requirements and challenges with running these types of projects. Since BEN has had our own Grant, I\u2019m very familiar with the Gitcoin experience from the grantee side and the donor side. I can leverage my experience into providing useful insight and guidance for the further development of Gitcoin. As the Americas Ecosystem Lead at Ontology Network, I\u2019ve done extensive work with various partners to integrate and advocate for decentralized identity solutions, which is a direction Gitcoin is going towards. I hope to increase my contribution in building the Gitcoin ecosystem. ",

Of course all the projects being built have immense utility to the wider community, but simply put many of our projects would not be possible without Gitcoin and the support that has made our development possible. Without Gitcoin / Kernel\u2019s contributions, the chance that my project, Swivel, would be where it is today would be low. And further there are dozens of projects in a similar situation having been incubated or perpetually funded by donations through Gitcoin. It is absolutely insane and serves as a testament to all that is possible with properly allocated funding and community effort. What Web3 Qualifications / Skills I have: I am currently the sole maintainer for a number of open-source web3 and web2 projects, am a Gitcoin Kernel mentor, ETHGlobal hackathon judge, etc\u2026 however beyond all this, I am currently the Founder & CEO of Swivel Finance, a project that came out of Gitcoin Kernel\u2019s Genesis cohort. At the start of the cohort I was just a hackathon addict, psychology graduate, and professional MOBA player (HOTS/LOL) with little hope of my day to day life being what it is today. So while I have plenty of technical and financial expertise surrounding financial derivatives and cash-flow markets within defi, I really feel that my largest value add is what I can provide based on my lived experience transitioning from a degenerate gamer. (Off the back of the community support that Gitcoin provided) I\u2019d love to provide Gitcoin with all the assistance my expertise and experience can give! ",

I am not a developer myself, I consider myself more of a Project Manager. The best experience I have is leading a community that uses web3  and understanding what problems new users are experiencing. I am planning to begin to learn programming concepts, not to be able to code myself but to be able to better communicate with my development team. Although I do not consider myself a programmer I would say I have a good understanding of the web3 workflow.

Since then, I\u2019ve built a very successful sales career while doing freelance writing and consulting on the side. I am committed to leaving a position where I have sold millions of USD in product and earned over $150,000 per year on average. My passion is now here. I don\u2019t want to do anything but this the rest of my life. Although my web3 qualifications and programming experience is lacking, I am working hard to master these skills. Until then, I can apply my extensive project management, marketing, sales and writing skills to help. I have no doubt that I can be a solid asset!

My experience has also lead me to believe that those who get the earliest access to those tools are those that benefit the most. For too long, corporate entities have owned and controlled the assets, and thereby come to own tools which could provide widespread value to society as a whole. What my experience has taught me is that these entities seek competitive advantage at the expense of progress in public goods. These power structures are the basis for why I think Web3 is so important. Creating tools which allow advancement, ascendence even, of the smallest person is imperative to be sure we aren\u2019t just creating more competitive advantage for the power structures that be. My Web3 Qualifications/Skills: I do not possess technical skills. Many affiliated with GitCoin may see this as a negative, but I believe this allows me to view proposals in a different light. Much of my background being in finance, sales, and client service gives me a leg up at reading through the tea leaves. While all the fancy language is nice, being able to cut through and explain the core data in a common man\u2019s language is what I believe sets me apart. It\u2019s not about ego or wanting to look smart, it\u2019s about clarity. Being a middle child, I have been forced to master a sense of compromise. Weighing sides, and coming to consensus is a truly enjoyable feat for me. I look forward to becoming a steward at GitCoin, and continuing to participate in the discussions, proposals, and overall progress of Web3. ",

(One of my core values is altruism) Currently open source software is undervalued (also under paid), I totally agree with Gitcoin to support public goods (like open source software). I believe Gitcoin will be a key role in the open source communities in future. And I would like to join this Steward/Delegate role to help the open source community as well. What Web3 Qualifications / Skills I Have: I started my crypto experience since 2018 by founding HiBlcok community, which had some results like translation solidity language, organizing blockchain meetups (100+) and hackathons in China. I am a developer and keep good relationships with different developer communities (some are blockchain related and some not). I follow Gitcoin since 2018 from the bounty, and have a deep test with first production, and also the later features like kudos, grant, and hackathon etc. I am inspired by Gitcoin values and products to support OSS community.  Birds of a feather flock together  In ethereum community I get the same results. I have many good friends in Ethereum community who are from AlphaWallet, imToken, bitfwd, Ethereum Foundation and Gitcoin. I find that it could get twice result with half effort if working with right people. I am sure I could be a right people to be Steward for Gitcoin (I was previous Gitcoin ambassadors).

I started with work in the humanitarian sector with Doctors Without Borders, doing field work in Indonesian , South Asian, running a fundraising team, and sitting on the board of directors. Since getting into blockchain, I have been focused less on supporting existing organizations, and more on supporting models that break the structures those organizations are built on. That is why I am passionate about Gitcoin.   Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills  I have been in the blockchain space since 2012, working at startups including Decentral, Ledger Labs, and ixo Foundation. My recent focus has been on education - I am Faculty with Singularity University, teaching entrepreneurs how to use exponential technologies like blockchains to solve problems that impact 1 billion people. This summer, I will be teaching a course on Blockchain-based Business Models for Social Impact at the Questrom School of Business. This year I published \u201cBitcoin and the Future of Fundraising\u201d, a book to guide charities through setting up crypto donation programs. I have mentored and judged at EthDenver, am part of MGD DAO and have spoken at crypto events around the world.    ",

When I stumbled across Gitcoin a while back, my values immediately aligned and immediately became active both as a grant supporter and grant recipient, amongst other things. That was way back in GR3, if memory serves. Ultimately, I became a KB2 alum. I am an adamant Blockchain4Good supporter and an active member in the Public Goods ecosystem. At the same time, I\u2019m interested in work sovereignty, governance, and regenerative economies, for starters. All aligned with Gitcoin\u2019s values, and accessible through the Gitcoin platform. I believe in Gitcoin. Period. It would be an honor & super cool to be part of the fabric building the open and funding the open web.  Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills  I\u2019ve been in the digital asset fundraising space since 2018, launching perhaps the first and maybe even only Crypto PTA (that I can find, and would love to find more, plz!). For those unawares, a PTA is a Parent-Teacher Association and quite common here in the U.S. What started as Happy Kids Dirty Hands eventually evolved to AmwFund, a 501c3 registered non-profit.

People will join the decentralized movement because they will be drawn in by - let\u2019s face it - the money, the bling bling. And this is okay. But this is just the first step, next is to inform them on why they should stick around and pull back the curtain. To truly empower people we need to fund the infrastructure that will support communities in the long run, and go beyond the short-term scarcity mindset. Open source is at the very core of blockchain technology and I think not enough people yet realize what the potential impact can be on the mindset of our entire civilization. In our current economic model open source will never be funded, because it is impossible to build a direct profit / value-extraction model around it. For this reason it is the very first thing that needs to be \u2018secured\u2019: without open source a decentralized model simply will not work, it will just be incorporated by the powers that be. It will become an empty shell. Creating sustainable open source models is the essential foundation we need, the next will be to fund and support any public good, any project that is essential for our and our planet\u2019s survival. Our current economic models do not only undervalue, but ignore public goods on purpose. Let\u2019s change this. Let\u2019s build our future.   My Web3 Qualifications / Skills Background: After 15 yrs in advertising and (digital) marketing, a.o. for agencies, Microsoft & start-ups, I joined the Ethereum ecosystem in 2017, first working for Swarm City on communications, then joining Giveth where I became the Communications lead, helped out with Aragon tasks and then started combining this with the same job and more at the Commons Stack, which I co-founded. Currently exploring lots of Ethereum projects, a.o. as a Gitcoin Kernel fellow and now mentor. Also started a project called Ethereum Explorer to bring in new talent. Skills: communication execution, strategy & project management. Always organizing and managing comms & more, I\u2019m not a specialist, more an all-rounder with a lot of focus on processes & efficiency. More on me here.   ",

Giving the Community Members, and Gitcoin OGs to help out narrowing path of the Gitcoin is where my excitement aligns with the goals of Gitcoin being a Town Square for Ethereum Devs. I been around the Ethereum Community and close to Ethereum Devs since early 2019 and I\u2019m fan of Gitcoin since I found about it which was very early on my crypto path. I believe that as a Community we can drive Gitcoin\u2019s mission about Open Source development further, find more opportunities for new-coming developers to learn by filling out Quests, find their first gig by participating on Bounties, later on by fund-raising via Gitcoin Grants. What Web3 Qualifications / Skills I have: My experience with various crypto communities has earned me trust in the community. I have been working mainly around events, operations, community building, social media management, copywriting with various Ethereum projects. Educating Ethereum Meetup organisers, being the the magic wand holder in Ethereum Magicians supporting the community, and lately working on herding the cats around NFT Standard research. Some of the projects that I helped shine: Ethereum Magicians, Superfluid, Bitfwd, Sigma Prime (ETH2.0 Lighthouse client), dHEDGE, and a couple of smaller contributions here and there in other projects. Most of my involvement in various projects is in giving insights to projects, helping simplify the operations and processes, taking notes from calls and helping where ever I see the opportunity to contribute. Personally I would love to be involved with Gitcoin as I helped give some of the Governance questions regarding governance, stepping up and contributing to Open Source Development has been my passion since I have entered the crypto rabbit hole. Gitcoin has been deeper in my heart since they launched Kudos and I managed to snag the most of the kudos NFT that were in Friday\u2019s giveaway. Thanks to Gitcoin Ethereum Magicians are able to run their activities and supporting the community. I believe, with the mind oriented towards community, decentralisation, collaboration we can guided Gitcoin\u2019s road to become fully community owned protocol and improve the processes on the go. I love the impact that Gitcoin has on the Open Source Community and Ethereum Ecosystem, looking forward to get spot in the Stewards Council. Thank you Gitcoin Team for making Open Source more accessible  ",

Well, the criteria for the measurement of efficiency is debatable, isn\u2019t it?

Physical infrastructure enables the movement of good and services while digital infrastructure enable the flow and legitimacy of information. While this is advantageous for the first world it\u2019s a game changer for the developing world. Blockchain technology offers trustless transactions, access to funding, proof of ownership and smart contract flexibility that could catapult villages in Mozambique and Malawi into modern productivity. I founded a web development school to provide access to freecodecamp.org and funding to South African adults in Diepsloot South Africa.

By night I am working through the Ethereum Docs, Eth.build, Kernel, the solidity docs and EatTheBlocks.

The goal in mind is to expose our student-members to the vast landscape that is DeFi Governance, while allowing them to proudly represent their collegiate chapter both domestically and abroad - enabling their capacity to participate in multi-protocol governance processes. For those who are unaware, founded in 2014, BEN is the longest running and largest 501(c)3 global network of blockchain students, professors, and alumni. We have over 80 blockchain clubs and university chapters in our network, and we provide students with educational resources, opportunities, internships, job matching, financial support for conference travel and more. With this in mind, there is a evident synergy between BEN\u2019s and Gitcoin governance structure - to amplify, elevate, and augment the voices of community participants while keeping the vision for the betterment of the underlying protocol/organization in mind. Through our Meta-Steward initiative we can continue in our pursuit to offer our student-members the tools, experience, and opportunities needed to thrive in any & all niche industries that emerge within DeFi. Similar to our Uniswap, Aave, Compound, and Decentraland Meta-Delegate committees, our Meta-Steward will hold monthly/bi-monthly governance meetings to deliberate and further review any & all developments and proposals (active & inactive) pertaining to Gitcoin\u2019s ecosystem.

I believe that distributed ledger technology has the ability to create a more inclusive economic system with institutional transparency and improved efficiency with regards to resource management. I support GItcoin\u2019s efforts to build web3 applications through the use of quadradic funding in an open source environment. Discussions around what constitutes the public good and how to address the tragedy of the commons in web3 are incredibly productive and essential. Crypto is currently in an interesting place and the next few years will determine the long term direction of what we will refer to as web3. I want to work to support the civic use of DLT so that we all might collectively benefit from its ability to transfer value in a trustless environment. Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills: I have participated in a number of different communities since 2017 as a community member. I have seen more projects fail than succeed.

I guess that the transition to Gitcoin DAO is just a natural step for every creative engineer  A must watch video: The Third Industrial Revolution: A Radical New Sharing Economy - YouTube My short and inspirational web3 story: Joined 1Hive in 2020, contributed a lot as a creative/builder and from marketing, support and onboarding standpoint. I had the public goods \u201cclique\u201d because of 1Hive. My efforts in 1Hive and the TEC were noticed by one of the Gitcoin Stewards and he later invited me to join Gitcoin\u2019s FDD Grant Review Squad in August 2021.  I knew about, donated and contributed to Gitcoin since 2020, even created a grant for my local artist community, but I\u2019ve never thought that I could have the chance to actually contribute to Gitcoin DAO itself and in the web3 frenzy between(2020-2022) it never crossed my mind. Now, after a year in Gitcoin DAO I can honestly say I am very happy to be part of this amazing environment in which all the people involved have such an amazing growth oriented, inclusive mindset and regen mindset.

The third industrial revolution is here and we need to ensure that everybody at least has equal access to the next evolution of the web(equal opportunity is still far away) all while trying to preserve it\u2019s security and values! My work in the the FDD and Gitcoin DAO in the past year: Present lead of GIA, FDD. In GR12, GR13 I was the Grant Eligibility lead and in GR14 I became the GIA initiative lead.

I was the first person to leave the core team to work exclusively on the DAO and be paid only by the DAO. After 2 full seasons leading the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream, we now have the FDD-OS v1.0 which has a purpose of removing the workstream lead role from existing. During season 13 I will still maintain a veto right over our new source council. My intention is to let go completely before Season 15. During the next couple of seasons, I will be participating and paid like any other FDD Source Council member. As we move towards my removal, I will use veto power and authority sparingly. I intend to equip the workstream with a clear essential intent aligning them with the rest of Gitcoin. I intend to leave them with good processes and cadence for synchronizing behind their process and knowing when to change the process itself. When I am no longer the FDD workstream lead, I intend to remain a source council member for at least a couple more seasons. I intend to lead a few squads which can grow into their own workstreams.

Part of the reason I was able to start contributing to Llama is thanks to funding from Gitcoin. In the past, I was active in the independent maker space; one of the problems that people faced was a lack of financial support to help them realize their ideas. Gitcoin can help change this dynamic and give people the opportunity to build innovative new public goods. I\u2019d like to become a Gitcoin Steward so I can help advance Gitcoin\u2019s mission through productive use of the treasury. Prior to becoming involved in crypto, I worked at a university endowment and helped manage large pools of capital. With proper management, Gitcoin\u2019s treasury is a valuable asset that can be used to grow the public goods ecosystem. Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills I\u2019ve been contributing to Llama since May 2021 and have been Community Lead there since December 2021.

I am getting concerned by the proliferation of greed in the digital asset space. When I first started participating in cryptocurrency I was immediately impressed by the potential to move the world in the direction of better justice, equality and wealth distribution. Instead I am seeing hints of the opposite. Wealth getting concentrated in the same areas, economic instability is occurring in many countries, and crypto is getting banned in some countries while being embraced in others. I think such things are happening because the digital asset space is being adopted as a runaway casino in which people want to get rich fast then exit the space. I believe the way to prevent this is by fundamentally changing the principals that digital assets are built on and distributed by. I am also a Trusted Seed at the Common Stack and a member of 1hive Dao.  I was part of a universal basic income project utilizing algorithmic stablecoins until it sadly ceased operations. Becoming a Gitcoin Steward will empower me to help change the course of crypto for the better. ",

I am eager to be of service to the DAO and will communicate regularly with community members about all significant decisions being made. I am dedicated to public goods, decentralized decision making, the wisdom of the crowd.

Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills: I am the Cause Round lead for Gitcoin DAO helping to facilitate grants rounds for Climate Solutions, Diversity Equity and Inclusion as well as Crypto Advocacy. I am privileged to have this unique point of view on the experience of our grantees, donors and partners. I would like to give voice to their perspectives as a steward. I have been involved in local currency projects and decentralized co-operative decision making since I was quite young. Truth be told one of my first memories from childhood was taking minutes for a co-op housing meeting with crayons. As a political science student and as a candidate and organizer for the Green Party I focused on designing decentralized decision making structures. I then worked for Environmental Non-Profits for a bit over a decade. I was first introduced to Bitcoin tech in the context of campaign work for social change. I saw cryptocurrency as a part of a strategy to undermine the power and influence of big banks who financed fossil fuel projects. I began speaking and writing about this in 2015. In the last few years I have done a deep dive into digital democracy and online public engagement processes as the Executive Director of the eDemocracy Network, the non-profit sister organization of Ethelo focused on meaningful public engagement on climate plans and other issues working with local governments and Indigenous communities. I was involved in Ethelo\u2019s platform being used by our Fraud Detection and Defence team to help involve community members and partners having input on projects. I was also a volunteer coordinate for Schelling Point and I am a Librarian in Gitcoins Public Library and look forward to participating in those conversations every week. ",

I\u2019ve seen how these organizations fluorish and also how they struggle in very foundational ways, and see web3 as being a tool to supercharge how we coordinate towards lasting systems change. The work that Gitcoin is doing, as well as how it\u2019s both directly and indirectly shaping the narrative around public goods/regeneration, is incredibly exciting to me. I feel both the power and responsibility as an early adopter to ensure that this narrative-building doesn\u2019t lose sight of its original ideals of collective ownership and community empowerment. As a Steward, I intend to challenge any deviations from these ideals, and ensure that the DAO remains aware of the larger ecosystems that it\u2019s operating in and influencing. Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills I started my web3 career as a \u201cnerdy degen\u201d, diving into technicals of a number of projects that I thought could be good investments. I think this degen training gave me a pretty good lay of the land, and helped me build a solid technical foundation to be able to understand the space and how the technology enables revolution. However like many others, I came for the degen and stayed for the revolution. In the past year, I\u2019ve been involved in a number of DAOs - Protein, and Dream DAO being the most prominent - and I\u2019ve naturally assumed facilitator/project manager/steward roles at each. I\u2019ve been a part of Gitcoin DAO since May, where I\u2019ve been a part of the People Operations team and more recently have also taken on some community management duties. I\u2019ve found so much life from being around the incredible team this DAO has built so far, and the work I focus on is ensuring that this team has what they need to succeed and to thrive. Prior to Gitcoin DAO, I spent about 4 years as an engineer and project manager, and 3 years as a career development facilitator (in addition to the 8+ years of community organizing that I\u2019ve done on the side).

Gitcoin Username: @connoroday ETH Address: coday.eth Discord Handle: connoroday#3518 Twitter: @connoroday0 Statement of Intention / Your Values & Reasons for Joining I\u2019d like to officially become a steward of the GitcoinDAO to help lead us toward our mission of building tools that empower communities to fund their shared needs. After spending over 3 years working full-time for Gitcoin (Holdings), I\u2019ve officially resigned from my position with that entity and am now working full-time for the GitcoinDAO within the Public Goods Funding workstream. The timing is right for me to dive head first into the DAO-native world and I want to leverage my experience to become a leading voice (one of many) in this community. The future of work, the future of communities, the future of identity and reputation, will be decentralized and digital. We\u2019re in a unique position to help shape this future. Gitcoin has emerged as a core pillar of the open source and public goods funding movement within Ethereum, and we need to 10x this momentum to make a larger impact in the physical world. I believe QF is a powerful mechanism that can be leveraged for many use cases and communities, that do not have to be strict public goods - check out my EthCC talk to learn why. Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills I\u2019ve been a Web3 native my entire career since before it was called Web3 (for better or worse) . I went down the Bitcoin rabbit hole in college in 2013 and it influenced my decision to double major in Economics and Computer Science. I began as an intern at ConsenSys in 2015 before Eth mainnet launched, mined Eth in my dorm room, lost and recovered Eth in The DAO hack, etc. I was always passionate about new decentralized governance models Ethereum could enable - see my 2016 blog post on liquid democracy I wrote as a starry-eyed intern. At ConsenSys I spent time doing research, token design, dev rel, partnerships, and more. I spent 1.5 years working on a tokenized real estate platform that was eventually shut down as we failed to raise a series A in the depths of the bear market. Watching ConsenSys grow from 20 employees to 1400, and back down to 500, I learned a lot about \u201cdecentralized\u201d organizational structure, fundraising, and building things users want. I believe these insights will be relevant to scaling a DAO. I began working for Gitcoin in early 2019 when the userbase was growing but we were still exploring the right product market fit. I ended up joining and eventually leading the hackathon and virtual events team, where we grew our community, expanded offerings, and increased revenue by an order of magnitude. I eventually transitioned to spend more of my time focusing on grants/QF, and have shifted into a role where I help lead the Gitcoin Grants Ecosystem Round operations. We\u2019ve grown the number of ecosystem rounds from 1 in GR11 to 14 in GR14, in less than a year. I\u2019ve worn many hats in my time at Gitcoin between biz dev, operations, marketing, product, support, dev rel, sales, and more, but every role was focused on growing Web3 communities and funding meaningful work. I have a deep understanding of the Gitcoin platform, community, and mission. I plan to do my best to ensure the success of Gitcoin, our DAO, and our community for years to come! ",

I have a lot of experience that I use to regularly contribute to Gitcoin as a well-informed steward and instigator of the OpenData Community. Raised by civil rights activists, I\u2019ve always had a healthy disrespect for authority and an appreciation for the community building that change requires. Along the way I was an early board member of the Earth Island Institute, nurturing \u201cpublic goods\u201d using the tools we had at that time.  I was invited into that role thanks to my work helping to grow one of the first large dual or triple bottom line companies in San Francisco, then known as Working Assets. Fast forward many years and I became one of the more prolific creators of open-source infrastructure projects and their sponsoring companies as a 4x founding CEO. And then, inspired in no small part by Gitcoin, I pulled the ripcord and shifted to web3 in 2021. In the Fall of 2022 I became an active part-time contributor to Gitcoin - focusing on open data.  As explained on the Gitcoin Forum here the OpenData Community can help Gitcoin achieve its essential intents by decentralizing the analysis & potentially the tools themselves necessary for public goods funding to flourish. I am also thankful to be a public goods operator in the metagovernance DAO, Wildfire.  Via this collaboration, I work with colleagues who are active in governance and governance design across the breadth of web3, from ENS to Bankless and from Optimism and Aave, DAO Haus, and elsewhere.  I introduced Wildfire to our Gitcoin forums here: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-wildfire-scaling-governance-fire-eye-contribution/11005 I intend to be an experienced, analytical, and compassionate voice as a steward.  As an example, in November of 2022 I asked the hard question in public about whether we are collectively spending too much given inherent risks and the macro environment.  This Forum post became one of the most active during the period and has led to a healthy level of introspection.    Is Gitcoin over its skis? should we hold spending flat while addressing unavoidable risks? \ud83d\udcdc Budget Proposals       In today\u2019s Steward\u2019s call, I raised the question of whether Gitcoin might be \u201cover our skis\u201d.  In this post, I\u2019d like to explain my question and offer some evidence in support of the hypothesis that we are actually \u201cover our skis.\u201d  Skiing?   The metaphor to be over one\u2019s skis refers to emphasizing a course of action to such an extent that it constrains freedom of maneuver - implicitly in conditions in which one might want to be able to change direction.

When I compare traditional business with Web3, it\u2019s clear to me that the advantages of web3 are different than traditional business (efficiency, first mover, price, quality, scale, etc.).  Web3 can replace parts of traditional business, but we have to play the game differently.  Web3 has the ability to activate passionate contributors who are united in purpose, it can source talent from a global resource pool, and it can build on the shared successes of peers and competitors as we eliminate zero-sum competition.   That is where DAOs can thrive. It\u2019s not going to be all bunny rabbits, butterflies and sunshine.  There are some really hard challenges in front of us an chief among those challenges is NOT letting ourselves fall into old habits.  There are some solid business tools that we can use in the DAO, but I argue here that we have to use those models judiciously.  If we keep doing what we did, we will keep getting what we got.  And ain\u2019t nobody got time for that. My principles for web3 are best summarize as the following:  shawnlgrubbprinciples1058\u00d7512 80.8 KB  Hats off to rabbithole.gg for the starting point.  When I vote, I follow the principles above. Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills: I come to web3 from traditional business background in project/program/portfolio management in supply chain and IT, but spent my last few years in general management.  I was introduced to the blockchain in 2015 in traditional business, but we pulled the plug on that project when the \u201cpublic\u201d part became clear.  I was started trading crypto in 2017, and mostly bailed out before the market crash in 2018.  In 2020 jumped back into crypto as a technical analyst and swing trader.  After a year of trading full time, I got bored of charts, momentum, and divergence and started to go deep on token fundamentals and that is when the DAO model really caught my attention.  I joined the Index Coop as a contributor 2021 and in early 2022 I was leading Governance Communications and I picked up responsibility for the Human Capital and Culture Pod as well.   I rant/write about DAO thing here and mostly post boomer-memes and governance-themes here. And, I have a keen interest in harnessing the scary power of metagovernance.  Treasury diversification paired with metagovernace can be interesting driver for the web3 ethos. ",

I\u2019m thrilled to be taking on an active role in Gitcoin governance. I have a background in international development and social impact work and fell into the web3 rabbit hole in the spring of 2021. From cross-border remittances to transparent supply chains to fractional tokenized real estate investments to new ways of organizing communities and creating art, I quickly realized the disruptive impact web3 was going to have on most industries as we know them today. I decided I wanted to be knee deep in the action, so to speak. My background has made me naturally interested in web3 public goods and I have been following Gitcoin for a while now. I\u2019m looking forward to getting involved and building together. I\u2019m especially excited about Gitcoin Passport!

I started my web3 journey at Celo and am part of the SheFi community. I\u2019m in lots (too many!) of DAO Discord servers but this is my first time taking on a more active involvement within a DAO\u2019s governance. Outside of the impact side of web3, I try to keep up with some things happening in the generative art space. Nicolas Sassoon is my favorite in that space, but I might be a little biased because he\u2019s French and I grew up in France. Oui oui. It\u2019s great to meet you all, I can\u2019t wait to dive in.

Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills I have been full-time in Web3 for nearly 5 years. In running multiple investment programs during my time at ConsenSys, I have found operating in a way that embraces decentralization, self-sovereignty, and self-organization is extremely hard but well worth it. When I first joined I started with helping to run ConsenSys Labs our incubator to expand the team\u2019s capabilities to support more founders and upgraded the way we allocated capital through Resource Allocation Circles (RAC). Whether you call it RAC, a core unit, a sub-DAO, a guild, or a scout unit, these groups help facilitate decentralized decision-making. ConsenSys and Mesh as entities are no where near perfect but we learned a lot along the way in taking these risks. I wrote a small piece to help highlight some stops along the way we tried to support and grow the DAO space here: A Brief History of ConsenSys Mesh and DAOs | by ConsenSys Mesh | Medium Why now? I see amazing key primitives appearing across our portfolio of of 180+ positions and more broadly with friendly collaborators that tell me we the Year of the DAO may be upon us shortly and we may not need to settle for simple summer-of-X flings. I\u2019m on the board of Tribute Labs, Liquality and have driven our DAO investment strategy at ConsenSys Mesh to join / form / invest in The LAO, Neptune, Dark Horse, Neon, Ready Player, Muse0, PoolTogether and most recently C0C0 DAO. When Gitcoin was being incubated, I led Gitcoin\u2019s resource allocation sessions and still have the materials from 8/16/2018.  I\u2019ve worked with the early MetaMask and Infura teams, been a mentor for multiple Kernal0x blocks and in harder times helped to consolidate, restructure and streamline many of our key investment activities: Ventures, Tachyon, Token Foundry, Strategic Investments, and Opportunity Fund. My current day-to-day involvement is focused on Tribute Labs, The LAO, Neon, Ready Player and C0C0. And casually participate in a few fun DAOs like MADDAO (Moms & Dads), CryptoDADs, and too many genesis groups on tg to count. I\u2019m excited to play a role in both Meta Governance and think there is a lot for Mesh to learn from the group within Progressive Decentralization. Lots of people are thinking about how a DAO functions and I\u2019d like to figure out the ways institutions and groups of people can seamlessly support and grow alongside and within these new structures. DAO2DAO systems are great but DAO2 regular old companies and institutions are likely very valuable as well. Excited to meet more of you and collaborate with other communities outside of the Mesh, ConsenSys Alumni, and Tribute DAO network. ",

My exposure to Crypto/Blockchain space started in early 2017 and I have not stopped learning since. I believe that smart contracts will shape the future of the internet and excited to see where our collective work in Web3, specially around NFTs and Identity will take us. Gitcoin\u2019s work in Public Goods space and democratized model for project funding has surely taken strides to empower developers and lay the proper ground work for Web3 and crowdsourced future. I look forward to days ahead to share my perspectives to the DAO. Qualifications /skills I am currently the Senior System Administrator for Mesh. I manage Mesh\u2019s SaaS system architecture, System integrations, ISMS, Security and User management. Prior to joining Mesh I had a long tenure at Apple where I held positions of Technical Expert, Genius, Lead Genius, and Training Lead. In 2021, I finally made the plunge into Web3 and feel fortunate to join Mesh where we are championing the global adoption of Web3. I hope to learn and grow as I spend more time here and contribute in this space as much as possible. ",

It\u2019s something that\u2019s a big responsibility and is quite a bit of work to do right. But after having been at Gitcoin these past few months it\u2019s been a responsibility I think would be one that would help the DAO as a whole, especially as we make this transition from the centralized grants program to the protocol world. As the Lead for Fundraising and Partnerships at PGF, I\u2019m in a unique position where I get a chance to see things from a different perspective being able to speak to our partners as well as we make this push towards complete decentralization. What Web3 Qualifications/Skills I have: It\u2019s been almost a decade that I\u2019ve now been in web3 for a variety of reasons. It started out with just buying and selling crypto early on to then writing about it for the Huffington Post back in 2013. From there I\u2019ve had a handful of things I\u2019ve tried to launch from launching Kim Coindashian in 2014 to a venture backed web3 crowdfunding platform for creators last year with a mix of things in between. And now that I\u2019ve been in PGF I\u2019ve really had a good chance to understand how different organizations go about governance as we\u2019ve tried to raise capital for grants rounds as well. ",

I\u2019m Collin. I crossed over to Web3 not too long ago in June, joining Mesh for many reasons already stated. After a global pandemic and a decade in corporate tech, along with many others, I felt a sense of tedium and a longing for something more that I couldn\u2019t shake. Was this\u2026 it? Capitalist Realism was biting at my heels. I didn\u2019t just want a day job. I wanted to contribute to something historical; to help solve problems that have never occurred before. So many things in Web3 aligned with my values: democracy, equality, autonomy, transparency\u2026 There\u2019s a sense of novelty, excitement, and nonconformity in this space that feels like it hasn\u2019t occurred since the DotCom era. I sensed I may not have this chance again. So I jumped. All that said, I\u2019m beyond thrilled and grateful to continue my immersion by participating in one of the leading DAOs in the space. I believe Gitcoin will be foundational to the way we interact and operate in the future. I\u2019m fortunate for the opportunity to continue my learnings here and contribute alongside some of the best and brightest. Qualifications /skills Does ordering pizza in college with BTC back in 2011 count? While I was interested in the blockchain early on, I\u2019ve also got about 10 years of People Operations under my belt and lead this function at Mesh. My last gig was building out the nuts and bolts of the People Team at a Series B startup, from early innings to a Fortune 50 acquisition. Some of my background includes onboarding, HR systems, integrations, workstreams, equity, and compensation. In many ways, I like to leverage technology to streamline, automate, and create an ideal user (employee) experience. As I continue to see these similarities and grow in this space, for now I hope to use my skills to help Web3 navigate, and ultimately subvert a world with Web2 rules. ",

I will pay close attention to finances and budget proposals particularly during the bear market. I am keen to find some additional revenue models for the DAO and its people, taking sell pressure off $GTC. Further decentralization. I am deeply inspired by the work done so far to decentralize and turn all of Gitcoin\u2019s once-centralized functions over to the community. I intend to engage closely on proposals that turn core Gitcoin functions (like grant eligibility reviews, trust scoring, Sybil defense, etc) into tools for the community to use and compose with. People. Gitcoin is what it is because of the incredible people it attracts and combines. I would like to see proposals that contribute to the DAO having a deep liquidity of exceptional people, both at \u201centry\u201d levels and in core functions for each workstream.  What Web3 Qualifications/Skills I have:  I have firsthand operational experience with a range of organizational models - startups, nonprofits, cooperatives, traditional businesses, and DAOs of course.

I\u2019m also on the Board of several organizations, so I\u2019m familiar with making executive decisions without knowing all the details. I\u2019ve been a trusted contributor with FDD since July. I helped get the DeSci Round off the ground for GR15. I\u2019ve advised a number of grantees during past rounds. I am a pretty reliable Gitcoin shill on Twitter!

Mutually beneficial trades require a give-and-take of information and commitment. If there are too many parties, parties are distant, or parties are unable to make credible commitments in a fair game/sequence, this process fails. Web2 closed the distance between us (or did it?), and now Web3 has the opportunity to build further upon this while empowering un-powerful people to make credible commitments, even in large groups. I admire Gitcoin as a leader in applying these ideas to reality, to problems that really exist and matter. As Gitcoin prepares to release its protocol to the broader world (Grants 2.0), its successful adoption and ability to shoulder more weight hinges upon the test of reproducible credibility.

I had recently joined ConsenSys\u2019 marketing team and we were hosting @owocki for a Q&A on what he wanted Gitcoin to solve, and how marketing could support the early platform. New to the culture of OSS, I failed to imagine it any different than a Fiverr for open-source code contributions. But since then, Gitcoin itself has expanded upon three distinct and important vectors for web3: (1) By transitioning from solely a holding company to new, if cloudy, world of DAOs; (2) by testing out new funding and voting methods which are useful as political experiments even outside of the world of crypto; and finally (3) creating a protocol (soon ) that even other DAOs can use to better allocate funding. I was invited this past August by @owocki to become a steward and like @Viriya, wanted to get to know the community more before taking on the responsibility. I\u2019m feeling up to the challenge, especially given how grand the mission is. I see so much potential in the way that Gitcoin is approaching the idea of DAOs: communities that can form over the internet and transparently fund public goods. I\u2019ve been reviewing the funding proposals for S16, and also spending more time familiarizing myself with the discord channels (though I prefer the way in which I can get such a good sense of the community by attending a schelling point). I\u2019m looking forward to sharing more of my ideas for the DAO in the coming seasons. Qualifications /skills I\u2019m Director of Content and Communications at ConsenSys, where I\u2019ve been for the last five years. I manage our social, content marketing, and PR teams. I like to think our wordsmiths have helped to educate and onboard millions to web3 \u2013 through MetaMask and other dapps built using our developer tools, Infura and Truffle. We champion the communities, artists, developers, and positive outcomes that decentralized networks already enable. ConsenSys is also taking decisive steps to decentralize its own products and services (check out MetaMask Grants and our intent to launch a decentralized infrastructure network with Infura). We have a new policy to encourage more DAO participation outside of ConsenSys (think Google\u2019s 80/20 rule). I contribute to DAOs in the cultural spaces of crypto as well as DAOs working on novel climate solutions. I can support Gitcoin in matters related to public policy and perception, comms, content marketing, and creative briefs. I\u2019m a passionate educator and intent on sharing the successes of Gitcoin with many more people. Prior to diving down the web3 rabbit-hole I worked in public affairs in China (if you see me at a conference, ask me for my take on politburo intrigue, just not if there is loud music playing). ",

Among my friend groups I am often referred to as the one who \u201cknows everybody\u201d and is \u201calways organizing.\u201d This reputation has come easily to me because of my genuine passion for meeting new people and organizing the communities I belong to. My life has been lived at the intersection of technology and policy. As the son of two retired Associated Press foreign correspondents, I was born while my parents worked in Africa at the time of the Rwandan genocide. Later I spent several years growing up on the Korean peninsula, where the North did, and still does, systematically oppress the political rights of its citizens. We later moved to Washington DC, where my mother was one of the first journalists to use Twitter as she covered the war in Iraq. From an early age, I have been aware of the necessity of community organizing and civic engagement for improving human lives. My career has alternated between political activism and entrepreneurship in web3. Gitcoin\u2019s mission of funding public goods by solving coordination problems within communities is something I would wake up inspired by\u2014and dedicated to work on every day. As a Steward I plan to focus on supporting the following: Communities & Public Goods Funding: My primary goal for participating with Gitcoin is to ensure that disadvantaged and minority communities have the tools & resources they need to fund the issues most important to them. The path toward a decentralized grants protocol makes me optimistic that Gitcoin can empower those that need it most. I hope to be involved and  learn from the PGF & Grants workstreams. People & Progressive Decentralization: People are what power communities\u2014and I love meeting new people! There have been many Gitcoin contributors who have welcomed me with open arms, and I wanted to be a friendly and supportive face for future members. I hope to find new ways for prospective members to contribute and reduce friction for those who want to support our mission\u2014while recruiting link minded individuals to join our journey! DAO/Meta Governance: As mentioned, I am a community organizer, policy-nerd, and news junkie\u2014among other things. I hope to apply my two degrees in political science & administration toward mechanism design and learn from Gitcoin\u2019s impressive roster of DAO-governance experts. What Web3 Qualifications / Skills I have: My passions described above have prompted my success at Penrose\u2014a web3 advisory firm\u2014where I have been a Partner and Head of Community. Penrose is a web3 advisory firm that has been operating for four years and has served some of the top organizations in our industry, including but not limited to: Algorand, NEAR, Oasis, 3iQ, XBTO, Netki, Knox Custody, the Government of Bermuda, the Government of Canada\u2014and numerous top-tier law firms, banks, and consultancies. My work also gave me the opportunity to research and participate in several DAOs. In April 2022 I appeared on the Blockchain.com podcast to share educational content on DAOs and my experience as a Contributor at HODL-PAC, a fundraising community using Gitcoin\u2019s quadratic funding mechanism to amplify grassroots donations to pro-crypto candidates for the US Congress. Most recently I founded a web3 co-working and community hub called ThursDAO that uses DAO methodologies to coordinate our workspace and events. Now I have been \u2018Green-Pilled\u2019 and am eager to expand into the field of impact DAOs at the most respected organization in the space: Gitcoin. Prior to Penrose, I had been a political operative for Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign; a founder and Director of Digital Marketing for a non-profit focused on registering minority voters; the Founder of the LSE Remote Mobilization Unit for Joe Biden; and the Activist Director for my local Florida party\u2019s Environmental Caucus. I accomplished all of the aforementioned activities (and began working at Penrose) while simultaneously applying for, and completing my Master\u2019s of Science in Public Policy & Administration at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). My journey down the web3 rabbit hole began long before grad school, having worked professionally in the space since 2016 where I was an early employee at Canada\u2019s largest ICO consultancy: MLG Blockchain.

I believe web3 has incredible potential to further our ability to coordinate in better ways. I believe in stakeholder decision-making, meaning that communities should have input and power over institutions that impact them, but I also think that formulating the mechanism for this type of decision-making is nontrivial (aka, one-person one-vote is often not optimal). I believe Gitcoin as a community deeply cares about these issues, and for a while I have participated and learned from this community. I want to be able to contribute more in this community in helping Gitcoin to fulfill its mission, but also by helping GitcoinDAO act as an example for how web3 can enable better collective decision making. I\u2019ve enjoyed thinking about this kind of stuff in the abstract, and I think becoming a Gitcoin Steward would allow me to learn by getting my hands dirty. What Web3 Qualifications / Skills I have:  Experimented in the web3 space and followed it on and off since 2019. Tried out some early development in solidity and contributed to the Prysm Eth2 validator client (in golang). Actively writing my thoughts about the space.

I am a Software Engineer at Gitcoin. I work on Gitcoin Passport at the GPC workstream. The reason I build is to give individuals control over their data and control over their money. The great value that decentralized protocols bring to people around the world is something I realized after seeing the power of Ethereum, Uniswap and self custodial wallets. I am a believer of the power of open protocols in web3. This leads me to believe in power of public goods in web3, which leads me to be a great believer of GitcoinDAO. After my experience with the Grants 2.0 protocol and the future of Gitcoin Passport I see a bright future for GitcoinDAO. I want to help get the public goods being developed by GitcoinDAO to the next billion users who are not in web3 or even CT. The long term thinking and steadfast austerity measures employed by GitcoinDAO in this bear market really makes me believe there is high potential for the GitcoinDAO to fundamentally impact sybil resistance and decentralize funding not just in web3 but the world. This is why I want to help as a GitcoinDAO Steward and help other stewards in their goals to further the essential intents of GitcoinDAO. Web3 Qualifications / Skills: I started my journey at Gitcoin with the Moonshot Collective in August '21 as one of the first members. It all started for me with a twitter dm to Owoki. Shortly thereafter, I joined the Moonshot Collective and I met Austin Griffith. I started as a Software Engineer on several Moonshot Collective projects. My first project was Tip.party where I had the opportunity to shape one of the first moonshots and become a part of the rag tag community of builders. As my skills in development grew and I got more involved with ops at Moonshot Collective my roles at the team grew. On the development side I expanded to the backend and expanded to more parts of Scaffold-eth. On the ops side I took on onboarding tasks to guide new Moonshot Collective members. Once the Greatestlarp started I participated as a Software Engineer helping on a massive cross functional team where we coordinated with designers, story tellers, marketing and comic book illustrators. Then I worked on nounsmas.wtf a great collaboration effort between Gitcoin and Nouns in GR12. Then I momentarily worked on a project to show open projects in the Moonshot Collective Github with the first issues board. Following that I got the great opportunity to join the GPC workstream to be part of the team that started Gitcoin Passport. It was my honour to learn, grow and bring my Software Engineering abilities along with my web3 experience to Passport. I have also contributed as a software engineer on the GTC Staking app which was a great effort by GPC and the Moonshot Collective to experiment on staking during GR15. Working on the Passport team I have had the opportunity to work with great individuals examining the great problem of sybil resistance. Gitcoin Passport is the key and it has been an honour to be a core dev on the team. I am someone who has lived in the space of web3 starting from watching Youtube videos to learning how to develop dapps from Nader Dabit, Austin Griffith, then joining a rag tag group of builders called the Moonshot Collective. Now I am a Core Dev on one of the great sybil resistance tools of web3 today. How I can contribute to GitcoinDAO as a steward is by helping find solutions and discussing the problems concerning sybil resistance and what kinds of public goods we care about. These are problems that are near to me. My development knowledge, view of the future of web3 and passion for decentralization empowers me to help Steward GitcoinDAO to empower communities to fund their shared needs. WAGMI! ",

Ensuring that our public goods infrastructure and our strategy as an organization remains aligned with serving the communities who need it most, as well as helping facilitate feedback and accountability from the community as we continue to responsibly evolve into a protocols future, are key parts of my governance philosophy. Qualifications: Since June, I have been a product marketing contributor in the MMM workstream helping conduct research and other tasks advising our go to market strategy for the protocols, with a particular focus on grants protocol. By directly talking to many of the founders and ecosystems we hope to serve with these protocols, I have context into many of the groups that would be impacted by our governance decisions around new products, and would bring those perspectives into public discussions. I\u2019ve also contributed to Forefront and Dream DAO in the past as a media contributor and partnerships / governance contributor, respectively. This has given me exposure to working with the amazing creatives, writers, and theorists web3 aims to empower with new funding and ownership tools, as well as working to onboard young people onto web3. Working directly with many of the different communities web3 serves has given me a sense of responsibility to ensuring that Gitcoin\u2019s protocols remain transparent and accessible, and that a diversity of perspectives are included in their development and the evolution of our products and services as an organization.

I want to see a freer DAO driven future with permissionless decentralised governance as a base layer public good.

As a lifelong student of political science and economics, I see great potential for Web3 to completely change how we coordinate and distribute value. As a full-time contributor to Ceramic, with its mission to create a more open and vibrant web, I find that Gitcoin\u2019s values align strongly with my own personal and professional values. Much of my recent work at Ceramic has been focused on creating systems in the Ceramic ecosystem to more effectively support ecosystem growth & development. In building our grants program & scoping other public goods funding mechanisms, I\u2019ve seen Web3\u2019s need for sybil-resistance firsthand and I believe that Gitcoin (along with Gitcoin Passport) will play an integral role in empowering a sybil-resistant future for all open-source communities. Joining Gitcoin as a Steward means I will be able to directly participate in shaping the strategy at Gitcoin - which I see as an incredible opportunity to help one of the foremost pioneers in the Web3 space that we all so dearly love. Personally, I\u2019m most excited to help drive the workstreams of Public Goods Funding, Progressive Decentralization, and  Meta Governance  as my experience in scaling Ceramic has been all about organizing groups of people and driving towards better outcomes at scale in a distributed environment. What Web3 Qualifications / Skills I Have: In addition to leading the operations & finance functions at Ceramic/3Box Labs for the past year, I\u2019ve been an active angel investor and power user of crypto-related products & protocols over the last three cycles. This has earned me a lot of hands-on experience from working in the trenches in the various communities (across DeFi, Web3 Social, Infrastructure, & Gaming) that I helped to build. I\u2019ve been an active participant in the governance processes across Telegram, Discord, Snapshot, and Discourse at Optimism, BadgerDAO, LobsterDAO, Sushi, Osmosis, Juno, and Cosmos. At Ceramic, I\u2019ve been a committed generalist, gaining experience in everything from running hackathons to driving partnerships to spinning up our grants program. I\u2019ve been heavily involved in Web3 governance having written Ceramic\u2019s governance litepaper and have a deep hunger to learn & experiment with new forms of governance and other coordination mechanisms that are only possible in a Web3-enabled world. Thank you for your consideration in having me as a steward. Cheers, Sam ",

We are rebuilding financial infrastructure, and opening up new opportunities for coordination among large groups of people. I believe strongly that the best technology doesn\u2019t always win; the best marketed technology does. We have to effectively tell the story of web3 products, protocols and opportunities in order to grow their impact. I have been watching Gitcoin grow for a long time, and am a huge fan of the work that\u2019s being done. I would love to help tell the Gitcoin story and make sure that the right pieces are in place to capture that attention and interest, and turn it into more active contribution and participation. What Web3 Qualifications / Skills I have: Before web3, I worked in financial tech. I went down the web3 / crypto rabbit hole in 2016 after seeing firsthand how broken financial infrastructure and systems were. In 2017 I joined ConsenSys as the second member of the marketing organization there. For two years I focused on educating the world about Ethereum. I built a team of writers, video producers, and social media managers; together we worked with SMEs from across ConsenSys to produce educational content in many different formats. We touched all content from ConsenSys. I also worked with every project incubated by ConsenSys - including Gitcoin, MetaMask, Infura, Truffle, and many more. I eventually worked across the marketing organization, helping teams coordinate with each other and developing campaigns to continue telling the story of Ethereum and the apps and use cases that were being built on it. Currently I manage a marketing firm at Serotonin, where we advise and market projects like Polygon, Decentraland, Osmosis, BitDAO, FileCoin, and many more. I get to work with founders & marketers across the industry. I\u2019d love to bring my deep marketing experience and broad view of industry trends to Gitcoin. Very excited about everything Gitcoin is doing and only hope I can contribute! ",

I think Quadratic Funding is really powerful, and as a member of a handful of communities, I see the need for it in many places. For the past year-ish, I\u2019ve been spending a handful of hours at work reading through the Gitcoin governance forums, website, and other resources to try and understand what has been going on with Gitcoin.   DAO governance seems really exciting to me to be involved in, and I think I can help Gitcoin, that\u2019s why I\u2019d like to be considered for Stewardship. What Web3 Qualifications / Skills I have: Before crypto, I have been a designer and a software engineer. I\u2019ve worked in a handful of agencies and also for a couple of startups.  I have enough money to invest here and there too, so you can also think of me as a capital allocator. In web3, I\u2019ve played with ENS, Rabbithole, Gitcoin, Gnosis Safe, and a few other tools. I\u2019m a voracious consumer of information about tokens and I also hold some GTC. Lately I\u2019ve been getting involved in Gitcoin governance. You can see my comments here: Profile - myceliumcoordinator - Gitcoin Governance. My take is that Gitcoin has a lot of potential, but it\u2019s struggling to realize it at this point.   I am cautiously optimistic about Gitcoin, but I think it\u2019s going to get it\u2019s protocols to market adoption to reach that potential. ",

The work that stewards do helps align the DAO on our mission and essential intents in a vastly changing environment, and I hope to contribute my learnings, observations, and insights back to the DAO through Stewardship.

Gitcoin has both, thanks to the mission-aligned hard work of everyone in this community. I have been on both sides of the table, as I participated in blockchain as an investor for most of the time, but I was also fortunate to participate in the building of OKX in its early days. In 2019, I remember I was surprised to find out one protocol I talked to raised some money from community members- not investors- through a platform called \u201cGitcoin.\u201d That was when GR1 happened. Over the years, seeing how Gitcoin has become the \u201csupport hub\u201d for countless projects to flourish is extremely empowering. With OKX partnering up with Gitcoin, I am glad this has come to a full circle, and now we are part of this concerted effort to support open-source developers. Much of this synergy comes from the appreciation of shared values and inspiration of this close-knitted community. That\u2019s why I am very excited to participate as a Gitcoin steward moving forward. My goal here is to listen to and engage with different voices, bring people and resources together, and further strengthen Gitcoin governance with a diverse perspective as an investor, advisor, mentor, and operator of Web3 and crypto projects. OKX will also work closely with Gitcoin to provide activities and resources like Grants Rounds, Hackathons, and bounties. Looking forward to all the fun and engaging conversations!

As a long-time crypto native guy with over 5 years of full-time working experience in the space, I have participated in a variety of governance and DAO projects such as Cosmos, Curve, and Sushi. This time, I am extremely thrilled to join Gitcoin DAO to explore what a ground-breaking DAO should be, and see Gitcoin continue making an impact on the community by supporting the most innovative Web3 projects and ideas. Being a part of such a great organization and exploring the frontier of decentralization is more than rewarding. My experience as a former software developer and as a Head of Ecosystem Development at a public chain has allowed me to gain a more cohesive perspective on Web3, thus providing value through Gitcoin DAO\u2019s Stewardship.

I have also worked closely with engineers, product designers, and blockchain and application developers. Through this, I understand the importance of and have proven to manage and maintain good relationships with both internal and external stakeholders. On top of that, I have been a speaker and organizer of various Web3-focused events in and outside of Asia since 2019. My expertise in blockchain technology has also enabled me to provide consulting services for investment companies and Web2 organizations on Web3 adoption. I have also led a business and marketing team for a wallet app, successfully growing it from scratch to 1 million users and $250M of assets. Currently, I have been managing a Business Development team for an L1 chain for almost two years, collaborating closely with projects in the area of blockchain games and DeFi, and actively helping them to connect with more partners, investors, and even potential team members. I would love to provide more value to the Gitcoin and web3 community through my connections and experience in this landscape. ",

A believer in Gitcoin\u2019s mission and its significant accomplishments relative to public goods funding.  I recognize that this Open Protocol transition and initial round with UNICEF is only just the beginning. The beginning of something huge and wonderful and great. Last summer at ETHCC Paris, during a panel on public goods funding, I asked the question if Energy could be a Public Good? And while there was much skepticism, there were those present who thought so, too. What if we could fund energy as a public good? IMO we are here at that threshold. With strategic and super-smart focus and attention (like the kind evidenced here at Gitcoin) we could work to catalyze innovation that spurs decentralized energy production and deployment. There was a time, in the not-so-distant past of humanity, when the thought of a library filled with books that were made available to the public at large-  on loan - would have been thought to be an unattainable bounty of riches. Perhaps by the turn of this next century, perhaps even within the coming decades, energy will have become another one of these public goods once thought unattainable because of its current scarcity.  Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills  I am the co-founder of FrontierDAO. As such I am the first female co-founder of a DeSci DAO. My experience with government contracting and public-private partnerships  could offer value to this next phase of evolution of Gitcoin, quadratic funding and public goods funding. I participated in GR15 so am by no means a seasoned expert on how QF works. But I learned enough to know that it is magic, and that the QF formula could make a whole lot of people\u2019s lives a whole lot pleasanter and more enriched (in the sense of fulfilled and purpose-aligned). I\u2019d be honored and feel privileged to be a part of that process. ",

I\u2019ve had the great pleasure to have met and worked with many of you around the DAO, but for those who I haven\u2019t (yet) met: My name is Alex (Al\u00e9 when traveling internationally or online). I joined Gitcoin as a core contributor within the FDD workstream at the end of 2022 and I am deeply grateful that I took the plunge to enter DAO-life.  I have been so impressed by the skillset of the peers I have found here, and even more so the genuine good intent and fearless ideological parsing that goes on in this space. Previously I spent time fighting payments fraud and scam behaviors at a cefi company, and before that fell into risk work at a silicon-based tech start-up.  The reason I joined Gitcoin is the same reason that I think brings all of you here in one way or another-- public goods are good. And as a friend advised me as I was in early talks with @DisruptionJoe and @tigress - \u201cGitcoin is kind of like the living room of Ethereum.\u201d I\u2019ve found that to be true and I love that I have the opportunity to work to make that living room environment a fun and fruitful place for all of the amazing, future-leading projects in the ecosystem. Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills: The skills I have used so far in my role as a contributor include on-chain mainnet and L2 analysis and more traditional data science practices. I am deeply excited to be hacking on ways for us to get our data into shape and prep for the hypergrowth that\u2019s coming, and I see a huge opportunity for increased metrics of success to guide stewardship and course-correct strategy.  Transparency != legibility, though - just because we\u2019re in blockchain doesn\u2019t mean we have the numbers and the heuristic data when we need it! So my intention as a steward is to help drive legible and actionable takeaways. Since my background is in risk - I also am here to offer perspective on all things risk and trust-related.  I am excited for how we\u2019ll see this \u201crisk mindset\u201d entering every level of what we do to make sure we have a fair system for all. More on that to come! ",
