The gathering led to a lot of further discussions and there is a request to create a topic for \u201cwallet ux\u201d on https://ethereum-magicians.org. Should we create a topic for this effort in this forum, or should we create a more general topic for UX? What is the interest level for either one? Hopefully creating a topic for this will facilitate the creation of a working group, and the development of standards and/or guidelines for UX. ",
