The Real World Finance Core Unit (the \u201cCore Unit\u201d) recommends that MakerDAO (\u201cMakerDAO\u201d), with guidance from the Real World Asset Committee (\u201cCommittee\u201d), review the following legal structure to implement financings in the United States and, subject to tax review on a case-by-case basis, other jurisdictions. This memorandum does not address any Maker token holders\u2019 individual tax circumstance. Given the decentralized nature of Maker, the Core Unit prioritized (a) the ability of the Maker community to exercise \u201ccontrol\u201d over real world activities and (b) minimizing tax leakage upon repayments of interest by the underlying borrowers (directly or indirectly) to Maker. The Core Unit proposes to cause the formation of a Cayman Islands Foundation Company (\u201cFoundationCo\u201d) under the Foundation Company Law of the Cayman Islands. FoundationCo will have substantial organizational and operational flexibility under the Foundation Company Law and can, as a legal matter, be structured in a manner to satisfy the MakerDAO\u2019s requirements and/or concerns. Further, FoundationCo will avoid many of the existing uncertainties and complexities associated with utilizing Cayman Islands trusts:   there is not a requirement for a charitable beneficiary,   there is no risk of unlimited trustee liability as the foundation company does not have trustees,   FoundationCo\u2019s organizational documents permit the use of arbitration to resolve disputes in respect of its organizational documents,   FoundationCo will avoid some potential adverse treatment from countries unfamiliar with trusts, and   the absence of a trustee means there is not the need for a mechanism to replace and appoint a new third party trustee.   While the Foundation Company Law is a reasonably recent construct in the Cayman Islands (2017), the Cayman Islands Companies Act applies to foundation companies to the extent not specifically addressed in the Foundation Company Law. As a result, the foundation company will benefit from the existing jurisprudence in respect of Cayman Island companies. Interestingly, the Cayman Islands did adopt some of the beneficial aspects of trusts in the Foundation Company Law. Namely, the \u201cfirewall\u201d feature of Cayman Islands trust legislation gives the foundation company protection against adverse judgments by foreign courts in respect of the structure of the foundation company and the transfer of assets to the foundation company. In addition, like trusts, the foundation company may apply to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands for opinions, advice or directions. Legal Entity. FoundationCo will have a legal personality similar to a Cayman Islands exempt company. Purpose. FoundationCo may have any legal purpose - commercial, charitable, private or any combination. Minimum Capital. The Foundation Company Law does not have a minimum capital requirement. Members. At the time of its formation, FoundationCo will have a single-member shareholder. However, the Core Unit recommends, as permitted by Cayman Islands law, that FoundationCo not have any shareholder members. FoundationCo will, at that point, become a fully, bankruptcy-remote, orphaned entity. When FoundationCo ceases to have a member-shareholder, the Foundation Company Law requires FoundationCo to have at least one supervisor. Supervisor. The supervisor will have those powers (limited) set forth in the organizational documents for FoundationCo. The organizational documents may provide that the supervisor carry out the decisions of the Maker Community. The Maker Community may elect and replace the supervisor. If the MakerDAO approves the concept of FoundationCo, the Core Unit will propose the scope of powers to be granted to the Supervisor. Directors. A board of directors will manage FoundationCo. The board of directors may constitute one or more persons (a director could also be a corporate entity). Any person of full capacity may be a director and the Foundation Company Law does not require a Cayman Islands director. The directors will owe a fiduciary duty to FoundationCo. The Maker Community may elect and replace each of the directors on the FoundationCo board. This will satisfy, at a minimum, the MakerDAO\u2019s preference to have an independent director. FoundationCo\u2019s organizational documents will provide for the rights, powers and limitations of the directors. The organizational documents could, for instance, require the directors to verify a Maker community vote on a specific matter before taking (or not taking) any course of action. If the MakerDAO approves the concept of FoundationCo, the Core Unit will propose the scope of powers to be granted to the board of directors. Beneficiaries. FoundationCo may or may not have beneficiaries. The Core Unit recommends that FoundationCo have Maker DAO as the Foundation\u2019s exclusive beneficiary. Secretary. FoundationCo must have a secretary who is licensed or permitted under the Companies Management Act to provide company management services. The secretarial position will be outsourced. Registered Office. FoundationCo must have a registered address. The registered address may be the same as that of the Secretary. Cayman Tax. The Cayman Islands does not impose corporate or income tax on foundation companies. FoundationCo may register to be a tax exempt entity and then apply a tax undertaking certificate that will guarantee its tax status in the Cayman Islands for thirty years. Accounts. FoundationCo is not required to file or audit its company account. Funding of FoundationCo. Maker may make periodic loans to FoundationCo on such terms to be agreed. These loans may, for instance, reflect the underlying loan made, indirectly, by FoundationCo to the real world asset. Annual Fee. FoundationCo will have to pay an annual fee in the Cayman Islands. The current annual fee is $854. Subsidiaries. FoundationCo may form one or more subsidiaries within or without the Cayman Islands. For transactions to be undertaken in the United States, the Core Unit recommends that FoundationCo organize, as the sole member, a member managed, Delaware limited liability company (\u201cDelaware LLC\u201d). Delaware LLC will be the legal entity making loans to the actual real world borrower. As a member-managed limited liability company, the operating agreement of Delaware LLC can be a \u201cflow-through\u201d of the decision-making processes at FoundationCo. In this way, the directors of FoundationCo will direct the decisions made at the Delaware LLC level. For transactions in other jurisdictions, for example, the European Union, it may be more advantageous for FoundationCo to organize a subsidiary in another jurisdiction. Cross-Border Tax. U.S. Federal Income Tax Delaware LLC. The Delaware LLC will be a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless FoundationCo elects to \u201ccheck the box\u201d and have Delaware LLC treated as a corporation. As a disregarded entity, Delaware LLC will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax and, for the purpose of U.S. federal income tax, FoundationCo will be viewed as the entity receiving interest income from the underlying borrower. Foundation Co. FoundationCo itself should not be subject to United States federal income tax so long as it is not \u201cengaged in a US trade or business\u201d. \u201cTrading in stocks or securities for the taxpayer\u2019s own account\u201d is expressly excluded from being \u201cengaged in a US trade or business\u201d. The term \u201csecurities\u201d generally means any \u201cnote, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness, or any evidence of an interest in or right to subscribe to or purchase any of the foregoing.\u201d On this basis, FoundationCo itself should not be subject to United States federal income tax. However, to benefit from the securities trading safe-harbor, FoundationCo must assure that its loan trading activities amount to trading securities and not loan origination. Absent any facts indicating that Foundation Co was involved in arranging, the purchase of loans (secondary market acquisitions) should be considered the purchase of securities and should fall within the securities trading safe-harbor. However, if FoundationCo is treated as originating a loan (either directly or indirectly) then such loan origination may expose FoundationCo to US federal income taxes. Further, to the extent FoundationCo is regularly in the business of making loans to US borrowers, negotiating loan documents in the US and engaging in other regular and systematic business in the US, FoundationCo may itself be subject to US corporate income tax (21%) and a branch profits tax (30%). To address this risk, there may be multiple FoundationCo and Delaware LLCs organized on a deal-by-deal basis or, at a minimum, after a few number of loans. The acquisition of securities (e.g., US Treasuries) on the secondary market will be considered a passive activity and FoundationCo will not be considered as engaging in business in the US for tax purposes. Withholding Tax on Interest Income. Generally, the underlying borrower will have an obligation to withhold a 30% tax on the interest it pays to FoundationCo (indirectly through Delaware LLC). This 30% tax applies to cross-border, US-source \u201cfixed, determinable, annual, or periodic\u201d (FDAP) payments. These payments include interest, dividends, and royalties. Because FoundationCo should not be \u201cengaged in a US trade or business\u201d and therefore outside the jurisdiction of the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), the FDAP tax law imposes the withholding tax obligation (and liability for nonpayment of the tax) on the payer rather than the recipient. The payer, as a withholding agent, is required to deduct and pay any required withholding tax and report the payments and withholding to both the recipient and the IRS. Notwithstanding the 30% tax on FDAP, FoundationCo may qualify for the \u201cportfolio interest exemption\u201d. The \u201cportfolio interest exemption\u201d exempts certain interest income from U.S. withholding tax. Each loan made by Delaware LLC will need to incorporate the \u201cportfolio interest exemption\u201d requirements. These include:   The debt instrument is in \u201cregistered form\u201d (basically meaning that the identity of the holder of the debt instrument (i.e., Delaware LLC) is registered by the issuer (i.e., the Borrower) or the issuer\u2019s agent or the debt instrument is held in a book-entry system \u2013 i.e., the debt instrument is not a bearer instrument);   FoundationCo does not own 10% or more of the capital or profits interests of the payor of the interest (i.e., the borrower);   FoundationCo provides the borrower (as payor of the interest) certain documentation regarding the recipient\u2019s non-U.S. status, including IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; and   FoundationCo is not a bank.   To mitigate any adverse tax consequences, Delaware LLC may require that the underlying borrower gross-up its payment of interest to include the withholding tax. This may be a point for commercial negotiation as it will increase the underlying borrower\u2019s costs and the borrower may require a more efficient tax structuring. In addition to the tax consequences for Delaware LLC, there are further legal issues in the Cayman Islands to consider. Cayman Islands \u201cInternational Tax Co-Operation (Economic Substance) Act\u201d The Cayman Islands recently enacted the \u201cInternational Tax Co-Operation (Economic Substance) Act\u201d (the \u201cAct\u201d) to ensure the Cayman Islands\u2019 commitment to the OECD\u2019s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Inclusive Framework. The Act mandates that all Cayman Islands entities (subject to limited exceptions) must satisfy certain economic substance requirements in the Cayman Islands and submit an annual return to the Cayman Islands attesting to that satisfaction. Cayman Islands trusts are currently exempt from the economic substance requirements application to foundation companies and other companies. If FoundationCo makes equity contributions into Delaware LLC (as opposed to shareholder loans), FoundationCo will qualify as a \u201cPure Equity Holding Company\u201d under the Act. As a Pure Equity Holding Company, FoundationCo will have to demonstrate that it has adequate human resources and premises in Cayman for holding and managing equity participations in other entities. The Cayman Islands has issued guidance that states that a Pure Equity Holding Company may engage its registered office service provider in the Cayman Islands to satisfy this reduced economic substance test depending on the level and complexity of activity required to operate its business.The requirements for a Pure Equity Holding Company are lower than those for a Cayman Island company engaged in a financing business outside of the Cayman Islands. Ogier (Cayman Islands) and Latham & Watkins (US tax) have advised on certain matters addressed in this submission. The Core Unit has not investigated other potential structures utilizing legal entities established in jurisdictions that may benefit from a treaty with the United States for the avoidance of double taxation. There may be legal entities in other jurisdictions that afford the same level of flexibility as the Cayman Islands foundation company. However, such jurisdiction by jurisdiction review is outside the scope of this submission. ",

I had a question on the gross-up you mention:     christiancdpetersen:  To mitigate any adverse tax consequences, Delaware LLC may require that the underlying borrower gross-up its payment of interest to include the withholding tax.

Of course, a sophisticated borrower would then seek to have the loan made by Delaware LLC made from a more tax efficient jurisdiction to reduce its costs. This type of back and forth is common in international lending transactions. I only identified the mitigant for purposes of completeness.

IMO the trust model is superior because there is actually a level of certainty that it will behave as expected (with the assumption that we can trust the trust companies and their legal frameworks) and in general it seems so obvious to me that the trust model is the perfect fit for a what a project like Maker needs, as it is the closest thing to a \u201csmart contract\u201d in the legal world, where actual hard recourse against the collateral exists.

The Trust still has a limitation in what Trustee accepts to do and need to be supplemented by more autonomous third parties. In this case, MakerDAO will be the beneficiary and will be able to discuss with the Foundation through the blockchain. So we guess it will be easier (but probably not enough, we will see). It is our view that the Foundation gives us more flexibility to express exactly what we need with no clear downside except the name. From the Ogier memo:  image850\u00d7463 139 KB  ",

                    "content": "The trust model has both its advantages and disadvantages. As an advantage, you correctly point out that the trustee will act as expected. At the same time, this is a disadvantage, as the trustee will generally not act without instruction from someone (a natural or legal person). One other potential disadvantage of the trust structure, and one of the reasons the Cayman Islands created the foundation company construct, is that trusts tend to be cumbersome and, at times, complicated to operationalize. In terms of the \u201crogue\u201d actor, this does present a risk in either scenario as both the foundation company and the trust require a person (or persons) to make a decision. Remember that trusts do not independently act without instruction. There are potential strategies to address the \u201crogue actor\u201d scenario. And in the first case, it is important to specifically identify what scenarios need to be addressed. On the assumption that \u201crunning off with money\u201d is probably the most relevant concern, there are contractual mechanisms to address this risk . . . including contractually binding written directions re funds flows, requiring more multiple signatories above certain amounts (or any amounts) and/or requiring the sign-off an independent director. After discussions with Cayman counsel, we concluded that the foundation company concept may afford more structuring flexibility to Maker than the Cayman STAR trust. Cayman counsel advised that we NOT use the charitable trust. I am unclear what you mean by \u201cactual hard recourse against the collateral\u201d. Neither the trust nor the foundation company structure creates this recourse. This recourse, if any, is created by perfected security interests under applicable law. I have added a link that provides a summary of the differences between a STAR trust and a Cayman foundation company.    HSM \u2013 27 Jun 18    STEP TQR: Cayman Foundation v Star Trust - HSM The Cayman Islands introduced the foundation company (FC) into the body of its law on 19 October 2017 through the Foundation Companies Law, 2017 (the Law), marking the long journey from novel concept to reality.

                    "content": "Thank you for the questions. In the case of a DAO as lender and any off-chain real world assets, a borrower default presents a unique set of issues as the lender will have to take real world actions against collateral (if any). This is obviously different than a code-based smart contract. This situation presents itself in either the trust or foundation company model. We are working on the governance aspects of the foundation company, but in terms of real world actions against collateral, it is reasonable to anticipate that any actions to enforce against collateral will be done at the direction of a Maker DAO vote. This is not disimiliar to what a trustee will require. For Solar X specifically, Maker will want to preserve the power purchase agreement . . . which is the sole source of revenue. But, from my perspective as a project finance lawyer, this is not any different than any other power project or other similar energy project that is dependent on one or more long-term offtake contracts. This right to preserve the PPA is typically effected through a direct agreement with the offtaker, in which the offtaker agrees not to terminate the offtake agreement without giving the lender an opportunity to cure the default. Obviously, the reliance on the power purchase agreement vs a collection of receivables or the potential for new tenants is a material difference between project finance and other types of financings (receivables or real estate). In terms of oversight during construction, Solar X can be requested to provide written updates on the construction process. In the absence of an independent engineer to verify those reports, the lender will have to rely on their accuracy. Of course, the lender can mitigate this risk further by either (1) engaging an independent engineer to verify the reports (only a cost issue (which in my experience is typically paid by the borrower)) or (2) making its loan at the completion of construction. Option (2) clearly eliminates the associated construction risk. In terms of oversight during operation, there are many potential options from comprehensive oversight (e.g., if there was technology-related risk) to none at all (where the facility is plain vanilla and with proven technology). Given that solar farms are not, compared to other power projects, technically complicated to construct or operate, it would seem that Maker may not require the more comprehensive solutions. But as we have not yet embarked on the negotiation of the loan agreement, I will admit that I have not sought out any comparables to benchmark this particular issue. I hope that I have responded to your questions. ",

Shouldn\u2019t the Maker Community take the same approach for all Construction Projects? How does Deutsche/Nomura conduct/maintain oversight of a construction site in London/New York? I can\u2019t imagine they hand out money and let the builders do as they please. But I could be wrong. And what happens if Solar X goes over budget ? Construction projects can be opaque. How does that work? Will there be covenants that include a renewal or extension of loan terms, extension of additional credit, or a restructuring with, or without concessions? Just wondering. Also, should the Maker Community have policies/procedures that dictate when collateral valuations should be updated/revised, and maybe keep up with credit review? I mean market conditions change right, and a borrower\u2019s financial status can easily deteriorate. We have seen this movie before haha Alright I think we might have gotten out of subject here  ",

When the project will be up and running, there are many monitoring platforms that are often used by solar project managers which Maker could (maybe?) have access to which would simplify things greatly.
