Conceptually, BLS12-377 is similar to BLS12-381, however, it has several interesting properties that BLS12-377 has that BLS12-381 does not. For example, 377 supports Halo-like proofs without trusted setups, and can provide many of the benefits of recursive proofs. We have high-quality implementations of BLS12-377 in Rust and Golang (in-progress). I will be on the ACD call tomorrow to share some more of our plans, and talk about how we can contribute time and resources to geth and openethereum integration of both EIPs.
