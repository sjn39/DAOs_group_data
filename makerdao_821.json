Back in September 2019 I unfortunately encountered a bug in Metamask and/or the Nuo Network Dapp that mistakenly sent 57,729 SAI (DAI at the time) to the 0x00 burn address instead of the Nuo Network deposit address. The process was automated through the Nuo Dapp and in one confirm transaction click the SAI was gone. None of these funds were ever recovered, although I have been told solutions were implemented by Metamask to stop this bug ever occuring again. My question to you - is there anyway to recover these funds or reverse this transaction before the eventual SAI shutdown? Transaction shown below: - https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2083f7492a38fc2b6c1200d3b528fbd0dffa51d406e254a7fd9a67b6ba5dec36 Thank you for your time, Callum ",
