Paragraph Summary Set the upper limit way above the size of the surplus buffer (a.k.a. defuse the MIP84 bomb).  Motivation  Risk has commented on the loss reserves needed for on-chain assets, but not real world assets. It remains unclear where the loss reserves for real world assets are suppose to come from. Leveraged purchase of stETH puts Maker in serious risk of insolvency in the case of a market downturn. The size of the Surplus Buffer already limits our ability to invest. See 1 and 2. It would be good to raise the Dai Savings Rate above zero to grow the demand to hold DAI. It would be nice to return some money back to MKR holders through flap auctions. There is pending engineering work:  DssKiln is not deployed in production yet We need a detailed analysis of what happens to \u201cprotocol owned\u201d vaults in the event of Emergency Shutdown      New Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit parameter The new Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit parameter shall be set to 1B.

This would prevent the Protocol Owned Vault Emulation (POVE) described in MIP84 from purchasing staked ETH assets until the surplus buffer reaches approximately 1B Dai (exact amount depends on Risk CU\u2019s choice of negative lower limit for the surplus buffer). The motivation for this proposal comprises risk factors of investing the surplus buffer into stETH, raising the Dai Savings Rate, increasing the likelihood of MKR Flap Auctions and engineering considerations around implementing MIP84. This MIP is contingent on MIP84 passing. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here. This proposal is eligible for the November Governance Cycle.
