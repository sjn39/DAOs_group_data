Main Text Relevant Threads  MIP61: Delegate Compensation Initial Delegate Compensation Trial Signal Increase Max Delegate Comp Signal Addition of Performance Modifier to the Delegate Compensation Trial Signal Delegate Compensation Breakdown November 2021 Delegate Compensation Breakdown December 2021  The initial Signal Request that approved the Delegate Compensation Trial implemented a three-month trial period. During the trial period, we recognised that initial parameter requirements were too harsh, and subsequently introduced the Performance Modifier to the trial via Signal Request, and this has been added to MIP61. As things stand, MIP61 has not been submitted for Formal Submission, as there are still a few changes being discussed. Consequently, January 2022 is the final month currently covered by the trial and compensation for Recognized Delegates would cease after this month. We are proposing a six-month extension to the Delegate Compensation Trial. In the event that MIP61 passes during this six-month period, we propose that the Delegate Compensation Trial should end and the proposal contained within MIP61 should take precedence. This change would mean that Governance has approved compensation for Recognized Delegates until the end of July 2022. If you have any concerns, or suggestions for changes to MIP61 please participate in the thread linked above.  Pros  Greater certainty for Recognized Delegates. Allows time for MIP61 to be finalized and submitted through the Monthly Governance Cycle.   Cons  Potentially commits MakerDAO to a further 6 months of Protocol Expenses without the passage of a MIP.   Poll    Should We Extend the Delegate Compensation Trial  Yes - Extend the Delegate Compensation Trial by a Maximum of 6 Months, but end it if MIP61 is approved No - Do Not Extend the Delegate Compensation Trial Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This Signal Request will run for two weeks until Monday, January 31. If the result is a \u201cYes\u201d vote, then an on-chain poll will follow. ",
