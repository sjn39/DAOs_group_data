Personally, I would target something closer to 200%, with a stability fee of ~10%. Debt ceiling is difficult to say. but I would consider anywhere between 5-15million. In particular, the high marketcap of LINK gives me pause. The total supply (including the non-circulating portion) is north of $3 billion. This has such a high predisposition to collapse that I think the only way to hedge against that would be with a significantly higher liquidation ratio. And even at 200%, I\u2019m personally against including LINK with a 0% stability fee at inception. ",

Aave offers a 150% collateralization ratio for LINK backed loans with a borrowing rate for stablecoins at 2-3%. There\u2019s $18.5M in LINK deposited which is 37% of Aave\u2019s market size and 46% of Aave\u2019s TVL, I think a big reason for such high usage is that Aave uses Chainlink reference data networks as their price feeds creating mutualistic relationship for both projects, so imho if Maker doesn\u2019t offer similar competitive rates, LINK may not get used as much as expected. That being said, I don\u2019t see much of downside to adding LINK. It has no blacklisting or backdoor, it is a native Ethereum token, and it has a real utility within the DeFi space growing in usage. Arguable about its fair valuation, but as far tokens go LINK seems to be an obvious and relatively safe choice. MCD was supposed to be about multi collateral vaults right? ",

For that reason I think we\u2019re better off starting with relatively low risk parameters, and then likely adjust them upwards once we do the full risk assesment. Otherwise we may see little to no effect from the onboarding at all and the action will be pointless. Something to keep in mind is that the first impression will be really important. If LINK is seen as being added with pointless risk parameters, that impression will stick, even when they are later adjusted through the proper risk assessment, and it could hamper usage in the long term.

Present BAT stats: Debt ceiling: USD 3 million Liquidation Ratio: 150% Stability Fee: 0% Purely based on BAT stats, LINK will have the following stats Debt ceiling: USD 6 million Liquidation Ratio: 150% Stability Fee: 0% The auction parameters of auction lot size, bid increment, auction duration and liquidation penalty should be identical for both coins. The above is only a brief face to face comparison of the two coins. Since MCD was launched with BAT as the initial collateral type new information has surfaced with regards to behavior of holders of this coin: BAT holders are highly reluctant to leverage the token. Even at 0% stability fee, only around 12% of the BAT debt ceiling is currently utilized. This could of course be caused by BAT holders not being aware of the possibility, or (more likely) it could be that BAT investors are the type of investors that does not take advantage of such opportunities, unlike USDC holders for example. It is also possible that the reason BAT is underused as collateral is because of the very low debt ceiling of USD 3 million. What whale or VC bothers to get out of bed for such a trival amount? Even if your bet pays off it won\u2019t even cover monthly expenses of champagne or sugarbabes. Planet_X recommendation: We go with the below revised stats for both LINK and BAT. Multiply the BAT debt ceiling by 10x and see if that draws in major BAT token holders, at least this will get their attention. Same for LINK. If this fails to generate interest it will be a learning opportunity for the Maker community, as focus needs to shift towards more financially literate communities. Proposed BAT stats Debt ceiling: USD 30 million Liquidation Ratio: 150% Stability Fee: 0% Proposed LINK stats Debt ceiling: USD 60 million Liquidation Ratio: 150% Stability Fee: 0% If the psychology of LINK holders prove to be a better match with the opportunities of leveraged finance compared to BAT holders, we can always change the LINK debt ceiling at a later stage.

If that actually gets used up we\u2019d be in a very dangerous place where another Black Thursday-type crash could easily create tens of millions of DAI of extra bad debt. Remember that these assets probably have at least an order of magnitude poorer liquidity than ETH, and are more volatile and correlated to eachother (and ETH). This is increasing existential risk which is not currently justified IMO. I liked your base case of 3mm and 6mm debt ceilings much more. ",

Ultimately, may pacify short term needs, but won\u2019t serve its purpose come liquidation and providing system wide support. Just have a hard time seeing who\u2019s the buyer in the event of liquidations. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m excited at the diversification, and the link team have been doing hard work in the ecosystem (props!) but these are my reservations. LINK is risky due to the following reasons:   Extremely high market cap says that it\u2019s deflating is likely to happen in a bull market as a way for realizing profits (stab in the dark here btw).   Halving / Bull-market is going to then draw the market to run up in the majors at first. BTC/ETH. As these start running, it\u2019ll exponentially consolidate liquidity from all the alternatives. LINK I would think is going to sit in this category, and be consolidated.   In this situation you\u2019ve now got Makers system at risk both financially and also reputationally (bad stability --> bad sentiment --> rinse/repeat). I believe the latter could be just as important as it\u2019s likely going to be all eyes on Maker for it\u2019s next move.    image946\u00d72048 202 KB  Nuo for example was paying 30% on USDC compared to others (the pic should show). This is because the risk is priced on the asset liquidation. So while people probably supply it but the systemic issue only gets larger. ",

I was just commenting on BAT comparison. There are similarities in a sense both are eth crypto tokens and correlated to the crypto market. Probably not much else? Also, BAT parameters are quite arbitrary and were never adjusted in it\u2019s history. I don\u2019t know much about LINK, which probably means i have conservative bias (debt ceiling). ",
