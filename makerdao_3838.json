See here: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c2-sp16-adding-maker-portfolio-core-unit-mpcu-001/8996/73?u=gala   Sentence Summary Add a Maker Portfolio Core Unit to build a portfolio of publicly traded, real-world financial assets that the Maker Protocol can be exposed to with the primary goal of diversifying Maker\u2019s dollar-equivalent reserves away from just the PSM.  Paragraph Summary The Maker Portfolio Core Unit (MPCU) will be tasked with creating and onboarding partnered legal entities that can provide the Maker Protocol with exposure to securities of its choice as a means of diversifying our dollar-equivalent reserves collected by the PSM. The MPCU\u2019s role is to find and implement legal, low-effort workarounds for Maker\u2019s inability to join legal agreements or pass KYC requirements of counterparties. The MPCU\u2019s primary goal is to be a way to drain/refill the PSM facility to minimize the risks of holding undiversified, zero-yielding proxies for dollars in the form of fiat-backed stablecoins (currency only USDC). Secondary goals are to provide regularly scheduled revenue to the protocol and generate goodwill while we integrate with the real-world financial markets.  Statement of Problem Core to Maker\u2019s success is its commitment to \u2013 and successful maintenance \u2013 of the fixed exchange rate of 1 DAI for 1 USD. Because this commitment is paired with the free flow of capital into and out of DAI, Maker has little direct control over the size of the DAI supply. When capital inflows are large because DAI is desired, the PSM is currently the main method of keeping the fixed rate of exchange at 1 USD per 1 DAI. While this mechanically works very well, the PSM has shown an ability to accumulate enough of a dollar-proxy (currently USDC) that can present credit risks and negative PR. The Maker Portfolio Core Unit (MPCU) will facilitate the diversification of those holdings, so that when the PSM has excess liquidity or so much of a single asset as to present risks to the protocol, those holdings can be deployed into actual dollars instead of just on-chain proxies. Alternatively, if the PSM is in need of an additional liquidity buffer to defend the exchange rate, real-world dollars and dollar-equivalents can be wound down to refill the PSM.  Strategy The MPCU will utilize simple legal structures to give Maker exposure to assets it would hold were it a legal entity. Initially, this will take the form of creating charitable trusts, which will only be allowed to operate in a prescribed manner. These trusts will be a \u201ccaptive\u201d customer that Maker can create and establish rules for, ensuring that interests are aligned and minimal monitoring is required. The initial approach is that for each lot of securities, a trust will be formed with a charity named as the beneficiary. That trust will be allowed to borrow from a vault created for a token only that trust will have, or some similar structure. The trust then takes the DAI, converts to USD on the open market, and proceeds to have a broker purchase securities for the trust. The stability fee for the vault will be less than the yield on the security, thereby leaving some profit for the trust, which will then be donated in full to a named charity, removing any tax liability. The trust will be able to pass KYC requirements to purchase securities through standard brokerages, but will not be required to KYC Maker in turn through the characterization of its financing through one of several possible methods (just as Nexo does not need to send Maker a 1099 or perform KYC). Each trust will only purchase one batch of securities, and proceed to hold them to maturity, providing both Maker and the charity beneficiary with predicable, regularly scheduled income. It should also generate good PR and general goodwill through Maker\u2019s charitable givings. Any subsequent desired exposure by Maker \u2013 even to the same securities \u2013 will likely be done through a new trust, as the instructions are unlikely to be alterable after its creation. This strategy represents only the initial phase of the MPCU, and will evolve as new legal opportunities present themselves (such as this one in Nebraska) and as Maker grows confident it can invest in higher-yielding \u2013 but still very safe \u2013 securities. The issuance and sale of DAI on the open market at scale should exert downward pressure on the peg, thereby indirectly transferring liquidity from the PSM to the securities purchased by Maker\u2019s charitable trusts. Even if liquidity is not removed from the PSM, the use of these trusts should lower the amount of liquidity that would have otherwise entered the PSM. It should be noted that this structure is unlikely meet the needs of the market being addressed by the RWF unit or the RWA Company, which require much more oversight and complexity to both monitor the collaterals, satisfy borrower demand, and minimize tax events for profit-seeking entities. The MPCU will only oversee investments directed at publicly traded securities, and will not include private securities in its mandate. There is no envisioned overlap between MPCU and RWF in terms of universe of investable assets. The primary focus of the MPCU is to reduce risks associated with undiversified reserves holdings, with secondary focus on yield, and tertiary focus on charitable contributions  Unit Structure This team will initially include a single individual (the facilitator). No further full or part-time employees are currently planned. Legal and accounting expertise will be outsourced to full-time practitioners. This CU will not handle invested funds or control investment decisions, as that would centralize too much control over large sums of money.  Core Unit Mandate Identify Investments The MPCU will identify publicly traded securities that are appropriate, profitable, and possible for Maker to finance. This largely requires reading financial statements, reports, and research relevant to the universe of investable assets (publicly traded securities). Promising collateral will be recommended through the collateral onboarding process, including asking for a standard assessment from the Risk CU. A general summary of risks will also be presented by MPCU at each onboarding proposal, but it is important that a party unconnected to onboarding a collateral provides an assessment to the MakerDAO community. Initiate Investments The MPCU will ensure that the appropriate structure is used for charitable trusts, including but not limited to ironclad instructions on the trust\u2019s purchase and borrowing, naming the charity or charities requested by MakerDAO, aiding the corporate trustee with choosing a custodian for financial assets, and generally making sure documents are drafted and the trust established so that it can buy and hold the desired investment. This is expected to be fairly inexpensive, routine, and outsourced to professional legal experts and managed by professional trustees. Monitor and Report The MPCU will provide regular updates to MakerDAO on the status of charitable trusts over their expected lifetime. MPCU will also periodically confirm that the appropriate collateral asset is still held in the trust\u2019s account. General data and statistics will also be provided whenever possible, so that MakerDAO can track the revenues, TVL, and charitable giving of the charitable trusts it establishes.

Similarly, during the time DAI is outstanding, the collateral in the vault is a special token created by the trust so why is it worth anything?   The trust documents are legally binding. The idea is to make it simple with the trust authorized to borrow once, make a one-time purchase, and spend the rest of its life collecting the coupon and repaying the loan. The trust will bear its own administrative expenses, and the remainder will be given to the designated charity. Each transaction is envisioned as a separate trust, so we never have to fiddle with SFs and each trust is isolated from the other for simplicity (different maturities, rates, etc).     Planet_X:  what jurisdictions   For now, South Dakota in the United States.     AstronautThis:  What prevents Maker from setting the stability fee to essentially capture all the value and leave zero profits that go to charity   Well, the trust will be instructed to pay whatever we set initially, so if we ask for more, the trust can\u2019t pay it. It will be tightly bounded on what it can do and should have no incentive to deviate. The instructions will not be alterable for the most part, once set in motion. It\u2019s strictly a borrow-buy-repay mechanical process. That of course means the initial structure is only suitable to fixed-maturity (so we know when to wind down the trust), ultra-safe (so no liquidations), publicly traded (so price is easily monitored for those who care) assets. It is possible further legal innovations will allow for more flexible arrangements. But there\u2019s $21T in Treasuries and many, many billions in AAA-rated bonds out there. So there\u2019s plenty to work with. ",

Talking out of school - just my idea - what Nebraska adopting the UCC Article 12 draft (will be law around 9/10/21) is it recognizes most crypto as a specific intangible asset that can be transferred and can be used as collateral and how one could perfect a security interest on it (by filing or control/possession).  What I had suggested to Paper is we could have a structure set up for charities that the charity sets up an LLC governed by Nebraska law with an operating agreement form we provide that as part of its terms states the member interest is represented by a token we create.  The token\u2019s terms are mint X amount of DAI with a below market SF of only .99 or 1.0%.   The operating agreement explicitly provides that the LLC can only obtain a loan by depositing the LLC member interest token into a designated vault, invest through certain brokers designated in high-end bonds, pay the interest to the charity net of the broker\u2019s fees, and pay Maker\u2019s SF.  Seems like a massive PR opportunity. If by chance something goes haywire with those highgrade bond investments the member token could be kicked and sold much like the liquidations protocol right now, where the final aspect is a bid-down of portion of the token and the auction winner owns or partially owns an LLC with bonds.  The charity isn\u2019t hurt, it got whatever it got along the way. ",

Duplication would not be an issue as redundancy is important for a DAO anyway. We are working on a similar idea you can check our Trust model - Work In Progress . Lately, we are aiming toward a Cayman Foundation. Plenty of questions to be answered before doing things. Here are some bottlenecks that need to be solved:  interest rate risk: either you go short term (up to 2 years) and you don\u2019t earn enough to anything significant (0.25% before all the fees) or you take interest rate and liquidity risks. If you buy 30-year term bonds you might get 2% but if rates go to 5% and you have to sell after 5 years, you are taking quite a loss or be unable to keep the peg. It\u2019s one thing to make an experiment with People\u2019s Company for 20M and 5-year (and/or SolarX). It\u2019s something else to invest $1B of the balance sheet. mark to market issue: if you invest in publicly traded securities you have to find a way to keep the P&L and balance sheet of MakerDAO in good shape. Not something MIP21 can do right now.  I know everyone is excited about Trusts lately, but I think the long-term play should be on-chain. Properly tokenized RWAs are coming, and I see the job of RWF to bridge the gap and work to move the ecosystem forward. There is a reason why the RWF mandate is wide for some people. Because everything is linked.    MIP39c2-SP1: Adding Core Unit (Real-World Finance)   The mandate of this Core Unit is to bring real-world finance concepts to MakerDAO; Those concepts encompass but are not limited to:  Investing in Real-World Assets (loans, bonds, structured finance, \u2026) Yield curve implications in DeFi Accounting, solvency, and potential regulatory reporting    But I agree that, lately, RWA is more about reducing the PSM-USDC than the rest.

Holding to maturity also insulates us from interest rate risk. You are correct that we would need to target 7-year up to 20-year bonds at the moment, to get enough yield. The life of these trusts is capped at 20 years, so any longer-dated issuance would need to already be seasoned and not mature beyond the trust\u2019s lifetime to avoid market and interest rate risk. I should also note that this is a crawl-walk-run plan, and I fully expect further innovation to help us find even more flexible arrangements.

They are required to distribute a minimum amount of their net income to a beneficiary (typically the grantor, though we will be distributing it to a charity along with the remainder at the end of the trust\u2019s life). Typically these are used by wealthy individuals to retain the income from an asset that they would like to allocate to a charity. Because any remainder goes to charity, it is treated as tax exempt (though it does still need to file). This particular vehicle was chosen because for low-yield assets like Treasuries or AAA bonds, the NIMCRUT\u2019s distributions are based on net income and not total assets. This avoids needing to sell part of the assets each year, which would expose us to significant interest rate and market risk. Even were the trust taxed, all net income is being donated anyway. Typically only the remainder at the end of the trust\u2019s life is donated with these, but in this case we have no easy way to get net profits from the trust to Maker. That is why Maker is simply providing a vault \u2014 to avoid KYC \u2014 and is not attempting to be the beneficiary. There are a variety of reasons why the trust won\u2019t need to issue a 1099 to Maker \u2013 which is where it would need to be KYC\u2019d in this relationship. The first is simply that Maker is not a US taxpayer, and 1099 is the IRS code for a US taxpayer. The second is that only most services (and the sale of fish, apparently) require 1099. The fees attached to a vault are probably able to be characterized as related to goods sold (crypto is classified as property, not currency in the US) or as SaaS, so there\u2019s a second layer of not needing to issue a 1099, even if for some reason Maker was deemed a US taxpayer. There may be creative ways to directly make Maker a beneficiary in the future. But the initial plan is to be very simple and giving a charity an extra $50k per year is hardly going to make us look bad. The details sounds complex when reading on a forum, but the idea is to create our own customer. That customer can only obey rules we drafted for them, and has no shareholders who will be tempted to find ways to squeeze us once they have Maker\u2019s financing. It\u2019s almost the inverse of an asset originator who creates an SPV to go out and borrow \u2013 we are creating a charitable trust in order for us to approach with financing. ",

The former has to deal with the excise tax issue you raise (as well as sometimes having the state\u2019s attorney general sniffing around), but not the latter.  An aspect of U.S. trust taxation that can be helpful to the Maker Community in trying to diversify and invest in the real world but avoiding tax obligations is that a trust can deduct dollar for dollar from its taxable income a donation made to a charitable purpose defined in IRC 170.  IRC 642(c). That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t issues - my example of a charity forming an LLC, there would need to be certain terms in the operating agreement so that the charity doesn\u2019t blow its 501(c) status by forming it, such as a requirement that if there was a liquidation of the LLC it would be for fair market value - the Maker online auction procedure provides that.

That is why the structure proposed keeps the trust required at a far lower level than the existing RWA models. The trade off is that it is not suited to as wide a universe is investments, but has the benefit of being very easy to monitor and removing any incentives of our counterparty to act against Maker. Note that if Maker wanted to stay purely with trustless solutions, that would limit growth. But the decision to allow trusted assets alongside trustless appears to have already been made. So the question is how to do it in ways that are safe for Maker, and also very mechanical where humans need to make few decisions as possible.

At the moment, there looks like a lot more regulatory overhang for synthetic versions of publicly traded securities, and it\u2019s not always clear how you\u2019d build a mechanism that will always behave as expected. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible, though! In fact, that kind of \u201crisky\u201d experimentation is a perfect complement to the activities proposed by a MPCU. This structure is best suited to high-quality fixed income (though you could likely shoehorn other things into it if we wanted the risk of the underlying investment), so is intended to provide a lot of ballast in forms other than USDC to the balance sheet. When you\u2019ve got a few hundred billion in Treasury notes or near-AAA grade bonds to steady the boat, it\u2019s a lot easier to try other wild and innovative new things that then can\u2019t sink us in a worst case scenario. Let me know if you have any other concerns or thoughts! This is supposed to be a no-frills structure that\u2019s both transactional with a single purchase per trust, and leaves all counterparties in a fiduciary position and without the ability or incentive to pull the rug once they\u2019ve got financing. Its simplicity is core to its transparency and lack of moving parts to break, but it\u2019s v1.0, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s improvements we can make over time to make it even safer and even more flexible.

I would imagine this CU would be ready and willing to provide KYC/AML.   So the idea is that the CU\u2019s main purpose is to start new trusts. Other than some reporting to the DAO and proposing new trusts, its involvement pretty much ends there with any given trust, as it never handles the money and the corporate trustee is paid by the trust\u2019s profits. The trust itself should have no foreseeable issue passing KYC. It will be a legal entity in South Dakota. The trust is also the one generating the DAI through the vault, which is why it needs to be a NIMCRUT or some other trust that is tax-exempt (that DAI would be zero cost basis and then sold for $1, creating a taxable event that would swamp any gains). The trust will, of course, file a tax form every year, even though it doesn\u2019t actually pay any taxes. The main hurdle is likely to be getting a relationship with an exchange where the cost structure for something as conservative as Treasuries isn\u2019t imperiled by high fees to swap or withdraw. But I\u2019m confident with a variety of options and the prospect of regular business, it can be done. We would, of course, test out a small one of these first before even thinking about large amounts, to make sure there\u2019s no hidden issues.     flipflopflapdelegate:  future regulations that could label DAI as a Security Token, or even worst, illegal   If the government wants to bring down the boot, it can already reach our largest holders. One of the goals of this unit is to begin a program that builds constituencies for Maker in the form of both charitable giving (that can be made to align with our mission, or simply a worthy cause that would be materially impacted by the donations) and in holding government debt. Never underestimate the ability for politicians to look favorably upon those lending money to them. ",

Should we cap ourselves at what we have in the PSM or just as long as the peg holds?    At the moment, safety is the most important thing (rule number 1: don\u2019t lose money), and these vehicles have a maximum lifespan of 20 years. So the universe of investable assets is fairly narrow with enough yield and enough safety. To minimize risk while still getting a positive yield, I would initially say the middle part of the Treasury curve is likely a good spot where there is enough yield for Maker to get some return while also having the trust enjoy enough profit to pay its bills + make distributions to worthy causes.     Aes:   How much have you investigated means of doing this on-chain? I would imagine synthetic treasuries are coming in the near term on synthetix, mirror, or elsewhere    Synthetic securities have recently come under increased scrutiny. They may be worth exploring, but I wanted something where there is no counterparty to cry foul under any circumstances. Also, the strategy for this CU also includes charitable and government financing components that bleed into marketing and lobbying that purely on-chain transactions would not have. And on-chain active trading is definitely outside the proposed mandate for the MPCU.     Aes:   Given how fast this space is evolving, how do you think about the opportunity cost of locking up capital to generate returns and scaling this effectively? If we hold to maturity but figure out ways to generate high returns in the interim, we will experience interest rate and liquidity risk as Seb mentions    If using freshly minted DAI, there isn\u2019t much opportunity cost. While this is intended to produce positive returns, it is meant to perform a support function \u2013 provide a floor of expected revenue on a schedule, relieve pressure on the PSM by allowing an alternative method of producing large quantities of DAI against stable dollar assets, build support for Maker in communities served by the charities selected, demonstrate to governments that we can help in stabilizing financial markets and not the crypto cowboys that all blockchain projects are caricatured as. As far as non-monetary opportunity cost, these are designed to be \u201cfire and forget\u201d with each trust being a single transaction. So the overhead to monitor these, since they will be with governments or at least public companies that already have regular audits and disclosures and readily available information, should be minimal.     Aes:   How much of our BS should be invested in treasuries compared to other bond instruments or yield opportunities long term? What\u2019s the appropriate mix?    I think this is a conversation for the DAO, and while I have personal opinions, a specific strategy or allocation is not needed for the MPCU to be useful.     Aes:   What do you think about investing in the CeFi yield opportunities? Coinbase is offering 4% yield on USDC and guaranteeing the principal. Higher rates available for more risk with Circle, BlockFi, etc that are worth exploring.    I think that\u2019s not something I see under the proposed mandate for this unit, for similar reasons as the second question. I think it\u2019s worth pursuing, and this structure might be a good starting point and adapt from there, but it\u2019s just a different animal and will defer to others for the moment. ",

As you realized shorter term maturities of 3m to 6m would be safer, but does the yield of 0.05% offset all the risks around structuring this in a legally sound way? I\u2019d almost feel more confident or flexible when investing in higher yielding short term corporate bonds, if we can find something very safe.

                    "content": "    Primoz:  As you realized shorter term maturities of 3m to 6m would be safer, but does the yield of 0.05% offset all the risks around structuring this in a legally sound way? I\u2019d almost feel more confident or flexible when investing in higher yielding short term corporate bonds, if we can find something very safe.   Unfortunately, the math will not work with the cost structure at such a low rate. At the least it\u2019s estimated the  trust will charge around 10 bps for anything under $15 million in size, and 7.5 bps from $15 to $25 million. Interest rates can and do change, so perhaps there will be less demand or more supply at the front end of the Treasury curve in the future. I would like to see us attempt slightly higher yielding (but still very safe) dollar-denominated debt like agency debt and certain corporates. I propose Treasuries as a beginning point for a few reasons. The first, is of course, that it exposes us to not much more risk than we have just by being pegged to the dollar. The second is that it is simple \u2013 it is an instrument we do not even need a broker for. The third is that it is such a deep market, we can use it to scale should we want to increase supply to help manage the peg. The fourth is the PR aspect \u2013 \u201cMaker: lender to governments\u201d and the novelty of using the government\u2019s own debt to fund whatever causes will earn us the most goodwill. As to supply, note that fixed income in general will not only provide us with regularly scheduled income far into the future, but also future demand for DAI (the trust would need to take USD it receives in interest and buy DAI to repay debt to its vault). How helpful would it be to know that the week of June XX, 20XX, there will be XX million DAI that will be purchased on the open market? It won\u2019t replace the PSM for fine tuning, but may help us hold less than multiple billions inside it. This is intended to be the first phase of a more comprehensive area of growth for Maker. Larger scale, different investments, and more flexible structure can and will be iterated on \u2013 at the very least, the legal world is rapidly evolving in response to blockchain and DAOs. I recognize this CU\u2019s program would be a significant shift in the DAO\u2019s real world involvement, beginning to spread funds around for political self-defense and actually doing business with governments and traditional markets head-on instead of remaining in a self-imposed isolation. I want to take this program in small steps in recognition that it may take the DAO some time to digest that Maker has become financial evolution\u2019s favored child. That the very idea is controversial with regard to using the US government\u2019s funds own debt funding to send cash to underserved causes tells me not to push further until skeptics can see firsthand that profits, generosity, and integration into the heart of the financial system will provide benefits to everyone involved. I deeply appreciate your support, and most (perhaps all) of your suggestions are already a priority for the middle- and long-term for this CU. If there\u2019s a way to move forward when they get implemented, I\u2019ll do it. ",

For example, the trust may pay Maker 110 bps to buy bonds that pay 140 bps. Of that 30 bps left to the trust, the trust will pay the expenses of administration, filing tax returns (but no taxes will be paid), and any \u201cprofit\u201d given to charity. We can make that spread as large or narrow as we choose \u2014 particularly if we are willing to pay the trust\u2019s expenses. It is only assets inside the trust when it winds down (after it has repaid Maker in full) that are strictly required to go to a charitable organization. In theory, that \u201cprofit\u201d could be given to Maker, but the trust would then need to KYC Maker, which is not possible. Alternatively, an LLC could perform this same function as the trust, but then you have shareholders in the LLC who have an incentive to cheat Maker. A trust has no incentive or legal ability (since we draft the trust documents) to run away with Maker\u2019s money. While this program is meant to turn a profit, the profits should be considered secondary, as they will not be as large as our core crypto and RWA businesses. It can provide a floor to our revenues in lean times, but won\u2019t create a bonanza in good times. This program does offer a large peg management tool without the middleman risk stablecoins offer, coupled with a building of goodwill and political protection. With Maker visibly funding charitable work (from the government\u2019s own debt payments) we will gain advocates for our continued existence. With Maker holding government debt, we ensure that an attempt to outright ban Maker would result in a credit event for the government. TL;DR Relieve pressure on the PSM, get friends, buy protection, grow supply. There will be profits, but profits are not as valuable as becoming integrated with the real world both socially and financially. ",

This typically includes assets at the Federal Reserve, but during the COVID pandemic\u2019s darkest days, the Federal Reserve relaxed that rule. Now the rule is back, so the risk-free rate of return is no longer free money to a bank. This has prompted many banks to shift customers\u2019 deposits into money market funds. Unlike a bank deposit, there are less stringent capital rules for a money market fund, even if the same bank oversees it. Those money market funds need a place to get a return \u2013 any positive return is still a return and risk free returns are still risk free, no matter how small \u2013 and so are increasingly finding their way into the central bank\u2019s accounts in a world where interest rates are so low for short-term alternatives. TL;DR is that regulatory arbitrage has encouraged a migration of deposits from formal bank savings accounts to money market accounts. By altering the label on the account, the funds are once again profitable to deposit at the central bank and earn 15 bps as excess reserves, and there are not a lot of alternatives that earn more and are of similar low risk. You would need to buy and hold a 2-year Treasury obligation in order to achieve a better risk-free return, and then you\u2019re exposed to duration/market/inflation/interest rate risk if you want to keep that cash 100% liquid.

                    "content": "    Doo_StableLab:  So this is literally losing money business for Maker as the profit can\u2019t be returned to Maker.   No. The trust pays Maker a stability fee for the financing. It is designed to turn a profit, not lose money. My emphasis that profits aren\u2019t the main goal of this program should not be construed that it will lose money. Maker loans to the trust at X%, the trust buys Treasuries yielding Y%. Maker gets X%, the trust pays for its expenses Z. Then Y-X-Z = what is given to charity. We can make that amount as large or small as we wish, as long as we do not charge the charitable trust more than the yield on the Treasury note.     Doo_StableLab:  Maker does with treasuries won\u2019t make a dent.   The goal is to own 5% of the Treasury market, which would be a run-rate of $30B in monthly purchases. For reference, the Federal Reserve currently makes $80B in monthly purchases. In theory, we are limited only by the peg\u2019s appetite to absorb DAI on the market. In practice, this is likely to be used as a peg management tool rather than pushing the peg to its limit. We would begin with smaller amounts and work up from there. Note that the market readily absorbs large amounts of DAI. There was a day last week when 180m DAI were minted, and half of that was the PSM to hold the peg. At the margin, every million of Treasuries is a million less of USDC.     Doo_StableLab:  In terms of good will, might as well use $300k directly to charity via governance if that\u2019s the main objective.   I think I have failed to articulate that the MPCU is not going to be holding money or making the investments. Its role is to establish the trusts, which can then use financing from Maker. The bulk of the MPCU funding is pay for drafting of trust documents, reviewing them, establishing the trust, etc. The MPCU is more akin to a loan officer than a wealth manager. The trusts then pay Maker a stability fee for that money, which is paid for by the purchase of fixed-income securities \u2013 in this case Treasuries, though if the DAO wanted more yield in exchange for risk, there are other things we could buy. I prefer to start with the goal of making the next billions of stable backing a positive-yielding Treasury instead of 0% yielding USDC. The goal is for tens of millions to go to charity, tens of millions to go to Maker, and to give us stable asset backing aside from USDC. It\u2019s a simple structure that touches upon a lot of areas, so I feel that I\u2019ve not done a good job explaining how this purchase program would work following the parallel threads of peg management, stable revenue, PR/lobbying.

Also, I want to note\u2026 I noticed a mention of off-boarding risk assessment. I believe part of our entire ethos is assessing risk in-house. I mean, look at how we caught the Polygon risks. I don\u2019t see Maker as this like\u2026 \u201chedge fund\u201d which is presiding over managing all sorts of assets, securities, financial derivatives for generating revenue. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s what meant to be\u2026 and again, invites a whole regulatory mess. We shouldn\u2019t rush into generating yield from any and every direction, especially when it involves tradfi assets. I\u2019m open to the idea of bringing in all sorts of RWAs, and we\u2019ll need to, but in a very measured careful way.  Crawl, walk, run   ",

The big hurdle appears to be finding a trustee without a blanket \u201cno crypto\u201d policy, but I believe we already have one whose fees run a flat $7500/year for the first $5m in assets, then 10 bps up to $15m, then 7.5 bps up to $25m. They can prepare and file taxes for $1250/year for each trust. They have also expressed an openness to discounts for regular business, particularly as this structure would require less effort to administer than many complex trusts. If the MPCU is approved, it is estimated to take around 8 weeks to get the first trust operational. Subsequent trusts should be both even less expensive and even quicker to establish. ",
