                    "content": " Questions for Core Units about intangible assets - for review and comment Assets that are created and maintained by MakerDAO funding should as default become public goods for the whole DAO. There can certainly be situations where this is not the case, and asset rights are shared with or given to a specific stakeholder because the DAO benefits in other ways from the funding it provides. However, in such cases it should be transparent for Maker Governance that this is happening and why. While a core unit may support that assets produced utilizing MakerDAO funding by default are public goods for the full DAO, it may be forgotten in the day to day work to ensure that this is fully fulfilled. To avoid that DAO operations are endangered due to asset rights disappearing when a CU/facilitator is off-boarded, we have drafted a set of questions to ensure that there is focus on avoiding that single operators can control important MakerDAO assets and communication channels. We share these questions here for general community review and comment. If you have an opinion on this please put a comment in this month @Core-Facilitators @Recognized-Delegates  Questions These questions are meant to be asked when a core unit MIP has been posted in RFC unless these points already are covered in the RFC submission. Existing core units will be engaged to answer the same questions next time they submit a budget for Governance approval or at an earlier time\u2026  Have you acquainted yourself with the Dai & Maker Trademark Policy, so you are aware of how to utilize the Dai, Maker and MakerDAO names and logos? Which types of tangible and intangible assets will you be producing with the funding received from MakerDAO? Will the assets produced using MakerDAO funding be made available as public goods for the whole DAO?  Specifically: Will appropriate Open Source Software/Creative Commons licenses be applied to the assets produced? Will Copyright for those assets be assigned to the Dai Foundation that has as its mandate to safeguard MakerDAO intangible assets?  Will you integrate the Dai Foundation Contributor License Agreement Assistant in your Github repositories?   Will the source code/material for the assets be made publicly available? How?   Besides the MakerDAO Forum and MakerDAO Discord, which communication channels do your core unit plan to use to communicate on behalf of MakerDAO according to your mandate? Will you ensure that relevant publishing/community websites, email and SoMe accounts and associated DNS and ENS domains used for official MakerDAO communication for which you hold Content Management rights are under ownership of Dai Foundation to ensure ultimate Maker Governance control of who is using these channels? If you register any trademarks to represent MakerDAO funded solutions will you transfer those trademarks to Dai Foundation for safe keeping?  ",
