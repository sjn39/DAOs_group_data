When this work is performed, are engineers responsible for evaluating the economic implications (macro and crypto)? A large amount of the thinking that went into the core protocol, and now going into Casper, Sharding, and so many other initiatives involve crypto-economics. As blockchains become more similar to traditional economies, initiatives may need to also consider macro-economics. How is the community to know that expert economic review has been performed and consensus reached about the feasibility a proposal? ",

The post raises concerns about the need for expert economic review and consensus on the feasibility of proposals, particularly as blockchains become more similar to traditional economies.

As a starting point it may be worth discussing the way this works today. My understanding is that it\u2019s (surprise surprise!) very informal and that certain individuals with experience in cryptoeconomics/incentive mechanism design, such as @Arachnid, weigh in with valuable opinions on the All Core Devs calls. We also get a lot of armchair economists weighing in on the EIPs and on Reddit. Would it be worth considering adding an \u201ceconomic implications\u201d sections to EIPs, where relevant? ",
