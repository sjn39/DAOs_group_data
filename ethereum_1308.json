I thought of using Shamir Secret Sharing but I was thinking how can we do it using multi-sig contracts ",

My own preferred technique today is actually to set up a wallet smart contract that specifies a single recovery address that has the right to call a function that changes the public key. The address itself can then be a not-yet-published multisig wallet created with CREATE2; the multisig wallet would only need to go on-chain to send the single recovery transaction if there is an actual recovery to be made.

Hi @vbuterin Thanks for your approach but in my case, I don\u2019t want to change the public key. It is just a simple forgot password case in which I need to recover the password for the same wallet. In this case I am not sure how multi sig contracts can help. Can you please explain ",

And my scenario is If the user later loses access to their account, they will ask the guardian to restore their access. The guardian will produce a signature indicating their approval. So instead of transferring ownership of the smart contract wallet to a new address held by the user, I want the address to remain the same but just to recover the same password. ",
