Discussed by Stewards and the wider community for over 3 weeks. \n\nAfter engaging with the ICHI community, discussing the potential benefits, use cases, and clarifying the value proposition of using a native stable coin we have gathered enough support to bring it to a vote. \n\n## Voting \"Yes\" \nIf you vote \"Yes\" you are voting in support of a proposal to create a oneGTC token that will be backed by a mix of $GTC and USDC, you are also voting to approve a 45,000 GTC token budget to be allocated for the bootstrapping of the token treasury. \n\n## Voting \"No\" \nIf you vote \"No\" you are voting against this proposal in it's current form. \n\nIf the community selects \"Yes\" by the end of the voting period, keyholders of the Community Multisig will be notified that the workstream payments will be allocated into the oneGTC treasury. \n\nIf the community selects \"No\", no action will be taken at this stage and discussion will continue to find an optimal outcome.",

                    "content": "As a first foray into treasury management in collaboration with the #workstream-discussion:public-goods-funding we stewards, @Yalor, @androolloyd @Pop , @HelloShreyas & @AcceleratedCapital propose partnering with the ICHI community to create $oneGTC:  A stablecoin to accelerate the funding of Gitcoin DAO.  Why $oneGTC will provide the GitcoinDAO with a toolset for generating greater resources that can go towards digital public goods. It will enable a significantly increased value for $GTC token and greater economic freedom for the contributors of the DAO. By using the ICHI system we are able to unlock the value of the token treasury, allowing us to retain more value within our ecosystem and decrease the sell pressure for our workstream contributors.   Having a stable token for the GitcoinDAO allows us to fund work streams with certainty, instead of being victims to market fluctuation.   Using $oneGTC as our preferred token instead of market selling $GTC will lead to retaining more value within the Gitcoin ecosystem (see chart)   A success of this experiment will lead the way to other open-source projects unlocking the value of their scarce assets, Gitcoin should lead the way in empowering communities and helping them unlock their treasury.    What: Following other top projects like Filecoin and 1INCH, we propose partnering with ICHI to build $oneGTC, a stablecoin minted with a mix of $USDC and $GTC.  $oneGTC is a native stablecoin for funding the ongoing operation of the Gitcoin DAO, as well as rewarding contributors new to the Gitcoin ecosystem. ICHI has built the only stablecoin design to be governed by a specific crypto community. GitcoinDAO will govern the $oneGTC treasury, and can apply any strategies it likes to grow it\u2019s collateral, or decide to incentivise activities using it\u2019s earnings. Allocate the next 45,000 GTC outlined here to bootstrap the $oneGTC treasury, with an additional $100k worth of tokens to provide liquidity for the pools, matched by $100k worth of ICHI rewards for LP\u2019s from the ICHI community.   1297\u00d7727 86.1 KB  To learn more read here:  [Proposal] $oneGTC - a stablecoin for the Gitcoin community -  Proposal Discussion - Gitcoin Governance Join an ICHI <> Gitcoin Telegram discussion group   Proposal Stage:  Initial Target: - The first step to delivering this is to get consensus on the value of this proposal, we require a clear signal via snapshot from the token holders to show their support for this treasury scheme. Once approved the ICHI team can deliver the token treasury in 7 business days. Budget:There is no additional budget required to deliver this proposal, we propose using 45,000 GTC allocated to workstreams to bootstrap the oneGTC treasury, with $100k in $ICHI provided by the ICHI community to reward liquidity providers who add USDC to the pools. Plan and Timeline: See plan above, timeline is 10-14 days from treasury deposit. Individual/s Responsible: We are partnering with the ICHI community a few of whom include:  @Lior  @37 Aces, Chief Technical Officer  @masanobufukuoka, Farmer Samuel Mendenhall, core dev Vladimir Stemkovski, core dev Kobayashi, ecosystem Ethan Lehman, community  All ICHI team can be found here. Ultimately they will be responsible for delivering the working treasury scheme and token, and @Yalor & @androolloyd will be responsible for overseeing the work being done and ensuring that it is delivered on-time and within the existing scope outlined above. This proposal will be open for discussion for 2 weeks leading up to the next Gitcoin Stewards Call August 2nd, a corresponding snapshot can be found below:  oneGTC - snapshot vote  Open Monday July 26th - August 3rd. Thank you for engaging with this proposal, even if you just give us your stamp of approval it means a lot. We are here to serve the DAO and hope through the creation of oneGTC to ensure a longer lasting and more sustainable treasury for years to come  Original $oneGTC proposal [Proposal] $oneGTC - a stablecoin for the Gitcoin community ",

The sooner we launch oneGTC the more $GTC that is locked up into the treasury, the less GTC that hits the market, the less sell pressure that\u2019s created. See this comment from @griff  Honestly, I think every token that has a marketplace should make a stablecoin   Volatile tokens can be a speculative store of value (GTC has no economic value) and CAN be used as a medium of exchange but as a unit of account they cause more problems than they solve\u2026 in fact, because of the unit of account issues, the medium of exchange use case is hampered.  A few people have suggested the same idea, that perhaps this would be a better fit in a few months. But IMO as long as we\u2019re making payments to workstreams, which is definitely happening now, we should be exploring the most sustainable and longevity producing schemes to sustain the value of the treasury and ensure that these funds continue to multiply instead of sitting locked idly in the DAO vault. So we don\u2019t expect any downside risks of being \u201ctoo soon\u201d at this time. ",

                    "content": "Q1: Is this a fork of Frax or Titan? A1: It is not a fork of FRAX or Titan.  Quite the opposite: Those projects promote fractionally reserve stablecoins at huge risk to depositors while ICHI\u2019s model is the most over-collateralized model in the market.  It focuses on creating a horde of hodled crypto (ie, $GTC).  Every line of ICHI\u2019s Decentralized Monetary Authority (DMA) code base is original and fully audited by Quantstamp + Solidified.  The DMA architecture is fully described at docs.ichi.farm Q2: How does the 1:1 redemption mechanism work for USDC when GTC is in the mix? (Is there any documentation) A2: You redeem 1 $oneGTC for 1 $USDC (less redemption fee).  You can also swap at close to 1-for-1 on Uniswap V3.  It is that simple!  Nothing else like it.  That allows $USDC to function as a regulated off-ramp for $oneGTC.  If $oneGTC runs low on supplies of $USDC, it must rebalance on Uniswap V3 (or similar) to get more $USDC.  But this is always less than the amount of $GTC that would have otherwise been spent if using any other stablecoin or fiat asset.  Try it here with $one1INCH and $oneFIL: https://www.ichi.org/. Read more here: doc.ichi.farm Q3: I really like the concept of using oneGTC for grants, but how do we get the USDC needed for reserves? A3: It is up to the Gitcoin DAO but here are three ideas to mint $oneGTC while needing to sell very few $GTC: a) Reduce the amount of USDC needed to mint $oneGTC with loans to $oneGTC treasury.  There are two extremes: 1) no loan - this means 98+% USDC is needed at first and the minting ratio may only slowly decline as the treasury earns yields, 2) lend enough to maintain 600+% treasury reserve - this means minting ratio can be very close to 0% (ie, 5%)\u2026 you only keep enough USDC around for short-term redemptions.  Anything in between enables minting ratios from 5% to 98%.  We set the initial proposal to allow an 80% minting ratio. b) Borrow.  You can set up $GTC and $oneGTC lending markets on platforms like wing.finance (an ICHI partner), Aave, and Compound.  Supply the $GTC and borrow $oneGTC or $USDC. c) Options.  There are option financing scenarios that involve no liquidation risk (unlike option b). IMO, the best thing to do is to start simply and get more fancy/complex with scale. ",

I spent a lot more time thinking about this proposal given how many great people are involved and supporting this but I still don\u2019t think it makes sense to create a separate stablecoin for Gitcoin at this stage. There are many other stablecoins that the community can use right now and it can become a potentially complicated, distracting process to make sure this is successful. If one of the objectives is to reduce market selling of GTC, then it might be worth also thinking through if there are other ways to achieve the same objective like staking.

I haven\u2019t seen anything in the post or comments addressing regulatory concerns. I also haven\u2019t seen alternatives discussed (e.g., Uniswaps KPI token idea). Taking a step back, it may be better next step to firm up how this DAO conducts analysis (e.g., with something like yTeams at Yearn) on operational, legal, tax, technical, and other considerations before fairly specific proposals go to vote.

That is why together with the steward we spent time deep diving into all the details, we think the potential value of a success is far greater than the risk taken. Recipients will be able to decide if they want to hold $oneGTC and save with it, redeem it to $USDC or exchange it to $GTC. Then and with analysis of the experiment, the DAO can decide how to take it from there - proceed with more payments, expand for more use cases or wait.

I agree that this technology is revolutionary and groundbreaking and am personally working hard to learn more on the technical and theoretical side but lets be honest. We would as an entire crypto community be a lot less well off without the uneducated retail traders throwing millions of dollars at all the most recent hyped project. I think it would be silly to not put some emphasis on making a token people want to fomo into to as if we don\u2019t we may be leaving a stream of revenue that could go toward the funding of public goods off the table. And almost more importantly be missing out on any future developers who would learn about gitcoin through such a hype cycle. In conclusion dont let the principled stance of a technology first agenda get in the way of what will be best for the long term goal of funding public goods and paying developers ",

People use money to either spend or save it - those who plan to spend it, would do so in both cases, but those who save, will now hold an asset that:  Locks $GTC in it\u2019s treasury Generate yield for the Gitcoin community.  The vision is that at scale, people can do more stuff with $oneGTC - they can pay for contributors in the Gitcoin platform, donate to projects, create income service agreements bonds etc\u2026 the more utility \u2014> the less people immediately sell it cause they can use it and get benefits for prefering the protocol native stablecoin over others In turn - the protocol can encourage people prefer it\u2019s stable medium of exchange to pay for these kind of protocol service, cause it has the collateral generating yield that can potentially fund those rewards     trent:  I haven\u2019t seen any mention of the 2 & 20 fee structure I see in this Loopring AMA from May. Is this not going to be applied to oneGTC? if not, will it be applied in the future? do other oneTokens have these fees applied?   ICHI was build with the oneToken communities in mind. The 2/20 model serve this purpose by aligning the interests of the ICHI community and the oneToken community:  The ICHI community will vote to launch only vetted projects with clear potential for a sustainable economy around their oneToken. Whitelist strategies that has been vetted to be safe for deploying the collateral to work. ICHI community has interest to ensure a responsible treasury management guidelines are followed, increase confidence in the oneToken, and supporting it\u2019s growth  If those are kept - ICHI token holders share the fruits in the form of shared profits With that said, we are at a very early stage. While all oneTokens have this structure built in, since v2 launch, this hasn\u2019t been applied since the focus is on growth and adoption.     trent:  I think the Gitcoin community would be better served tapping into a larger, more established stablecoin (eg. DAI) for now, and potentially revisit this project at another time.   This is one of the most common responses we get [1] [2] - it\u2019s true other stablecoins are more common at this point of time - the point is none of them is serving the Gitcoin community and governed by it - which we believe has lots of merits and value.

The reasons are similar to what was mentioned in the call and above in the post by other stewards. I believe it\u2019s too early in the process to consider creating a gitcoin specific stablecoin while a normal and more established stablecoin would probably serve us better. Even though I appreciate all the work the ICHI community put in the proposal, before looking at this proposal I had not heard of them and I am not really convinced our goals would, at this point be completely aligned. Especially considering the fact that they have their own community to consider first and they have the ability to have a management and a performance fee on top. The 2/20 mentioned above. I think perhaps we can reconsider in the future with a proposal to do this as an experiment. Such a proposal would be to not just mint oneGTC but also to fund a specific project that wants to be funded with oneGTC as opposed to GTC. With such a proposal the whole work of deciding who to fund with oneGTC and who with GTC would be taken off our hands which is good as that would mean less work. And any proposal should mention and have a commitment from the ICHI team to disable/not enable any fees on top. ",

That is why the way I look at it is that the purpose in the fee model is to ensure alignment of interests between the projects - if Gitcoin won\u2019t gain value from $oneGTC - neither does ICHI , and as such the goal is to get to an equilibrium of value add and fair split. This was one of the things I like about ICHI and what made me propose it to the Gitcoin community in the first place. I\u2019m Looking forward continue this conversation in the future! ",
