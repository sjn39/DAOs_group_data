                    "content": " Q4 2022 MKR Decentralization, Delegation, and Distribution Update Commentary on data as of December 31, 2022 (embedded views will auto refresh with updated data). All views exclude Maker-owned addresses that hold MKR. Addresses known to be owned by a single entity are lumped together. . Following is a high level summary of selected MKR governance and decentralization metrics:  1788\u00d7490 114 KB  Most of these metrics increased QoQ, and these metrics are all such that higher is better. One exception is that the amount of MKR direct to governance has decreased, but this is due to the increased popularity of delegation vs direct participation; delegated MKR increased by more than enough to cover the difference. The other exception is that half of the the circulating supply is now held by 19 entities, down from 23. Thus, the concentration of MKR at the top has increased. In the interest of brevity, only the most interesting charts through time of these metrics are explored in this post. Charts for the rest can be found in the dashboard linked at the bottom of this post. . The number of MKR holders with at least 1 token has been continued on its uptrend which began in May 2022 and approaches all time highs:  The majority of the MKR that was left in expired delegate contracts at the end of last quarter has moved into active delegation by the end of Q4:  There is still 4446.6 MKR stuck in expired contracts representing delegators that are too passive in their governance participation to notice that they should re-delegate. As shown in the following views, the long term trend of direct participation shifting to participation via delegation has continued, whether the top MKR holder is included or not:   The count of total governance participants of at least 1 MKR has been steadily increasing, reaching an all time high at the end of the quarter, and most of this increase QoQ is from delegators:  Delegates with more than 1 delegator has been steadily increasing and made notable gains QoQ: from 21 to 24.  . Conclusion  All in all, we have seen slight improvements in MKR decentralization metrics since last quarter A majority of the of MKR in expired delegated contracts last quarter has moved to new delegate contracts. There is a long term governance trend of direct participation shifting to participation via delegation The number of participants of 1MKR+ represented in governance contract has been steadily increasing, mostly via delegation. Delegate counts are also up.  These metrics and others which were intentionally not shown to reduce clutter can be found in this dashboard Appendix A measure of inequality of a distribution, typically used in income distributions, is the Gini Coefficient. Complete inequality is represented as a score of 100, whereas complete equality is represented as a score of 0. The current gini coefficient is 96.80, which represents a high level of inequality. This figure was 96.68 at the time of the last check-in on September 30th, so by this measure, decentralization has slightly worsened.  ",

Will be more deliberate with my choice of words here going forward.     prose11:  Curious if you could elaborate why this metric is increasing while the other\u2019s appear to be showing positive directionality. How much further decentralization is needed to keep the coefficient flat when the largest holder appears to be accumulating?   Great questions! I think you answered the first question in the second. I haven\u2019t looked specifically into which of the big holders are accumulating, but it\u2019s clear that at least 1 entity near the top is accumulating as now the top 50% of circulating MKR sits in 19 wallets, down from 23. I think this had a sizable impact on the gini coefficient, which suggests an answer to your second question: the distribution near the top seems to have heavy influence in the coefficient, so it would probably take a lot of further decentralization.

                    "content": "@prose11, great questions. Regarding the Gini Coefficient, I agree with @lyt. The Gini coefficient is calculated as the ratio of the area between the perfect equality line and the Lorenz curve (A) divided by the total area under the perfect equality line (A + B). The Lorenz curve is the cumulative ownership of the bottom X percentiles for a given X. When someone at the far right side of the lorenz curve (i.e. the largest holders) accumulates more tokens, they mechanically decrease the % ownership of all other holders, which causes the area between the equality line and the Lorenz curve to increase, increasing the Gini Coefficient. In general, if the top holders accumulative more MKR, Gini will increase. There are a few edge cases where perfect redistribution of tokens between all the non-top holders is able to counteract the impact from a large holder accumulative, but these scenarios are highly unrealistic, so I would ignore them.
