They will spend quite a bit of time and effort justifying them. They also don\u2019t have much oversight on spending. MKR holders, meanwhile, are barely involved in budgeting. They rely on Delegates, who are politicians and don\u2019t have a direct stake in spending. Governance also generally isn\u2019t very knowledgeable about spending(partly due to lack of oversight on it), so is afraid of breaking something if they fight too hard against budget proposals. ",
