The Maker Foundation is excited about this, but wants the community to make the ultimate decision on the domain name! Here are some suggestions but feel free to drop your ideas in the comments:  Daicommunity.crypto Makercommunity.crypto Welovedai.crypto  Why is this important?  Puts the DAO in charge of the Oasis App instead of any one person It would give users the ability to interact with Oasis in the case the website servers were attacked or removed by a third party It would give users the ability to interact with Oasis in the case oasis.app was seized by the domain registrar  Please let us know if you have any questions, we would be happy to answer them!

MagoCrypto:  Puts the DAO in charge of the Oasis App instead of any one person   Also, I will say that this is more complex than just putting it on IPFS. If the DAO is in charge of the Oasis App that implies input into the direction, funding, development, etc. Previously the community has not had responsibility for these things and I\u2019m not necessarily sure that the community wants responsibility for Oasis in its current form. When Black Thursday happened, this was one of the reasons I didn\u2019t personally feel that MKR Holders had the lions share of the responsibility. If we did take responsibility for the frontend, that would change. ",

It\u2019s just a way to route traffic to blockchain lookups for blockchain registries and regular DNS for those. Browsers will not easily add support for any alternate registries. They will only do it if they think it is a standard. Collisions from multiple protocols are not a risk because browsers will only adopt when it\u2019s a standard.  Crypto has already achieved this and is being supported by several browsers (coming soon). .Crypto has over 300K domain registrations. It\u2019s the largest blockchain domain registry.  We think it would be really cool to showcase the maker app as part of an upcoming browser launch. What do you think? ",
