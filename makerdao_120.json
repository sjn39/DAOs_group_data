Regarding specific dates, I don\u2019t have any firm convictions, but I\u2019d suggest that a year is too long, and a month is too short. Perhaps in 3 or 6 months time? Regarding specific supply, I have no idea what sort of supply would make the most sense. I\u2019d like to hear from @cyrus as to what sort of risks we start having as the supply falls. Feels like a lack of liquidity is the big risk? Have we any idea at what supply value the liquidity will start to become dangerously low? ",

                    "content": "IF the bridge is left up at 1:1 I see no reason to shut down the SCD.   Just keep lowering the DC and use various other parameters to encourage migration. We have a single CDP holder with 8.2M outstanding CDP 3088 (which has not done anything for almost a year) so I think a reasonable shutdown number provided this user doesn\u2019t close is ~13-15M.   I have expected a distinct slowdown in closures when ~35M hits and expect it will take at least 6 months to get SAI down to ~20M My point here is that the SCD shutdown does NOT have to be a time based close but simply can be an amount of SAI or number of CDPs left to close. The other problem here is that this 20DAI lint limit is keeping a lot of CDPs from closing but honestly I don\u2019t think these are a \u2018big\u2019 deal. Also I was researching a bit on the top 50-60% remaining CDP holders and all but 2 have been active in the past 60 days. I also think a well thought out plan regarding shutdown conditions (or if a timeline which I don\u2019t think is a good idea) should be presented to the entire community (SAI and CDP holders) so everyone has been notified in advance of the possibility of the SAI to lose it\u2019s PEG to the dollar AND the conditions which can elicit a SCD shutdown.   If the DAI-SAI bridge stays open I honestly don\u2019t see a reason to close the SCD down or the SAI peg to be lost. Personally I would just keep lowering the SCD-DC, match the borrow rates between the MCD/SCD or have them be slighly higher on the SCD vs. the MCD and just wait.   Eventually there will be less and less SAI out there and ANY drag on the SAI peg should be driven by the markets on DAI and the available SAI-DAI 1:1 bridge. The fact the rates should match pretty close means basically both systems are run with basically the same conditions and should not present additional headaches for the Maker community.   In fact one could just put up a proposal to tie the SCD rates to the MCD ETH-A SF rates so community only needs to vote on tieing the SCD/MCD system rates, and then vote on the MCD rates in the future knowing the SCD rates will move to match automatically. I do not see any outstanding reason to shutdown the SCD based on time but it should be on other conditions outlined above.   Hence the reason I abstained. ",

Cognitve complexity?   Really?   Just keep dropping the SCD-DC, match the rates between the MCD/ETH SCD and keep the SAI-DAI bridge up.    Announce again that the vast majority of Maker efforts will go into the MCD and not the SCD. Are we so concerned about this that we are happier to burn early SCD users than to take the risk as a community to give them more than ample time to act.   I mean the outstanding SAI is continuing to drop.  Ratio of SAI to DAI 71:41 and growing. I still see people struggling to find SAI liquidity to migrate and people want to close this out in 3 months. I will vote no to any time frame closure and would rather have the SAI outstanding be the key parameter but honestly as the ratio of SAI to DAI decreases the collateral in the SCD at risk becomes less and less of an issue.  (particularly when we hit 90:20 DAI:SAI which I expect will take at least 6 months provided sufficient liquidity can be found) ",

What has been on my mind of late is this idea that IF the ESM is activated from what I can tell there is no graceful way to re-activate the system AS it WAS and anyone wanting their collateral back basically have to obtain the relevant stable coin to claim their collateral? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong here. Is it true if the ESM is activated the entire system (including a new DAI) needs to be re-deployed and every user will have to migrate from the system that was shut down to the new one and a new stable coin will need to be issued?
