We strive for scientific governance which means debating the issues, often when we are in complete disagreement. A good axiom is focus on the idea, not the person presenting it. It is okay to disagree, but it is not okay to disparage. Maker is one of the more mature DAOs around and it is very important that we don\u2019t let aggressive and unhelpful posts tarnish that image. Moderators will continue to handle flagged content, with our preferred method  being to hide offending posts so people can see what content is not tolerated as well as have a transparent record of who the offending party is when moderation occurs. If you have questions or concerns please reach out to me either privately or if you\u2019re comfortable on this thread so others can learn from the conversation. ",
