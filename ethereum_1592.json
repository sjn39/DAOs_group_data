Is there an implicit \u201chigher spec\u201d that they\u2019re both implementations of? One advantage of K is that it can generate text in many styles / forms. Beyond formalization (ie: as an engineer) the YP has LOTS of ambiguities when trying to write an EVM. The JP is very explicit about how each part works. I agree that the YP is nice in that it uses notation from high school math, but it\u2019s also not written totally straightforwardly, and you need familiarity with its specialized style. \u2026but that\u2019s me  I\u2019d very much like to hear more thoughts on the topic  ",
