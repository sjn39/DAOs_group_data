                    "content": "The goal of this post is to gauge the community\u2019s feelings towards implementing a treasury- like construct accessible through governance. Two additional considerations are: do we want to siphon some revenue from vault fees to fund the treasury. And would we want the foundation\u2019s participation, either through partially funding the treasury, or some hybrid control multisig situation? Those discussion would come next if the community wanted to pursue a treasury. The impetus for the poll comes from this thread: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/makerdao-needs-a-treasury-to-provide-compensation-to-its-workers-post-foundation-focus-on-workers-for-now/1091/11  While the contents of the post focus on worker management and some questions around that, a fundamental part of employing people is budget. Currently the DAO has no \u201ctreasury\u201d with available funds to employ someone. The foundation employs or funds the vast majority of people/groups that work on the protocol or related tools. The DAO does however, have revenue from vault fees which goes towards DSR + MKR burn. Again In short, does the community agree with pursuing the creation of a \u201ctreasury\u201d used by the DAO?     Yes No Other (explain below) Abstain     0 voters     Update: So far the consensus in the comments seems to agree with the idea of a treasury. Mkr holders already voted on paying oracle fees from the stability fee according to @LongForWisdom (I dont remember in which vote but i\u2019ll trust him on that), so handling those would be a good place for a treasury to start. In general there is still much debate remaining on how the treasury would be funded/structured and if we want someone to run it. Also the technical smart contract questions remain. Ill leave this thread open until someone tell me to close it ",

There are key responsibility authority positions that will need to be paid for \u201cin the long run\u201d that we can\u2019t expect the Maker Foundation to do.   In fact I am not even sure they would want to do it, or even if they can do it.   Do you want more MKR to be minted or this to be paid from incoming revenues?  Frankly I would rather this come out from DAI upfront than minting and selling MKR for DAI after the fact. Hence Mitote is correct at a minimum we need to establish at least the idea we want a treasury - the details of implementation conditions - to be discussed.   How much, who and how it is used - to be determined. In the loosest sense a person MAY not be required to be treasurer - that we can debate - but all monies should go into and out of a treasury account.   Given Maker is paid in DAI I think we need to start accumulating DAI just to even start to test whether we as the community can agree to proposals being presented for acceptance by \u2018contractors\u2019 and then paying out when they are complete.   IF all financial transactions are on-chain we probably still will want someone at some point who is responsible for giving a \u2018treasury report\u2019 periodically this is generally true with respect to Maker Income and Outlays and general business analysis as well as putting up polls on MIPs to accept as proposals to offer, and proposals to be paid.    We might not need a full time paid position for this, but we are going to want every position to be at least 2-3 people deep for redundancy, illness, death etc\u2026    To train, and have these people available no matter what positions we decide we will still need a treasury. People are suggesting we shouldn\u2019t take money from the SF income now.   I counter with we better start thinking about it now because we are going to need someone to adjust the smart contracts to start putting money away, just to be able to pay for stuff in the future the way we want and why not start now.   The only thing DAI is doing is burning MKR - we surely can slow that down 5-10% (at $100M outstanding this is ~.5-1M DAI worth/yr without hurting MKR burn too much to start paying for things via a treasury model which is funded by SF revenue.)   This could also act as a kind of emergency fund in case something unexpected comes up (like an IP/Trademark defense lawsuit) If the community wants to try to run like a charitable organization - feel free but I can tell you right now from experience since MKR holders stand to benefit from any \u2018donations\u2019 of time and effort to Maker that over time people will see MKR holders benefiting from their work without pay and eventually they will just \u2018go away\u2019.  Eventually unless replenished the MKR foundation funds will run out.    I have seen this over and over and over again with organizations that depended entirely on \u2018donated\u2019 time/work.   Honestly if this is going to be the metric then it is our large MKR holders that are going to have to step up and compensate people.  In the end this kind of approach will lead to further centralization (which imo is not part of the key 5 goals as I see them written). So lets try to be real about this and simply move forward.   I see absolutely no reason why 5 or 10% of the incoming SF couldn\u2019t be set aside towards the treasury when to start that I\u2019d like to start sooner, but sensitive to Aaron on this (maybe we could do 1-2% of fees Aaron?).   As to hiring the first person even part time there should be more than enough from 5-10% and maybe even 1-2% (50-100K DAI/yr) of the SF fees to pay for that and probably some other stuff.    We could try to use the treasury to offload some of the stuff the Maker Foundation is currently paying for and get a more transparent view of actual operational costs.    We also should be prepared to pay for legal defense of IP/trademarks, etc. ",

This is the key part. Many people are currently spending their time on this project (myself included.) Personally speaking while I don\u2019t think i would disappear were I no longer paid, I wouldn\u2019t be able to justify spending the amount of time on this project that I do currently. I need to eat. We will need to have a treasury, and it will need to be funded from the stability fee income (there is no other income stream generated by the system.) While we could mint and sell MKR to fund the treasury, this is functionally the same as using the stability fee income because otherwise that income stream burns MKR. My hope is that the treasury functionality will be on-chain and that we will not require a \u2018Treasurer\u2019 position. Given that I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while, let me lay out what I see as the most probable future in terms of this subject.  MKR Token Holders have already agreed that oracle fees should be paid out of the stability fee income generated by the system. Because of this prior agreement, it is likely that this will be the prototype case. Because oracles operate at least partially on-chain, I suspect that the functionality for paying other on-chain entities using the system debt buffer will be developed. This has the advantage that money will be taken from stability fees when available, and if not available the system will print MKR using the existing mechanisms. Because the oracle fees are an on-going cost, I suspect that whatever mechanism that is developed will be capable of paying a re-occurring \u2018salary\u2019 to on-chain entities. This will almost certainly require a vote by MKR Token Holders. With that proof of concept, we will have everything we technically need to pay arbitrary addresses for services supporting the Dai Credit System. At that stage I predict that either the Foundation or the community will start pushing for a \u2018transfer\u2019 of personnel from the Foundation to the Dai Credit System, probably starting with the Governance Facilitator (assuming MKR Token Holders ratify this.) At that stage \u2018balancing the books\u2019 becomes a thing that MKR Token Holders need to consider, I am doubtful that this will require a paid position as all data will be available on-chain. I actually think it is more likely that we will need a Human Resources type role before we require a treasurer role.  ",

                    "content": "@LongForWisdom I agree.   I am also spending my time here w/o compensation but I have donated my time to other projects that I see I might be able to help move along.  Not being compensated effectively means I can come and go as needed for my family etc.  Which is the best thing about on-line work (in most cases ability to just meet deadlines vs. having a formal 9-5 type job) Sounds like most of us are agreed we need a treasury and it will require a vote.   I think you are right that probably first things to pay for are the oracles.    I think peoples thinking here is that there are other positions we will need to pay for first other than a treasurer since everything will be on-chain and auditable.   Like I said lets just go at this one step at a time and just drive through it with decent thought and care. Agree to make a treasury, come up with consensus on when/how (much) to fund it from fees and then once we have funds and a means to disburse them we can start to think about how the treasury should act, and what recurring fees to take on. In the end pretty much agree with all the subsequent comments here and your well done list above. I\u2019m not sure much more needs to be discussed at the moment other than what level we want the funding to start, and how to implement the mechanics of funding the treasury from SF fees.   Once this starts rolling perhaps we start another thread regarding how the treasury should operate, what recurring fees we should be paying what positions to on-board first, what level of compensation for what responsibilities. I do see that the community needs to pull back and pay for the domain names associated with Maker to put these in the IP/Trademark/community ownership hopper so we should put that in the list above as well. I think the next step after formally authorizing the treasury as well as access/payment mechanics is to get some kind of list from the Foundation of what they see as the first things to off load to the Dai Credit System for management/payment. One thing that came to mind is all this is going to have to go through governance cadence (i.e. authorizing MIPs, payments for work, etc.)   So your right someone to handle governance issues, cadence, managing details of that is probably a key first position.

The protocol already gives MKR governance the ability to pay DAO teams and oracles - a basic function which is necessary for survival of the system. Specifically this is called the \u201csuck\u201d function, which allows governance to do payments out of the buffer. Now one thing that\u2019s very important to understand is that it isn\u2019t safe to increase the size of the buffer to hold a significant amount relative to the total Dai supply. This is why it started off at the low value of 500k. It is necessary because the buffer is distributed to Dai holders in an emergency shutdown (so Dai holders actually get slightly more than 1 USD in an ES under normal conditions). The problem is that if the buffer gets too large, this \u201cES premium\u201d will become an actual incentive that skews the game theory. It could both impact the peg and make it harder to stabilize the price of Dai, or even worse, actually incentivize an ES to be triggered by Dai holders to harvest the buffer. The best way to pay DAO teams and oracles given the constraints on the size of the buffer, is to do payment streaming - paying teams directly out of the buffer on a second by second basis, with the actual transactions happening at regular intervals to ensure that the buffer doesn\u2019t hit its limit and that there aren\u2019t unpredictable swings in buffer size which could impact the liquidity of surplus or debt auctions. This is achieved by using instant access modules, special submodules with a specific functionality that are given authorization to call critical functions like suck on the core system, but within hard constraints that are inherent to the instant access module itself. So e.g. if governance wanted to start paying a DAO team 300k Dai per year, they would set up an IAM with the authorization to call suck, but the IAMs logic itself would prevent it from doing more than 300k per year, on a continuous pro-rated basis. A more difficult question is: How to handle compensation of DAO teams? Does governance choose to pay like wall street, paying top 1% salaries to hire, and retain, world class talent mostly out of financial centers, or like universities and governments paying public servants a lower rate than the private sector, with the understanding that it will be more junior candidates from all around the world, who will have a higher turnover but also be motivated by the prestige and career opportunities that a few years on a DAO team will give them - or a combination of both?

Specifically this is called the \u201csuck\u201d function, which allows governance to do payments out of the buffer.   From the glossary in https://docs.makerdao.com/other-documentation/system-glossary#vat-vault-engine \" suck : mint unbacked stablecoin (accounted for with vice ).\" Unless I\u2019m misunderstanding The suck function mints unbacked Dai. I would need to be convinced that thats a safe and secure (from a social and risk perspective) way of funding labor. Wouldn\u2019t mixing labor costs and a budget in general with the buffer complicate risk questions? To me a simpler design of a treasury would be beneficial. I dont understand the system well enough, but shouldnt it be possible to just divert a set percentage of the value from value fees  (not going to dsr) to an address that the chief controls. The last question is definitely harder. I find it unlikely that there will be one mode of compensation. Different work can have different compensation structures. I\u2019m writing more on this currently so I wont go in to it right now, but I suspect we will go towards a multidivisional structure where the elected head or facilitator of each group are under salary from the DAO and handle compsenation within their division (facilitators get a budget from the dao). This way community/gov stuff is under a different compensation mode than integrations or risk which have different needs/goals. There needs to be debate on a fair capital/labor split of revenue if we are going to compensates anyone. ",
