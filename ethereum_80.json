As of now, one can\u2019t link a physical object to an NFT. We\u2019d like to make a standard proposal we\u2019ve been working on. It\u2019s called Redeemable and it\u2019s a standardized way to link a physical object to an NFT. The Redeemable NFT Extension adds a redeem function to the ERC-721. It can be implemented when an NFT issuer wants his/her NFT to be redeemed for a physical object. Link to PR: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5560 We\u2019re eager for your comments! Thanks in advance. ",

Many different signature, many different usages\u2026   I agree but it shouldn\u2019t be too \u2018restrictive\u2019 though: for instance if we name it redeemPhysicalObject(), people could think that\u2019s the only covered use case, whereas it also can be used to redeem anything (including on-chain assets, tickets, \u2026). We wanted to keep it a bit general.     Amxx:  you should start by explaining de motivation.   Right now if you sell an NFT that\u2019s redeemable for a physical object, you would declare it in the description but there\u2019s no way to verify if the object was already redeemed or not. Also, a marketplace can verify if the NFT is redeemable or not, and also verify if it was already redeemed or not. After the redeem() function is triggered, the marketplace sends the buyer\u2019s physical address to the seller. ",

Thank you very much for your reply.      dohzya:  Hello  I was working on a kindred EIP (Idea: ERC for redeem codes - #2 by dohzya) but it seems like you were too fast (or I was way too slow ). My proposal is focused on securing the redeeming part: how to allow your target user to redeem the token while avoiding anyone else to redeem it. I don\u2019t understand how to do that on a EIP-5560 contract.   No worries, I will give some feedback on your proposal. The targeted use cases seem to be pretty different from each others. You basically want to send some value to someone that doesn\u2019t have a wallet address, and we want to allow an NFT holder to redeem a physical object (artworks, tickets, \u2026).     dohzya:  To make a redeeming secure with a EIP-5560 contract, do I have to pre-assign the token to the right account?   Our proposal works with ERC-721 only. We don\u2019t need to pre-assign anything because the NFT holder address is already known (already minted).     dohzya:  To be honest, I\u2019m trying to understand if we are working on the same thing (if yes I will try to adapt my code to use this EIP) or if we have distinct goals (if so, maybe we both should use a less ambiguous name )   Two different projects with distinct goals here. Like @Amxx mentioned before, the naming might be problematic for both of us.  I think redeem() as a function name is acceptable in our two cases. We can have a chat if you like!
