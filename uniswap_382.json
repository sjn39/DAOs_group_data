My question is, how would we structure it? I created a poll for simplicity\u2019s sake with everything I could think of, but this is by no means an exhaustive list\u2026 And let\u2019s keep it high-level for now! I thought it\u2019d be interesting to gather sentiment and start a discussion about this. How Should UNI Holders/Voters Be Rewarded?     Redirect a portion of LP fees in their respective tokens Redirect a portion of LP fees to a UNI buy and burn Redirect a portion of LP fees to a UNI buy and distribute it to holders Redirect a portion of LP fees to ETH and distribute it to holders Other (please discuss!)     0 voters     One more thing, I know we don\u2019t have control over the fee switch or anything yet, so let\u2019s not be too hasty. My goal here is to help develop a wise, long-term oriented decentralized financial community. In doing so, we\u2019ve got the power to really change the world. Looking forward to hearing from you all! Zer0dot P.S. I\u2019m also not claiming that any of these options are wise, let alone feasible. Let\u2019s discuss! ",

UniSwap is pretty new as a platform and right now there is so many things already going on. I don\u2019t think that burning token is needed for now. Is more something that we should do in the long term once the platform is already well established. Burning token UNI is not going to centralize governance, please remmber that there is a 2% perpetual inflation rate. The two things will tend to compensate in the long run.     dcota:  Wouldn\u2019t option 2)\u201cbuy and burn\u201d benefit the passive holders?   Yes, but UNI holders are the ones who govern the system. The point is, why should UNI holders be motivated to keep enhancing UniSwap? If they are rewarded by a token burn, that would be a good incentive. Since there is a 2% perpetual inflation, if in 1 year less than 2% of the tokens is burned overall the UNI holders are losing value. If more than 2% is burned then they\u2019re growing their value. But since the amount of tokens burned is proportional to how well is UniSwap doing, this is the incentive for UNI holders. ",

                    "content": "I think the question at hand is pivotal and the community\u2019s answer to it will define the future of Uniswap protocol. I voted for ETH distribution and I think that buying and burning is a much worse option than it looks like at the first glance. #1 Let\u2019s talk about what ETH fee distribution brings to the table. It ties the value of the token to the amount of fees the Uniswap DEX generates . What it means in terms of price appreciation is that it establishes the lower boundary of UNI price . It does not push the price up, but it protects the people who buy now and in the future from losing their money to at least some extent. When it comes to mass adoption, this model of fee distribution is a familiar thing for the newcomers from the traditional markets and thus it helps them at being able to make educated investment decisions based on the metrics they are familiar with (P/E etc). For the long term growth it is quite valuable to have a benchmark on what the actual value the protocol generates and captures is. This option would dim the boom & bust cycles of the coin and bring it more store-of-value capacity . It would help to establish steady growth that is tied to the underlying value of the protocol. #2 When it comes to burning the token in isolation , i.e. if we were to burn the UNI tokens from the governance treasury and just reduce the overall supply, that would have a somewhat negligible effect in my opinion:  The emission rate would still outweigh the burning rate, at least for the first years It would be similar to us saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to develop ecosystem in any better way than just to reduce the supply.\u201d  #3 If we talk about buying and burning the tokens, it is a completely different ball game. In effect it introduces Ponzinomics concepts to the token functionality.  In short, ponzinomics induce sell-side liquidity crises. This means there\u2019s not enough supply on the red side of the order book so every marginal dollar entering the system keeps pushing the price up and up /Tony Sheng/  While introducing these concepts would mean price appreciation for the current token holders, it would accelerate the boom & bust cycles for the token. In a rough approximation this would likely mean that earlier UNI buyers and holders would gain disproportionate amount of value at the expense of future UNI buyers and holders, who would get excited about the token, lose money on its bust cycle and typically come to a conclusion that this all is a scam. The key word is disproportionate . The earlier network participants do get a lot of value when the network grows. And if the network grows steadily towards a bigger multiplier, everyone is much better off than when one group takes advantage over the others. In this case it would be earlier buyers taking advantage of later buyers, while the underlying value of the protocol would thin out in comparison to its price. Let\u2019s take a look at a well known example in crypto: Bitconnect. In this case there was 0 underlying value, so the boom part went high, but the bust part made it go to 0. Early buyers made money off of later buyers, later buyers lost money. It was a zero-sum game. When it comes to Uniswap, there definitely is underlying value \u2013 and if things are done right, the network growth would benefit everyone, including new participants of the system . When new participants of the system are not taken advantage of, it creates positive feedback loops that foster mass adoption. And the sum of this game is enormously positive . Now, bringing this game more towards zero-sum game would over the long run on average hurt all the participants of the network compared to an alternative scenario described above. == In my opinion, UNI distribution event is not an another airdrop of a candy wrapper coin, it is an initial value and responsibility distribution . This fork in the road is pivotal for protocol development. And one path brings Uniswap closer to Bitconnect, and another one brings it closer to Bitcoin and Ethereum . ",

The community choosing to burn tokens wouldnt classify it as a Ponzi either and labeling community members who vote against distribution as \u201ccontributing towards turning the project into a Ponzi\u201d is a very dangerous narrative to take. As mentioned before burning and distributing all in all have the exact same effect burning the tokens reduces the number of tokens in supply meaning each token is worth more, yes it means whales would get more money but so would the smaller hands with the exact same amount of tokens but less in supply. Also FYI these whales had to put money into the token to get those tokens so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re exactly being given a free handout. On the other hand distributing tokens would be distributing tokens to the smaller hands but also to the whales aswell either way leaving the small hands in the same position they were in before. All in all they\u2019re much of a muchness and will end up with the same result as mentioned before. ",

You can either have more UNI that are worth less or less UNI that are worth more. Now let\u2019s compare distributing UNI and distributing ETH. It\u2019s true that by distributing UNI we\u2019re artificially pumping up the price since we need to buy them (in the short term). But at the end of the day the users are the one that will decide what to do with their tokens. If a user prefer to hold ETH over UNI he will sell the token that he earned, and so he will create sell pressure. And the same is true if we distribute ETH. We don\u2019t artificially create buy pressure on UNI-ETH. But since some users will prefer to hold UNI over ETH they will use the ETH they earned to buy more UNI and so they will create buy pressure. So, let\u2019s say that 50% of users prefer to hold ETH and 50% prefer to hold UNI. If we give the reward in ETH, 50% will swap it for UNI, and if we give the reward in UNI 50% will swap it for ETH. At the end of the day the result is exactly the same in long term.  Basically what I\u2019m trying to say is that the market will decide the direction of UNI price, not UNI governance. If a reward is distributed to UNI holder then UNI price will go up in any cases. And about the centralization of governance\u2026 that\u2019s going to happen even if we distribute ETH because UNI whales will use it to buy more UNI. So even here, the market will decide.     Snuffy:  Daily volume is not the same thing. I can trade 1 token ten times and the volume would reflect ten trades. but if you burn that 1 token right after the first trade, those ten trades would not happen. day traders buy and sell the same stack of tokens multiple times a day, effectively doing my example on a large scale.   I know, there is not even $1 bilion UNI existing so it would impossible to have $1 bilion UNI in order books. I would estimate that right now the amount of UNI \u201cprovided as liquidity\u201d to exchange is around $100-300 milion, considering $26 milion is on UniSwap alone. So, $300k would still not be a large amount. We can expect the amount of liquidity to 10x once the total supply is circulating. But the point is that the market will adjust itself. And we\u2019re not burning token just for the sake of it. We would be burning token with the value that is produced by UniSwap. That is something completely sustainable in the long term. It would be a Ponzi if we were creating value from thin air, but we\u2019re not. ",

When it comes to burning the tokens is isolation, I don\u2019t think that it does anything meaningful. For the most part is just a Sisyphean labor - to try to deflate a superinfationary economy. When it comes to buying the token \u2013 even without burning it, it does make a dent. Let\u2019s start with some simplistic generalized examples. Having  0.05% UNI fees with 300 mil volume per day, it would mean 4.5 mil buying event for UNI tokens monthly and 54 mil yearly.  In isolation, if we would just buy 54 million worth of tokens on the market, it would not make 554 miilion dollar market cap out of 500 mil m cap. It is more likely that it would bring the market cap closer to 1 bil, but I might be way off in my estimates. Now, add that to the fact that when we introduce the mechanic the sell order books will naturally thin out in anticipation of these events \u2013 and these events will generally become tradeable. Again, for simplicity, it wouldn\u2019t have to be like that, but lets say we offer daily UNI market buys at 1 PM UTC, it would create a daily mini pump & dump event. Over time because of the way market caps work, the UNI market buys and the expectations of these buys would disproportionally pump the price of the token that would stimulate the mania phase around it. People would buy heavily overpriced UNI tokens, and at the end of the day the bubble would burst, and the price would find the bottom around or maybe below the accurate valuation of the protocol. Leaving a lot of unhappy people who lost their money by getting excited over UNI behind.  I\u2019m not saying that we\u2019re going to prevent boom & bust cycles for UNI. I\u2019m calling on not making them worse than they have to be. When we distribute ETH rewards people can still decide to buy UNI with them, but it will be their decision, and they will likely have their personal reasons behind it. I don\u2019t see why the governance of the protocol should make these decisions for the people. If we just distribute the ETH rewards, there will be people who buy UNI with them and people who don\u2019t. This way people have a choice, and this choice will result in UNI supply being distributed more towards people who have decided to buy it. ",

I don\u2019t really have much of an opinion on this as of yet, but I\u2019m leaning more towards distributing ETH or a stablecoin or something to active governance participants. This could be difficult to do, and perhaps contribute against maintaining the stablecoin pegs.

But if they were to be distributed in ETH, they could at least cover to some extent the usage of Ethereum blockchain. If these fees were to be distributed in respective tokens, they would essentially be useless . To transfer these tokens you would have to pay more than they\u2019re worth. It is a form of spam . It is better to distribute money than to spam . #2 As Uniswap is a DEX, everyone can theoretically create a pair and get some volume going for it. So everyone can make a scammy token which will then be distributed to all UNI holders . And it\u2019s not just the possibility, it is the reality. A lot of Uniswap volume for the past month was made by superinflationary speculative mining tokens that naturally go down in price. So when we offer these tokens as a reward instead of ETH, we effectively distribute 50% less value. == So what we get from respective tokens compared to ETH distribution is:  spamming the wallets with dust community exposure towards dangerous projects extra trouble for UNI holders and extra load on Ethereum blockchain when people have to sell 200 tokens they don\u2019t want to own distribution of far less value with the same amount of money  To be honest, it is the most disastrous option out of the ones listed. By far. == The second best option to ETH distribution imo is to buy UNI and distribute it. Again, compared to burning now we give people a choice to own their distributed UNI or to sell it, so over time UNI will be distributed more towards people who bought and who didn\u2019t sell. I am honestly not sure about all the implications of UNI market buys when we add an option to sell what has been bought. ",

And it is easily understood by the newcomers, as by default, we live in inflationary economics (and there are economic reasons for it). If we were to give people an option to have 7% APY on their money in an economy with 7% inflation, most people would feel more rewarded by it than by having 0% in a non-inflationary economy. When it comes to word-of-mouth, imagine a person saying:  Well, there is an opportunity to have 20% APY on your money with virtually no risks. Well, the overall supply of this thing is extremely inflationary at the moment, but it\u2019s getting a little bit less inflationary because it is designed in a way that it burns the money it earns. So in 4 years, the amount of money it burns may exceed the inflation, and then your \u2018stocks\u2019 will benefit a little bit from that with time. Albeit the price movements will still be unpredictable, but life is life taa-taa\u2013ra-ta-ta!  Introducing even a 5% deflation into an economic model that inflates 600% over the next four years seems like a wasted opportunity to me. ",

But the good news is, there is no need to worry about SEC. They don\u2019t come after decentralized organizations, because there\u2019s no one to come after. One of the primary benefits of introducing governance tokens is that you can have security tokens and you don\u2019t need SEC\u2019s approval for it. The staking mechanism is another way to avoid flirting with SEC, when you say: \u201cbut people do work to earn these tokens, these are not dividends\u201d.

                    "content": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share some thoughts in regards to those arguing for a UNI burn with the fee switch rather than a daily dividend of revenues. First off, looking at all of these defi governance tokens that have come to market this year. They have all all come to market with the promise of future revenues being distributed to token holders through some sort of governance vote.  I am of the opinion that the governance aspect of these tokens is relatively valueless and it is those future cashflows to token holders is where something like a COMP, BAL, or UNI comes from.  However, the majority of these defi coins can\u2019t add in revenue \u201cpass throughs\u201d to token holders yet because they don\u2019t make enough money to warrant their valuations. (see revenues and PE ratios here: https://www.tokenterminal.com/)  Any additional fees for token holders in these platforms could theoretically be forked away, and would lead to investors have to value these current low cashflows/revenues rather hope of future cashflows rerating prices lower.  I outline this because UNI doesn\u2019t have this problem, Uniswap makes so much money that if the fee switch is turned on today, valuing those cashflows has UNI at a higher price than it currently is. Hopefully this shows that the fee switch should be turned on, now turning to Burns.  Burns are most common in CEFI tokens so I will look their. Looking at BNB, BNB\u2019s token has seen its highest valuations when the token MAKES people money, not saves people money.  What I mean is this: BNB did very well when you had to use BNB to buy IEO\u2019s when they were pushing every IEO up to 2-5x in a month.  It is also doing well now that you can stake BNB for their \u201cyield farming\u201d product Binance launchpool.  In both cases, BNB is used to make more money for token holders.  When IEO\u2019s slowed down at the end of last year, BNB was only used to save people money on trading fees and their burn and the market priced their token lower.  Now looking at UNI, a burn does not make users money, it instead hopes that the burn will make UNI deflationary.  We know this won\u2019t be the case because of the UNI supply schedule and vesting periods.  By distributing a daily dividend with the fee switch holding UNI makes people money.  This is a subtle difference but one worth highlighting here when discussing whether revenues should go to a dividend vs Burn. I am strongly in camp daily dividend.  This is a jumble of thoughts so feel free to ask questions and I will do more to explain my thoughts. ",

                    "content": "Many have highlighted the problems with the \u201cbuy and burn\u201d approach and I agree completely, burning tokens are a cheap way to artificially boost the short term value of a token without creating new value. That leaves two valid options IMO:  UNI dividends: Converting fees to UNI and distribute it to stakers Non-UNI dividends: Converting fees to a non-UNI crypto (either ETH or an agreed-upon stablecoin) and distribute it to stakers  The two main things we should consider when weighing these options are:  What will be the effect on the price of UNI (i.e.: the short-term, holder value growth dimension) What will be the effect on governance, and by extension, the protocol\u2019s future (i.e.: the long-term, protocol value proposition dimension)  UNI dividends:  Effect on price: This should in theory increase the value of UNI since UNI has to be bought on the open market to be distributed to stakers (I assume no reward would be coming from the community treasury). However, as @Mr_Po noted, if this is done in a predictable/periodic way, it could be gamed and increase volatility. Effect on governance: Distributing UNI dividends to UNI stakers would concentrate power on the largest holders, which I believe would hurt long term governance of the protocol. We must remember that the main goal of having a governance token is to give all stakeholders a voice in the project\u2019s direction. The more distributed the token, the healthier the protocol.  Non-UNI dividends:  Effect on price: This dividend approach would tie the price of UNI to the amount of dividends payed out, in effect providing a floor to the value of UNI. Moreover, since its much harder for someone to manipulate the price of ETH or stablecoins, the buying and distribute scheme could not easily be gamed and would not create additional volatility. Effect on governance: Although distributing non-UNI dividends will not increase decentralization per say, it will definitely not increase centralization. Some might use their dividends to buy more UNI, which itself is fine, but I suspect the majority might use their dividends for other purposes.  In the case where dividends are payed out in a non-UNI token, I have a small preference for payment in stablecoin, as this would make the value of distributions much more stable and predictable (ETH remains somewhat volatile) which is something valuable when considering that the dividends would be passive income. However, I recognize the problem of choosing which stablecoin to use (most of them are centralized and some might even be ponzis), so an ETH dividend might be the best practical choice. I leave out concerns about taxation (if you want to pay less in taxes, then vote for a government that will lower taxes, don\u2019t try to come up with a sketchy distribution scheme that may or may not create taxable events) and network fees as these are superficial concerns that are unrelated to the core discussion about the future of the protocol.

I have to admit this thread has kickstarted a great discussion concerning the cornerstone of the Uniswap platform as a whole and the comparatively related value of its native UNI token. First, I\u00b4d like to segment my 2 cents into parts so everybody can easily navigate my answer. Initially, I would like to add my two cents regarding the value of the token and boom and bust cycles. UNI\u00b4s value has to be by definition inherently tied to the fee structure Uniswap is currently generating otherwise the coin has no value. You could argue that the governance aspect adds enough value to the token, but think about this: Why would you hold a governance token unless you plan to vote? The expected outcome is facing extreme inflation alongside falling demand which would end in a disaster for any of the early adopters of the token. This is, of course, not the best course of action. Regarding the boom and bust cycles mentioned above \u2013 when you are dealing with an innovation of the magnitude we are seeing right now, a boom and bust cycle is an inevitable consequence of human behavior. Our task is to minimize its destructive impact on the project as a whole. If you take a look at any of the innovative companies in the stock market, all of them had a boom and bust cycle; however, only those companies which had a solid foundation survived. Even though the cycle cannot be broken, it can be mitigated. The key to any human action is an incentive. You need to reward early adopters while treating late comers with respect as well. ETH redistribution is not a practical solution due to the fact that the value of the UNI token would suffer as the demand for it would not outweigh the continuous inflation. The UNI holders would have to buy more and more in order to retain their share which could only get us so far because of gas fees. However, if gas fees are fixed, then this could be also another way to distribute alpha. In the current state of affairs, buy and burn token would put a floor under the UNI price and change people\u00b4s incentives. Why would you sell something which you know will go up in value? Therefore, you hold and you do not dump and you eliminate gas fees. The argument that burn would be outpaced by inflation is flawed in multiple aspects. Initially, the burn would outpace the inflation and then there are two scenarios which could happen. If Uniswap continues to grow, the fees would grow; therefore, the burn would be more poweful and would outpace the inflation. However, this applies vice versa as well, if the volumes drop, fees drop, burn is less powerful, inflation stays the same. There is a silver lining to the last outcome though as the price of UNI token would reach a point where the fees collected would be able to buy so much UNI that it would outpace the inflation. That is why burn places a floor under the prices and retains value for everybody unless gas fees are fixed. Cheers. ",

Moreover, after the first four years, inflation will remain stable at 2% per year. If the protocol (i.e.: the fees and by extension the dividends) grow by more than 2% a year, which IMO is probably a low estimate given the growth of DeFi in general, then the intrinsic growth of UNI will outpace inflation. In other words, burning is not the only way to increase value. The new tokens (from inflation) mostly to the community treasury, and if we use that new wealth to grow the protocol, then the value will not be negatively affected. ",

You could wait to claim it until you need it or the gas price is low enough. Those who rush to collect would be penalized by the high gas price. But you\u2019re right that even if a fraction of UNI holders are impatient and collect immediately, then that would paralyze the network (just like when the UNI airdrop happened). One solution could be to have a staking mechanism, where you accumulate dividends only for the time when you stake your UNI (kind of like YFI dividends) and the dividends are transferred to you only when you unstake. This would solve the gas problem and would also incentivize people to hold their UNI longer. This is not perfect however, because if you want to use your dividends to do something else but keep receiving dividends, you would have to unstake and restake (although this could be done atomically with a smart contract). The point is that there are a lot of options when it comes to implementing dividend distribution (the EVM being Turing complete and all) and I\u2019m sure we can find a middle ground that doesn\u2019t involve burning. If you want a good example of why burning might not be a good idea, take a look at CREAM (they burned ~67% of the supply on Sep. 19 and the token now trades even lower than before). ",

The intent is to grow token value by reducing its supply as income grows. Buybacks tend to...      TL;DR: Buybacks get in the way of issuance and the ability to re-invest in the protocol. Excellent way to redistribute value to shareholders, but poor for the protocol long-term. Instead of burning, use an imbalanced Balancer-style liquidity pool, stacked to be bullish on your platform token. eg, weighted 90/10 UNI/ETH. Deposit profits in ETH; this drives the price up just like a burn model. Bonus of making UNI/ETH a more liquid pair without having to issue additional UNI, and of compounding the treasury via the pool fees. Obviously, Uniswap only currently allows for 50/50 pools on its own platform, and it wouldn\u2019t really do to house our treasury on Balancer\u2026 but this looks like the simple and elegant solution we\u2019re looking for.

                    "content": "That is a very interesting solution! On the surface it seems like that could be a viable approach. However, depending on the wider market, it might not guarantee an increase in price in the short term. Let\u2019s look at a toy example:  1 ETH = 400$ 1 UNI = 4$ UNI/ETH 90/10 Uniswap Treasury Pool: 900 UNIs (3600$) and 1 ETH (400$).  Imagine Uniswap accrues 0.1 ETH in fees, which it adds to the treasury pool. Now the pool has 900 UNIs and 1.1 ETH, which, assuming ETH\u2019s value has not changed, would make each UNI worth 4.4$ (to preserve the 90/10 value ratio). Now if this Treasury Pool was the only place where UNI was traded, then indeed the market price of UNI would have risen (since the Treasury Pool would be the only market maker). However, in practice, UNI would still be traded on other exchanges at the old price (i.e.: 4$), which means that there are arbitrage opportunities (e.g.: buying from other exchanges at 4$ and selling through the Treasury Pool at 4.4$) which would bring the price quoted by the Treasury Pool back down to where it was before. So in the short term, people might just arbitrage the Treasury Pool and the token\u2019s value would not necessarily increase. In the long term, on the other hand, if the protocol continuously adds the ETH fees to the Treasury Pool, then the arbitrageurs will end up raising the price on other exchanges to bring it on-par with the price quoted by the Treasury Pool (since arbitrageur would be continuously buying UNI from elsewhere and selling it to the Treasury Pool, raising the price of UNI market-wide)! So yeah I can see how over the long term this approach would gradually raise the price of UNI without the disadvantage of burning. Tbh I have not spent too much time thinking about this so don\u2019t take my analysis as gospel. A more thorough economical analysis would be needed to really understand the side effects of this approach. TL;DR: Long term, it could work. Short term, unsure. ",

If the \u201ctreasury pool\u201d is sufficiently deep, the arbitrage will only move the price up. It sounds like what you\u2019re saying is that the pool won\u2019t have the liquidity fast enough to be the market anchor for price. I don\u2019t think we have to worry about the pool being subject to short term arbitrage, but I could be wrong. There\u2019s a couple things we can do to keep the treasury pool highly liquid until the treasury itself is large enough to achieve parity with other market makers. A.) The existing UNI/ETH pool is pretty liquid already with only fee rewards as an incentive B.)  we can incentivize LPs to the treasury pool in and of themselves with additional UNI, scaling inversely with treasury balance C.) Could also set it up so that the pool needs to capitalize to a certain threshold of the market before going live. This would also incentivize UNI holders to deposit to bootstrap the autonomous buyback machine. Frankly, I hope there are some folks more educated than myself who can chime in on this idea with the type of analysis you\u2019re describing. ",

As you said, it\u2019s more about the liquidity and how deep the Treasury Pool would be vs the rest of the cryptomarket. In the article you originally shared, the author recommends restricting the ability to add/remove liquidity from the Treasury Pool to the protocol/governance (i.e.: regular users would not be able to add/remove liquidity). I don\u2019t know to what extent this is desirable (maybe it prevents users from gaming the system?), and if it is a must-have, how that would work with the reward schemes you describe in B) and C)? I\u2019m being a bit nit-picky here, but that\u2019s because I think this is an interesting idea that deserves thorough discussion. ",

Rationale for different steps:  it holds tokens sells any token to WETH. because it\u2019s public, anyone can go and call the functions so that they don\u2019t have to be called automatically, so anyone has the option of using their own gas. uses stacked WETH to get UNI, essentially pumping UNI/ETH. idea for this is that when V3 launches we can move the bot to work in V3 instead  Why I kinda discourage burning the freshly bought UNI: If in the future gas costs became negligible, we could implement some kind of automatic 0.05% fee payment directly to UNI holders, and the burnt UNI at 0x00\u202600 would claim and burn quite a bit of those fees. So, if they stood in the contract, we could later govern it to distribute it proportionally between UNI holders. ",

Why do you think the largest projects have so many tokens in circulation? Velocity, liquidity. Don\u2019t burn this away and make this token useless. Instead use it as a yield generating instrument. Uniswap is a DAO. The code determines the payout, not a central entity. Put the SEC\u2019s feet to the fire on this one. Make it an actual payout, set precedent, create value. Don\u2019t bend. ",

Also, Berkshire Hathaway in 2018 collected $3.8 billion in dividends\u2026 Buffett loves dividends more than anybody else. But the way he operates his company is unique in that he takes these dividends and buys equity in other companies. This hints at what he\u2019s truly after\u2026 diversification of various companies with dividends. For the record, BRK.B did not witness any shareholder buybacks. So how does this apply to Uniswap? Diversify through the ecosystem. If there\u2019s a way for fees to be generated from the various markets, it should be deposited in a fund based on the diversification line of thinking. This means as smaller cap coins grow, they\u2019ll outperform other tokens. Additionally, as trading volume grows UNI holders will slowly accumulate a larger share of that token. Which somewhat is a self selecting mechanism for the strongest coins. That\u2019s my proposal for what Uniswap should do for the UNI switch\u2026 Pool together the fees earned on the platform in the token the fee is earned from. Then UNI tokens earn a token that represents their share of this pool over time. This way anybody can redeem none, some, or all their share at any given time. Feel free anybody to post a formal proposal using this line of thinking. I don\u2019t know how to go about doing such a thing. (Turns out I can\u2019t post the BRK shares outstanding chart\u2026 not allowed to post media items\u2026 so you\u2019ll need to take my word for it unfortunately.) ",

Place these assets in a pool and distribute a % weight token where users can deposit the token into the contract to withdrawal their share. This allows through diversification of tokens in a model similar to Berkshire Hathaway. Earning fees in this manner means the strongest tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem are earned. And in a way these tokens that rise from small cap, to mid cap, to large cap will outperform the rest of the portfolio\u2026 And UNI holders will benefit as a result. Burns don\u2019t work as it creates a lack of velocity, lack of liquidity\u2026 Earning fees in this manner makes the UNI token a yield generator instrument where the user is actually earning the Ethereum ecosystem in a sense.

(Based on $5 Uni, 400M volume and 100M tokens voting that\u2019s about 6.8)   Similar to point 1, encourages user not to store there Uni on centralised exchanges.
