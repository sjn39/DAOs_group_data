                    "content": "At @SES-Core-Unit we believe that for the crypto industry to truly reach its potential, we must be able to scale up and onboard significantly more developers and technical talent - in a sustainable, repeatable, and systematic way - regardless of crypto market cycles. MakerDAO contributors are at the heart of a healthy ecosystem and an important moat that we seek to actively grow and retain. Our research project X-Ray focuses exactly on that - collecting and analyzing data about developer talent, turning these insights into actions that can help us address both opportunities and bottlenecks. We\u2019re excited to share with you our second major report on the developer journeys into and inside of crypto & Web3 ecosystems. This is a result of an ecosystem-wide effort reaching far beyond the MakerDAO community.** Thanks to this collaboration, we were able to collect responses from 519 developers, representing 140 crypto ecosystems and 20 different industries outside of crypto. For this update, we will focus heavily on the MakerDAO developer profile insights. Our path towards sustainable developer growth  Let\u2019s begin by highlighting some of the findings that our research has surfaced & how we got here: In the previous X-Ray status update, we collected the most useful developer relation strategies & tactics across the funnel from the devrel experts. Through this benchmarking study, we have understood How we can tackle sustainable developer growth using different strategies. Now, Electric Capital\u2019s developer research helped us to frame and understand What the problem/opportunity is for the ecosystem and Maker specifically. We can say with solid evidence that in 2021, many new developers crossed the chasm, and made the jump into crypto/Web3 contribution. Per the 2021 report, some 18K+ developers are now contributing to the space on a consistent basis. Both developer talent and capital are flooding into the crypto/Web3 ecosystem at a rapid pace, indicating growth. However, we see headwinds on the horizon.  Our recommendations for bringing more developers into crypto/Web3 are:  For MakerDAO specifically, developer growth is of particular importance and quite the challenge. Despite the incredible success of the Maker Protocol, the developer growth rate has been low compared to other ecosystems. The fact is, that as one of the most successful protocols in DeFi today, we lag behind in our ability to grow the developer community.  Electric Capital Developer Report 2021 DeFi s.1311920\u00d71080 168 KB   What would MakerDAO be capable of with a large, steadily growing, developer community?  The final piece of the puzzle is to understand Why developers are onboarding into crypto/Web3 in general, and specifically related to MakerDAO. Our research progressed through the crypto/Web3 developer journey survey. Crypto/Web3 developer journey survey findings We have analyzed 519 responses and categorised them into 3 distinct developer profiles:   Crypto Curious developers (outside of crypto but interested to join full-time)  Current Crypto developers (contributing to crypto/Web3)  MakerDAO developers (past or present Maker protocol contributors)  For each of these profiles, we have mapped the developer journey consisting of 3 main stages:   Awareness (insights into crypto discovery, learning, interests, and AHA! moments)  Onboarding (insights into focused learning, top resources, tech & career bottlenecks, and AHA! moments)  Retention (insights into satisfaction, most loved & frustrating, and reasons for churn)  Key Takeaways Across the Journey for MakerDAO developers  MakerDAO developer profile1920\u00d71080 289 KB  Let\u2019s share the key takeaways, especially those relevant for the MakerDAO: Awareness Takeaways Being on the frontier of technology is the primary driver that has pulled developers into Crypto/Web3.  Screenshot 2022-02-08 at 15.53.111759\u00d7747 141 KB  Most current and crypto curious developers have discovered crypto through their social circles or popular social networks like twitter and reddit.  Screenshot 2022-02-09 at 18.26.411495\u00d7645 129 KB  The crypto AHA! moments for prospective crypto devs revolve around the tech\u2019s vision, problems, and builders. For current crypto devs, problems, use cases, and builders ranked the highest. Onboarding Takeaways Once developers are committed to a crypto career, they have clear goals in terms of learning the technology. While the top goals \u201cunderstand what was possible to build with tech,\u201d and \u201cbuild a dapp\u201d are common for all, prospective devs were focused on \u201cgetting a job\u201d while current devs wanted to \u201cunderstand how the tech executed on the values/ethos of crypto.\u201d The values and ethos of the technology are tied very closely with the things that matter the most to its builders. The majority of developers also said they lacked the resources when onboarding into the ecosystem. For current crypto devs, \u201cup-to-date documentation\", \u201chow tech guides\u201d and \"crypto career-specific information\u201d were absent. MakerDAO devs shared that onboarding bottlenecks could be further alleviated by \u201cmaking it easier to find all the documentation and the context, in which it fits\u201d together with \u201cbetter explanations of Maker concepts and hands-on help aimed at newcomers.\u201d However, the team, community, and the breadth of documentation are mentioned as the strengths in MakerDAO\u2019s onboarding process. It is worth bearing in mind that the technical conviction does not mirror career conviction. Many current crypto devs were facing \u201cuncertainty around the longevity of the industry\" (fortunately not as common anymore), \u201clack of technical knowledge,\u201d and \u201ca steep learning curve.\u201d  Screenshot 2022-02-08 at 16.23.461763\u00d7757 192 KB  For MakerDAO devs, there is an additional set of hurdles that they have to overcome. Specifically the \u201cprotocol complexity\u201d, \u201cprevious commitments\u201d, and \u201cfeeling of being intimidated by the skilled team and the community.\u201d  Screenshot 2022-02-08 at 16.26.181749\u00d7733 158 KB  Retention Takeaways We also found that developers in crypto are very satisfied with their careers. The averages for all crypto developers being 8.4. When segmented to developers that work within DeFi the score reduced slightly to 7.9. We were really pleased to see the MakerDAO developer satisfaction average a very high 9.2.  Screenshot 2022-02-08 at 16.40.051748\u00d7715 118 KB  We also asked developers what are the most frustrating aspects of working in the crypto industry. The answers centered around the \u201cuncertainty of regulation\u201d, \u201chype from speculators,\u201d and \u201cnegative crypto narratives in the media.\u201d  Screenshot 2022-02-08 at 16.42.291748\u00d7724 153 KB  Frustrations specific to MakerDAO developer/contributor experience include \"coordination, collaboration & knowledge sharing among core units\u201d and the aspects in which \u201cthe documentation & learning materials could be improved.\u201d  Screenshot 2022-02-08 at 16.46.311754\u00d7510 209 KB  We also looked to understand Why Maker developers stopped contributing to the project. The top reason was \u201cleaving to start their own project\u201d, showcasing the caliber of developers that have worked on the Maker protocol over the years (Maker Mafia ). A smaller number of developers left for reasons that should be evaluated and tracked over time to ensure the health of the developer community at MakerDAO. (We have only scratched the surface here, so please feel free to explore the findings more closely in the long report further linking to 3 distinct developer profiles.) Insight without action is wasted effort just as action without momentum is wasted energy  Screenshot 2022-02-08 at 16.52.181754\u00d7949 136 KB  The insights gathered so far helped us first identify and then refine the strategic opportunities. Having the tactical ways to solve challenges and act on insights identified, we have to get the ball rolling. The SES team is using the X-Ray insights actively to inform its current and future initiatives. For instance, when it comes to developer awareness and the strategic opportunities that we see, the SES initiative of incubating outreach core units (like Marcomms CU) will greatly benefit from the insights that we have gathered. Similarly, when it comes to developer onboarding and the strategic opportunities we see, the SES initiative of incubating Maker Academy core unit is already benefiting from the insights we have gathered. We have published the insights gathered from developer research, shared more about the refined strategic opportunities, along with the SES initiatives that were informed by these insights both on the SES blog and presented them at the status update call. We invite you to explore these resources in your preferred format and pace, and welcome your feedback and questions. You can find our work and contacts at ses.makerdao.network/xray   X-Ray team, @Lenkla @Haiku @teep ** We want to thank our generous ecosystem partners for incentivising the research by providing conference tickets to: Spagett-ETH (3), ETHRio (3), ETHCC (2), and Devcon (1). Big thanks goes to Strategic Happiness CU for providing 10 Maker swag care packages.

                    "content": "Wowzers this research is super informative! Thank you Lenkla. Hopefully Maker Academy can help with some of the obstacles of onboarding new Devs and others alike into MakerDAO.     Lenkla:  Frustrations specific to MakerDAO developer/contributor experience include \"coordination, collaboration & knowledge sharing among core units\u201d and the aspects in which \u201cthe documentation & learning materials could be improved.\u201d   Totally! It feels like this has been an ongoing concern for years now. Personally, I\u2019m Looking forward to the alignment of this DAO\u2014and perhaps the reasons why a United vision has not come into fruition is because:  everyone is working remotely we are scattered across the globe the pandemic does not help with in-person-meetings which can lead to more results, CUs bonding, efficiency, and a united vision. remote mandated actors meetings seem to not result in much alignment (can\u2019t get much done in 1 hour) perhaps remote mandated actors meeting are too crowded add to that the communication to the community via the Forum is too complex/opaque which leads to community members making their own assumptions Delegates + MKR token owners are operating blind folded and have no idea of the vision the mandated actors have agreed upon (if any) or they create their own opinions on a sole vision, as opposed to a united vision, while Core Units push forward a different vision.  Okay, maybe I went too far beyond the intended subject, but hopefully you get my drift.  I really believe one motivating and important factor that is missing is a united vision and getting new Devs and other hires to buy-into that vision. And one way that can be accomplished is by bonding together, in-person and showcasing why we are All passionate about MakerDAO. Getting to know each other is super important. While we All have different views and believes, being together and talking things out will help scale this DAO. I totally believe in the concept of human interaction, with the hope that once we aligned and scale such vision, everything will eventually be Automated. ",

We are working with Maker Academy to ensure the output from these results are harnessed to make their content as impactful as possible. Your point around vision being a key motivating factor for contributors came up repeatedly through our results and is very relevant as we seek to increasingly bring contributors over from \u201ctraditional\u201d spaces into Maker. We completely agree with the points you make and it\u2019s good to see you bring up some specific examples! We believe some of these align directly with a couple of the Strategic Opportunities identified from our research. Specifically: (2) Facilitate connections between new and existing developers, using Web3 as common ground - fostering the creation of a cohesive DAO culture. As well as: (4) Reduce confusion and create contributor clarity through a focal point developer/contributor website - harnessing decentralization while reducing disorganization. While these are developer-focused for the purpose of the work at X-Ray, we also believe that work on these areas will be beneficial for the contributor community at large at MakerDAO. ",
