                    "content": "Unlike other DAOs, Gitcoin Grants did not form from a primordial soup of structurelessness. Gitcoin Grants started as a company. I tweeted a bit about this here.  I also put together this digram to articulate the point.  DAOs can start from structureless primordial soup (like yearn) or they can start from corporate style decision making.  As long as they over time progressively decentralize over time, IMO that captures the intent of the DAO movement.  FSqlEt4VsAEiTpC938\u00d7772 45.5 KB  Why does this matter? Because of Gitcoin\u2019s corporate origins, it has different starting conditions than other DAOs.  a strong work/life seperation (as opposed to more dao/activist cultures) a. hierarchy to unwind. a centralized platform to unwind and decentralize. traditionally, people working at the Holdings company (corporate) have made salaries/benefits - like any corporation. there are probably many other different starting conditions that I am not aware of.  Comment below if there are other things you want to name.  I wrote this post because I wanted to name this, becasue I think its gone unspoken in a lot of different conversations about DAO life / what a DAO is. ",
