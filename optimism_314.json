Not easy, but I think it can be done by asking them about their needs and concerns and offering places where they can participate in finding new solutions to be implemented in the ecosystem. Many people come around and use the platform, but know nothing about OP collective values and governance experimentation. Why don\u2019t make an incentive for them to fill in some questionary, asking them about their thoughts and collecting data so we can offer them some space for them to participate? To sum up: There is so much human value out there that is needed. We need to go beyond the digital divide, language barrier, functional diversity, etc. This industry is pretty biased and this would be a good place to break that. Congrats on all the hard job, I found many people here caring about OP values and sure there are more people like you out there on their way for the near future. I wish yoy the best for the end of the season. ",

BUT all in all, community that are actually interacting with proposals on the forum are at most 30. Proposals: f) Requiring TWO delegates with 0.5% voting power put a stop to many proposals because related to the point e), as a proposers you need to wrangle delegates to go for your proposal and engage with it AND there are only 36 delegates with 0.5% vp. g) Pacing for proposals feels very hectic at times because of the small (and needed) changes to the OPerating Manual.

                    "content": "Thank you for starting this thread!  Below I have shared a few points of feedback that are top of mind.  One of the things I have enjoyed the most about OP governance is the openness to feedback and iteration.  I feel the foundation has done a fantastic job of consistently making improvements based on feedback from the community.  Below are some of my thoughts on this season, happy to clarify any points or answer any questions.  Accountability For Grant Recipients The biggest point that needs to be addressed (which I think we all agree) is accountability for grant recipients.  The presentation on the performance of the governance fund was a sobering wake up call that is critical to have an accountability component for projects that have received grants.  Possible solutions could include putting a cap on grant amounts and not granting all of the funds up front.  We could require a monthly reporting function in order to unlock additional funds.  There are many ways this could be implemented and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing ideas and new processes in the next season.  Committees Committees seemed like a really great way to decrease delegate workload.  However, I don\u2019t believe they have worked well or as intended in practice.  Essentially, when a vote does not pass, people are upset and have a group to point their negative feelings towards.  I have personally not enjoyed being on a committee.  Our committee has many years of experience in the space, from many different backgrounds, and we have faced quite a bit of criticism regarding our recommendations when they are meant to be helpful, and delegates are free to vote as they wish.  I have personally voted against other committee recommendations and we have seen votes go against committee recommendations.  I\u2019ve found that committees have not decreased my workload and being on a committee has been an unpleasant experience (although I have loved working with my team!!!).  Committees are not something I believe should be carried into the next season.  Overall Engagement and Vibe Delegate engagement seems fairly low overall.  It\u2019s been pointed out that it\u2019s difficult to get delegate approval for proposals.  It seems like there are only 10-15 delegates that are consistently active on the forum and discord.  A possible solution for this could be delegate compensation (see below) to incentive delegates to engage on a more consistent basis. There has been an increase in negative comments and personal attacks recently in the forums and discord.  This is an unfortunate reality of the space overall.  I believe there should be a zero tolerance policy when it comes to personal attacks.  Possible solutions could include having a moderator/community lead role to enforce community guidelines.  Ultimately, it is up to us as the OP community to define what is acceptable and what is not.  Having a culture that is respectful and welcoming is essential to growth and development, and that starts with how we treat each other.  Delegate Compensation There is currently a fairly hefty workload on delegates that includes reading proposals, providing feedback, voting and providing reasoning, providing approval for proposals, and general community communication and engagement, just to name a few.  What we have at the moment is essentially a group of volunteers that are not being compensated for their time, which is probably part of the reason why delegate engagement is low.  I would like to see delegate compensation with a retroactive component in the next season. ",

                    "content": "I have been away camping for a bit (hence the ETH pump I guess\u2026) and have been thinking about our governance system while offline, I came back with lots of points to raise but to be honest you\u2019ve laid out almost exactly what I wanted to say. Since introducing committees we\u2019ve seen much less engagement, with less names on Discord and here, as well as a complete change in the vibes, with a huge amount of negativity and at times what seems like targeted harassment, with certain members of the losing committee using their large Twitter accounts to poison opinion of members they disagree with. I would assume that this contributes to the reduction in engagement from other community members who simply do not want to be involved in the drama that is so different from the first season. The compensation going only to committee members is, as again you have stated, probably a factor in reduced engagement as well. Perhaps rather than dividing the community into committee members and non-members a simpler way to manage compensation would be via something like Coordinape, so anyone who had something of value to add to evaluations could be rewarded for it, this would incentivize useful discussion in proposal threads and mean that delegates who don\u2019t want to put the time into reviewing certain proposals themselves could just read the discussion here and be fairly safe in assuming that the rest of the community would have dug into it and pulled out valuable considerations, because they would be retroactively rewarded for doing so. The only two issues I see here would be whether everyone receiving any reward via Coordinape would need to be KYC\u2019d, and how to avoid sockpuppets and Sybils. I guess that in that case the former would kind of solve for the latter! Regarding accountability I agree that segmented payouts, linked to KPIs in some way would make sense. Projects could include these KPIs in the proposals and delegates can evaluate these as part of their assessments. This would leave it up to the proposers to find the balance between impressive sounding KPI targets, with the risk of not meeting them, or to make more modest expectations on future performance which could mean their proposal is less enticing in the first place. TL:DR; basically exactly what you said, but a little less eloquently! ",

From my view once we introduce hierarchical status/power we can only expect people to fight for it (if they want to get to that level). It\u2019s the human nature\u2026 voting power is already controversial enough, we shouldn\u2019t need another hierarchy on top of that. That said, removing the status and power I don\u2019t see as many issues with \u201cWorking Groups\u201d or Community Members paid to put time and effort in the governance process. If we have enough individuals helping proposers and giving some analysis of the proposal (let\u2019s say pros and cons, it doesn\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t be yes/no) they deserve some compensation for that work, I\u2019m fine with that as far as people don\u2019t need to \u201cfight for it\u201d.     MinimalGravitas:  The compensation going only to committee members is, as again you have stated, probably a factor in reduced engagement as well.   Paying individuals/groups to do something means everyone else will not care/worry as much about it, someone will do the work (aka \u201cthey get paid for that\u201d).

I hope we can learn from their shortcomings during the upcoming reflection period (and potentially longer), with the goal of reintroducing a more effective Committee system in the future. At Devcon, I was able to speak with delegates and some Committee members, and many were quick to express their dissatisfaction with the current process. Most complaints were about the review periods being too short, conflicts of interest arising between some committee members and grant applicants, and the pressure that is put on Committee members, all of whom are part-time and unpaid. Presently, the primary responsibility of the Collective is to decide where to allocate OP which brings a large burden on part-time Committee members who essentially became gatekeepers of a multi-million dollar treasury overnight. With few exceptions (maybe only Overtime?), Committee recommendations were in line with the winning side of votes. They have a major impact on the entire proposal process but we can clearly see them pressed for time, often submitting proposal approvals and recommendations only hours or minutes before they are due. We should seriously consider extending the Voting Cycles.  Grants My biggest concern was one raised on the most recent Governance call: 20% of the entire Governance Fund was used in the first 140 days of the Collective\u2019s existence. And while Optimism has grown across every metric during that period and incentives certainly helped, a large number of OP grants were misused or even outright misappropriated. The Collective needs to put together an urgent response and start running a tighter ship with the treasury. The reality is that sustainable apps/projects can succeed on Optimism without incentives, and the Collective should generally grant smaller and smaller amounts to fewer and fewer projects as time progresses. On this week\u2019s call, a rep from @GFXlabs put it bluntly when they said we \u201care not currently being good stewards\u201d of the treasury, and I have to agree with them. There are dozens of examples of blockchains/dapps that wasted large treasuries on a few months of incentives. Optimism is incredibly important for the future of Ethereum and we cannot allow governance to follow a short-sighted path.  Vibe I think the personal attacks and overall animosity that arose in this forum and Discord over the last few months are unacceptable. Thankfully it seems the majority of delegates rose above the nonsense. This may come across as harsh but it\u2019s all out of love, I may be a smol delegate but have been in this community for a while and am concerned with the direction things are heading. I remain a capital \u201cO\u201d Optimist and continue to build on Optimism every day. ",

I have been providing some feedback as part of the community, but not expecting any airdrop, just because I like this. That\u2019s called intrinsic motivation and is stronger than any other. I posted a proposal a week ago and no feedback at all. Is not the only one:    [Draft] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] DAOhaus Governance Fund: Phase 1       Project Name: DAOhaus  Author Name: Sam Baurle and Spencer Graham, DAOhaus  I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes  L2 Recipient Address:    eco.daohaus.eth  Grant category: Governance Fund Phase 1  Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee?  This proposal falls under the Infrastructure and Tooling Committee that at the time of writing the latest version of this proposal has already been elected.  \u2026     I don\u2019t see how this scenario is going to invite new people to participate.     katie:  Delegate engagement seems fairly low overall. It\u2019s been pointed out that it\u2019s difficult to get delegate approval for proposals. It seems like there are only 10-15 delegates that are consistently active on the forum and discord. A possible solution for this could be delegate compensation (see below) to incentive delegates to engage on a more consistent basis.   Sure, I can tell some delegates care about the work they\u2019re doing and deserve it. But much more delegates are needed and community members working with them. The committee\u2019s solution was more centralization and as far as I understand delegates are committee members, so much work for them. I think we need to facilitate the participation of new users.

                    "content": "Hey, SR from Gamma. I stuck around for Season 2 to monitor OP governance and learn about your experimental process. It\u2019s part of a larger scheme I\u2019m doing to research for our future governance model someday. I must commend everyone on their passion and dedication to Optimism. I will say that I have one major conclusion from Season 2: The Committee system, while well-intentioned, has been a huge net negative. I will explain my observations briefly below. 1) Committees make the application process confusing for all  I don\u2019t think I need to offer much-supporting evidence here. Almost every project has been confused by the committee system. The deadlines, allocations, and pretty much everything has been unclear. While I respect the idea that \u201cwe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d I  think it\u2019s far too confusing for the average applicant. Many of these projects are simultaneously doing a dozen other governance proposals, and forcing them through a complex committee process isn\u2019t efficient. 2) Committees warp the free-market power structure of delegation One of the cool things about DAOs to me is the free-market aspect of delegation. If I, SR, wanted to become a delegate, I would need to either acquire OP, or convince people to delegate OP to me. If a delegate wishes to have more governance power, they can use any number of strategies to work on that. The best delegates will be the most competitive for the delegated OP.  We have delegates that are private holders, DAO enthusiasts, project leads, VCs, and more. That\u2019s kinda how it should be IMO. Unfortunately, committees create bureaucrats. Or, in layman\u2019s terms, they create gatekeepers with a disproportionate amount of power than they should have. These committee members become lightning rods for controversy and gatekeeping. 3) Committees have brought out the worst in people Issues #1 and #2 both invariably lead to issue #3, that the committee system has brought out accusations, corruption, innuendo, favoritism, Machiavellianism, brinkmanship, factions, and pretty much everything that poisons the governance process. This process started during the heated election between the defi committees and never stopped.  unknown2413\u00d7765 149 KB  It never recovered after that. Twitter posts attacked the other committee\u2019s recommendations based on thoroughness.  image984\u00d7920 124 KB  Users went to other discords to denigrate or discredit other delegates, despite their claims  image1246\u00d7100 13.7 KB   image1792\u00d71046 174 KB  People requested threads be brigaded  image2269\u00d71018 239 KB  Requests were made to censor or ban users from the discord and governance forums.   image955\u00d7694 87.3 KB  It also just became childish with amateur attempts to humiliate delegates  unknown_4861\u00d7449 82.7 KB  Hey, you\u2019re picking on Velodrome! I know I\u2019m picking on Velodrome and their attacks on @OPUser, but honestly, their actions (and specific reactions to me calling it out) demonstrated the committee system failure the best. That\u2019s what I was trying to show the whole time. @OPUser rejected my original proposal rather harshly. I have no vested interest in any committee member. I think Velodrome members are just doing what they think they need to do in a hypercompetitive space. They\u2019re very pvp and they embrace that. Do I think it\u2019s ethical? No. But I get what they\u2019re doing.  image741\u00d7785 104 KB  My recommendation is to abolish the committee system ASAP. Potential Solution: Recognized Delegates Recognized Delegates (RDs) are a system where any delegate can go through the \u201cofficial process\u201d and become legit. RDs are required to vote and to write WHY they voted on proposals. They are then paid based on their participation rates and the # of delegates they have. This incentivizes delegates to write up their feelings on issues and spend some time going through the proposals. Delegates can also get bonuses for assisting users\u2019 questions. This is the system MakerDAO uses, and while not perfect, the RD system itself works pretty well. I think it\u2019s an excellent alternative to the committee system. Every delegate has a shot to get paid for doing the work. Thanks btw, everyone. It\u2019s been a very fascinating experiment, and I thank everyone (even the velo guys) for the political intrigue. ",

                    "content": "    katie:  The presentation on the performance of the governance fund was a sobering wake up call that is critical to have an accountability component for projects that have received grants.       forrest:  My biggest concern was one raised on the most recent Governance call: 20% of the entire Governance Fund was used in the first 140 days of the Collective\u2019s existence. And while Optimism has grown across every metric during that period and incentives certainly helped, a large number of OP grants were misused or even outright misappropriated.   I\u2019m glad that @katie and @forrest are teeing up a major unaddressed elephant in the room - the poor outcomes of the distribution process to date. A lot of the structural concerns in my view are related to this core symptom. I\u2019ve been writing a much longer piece of research on this point [edit: nvm this got really long], but I do want to say that I\u2019m largely in line with their conclusions, which include more selectivity on grants, more time to deliberate, more reporting, staging, and general accountability, etc. Some sort of budgeting (which should start to seek inflows of capacity, to the extent it\u2019s possible) is more than appropriate as well. I do want to note \u2013 because I think some of these postmortems are obliquely referring to a large grant proposal currently on the table, Velodrome\u2019s (i.e., my protocol\u2019s)\u2014that the wrong thing to do is to have a knee-jerk response to large grants (assuming they\u2019re well-scoped) and say, \u201cWell, we need to close the purse.\u201d Doing that just kills whatever momentum you\u2019ve just spent too much to get. You can say I\u2019m speaking out of bias, but hear me out here\u2014I\u2019m trying to make what I think is an important point that I happen to be really attuned to bc of my experience. Where I disagree with @forrest is that it\u2019s not that Governance has given out too much\u2014it\u2019s that we\u2019ve given an enormous amount to a lot of not-fully-baked grants while lacking an ecosystem-wide thesis on what to grow and when to grow it. If I had to make a totally non-data-backed guess, my hypothesis is that proposals representing 70-80% of the OP shouldn\u2019t have been granted at all, not just scaled back. (I\u2019ll be testing this hypothesis soon with a more detailed analysis.) Reporting would have helped with some of this, but primarily it\u2019s for averting or surfacing malfeasance. Staging helps to redirect some OP to more promising ends and lends some teeth to enforcement, but the vast majority, i\u2019m guessing, just never should have been granted in the first place. It\u2019s actually a bit surprising to me that nobody here has explicitly said, \u201cMaybe in hindsight, many of these grants we approved actually weren\u2019t that well defined.\u201d Delegates who were more prominent figures during the first few cycles should take a hard look at their earlier recommendations and walk back through the logic in approving what they did. I know I\u2019ll plan to do the same for the later cycles. There are already a couple I think I botched. This is underappreciated reflection for this period. I\u2019m giving this tough love because the saddest part about this mass distribution\u2019s outcomes (and, to be clear, the vast majority came before committees) was that they were entirely avoidable. People who\u2019ve been around for a while, for instance, know how some of these things end: retroactive airdrops (exit events), user incentives (sibyl risk, low per-wallet appeal), liquidity mining on low-DAU projects (siphoning by team or last-ditch effort to grow runway)\u2014stuff I\u2019ve been calling out from my very first day in the forums, and I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t alone. What I\u2019m getting at is that there is no \u2018right\u2019 cap on all grants: you need to match the asks to an intended outcome\u2014a well-defined bet that you and the proposer intend to see play out. You can and should add jet fuel with some big bets, just like OP Labs did to great effect with PoolTogether (beloved user hoover), Velodrome (flashy tentpole liquidity sink), and AAVE (blue-chip liquidity magnifier). But you don\u2019t take a scattershot approach in grants, giving out a few hundred k here and there; you work with projects to refine their grants until they promise real results. And when you see a path to growth, you fund for precisely that growth. And this goes back to my first comments re committees, during the start of what several individuals here have marked as a downturn in vibes: there need to be in some capacity specialists whose focus is specifically on these grants. There is just too much to do. These are difficult questions, and there\u2019s a lot to follow up on. These specialists need to outline a systemic growth thesis, they need to follow an actual cooperative due diligence process, and they need some limited executive power to make and enforce rules to speed up an otherwise bogged down process. One such example is reporting; there was a whole thread in June discussing the need for follow-up reporting, and nobody managed to get a framework together. People reacted violently to my suggesting as much in June because perhaps they interpreted what I was saying as that people without the necessary expertise to take on these roles lacked the aptitude or intelligence or something. Of course that\u2019s not true! What I\u2019ve said is that being charged with giving out millions of OP requires some clear direction, experience, and knowhow; it\u2019s inherently a technocratic thing, and I do think that ecosystem protocol teams have a lot to offer in experience, perspective, and news. Even better, though, are known subject matter experts from throughout crypto, and I\u2019d love to see about getting a few more involved (we\u2019re lucky to have several as delegates and more than a few on committees). To be clear, I\u2019m not talking about committees now, nor am I saying I or anyone in particular fits this profile! No idea what structure we will/should take, and yeah I agree that the system we have isn\u2019t the best fit (agree with @StrategicReserve\u2019s suggestion to look to RDs and look forward to getting thoughts from @katie and @GFXlabs on applicability) \u2014 but I think this is a principle worth seriously considering. We\u2019re all here because we believe in the potential of the Collective to be a self-sustaining community, one that can recycle this first round of grants and ensuing economic activity into new capacity to do ever more interesting things. Realizing this vision is a lot more likely when we knock out some low-hanging fruit early in our processes, avoid pressure to over-distribute, and\u2014most importantly\u2014be informed and active.

                    "content": "    katie:  What we have at the moment is essentially a group of volunteers that are not being compensated for their time, which is probably part of the reason why delegate engagement is low. I would like to see delegate compensation with a retroactive component in the next season.   Want to echo this. Nowhere else in the world (or even DeFi) are millions of dollars handed out on the backs of volunteer labor. There is a saying out in the regulatory landscape when people have had a drink and want to dunk on DeFi \u2013 that DAOs are the greatest breakthrough in labor relations since the cat-o-nine-tails. That\u2019s not what we want here. The goal is inclusion, yes, but not uncompensated responsibilities that are difficult to bear for delegates who don\u2019t receive compensation outside of Optimism, yet carry possible liability and reputational risk from being tasked with saying \u201cNo\u201d to unwise spending proposals. Delegates have put in a great effort, but when this role competes with families, jobs, hobbies, and life in general, it\u2019s difficult to expect better results than were presented in the sobering call this week. That the single grant to Aave has surpassed ALL grants from this governance in effectiveness by orders of magnitude says a lot. The modest and very specific justification for proposals that typically fall before the Tooling Committee vs most others (with meme requests like 420k) also serves as an anecdotal alarm that things are not well in the grant program. Given the large sums at risk, professionalization seems imperative \u2013 and that only comes with compensation. Even just reducing the amount of waste would more than pay for a couple dozen delegates to put in 8-10 hours a week. Paying for 3-4 days a month of delegate time seems prudent here. We are confident, however, that Optimism can overcome these challenges. We don\u2019t necessarily agree that committees should be disbanded, but perhaps exploring other power structures could be useful. Perhaps the committees decide what comes up for a vote. Or perhaps they only have veto power to block a proposal. Or perhaps they continue in merely an advisory role. Or perhaps they have an optimistic role where their recommendations stand unless X votes choose to send the choice to a full vote as we do today. There are many options beyond disbandment \u2013 committees have been a net positive for governance, even if serving on one is onerous and unpleasant. Rather than jump to a conclusion or prescription now, perhaps this upcoming Reflection Period would be a good time to understand which delegates are active, get in-depth feedback beyond a forum reply, and make some changes. Many of us (at least on DeFi Committee A) are professional governance service providers. These are not new problems. Some have defied solutions on other protocols (so let\u2019s avoid those same attempts here) while others have yielded to trial and error (so let\u2019s learn from that here). Please utilize the experiences that seasoned individuals and entities bring to the table. Coupled with the energy of Optimism-native enthusiasts, governance iteration can be faster, fairer, and more productive. ",

                    "content": " Proposal Recommendation   I totally understand frustration from a project side on getting No as a recommendation but wrapping a proposal recommendation as a possible attack on the Protocol and using that to down play other committee is not sustainable. This might push some community member away. When reviewing a proposal I am looking at the template provided to us by OP Foundation, it has different statement; when a protocol is unique I do give it few extra points but overall what is mentioned in the proposal has more value, for me its an non-binding agreement. I am not suggesting your protocol is not good or it does not have value, my suggestion is to improve few things, I am asking for additional information, this gonna only make proposal better, making a small change could make the overall process better. But there two instances where a \u201cNo\u201d recommendation blew out of proportion.    I would like to echo concern related to overall lack of engagement as others have mentioned above.   Fund accountability and lack of communication from prior grant receiver Apart from Uni, Rubicon, Pooltogether no one is sharing any detail related to use of fund and its impact on the ecosystem. I dont expect OP Foundation to poke every protocol but may be from community side we can put some pressure on them, we have many delegate with huge online presence. All we need is little push. To my surprise when I contacted Slingshot for details on Phase 0 fund usage they were kind enough to provide a detailed report (Its not dune but its something)while Stargate didnt even responded to direct DM or twit. We did approve those fund, this is the least we could do.   Fund accountability   I dont believe we are spending too much or too fast, I think we are doing the distribution in dark without proper data. Phase 0 was inauguration ceremony, we did bulk approval. At that, There were 7 proposal I would have voted against and now when I look back and read those proposal, this number has moved to 13 (which also show that we have made progress in auditing proposal). So, using old metric to evaluate a proposal might hurt us in long run.   I would like to iterate again, and last community call should be wake up call for all of us, we need data on overall fund use. Here, I dont trust any project as they could possibly inflate the number, I am advocating that this report should either come from Foundation or from an independent third party.   Usually protocol as responsive to feedback and willing to adjust the token requested but one think I am reading frequently is that \u201cwe believe X amount of $OP is justifiable because a similar project in Phase 0 was approved\u201d or in other word, when foundation can approve a similar grant why you are asking to reduce it. ? I can answer to this question if we have data.   Looking at upcoming go-live date of other L2s, we need to be more competitive and this could help us that.   What we are hearing now is the echo of our bulk approvals,I wouldn\u2019t call it a mistake, but I am afraid, it will be if we go one more season without accountability of fund.  (Here I am talking about both grant, Gov + Foundation)  Lack of context    This is quite important, at least to me, protocols are comparing their proposal from past proposal, like mentioned above, without knowing the context.   We are doing all this in an iteration, rushing to make chance mid-cycle makes no sense at all. New community members are not aware of this and we should help them understand the process but in this season I saw that existing community member were rushing to make changes mid-cycle.   Some delegates are engaged with other task and does not have enough bandwidth to read everything, that was one reason to form the committee, and if you spam the complete channel on daily basis then either it will create an illusion that what you are advocating for is a common opinion hence creating a echo-chamber and delegates will end of making an un-informed decision.    Community Management   We need some rules related to community management, there should be a process to ban/deactivate someone\u2019s account for a time period( on some criteria). Community code of conduct is needed. I would like to see a process to relieve a delegate from its duties, my suggestion would be to this when Citizen house is active as i would like to see them involved when someone invoke delegate removal process.  Those are my personal opinion, as a committee we will also share a committee feedback summary. ",

You have your \u201cstory\u201d. You fill out a questionnaire about your background and skills. On maker, they actually make you deploy a contract too. Once you\u2019re an RD. You are judged by three factors:  participation percentage response percentage OP you hold  These get put into the algo (it\u2019s progressive, so whales get paid less per OP) and you are paid for your contributions. If you miss a vote, your participation percentage goes down. If you miss a response, your response percentage goes down. If people undelegate, your voting weight goes down. All these things will determine how much you are paid. RDs avoid gaming the system by internal policing. Responses are not screened for being fair or balanced etc, they are simply screened for being cohesive and understandable, If someone is just copy pasting a canned response, that can be evaluated by the OP labs foundation. It would be wise for OPLabs foundation to create a sort of \u201cOmbudsman\u201d type role, that validated users\u2019 responses as adequate and kept the delegates in check to their status. There has been some concern expressed by delegate that they don\u2019t have the time/bandwith/allocations to do this work. But I would strongly discourage tolerating that behavior. In a delegate free market, if you don\u2019t vote and participate, you should generally lose delegation, and you certainly shouldn\u2019t be paid. Paying RDs gives smaller delegates a chance to snatch OP from bigger ones by being more thorough. ",

Committee members gets blamed for everything. Slow responses, proposal rejections, not enough feedback, not being online enough etc. Taking the compensation further, I don\u2019t think committees and delegate should be much different. Delegates should also be compensated as they are doing a lot of work too. Reading a commitee\u2019s recommendation and agreeing or not, while comparing to the original proposal is not trivial. Now multiply that by 20 proposals and you got a full time job. I personally found commitees helpful. Annoying to be in one, but for the proposals that were not for the tooling committee I almost always went with the recommendation. And it felt good.  ",

There is a missing peace that we need to find through experimentation.     polynya:  Regarding delegate compensation: we have extremely low participation from token holders too.   Firstly, I have read some of your post and it\u2019s great to see a few people on OP caring about the values and expressing their points of view with honesty and humbleness. I\u2019m glad you point out the low token holders participation. This is a critical point for me. I believe we need to spread the word about the importance of the OP collective governance experiment. This is not only DeFi (that\u2019s why I keep talking about the bias)  this is about an oportunity to change the world in a lot of ways. I\u2019ve been spreading the work on some Spanish forums and I brought a few people to the protocol by sending them some ETH to claim the NFT, and I helped a friend to claim his airdrop and delegate before the snatpshot. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ll keep trying to find a way for community engagement. This is the personal relationship approach I believe in, but is so much time-consuming and hard to compete with mass media marketing and trends.

                    "content": "    StrategicReserve:  One of the cool things about DAOs to me is the free-market aspect of delegation.   From a free-market perspective, DAOs and OP Token House should follow free-for-all mechanisms. I deeply believe decision making should be achieved by consensus and not because people put trust in few members/delegates. We all know achieving consensus is hard but it\u2019s how DAOs make any sense at all. We don\u2019t need DAOs to replace hierarchical organizations. That said, I\u2019m happy if we end the committees experiment in this season and we reward/incentive participation using objective and subjective metrics. Starting from\u2026     StrategicReserve:  Recognized Delegates (RDs) are a system where any delegate can go through the \u201cofficial process\u201d and become legit. RDs are required to vote and to write WHY they voted on proposals. They are then paid based on their participation rates       StrategicReserve:  Every delegate has a shot to get paid for doing the work.       katie:  I think the only missing piece would be to apply performance metrics for compensation that could include voting frequency, communication and amount delegated.   This is what I would like to see in the future (next season)\u2026  Free-for-All Governance Paradigm  No hierarchical power, delegates and non-delegates have the same status, power and voice. Proposals should incorporate a \u201ctemperature check\u201d poll to move to the next phase (voting phase or something else before that). Token House Members will receive \u201cPoints\u201d for every measurable action (objective metrics). Points are converted at the end of each season into a payment and/or NFT (using a subjective ratio voted at the end of the season). This payment can be claimed (following previous rules, KYC for money/OP, \u2026) or reverted to the DAO if not claimed.   Governance Phases I guess this season revealed the less layers we have in the Governance Process better it is for everyone. We can keep Voting phases on a regular base but we need to simplify this process. Using \u201ctemperature checks\u201d and a fixed N amount of votes (25, 50, 100 I don\u2019t really know but it can\u2019t be a low number) to move proposals to the last phase (voting) can work. Even if the proposal doesn\u2019t look ready (ideally only members with \u201csome activity\u201d should be able to vote to avoid fake accounts), even if there\u2019s not enough iteration/feedback, at the end voters will make their choice. If there\u2019s enough feedback and even some analysis of pros and cons (whatever) better it is for the proposal. In the free-for-all logic, members willing to help the governance process should create their own analysis/review post on Proposals they want to focus. Considering engagement of that post they will receive points (that will be converted in some sort of payment at end of season). There\u2019s some competition aspect in this, if N members (delegates or not) create their own analysis of the same proposal the ones with more likes will receive more points. Difference in this competition is people isn\u2019t competing against each other but competing to make their reviews more useful to everyone in the Governance. Btw, this also requires a new forum structure with sub-categories for every cycle to make everything cleaner.  Objective Metrics I like to use hybrid versions of this objective metrics, for instance instead of 1 reply/comment = 1 point, I like to think replies without a single like aren\u2019t useful at all (meaning they will get zero points). I will just share some metrics as example and we can go from there (if people like the concept).   Proposal comments/replies: Every 5 likes gives 1 point => likes / 5  1 comment with 5 likes = 1 point; 2 Likes + 2 Likes + 1 like in different comments = 0.4 + 0.4 + 0.2 = 1 point; btw, 5 can be replaced with any value. I think 5 is fine since we don\u2019t have much engagement but we can even change this value for each season.    Review Posts/Topics: Using all likes on the post and comments seems fair, avoiding using the same exact ratio let\u2019s say 7 likes = 1 point => (likes on comments and post) / 7  Post creator (proposal reviewer) will receive points not based on the amount of replies (to avoid spam) but instead based on the quality measurable by users feedback (likes). Sure this can be gamed but that\u2019s why we still need some subjective metrics at the end to filter/remove/ignore \u201cattacks\u201d.   I don\u2019t follow discord at all but similar rules can be applied and tracked on discord. Also, since I don\u2019t have a clue if people will like to follow something like this I will stop here (for now). Nonetheless there\u2019s plenty of metrics we can use to give points to DAO members.   Subjective Metrics This reply is longer than what I would like so I will end with this note: Subjective metrics should allow us the fight spam, unfairness in some objective metrics and more.  Small Update \u2192 This subjective metrics can range from ratios to convert points into OP/Whatever to something like ignoring/voiding points from some posters (fake accounts), topics, whatever. From my perspective, subjectivity is always needed to prevent abuse/attacks (it\u2019s not to replace objective metrics but instead to improve their effectiveness). ",

That said, we now should focus on solutions. I did my best to present an alternative but I will not push this free-for-all concept (eventually the RD solution isn\u2019t that bad but I would like to see delegates and non delegates at the same level, otherwise I don\u2019t expect much engagement from non delegates).

I\u2019m a small wallet holder, first timer and came to optimism trough my own defi journey touching almost all chains where gas fee\u2019s were on a level i could afford them (non mainnet\u2026) . I\u2019m not on optimism from an idealogical perspective of governance, I don\u2019t know all the history, and i am because i think longer term i can optimize my returns here. And i\u2019m locked in longer term because i locked my funds in Velo due to the OP drop on 10K lock combined with good return on bribes. From there i explored Syntehtics stack, Quix, Sonne, OpenX, etc. So now i\u2019m in I thought lets try & comment As a smaller wallet holder, i think;   Its pretty complex to participate to governance & also a bit intimidating. there\u2019s a lot of material to read and conflicting opinions + discussions on different topics are in same channels in discord + all those seemingly smart people. For me simple things would help like a channel per proposal so i can read up on just the proposals i have interest in / the ones i feel i have a bit more knowledge about. Discord is for me the easiest way of comms   You\u2019re spending millions & basically running an investment fund, my rl job is with a company and when i spend those amounts i need to report weekly on the progress of returns. you can demand 1-5% of a grant must be used for reporting of results. You can demand more sophiticated grant requests where funds are realased in batches based on KPI achievements   I can imagine delegates need compensation, this increases quality. In my view, this compensation should come from a balance between their portolio performance (eg Defi, NFT, etc.) & OP token performance. I think this creates accountability & quality + delegates need to have skin in the game in my view  (my assumption is each delegate also holds significant amounts of OP?). What i do find extra complex, in my normal job i sign for the fact i do not work / share info with competitors; this line is more blurred in defi I understand but i feel uncomfortable with delegates who also hold large bags/interest on other, especially competing, chains   I think it makes sense to do a periodical reset of delegations; like once per year delegations are reset and need to be re-committed; this requires activite desicion making. Nearly every political entity re-elects its leaders periodically and votes are not carried over in this process   I would love to see a strategy behind grant allocation (+ this strategy made transparant) and voting on metrics related to that strategy. eg if strategy is to aquire non-mercenary capital, incentivize long term lock in of strategic assets (eg long term btc lock ins) etc. With a transparant strategy, it becomes easier for anyone to evaluate the pro\u2019s/con\u2019s of a grant and thereby contribute to governance   Those are my top of mind thoughts. hope it helps. In the end, i just hope for quality so i know the funds I committed for longer term are going to grow. best ",

As we collect more and more data about performance of past proposals we find what does and does not work. An example of this is retroactive airdrops do not seem to be the best use of $OP from this fund based on the data. In order to avoid inefficient use of $OP funding in these early stages I suggest we begin to increase the snapshot vote approval threshold based on the amount of $OP requested. Like so:  Less than x,xxx,xxx $OP | Approval Threshold  = 51% Greater than x,xxx,xxx $OP | Approval Threshold  = xx% Greater than x,xxx,xxx $OP | Approval Threshold  = xx%  And I order to reduce risk and facilitate accountability I suggest we tranche $OP distribution for approved proposals and ensure each distribution tranche is gated by a milestone that is explicitly stated in the proposal. The above are of course just ideas meant for feedback and ideation so please thoughts and feedback encouraged. Committee Leanings: I actually really enjoyed being a part of a committee as the NFT and Gaming Committee had a relatively light workload (I totally understand this was the exact opposite case for everyone else) The relatively light workload really allowed our committee as a team to heavily engage with the proposal submitters which facilitated some really great ideation on the proposal which I think will ultimately result in these proposals having a higher likelihood of success. If we do ultimately decide to disband committees which I am fine with I still think it is incredibly valuable  for projects to feel as if they have an entity/group they feel represented by and can go to for guidance as for many projects I know governance can sometimes be unapproachable.

                    "content": "Hi everyone, Ross here from a16z. This is a great thread that thoughtfully highlights a number of areas for improvement moving forward. We\u2019ve noticed that delegate and delegator (token holder) engagement is a recurring theme across both this thread and others. Most other protocols have also faced token holder and delegate apathy, implementing a variety of mechanisms and UX designs in an attempt to solve these issues. Voter apathy is a governance problem that crypto may be uniquely suited to address. We offer two primary areas through which to improve voter engagement via delegation. When both areas are addressed, they can have a compounding effect on increasing delegation rates. 1. User Interface The average user should be able to delegate to an active delegate via the simplest workflow possible to encourage delegation. A separate proposal to fund a professional UX design analysis may be appropriate to address this design problem with data-based rigor. 2. Incentivization As others in this thread have addressed, economic incentivization is a powerful tool to encourage user engagement. Many forms of incentivization and funding sources have already been listed in this thread. We will merely add to those suggestions that providing predictability is a powerful mechanism to reduce apathy. For example, a short one week campaign to encourage delegation via economic incentives (or re-delegation, if your current delegate is not active) every ~three months provides predictability to voters that is reflected in traditional civic governance models. When token holders only need to pay attention a few times a year, know when those times are and are economically incentivized, they are much more likely to participate. After solving for delegation apathy, incentive mechanisms can also increase participation amongst delegates. In addition to the incentivization ideas and recommendations previously listed in this thread, this article from a16z crypto thoroughly explains a mechanism that is intended to get people to honestly report how costly they find it to vote and then pays a defined subset of voters that find voting least costly to actually vote: Paying People to Participate in Governance - a16z crypto Overall, it\u2019s great to see the depth of feedback here and we are excited to see how Optimism\u2019s governance model continues to evolve. Looking forward to everyone\u2019s thoughts and continued discussion! ",

The biggest problem as I see it, is that OP is a layer 2, and the coin we use to do everything is ETH. This leaves us with limited us cases for the OP coin, and thus people just hold the coin in their wallet and forget about it. For this reason, we need to institute measures that increase token velocity of OP, as well bring in more community engagement. For these needs and circumstances I propose the following actions: Institute real yield staking- At first the staking can be inflationary, then maybe transition into a combination of inflation and real yield rewards, and then eventually all the revenue provided to stakers is from money generated from real yield. This would give the token a dividend that would make it a useful asset to hold, but will also make it useful in all sort of DEFI applications. Staking will also take supply off the market. 6 month lock up\u2019s are a smart idea as well. I think a good example of this would be GMX\u2019s staking portal. Another option is an algorythmic stable coin backed by the OP token. A good example of this could be SNX\u2019s SUSD. The stable coin could be seperate or part of the main staking. You attach a launchpad for OP stakers- basically stakers get airdrops and IDO\u2019s of new tokens that launch on OP.  ATOM and CARDANO are good examples of this. Exclusive NFT\u2019s that can only be bought with OP. Maybe burn OP in the process. Finally, governance is hard. I think it is more efficient to copy SNX\u2019s goverance model. In this model, stakers elect a council and the council is paid, and the council makes all the decisions. This allows the stakers to elect specialists that can become knowledgable in issues and make the best decisions when voting. We should divert whatever revenue is necessary to have a properly functioning council. I love OP. ",
