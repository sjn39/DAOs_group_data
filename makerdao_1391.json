The tokenized ETFs are backed 1:1 with the underlying asset. The MIP6 application is targeted to start its Greenlight polling on 18-July.

We will host:  Adam Levi @backed-finance - Co-founder   Agenda    Intro by @juan & @retro  Presentation by @backed-finance 's co-founder Adam Levi Community Q&A   [MIP6] Declaration of Intent \u2013 Invest in short-term bonds \u2013 Proposal for implementation     The MakerDAO Community recently approved the MIP13c3-SP12 33 proposal. In it, the DAO asked providers to put forward proposals towards designing and executing an asset allocation strategy to gain exposure to short-term bonds, taking into account the particular characteristics of the protocol. Backed Finance AG 25 (BF) is a Swiss company, which has developed a fully compliant solution for issuing tokenized versions of tradable securities, including short-term bond ETFs. This is implemented via its fully owned SPV, Backed Assets GmbH 5 (BA). Switzerland has long been at the forefront of developing innovation-friendly regulations to foster the growth of an ecosystem with a strong and well-understood rule of law. Most recently, in July 2021, the Digital Ledger Technology Law (DLT) 5 came into effect, allowing the existence and transfer of digital asset securities on permissionless venues. BF\u2019s solution is based on the issuance of openly transferable tokenized structured products under Swiss law, fully-backed by the underlying bond ETFs in a dedicated collateralized account, that would allow MakerDAO to gain exposure to short-term bonds without having to off-ramp crypto to fiat or leverage any real-world structures. In our view, this should be Maker\u2019s endpoint for asset-liability management: token markets in permissionless collateralized exposure to asset classes outside pure crypto. BA has filed for a Prospectus with the Liechtenstein FMA, for both professional and retail investors within the EU/CH. The prospectus was recently approved. The project has been in the works for approx. 18 months. The project, which is sponsored by reputable investors, is state-of-the-art for TradFi infrastructure and is based in a friendly jurisdiction.

Thank you for joining episode #45 of the Collateral Onboarding Call. Today we have another exciting project: Backed-Finance, with one of the co-founders Adam Levi, to explain how they tokenize ETFs backed one-to-one.

We have security agent risk. Who is the security agent, and how are they rated? How is token issuance controlled, or is it a multisig wallet? 15:57 - Retro: Is the link to the prospectus in the MIP6 application? 24:05 - Renuka Gupta: How would pricing work when trading on Uniswap? 26:10 - ElPro: What is the total expense ratio on this IBTA? Can you please provide more details on how the KYC/AML process is enforced? Is it via someone like Fireblocks? 28:33 28:36 - David Krett: What is the total market for the IBTA proposed for Maker? Will Maker be the only investor in this product, or will it be available to other investors? 30:20 - ElPro: Can the ETF be expanded to more exposure than just a single country government bond? 31:49 - Retro: Do you have any other projects on the roadmap to work with and a similar partnership with Maker, or is it solely focused on the Maker\u2019s ecosystem? 32:47 - Tim Black: Who maintains the IBTA price oracle? 33:24 - David Krett: This is closed off to US Investors but are there any restrictions on token transfers? Is there a risk if the tokens are transferred to US Investors? 34:59 - ElPro: Would the IBTA oracle only be updated at market close? 35:52 - Retro: I looked up the performance of the iShares $ Treasury Bond 1-3yr UCITS ETF USD. Since inception, it has only return 5%(2017-2022). Can you provide color as to why it has such a performance? 36:38 - David Krett: To a certain extent, does this restrict liquidity? 38:07 - David Krett: But if we are holding the tokens and we are swapping them in the PSM - will it need to be made clear in advance? 40:51 - ElPro: Why is it your ten thousand five hundred dollars from 2020 now worth less; ten thousand four hundred? Is that because when deals go up, bond prices go down? 41:49 - ElPro: When it comes to Backed-Finance, do you gather your base in Switzerland? Is there anything that protects any DAO from having their assets frozen because it is going through a swiss company? 43:46 - ElPro: Have you already released other ERC20 tokens? Are you able to post that on the MIP6 application? 44:27 - Retro: What is the best way to get ahold of you?  Closing Comment  Retro  Outro 44:53  Thank you, Adam, for coming out today. Everybody be prepared to see the green light poll posted on Monday. Keep up to date at forum.MakerDAO.com. We will see you next time.   Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary.
