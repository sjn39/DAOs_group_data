                    "content": "I am suggesting MakerDao implement the following in the long term: We will look at this at each price level for simplicity.  I used USDC as an example but it can really be a basket of collateral including all sorts of stable coins etc\u2026   .990 MakerDao raises stability fees and if necessary increases DSR rate   .995 MakerDao drains all remaining PSMs and buys Dai after that it raises rates and follows usual plans to get Dai price up to $1.00   1.00 MakerDao drains 1st PSM debt ceiling $10M to buy Dai   1.00-1.02 The peg floats and regular market participants profit from moving the Dai price back and forth between $1.00 and $1.02 the most.   1.02 MakerDao opens 1st PSM to swap $10M Dai for USDC   1.03 MakerDao opens 2nd PSM to swap $25M Dai for USDC   1.04 MakerDao opens 3rd PSM to swap $50M Dai for USDC   1.05 MakerDao opens 4th PSM to swap $100M Dai for USDC   $1.06 MakerDao opens 5th PSM to swap $200M Dai for USDC it also lowers the liquidation penalty on collateral in the system to 5%   $1.07 MakerDao opens 6th PSM to swap unlimited Dai for Crypto Assets   To make sure the system does not end up with too much exposure to certain collateral types (USDC for example).  As I suggested Here  it would loan those collateral types out at better rates for Dai or whatever is most efficient for the system. This is a very simple view of the whole picture of MakerDao Dai price.  It would allow a stable Peg between in most cases $1.00 and $1.02 but in extreme cases could float up to a max of $1.07 or, down below the peg depending on how aggressively MakerDao acts, temporarily.  MakerDao would be making a lot of fees at any price since it would be doing so much lending and swapping of assets for Dai.  Demand for holding Dai balances with Demand for borrowing Dai and locking collateral in the system.  If MKR holders want to they could tighten the range and start running PSMs even lower than $1.02 but in this example I wanted to make things as simple as possible. ",

The proposal involves a series of steps, including raising stability fees, draining PSMs, and opening new PSMs to swap Dai for USDC and other crypto assets. The post also suggests loaning out collateral types to maintain a balance and generate fees. The proposal is explained in detail, and a 3rd party may ask questions or provide constructive criticism.",

This post is an attempt to show everyone my overall view of things and if the range needs to be tighter it definitely can be tightened down to whatever the limits will allow over the long term (I mean something like PSMs starting at $1.0025 and maxing at $1.05 with a liquidation penalty being set to 4% it maybe even doable).  I think this is all sustainable, but the game theory guys have to weigh in on that. ",

So you\u2019re saying in the long-term picture, DAI should always have a Target of $1.00 to $1.02, similar to what Hong Kong has done with it\u2019s peg to the US Dollar? I think the mandate is to keep the currency trading at HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per U.S. dollar. When it gets too close to one end or the other, they intervene, either by buying or selling dollars. Don\u2019t you think an unstable range of $1.00 to $1.02 will deter startups from using DAI? ",
