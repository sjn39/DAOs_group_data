Peter Graham  Peter Graham has been actively involved in financing entertainment companies and film production for over thirty years. Since 2005 he has partnered with Stephen Hays on 120dB Films. Before 120dB, Mr. Graham was a Managing Director of the Lewis Horwitz Organization (LHO), one of the premier companies specializing in financing independent film and television production. Prior to LHO (1997-2005), he was a Vice President with Union Bank of California\u2019s Entertainment Department (1992-1997) lending to independent film productions. Mr. Graham began his entertainment financing skills with First Interstate Bank from (1990-1992). He is a graduate of the US Merchant Marine Academy and has an MBA from UCLA\u2019s Anderson School of Management. Mr. Graham has expertise in complex international film financing and distribution. He has also provided consulting services for debt restructuring. His specialty is developing creative deal structures encompassing both debt and equity.

He is a frequent speaker on industry panels and a lecturer for university courses. Brandon Fidanque  Brandon Fidanque has been an analyst at 120dB since 2013. Prior to joining 120dB, Brandon worked for 6 years at the Los Angeles accounting firm Miller Kaplan Arase LLP in the royalties and licensing division. While there, he conducted royalty audits on behalf of film and TV producers, recording artists and video game developers to ensure they had been properly compensated. He graduated from Stanford University in 2002. An avid film fan before he worked in the industry, Brandon loves helping independent films get made. 120dB has an extensive track record and over 100 film and television executive producer credits (some of which can be viewed here). Its managing partners, Stephen Hays and Peter Graham, have a collective 50 years of experience in the film finance industry. Underwriting Strategy:  Sourcing  Most loan opportunities are generated from 120dB Films\u2019 deep industry relationships with producers, sales agents, entertainment attorneys, tax credit brokers, allied banking institutions and alternate lenders and financiers. Other loan opportunities arise as a result of brand awareness that has been generated over 18 years of marketing and networking at most of the major film festivals and markets, as well as Stephen Hays and Peter Graham\u2019s extensive list of Executive Producer and \u201cIn Association with 120dB Films\u201d credits displayed on screen and in printed art (DVD\u2019s and film posters).  Evaluation  Once a potential borrower has approached 120dB Films seeking a production loan, 120dB Films will evaluate the package using metrics appropriate for each type of collateral (generally pre-sales, tax credits, and gap). 120dB Films commonly lends against multiple collateral types at once; in such circumstances 120dB Films will structure as multiple sub-loans, each accruing interest at a different interest rate based upon 120dB Films\u2019 assessment of the underlying repayment risk. Listed below are the primary loan categories and more information regarding the loan appraisal process, appropriate metrics and due diligence performed before approving and funding a potential loan. Tax credit loans are loans secured by the expected future proceeds of state or sovereign tax credits and rebates. Numerous states and countries have incentive programs designed to induce producers to produce films or TV programs in their respective jurisdictions. These incentives are primarily designed to promote local economic development and to highlight the sponsor\u2019s unique cultural and other features. Generally, the proceeds of rebates and credits are not available to producers until the film has been completed, and additionally a final audited cost report has been submitted and approved by the appropriate governmental agency. Tax credit loans discount the expected proceeds and make funds available to producers for production. Each tax incentive program is different and subject to change, here and abroad, and continuous monitoring is a key part of 120dB Films\u2019 lending due diligence. In some jurisdictions, the state simply issues a check for the incentive amount once the process is complete. In other programs, the tax credit must be sold or transferred to a third party, which usually entails a haircut of 10% to 15%. For all tax credits, 120dB Films\u2019 baseline advance rate is usually 90%, which allows for some cushion in case of a shortfall in the final credit amount. We adjust this advance rate and 120dB Films\u2019 tax credit loan interest rate based on a variety of factors including:  review of current rules and program details for requested jurisdiction; review letter of pre-certification from incentive program; consultations with leading tax incentive specialists on current state of incentive program; conversations with local film commissioner responsible for processing applications/claims; review budget with production accountant and consultants to confirm qualifying spend; confirm completion guarantee will bond qualified spend where possible; assess statutory timeline for filings and payments; determine current market price and recent range for tradable credits.  Pre-sale loans are loans secured by underlying pre-sale contracts wherein a foreign or domestic buyer agrees to provide a future payment in order to acquire the rights to distribute an entertainment property in a specific territory. Similar to tax credit loans, the proceeds from such contracts are generally not due until the film is finished and delivered to the buyer in accordance with pre-specified technical requirements. The necessary presence of a completion bond assures that the film is delivered in satisfaction of the contract terms, dramatically reducing the risk of late delivery or buyer rejection. 120dB Films adjusts these advance rates and 120dB Films\u2019 pre-sale interest rate, based on a variety of factors including:  size, industry position, reputation and prior relationship with pre-sale buyers; for larger pre-sales, a review of buyer\u2019s current financials, often with non-disclosure agreements; conversations with sales agent and with friendly industry lenders regarding buyers\u2019 financial status, payment history, etc.; contract provisions requiring 20% non-refundable deposit for all buyers; confirm no buyer exploitation rights until all payments made; notice of assignment (\u201cNOA\u201d) requirement to ensure payments made directly to lender.  Gap financing is a last-in / first-out senior loan secured by all assets and rights of the Borrower. It is generally expected that gap loans will be recouped from the proceeds of foreign and domestic distribution sales not yet made. (This is in contrast to pre-sale loans, which will be recouped from the proceeds of foreign and domestic distribution contracts already in place). For this reason, familiarity with and confidence in the sales agent is key to 120dB Films\u2019 assessment of these loan opportunities. Other factors that can affect 120dB Films\u2019 proposed gap amounts and interest rates include:  presence of a respected foreign sales agent with whom we have had prior favorable dealings and demonstrated ability to meet their minimum sales estimates; review of foreign sales estimates provided by sales agent; detailed discussion with sales agent to determine basis for estimates and degree of comfort; appraisal of agent\u2019s reaction to essential elements (director, cast, genre, script); presence of 3rd party guarantees or other credit enhancements; confirmation of agent\u2019s willingness to reduce sales fee until gap loan covered by acceptable sales; confirmation of no agent or other marketing expenses to recoup prior loan; presence of minimum of two arm\u2019s length, primary foreign territory sales to confirm values; intention of Borrower to obtain a completion guarantee to assure timely, on budget film delivery; presence/amount of cash equity by Borrower behind gap and deferred producer fees;  Finishing funds loans are senior secured, last-in / first-out loans to producers who require additional funds to complete their projects and deliver to buyers. Many finishing funds requests are from producers of films that are not subject to completion bond guarantees, where owing to cost overruns or loss of investors, insufficient funds are available. In some instances, even films that are covered by a completion bond require additional resources and prefer to seek capital privately instead of calling on the bond. Yields on finishing funds loans are similar to those of gap loans, but finishing funds loans often contain shorter maturities and lower minimum returns to reflect likely shorter durations. Additional due diligence items are listed below:  interview producers and assess reason for overage/shortfall; confirm presence, or not, of completion guarantor; confirm presence of sales agent and obtain/review sales estimates/pre-sale agreements; introduce project to respected agents if not already retained and obtain opinion on likely values; assess availability of alternate collateral including tax credits, investor/production company guarantees, etc.; review current state of the film and obtain input from industry professionals; review budget to complete and flag excessive or unnecessary items; retain, at prospective Borrower\u2019s expense, consultant to confirm budget to deliver; interview post-production supervisor and assess budget and adequacy of loan request to deliver; assess nature/character of existing financiers and related interparty / intercreditor agreements; insist on producer/other deferrals to minimize necessary costs.  Prints and advertising, or P&A, refers to the costs to create a film\u2019s physical exhibition prints and support the marketing campaign for theatrical release. For a variety of reasons, producers often chose not to engage third party distributors to manage a film\u2019s theatrical release. This may be due to an inability to agree on commercial or strategic terms with established distributors regarding cash advances, P&A expenditure commitments, revenue sharing, etc. In other instances, producers have been unable to attract distributor interest and/or prefer the economic model of self-distribution. We are frequently approached by smaller distributors that have an interest in distributing a specific film but seek outside financial resources to support their campaign. Prints and Advertising Loans have risk characteristics similar to finishing funds and gap loans, and are priced accordingly, although often with shorter durations and lower early payment provisions. 120dB Films\u2019 goal is that shortly after funding under a P&A loan, much of the loan becomes covered by receivables in the form of minimum guarantees or advance payment deals from rights buyers (i.e., TV, video, VOD payments). 120dB Films will rarely look to recover more than a modest percent of a P&A Loan from box office results themselves. Additional analysis conducted for these Loan requests is listed below:  interview producers to understand reason for self-distribution; review of assembled team and past experience/track record; review subject film internally and present to industry veterans for input; review financial structure and additional collateral available to support the loan (tax credits, foreign unsold territories, uncollected pre-sales, etc.); review P&A campaign budget and estimates, retain independent consultant to assist in review; analyze comparable film results in each of the above categories; stress test estimates for loan coverage to meet minimums required; confirm availability of meaningful equity upside, often in form of gross points; assess expected release timing and review competitive landscape; with assistance of consultants, confirm target markets and demographics consistent with material; insist on meaningful fee deferrals from producers/marketing managers until loan recoupment; insist upon Notice of Assignment or Directions to Pay from theatrical exhibitors or bookers, and all other unpaid rights holders.  Bridge loans are senior secured loans to producers that need immediate funds to prepare for pre-production (down payments for talent, director, locations, etc.) or for projects that are already in the early stages of production. Generally, a bridge lender will make funds available to producers to get them through this period pending full financial closing. Gap loan, pre-sale loan and tax credit loans are document-intensive processes that can sometimes take several months to close, particularly with large institutional bank lenders. In addition, conditions to loan closings generally include, among other things, obtaining deposits and notices of assignments under pre-sale contracts, directions to pay for tax credits, etc., and often don\u2019t coincide with producers\u2019 financial timing requirements. A prudent bridge lender will assess the timing and risks of financial closing, assess its willingness to inherit the underlying loan, and proceed accordingly. More aggressive bridge lenders are sometimes willing to advance funds expected but not yet received from equity investors or production companies. 120dB Films has an extremely cautious approach to bridge loans. Unless the underlying loan that will take out the bridge is one that 120dB Films would be willing to otherwise originate and hold to maturity, then 120dB Films will reject the loan request. Under no circumstance will 120dB Films bridge equity or other non-senior loan commitments. Other criteria for assessing potential bridge loans include the following:  confirm expected closing and assess remaining hurdles; determine status of pending legal analysis including clean chain of title, status of contracts, etc.; review contemplated interparty / intercreditor agreements for potential conflicts, impediments to closing; communicate with the committed senior lender and obtain status of closing items; conduct similar gap, pre-sale and tax credit analysis to confirm underlying collateral value; review budget, finance plan and completion bond to confirm adequate funds available to complete/deliver/hit bond strike price.  Commitment letter / Long-form legal documentation Once we achieve comfort with all aspects of the above, 120dB Films issues a binding commitment letter to the prospective borrower outlining the terms and conditions of the offer to finance. In some instances, the letter may precede certain necessary elements being fully in place (future acceptable pre-sales, additional approved casting, etc.), and closing will be subject to satisfaction of such conditions. Due diligence continues until the moment of closing. After both parties execute the commitment letter, 120dB Films moves to comprehensive legal due diligence and proper loan documentation. 120dB Films believes that their outside counsels\u2019 legal analyses and the loan documentation rival the best in the industry. Necessary documents for closing include, but are not limited to, the following:  Loan and Security Agreement: establishes the legal obligations outlining 120dB Films\u2019 financial commitment, the loan terms and conditions, and the various obligations of the borrower. The loan will further be evidenced by a Promissory Note. Liens: all loans have perfected security interest with public security filings such as UCC-1 and/or Mortgage of Copyright and other filings pertinent to local legal requirements as determined by outside legal counsel. For loans secured by a government subsidy/tax credit/cash rebate, legal protection is achieved, depending on the jurisdiction. This can be done by an assignment of the benefits if it is assignable, or by the direction of all payments into an account over which a charge has been granted in favor of Lender. Completion Bond: mitigates completion and delivery risk. The completion bond is issued by one of the established completion guarantors. They assure the Lender that the feature film or television production will be completed and delivered by a date certain, on budget and in accordance with the contractual requirements contained in the distribution agreements. Lab Pledge Holder Agreement: provides security on the film\u2019s physical materials. Power of Sale: provides Lender the ability to sell the film to repay outstanding obligations in the event of default without the need to foreclose. Interparty/Intercreditor Agreements: ensures 120dB Films\u2019 interests are protected in the contractual relationship between all other parties including 3rd party lenders. Notice of Assignment: assigns all receipts from the film\u2019s worldwide exploitation directly to the Lender. Further Notices of Assignment in favor of the lender will be entered upon with each distributor who licenses the film in their respective territory. Producer Representation Letter: producers personally attest that the funds will only be used for production, no incorrect representations or warranties have been made to Lender and that they have personally reviewed the film\u2019s budget and elements and believe the film will be delivered on time and on budget.   Monitoring  Once all legal documents are executed and 120dB Films has funded the loan, 120dB Films attempts to step back and let the producers make a high quality film without interference. 120dB Films is a financier, not a creative, and 120dB Films\u2019 input would likely be counterproductive. 120dB Films does make a point of checking in once or twice a month with the producers, the sales agent, and the bond company to ensure that everything is proceeding as planned \u2013 following both the planned budget and the planned timeline. Once the film is complete, then loan recoupment begins. The foreign and domestic distributors are invoiced and start to pay their license fees. The sales agent can start to aggressively market the finished film to new potential buyers in unsold territories. The production accountant closes out the books on the production and prepares materials for the tax incentive applications and tax return submissions. 120dB Films monitors all of these processes, staying in frequent communication with all parties.  Exiting Loan Positions  Exit strategies from 120dB Films\u2019 loans vary depending on the nature of the underlying loan. In general, the loans are paid off over time from first dollars (subject to limited sales fees or corridors) generated from the agreed underlying collateral (i.e., tax credit proceeds, pre-sale payments). 120dB Films expects to hold most loans until maturity or until full collection in the instance of default, and underwrites accordingly. Loan repayment for most loans usually takes between 14 and 18 months from inception, although in certain cases it can take substantially longer (for example, extended tax credit repayment schedules in certain states). Less commonly, 120dB Films will also exit loans by selling for par plus accrued. The decision to sell down loans is a function of the remaining loan balance, duration and perceived risk, the implied remaining yield calculated at the proposed acquisition price, and the availability of other attractive loan opportunities and liquidity requirements. When 120dB Films does sell loans prior to full recoupment, it is often the Borrower who purchases it.

This can make recovery time appear to be longer than it actually was, assuming that the vast majority of the loan was recovered and a small amount was left outstanding for a longer period of time. The year 2014 is an example where this methodology adversely affects the data, as a loan which was almost fully recovered was unable to be accounted for as such for an extended period of time.

In its 17 years of operation, 120dB Films has a total cumulative charge-off rate of 0.6%, for an annual average loss ratio of approximately .035%. While interest income is not displayed, there were no years of its operations in which 120dB did not recover a greater amount of principal plus interest income than principal invested.  2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token Structuring: 120dB intends to use a structure similar to that of 6s Capital. A more thorough walkthrough of this structure can be found here. The overarching concept of the final structure (which will be presented with documentation after a successful conclusion of the greenlight poll) will be \u201cset it and forget it\u201d as it is intended to be managed by a professional third party. This application has (to date) one specific material term that MKR holders should be aware of:  The requested stability fee shall be DSR + 3%, but will be capped at LIBOR + 5%. Should MKR holders wish to raise the stability fee to a rate greater than LIBOR + 5%, 120dB Films will require 90 days notice.  Technical Specifications: 120dB intends to use MIP21 to transmit Dai to and from its Vault in an operationally secure fashion. Reporting: RWA Company LLC will fulfill any reporting requirements established by the MKR holders in the onboarding process and will provide assurances around any private data.  3. Provide a brief history of the project See \u201cOverview\u201d in section 1.  4.

I think that\u2019s fine, but we should have in advance a way to transition if we begin with LIBOR. I think SFOR is typically 5 or 10 bps lower than LIBOR, since it doesn\u2019t include the (tiny) credit risk of the banking intermediaries, so you get a true \u201crisk free\u201d benchmark. That\u2019s all in the weeds stuff, and this comment is just so those who do the details remember to include a way to transition from LIBOR later on. Sounds like an exciting application! ",

I would not recommend MakerDAO touch it unless the stability fee is significant.  The internet is destroying Hollywood from all sides whether they fully realize it yet or not.  Theatrical distribution is dying, and Covid was the final nail.  Government subsidies around the world, heavily used in production, will be drying up in the macro, political-economic climate.  Accounting opacity and irregularity has always been a pervasive problem.  But the core problem is that distribution has become increasingly oligopolized.  The dynamics are highly monopsonistic.  Those few tech and media oligopolies that control the eyeballs can access the capital markets more cheaply than any corporations in the world.  If they are not financing these deals already, one ought to ask oneself why.  They are ultimately in almost total control of the economic value chain, and can access deep capital markets at negative real rates.  The deals are too complex, too high touch, and in general require too much \u201ctrust\u201d from protocols built on the principle of trustlessness.  MakerDao will never understand the details of this deal.  And recourse to assets ultimately only means so much if one is entirely dependent on only 3 or 4 companies to monetize the assets properly.  This is a general statement, not a statement on the particular applying entity.  If you would like assistance, I am potentially available. ",

The Ice Age, as Albert Edwards originally termed it.  I believe this dynamic is deeply structural, and unlikely to change for now until there is major political-economic transformation.  All of this points to long duration growth assets, and I think crypto is the single best expression of that view.  This is not even to mention all of the many other obvious advances over the current financial system, like obviating problems of asset rehypothecation, accessibility, and transactions costs.  In so many words, I believe crypto is inevitable.  I\u2019ve been researching and investing in this space full-time for 1.5 years now, and and have decided to focus my career in this area, in DeFi specifically. My experience is mostly as an entrepreneur and in Head of Finance roles in operating businesses within the media and consumer packaged goods industries.  I have an MBA in finance. I agree in general with your comment.  But, if I might make a suggestion for MakerDAO, this is a time of currency devaluation, and that favors real assets.  Real estate.  Commodities.  Perhaps these areas also don\u2019t require as much deep specialized expertise.  Intangibles like film copyrights are also real assets, but not hard assets.  Recourse and liquidity risk are fundamentally different with them, as I highlighted above. ",

                    "content": "    theedgeofredness:  I had almost a decade of experience in film and video content approaching it as an asset class, and have financed deals myself, and have also worked internationally   I myself have happened to work with a number of large production facilities/companies, mostly in a consultant role making their IT infrastructure work to support post production editing and effects so I learned a lot simply by being around in their spaces while they worked.   Even 20 years ago the points you make were already beginning to manifest.  I could only imagine what COVID did as well as the overall consolidation via acquisition that has happened in the past 20 years across a broad swath of spaces including Media Production. One thing I found interesting was a lack of data on returns by year periods (vs just the capital recaptures) but only the following summary statement:     g_dip:  Over its operating period, 120dB has demonstrated its ability to consistently recover principal. In its 17 years of operation, 120dB Films has a total cumulative charge-off rate of 0.6%, for an annual average loss ratio of approximately .035%   My expectation here is that business and returns are somewhat feast/famine as there were spotty losses as well as business (1M to 20M over 3 years and back to 1M again)   I don\u2019t have a good feeling for how they were managing their profits against their risk profiles with rates and their borrows.   (basically what the interest rate spread was vs. risk profiles during each year). It is not clear to me what the underlying collateral will be as well as recourse but if they have a well defined 6s type structure with a clear and well known trustee as well as collateral I think I can get behind that.     g_dip:  120dB intends to use a structure similar to that of 6s Capital. A more thorough walkthrough of this structure can be found here.  The overarching concept of the final structure (which will be presented with documentation after a successful conclusion of the greenlight poll) will be \u201cset it and forget it\u201d as it is intended to be managed by a professional third party. This application has (to date) one specific material term that MKR holders should be aware of:   I have concerns though this company could get caught in a rate move that could negatively affect them and/or other issues.  I don\u2019t see anything regarding liquidation penalties here? I am generally going to be supportive of RWA, and am willing to try things as long as the DCs are held low (5-10M range). Will support this proposal to keep it moving as long as initial DC is low and the 6s type structure is clear with a well known trustee. ",

                    "content": "@theedgeofredness first of all, my apologies for the delay in replying to this. I have been traveling and I wanted to make sure the 120dB team could vet my response (coordination was difficult).     theedgeofredness:  I would not recommend MakerDAO touch it unless the stability fee is significant.   I think that this assessment misunderstands the risk profile of the borrower. This is a senior secured facility with 120dB\u2019s equity in the junior position. Additionally 120dB has a track record (displayed above) which negates the idea that they would not be a good steward of capital. I understand the sentiment and respect your experience, but I think it is not paying sufficient attention to the structure of this specific deal. Here is a reply from the 120dB team:  We respectfully disagree.  We have not seen governments backing away from their film and TV incentive programs.  Instead, in the main state and sovereign programs we bank \u2014 Canada, the UK, Australia, various US states \u2014 the prevailing trend so far has been a recommitment to public spending and support for the industry.  Domestically, in the legislative sessions that just finished, ten states increased incentive program funding and only two (Texas and Kentucky) decreased funding. Another example is the UK\u2019s establishment of a state-backed COVID insurance program.  Through most of 2020, entertainment financiers (like 120dB) refused to issue loans without COVID insurance protection, but that insurance was either impossible to obtain or punishingly expensive.  Without the insurance, producers couldn\u2019t get bank loans and indie film production came to a halt.  After the UK\u2019s insurance program came online, film production resumed there at something close to normal. You\u2019re correct that accounting opacity has traditionally been and continues to be an industry-wide problem.  That\u2019s why we don\u2019t lend against backend points or gross receipts; we only lend against distributors\u2019 contractual minimum guarantees.  There\u2019s no accounting to review or audit.  Either Universal has paid their $400K MG or they haven\u2019t.  If they haven\u2019t, we have a variety of tools and approaches to get them to pay it. You make a good point about the the broader consolidation of the distribution landscape, and the shift to digital distribution.  That shift is bringing a lot of power and control to tech and media companies.  However, our experience is that Netflix and Amazon and other streamers generally are not financing projects in this lower budget range, but they are happy to buy the rights to these films once they\u2019re made, if they turn out well.  Many of our producer partners\u2019 first sales strategy is to try to sell their completed film to a streamer.  And indeed, that\u2019s fine with us.  Netflix\u2019s money spends just like anyone else\u2019s, and we will happily lend against a Netflix distribution contract.  I hope this addresses your concerns.     MakerMan:  One thing I found interesting was a lack of data on returns by year periods (vs just the capital recaptures) but only the following summary statement:   I advised the 120dB team not to disclose specific returns beyond capital recapture. I don\u2019t think this is a good thing for a borrower to put on the internet or relevant for MKR holders in their consideration. It weakens 120dB\u2019s negotiating position with the DAO. That is the fully transparent reason, there is nothing to hide.     MakerMan:  My expectation here is that business and returns are somewhat feast/famine as there were spotty losses as well as business (1M to 20M over 3 years and back to 1M again) I don\u2019t have a good feeling for how they were managing their profits against their risk profiles with rates and their borrows. (basically what the interest rate spread was vs. risk profiles during each year)   I believe you\u2019ve misread the principal recovery section. The first section addresses only fully closed facilities, which is why you see a drop off in later years. A significant amount of 120dB\u2019s capital is currently deployed to active revolvers, which are outlined in the section immediately below the closed loans. But as I stated, there\u2019s absolutely nothing to hide here. In RWA Co.'s opinion, 120dB is an outstanding originator and should be provided with a high debt ceiling, that\u2019s why we brought them to the DAO. If you have any questions that are not answered in this MIP6, just ask. Whatever information you or other community members need to feel comfortable, within reason, I\u2019m sure we can provide.     MakerMan:  I have concerns though this company could get caught in a rate move that could negatively affect them and/or other issues. I don\u2019t see anything regarding liquidation penalties here?   The intention is to run this through a Trust structure similar to 6s Capital. The equity component that 120dB puts into each deal is effectively the liquidation penalty. If there are any losses to Maker\u2019s principal, it is 120dB that will be paying for it (up to the extent of their equity requirement, which is recommended at 10% in this MIP6 but negotiable). This is why I found the principal recovery rates to be the most relevant metric for the community\u2019s risk analysis - in its 17 year operating history, MakerDAO would not have had any issues with repayment of principal or stability fees.  It is not clear to me what the underlying collateral will be as well as recourse but if they have a well defined 6s type structure with a clear and well known trustee as well as collateral I think I can get behind that.  The collateral is tax credit loans, pre-sale loans, gap financing loans, finishing funds loans, prints and advertising loans, and bridge loans. All of these facilities are themselves de-risked by 120dB in a number of ways. To quote from the application, here are some of the protections that 120dB ensures itself in its operations:   Loan and Security Agreement: establishes the legal obligations outlining 120dB Films\u2019 financial commitment, the loan terms and conditions, and the various obligations of the borrower. The loan will further be evidenced by a Promissory Note. Liens: all loans have perfected security interest with public security filings such as UCC-1 and/or Mortgage of Copyright and other filings pertinent to local legal requirements as determined by outside legal counsel. For loans secured by a government subsidy/tax credit/cash rebate, legal protection is achieved, depending on the jurisdiction. This can be done by an assignment of the benefits if it is assignable, or by the direction of all payments into an account over which a charge has been granted in favor of Lender. Completion Bond: mitigates completion and delivery risk. The completion bond is issued by one of the established completion guarantors. They assure the Lender that the feature film or television production will be completed and delivered by a date certain, on budget and in accordance with the contractual requirements contained in the distribution agreements. Lab Pledge Holder Agreement: provides security on the film\u2019s physical materials. Power of Sale: provides Lender the ability to sell the film to repay outstanding obligations in the event of default without the need to foreclose. Interparty/Intercreditor Agreements: ensures 120dB Films\u2019 interests are protected in the contractual relationship between all other parties including 3rd party lenders. Notice of Assignment: assigns all receipts from the film\u2019s worldwide exploitation directly to the Lender. Further Notices of Assignment in favor of the lender will be entered upon with each distributor who licenses the film in their respective territory. Producer Representation Letter: producers personally attest that the funds will only be used for production, no incorrect representations or warranties have been made to Lender and that they have personally reviewed the film\u2019s budget and elements and believe the film will be delivered on time and on budget.       MakerMan:  Will support this proposal to keep it moving as long as initial DC is low and the 6s type structure is clear with a well known trustee.   Thank you for this, it means a lot. RWA Co.'s current standard of Trustee is that they are regulated and have a minimum balance sheet of $500MM. This is written into the Trust Agreement (in the event that the current Trustee resigns and a new one must be appointed) and we believe it adequately protects MKR holders. That being said, our commitment is to continually improve our regulated counterparties and transparency, so thank you for the interim trust while we continue to build our reputation with these service providers.

                    "content": "Thanks for the quick and detailed reply @g_dip.   One question.   Something I have not asked of any of the other RWA players btw. and more of a general risk analysis question.   Is there a credit rating for these RWA borrowers.   I keep thinking a lot of this stuff is looking like short term bond notes.   I would at least like to get a feeling for whether these bundled loan products (which is what this one looks like to me from the point of view of the collateral backing the debt facility) would rate on a fitch scale. I think it would be nice to have some kind of comparison of how much backing capital or skin the RWA players have in their own portfolios they are putting up for collateral. (or what this is going to look like and whether it is also specified in the structure agreements)   Then one wants to at least have a feeling of what the DC\u2019s are going to look like (what our RWA players envision) as well as growth.   I think my biggest issue here is I don\u2019t have a clear idea of collateral risk profiles.  Past history while a key metric of use for banks or other lenders to approve debt facilities may or may not be useful as a future metric especially if the RWA plans to grow dramatically. In the end analysis while I still have questions.  I believe it is more important for the protocol to take on the risk with the RWA players but to seek to contain this until Maker gets its RWA analytical legs regarding risk management, as well as how to structure portfolio risk.   The only way Maker is going to be able to manage this is by not having one huge debt facility but perhaps a few of these mostly to manage the portfolio risk structure.   I like having a simpler structure and less work, but my concern is that if we go to broad and fast regarding these RWA players with large DC\u2019s Maker portfolio risk profiles will be more at the whim of our RWA players interests and hence controlled by them.    I really want to see clean risk structures, and well delineated portfolio types in debt facilities as it makes it easier to understand overall risk and to mitigate losses to perhaps one 10-25M vault facility out of say 5-10 vaults a RWA players has available than 1 vault of 100-500M which has a problem collateral component or some kind of crazy portfolio structure. Thank you again @g_dip for putting this together.   Exciting to see RWA players lining up here!  As you know in my own analysis the only way I see Maker getting cleanly to next 6-10B in collateral is via RWA initiatives.! Most of these RWA applications if they start with DC\u2019s in the 10M range will get my support unless there is some clear flaw in structure or recourse. ",

I see anyone with 10% in the game as serious, anything under 2.5% is easily fluff in accounting.   Not to slight this particular or any other RWA but I have seen a lot of different stuff passing through all the companies I worked with and a company messing with 10\u2019s of Millions of other peoples money can easily slosh 250K (2.5% on 10M) where at 1M or above while doable is a lot harder to just slosh around on the books somewhere accounting wise.
