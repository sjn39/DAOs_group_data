Previously, though we received approval for a loan of Dai based on the submission of the appropriate application, we now understand that the process has been updated to allow for more significant information about projects involving real-world assets to be forwarded to the Maker governance for approval. As you will read in our application, Detox Digital Coin (DDC) consists of real estate within the United States that is utilized to increase the number of substance abuse treatment programs available for those seeking a solution to opioid dependency. The Portfolio represents an investment in a niche commercial real estate sector that has insulation from the effects of Coronavirus and is considered an \u201cessential business\u201d in the eyes of US federal and state governments. The Portfolio addresses a rapidly expanding market with an unmet demand: the exploding opioid crisis and the lack of treatment facilities. Our partners in this project, CRE Realty Partners, currently manage five thriving centers and anticipate acquiring a total of 20 additional centers that are specifically zoned and refurbished to provide diverse levels and stages of substance abuse programs. The funding objective is to raise $70,000,000 USD in numerous tranches - each with a minimum Cap of $3M and a maximum of $15M in accordance with the PPM. The offering price of each DDC is $1.00 and the minimum investment is $5,000 USD although the Series, in its sole discretion, may determine to lower the minimum amount. DDCs can be accessed and transferred (when and to the extent permitted under applicable regulations) through the SolidBlock platform or held directly in a digital wallet.  1022\u00d7493 110 KB  We believe that the above chart represents an accurate representation of loan rates being offered on commercial properties that are between $3-5M. We are looking to receive more favorable results from MakerDAO. We look forward to hearing that this application before the MakerDAO community, will be accepted as collateral for a loan. Intro: Detox Digital Coins ( \u201cDDCs\u201d) are real-estate backed security tokens representing an interest in the Detox Medical Digital Series, LLC (\u2018the Series\u201d) established by SolidBlock to offer investors the opportunity to participate in the the Detox Digital Property Portfolio (\u201cthe Portfolio\u201d) which manages detoxification facilities, each with its unique and licensed approach to drug and alcohol and mental health recovery. The main underlying challenge and need for the project is the opioid epidemic which is a global malady, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic with more than 93,000 drug-related deaths in 2020 in the United States (a 29% increase over 2019). Background Information 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? The interested party for this collateral application is ***Detox Medical Digital Series *** (the Series). Specifically, SolidBlock Inc. has formed the Series (Delaware incorporated) to offer investors the opportunity to participate in real estate through the Detox Digital Coin as delineated below. Main Contacts: SolidBlock: Co-Founder & CEO, Yael Tamar: [email\u00a0protected]; Co-Founder & CIO, Yuval Wirzberger: [email\u00a0protected]  Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  Project - in Brief For this offering SolidBlock, Inc., an internationally recognized pioneer in tokenization and the developer of a fully compliant tokenization platform, has teamed up with the Holdun Family Office (Bahamas) Ltd., and Omicrom Development, LLC (Delaware Incorporated) (through a joint US company - CRE Realty - Placeholder name) that seeks to raise up to USD $70M, offering interest in facilities focusing on various levels of care. The Portfolio consists of real estate within the United States that is utilized to increase the number of substance abuse treatment programs available for those seeking a solution to opioid dependency. The Portfolio represents an investment in a niche commercial real estate sector that has insulation from the effects of the Coronavirus and is considered \u201cessential business\u201d in the eyes of US federal and state governments. The Portfolio addresses a rapidly expanding market with an unmet demand: the exploding opioid crisis and the lack of treatment facilities. CRE Realty Partners currently manages five thriving centers and anticipate acquiring a total of 20 additional centers that are specifically zoned and refurbished to provide diverse levels and stages of substance abuse programs. Specifically, Detox Digital Coin will acquire facilities that address different levels of care for every stage of recovery from substance abuse. These include:  Residential Drug and Alcohol Detoxification Centers In-patient Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centers Sober Living Post Rehabilitation Residential Housing  The Series may hold, depending on the amount raised, up to 100% of several detox centers as delineated above. Each DDC is initially offered at a value of USD $1. Using SolidBlock\u2019s advanced platform on the Ethereum blockchain (the \u201cSolidBlock Platform\u201d), investors will be able to purchase this. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the sale of the DDCs (after payment of fees and offering expenses) to purchase an interest in the real property holding company, which wholly owns the medical detoxification centers. The Series seeks to raise up to $70,000,000 USD to invest in the Series which may hold, depending on the amount raised, up to 100% of several real property holding companies whom each is the sole owner of a medical detoxification center (the \u201cProperty\u201d or \u201cProperties\u201d). We expect several tranches whereby there is a minimum cap of 3M. Each Property, as of the date of this Offering has been identified, renovated, developed, and is leased via a triple net lease for a 10-year period to a medical detoxification operator. The determination of which properties are to be included in this Offering is based on the following estimated financial metrics of the potential return to investors:  Internal Rate of Return of 12% to 15%; Annualized Return of Investment of 15% to 18%; and Equity Multiple of 1.7 to 2 times investment.  DDC is a new series of Ethereum blockchain-based smart contract digital tokens consisting of software code meeting the ERC-20/1404 protocol standard as modified to meet transfer restriction requirements under applicable US securities law. The software code of the DDC Smart Contract will be based on open-source code but will be proprietary and will not be published at this time. Fractional ownership/Tokenization of real estate, in general SolidBlock\u2019s state-of-the-art digital securities platform enables fractional ownership of the underlying assets or fractional entitlement to certain rights (revenue or interest) as well as trade of assets via OTC on the SolidBlock platform or through partner exchanges. Real estate asset tokenization is an emerging trend representing the convergence of real estate investing and blockchain technology. Tokenization helps asset or fund owners raise capital more efficiently, and gives investors unprecedented access to private real estate investments, transparency, and liquidity.  960\u00d7540 148 KB  SolidBlock was a first mover in the industry spearheading the tokenization of the St. Regis Aspen Ski resort (ASPD trading on tZero).  |624x350.5073190294766960\u00d7540 550 KB  The Series, as delineated in the previous section, is the official issuer of the Detox Digital Coins. Purchases of the DDCs will be paid in U.S. dollars. The Series may accept Bitcoin (\u201cBTC\u201d), Ethereum (\u201cETH\u201d), DASH, or other cryptocurrencies as payment for DDCs. The funding objective is to raise $70,000,000 USD as outlined above in numerous tranches - each with a min. Cap of $3M and a maximum of $15M in accordance with the PPM. The offering price of each DDC is $1.00 and the minimum investment is $5,000 USD although the Series, in its sole discretion, may determine to lower the minimum amount. DDCs can be accessed and transferred (when and to the extent permitted under applicable regulations) through the SolidBlock Platform or held directly in a digital wallet. The Real Estate Assets: The addiction industry is a multi-billion dollar industry with a very deep tenant pool and moreover, our tenants are well-known national operators. With the proceeds from the sale of the DDCs, the Series will acquire an additional 20 recovery and health rehabilitation centers in prime locations within the United States to add to the Portfolio and which will be rented to qualified detox and recovery facilitators. The Portfolio addresses a rapidly expanding market with an unmet demand: the exploding opioid crisis and the lack of treatment facilities. The projected IRR is 15% with an annual 8% cash-on-cash return. Exit Strategy:. To raise and deploy 70 M USD in equity (equivalent to a 200M USD portfolio) and once we build such a portfolio, we will sell to a larger fund that has an interest in acquiring ESG investments. DDC Storage and Transparency: DDCs are held on behalf of investors by SolidBlock in a cold storage wallet, and can be accessed and traded through the SolidBlock Platform. Investors will also have the option to store DDCs in any ERC-20 compatible wallet. It is also important to understand that because they are stored on the blockchain, investors in DDCs can view a record of their investment on the SolidBlock Platform. The Series will communicate with Investors through the SolidBlock Platform or via electronic mail as to material developments regarding an investment. Investors can review their account statements online and see that they have received payments on the DDCs they own. 3. How long has the project been live in production? The project has been live on the SolidBlock marketplace since December 2021. 4. Provide a brief history of the project. The history of the project is embedded in the separate histories of the main stakeholders behind the Series - SolidBlock Holdings and CRE Realty (Omicrom Development, LLC and the Holdun Family Office) as well as the social challenge and financial/social opportunity afforded by the ever-increasing opioid crisis. Omicrom Development, LLC, reached out to SolidBlock to tokenize their project and assist in raising funds to meet the insatiable demand created by the opioid crisis for additional detox and recovery facilities. The opioid epidemic is a global malady that has damaged the economic and social wellness of many countries and its effects are not slowing down. Drug dependence among the most at-risk population has accelerated because of Covid. SolidBlock entered into a partnership agreement with CRE Realty (Omicrom Development, LLC and the Holdun Family Office) to execute the tokenization project providing the entity structuring, regulatory compliance, and technology platform. The Project Team: CRE Realty (Placeholder name) - A US Entity wholly owned by Ominicrom and Holdun* -CRE Realty has ultimate responsibility for the management, operations, and investment decisions made on behalf of the partnership. With many years of real estate transactions to its credit, CRE Realty has led investors to successful, transformative, and equitable projects. They offer consulting in all areas related to identifying up-and-coming real estate deals for the management, operations, and investment decisions of their clients. Omicrom Property Management, LLC.,* - is a Delaware limited liability company that serves as the property manager for the real estate assets held by the Portfolio. Holdun Family Office, Ltd.,* - is a major investor in Omicrom. With an extensive reserve of knowledge based on this company\u2019s five-generational investing dynasty, Holdun offers financial guidance to investors on their journey to leverage their financial security. SolidBlock is a smart contract development and management platform for tokenized assets. In other words, SolidBlock transforms real estate, a traditionally illiquid asset into tradable security through tokenization. SolidBlock spearheaded the successful tokenization of the five-star St. Regis Aspen Resort in Colorado. The Aspen Coin (as termed) was the first-ever tokenized commercial real estate project in the world whereby $18M was raised using the SolidBlock platform. The Aspen Coin was listed on tZERO in Sep 2020 (amidst the COVID-19 crisis), traded by over 800 customers with over 4-8% of its market cap traded every month. The issuance price was $1, was about $1.30 at the time of listing (30% premium), and is now about $1.20. The SolidBlock team is hustling, simultaneously, working on diverse tokenization projects for residential, commercial, and hospitality-based properties in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Moreover, SolidBlock prides itself on its efforts to advance and facilitate interoperability and regulatory standardization, thus mitigating barricades to digital markets and investing.  960\u00d7540 210 KB  Through the leveraging of these companies\u2019 wealth of experience, the Detox Digital Coin (DDC) was born. DDC provides an unprecedented opportunity for savvy investors interested in digital securities backed by one of the safest asset classes, namely US real estate, and focusing on a real-time, real-world challenge, namely the global opioid crisis. Why Detox and Recovery?. The US is experiencing an opioid crisis of an unprecedented magnitude. More than 93,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the US in 2020, the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a single year. Tragically, another 5,460 deaths were related to alcohol-specific causes. There are more than 14,000 treatment centers across the US and the number is growing. A total of 3.7 million persons received treatment in 2020, but facilities are filled to capacity and there are not enough beds. The Portfolio combines an excellent business opportunity with ESG - environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors that hold increasing interest for investors. ESG performance measures non-financial disclosures which forecast the risk, resiliency, and character of an asset. At SolidBlock, we believe that the Detox Digital Property Portfolio sets our company\u2019s standards for a socially conscious investment with promising yields as delineated within this document. 5. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. Link to the PPM: Detox Medical PPM 07252021.docx - Google Docs  1280\u00d7720 80.1 KB   1280\u00d7720 40.5 KB   1280\u00d7720 76.1 KB  Asset Information  What type of asset is it? (e.g. store of value, currency, commodity, capital asset, governance token, etc.)  Digital Security Token backed by real-world property. 7. How is the asset used and does it give any rights to holders? (e.g. financial claims, dividends, governance rights) DDCs are held on behalf of investors by SolidBlock in a cold storage wallet provided by GK8 and can be accessed and traded through the SolidBlock platform. Investors will also have the option to store DDCs in any ERC-20 compatible wallet. Because they are stored on the blockchain, investors can view a record of the DDCs and print copies of their records by visiting the investor\u2019s individual page on the SolidBlock Platform. The Company will communicate with investors through the SolidBlock Platform or via email as to material developments regarding an investment. Investors can review their account statements online and view their payments. The DDC will generally have a one (1) year holding period before US holders may freely trade the DDC on a secondary platform. Each potential acquisition has been identified, renovated, developed, and leased via an NNN lease for a 10-year period to a medical detoxification operator. The determination of which properties are to be acquired is based on the following estimated financial metrics of the potential return to investors:  Annualized Internal Rate of Return of 11.05%; Annualized Return of Investment of 12.03%; 7.23% average Cash-on-cash; and Equity Multiple of 1.6.  8. What is the market cap for the asset? The funding objective is to raise $70,000,000 USD in numerous tranches - each with a min. cap of $3M and a maximum of $15M, in accordance with the PPM. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? 9.a Provide exchange data on market liquidity, volume, and order book depth. Exchanges may occur in two distinct ways: Via peer-to-peer trading of tokens over the counter on the SolidBlock platform, following a 1-year lockup for US investors, as per the US regulation. The tokens will also possibly be listed on exchanges and ATSs with appropriate levels of licenses with whom SolidBlock works (tZero, Archax, Merj, Atlas.one, Texture Capital, Rialto, ADAX, etc.). 10. Is the asset settled on-chain (trustless) or off-chain (trusted)? The asset is settled currently off-chain. 11. If off-chain (trusted) settlement: describe what are the involved entities, process, and estimated time. The project is currently being handled manually. Detox Digital Coin management fund are the one to settle it. We project a 1-2 week estimated processing time. 12. List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed collateral type. The collateral is real estate owned by the SPV that issues a token. The data source will be the price. In other words, the question we tackle here is the price-setting mechanism. Initially, there will be an issuance price and thereafter, the price oracle will be the market fee, i.e., the price for which people are actually buying and selling. It should be noted that at this point, only the SPV is borrowing against the collateral. 13. List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed collateral type. We have several accredited investors and groups who may be interested in taking part in the liquidation of the collateral in case of default. We will need to develop the list and grow the potential investor base together with MakerDAO. Business Questions: 14. What is/are the expected use case(s) of Dai generated by the vault? The expected use case is to fund the development and purchase of new behavioral health centers across the US. 15. What is the amount of Dai expected to be generated against the collateral and what is the timeline? Is there a commitment on a minimum amount of Dai to be generated? We hope to generate up to 80% of the full value of the project as soon as possible. There is no commitment on a minimum amount of Dai to be generated. 16. What are the strategic benefits for MakerDAO in onboarding the collateral? We are offering security tokens backed by a real-world asset. The growth of this asset is linked to helping address the growing opioid crisis in the US. In addition, the benefits for MakerDAO are that this is real-world collateral as opposed to a digital asset and is linked to a well-funded private equity company. Legal Questions: 17. What are the legal risks associated with the tokens? Blockchain technology mitigates risk in the investment process. We have the ability to freeze trading on behalf of the issuers. Let\u2019s say you want to move back to paper \u2014 we would freeze trading and re-issue paper. You would endure some reputation exposure, some administrative expense, and some dashed investor expectation as to liquidity, but none of those are catastrophic. This is not like cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether where if you lose control of them, you have lost that asset. This investment is a real-world asset that has a cryptographic representation. The asset is still there and you still have a real-world cap table. 18. (Optional) Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? The special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the project is a US limited liability company formed in Delaware, namely Detox Medical Digital Series. In the US, the DDCs are being offered and sold only to \u201caccredited investors\u201d (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act) in reliance on Regulation D under the Securities Act. Internationally, as a compliant way to raise capital outside the US, we are using Reg S. Reg S investors from outside the US can be of any wealth level. 19. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. We have created an official PPM and are raising funds under Reg D 506 C, Reg S, and Reg CF. Our token is a security token. 20. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. As mentioned above, we are using Reg D 506 (c), Reg CF, and Reg S for which we have filed or will file Form C and Form D with the SEC. We are registering with Edgar. All the subsequent links will be provided in the comments section. 21. Is the issuance of the asset decentralized (trustless) or centralized (trusted)? 21.a. If centralized/trusted: by which legal entity, type of entity, and jurisdiction? The issuance is centralized. The interested party for this collateral application is ***Detox Medical Digital Series *** (the Series). Specifically, SolidBlock Inc. has formed the Series (Delaware incorporated) to offer investors the opportunity to participate in real estate through the Detox Digital Coin as delineated above. Technical Questions: 22. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract-focused audits. The smart contract was built based on the Ethereum network, ERC 1404, https://erc1404.org/, audited by Pessimistic. Link to the audited smart contract: audits/SolidBlock Security Recheck.pdf at main \u00b7 pessimistic-io/audits \u00b7 GitHub. The PPM (Private Placement Memorandum) has been prepared and reviewed by our legal team, which includes our in-house counsel, Mr. Israel Frenkel. 23. Has the token (and/or supporting protocol) been formally verified? Previous SolidBlock smart contracts have been audited by KPMG and Ernst & Young. This issuance will also be verified formally by a 3rd party. The DDCs have not been, and will not be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the DDCs are being offered and sold only (i) to \u201caccredited investors\u201d (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act) in reliance on Regulation D under the Securities Act and (ii) in offshore transactions to persons other than \u201cU.S. persons\u201d (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act. See \u201cPlan of Distribution.\u201d U.S. persons seeking to invest will be required to provide documentary evidence of their accredited investor status satisfactory to the Company. 24. Does the asset follow a token standard? (E.g. ERC20, ERC721, ERC1400) DDC is a new series of Ethereum blockchain-based smart contract digital tokens consisting of software code meeting the ERC-20/1404 protocol standard as modified to meet transfer restriction requirements under applicable US securities law. The software code of the DDC Smart Contract will be based on open-source code but will be proprietary and will not be published at this time. 25. Is the asset, or asset balances, controlled by a central actor, or group of actors (e.g. through a multisig, or DAO)? SolidBlock has teamed with Holdun Family Office (Bahamas) Ltd., and Omicrom Development, LLC (\u201cCRE Realty Partners\u201d), to offer interest in an exciting medical detoxification center in the United States. The CRE Realty Partners developed the Medical Detox Portfolio initially acquiring several locations and anticipating acquiring a total of 10 -15 locations specifically zoned and refurbished to provide drug and alcohol medical treatment. The Detox Portfolio represents an opportunity to invest in a niche commercial real estate sector that has insulation to effects of the Coronavirus, considered \u201cessential business\u201d in the eyes of the Federal and State Governments. Facilities are inpatient, medically necessary for life facilities, and are experiencing an uptick in need. 26. Does the token have whitelist or blacklist functions? If so, what is the process for utilization and what stakeholders are involved? Yes, the tokens have a KYC/AML verification function using ERC-20/1404. Stakeholders are approved, token investors. We either internally conducts or contract out certain compliance services to meet KYC, AML, OFAC, and Rule 501 accredited investor compliance. We believe ours and its internal procedures and vendors meet industry compliance standards. However, the SEC or other regulatory agencies could determine, for example, that we have failed to use \u201creasonable steps\u201d for verification of accreditation status. This determination could result in penalties to us, a loss of some or all returns for certain investors, a potential revocation rights for affected investors, as well as a delay in payments to investors, cessation of our operations, or other adverse effects on holders of Units. 27. Can the token implementation be upgraded/changed? If so, what is the process and what stakeholders are involved? There are some management functions that mostly cannot be changed unless there is a reissuance. The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without the approval of the holders of the DDC, to exchange the DDC and the Units for rights in another entity, including a REIT. Such entities shall assume all of the assets, rights, and obligations of the Series and the governance terms shall be substantially similar to those of the Series. If the Company exercises such rights, the Company may reincorporate in another jurisdiction or transfer its assets to another jurisdiction or the Series may transfer the Property to another entity in exchange for interests in such other entity. The Company cannot predict whether it will exchange the DDC and if it does, where the new issue of the Units will be formed. Any determination by the Company to exchange the DDC and Units may result in it becoming more difficult for Investors to enforce the terms of the Units. 28. Does the token contain rebasing logic? No. The following questions apply to RWA collateral onboarding applications only: 29. Provide (a) proposed legal structure for transaction, including: type of legal entities, (offshore/onshore, form (trust, corporate, other)) and jurisdiction(s) of legal entities, and (b) likely funds flow (DAI => Fiat => DAI).

Identify in reasonable detail the risks associated with this collateral application and the underlying asset(s) and proposed mitigants (if any). The risk summary should address, without limitation and to the extent relevant: market risks, commercial risks (e.g., diversification, credit, etc.), interest rate risks, legal and regulatory risks, general industry risks, competition, etc. The DDC offered hereby are highly speculative in nature, involve a high degree of risk, and should be purchased only by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s investment objectives will be achieved or that a secondary market would ever develop for the DDC, whether via the SolidBlock Platform, via third-party registered broker-dealers, or otherwise. The risks described in this section should not be considered an exhaustive list of the risks that prospective Investors should consider before investing in the DDC. Prospective Investors should obtain their own legal and tax advice prior to making an investment in the DDC and should be aware that an investment in the DDC may be exposed to other risks of an exceptional nature from time to time. The following considerations are among those that should be carefully evaluated before making an investment in the DDC. Risks Related to the Structure, Operation, and Performance of the Company The Series was recently formed and has no track record and no operating history from which you can evaluate the Series or this investment. Our Company was recently formed and has not generated any revenues and has no operating history upon which prospective Investors may evaluate their performance. No guarantee can be given that we will achieve our investment objective. Given our start-up nature, Investors may not be interested in making an investment and we may not be able to raise all of the capital we seek for the Company this could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the value of your DDC. Due to the start-up nature of our Company, there can be no guarantee that we will reach our funding target from potential Investors. In the event we do not reach the funding target, we may not be able to achieve our investment objectives by acquiring assets to generate the interest payments to Investors. Our success depends in large part upon our Manager and their ability to execute our business plan. As our Company has only been in existence since January 20, 2021, and the Series was designated in July 1, 2021, and our Company is an early-stage startup company, it has no significant operating history within the real estate sector, Failure of management to successfully operate and build our business could result in your losing your investment in the DDC. The success of our Company (and therefore, our ability to make the payments with respect to the DDC will be highly dependent on the expertise and performance of management and the officers and employees of one of our Managers, of the Property. The loss of the services of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Property and the Project, in particular, their ongoing management and use to support the investment of the Investors.
