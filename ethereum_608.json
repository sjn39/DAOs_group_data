I would like to create a strategic postmortem of sorts to discuss what was potentially blocking investment in upgrades to the current Ethereum. I chatted about this briefly with @lrettig last week and we\u2019re curious to get more views on it.    Hypothetical maximum scale of Eth 1.x   Another import caveat: as @karalabe and @AlexeyAkhunov eloquently explained in their Eth 1.x proposals, any attempt to scale today will immediately exacerbate the state and storage size issues, so any meaningful scaling (of Eth 1.x or 2.0) is still blocked on that.   In my own reading of the 1.x proposals and recent Ethereum dev/release history, I get the impression that certain clear pathways to scale Ethereum were held back by awareness that any major improvement on mainnet would lead to an unsustainable run-up in state size. For \u201cstrategic postmortem\u201d reasons, what I\u2019d like to know is: was state size the primary blocking issue on moving forward? Was it a wish to improve development processes in 2018, rather than work on forking changes? Or was it \u201cEthereum 2.0 has this\u201d? I think that @cdetrio, @karalabe, and @5chdn might be able to shed the most light on this, but we\u2019d all be interested in any relevant perspective! ",
