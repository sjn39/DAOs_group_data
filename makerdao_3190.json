                    "content": "We haven\u2019t talked about the DSR for a long time since we decided to keep it at 0% in September. We did this, because we were heavily above peg and had ~0% stability fees. Since we fixed the peg and made major steps to improve the supply side of DAI (LP tokens, 101% LR stablecoin vaults, and finally the PSM lerping up to 500M), we should now start to look at the demand side of DAI. Let\u2019s face it: a uncensorable stablecoin is not providing an edge in the stablecoin competition. It is a nice thing for all crypto maximalists, but the average Jane and Joe will look for something different that we can offer: earn interest on DAI. Compound has the DSR already integrated, so does Coinbase. My bet: if we can make DAI favorable compared to USDC and Tether, we will get a lot of demand. We do have the tools in place or about to get to production (LP tokens as collateral, IAM for DCs, PSM so everybody can be sure we stay pegged to USD) to provide the supply. We can go ballistic on DAI demand by providing a non-zero DSR, that will eventually also lead to more 3rd party integrations. Obvious downside: we are losing a non negligible fraction of the fees. But we are in the very beginning of the stable coin market and I rather not make any money for a year and instead claim the #1 place in the competition. Right now we are doing a good dollar of fees per second, I hope we are going to laugh about this in a year.  Next Steps I would like to kick off the discussion about raising the DSR again here. I have no idea what would be reasonable: is 0.25% enough? 0.5%? 1%? even more? Or is this just a stupid idea? I hope for some  here, in case there is even a slight chance of the community likes this idea, I will set up a Signal Request on that topic in a couple of days (kind of a lesson I learned from my infamous ETH-B-DC-signal: let\u2019s first discuss before setting up poll) - hopefully leading to an on-chain poll.

The money distributed via the DSR is then redistributed throughout the rest of the economy through various means. If there is not enough Dai in active circulation (i.e., not tied up in contracts or positions) then demand rises, and then either the price must go up or the supply must increase. An increase in supply, in our case, means more stability fees in the long run. My proposition is this: If we sprinkle a little extra Dai on the crypto-economy, surplus (no matter how small) will follow and people will find uses for the extra Dai. That creates velocity, which increases demand, which as stated, will bring us more fees. Thoughts? ",

With regards to the peg there is presently no reason to increase the DSR to above 0%, demand for DAI is as high as ever. However, when looking at this from a system perspective there could be good reasons for increasing the DSR as we as a community should observe how the wider ecosystem responds to a DSR increase. What we could do is to steadily increase the DSR to levels to at least compete with a normal US savings bank account. If we consider online banks as the benchmark a DSR of about 1% should do it. Problem is that other defi players such as Aave have much higher rates on deposits so I kind of doubt it will have any effect. ",

Another idea is using 0.01% of our earning to support liquidation of small Vault owners. Returning the dust value to an acceptable level will bring more value to the protocol.
