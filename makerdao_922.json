(\u201cPando\u201d) is offering Investment Grade climate assets to MakerDAO which will allow Maker to promote DAI as \u201cclean money\u201d by backing it with climate positive collateral, bringing stable financial returns to Maker while simultaneously enabling the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  Paragraph Summary MIP73. Pando enables protocols like Maker to collateralize their protocol with climate assets. While many climate assets are more \u201cgreenwashed\u201d than effective, Pando enables protocols to earn a yield while meaningfully preventing greenhouse emissions. The first clean energy asset that Pando is offering to Maker is a $210M pool of rated solar loans (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). The climate assets supporting the Maker loan are cash flows from PV Solar installations on residential rooftops. The Transaction is highly structured, and the pool of solar loans will be rated Investment Grade by a US Credit Rating agency (Kroll Bond Rating Agency, or KBRA). As a result of this Transaction the company originating the loans will be able to increase their deployment of solar. Also, the Transaction provides Maker with an opportunity to demonstrate how cryptocurrencies can pioneer innovative, lower cost financing structures in clean energy. Of note, Maker is in the senior secured position ahead of Pando, providing significant protection in any downside scenarios. Maker will fund the full $210m as part of a single Tranche at closing for the Transaction. Principal and interest payments made to Maker on the full amount will commence directly after closing. Last, this Transaction will not tokenize the solar loans, and as a result Pando will coordinate with the Real World Assets Team on a MIP21. This MIP, importantly, also details strict conditions for the setup of the underlying legal and governance structure and attestation requirements.  Motivation  The team members of Pando have been helping to finance climate solutions for decades. When we read \u201cThe Case for Clean Money\u201d, we realized that there is a deep mission-alignment between ourselves and the Maker community. We believe there is a profound opportunity to use DeFi to accelerate climate solutions. We think DeFi investors can both earn a good risk-adjusted return and support the deployment of renewable energy projects that prevent greenhouse gas emissions. The assets in this Transaction enable individual homeowners to go solar, meaningfully changing their relationship with their own energy generation and the climate. These rated assets are investment grade that provide the stability and risk profile that the Maker community has signaled a preference for in the past. This Transaction places Maker among blue-chip financial institutions that currently lend to the same type of assets from the same Originator. These institutions include BNP Paribas, New York Life, Royal Bank of Canada, TIAA, PIMCO, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, among others. The Pando team is uniquely qualified to invest in, structure, and manage these assets for Maker, and collectively Pando has more than seventy years of experience in renewable project finance across more than $70B of projects. This Transaction will enable Maker to diversify its reserves from non-yielding assets to cash flow generating green assets. Maker can capture the momentum of the White House, SEC, the UN, and others to dramatically advance the clean energy economy.  \u201cPresident Biden knows that we need to move even faster to combat climate change\u2026reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 \u201d  White House, February 28, 2022   \u201cThe SEC Will Regulate Climate\u201d  Bloomberg News, March 22, 2022       Component Summary MIP73c1: Background of the Borrower (Pando) This component details the background of the Borrower, Pando.

Specification / Proposal Details  MIP73c1: Background of the Borrower (Pando) (This component is informational) Demand for solar energy has been increasing exponentially as the cost to install solar continues to drop. According to a recent UN study, we need to deploy $2 trillion annually to meet climate targets by the end of the decade. While climate technology has been proven to work and the demand is there, traditional financial institutions are not responsive enough to keep up with the growing demand. Pando believes MakerDAO and other crypto protocols can be a critical player in accelerating the adoption of climate solutions globally while earning a stable return. Pando was created by the founder and CEO of Solar Mosaic, Inc. (Mosaic) and the former product lead at Mosaic, which has financed more than $7B of solar loans and issued several billion (USD) in rated solar debt instruments. Pando\u2019s four principals have decades of combined experience in energy finance and have collectively structured or participated in more than $70B of renewable projects. Highlights of Pando\u2019s Principals include:  Founding team of Mosaic, Navajo Power  Senior leadership at US Department of Energy\u2019s Loan Programs Office  $60B in total energy loans across wind, solar, geothermal, EVs, and nuclear $465M loan to Tesla, the catalyst for the Model S $2.6B distributed generation project, first ever for Bank of America and a leading Real Estate Investment Trust   Created, deployed, and managed a ~$500M, SEC-registered solar tax equity Investment Advisory firm Senior leadership at New Energy Nexus, Core Capital, Sparkfund, and other leading energy/finance companies More info on the team at PandoClimate.Co   The Pando principals are supported by world class Advisors, including KPMG (tax), Perkins Coie, and Morrison & Foerster (legal). Pando\u2019s mission is to radically accelerate the flow of capital into climate solutions by bringing high quality climate assets to crypto protocols.  MIP73c2: Rating Agency and Borrower Underwriting Processes (This component is informational) Both Mosaic and Pando have best-in-class underwriting processes. For example, Mosaic spent years establishing a public rating methodology with Kroll Bond Rating Agency. An Investment Grade rating signifies the risk of default in the underlying assets is extremely unlikely. Also, Pando utilizes a Risk Underwriting Model against which the Principals have developed and deployed billions of dollars. The Pando model has been reviewed by public accounting firms and institutional investors - all of whom have declared it best-in-class. KBRA will analyze the pool of solar loans in the Transaction using the General Global Rating Methodology for Asset-Backed Securities and the Consumer Loan ABS Global Rating Methodology, as well as its Global Structured Finance Counterparty Methodology and ESG Global Rating Methodology. The Transaction falls within the \u201cCategory 1 \u2013 Financial Assets\u201d categorization noted within the Global General Rating Methodology for Asset-Backed Securities, which typically relates to transactions that are backed by pools of consumer or commercial financial obligations owed by diverse obligors.  1243\u00d71600 104 KB Example: Kroll Rating for Mosaic Solar Loans In applying these methodologies, KBRA analyzes the Transaction\u2019s data and the underlying collateral pool and analyzes the capital structure using stressed cash flow assumptions. Pando and its legal counsel also will review operative agreements and legal opinions prior to closing. The following table provides a summary description of the underwriting criteria that Pando uses to evaluate distributed generation assets like the Transaction. Each category has multiple subcategories and percentage valuations, and scores are assigned for each subcategory in order to comprehensively evaluate the creditworthiness of the project.  1280\u00d7596 28.7 KB   MIP73c3: Background of the Originator (Mosaic) (This component is informational) The pool of solar loans that comprise the Transaction are originated by Mosaic, one of the most respected climate finance companies in the world. Mosaic has originated more than $7 billion in loans since June 2014. It is a California-based specialist finance company that enables homeowners to go solar by providing them a loan to cover the cost of solar installation. Often, homeowners save money because their monthly solar loan payments are cheaper than their previous utility bills. This Investment Grade Solar Transaction represents a diversified portfolio of loans (across thousands of U.S. homeowners), all enabling decentralized renewable energy generation. If this proposal is approved, this capital will allow Mosaic to deploy even more residential solar in the U.S. Mosaic originates loans to mostly prime credit quality homeowners through its partnerships with more than 700 approved solar system installers/dealers. Mosaic disburses funds directly to installers, equal to the system cost minus installer discounts. This discount depends on the loan term and dealer agreements and is generally netted out proportionately with each disbursement to the installer/dealer. Mosaic directly originates loans in 48 states and the District of Columbia through its state lending licenses where required, and across all 50 states and the District of Columbia through lending partnerships with financial institutions. The following bullets detail additional information about Mosaic:  Mosaic has issued loans to partners like Tesla, SunRun and SunPower. Current loan purchasers are publicly traded financial institutions (e.g., BNP Paribas, New York Life, Royal Bank of Canada, TIAA, PIMCO, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, etc.). Pando & Maker will lend similarly like these institutions. Mosaic finances residential solar installations by lending directly to creditworthy homeowners Homeowners usually save money by installing solar Homeowner owns/maintains system and makes payments against the loan Mosaic pools loans into a \u2018warehouse\u2019 facility; those pools are then formed into tranches that receive a Kroll rating based on an established underwriting methodology Mosaic bundles and sells solar loans to financial institutions This is an efficient, cost-effective way to capitalize Mosaic loans. Selling to these institutions allows Mosaic to deploy even more solar.   MIP73c4: Benefits to Maker from the Transaction (This component is informational) The following bullets provide some of the benefits that will accrue to Maker from the Transaction.  The Transaction will generate a stable return to Maker from climate-focused, highly-structured, rated cash flowing assets. The Transaction is novel as it will be the first funded by a cryptocurrency, solidifying MakerDAO as the pioneer of a new financing structure for renewable energy. This structure allows DAI to be backed by \u201cclean\u201d, stable cash flows from renewable assets. The technology used for the solar systems is commercial grade with substantial warranties for design, workmanship, and installation. The Transaction poses no technology risk for Maker. The Pando team is deeply experienced in sourcing, diligencing, structuring, and managing similar assets to the Transaction. The structure of the Transaction is repeatable, and significant demand exists for similar transactions. The Pando principals are confident they can structure several billions in similar transactions once the template is complete with this Transaction. While the Transaction will have a private rating of Investment Grade, there may be an ability to increase the returns from projects with different risk profiles in future transactions. This Transaction will capture the momentum of the White House, SEC, and other regulators and influencers as they push to dramatically advance the clean energy economy.  \u201cToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is making major leaps forward on wind, solar, transmission, and other clean energy projects \u2026 to deliver affordable, carbon pollution-free electricity across the country\u2026 that demonstrate the Administration\u2019s unwavering commitment to creating cleaner and cheaper energy\u201d  White House, January 12, 2022       MIP73c5: Process Optimization This proposal is a self-contained collateral onboarding proposal of a RWA collateral construct that is in its final stage and ready for immediate execution upon voter approval, using its own optimized assessment and verification processes. If this MIP is approved, the collateral onboarding is immediately moved to step 5 of the Collateral Onboarding Process Overview of the Collateral Onboarding Process - Collateral Onboarding However, the standard assessments described in the Collateral Onboarding guide do not apply to MIP73, as they are not relevant for an RWA onboarding of this type. Instead, a process providing equivalent protections to the spirit of those assessments is done as specified in MIP73c6 and MIP73c7, and these assessments take the place of the standard assessments and allow it to move forward in the process.  MIP73c6: Legal and Approval Structure Verification This proposal is based on the precedents set by the 6S Trust structure approved by the community in MIP13c3-SP4, as well MIP21, which has been active for more than half a year. These precedents have successfully demonstrated the ability to securely interoperate between the Maker protocol and Real World Assets, as evidenced by more than $9.4 million of real world assets financed. The legal structure is designed to include these characteristics:  This is a single Transaction, not a series of transactions. Therefore there is no ability to change the terms once the Transaction is complete. Principal (the borrowed amount) and interest will be paid to Maker on a monthly basis. Interest will be paid to the Maker Protocol surplus buffer, while Principal will be returned to the Maker vault. Third parties will not have access to the funds or be able to change the terms or legal structure. It should not be possible for a third party to block Maker Governance\u2019s ability to make decisions or modify the structure. There must be no ability for funds to be misappropriated or get stuck. Details on how to deal with an Emergency Shutdown will be developed and incorporated during the RFC phase of this MIP.  This above established structure must set up a relationship with a regulated crypto broker, and an immutable ETH address must be emitted that can be used to construct the smart contracts necessary to complete the technical step of the onboarding process specified in MIP73c8. The following slides demonstrate the detailed flow of funds (DAI and USD), as well as the legal entities and approvals. Pando will work with the Real World Asset Team to ensure the Transaction remains consistent with the 6S Trust Structure, and that the protections for Maker are clear and strong. A high level summary of the transaction is below.  800\u00d7450 200 KB  The following section summarizes the responsibilities of the primary parties to the Transaction:  800\u00d7450 198 KB  Maker Trustee  Delaware (DE) Statutory Trust - (for example, Wilmington Trust) Independent, 3rd party Ensures all capital flows are approved and accurate The Maker Trustee confirms that the Transaction meets all requirements and that all Conditions Precedent (CPs) have been satisfied prior to execution. The Maker Trustee also provides irrevocable instructions to Pando on whether and when to fund the Transaction.  Maker Foundation Company:  Entity that will be the conduit for funds from Maker Vault through to the Delaware Statutory Trust. Exact entity structure (e.g., Trust, or Foundation, etc.) will be confirmed and established in conversation with the Maker Real World Assets Team.  Pando  Serves as Administrative Agent and Lender to Mosaic Structures, approves, and manages the Transaction. Confirms all Conditions Precedent have been met prior to funding Mosaic loan. Manages the Servicer, oversees all loans, and remedies any issues. Ensures the entire structure is compliant with tax and accounting regulations.  Verification After this MIP has been approved, in order to allow the MIP73 collateral onboarding to occur as described in MIP73c8, the Real World Finance Facilitator and the \u201cin SES incubation\u201d Facilitator of Legal and Transactions Services must, through a public forum post, provide a Verification of the de facto implemented legal and approval structure\u2019s appropriateness for holding a large amount of real world asset collateral for Maker. Pando vault will not be granted a debt ceiling until these verifications have occurred.  MIP73c7: The Transaction and Transaction Restriction Verification As outlined in the legal structure and flow of funds in MIP73c6, Pando will enter into a Loan Agreement with the Maker Delaware Statutory Trust that restricts Pando\u2019s use of Maker funds to the uses described in this Transaction, specifically only for Pando\u2019s acquisition of Mosaic Solar Loans. Pando proposes borrowing DAI from MakerDAO to acquire $210M of Solar Loans from Mosaic. The following bullets provide details on the Transaction:  The Transaction is collateralized by real world climate assets, specifically loans for PV Solar installations on residential rooftops. These solar assets generate electricity, reducing demand from the grid and greenhouse gas emissions. Mosaic will pool the solar loans into one tranche that is highly structured and rated by a US Credit Rating agency, KBRA. The solar loans are packaged and structured so that the total pool of loans when taken together will be rated as Investment Grade. The Transaction will represent 6,000-7,000 US residences, and the homeowners will have a weighted average FICO score of 700 or greater.  Given the assets are Investment Grade, the Transaction yield will typically be 1.25% with ROIs ranging from 1.04x-1.08x, depending on the underlying tenor of the loans. The weighted average life of the Transaction will be 5-6 years.   Mosaic will service the loans, and Pando will direct/manage Mosaic as the Administrative Agent. In the event Mosaic is unable to perform, there is a contracted back-up servicer that can seamlessly step into their role.  Maker is lending against contracted cash flows from residential loans, not against the installed solar equipment.  Maker has the most senior credit position in the waterfall against the cash flows. Additional credit enhancements include:  Maker is in a senior, over-collateralized position within the cash flows. Maker is entitled to approximately 90% of the cash flows from the Transaction, ahead of all third party fees and Pando\u2019s junior position within the waterfall. In addition, a reserve account - sized and funded at closing - will cover any potential consumer defaults.  Historically, Investment Grade rated entities default at an annual rate of 0.03%-0.3%. The Transaction\u2019s base case underwriting model will assume a 1% annual and cumulative 7.5% default rate. Historically Mosaic has achieved recoveries on default of 20-30%.   If the reserve account is depleted and Mosaic\u2019s position is depleted, then Pando\u2019s Administrative Agent fees and junior cash flows will be used to service Maker debt.   In the event of a homeowner default, the Servicer will access the Reserve Account to ensure timely payments of Principal and Interest.  A sample Solar Loan is $75,000, with a monthly payment of approximately $3,750. The Reserve Account is sized at 1% of the initial Transaction value.  The Servicer would attempt to get the homeowner paying again, and if they are unable they will recover an average of 20-30% of the system cost.   However, if we assume $0 in recovered capital from defaulted homeowners, more than 530 homeowners (out of approximately 7,000) would need to simultaneously default to deplete the entire Reserve Account.  As a reminder, Investment Grade assets typically default at 0.03%-0.3% annually, or up to 20 homeowner defaults annually.   In addition, Maker will stand in front of Pando and other service providers in any downside scenario, meaning the Reserve Account is not the only protection available to Maker. If the entire Reserve Account is depleted, it would take another 200-300 simultaneous homeowner defaults to occur before Maker\u2019s Interest payments would be impacted. In total, 700-800 homeowners would need to default to impact interest payments to Maker. However, it is important to note that in the event Maker\u2019s interest payments are compromised from homeowner defaults, any unpaid interest will be accrued and paid from future cash flows. In other words, substantial, unforeseen homeowner defaults could delay, but will not erase Maker\u2019s return.    In summary, for Maker\u2019s interest payments to be delayed, homeowners would need to simultaneously default at 25x-35x the typical Investment Grade annual default rate.  So the Transaction waterfall looks like:  Maker DAO Servicer (Mosaic Solar) Administrative Agent (Pando Climate Inc.) Pando Solar 1 (SPV) Cash Reserves (pre-funded)  The Transaction will be structured by Pando and Mosaic, with support from Societe Generale (the \u201cStructuring Agent\u201d). Verification After this MIP has been approved, in order to allow the MIP73 collateral onboarding to occur as described in MIP73c8, the Real World Finance Facilitator must, through a public forum post, provide a Verification that the Transaction restrictions of the de facto implemented Legal Structure guarantee that it will execute a transaction with terms as described in this component.  MIP73c8: Technical Conditions of the Collateral Onboarding and Technical Verification The Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit will, with support from the Protocol Engineering Core Unit and any other relevant Core Units, deploy smart contracts that hard code the ETH Address emitted by the legal structure specified in MIP73c6, and follow the MIP21 framework. These smart contracts must only allow for the generation of DAI through a vault that is sent to the ETH address of the legal structure as its ultimate destination, and it must not be technically possible to send the DAI elsewhere, in accordance with MIP21. There must also not be any additional technical features or complexity that goes beyond the minimum necessary smart contracts and dummy constructs to enable the generation of DAI and its transfer to the ETH Address emitted by the legal structure. The ability to initiate the generation of DAI from the vault and trigger their transfer to the immutable ETH Address emitted by the legal structure is given to an Ethereum address controlled by Pando, which is specified through a public forum post by a Pando representative. This address must have no ability to access the funds. Verification In order to allow the MIP73 collateral onboarding to occur as described in this MIP73c8, the Collateral Onboading Services Facilitator must, through a public forum post, provide a Verification that the technical implementation of the Vault are in accordance with MIP21 and is technically secure enough to receive a large debt ceiling.  MIP73c9: Specification of Executive Vote When the collateral onboarding process for MIP73 has progressed to step 7, and with the conditions specified in MIP73c6, MIP73c7 and MIP73c8 met, an executive vote must be created (or code must be bundled into a broader executive vote) that activates all permissions for the vault to be onboarded based on the smart contracts specified in MIP73c8. The Vault must provide:  Debt ceiling of DAI 210 million Stability fee of 0% (surplus is paid manually through the legal structure, as specified in MIP73c6) All other parameters must be set to ensure they have no functional impact.   MIP73c10: Collateral Onboarding Cancellation Procedure The collateral onboarding can be canceled at any time by the community through a standard or urgent signal request process. This will remove the block on onboarding collateral through non-MIP processes as specified in MIP73c5, nullify the permission to create the executive vote, or bundle its code into another executive, as specified in MIP73c9, and formally remove MIP73 from the Collateral Onboarding process. The goal is that this option should never be necessary, as the combination of collaboration/coordination and already undertaken efforts, in and around this subject, should allow the collateral onboarding to happen swiftly after the approval of the MIP. If it becomes necessary to use the cancellation feature regardless, this would be considered a significant failure of protocol coordination and execution, and in most cases the proposer of this MIP should expect to lose their trust and reputation in the community. This risk helps ensure that only the most serious proposals by the most competent proposers will be willing to use this process.  MIP73c11: Unilateral Instant Collateral Onboarding Withdrawal After this MIP has been approved, Pando can at any time through a public forum post, unilaterally withdraw the Collateral Onboarding application. This nullifies all aspects of MIP73c5, MIP73c6, MIP73c7, and MIP73c8, and instantly removes the Collateral Onboarding block specified MIP73c5, and formally removes MIP73 from the Collateral Onboarding process. This option allows the proposer to prevent their reputation from being damaged by forcing the community to spend time and energy on performing a MIP73c10 cancellation procedure, if some unforeseen issue should arise after the approval of the MIP. Pando is committed to immediately use the unilateral instant collateral onboarding withdrawal should any kind of legitimate issue arise that would complicate or slow down the verifications necessary to enable the collateral onboarding.

We believe the credit characteristics of this pool of assets will be largely similar to Mosaic\u2019s most recent offering. Apologies my prior note wasn\u2019t clearer \u2013 our debt to Maker will be our capital costs.     teej:  A private bond offering is cheaper than a public bond offering though, right?   In time they can be, but not usually for a first transaction between parties for a unique structure. Mosaic has not done a private sale of something that is usually a public offering before, and there aren\u2019t many similar offerings to compare against. Pando covers the structuring fees to SocGen, rating fee to Kroll, and legal fees for both our transaction with Maker and again for the transaction with Mosaic. Pando will be obligated to pay most/all of these costs whether our proposal with Maker is consummated or not. We will also cover the servicing Fees to Mosaic, fees for the Collateral and Paying agents, and any other fees that result from our negotiations with Mosaic over time. Maker\u2019s return is protected \u2013 all other fees and expenses are paid outside of that return.     teej:  Should MakerDAO decide to fund the full 210 senior to Pando, it\u2019d be the sole senior funder, correct?

Mosaic included the Structuring Agent in our term sheet, but we have not yet had a chance to confer with them on SocGen\u2019s expected role and cost. We will update you once we have a better handle on their role. However, Pando is playing a prominent role in structuring the transaction in that we have formulated the legal structure, are using our underwriting model, and verifying the Kroll methodologies are applied appropriately.     teej:  Yield lower or yield higher?   Our junior yield is lower than Maker\u2019s senior yield, which is atypical given our spread is at risk. For Maker\u2019s interest to be at risk our entire position would have to be eroded; we are in the first loss position. However, we know what we\u2019ve structured is new, and in the interest of business development we are open to discuss compressing that yield further once we have the terms of the Mosaic deal finalized.

                    "content": "@teej, in reading through @MorganPando\u2019s reply I figured there\u2019s additional context that might be helpful. As Morgan said, Mosaic hasn\u2019t done a private offering like this before. That\u2019s partially the case because there\u2019s been an intense demand from TradFi (e.g. the major financial institutions we named in the MIP) for Mosaic\u2019s assets. Previous securitizations have been oversubscribed, and ESG investing pressures are mounting dramatically for many TradFi institutions. They want reliable revenue-generating climate assets like Mosaic\u2019s, so Mosaic has been able to meet its own needs so far via public offerings. However, Mosaic (and the solar industry in general) are growing very quickly, and Mosaic is willing to try a new structure with Pando. Part of why they are willing to do a unique structure is because of our deep history and relationship with the org. Additionally, Mosaic\u2019s original vision and business was actually a crowd-financing business for Solar (back in ~2010). In a way it was a proto-DeFi marketplace for solar, but it came to market too early before blockchain, DeFi, and the current regulatory environment. Mosaic eventually pivoted it\u2019s model, but I believe there is a deep desire at Mosaic to tap into new ways to democratize access to climate investing, and they see Pando as the right strategic partner to explore ways to make that happen.

However, Treasuries are a fundamentally different product in that they are coupon only until maturity \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t get your money back until the end of the term. Also, Treasuries do not support climate assets, which Pando understands to be a priority for Maker. In contrast, the proposed Transaction will generate Principal and Interest payments to Maker immediately, with a weighted average life of 5-6 years. We believe that quick return of capital combined with the security of the opportunity makes the Transaction an attractive opportunity compared to Treasuries. That said, we do understand that purchasing Treasuries could be valuable in addition to the Transaction, particularly if liquidity for a portion of your portfolio is a consideration. If return is more important, we are able to bring higher yielding opportunities to Maker that would not be rated but would still go through our rigorous underwriting criteria. ",

Thank you, @teej. I\u2019ll try my best to answer. In short, yes we do believe the Transaction is market. However \u201cmarket\u201d can be a difficult concept to define here as Mosaic has not done a private offering before. The market for Mosaic public offering rated-bonds are the yields we have presented and you referenced. In another sense, since Mosaic has not done a private rated sale before it is tough to say there is a market comparison for this Transaction (this is particularly true as private sales are not usually rated). While we have used that public security as a base for our Transaction, the proposed return to Maker is influenced by several factors: 1. The Transaction does not come from a public auction; 2. Maker doesn\u2019t otherwise have access to these assets; 3. Pando will incur costs that public purchasers typically don\u2019t pay; and 4. Pando requires a return for our work as well. When taken together, we believe an experienced bank would agree that the proposed return to Maker is reasonable.  This transaction provides a reasonable risk adjusted return to Maker for an asset class that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be available.  Can you confirm our understanding that Maker prefers rated, lower risk transactions, like we\u2019ve structured here? If Maker would prefer, we are able to provide an unrated transaction with the same originator, which would increase the yield to Maker. One other consideration is if Maker was able to transact directly with Mosaic (like BNP, New York Life, etc.). In that instance you would have to cover the upfront costs outlined above that Pando will incur which a typical lender doesn\u2019t pay. In our Transaction, we are covering all of the fees and costs associated with the deal, including ones we haven\u2019t tied down yet (e.g. converting DAI to $). We think it is very encouraging that Maker intends to consult with an experienced lender. If you are amenable, we would appreciate speaking with them once you\u2019ve had a chance to discuss the Transaction.     teej:  So Pando will retain a 10% first-loss slug or more? Will Mosaic retain any risk?   This is accurate. A vast majority of each incoming payment will go to pay your Principal and Interest; another portion will go to the various service providers (as outlined above), and then finally the remainder will go to Pando. But your P&I are the lion\u2019s share of each payment. Mosaic takes risk in that they do not receive their Servicing Fee (0.35% of the outstanding principal annually) for any asset that is in default. In other words, if a Solar Loan doesn\u2019t perform, Principal and Interest is still paid from the Reserve Account, but Mosaic (and Pando) don\u2019t get paid. ",

Lets assume Pando purchases 100 Face value oF Mosaic collateral.  What will the resulting securitization structure look like, as outlined below.  I have put some guesses in as a starting point.

(Annual) Mosaic Loan Pool Interest  (100*2.9%)    = 2.90 Maker Bond Interest (851.25%)              = 1.0625 Pando Bond Interest (151.2%)                =  .18 Servicing & Other Fees (100*.45%)          = .45  TOTAL INTEREST AND FEES                  =1.6925 KEY QUESTION:  the Mosaic Loan Pool generates 2.9 in interest while the bond interest and other expenses costs only 1.69.  Where does the other 1.2 of interest go? I must be missing a key expense\u2026 UPDATE: My best guess is that Mosaic is charging Pando a high price for the loan pool and this added cost is being reflected in the low yield for Maker.  Mosaic is selling its loan pools in the public bond securitization market at 100% (per face value of underlying loans).  If this is true, Mosaic is capturing much of this \u2018missing interest\u2019 in some manner.  A key question is what price is Mosaic charging Pando for the comparable loan pool and how is the loan pool sale deal structured? We needs Pando\u2019s guidance here\u2026 ",

                    "content": "I appreciate Pando bringing this proposal and rather than dig into details I prefer to go right to the basic question: Why would Maker buy a loan portfolio that matures over a 12 year period at 1.25% when we can buy US Treasuries that have 1 year maturity at same or higher rate?  (literally last check has 1 yr US Treasuries at 1.67%). I can see why at 2.9% and 10 yr maturity these might be interesting but I have a real hard time believing that given the recent and significant rise in rates (an inversion of the short vs. the long T-bill yields) that this deal would sell as offered. I have listened to RWF here on what Maker should be looking for in RWA and while many components of this proposal may meet certain criterion the one it fails to my mind is whether Maker can get a better deal (i.e. does this price really represent current market).   I personally believe this deal fails this one critical test miserably. I also want to point out that very careful attention to the term on RWA maker onboards.   Given that inflation is running at 50 year highs there is a real interest rate hazard that Maker could get trapped into if we don\u2019t pay very special care to term and rate risk on RWA.   Right now I personally don\u2019t think Maker should get into anything much over 12 month terms with rates (after all fees) at least at 1% (I personally want to see 2 or 3% honestly if we can get it with reasonable risk profiles). One point I find interesting as it was specifically noted in this proposal, that I want again for RWF to clarify on, because if this proposer thinks this structure is good enough to launch a proposal based on the structure, others will as well:     Dori:  This proposal is based on the precedents set by the 6S Trust structure approved by the community in MIP13c3-SP4, as well MIP21, which has been active for more than half a year. These precedents have successfully demonstrated the ability to securely interoperate between the Maker protocol and Real World Assets, as evidenced by more than $9.4 million of real world assets financed.   Last time I heard anything about 6s from RWF was that the recommended DC was 0 due to issues with existing legal structure.   Which if I am correct means the same structure makes this MIP73 unsuitable from a legal structure standpoint. Please correct me if I am wrong RWF team. I am also going to make a general point here regarding \u2018prioritization\u2019 in these MIP proposals. I believe it is important for Maker to communicate in a timely manner to MIP6 applicants and to resolve applications, but I do not believe it should be up to applicants to decide the priorities of Maker and MakerDAO.  I believe prioritization is done through a partnership with governance and CUs to satisfy mutual performance goals and this needs to be communicated effectively to applicants.   I don\u2019t like being put into the following position but sometimes people need to take a stand. This delegate is putting RWA applicants on notice. I, when looking at any MIP applications am going to be less favorably disposed to supporting applications with an affirmative vote if such MIPs contain language specifying how MIPs will be prioritized. Reasonable Time frames for actionable activities and communications yes, prioritizations no. ",

                    "content": "I think the most important thing to understand is that this deal, and others like it, only really make sense in the context of the clean money vision. We either choose to be greedy and contribute to the demise of the planet and economy as much as everyone else (sucks to hear it but its the truth of how our economy works right now), or we try to make a difference by using the power available to us as a DAO operating a financial system. If we choose to be sustainable while everyone else chooses greed, we can\u2019t expect to make the same return, or get the same liquidity (at least initially while the world is still refusing to transition at the civilisational scale that\u2019s required). It\u2019s just obvious, just like you are gonna make much more in crypto if you spend your time as an anon dev churning out ponzus vs trying to build something safe and solid that creates financial inclusion or similar. However, the point of the clean money vision is also that, despite knowing that we cant get the same financial return for sustainable assets (in the short term at least), we can extract an even greater PR and brand value from such assets. This only works if we are truly committed to clean money, by becoming actually net sustainable. Greenwashing is completely pointless and then its better to just be honest and take the greedy route. But if we pull that off and prove that with defi you can actually go beyond greenwashing and create a financial system that is truly sustainable, then projects like these will not just have a financial return, they will also have an intangible return in that it allows us to market ourselves and communicate with our future users and stakeholders like real world politicians in a completely different that sets us apart from the crooks that otherwise run the financial system. So this deal alone might seem like it makes sense in isolation compared to something like USTs, but it takes us one step closer to a future where we are able to have a collateral portfolio that is incomparable in value to USTs or any other simple financial asset. Another thing, that I think would be helpful, is if Pando could try to estimate how the efficiency could improve at larger scale. That will help further illustrate how this can be seen more as a first step. ",

I\u2019m very sorry you had to go through this trial by forum post Pando, especially when two other applications are basically doing the same thing. But whoever advised you to bring this proposal should have helped make sure there was either more yield or a really concrete case on why the incredibly low yield is justified. I hope you can find some extra yield somewhere, because a lot of us are really interested in green projects. But there\u2019s a limit to how much subsidy can be given. Maker has to watch out for its own solvency and steep discounts on a deal that if it went bad would bankrupt us just isn\u2019t in the cards. ",

                    "content": "There is another key point:  how will investing in off market assets impact DAI stability? Lets think about this carefully.  Maker has about 6.5B of DAI outstanding that isnt crypto-loan backed - I view this as Demand DAI as holders can demand that it be redeemed at par at will.  How are these folks comfortable that their DAI is solid?  By seeing that it is backed by rock solid collateral! Suppose Maker invested all the $6.5B tomorrow in great Green assets but at off market rates, say Maker overpays by 10% which appears to be what Pando is asking.  This absurd hypothetical analysis makes some key points. How will the Demand DAI holders view these new investments that are backing their DAI?? Well, Maker will need to get regular prices on its Green investments (RADICAL TRANSPARENCY!) from quality pricing agents so the Demand DAI holders know the quality of the assets backing their DAI.  Guess where these pricing agents will price the Green assets?  90 cents on the dollar.  So now the $6.5B of Demand DAI is effectively backed by Green assets worth $5.85B in the open market. How are Demand DAI folks going to think about their $6.5B of DAI backed by collateral worth only $5.85B in the open market?  That is the key question.  If 100% of the Demand DAI holders are solidly committed to the Green initiative, things may be OK.  But the Demand DAI is seriously under collateralized if there is a liquidity run.   Unless there is at least ~$650MM of surplus to cover this gap. From a game theory perspective, if a decent number of Demand DAI holders are worried about the undercollateralization of the DAI, it will be fully rational for them to sell their DAI quickly as possible as the early sellers should get back par before the peg is broken.  And once other DAI holders perceive that the early DAI folks are rushing to exit, it becomes rationale/compelling to exist DAI quick as possible, as only the early redeemers will get back par.  Once the peg is broken (an emergency shutdown?), the remaining DAI holders will likely need to wait until all the remaining assets are sold at 90% and get back their pro rata share of the recovery which will likely be less than par. So this simple game theory analysis guides Maker that is better keep its \"Green\u2019 subsidies for its assets manageably small or the DAI will likely implode. ",

Having observed the dialogue on this proposal, I was relieved to see that the community asked the same questions that would come up if private lenders were participants in the transaction. I am also encouraged to see that this community is so serious about the green finance situation. The fact of the matter is, the greatest impact DeFi can offer is to help in places where the yield expectations are so high, or so impossible, that nothing can get financed properly. I work alongside people who have worked on large numbers of renewable projects in countries with low GDP; the biggest challenge, by far, is decoupling the financing terms from the financial situation of the underlying sovereign. I recently saw a transaction in which the lenders wouldn\u2019t fund a solar deal with a 10% yield because the country\u2019s bonds were trading higher. The Maker community seems to be prepared to consider those sorts of transactions, which is exciting. If Maker is going to finance deals based upon their green credentials, I would ask that the community considers requiring applications to demonstrate that the use of the MakerDAO / DeFi financing mechanism has intrinsic benefits that assist in decarbonization that would otherwise be impossible. The community could then evaluate whether rooftop solar in the world\u2019s richest country, in which a diverse range of low interest rate financing options are available, fits this criteria. If not, the deal could be evaluated purely on merits as a yield-generating asset, as has been done in these comments. ",

The link you posted referencing those returns are for project equity, not debt.  With equity, Maker\u2019s invested capital would be fully at risk, and you would be the last party paid in the transaction. There is no certainty that you would be paid any return.  Investing in equity requires active monitoring and management of the investment, so that you\u2019re fully aware of all aspects of the project performance, accounting, etc.  Our recommendation is that if you prefer to make equity investments, you should not settle for 6-16% returns, as that is low for equity.

                    "content": "Maker Community, You\u2019ve mostly heard from Dori and Morgan with the Pando Team, but I\u2019m jumping in as both are away with their families.  There has been a fair amount of really interesting commentary, and instead of trying to address each comment individually, we thought it would be helpful to write a comprehensive reply.  Hope that is ok.  As Dori mentioned earlier, we also are available to speak with any CU and/or delegate who might be interested in digging into ideas. In no particular order:   A few folks have compared our MIP73 transaction to a Treasury bond.  While both investments offer security, this asset is very different from a Treasury bond.  With Treasuries, all you have to do is purchase the bond \u2013 no added costs, or any particular skill/qualification, underwriting, servicing, etc., required.  Those Treasuries are perfectly fine investments \u2013 although most financial institutions don\u2019t put all their low-risk eggs in the Treasuries basket.   To clarify our MIP73 structure - this is not a bond purchase, but a back-to-back loan issuance: a) Maker to Pando, and b) Pando to Mosaic. Pando would use the Maker capital to loan against the entire solar loan pool, and then pay Maker back from the pool cash flows. The Mosaic interest rate would flow to Pando - we would pay the first dollars to Maker, then to the fees, and then Pando retains the remainder.   The similarity between MIP73 and Treasuries is that both the MIP73 opportunity and Treasuries are low risk to Maker.  For MIP73, Maker is the most senior position in the waterfall and the project would need hundreds of homeowners to default in order to impact your return.  Our view is that this MIP73 opportunity is just the beginning of projects that we could do with Maker \u2013 but in this space, borrowers want to know that the lender is serious and has the ability to execute.  That\u2019s part of the reason why we proposed this relatively simple transaction as a first foot in the door for Maker.   Renewable energy projects (distinguished from energy companies) require debt capital, and most projects try to use as little outside equity as possible.  In order for these renewable projects to be competitive with traditional energy projects, they need as low a cost of capital as possible, hence the reliance on debt over equity.  Traditional lenders like the Mosaic assets because they provide contracted cash flows, no technology risk, no construction risk, and a stable alternative to Treasuries.  These traditional lenders of course also invest in Treasuries, but they diversify their investments for many reasons.   Purely from a positioning standpoint, we believe there is value for Maker to be in the same category as BNP, Credit Suisse, NY Life, PIMCO, and other leading global institutions.  Foremost, it signals to other renewable energy project developers that Maker can transact in this space.  That is important because when compared to the number of \u201clenders\u201d that exist in the world, very few actually invest in energy projects.  It is a niche space, and mostly filled by a small number of US and EU project finance lenders (there are others outside those markets, for sure).   Most renewable energy projects do NOT have ratings associated with them \u2013 they use traditional project finance structures and rely on their own underwriting.  Getting a rating is a time consuming and costly process \u2013 but Mosaic undertook that in order to further lower its cost of debt.  The benefit of what Mosaic did by getting the rating is that it begins to treat renewable loans as just another type of financeable asset, which makes it easier to lend to projects around the world (not just in traditional markets).  Maker participating in these loans further demonstrates that cryptocurrencies are an important part of the financing solution for renewable energy \u2013 again, not just in the US but across the globe.   We noticed some reference to Venture Capital investments by Maker.  All four Pando principals have either led Venture-backed companies and/or been Venture Capital investors.  If Maker wishes to get into venture capital, we recommend that you create a corporation that can be a counterparty to the companies receiving that capital, and we recommend that you hire a very good lawyer and financial advisor to work through protective provisions for your equity and help you understand how Maker should be involved in governance and key decisions.  Our view is that VC is a challenge for true DeFi as it requires a very active investor \u2013 even for funds of funds.   Our understanding was that Maker is mostly interested in Investment Grade, rated assets as a first step into large scale renewable energy project finance.  That understanding is why we have presented a rated project from Mosaic to you.  These are stable cash flows that return your capital quicker than a similar Treasury bond.  If you\u2019re interested, we are able to increase the Debt Ceiling for this transaction by $200-300m relatively easily through our relationship with Mosaic.  This increase would allow us to lower our return and increase Maker\u2019s overall economics. However, we also are able to present unrated renewable energy projects to Maker, which can have increased risk-adjusted returns.  We could do this in addition to MIP73.  The structure would be somewhat different than what we presented here, but we can walk you through how that would work if interested. All of these projects would require a return for Pando, as we are a commercial enterprise.  So we thought we might ask you for some guidance/thoughts to help us see the path forward. Questions for the Forum:   We have noticed a few Maker commenters have mentioned that Maker would \u201close money\u201d on this MIP73 transaction.  We don\u2019t understand that comment and would appreciate better understanding that concern.  Aside from inflation, how do you believe Maker is losing money?  Obviously, inflation will make many investments a challenge - but less challenging than doing no investments.  Assuming the assets perform as contracted and based on our proposed terms, the cash return on Maker\u2019s $210 million would be $17.5 million.  Those returns would increase if we negotiate a different MIP73 revenue structure with Maker.   We have seen a request to increase the return to Maker in our MIP73 proposal.  Could you please let us know what yield you would be comfortable with given this structure, so that Pando can determine if we are able to meet that return and still run our business?  We are able to increase your yield and lower ours somewhat, but we will have substantial (and some yet unknown) costs for this transaction \u2013 so our ability to change the economics is doable, but we cannot undertake this transaction and provide Maker with 100% of the cash flows from Mosaic loans.  Increasing the debt ceiling could also allow us to lower our return, as we can spread the necessary costs across a larger pool of performing assets.   Thank you again, and we are enjoying this process and learning how Maker works.  Look forward to hearing more! ",

                    "content": "HI @flipflopflapdelegate Considering Climate Change in investment decisions is at the moment more about starting down a path than about finding the right long-term steady-state end-point - i.e. I hope most can agree that we can\u2019t reasonably let the planet go to pot and we know that the governments simply can\u2019t get there on their own - and certainly we cannot wait until all negative externalities are forced into pricing of assets to start doing something about it as investor. So how do you, as good global citizen investor, start down a path where you are positive force in the world in climate change terms? To me the key is to start from a first principle basis and focus on simplification and realism - and not listen to much to all the noise that exist in this area. I will list you here the main simple principles we came to in Monetalis just as an example. It has plenty of weaknesses, but to us was a reasonable pragmatic starting point:   Simple target: Decrease GHG emissions To cut through the clutter we simply choose that our goal, for now, going to be centered around climate change and helping decrease GHG emissions as a gross measure. It is by far the best described and understood part as far as I can tell - so that\u2019s were we start.   Profit with Purpose/double bottom-line A cardinal principle - we cannot sacrifice profit for postive societal impact. No venture can have sustained long-term success unless it delivers in-market profits. We just add the requirement or \u201csecond bottom line\u201d that says the company receiving credit must also perform on decreasing GHG emissions in their business/assets and measure it.   Exclusion List: Carbon economy As it says on the tin. Beyond the natural exclusions, we exclude business contributing to a growing carbon economy. This is the easiest place to start for a beginning climate change sensitive investors - excluding certain business purposes and assets.   Measurement simplificity & transparency Nothing gets done unless it is measured and reported. Reasonably simple to measure GHG emissions for most common assets and businesses with a limited set of direct data from the borrowers - as most of the hard work done by researchers.   Those sort of principles gets you on your way and you can improve over time. I would think this sort of initial principle implementation of the Clean Money vision should be quite supportable.

And we also want to be able to compare this proposed structure/pricing versus the last public Mosaic bond securitization deal that was done in early 2022. At least i am guessing this is the most relevant comparable transaction. Also could you please outline the proposed terms and structure of this loan? and details on the collateral pool backing the loan?   @Eumenes, Thank you. Please let me know if I\u2019ve misunderstood your questions in our replies below. One challenge in showing comparables is that private transactions do not typically publicize their terms, especially as this is not a bond purchase (rather it is a back-back loan). Additionally, most private transactions do not have rated assets. We\u2019ve tried to use the Mosaic public bond purchases as comparables - both for obvious reasons (these are the same assets) and because there isn\u2019t easy access to similar private transactions. Structure With regard to the structure, am I correct you\u2019re asking about legal structure? We\u2019ve briefly laid that out in c6 above, but below is more detail.  Happy to expand as needed. Mosaic to Pando:  Mosaic and a Pando SPV enter into a formal Loan Agreement, which will include all the parameters we reference in MIP73. Mosaic originates solar loans and puts them into a warehouse facility. Once that facility reaches a sufficient size of fully contracted loans, then that pool is transferred to a Mosaic-owned SPV. Once the loans are in the Mosaic SPV, SocGen works with Kroll to issue a private rating using the same methodologies Kroll uses for the public bonds. Only the loans from the Mosaic SPV that are together rated BBB+ will be packaged for our loan (i.e., some loans may not be eligible for our transaction). Those BBB+ rated loans will total approximately $210M and be ready for the Pando loan.  Maker to Pando:  Assuming Maker prefers that we use the Delaware (DE) Statutory Trust model, Pando will have helped Maker to create that Trust, and most likely an overseas Maker Trust. The Maker DE Trust entity and the Pando SPV enter into a formal Loan Agreement that mirrors the key terms of the Pando SPV-Mosaic Loan Agreement.  Customer payments flow from homeowners to the Collateral Agent, who then disperses funds according to the waterfall:  Principal and Interest are paid to Pando, who will have instructed the Collateral Agent to remit Maker\u2019s portion directly to Maker (through its trusts); Servicing and collateral fees are paid directly; and Any net cash is paid to Pando in accordance with its yield, and is subordinated to 1 & 2 above.  Collateral: Regarding collateral, Maker is lending against contracted cash flows from residential loans, for which all appropriate UCC filings will occur. The Pando SPV will pledge rights to the cash flows and security interests in the assets to the Maker Trust (via the Loan Agreement). The contracted cash flows will represent completed solar installations on 6,000-7,000 US residences, and the homeowners will have a weighted average FICO score of 700 or greater. We\u2019re using a market-standard structure for the loan agreements, and we believe we are consistent with the RWA sandbox document. But, for sure, we\u2019d enjoy discussing any items here in more detail or hear more from you. Yield: MIP73 is priced at virtually the same return as the early 2022 Mosaic transaction. Here is the breakdown of our proposed transaction: -Mosaic Yield: 2.9% (BBB+ pool of assets) -Maker Yield: [1.25]% (open to negotiation with Maker) -Remaining Yield: [1.65%] There are several one-time fees that Pando pays as part of the Transaction:  0.15% Structuring fee to SocGen [0.20]% fee to convert DAI to USD (not confirmed, but based on market feedback) 0.07% Kroll rating fee Fixed $ legal costs for both Pando & Maker (we cover Maker\u2019s costs). Our guess is around $500,000.  The remaining fees are ongoing and paid out of the Remaining Yield:  0.35% Serving Fee to Mosaic [.XX%] Collateral/Admin Agent for Mosaic (TBD)  The balance of the Remaining Yield stays with Pando. We have estimated this amount up to 1.2% based on yet-unknown DAI conversion and Collateral/Admin fees. Also, Pando\u2019s yield is subordinated to Maker\u2019s return. In typical project lending structures, the Sr. Lender (Maker) does not receive a higher yield than the subordinated entity (Pando). But, given how thin the overall yield is, we believe a higher yield to Pando is not justified. As a reminder, it is important to note that in the event Maker\u2019s interest payments are compromised from homeowner defaults, any unpaid interest will be accrued and paid from future cash flows (at the expense of Pando\u2019s yield). In other words, substantial, unforeseen homeowner defaults could delay, but will not erase Maker\u2019s return. Would you be the right person to discuss the yield arrangement between Maker and Pando? We would be glad to have that discussion at the appropriate time. If we have a call, we\u2019d propose posting meeting notes/summaries back to this thread so that the rest of the community stays up to date. Thank you again for the time you\u2019re spending on this MIP.  Best, -Peter ",

                    "content": "As this is a portfolio backed by Mosaic solar loans, it seems important to get disclosures on the the dealer fees paid directly to Mosaic that are embedded in these loans:  Dealers fees are fees payable by your solar installation company to the solar financing company, in this case, Mosaic to originate the loan. The reason they can get such cheap interest rates on such long-term loans is because Mosaic gets a chunk of the cost you pay for the solar system as an upfront origination fee. The reason why dealers fees matter to you is because your solar company builds that into the price of their systems. This is why it is better to be a cash buyer when it comes to solar. Hidden dealers fees on the solar loan are usually between 6% and 12% of the cost of the system.  Perhaps more concerning is that MakerDAO will be financing a loan pool with the following reputation, as described in the blog post linked above:  Unfortunately, there are many negative reviews for Mosaic Solar loans, ranging from people being signed up for Mosaic loans without knowing it, to getting liens placed on their property and unfairly high interest rates. Mosaic customers have also complained about poor experiences with the customer service department, and have even reported having trouble selling their homes while locked into a solar contract.  When MakerDAO backs this loan portfolio, it is implicitly endorsing this behavior. Is that something with which this community is comfortable? There are a lot of predatory finance deals in the clean energy space. I would ask this community to pay close attention to the credit situation and terms that were offered in deals that involve unsophisticated individuals. TradFi has proven, time and time again, that they are more than happy to engage in predatory deals without looking into the details (or to pretend they weren\u2019t aware of the moral concerns until the incriminating emails are released in court). One of the great things about DeFi is that we are able to discuss ethical concerns out in the open \u2013 let\u2019s do it. One last thing: it has been suggested in this discussion that MakerDAO\u2019s failure to complete this transaction would demonstrate an unwillingness to participate in green finance, which would make high quality borrowers hesitant to propose future deals. That\u2019s absolutely false. From what I have observed in finance, people usually take their best deals to the highest quality sources of capital before moving on to the suckers. By being highly selective and having a very thorough vetting process, MakerDAO is demonstrating a willingness to become the gold standard for RWA DeFi. The implications of that are huge, and go way beyond Maker\u2019s crypto origins. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the post, @numair.     numair:  As this is a portfolio backed by Mosaic solar loans, it seems important to get disclosures on the the dealer fees paid directly to Mosaic  that are embedded in these loans:   Dealer fees are how loan originators (like Mosaic) in all lending sectors earn some/all of their revenue.  It is not exclusive to Mosaic, and fees charged by lenders are universal.  Those fees always are baked into the price of the loan.  For example, Maker will have fees/costs (e.g., setting up legal entities like the DE Trust) on top of the yield that is your return, which the borrower (Pando) should pay and is a cost to the borrower.  If this MIP73 is approved, Pando would absorb those costs as part of the benefit of doing a transaction with Maker.  If you would like to discuss your concerns about these fees, we would be happy to discuss them specifically as they relate to Mosaic, as well as how they are standard across the industry. That said, the only way to avoid lender fees is for a homeowner to purchase the solar installation with cash - an expense that can be in the tens of thousands of dollars.  That option is chosen by some homeowners.  But, most homeowners do not have the luxury of purchasing solar installations with cash, and so options like loans, leases, subscriptions and PPAs have been created.  These financing options have dramatically expanded the amount of solar that has been deployed in the US and around the world. We believe this is where finance can have a profoundly positive impact; more homeowners have gone solar thanks to financing.     numair:  Unfortunately, there are many negative reviews for Mosaic Solar loans, ranging from people being signed up for Mosaic loans without knowing it, to getting liens placed on their property and unfairly high interest rates.   Regarding the reference in the article to customer reviews, lenders in all sectors file liens on the assets against which they are lending \u2013 it is the way a lender establishes its security interest in the asset so that a borrower can\u2019t get a different loan using the same asset as collateral.  I assume Maker would be concerned if Mosaic did NOT file a lien on the assets in the loan, as that would meaningfully impact Maker\u2019s protections as a lender. Regarding the comment about customers being signed up for loans without knowing it, Mosaic (and most of the other solar loan providers) do NOT engage directly with customers.  Mosaic and other lenders rely on installers to engage with customers. Some installers are large (like Tesla) but others are small.  Mosaic does have a large number of installers, and it has an installer vetting process in an attempt to reduce those poor customer experiences. Mosaic has teams dedicated to preventing fraud and trying to protect the borrower (because ultimately that is aligned with Mosaic\u2019s financial interest). For example, Mosaic calls every borrower as part of onboarding to ensure they understand what they are signing up for.  Pando has reviewed the installer vetting process and feels comfortable that it is consistent with the industry\u2019s best practices. That Mosaic has transacted $7b in loans over the past 8 years, it is not surprising that they have had complaints. Negative reviews for large businesses at scale are unavoidable.  However, according to the US-based Better Business Bureau, Mosaic has an A+ customer satisfaction rating, which is the highest possible rating. In our view this BBB rating, Mosaic\u2019s high credit rating, and Mosaic\u2019s general risk mitigation practices place them very far from a predatory lender. https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/oakland/profile/financial-services/mosaic-inc-1116-444414 Regarding the comment about demonstrating that Maker is able to transact in this space, the Mosaic article you reference reinforces the point Pando was making.  It says: \u201cBecause solar energy is still considered a newer technology, some conventional financial institutions don\u2019t eagerly seek out consumers in this loan sector. You will find that a specialized solar loan provider like Mosaic will likely be prepared to answer all your questions regarding solar loan products.\u201d  Because energy finance loans are not a common market for most lenders, borrowers do seek out those who have demonstrated an ability to transact in this space.  That is not a controversial statement. We absolutely do NOT believe that a failure to do this MIP73 transaction would demonstrate Maker\u2019s unwillingness to participate in this space.  What we do believe is that doing this relatively uncomplicated transaction would put Maker immediately in the same category as the leading lenders in this space and be the beginning of a variety of climate asset deals that are both profitable and good for the planet.  Indeed, the Pando team feels that the Maker vetting process to-date has been thorough, and we appreciate the conversation so far and getting some more insight into what the community is looking for.  I hope that helps clarify any misunderstanding, but again would be happy to expand further if I have failed to explain it better. ",

                    "content": "    Peter_Pando:  Yield: MIP73 is priced at virtually the same return as the early 2022 Mosaic transaction. Here is the breakdown of our proposed transaction: -Mosaic Yield: 2.9% (BBB+ pool of assets) -Maker Yield: [1.25]% (open to negotiation with Maker) -Remaining Yield: [1.65%]   Hi Peter - thanks for your replies. Can you please provide color on several key issues? 1)  You note that \u2026\"[your transaction] MIP73 is priced at virtually the same return as the early 2022 Mosaic transaction\u2026\"  This does not appear to be the case:  I have summarized the pricing for the 2022 Mosaic transaction below where the senior bonds are priced quite higher (2.81%) than the 1.25% yield you are offering Maker.  Given that you are offering Maker a BBB+ rated tranche, it will be quite similar to putting the 2022 Class A and Class B bonds into one senior bond.  Note that the coupon (weighted average coupon) on this blended Class A/B bond was 2.81% which is significantly above the 1.25% yield offered.  Can you please confirm my calculations or correct as needed?  image1072\u00d7228 42.5 KB  2.  Your MIP quotes the following terms/rates below.  Your calculations appear to show that all of the Mosaic Loan Rate are used in the transaction so the resulting net spread (after all variables expenses) is zero.  I have put your implied calculations in blue below and a more typical market structure calculations in green.  In a typical transaction the Maker Rate would only apply to Maker\u2019s portion of the capital structure (~80%) and the Pando Rate would only apply to its portion of the capital structure (~20%) where you appear to be assuming both the Maker Loan and the Pando Loan are both 100% which would be quite unusual and confusing.  In my Typical Notional (in green) there is about 1.21% spread that isnt being used.   This is a big difference:  could you please clarify? Summary Terms*:  Principal Amount: $210,000,000 Mosaic Int. Rate: 2.9% Maker Int. Rate: 1.25% 3rd Party Fees and Costs: 0.45% Pando Net Return: 1.2% Final Maturity: 2034   image975\u00d7204 18.2 KB  3.  You write that \u201c\u2026Once the loans are in the Mosaic SPV, SocGen works with Kroll to issue a private rating using the same methodologies Kroll uses for the public bonds. Only the loans from the Mosaic SPV that are together rated BBB+ will be packaged for our loan (i.e., some loans may not be eligible for our transaction). Those BBB+ rated loans will total approximately $210M and be ready for the Pando loan\u2026\u201d Typically a rating agency will only rate the bond tranches backed by a pool of consumer assets such as solar panel loans.  You appear to say that Kroll will rate all the consumer loans themselves and Pando will only take consumer loans rated BBB+ or higher.  This would be highly unusual - could you please confirm this? Thanks, ERic ",

                    "content": "As this is a self-contained MIP, the incubating LTS is providing as comprehensive questions/observations as possible given that the scope and timing of review and engagement post-approval is unclear. Given that uncertainty, a self-contained MIP should, in theory, include drafts of all of the agreements. Draft agreements will provide a holistic view of the transaction. Drafts will enable a more comprehensive and detailed legal review, expedite a complete legal risk assessment, and most importantly, enable Maker token holders to make a fully informed decision. The incubating LTS expects that Pando will engage experienced structured finance counsel and financial advisors in the structuring and transaction process. Neither incubating LTS nor @Real-World-Finance can be expected to act as Pando\u2019s indirect legal and structured finance advisors. Can Pando confirm whether it will pay for external counsel to be engaged by Maker or North Lakes Legal (in support of Maker). The incubating Legal and Transactional Services core unit is pleased to provide the following questions/observations to this self-contained MIP73.     Dori:  KBRA analyzes the Transaction\u2019s data and the underlying collateral pool and analyzes the capital structure using stressed cash flow assumptions. Pando and its legal counsel also will review operative agreements and legal opinions prior to closing.    If the tranches (pool of underlying loans) will be investment grade (as rated by KBRA), how do Pando\u2019s underwriting guidelines further support the KBRA analysis? Is Pando reconfirming the analysis of KBRA or doing something different?      Dori:  If this MIP is approved, the collateral onboarding is immediately moved to step 5 of the Collateral Onboarding Process Overview of the Collateral Onboarding Process - Collateral Onboarding      What pre-steps has Pando undertaken to date to allow the domain teams to undertake a prompt review of the transaction documents and publication of risk assessments (as contemplated by Step 5)?   Does Pando have a timeline for Pando to provide fully developed, balanced drafts of transaction documents and for the domain teams to complete their review of the transaction documents and publish risk assessments? If Pando does not have transaction documents ready to share, then the time required for Pando to prepare those documents with its counsel and advisors will potentially delay work on other transactions.   Is there a data room ready to be opened?   Any proposed prioritization should be supported by a detailed schedule and work breakdown. This is consistent with @MakerMan\u2019s comment:       MakerMan:  Reasonable Time frames for actionable activities and communications yes, prioritizations no.    Has Pando initiated discussions with a \u201cregulated crypto broker\u201d for purposes of the broker\u2019s diligence of the overall transaction. This tends to be a lead item.      Dori:  This proposal is based on the precedents set by the 6S Trust structure approved by the community in MIP13c3-SP4, as well MIP21, which has been active for more than half a year.    As I have noted elsewhere 6S Capital - Review of the Delaware Statutory Trust :    DSTs work well if implemented to enhance trustlessness and protect Maker\u2019s interests in the underlying transactions   DSTs work well when non-interested, independent and experienced third parties have express contractual or legal duties to protect the interests of the investors and ultimate beneficiaries (i.e., Maker)   \u201cTrustless\u201d implementation means that the borrower should not directly or indirectly direct the trustee on any actions. The structure should be designed to be effective in mitigating the risk of borrowers with bad intentions       MakerMan:  Last time I heard anything about 6s from RWF was that the recommended DC was 0 due to issues with existing legal structure. Which if I am correct means the same structure makes this MIP73 unsuitable from a legal structure standpoint.    I believe that the above may be responsive to @MakerMan\u2019s question.      Dori:  A high level summary of the transaction is below     Why does Pando need to be the lender to Mosaic? The DST could be the direct lender to Mosaic and Pando could perform the proposed administrative roles described without being the \u201clender\u201d itself. This appears to interject Pando SPV bankruptcy risk into the overall transaction structure.   Why is Pando (or the DST) not acquiring the loans through a true sale? The financial institutions currently engaged with Mosaic appear to be \u201cpurchasing\u201d the loans.       Dori:  Current loan purchasers are publicly traded financial institutions (e.g., BNP Paribas, New York Life, Royal Bank of Canada, TIAA, PIMCO, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, etc.)   The loan from Pando to Mosaic introduces Mosaic credit risk to the transaction. Please let me know if I have misunderstood how Pando \u201cacquires\u201d the loans.  Why does Pando SPV need to receive cash payments from the customers? This appears to interject Pando SPV bankruptcy risk into the overall transaction structure. This seems to be inconsistent with the statement:      Dori:  There must be no ability for funds to be misappropriated or get stuck.     What steps will be taken to minimize/eliminate Pando SPV bankruptcy risk?   If Customer payments are going to Pando SPV, presumably this means that Pando SPV will have a bank account to receive such payments. What controls exist in respect of such Pando bank account and will the DST have a security interest over such account?   Is there any reason Customer payments cannot be sent to an account held by the DST? We could establish a cash waterfall within the DST to ensure that Pando receives the agreed amounts.   Does Pando envision any collateral security in favor of the DST (equity interests in Pando SPV (for example))?   What does Pando envision to be the instrument evidencing the loan from the Maker vault to the Cayman entity?   Is the funds flow from the Cayman entity to the DST in the Cayman entity\u2019s capacity as \u201ctrust sponsor\u201d?   Pando to please provide some color on the tax treatment of payments from Pando through to the Cayman entity.   Thank you for the described role of the Maker trustee. A few clarifying questions with the principles (generally agreed to):  What is meant by:      Dori:  Ensures all capital flows are approved and accurate    The trust agreement will need to clearly and unambiguously provide that the Trustee\u2019s role is to undertake the role described below.      Dori:  The Maker Trustee confirms that the Transaction meets all requirements and that all Conditions Precedent (CPs) have been satisfied prior to execution.    As this is a self-contained MIP, has Pando given any consideration to the \u201cConditions Precedent\u201d (legal opinions, etc.)?      Dori:  The Maker Trustee also provides irrevocable instructions to Pando on whether and when to fund the Transaction.    Why are the instructions from the Maker trustee to Pando \u201cirrevocable\u201d? Does this mean that if there is a default between the time the instruction is given and the time Pando obtains the Mosaic loan that the Trustee cannot revoke the instruction?      Dori:  Exact entity structure (e.g., Trust, or Foundation, etc.) will be confirmed and established in conversation with the Maker Real World Assets Team    What is Pando\u2019s preference in terms of legal entity? This is something that Pando should propose upfront.      Dori:   Serves as Administrative Agent and Lender to Mosaic Structures, approves, and manages the Transaction. Confirms all Conditions Precedent have been met prior to funding Mosaic loan. Manages the Servicer, oversees all loans, and remedies any issues.     For purposes of our due diligence, can Pando provide any of the agreements that evidence these activities? If yes, the agreements should be included in the transaction schedule described above.      Dori:  After this MIP has been approved, in order to allow the MIP73 collateral onboarding to occur as described in MIP73c8, the Real World Finance Facilitator and the \u201cin SES incubation\u201d Facilitator of Legal and Transactions Services must, through a public forum post, provide a Verification of the de facto implemented legal and approval structure\u2019s appropriateness for holding a large amount of real world asset collateral for Maker.    The Verification instruction is unclear. What does Pando intend for \u201cappropriateness\u201d? @Real-World-Finance previously published Methodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions as a benchmark. Would this methodology constitute \u201cappropriateness\u201d?      Dori:  Cash Reserves (pre-funded)    What is the source of the pre-funding of the cash reserves?      Dori:  If the reserve account is depleted and Mosaic\u2019s position is depleted, then Pando\u2019s Administrative Agent fees and junior cash flows will be used to service Maker debt.     I understand the priority that the DST has in the proposed cash waterfall. In the event that the Admin. Agent fees are used to repay the DST, will the Admin. Agent then work for free? Will Pando, as administrative agent, subordinate any claims in respect of future cash flows?   In the event of insufficient cash flows to pay the servicer or administrative agent, has Pando considered a mechanism by which the DST could, at that time, agree to make those payments in priority to payments to the DST? It will be important for the servicer and administrative agent to continue to perform its role.   What are Pando\u2019s administrative agent fees anticipated to be? This administrative fee should be reasonable for the services provided. Pando should not max out the administrative fee as a means to reduce the equity distribution to Pando. Sorry if I have missed it in the subsequent threads. Mosaic\u2019s servicing fee appears to be about 0.35% of the outstanding principal.   How frequently will the Pando and Mosaic fees be paid out? A meaningful accumulation of accrued and unpaid fees will further support the over-collateralization.   ",
