                    "content": "1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? Polygon Network 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. References MATIC is the ecosystem token of Polygon Network (previously Matic) - a 100% EVM compatible L2 scaling solution with current TVL of more than $6B and 350+ dapps deployed across DeFi, NFT, Gaming and DAO space. With the recent rebranding Polygon has now expanded in scope and vision and have transformed into Polygon with the aim of becoming an Ethereum scaling aggregator - thereby providing developers with L2 solutions in addition to the POS/Plasma chain (mainnet launched April 2020), zk and Optimistic Rollups and Validum chains (part of the roadmap - as seen on website). 3. Provide a brief history of the project. Matic team has been making valuable contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem for a long time, even before it\u2019s public surfacing as Matic Network. This includes working on implementations of Plasma MVP, developing the WalletConnect protocol and the Ethereum event notification engine Dagger. MATIC token has now been listed over 30 exchanges globally (most recently Coinbase), and is trading against more than 50 base pairs. In terms of market cap MATIC is valued at $1.63B and FDV of $3.26B. 24H trading volumes of >$250M make it one of top 30 traded coins across DEXs and CEXs\u2026 Polygon POS/Plasma hybrid chain is a production ready L2 scaling solution that is 100% EVM compatible, decentralized with 88 validators and battle-tested with 200+ dapps building on it. Average txn/day around 200k and 260k+ wallet addresses. These numbers are increasing at a faster rate than competitors owing to the NFT craze and DeFi initiatives launched by dapps on Polygon. You can check all the dapps building on Polygon here on awesomepolygon.com . 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.  Project - Website  Whitepaper - Papers - Polygon | Ethereum's Internet of Blockchains  Document portal - Official documentation  Matic Asset codebase - Github  Ethereum addresses - Etherscan   5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.  Audits - Quantstamp audits   6. Link to any active communities relating to your project.  Communities - Discord, Reddit, Official forum   7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? The MATIC token lies at the heart of the Polygon ecosystem with multiple use-cases. Primarily the MATIC token is used for paying gas fees on the Polygon network. It runs the ecosystem, supporting top Dapps. Additionally you can participate in the Proof-of-Stake consensus of the blockchain as a validator node and earn 12-14% APY in MATIC tokens. 8. Where does exchange for the asset occur? MATIC is one of top traded assets on all CEXs. On-chain pairs are most liquid on Uniswap and Bancor. P.S. MakerDAO would be one of the first platform on L1 to support MATIC tokens as collateral \u2192 attracting CEX liquidity into DeFi. The MakerDAO community would be supporting an Ethereum scaling solution and also providing MATIC holders an additional revenue source in the long run. Specifications Author is a community member of the Polygon ecosystem. I appreciate you taking the time to review. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. ",

                    "content": "@sourcex glad to hear this. What would be the amount of MATIC used to collateralize 100m DAI debt? One of the main inputs for defining debt ceilings on Risk side is to compare it with on-chain liquidity, because the liquidation system relies on it. Selling $10m of MATIC on layer 1 via 1inch leads to 14% slippage. I suppose large chunk of Matic liquidity is on Polygon, but measuring slippage on Quickswap doesn\u2019t yield astonishing results as well. Most of the volume happens on Binance and Coinbase, but we can\u2019t count too much on these volumes during a potentially large liquidation event. From this perspective you either need to assure better on-chain liquidity for MATIC or we need to increase LR sufficiently above proposed 175% for your proposed $100m exposure. This might though price off other users. We did risk assessment for MATIC and proposed $10m debt ceiling to start, but as shown here we are able to increase it only to about $20m range at 175% collateralization ratio. ",

You mention that DAI will be used to invest in the Ethereum ecosystem\u2013can we assume this is for seed investments in other protocols?

                    "content": "Polygon via MATIC fits my criteria as a larger TVL player that will mint significant DAI.   Given that they are a significant L2 player and their token is minted on L1 gives reasonable assurance of security.  MATIC is listed on a number of key CEX\u2019s so trading and liquidity is robust. There is some concern that the team is predominantly from India where the government has not show a positive approach to crypto but even if India were to kill crypto use it probably would not hurt Polygon that much.  Though it could impair teams from getting payments legally.   I don\u2019t see this as a major impediment. If MATIC is willing to deposit something like 300-400M of MATIC to borrow 100M of DAI at, at least 3% SF (might want to run this one a touch higher at like 4%) and have a decently high LR (at least 150) I would support giving them a DC of $100M.   Realize the vast majority of this would probably end up on Polygon network to support borrowing there.    I believe this would be good for both Maker and Polygon and simply requires some decent management. Biggest issue here is going to be having parties ready to buy if this massive vault were to come under the liquidation gun so I really would like to hear from the Polygon team about how they are going to stagger liquidation prices.    I personally would like to see them use multiple vaults with different CRs so this simply can\u2019t happen or at least have something in place for automated CR management.   I mean the team clearly has the collateral to toss to avoid liquidation I just want to try to make sure this is solidly in place because I don\u2019t think the liquidation system could handle a single chunk of 100M very effectively in a dropping market situation.   Particularly if everything is dropping (ETH, wBTC, with MATIC and the rest simultaneously). Regarding using this DAI to invest in Ethereum Ecosystem.  My expectation is that it is a portfolio diversification and investment strategy to basically grow the PolygonDAOnetwork into a family of DAO\u2019s and products and reduce exposure to MATIC price by taking on cash at what is a pretty cheap rate 3%.  Polygon could take this DAI and plow 35-45% into COMPOUND and lever it to earn 10-11% to cover the entire 3% SF on the rest.    Really a shrew\u2019d play to borrow cheap and loan to pocket the interest rate spread.   Bonus is it gives them cash to manage token price so it is my hope that Polygon opens up a pretty sizable MATIC-DAI uniswap v2 type LP to start building price support via liquidity positions. I would be very supportive of a Uniswap MATIC-DAI v2 LP vault on Maker btw as this would fit perfectly with my DeepLiquidity thesis regarding community value building and it would bring more DAI online faster than LR changes or RWA.   Sure 100M isn\u2019t that much but it is a good step and better toward MATIC vault DC in the 200-500M range which at 3% would be 6-15M DAI revenues/yr. ",
