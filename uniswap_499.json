Since hodling UNI in our personal wallet doesn\u2019t gets hodlers a chance of passive income but only gets value appreciation overtime which is for me it takes time before someone able to see and appreciate their rewards for holding UNI in regard to its price increased. This is just my simple opinion. Thanks and more power to UNI and the brilliant people behind UNISWAP project. ",
