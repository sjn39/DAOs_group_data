Paragraph Summary MIP101 adds the Maker Constitution which provides the necessary foundation for the Scope Frameworks and the Endgame Plan. It should be considered along with the Scope Framework MIPs which put the Maker Constitution into practice.  Component Summary MIP101c1: Preamble The Preamble to the Maker Constitution. MIP101c2: Constitutional Articles  1: The purpose and values of MakerDAO 2: Dai Stablecoin Stability, Decentralization, and Risk 3: The Easy Governance Frontend (EGF) 4: Constitutional Conservers 5: Constitutional Voter Committees (CVCs) 6: Constitutional Delegates (CDs) 7: Professional Actors 8: Pregame SubDAO Communities 9: Scope Frameworks 10: List of Scope Framework Constutional Boundaries 11: Maker Constitution Amendment Process   Motivation The Maker Constitution provides the necessary foundation for the Scope Frameworks and the Endgame Plan. Further information on the motivation behind the Constitution may be found in MIP101c1.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP101c1: Preamble With the Maker Constitution, Maker Governance recognizes that the fundamental value and strength of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and decentralized finance is the ability to survive events and adversaries that would break the security of centralized systems. This has been demonstrated by technology such as Bitcoin and Ethereum which so far has proven impossible to shut down or censor. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, the Maker Protocol requires the support of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that operates based on direct vote by token holders. This means it relies on governance decisions by humans and institutions holding MKR tokens. Just like a smart contract can have vulnerabilities, this reliance on human input can expose weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can result in the failure of the Maker Protocol or the loss of user funds. The Maker Constitution is a strategic tool for building as much resilience as possible into the political and operational interactions and processes that occur in Maker Governance. It is based on the same adversarial mindset that governs the design of decentralized cryptographic protocols. The most well-understood form of governance-political vulnerability that exists in a DAO like Maker are full-scale governance attacks, such as a governance takeover or the theft of all Dai collateral. These risks are real and as a result resilience must be the first principle that all aspects of the system is designed around. It is just as important to consider the slow moving, slippery slope governance risks, such as cultural shift, creeping misalignment or a structural inability to achieve results. These governance risks are much more likely to materialize spontaneously, and can even pave the way for full-scale governance attacks. Budgets and decision-making around the allocation of resources, as well as control over governance privileges and prestige, are the most vulnerable parts of a DAO, as they intersect with very direct incentives of the actors involved in the governance process. Over the long term it has to be assumed that there could be attempts to exploit resource allocation by adversarial actors, or that resources will simply be wasted unintentionally. Robust grassroots community participation, by people who participate in alignment with the purpose of the DAO, is the essential tool to defend the protocol against these risks. The reason that alignment with a greater purpose beyond just financial return is so important is that indifferent, misaligned participants who are motivated to take part in Maker Governance purely for the sake of financial returns, while aligned in some areas of economic gain, will have nothing stopping them from exploiting opportunities to extract value for themselves even if it comes at a cost to the broader community. Alignment engineering is the practice of designing mechanisms, incentives and shared habits that benefit the organizational alignment of the entire ecosystem. It is used in all organizations, but its careful use is especially important in DAOs because their decentralized nature means that the more misalignment exists, the more difficult it becomes to implement new alignment engineering measures. The alignment engineering measures of the Maker Constitution must enforce, using specific and clear incentives and penalties, a self-sustaining equilibrium where MKR token holders can reasonably govern the DAO using a set of tools that allow Maker to grow and adapt while relying on a minimal amount of organizational alignment. At the same time the Maker Constitution must fundamentally ensure measures that permanently reinforce a healthy growth of community alignment, by using the Maker Constitution to lock in the core commitments of the Dai Stablecoin and a public good purpose of the project that goes beyond simple financial gain. The Maker Constitution requires clear definitions and delineations of all roles operating within the governance framework, and must strictly enforce separation of concerns. Any deliberate act that worsens conflict of interest, commingling of interest, consolidation of power or responsibility, or any other action that risks taking the DAO towards the slippery slope of governance failure is considered gross misalignment, and action must be taken to discourage such behaviour as a matter of survival. The Maker Constitution specifies a maximally unchangeable scope of Maker Governance to the extent it is reasonable. This helps ensure transparency and reduce complexity asymmetry because the core processes and frameworks change minimally, enabling token holders to follow along. In all cases where it is possible, complexity, responsibility, decision-making authority and risk is pushed to the edges of the Maker Ecosystem, ensuring the core governance processes remain as simple as possible over time, reducing risk and preventing scope and mission creep. To counterbalance the rigidity and constraint that results from the immutability inherent to the design of the Maker Constitution it implements a system for incubating and launching SubDAOs. SubDAOs are semi-independent DAOs that are linked to Maker Governance and whose core design enables a derisked, second layer of the ecosystem to foster fast-moving, unconstrained innovation, growth and experimentation. SubDAOs also enable delegation of responsibility and risk within specific, highly complex areas. In general, complexity, responsibility, decision-making authority and risk is off-loaded from Maker Core and pushed to the SubDAOs, except if the Maker Constitution specifies otherwise.  MIP101c2: Constitutional Articles  1: The purpose and values of MakerDAO  1.1: The purpose of the Dai Stablecoin The central purpose and value of MakerDAO, the Maker Protocol, the Dai Stablecoin and its community and ecosystem, is providing people access to an Unbiased World Currency in the form of the decentralized stablecoin Dai.   1.1.1: Maker Governance will never allow actions that move in the direction of being able to freeze, seize or force the transfer of regular Dai tokens held in normal user accounts or fully decentralized smart contracts, either on the Ethereum network or decentralized scaling networks.   1.2: Public Good Purpose To protect the long term integrity of its governance community, Maker will always share financial success with the world through charity that is distributed broadly and with thoughtful and genuine consideration of its impact. This permanent, guaranteed, direct action is necessary to lock in the core values of Maker and the Maker Constitution forever, even in the face of community misalignment, by ensuring aligned community members are always attracted to participate Maker Governance and are willing to volunteer to deal with misalignment issues.   1.2.1: To implement this in practice the Maker Constitution codifies a Purpose System that allocates token emissions to SubDAOs that use them on broad and diverse charitable causes chosen directly through community governance. The Purpose System is regulated through competition between the SubDAOs and checks and balances by the Ecosystem Scope Framework to ensure a lasting, verifiable and meaningful impact.     1.2.2: Before SubDAOs and the Purpose System is ready, and to immediately a set strong example of Makers Public Good purpose that will serve as a powerful alignment artifact the Maker Constitution creates the Public Good Fund. Maker Governance will, through the Public Good Fund, directly allocate a large amount of MKR from the Pause Proxy MKR reserves towards charity and public good campaigns that MKR holders deem aligned with the values of the community, and that no member of the Maker Community is profiting, benefitting or being compensated from. The Public Good Fund will be managed through the Ecosystem Scope. The initial MKR reserves allocated to the Public Good Fund is 20,000 MKR. The Public Good Fund is a temporary measure and will wind down and be fully replaced by the Purpose System by 2033 at the latest.   2: Dai Stablecoin Stability, Decentralization and Risk  2.1: The Dai Stablecoin and Synthetic Assets The core product of the Maker Protocol is to maintain the stability and usefulness of the Dai Stablecoin and other Syntethic Assets generated by the protocol.   2.1.1: The Dai Stablecoin must have predictable stability relative to a suitable reference asset, which can be a widely adopted world currency or a diversified basket representing the cost of goods or other relevant metrics of stability and utility as a currency.     2.1.2: Any change to the reference asset of Dai or another Synthetic Asset by the Maker Protocol must be done to protect the value of the users and be carried out in a way that minimizes harm and maximize stability and reliability for them.   2.2: Decentralization of the Dai Stablecoin Maker must aim to use decentralized collateral to back the value of Dai to the extent it is feasible to do so while ensuring Dai stability and utility, and always ensure a high level of preparation is in place to mitigate and absorb worst case scenarios, especially legal and political risk.  2.3: MKR Token Generation as Dai Backstop The Maker Protocol will by default generate new MKR tokens and dilute the MKR supply in the event that there is a shortfall of Dai collateral that makes it unable to back up the value of the reference asset. In case of unusual, serious losses where an attempt to cover the shortfall through the generation of MKR tokens would result in the MKR token becoming worthless and consequently forcing the Maker Protocol to shut down, it is possible for Maker Governance to reject an automatic MKR generation event, and instead impose a haircut on the value of Dai. Maker Governance will always strive to prevent a Dai haircut if it is possible to do so. This is both a commitment, but also a strong game theoretical incentive because market trust in the Dai Stablecoin will be permanently damaged if a haircut ever occurs.   2.3.1: Serious losses should only be possible due to real world risk, or due to governance mismanagement. By not committing to MKR dilution in scenarios where the MKR token would become worthless (\u201cdeath spiralling\u201d), it becomes possible for the Maker Protocol to safely use the MKR token as a decentralized collateral type. MKR as collateral without death spiral risk reduces exposure to Real World Asset risk while also acting as a voter incentive, reducing the likelihood of governance mismanagement.   3: The Easy Governance Frontend (EGF)  3.1: The Easy Governance Frontend (EGF) Definition The EGF is the standardized and regulated application that most users will use to access MKR voter incentives. It is the central community facing feature of the Maker Constitution and is critically important for the resilience of Maker Governance. It is designed to withstand attempts by individuals to manipulate the contents or design of the EGF in order to give them an advantage in the political dynamic of Maker Governance.  3.2: Design of the Easy Governance Frontend (EGF) The EGF must be simple and gamified in order to lower the barrier of meaningful contribution enough to enable MakerDAO to benefit from the wisdom of the crowd of all the incentivized voters that receive the MKR voter incentives, and are expected to have minimal alignment.  3.3: Delegation to Governance Strategies The user experience of the EGF reduces the central governance decision MKR holders have to make down to picking a Delegate and a Governance Strategy that the delegate must vote according to. This in line with how representative democracy works by having voters choose representatives from political parties that each represent a specific political agenda.  3.4: Importance of Immutability Because the design of the EGF has an outsized impact on the outcome of Maker Governance, the design must be near-immutable and rigorously defined to ensure all attempts at manipulation will be impossible.  4: Constitutional Conservers  4.1: Constitutional Conservers Definition Constitutional Conservers are external entities that play a fundamental role in facilitating and protecting the Maker Governance process by ensuring it occurs according to the processes defined in the Maker Constitution. As such, they enable MKR holders to participate in Maker Governance in a manner where it is easy for them to make the decisions that best benefit their long term interests as MKR holders, even if the MKR holders have relatively little alignment.  4.2: Roles of the Constitutional Conservers During the Pregame, the Constitutional Conservers are able to assume 2 critical governance roles: Constitutional Voter Committee Members and Constitutional Delegates.  4.3: Constitutional Conservers Eligibility Requirements To be eligible, Constitutional Conservers must publicly pledge their unbreakable support for preserving the Maker Constitution and to fight against, and make public, all forms of corruption, organizational drift and other constitutional threats that they discover from their embedded position near the inner workings of MakerDAO.   4.3.1: Constitutional Conservers may never collude or secretly organize to change the Maker Constitution or the governance dynamic of MakerDAO in general, except within the clearly delineated processes and frameworks of the Maker Constitution.   4.3.1.1: During the Pregame, the one exception to this rule is that Constitutional Voter Committe Members are allowed and encouraged to provide feedback and input on the overall direction and vision of the Final Maker Constitution.       4.3.2: Constitutional Conservers may only be operationally active in a single Constitutional Conserver role. They may not simultaneously assume multiple Constitutional Conserver roles, or other ecosystem roles such as Ecosystem Actors.     4.3.3: If a Constitutional Conserver is discovered to act against this pledge and the requirements outlined in 4.3 their Constitutional Conserver status is immediately derecognized. The processes for this are defined in the Arbitration Scope Framework.   4.3.3.1: In cases of mild \u201cslippery slope\u201d breaches, a warning may given and recorded in the Arbitration Scope Framework with no further consequence for the first breach.  4.3.3.2: In severe cases that can be described as Governance Attacks, in addition to being derecognized, the Constitutional Conserver is also stripped of all reputation under the reputation systems of the Ecosystem Scope Framework and the Physical Resilience Scope Framework.       4.3.4: When assuming the special roles available to Constitutional Conservers, they also become subject to additional requirements specific to their role. These role-specific requirements are described in the relevant Constitutional Articles and in the Arbitration Scope Framework. Breaking these requirements also means acting against the Constitutional Conserver pledge.   4.4: Constitutional Conserver Anonymity and Privacy Constitutional Conservers are encouraged to be anonymous. After the launch of the Endgame Maker Constitution, this will become a requirement.  5: Constitutional Voter Committees (CVCs)  5.1: Voter Committee Definition Voter Committees are groups of MKR holders that publicly coordinate to analyze the best voting behaviour based on a particular strategy, and publicly coordinate political positioning with other Voter Committees and voting blocs to reach compromises and middle grounds that minimize bad decisions. The base form of Voter Committees are the Permissionless Voter Committees which is a very simple designation for any kind of organized voting group.  5.2: Constitutional Voter Committee (CVC) Definition CVCs are standardized Voter Committees made up of Constitutional Conservers that participate above a minimum level in the Maker Governance process. They are subject to specific requirements, and receive various benefits, resources and support from the Ecosystem Scope.  5.3: Governance Strategy Position Documents The core task of CVCs is the consistent creation of Governance Strategy Position Documents for each of the 12 Scopes. The total collection of all latest Governance Strategy Position Documents of a CVC together form the up-to-date guidelines of the CVCs Governance Strategy, which Constitutional Delegates can follow in order to achieve Rank 1 and gain a favorable position in the EGFs.  5.4: Constitutional Voter Committee Recognition Process Permissionless Voter Committees can become recognized as CVCs by the Arbitration Scope if they fulfill the CVC eligibility requirements for participation and internal governance for at least one full quarterly governance cycle. If at any time after becoming recognized as a CVC, the CVC no longer completely fulfills all of the eligibility requirements, it immediately loses its recognition as a CVC.   5.4.1: A CVC must have at least one registered CVC Member that is a Constitutional Conserver and that has publicly verified ownership of MKR, based on the process for verifying MKR as specified in the Arbitration Scope.     5.4.2: A CVC must follow a standardized internal governance process for determining membership, creation of Governance Strategy Position Documents, and other decisions.   5.4.2.1: CVC Members vote on CVC decisions based on their relative ownership of verified MKR.  5.4.2.2: New CVC Members are included based on an application that is either accepted or rejected through a CVC decision.  5.4.2.3: Existing CVC Members can be removed through a CVC decision.  5.4.2.4: A minority quorum of CVC Members based on verified MKR can trigger a CVC split. The Arbitration Scope determines the minority quorum. All CVC Members then vote to support one of two new CVCs, with the naming rights and infrastructure inhereted by the side with more MKR in support. The CVC Members of each of the two new CVCs is determined based on who voted to support each side.   5.4.2.4.1: During the Pregame all Governance Strategy control also transfers fully to the side with more MKR \u2014 however this is not sustainable as it discourages the minority in an internal CVC dispute, and in the Endgame Maker Constitution must be changed to the voter strategy control splitting proportionally based on MKR amounts in support of each side.         5.4.3: A CVC must, through a CVC decision, create a legitimate Governance Strategy Scope Position Document for each of the 12 Scopes, each quarterly governance cycle. CVCs must also convene a CVC Subcomittee Meeting to discuss the creation of the Governance Strategy Scope Position Document for each of the 12 Scopes, each quarterly cycle.   5.5: Constitutional Voter Committee Support and Infrastructure A CVC receives support and infrastructure from the Ecosystem Scope in order to make it as easy as possible to create or participate in them. The most important is access communications platforms, including forums and chatroom, and support in arranging and operating CVC Subcommittee Meetings. The infrastructure must be continuously improved to be as reliable, decentralized and privacy-preserving as possible. If necessary the Ecosystem Scope must prioritize resources towards CVCs with more verified MKR and more Governance Strategy followers.  5.6: CVC Member participation rewards CVC Members that participate in a CVC can be eligible for CVC Member participation reward that recognizes the time they are spending to support Maker Governance.   5.6.1: The CVC Member participation compensation is paid out based on participation within each scope every quarter. To qualify for the participation reward for a particular Scope the CVC Member must both have attended the CVC Subcommittee Meeting and be co-author on the CVC Governance Strategy Position Document.     5.6.2: The yearly total CVC Member participation rewards is 500 MKR. This amount is broken into tranches of 10.41 MKR for each Scope per quarterly governance cycle, and shared across the reward slots for that Scope.     5.6.3: The MKR for the CVC Member participation rewards is taken from the protocol MKR reserve of the Pause Proxy.     5.6.4: During the Pregame the number of rewards slots for each tranche is 14. This gives a reward of 0.725 MKR for participation in each Scope per quarter for each CVC Member that obtain reward slots.     5.6.5: The reward slots of a tranche are awarded to the CVC Members that have fulfilled the participation requirements for the tranche and have the highest verified MKR balances.   5.7: Display of CVCs in EGFs CVCs are shown on a ranked list on the landing page of the EGFs, with name and byline displayed alongside their logo. The ranked list is determined based on highest total voter weight of the CVCs.   5.7.1: Total voter weight is calculated based on total undelegated or self-delegated, verified MKR holdings of members of the CVC plus total amount of MKR delegated to delegate strategies that follow the CVC   5.8: Constitutional Delegate (CD) interaction with Constitutional Voter Committee (CVC) Governance Strategies Constitutional Delegates can inherently choose to display themselves in the EGFs as following the Governance Strategy of a CVC. When they receive votes delegated through a Governance Strategy, they must by themselves execute the strategy faithfully through active voting. Having the CDs as the implementers of the strategies protects against centralization of power in the CVCs, but also gives CDs an opportunity for abuse if they don\u2019t follow the CVCs strategy faithfully.   5.8.1: To solve the problem CVCs have the ability to ban CDs from being displayed as following their strategy, through a CVC decision.     5.8.2: If a CD is banned by a CVC decision, the votes delegated for the CD to the strategy will instead count as a part of the delegates independent strategy.   6: Constitutional Delegates (CDs)  6.1: Delegates Definition Delegates are ecosystem actors that use smart contracts which allows regular MKR holders to safely delegate their MKR voting power without having to hand over the custody of the MKR itself. The Protocol Delegation System allows those who delegate with it to use MKR as collateral to generate Dai as a Voter Incentive. Delegates are not automatically displayed in the EGFs, but can interacted with through the EGFs if the user already knows the smart contract address of the delegate Protocol Delegation System smart contract.  6.2: Constitutional Delegates (CDs) Definition CDs are Constitutional Conservers that operate Protocol Delegation System smart contracts, and receive various benefits while being subject to specific requirements in addition to the Constitutional Conserver requirements.  6.3: Constitutional Delegate (CD) Income and Participation Requirements CDs are eligible to receive significant income from the Maker Protocol if they are among the top CDs based on total votes delegated to them, and they fulfill specific participation requirements. There are two income levels for CDs: Prime Constitutional Delegates (PCDs) that receive the highest level of income, and Reserve Constitutional Delegates (RCDs) that receive a lower level of income.   6.3.1: The top 7 qualified CDs by amount of delegated MKR are the PCDs. The top 8-14 qualified CDs by amount of delegated MKR are the RCDs. During the pregame, the ranks change in real time, and payouts to CDs is based on their income level at the moment the payouts occur. If a CD loses its qualification for CD income ranking, their slot goes to the next highest CD by amount of delegated MKR.     6.3.2: Each of the PCD and RCD slots can earn up to an equal share of the total compensation available to their level each month. The actual income that gets paid out is based on how well the CDs fulfill specific participation requirements     6.3.3: Actual CD income payouts are modified based on the requirement to have a minimum amount of participation in CVC Subcommittee Meetings. PCDs must participate in at least 16 CVC Subcommittee Meetings per month to qualify for their full share of CD income, and RCDs must participate in at least 4 CVC Subcommittee Meetings per month to qualify for their full share of CD income. If CDs participate in less than the minimum amount of CVC Subcommittee Meetings, accounted for on a weekly basis, they receive a proportionally reduced amount of the total CD income they are eligible for. If CDs participate in all the CVC Subcommittee Meetings of a month, they always receive the full amount of their CD income. Participation in CVC Subcommittee Meetings that the CDs are banned from does not count towards participation for the purposes of calculating CD income.     6.3.4: Actual CD income payouts are also modified by voting activity metrics for the last 12 months, which includes overall voting activity in all of the votes that the CDs are able to vote on. If a CD is active in less than 95% of all votes, they receive a reduced amount of CD income. The reduction in income is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 CD income at 75% voting activity. If a CD falls below 75% voting activity, it loses qualification for CD income and any CD income rank they may be eligible for is passed on to the next highest CD by amount of delegated MKR.     6.3.5: Actual CD income payouts are modified by CD communication metrics for the last 12 months, which requires the CDs to write an explanation for each vote that ties it to the Governance Strategy and their independent strategy, to help the MKR holders that delegated to them to understand the logic they use when executing the chosen Governance Strategies. If the CD actively communicates on less than 95% of all votes, they receive a reduced amount of CD income. The reduction in income is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 CD income at 75% communication activity. If a CD falls below 75% communication activity, it loses qualification for CD income and any CD income rank they may be eligible for is passed on to the next highest CD by amount of delegated MKR.     6.3.6: The 7 PCD slots share a total of 2000 MKR per year amongst them, equivalent to 285.7 MKR per year for each PCD, or 23.8 MKR per month for each PCD.     6.3.7: The 7 RCD slots share a total of 500 MKR per year amongst them, equivalent to 71.4 MKR per year for each RCD, or 5.95 MKR per month for each RCD.     6.3.8: The MKR for the CD income is taken from the Protocol MKR reserve of the Pause Proxy.     6.3.9: If the MKR price is below the level where PCDs receive CD income equivalent to an average full-time global upper management position, the Arbitration Scope can propose a Dai Stipend that supplements the MKR income to bring the CD income of PCDs to that level, in order to guarantee them with income security.   6.4: Default Display of Constitutional Delegates (CDs) in the Easy Governance Frontend (EGF) All CDs are displayed by default in the EGF, if they follow exactly 2 different CVC Governance Strategies. This is done by the CD having two separate Protocol Delegation System smart contracts, with each of them displaying the logo and byline of the CVC whose Governance Strategy it follows, while displaying the name of the CD. The total amount of MKR delegated to both Governance Strategies of the CD is counted for the purposes of calculating CD income level. If a CD is banned by a CVC, or the CD bans a CVC, the Arbitration Scope must ensure that MKR holders decide through a vote whether the CD is allowed to continue being displayed in the EGF with one of its Governance Strategies having transformed to an independent Governance Strategy.  6.5: Constitutional Delegate Alignment Risk Mitigation CDs are not allowed to engage directly with Ecosystem Actors and other counterparties to the DAO, or in other ways engage in operational activities. They must remain focused on providing governance information and research material to MKR holders, and acting as counterparties to the Facilitors. They are also not allowed to provide \u201ckickbacks\u201d from their compensation to MKR holders that delegate to them. Any violation of these requirements constitutes breaching the Constitutional Conserver pledge.  6.6: Constitutional Delegate Charity While CDs are not allowed to be involved in operational activities, or allocate their CD income towards operational activities, the one exception is using a portion of their CD income for donations to charity. It is encouraged that CDs compete and campaign on their ability to achieve some level of charitable impact with the resources available to them, in order to demonstrate alignment with the public good purpose of the DAO.  6.7: Constitutional Delegate Involvement in Budget Allocation During the Pregame, CDs can be involved directly in small scale budget allocation decisionmaking  6.8: Constitutional Delegate Banning of Constitutional Voter Committee CDs can ban CVCs if they determine that the CVC is making decisions contrary to the communicated vision, values, and byline of the CVC, and as a result is effectively disenfranchising voters who were misled as to what Governance Strategy they were delegating to. When a CD bans a CVC, it is equivalent to the CVC banning the CD, and the Governance Strategy of the CD, for the banned CVC, is transformed into an independent Governance Strategy, and the voters stop counting towards the total support of the CVC when determining its position in the EGF.  7: Professional Actors  7.1: Core Units during the Pregame Core Units continue to function using the MIP framework, with MIP39, MIP40 and MIP41 still active during the Pregame. Scope Framework MIPs can empower Core Units with additional budget and responsibilities. Project based funding mechanisms, such as Special Purpose Funds can be used to provide more granular funding for specific purposes to prevent waste or unaccounted work.  7.2: Incubation of Ecosystem Actors Ecosystem Actor Clusters are companies or groups of companies that aren\u2019t classified as Core Units, but receive funding from project-based funding mechanisms. Their purpose is to to build out crucial market infrastructure that will be necessary for the mechanisms of the Endgame Maker Constitution to work smoothly. This includes critical services for SubDAOs, and professional and expert services for Maker Core, or b2b services for other Ecosystem Actors. Generally, two types of Ecosystem Actors exist: Advisory Ecosystem Actors and Active Ecosystem Actors.   7.2.1: Advisory Ecosystem Actors are Ecosystem Actors that perform research and publish advice for the DAO to use in its governance process. Often, this is used as a check for choosing the best Active Ecosystem Actors available to supply a need defined in a Scope Framework. The work of Advisory Ecosystem Actors is implementing exclusively through modifications to the Scope Frameworks, and can also be used to receive advice regarding the specific interpretation of Scope Frameworks (which, if followed, must then be included in the Scope Framework).     7.2.3: Active Ecosystem Actors are Ecosystem Actors that work according to the specifications of Scope Frameworks to receive funding for performing specific projects such as developing new features, performing data collection or analysis, performing marketing, growth, outreach or educational activities, legal work, government outreach, and other operational activities that benefit the Maker Ecosystem.   8: Pregame SubDAO Communities  8.1: Pregame SubDAO Community Definition During the Pregame, MakerDAO will prepare the launch of 6 Launch SubDAOs to coincide with the activation of the Endgame Maker Constitution. These 6 SubDAOs will come in 3 forms: 2 FacilitatorDAOs (focused on managing governance operations of MakerDAO and other SubDAOs), 2 ProtectorDAOs (focused on interacting with real-world Assets on behalf of MakerDAO), and 2 CreatorDAOs (focused on decentralized innovation). Each of the 6 Launch SubDAOs will need well-developed Pregame SubDAO Communities, with enough community alignment to ensure the Launch SubDAOs have functional decentralized governance processes. These Pregame SubDAO Communities will be provided with infrastructure and support by the Ecosystem Scope.  8.2: Pregame SubDAO Community Communication Infrastructure The Pregame SubDAO Communities will initially have forum categories available for their use as a part of the larger Maker Ecosystem Forum that is maintained during the early stages of the Pregame by the Ecosystem Scope.  8.3: Pregame SubDAO Community Moderation Rights The Ecosystem Scope is responsible for moderating the communication channels of the Pregame SubDAO Communities. Additionally, as a part of the process of incubating independent Pregame SubDAO Communities, the Ecosystem Scope must seek to distribute moderator roles to proven active and aligned members of the Pregame SubDAO Communities. This must be done with the aim of fostering distinct communities that can keep members involved based on shared vision and values, and use moderation to ensure this core alignment isn\u2019t disrupted by unaligned actors.  9: Scope Frameworks  9.1: Scope Frameworks Explanation Scope Frameworks are modifiable subcomponents of the Maker Constitution that contain highly detailed and unambiguously defined rulesets, process definitions, instructions and incentives that together cover all practical aspects of each of the key focus areas necessary for MakerDAO to function as intended and maintain resilient scalability. Scope Frameworks and the Maker Constitution are built up of nested elements which act as the basic unit of instruction and are nested within each other in hierarchy of elements including: Articles, Sections, Clauses and Subclauses.  9.2: Scope Framework Coverage Together, the Scope Frameworks cover every aspect of Maker Governance operations and there exists no Maker Governance processes or rulesets outside the definitions of the Maker Constitution and the Scope Frameworks.  9.3: Scope Delineation Methodology The Scopes are delineated to cover focus areas of high-level importance that are considered crucial for MKR holders and the general MakerDAO community to understand and verify, to prevent crucial information or processes from occuring nested within layers of complexity, which could increase the risk of community misalignment by reducing transparency and scrutiny.  9.4: Modification of Scope Frameworks Scope Frameworks are modifiable within the constraints of Constitutional Boundaries that are immutably defined in the Maker Constitution.   9.4.1: Scope Framework changes must always move the Scope Framework further in the direction of decentralization, autonomous operation, future-proofing and resilience. It is not possible to reduce the level of automation implemented through a Scope Framework unless there is no other option available.   9.4.1.1: Example: It is not possible to replace a data-based algorithm that outputs a variable with a mechanism that has Maker Governance arbitrarily choose the algorithm, unless the algorithm turns out to be unworkable and no other similar replacement exists.       9.4.2: The long term aim is that the Scope Frameworks themselves will have gone through so many thoughtful iterations that they arrive at an end state where little to no change is ever needed again, and they ultimately end up as resilient, robust and reliable as the Maker Constitution.     9.4.3: Scope Framework changes must always reduce the complexity of rules and processes to the simplest reasonable level while also fulfilling the requirement for maximizing automation.   9.4.3.1: All elements of Scope Frameworks must routinely be examined to determine whether there is unreasonable levels of complexity that can be alleviated with modification that introduce simplification.       9.4.4: Scope Framework changes must always increase the clarity of all rules and processes with unambiguous language, interpretative notes on intent and reasoning, and as many examples as possible, as well as recording of settled precedents and analysis of the settled precedents.   9.4.4.1: All elements of Scope Frameworks must routinely be examined to determine whether there is limited clarity that can be alleviated with modifications that increase clarity, modifications that resolve contradictions, or with interpretative notes that provide additional context.     9.5: The 12 Scopes and Their Categorizations There are a total of 12 Scopes defined by the Maker Constitution, and they are categorized as Primary Scopes, Supporting Scopes and Governance Scopes.   9.5.1: The Primary Scopes.   9.5.1.1: Stability and Liquidity.  9.5.1.2: Decentralized Collateral.  9.5.1.3: Real-World Asset Collateral.  9.5.1.4: Ecosystem Operations.       9.5.2: The Supporting Scopes.   9.5.2.1: Protocol Engineering.  9.5.2.2: Growth.  9.5.2.3: Physical Resilience.  9.5.2.4: Interface.  9.5.2.5: Infrastructure.  9.5.2.6: Finance.       9.5.3: The Governance Scopes.   9.5.3.1: Arbitration.  9.5.3.2: Governance Security.     9.6: Ossification of Scope Framework Elements Elements in Scope Frameworks within the Constitutional Boundaries cannot be freely changed by Maker Governance. A general ossification rule is applied which means that new changes must be congruent in magnitude with recent changes. This means that Elements that have not been changed for a very long time can only be modified slightly \u2014 however, if Elements have been continuously changed in recent times, they are considered not ossified and much more significant changes can be made to them within a single cycle.  9.7: Modifying the Content and Structure of Scope Frameworks The description of each Scope Framework in the Maker Constitution outlines the general principles of the Scope, and details specific content that the Scope Frameworks must cover with elements. The general principles of the Scope and the required elements of the constitutional boundaries sections provide indirect guidance on adding additional content that are relevant to cover for the Scope Framework to function optimally as intended, as long as they fit completely within the principles of the Scope and cover a gap of functionality that is missing when considering the context. Each Scope Framework will typically be organized with an Article covering each of the sets of elements described in the list in 10, but Maker Governance may choose to change the structure of Articles and elements in the Scope Framework, as long as the content of the required sets of elements are fully covered.  9.8: Soft Scope Framework Elements Subclauses (denoted x.x.x.x) and lower elements can be specified to be Soft Elements. Soft Elements differ from normal Scope Framework Elements in that they are not expected to harden and ossify over time, but rather always be changed, and that the process for changing them is different from the standard quarterly governance cycle based on CVC Scope Framework Position Papers. Soft Elements may also contain advanced content, including media content or interactive programs.  10: List of Scope Framework Constutional Boundaries  10.1: Constitutional Boundaries of the Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework The Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework provides the core principles, rules and regulation regarding Dai stability, peg, and the liquidity and minimum returns of collateral.

Maker Governance is then able to add additional farmable tokens over time, making the first version of the Sagittarius Engine compatible with the SubDAO token launch.  10.5.4.4: The user must be able to complete the actions of depositing MKR to the Sagittarius Engine, delegating MKR through it, specifying and initiating token farming using at most 2 transactions.  10.5.4.5: The user is able to generate Dai with the MKR as collateral, as in a normal Maker Core Vault if the users MKR deposit is successful and the MKR is successfully delegated through the module.  10.5.4.6: The oracle for the MKR prices of Sagittarius Engine Vaults has constrained upwards movement, enabling Maker Governance to throttle the speed at which its reported price increases, regardless of how fast the price is actually increasing. This constraint does not apply to downwards price movement.  10.5.4.7: If the users Sagittarius Engine Vault is liquidated, the Collateral Adapter automatically ends the token farming and undelegates the MKR, and puts the MKR up for an auction.  10.5.4.8: If the user wishes to pull out their MKR after paying down their Vault Debt, the MKR is automatically undelegated, the token farming ends and the MKR is returned to the users wallet.       10.5.5: A set of elements covering The Simple Dai Farm optional, interim Product Specification. These elements covers the decision and deployment an optional, interim feature that can be used to provide an ERC-20 farming voter incentive with Dai from the Surplus Buffer to attract more users to the Sagittarius Engine for testing. The following content, and all necessary related content, must be covered:   10.5.5.1: The conditions and process that triggers resources to be deprioritized elsewhere and allocated towards development and deployment of the Simple Dai Farm. This includes lack of Sagittarius Engine users and lack of EGF testing data, and requires analysis of the risk of pushing back the SubDAO launch to later than Q2 2024.  10.5.5.2: The Product Specification must contain a mechanism for allocating a continuous rate of Dai funneled from the Surplus Buffer to the Sagittarius Engine, where it is made available for farming by MKR depositors. The total rate of Dai is determined by Maker Governance Vote and is specified as a fixed amount of Dai per time unit.  10.5.5.3: The process for dismantling and cleaning up the interim feature after the SubDAO tokens have launched and the Simple Dai Farm has become obsolete.     10.6: Constitutional Boundaries of the Growth Scope Framework  Marketing, public relations, education, and awareness campaigns.

Suggestion One of the early takeaways from the Endgame was the encouragement of ownership, autonomy, and the ability for the decentralized workforce to generate entrepreneurial energy via clusters, subDAOs, and EAs.

But I\u2019ll just re-iterate the comment I made on a previous draft (and to be fair I do think you\u2019ve tried to take this into account): If this is meant to be a constitution in line with historical documents (specifically the American constitution), it should not contain reasoning, it should only contain legislation / rules (with the exception of the preamble.) Removing all this will immediately reduce the length, and should focus discussion around the specifics of wording and what should and should not be included. I would actually recommend creating two documents. The constitution, and a \u2018constitutional commentary\u2019 which share the same structure in terms of headings/articles/etc, but clearly separate the \u2018these are the rules\u2019 from the \u2018this is what the rules intend to achieve and why that\u2019s important\u2019. If the documents do share the same structure, it\u2019s quite possible that in the future we can build a front-end that displays them side-by-side. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big job, someone could probably implement it in couple of days work.  On a more general level, this is the main issue with the MIPs framework in its current iteration. It requires the author to write a document for two audiences:  Audience A is the audience you want to vote for the proposal, so it needs to convince. Audience B is the DAO if the proposal is accepted, and needs to be able to easily understand and implement the contents.  The result is the inclusion of persuasion in a \u2018body of law\u2019 which should be purely declarative. ",

The main thing im struggling with is that I think it is important that the intent and reasoning is contained with the constitution MIP so it is not an external document that is more likely to be changeable. The role of a continuously changing interpretation of the Constitution will also be the first article of the Arbitration Scope Framework. But I think there is a lot of value in also having in the constitution itself immutable reasoning and examples acting as an indirect \u201cecho of the spirit\u201d to the greatest extent possible, with as much detail as possible that we feel safe to include once we get close to the launch of the SubDAOs and the Constitution becomes immutable. This would then heavily help constrain the creative possibilities of what can be with interpretations in the Arbitration Scope. Also agree the most straightforward is to move all reasoning to the preamble. The downside is that you can\u2019t compare it side by side so you need to sort of read through the document two times. Perhaps it could even be broken into two preambles, the high flying abstract vision and the more step by step reasoning that maps 1:1 with the actual constitutional elements. The other option could be to create a special style of content in elements that denotes it is acting as a sort of interpretative note, and is attached as a subelement to each constitutional element. This is how it is meant to work in the Scope Frameworks, but they are also meant to be giant living documents that can only be easily read using special software like the DAO toolkit, while the Constitution ideally can be read just as a long normal piece of text. So this could look something like:  6.8: Constitutional Delegate banning of Constitutional Voter Committee CDs can ban CVCs through a public statement signed with their verified Ethereum address. When a CD bans a CVC, it is equivalent to the CVC banning the CD, and the Governance Strategy of the CD, for the banned CVC, is transformed into an independent Governance Strategy. Consequently, the voters of the Governance Strategy stops counting towards the total support of the CVC when determining its position in the EGF.   6.8.0: Interpretive note: This action is meant to be taken if the CD determines that the CVC is making decisions contrary to the communicated vision, values and byline of the CVC, and as a result is effectively disenfranchising voters who were misled as to what Governance Strategy they were delegating to.   Not sure what people think of the above formatting, which could then be applied to almost every element in the constitution with a italicized subelement note like this that\u2019s always the 0th subelement, if it occurs. The last option would be to add the interpretations at the end as kind of footnote that is linked from the elements, and then with some software such as the DAO toolkit they could easily be overlaid or shown alongside the elements, but wouldn\u2019t be contained right in the document for a reader that is just trying to understand the actual specific rules.

Yeah, I\u2019d be on board with that. Alternatively, while I think the \u2018interpretive note\u2019 formatting is a little more clunky, perhaps you just set the general rule that italicized text is non-binding reasoning and standard text binding declarative? That way you could avoid adding separate subheadings. Ultimately though, you could also just have a brief statement saying \u2018the companion document to this constitution containing commentary and reasoning is bound by the same rules of modification as this constitution\u2019 which would allow you to separate the two, while still ensuring the reasoning and commentary has the same level of mutability as the declarative constitution.     rune:  The main thing im struggling with is that I think it is important that the intent and reasoning is contained with the constitution   On a general note.

Careless and ambiguous statements are easier to make in these sorts of intent-and-reasoning parts.

This guaranteed, direct action is necessary to lock in the core values of MakerDAO and the Maker Constitution even in the face of community misalignment.   1.2.1: To implement this in practice the Maker Constitution codifies a Purpose System that allocates token emissions to charitable causes, regulated through competition and checks and balances to ensure a lasting, verifiable and meaningful impact.  1.3: Scientific Sustainability   I\u2019d like to see these concepts addressed in the Scopes rather than embedded as immutable Constitutional aspects of the protocol. The basic mission of MakerDAO already testifies toward the project itself being a force for the public good. What could be more charitable than to open access to finance for all the world? If it does not maximize overall net returns by having a highly sustainable free-market business focus, MakerDAO cannot for long be of much good to anyone. On a personal note: I care quite a lot about the world and find that by focusing in my work on fixing the money problem, I am unlocking the ultimate solution for all the things. It\u2019s the best of both worlds. Niche personal interests and social good missions I find more meaningful to address privately and separately from things that need to earn their keep. MakerDAO is truly a favorite place for its LACK of explicit focus on all the social and science arguments happening everywhere else. In any case, surely 100% of the resources and efforts will need 110% focus on the narrow money mission for MakerDAO to succeed at this ambitious goal:     rune:  providing people access to an Unbiased World Currency in the form of the decentralized stablecoin Dai.   Further to the GOOD that MakerDAO is doing just by being purely Maker, I\u2019d like to recommend this great essay, The Valley of Death by Neal Spackman. Neal is Founder of Regenerative Resources Co., an Ecosystems Services company. They:  *acquire highly-degraded land, either by purchase, long-term lease, or in partnership with landholders (governments, tribes, private owners) *transform that land, whether into restored ecosystems or agroecologies. *commercialize the outputs of that transformation.  The Real World Asset Scope could specify an intention to address the dearth of financing available to regenerative projects that need to incur high capital expenses BEFORE they can become even remotely financeable by traditional sources of financing and even sources of venture philanthropy. MakerDAO could designate a portion of approvals to subsidize with internally designated funds, or make a huge impact just by virtue of having underwriting standards that recognize and accept the unique risks in these types of projects. From Neal\u2019s article:  First, there is immense interest from the financial world in nature-based solutions to climate change, in blue carbon in particular, and wide recognition of their potential to solve multiple issues. Second, there are numerous organizations dedicated to developing bioregionally appropriate land restoration & regeneration projects, from the oceans to the tops of watersheds. Third, despite points one and two, there is a dearth of deployed capital, and a plethora of projects not getting funded. Very few in the financial world understand the difficulties and requirements for getting these projects going, and almost none of the people in the project development world get finance. This was a point I emphasized in the podcast \u201cSolving Climate Naturally,\u201d and I\u2019m here to add some meat to those bones. The fact of the matter is, it\u2019s almost impossible to get a project funded, because of what\u2019s known as the Valley of Death.   1 nA3wyCmnNu0GejGPSMU2xg.jpeg956\u00d7620 33.4 KB  Indicative cash flow model of forestry projects. The numbers on the Y axis fractal \u2014 could be 10X as big or 10X as small \u2014 same curve applies. CONCLUSION I\u2019m suggesting there is a way to have a general BUSINESS focus to address the problems, rather than require the entire protocol to orient to specific causes via charity. For more on Neal\u2019s work, watch this incredible final update on YouTube from his Al Baydha Project where after 9 years in, a former desert became a lush ecosystem. Disclosure: I met Neal through my work with the social ReFi community ACRE DAOs and have no business or professional involvement with his work. I\u2019m just a major fangirl and believe he represents the best of the best in the space!     ",

Bundling so much together is likely to end up causing a delay due to difficulty drafting details or disagreement over details. Given that this is meant to be modeled somewhat on the US Constitution, this also makes a lot of sense to go ahead and get the core constitution out the door, and then have a slew of amendments waiting to be individually debated and approved immediately after. The US Bill of Rights (Amendments 1 through 10) were originally a set of 20 amendments that were reduced to 17 by the House, then reduced again to 12 by the Senate. Two of those did not pass, as history shows, and had all 20 amendments been included in the original US Constitution, it seems doubtful that it would have been ratified. The sheer size of this document promises that at least several disagreements over wording or implementation or other details are likely to arise. Isolating pieces that do not directly inform the constitution (but rather, are themselves informed by the constitution, such as everything around defining scopes) would be one way to create a leaner document.

The integration does actually go to the merits of sustaining the whole. I like 1.2 Public Good purpose of MakerDAO here, but I think these words are limiting and don\u2019t capture the fullness of what it looks like to be an integral structural actor in the financial mechanisms of \u201cGood\u201d \u2026 of which \u201ccharity\u201d is only a small part. As written, the interest in good works comes across as an aside. Easily read as a kind of \u201ccorporate social responsibility\u201d side show or silky virtue signal. However, I see the aim is really based on very sound empirics that these values are NECESSARY for anything and everything to work. Query whether there should be more explicit language that ties the Purpose System to the subDAO tokenomics, or otherwise make transparent that we are talking about an essential equilibrium required to reach and perpetually sustain the Endgame. Section 1.3 I would revise to remove the word \u201cScientific\u201d and specific discussion of energy solutions. A \u201cSustainability Fund\u201d opens the Constitution for greater agreement and participation. One could argue that any of income inequality or poverty or hunger will wipe out civilization much faster that ecological collapse.

Problems solved.     rune:  1.3: Scientific Sustainability Scientific Sustainability is a core principle of the Maker Constitution that recognizes the unique critical relationship between financial infrastructure and the global environmental risks of climate change. At the time of the Maker Constitution the world is headed off a cliff with runaway greenhouse gas pollution pushing the biosphere past critical climate tipping points that will cause disasters for centuries to come. Immediate action is required, and to support this effort, the Pregame Constitution allocates a large initial amount of its MKR reserves as well as initial MKR token emissions from the Purpose System to be allocated towards a Scientific Sustainability Fund.   1.3.1: The Scientific Sustainability Fund directs funding toward awareness campaigns for promoting, educating and combatting misinformation about energy solutions that have proven, real life track records of achieving scalable decarbonization, and that have low costs according to the Levelized Full System Costs of Electricity. The Scientific Sustainability Fund will be managed through the Ecosystem Scope. The initial MKR reserves allocated to the Scientific Sustainability Fund is 20,000 MKR. The Scientific Sustainability Fund is a temporary measure and will wind down and be fully replaced by the Purpose System in 2040.   1.3.1.1: The Maker Constitution prohibits the direct funding of coal energy, enforced through the Real World Asset Collateral Scope Framework.      I\u2019d leave mention of the prohibition on Coal and specifics of resource allocation and amounts in the appropriate Scopes. Remove it from the pregame Constitution.

It will be funded permanently and irrevocably with 2000 MKR per year, and 0.25% of the total SubDAO token supply of all Protector and Creator SubDAOs. Facilitator SubDAOs will be overseeing the 2000 MKR and its allocation to the winners of the Creators and Protectors in the Charity Competition that aims to gamify the whole experience, hence cannot participate themselves. But before we get there we have to have something in place, because there is going to be a lot of complexity need to fully build out the purpose system and the charity competition to avoid it descending into chaos. To codeknights point, we need something simple that gets the job done and doesn\u2019t distract us from all the work we have to accomplish. The answer is to deliver on the original clean money vision but simplifying it to funding the awareness of energy solutions that have 1) proven track record of large scale decarbonization 2) produce cheap electricity when all factors are considered, including storage and transmission. It allows us to vastly simplify our RWA process, which is already our most complex issue that tends to generate the most trouble in the community and bureaucracy. Then we are both having a huge impact with a set-and-forget solution, so we can focus all our efforts on making profits to ensure the sustainability of the early endgame with good conscience, and we have also not turned our backs on the original Clean Money vision. Not referencing Clean Money in the constitution was an obvious mistake that I will correct as soon as I have time. It is a part of the history and spirit of the constitution. And of course another final point of why we can\u2019t just wait, is that we are already having cultural inertia now, even with people who were here when clean money was supported by maker governance. Without a very clear proof of something actually being done people will quickly regress to short term profit maximizing, just like we\u2019ve seen in so many other ways on this project, as it is humans nature. It needs to be front and center, here and now so we have a higher chance of getting the impact we need on the culture, that\u2019s why it is also one of the first things in the constitution. ",

                    "content": " Remark 1: The need to reduce ambiguity as much as possible As an overall comment, I agree with points made above, particularly by LFW, that the constitution as drafted needs to be carefully scrutinised for ambiguous and particularly contradictory language given the fundamental role that the document will play for the whole Endgame (and Maker as a whole). It is clear that the document is intended to be a legal code or \u2018supreme\u2019 document: for instance, Constitutional Conservers will need to \u201cpublicly pledge their unbreakable support for preserving the Maker Constitution\u201d (4.3). It is easy to foresee disputes down the line where differing interpretations of the Constitution could lead to acrimonious splits in governance.     rune:  My thinking for where to practically define things such as when is something a hard rule, and when it is \u201csofter\u201d intent (delineated e.g. as normal text vs italics), and what does this mean in practice, is in the constitutional boundaries of the arbitration scope framework, since that is where the actual processes of making decisions based on these things will be contained and used to enforce the rules   This is a helpful step and there is plenty of precedent for this in the legal world: many international conventions and treaties use different kinds of language to denote different degrees of commitment. There are examples of this in the constitution already so more explicit differentiation could be a good idea, with greater use of language like this \"Maker must aim to use decentralized collateral to back the value of Dai to the extent it is feasible to do\" (2.2) (emphasis added) where flexibility is necessary. Another idea could be to make more use of the Constitution\u2019s preamble for these kinds of aims. Sometimes the Constitution uses firm language like \u201cmust\u201d in a way that still allows for very broad subjective interpretation - this is confusing, as it is not clear what explicitly is being required. For example:   \u201cAny change to the reference asset of Dai or another Synthetic Asset by the Maker Protocol must be done to protect the value of the users and be carried out in a way that minimizes harm and maximize stability and reliability for them\u201d (2.1.2): what does it mean to \u2018protect the value of users\u2019? I appreciate the intent here, but anyone proposing a change to DAI\u2019s peg could find a way of justifying  that the change would \u201cminimize harm\u201d, even if just by arguing that DAI should move away from the USD at any cost.   \u201cCDs are not allowed to engage directly with Ecosystem Actors and other counterparties to the DAO, or in other ways engage in operational activities.\u201d (6.5): this is another example of firm wording that could lead to serious issues down the road. At the moment, delegates are constantly in discussion with a whole range of actors involved with Maker - does this mean \u201cengage directly\u201d? What is \u201coperational\u201d exactly? Again, I can appreciate the intent behind this provision, but it\u2019s not as clear as it seems and the Constitution (necessarily) leaves empty the question of how the provision should be interpreted in a particular set of facts. That is a structural, but solvable, problem.    Remark 2: Some ambiguity is inevitable. How do we resolve future interpretative disputes? Do we need a Constitutional Court? The above example of a proposal to depeg from the USD is hypothetical of course, but the key question remains: who decides how the Constitution is interpreted on any given issue? This may not be a popular suggestion, but it\u2019s worth floating the idea: does Maker need a Constitutional Court? Consider: it is a historical inevitability that any constitution, even the most simple, will face interpretive challenges about how it should apply in a particular context. Something particularly complicated, like the Maker Constitution, will engender even more ambiguity - there is no way of drafting the constitution to avoid these interpretive questions. While CDs and CVCs have some capacity to resolve disputes between each other, no particular institution is vested with resolving interpretive questions with the Constitution, which is a different question entirely. I appreciate that the Arbitration Scope Framework will include some detail on principles and processes relating to constitutional interpretation, but historically a separate institution is usually needed to carry out the detailed (and crucial) work of resolving constitutional ambiguities as they arise. It is worth thinking through at this advance stage what entity should be entrusted with that core constitutional role. Given the importance of some of those designations (for instance, possibly resulting in the removal of a CD or CVC), I don\u2019t think either CDs or CVCs should be involved given their vested interests: there needs to be another independent body that can provide objective \u2018decisions\u2019 about how the constitution should be read. This is a path trodden by constitutional democracies around the world: most of them end up with a dedicated constitutional court with the legitimacy and expertise to answer those interpretive questions. It might be something for us to think about. ",

The arbitration scope exists to facilitate deliberated decisions regarding ambiguity or shortcomings in the constitution, and the core units and advisory council can to the extent possible play the role of supreme judges that control what kind of information and evidence is relevant and honest. But ultimately it is always up to MKR voters to make the final decision when something actually comes to a vote, since they have the physical control over the protocol. This is where the interconnected checks and balances of the CVCs and delegates becomes very important as it attempts to prevent the problems with delegates getting out of control. ",

                    "content": "    rune:  1.1: The purpose of the Dai Stablecoin The central purpose and value of MakerDAO, the Maker Protocol, the Dai Stablecoin and its community and ecosystem, is providing people access to an Unbiased World Currency in the form of the decentralized stablecoin Dai.   IMO section 1.1. is the most important part of the entire constitution. Because of that, a precise definition of an \u201cUnbiased World Currency\u201d and a \u201cdecentralized stablecoin\u201d is very important. As I understand it, the coining of the term goes way back in Maker, so I might not be the right person to define this. However, I would initially say an Unbiased World Currency means a stablecoin that is safe, stable, efficient and globally adopted.     rune:  1.2: Public Good Purpose To protect the long term integrity of its governance community, Maker will always share financial success with the world through charity that is distributed broadly and with thoughtful and genuine consideration of its impact, so long as doing so does not affect the long-term viability of MKR and Dai. This permanent, guaranteed, direct action is necessary to lock in the core values of Maker and the Maker Constitution forever, even in the face of community misalignment, by ensuring aligned community members are always attracted to participate Maker Governance and are willing to volunteer to deal with misalignment issues.   The suggested amendment to 1.2 is to cap these financial dispositions in order to preserve the  purpose in 1.1     rune:  1.3: Clean Money Clean Money is a core principle of the Maker Constitution that recognizes the unique critical relationship between financial infrastructure and the global environmental risks of climate change. To Support this effort, the Maker Constitution allocates a large initial amount of its MKR reserves as well as initial MKR token emissions from the Purpose System to be allocated towards a Clean Money Fund, so long as doing so does not affect the long-term viability of MKR and Dai. This helps Maker deliver on the promise of Clean Money, while also ensuring that significant public good commitment is active from the moment the Maker Constitution is approved. This helps lock in the core values of Maker by attracting the right people to participate in Maker Governance, reducing the risk of community misalignment early on.   Delete \u201cinitial\u201d, unless we have defined the follow-up allocation(s). \u201cInitial\u201d is used several times in this draft, and this comment applies to all cases. Capping the financial dispositions in order to preserve the purpose in 1.1     rune:  2.1: The Dai Stablecoin and Synthetic Assets The core product of the Maker Protocol is to maintain the stability and usefulness of the Dai Stablecoin and other Syntethic Assets generated by the protocol.   2.1.1: The Dai Stablecoin must have predictable stability relative to a suitable reference asset, which can be a widely adopted world currency or a diversified basket representing the cost of goods or other relevant metrics of stability and utility as a currency.  2.1.2: Any change to the reference asset of Dai or another Synthetic Asset by the Maker Protocol must be done to protect the value of the users and be carried out in a way that minimizes harm and maximize stability and reliability for them.  2.2: Decentralization of the Dai Stablecoin Maker must aim to use decentralized collateral to back the value of Dai to the extent it is feasible to do so while ensuring Dai stability and utility, and always ensure a high level of preparation is in place to mitigate and absorb worst case scenarios, especially legal and political risk. 2.3: MKR token generation as Dai backstop The Maker Protocol will by default generate new MKR tokens and dilute the MKR supply in the event that there is a shortfall of Dai collateral that makes it unable to back up the value of the reference asset. It is not a guaranteed commitment, which means that it is possible for Maker Governance to reject an automatic MKR generation event, and instead impose a haircut on the value of Dai. This option needs to be available in case of unusual, serious losses where an attempt to cover the shortfall through the generation of MKR tokens would result in the MKR token becoming worthless and consequently forcing the Maker Protocol to shut down. Maker Governance will always strive to prevent a Dai haircut if it is possible to do so. This is both a commitment, but also a strong game theoretical incentive because market trust in the Dai Stablecoin will be permanently damaged if a haircut ever occurs.   2.3.1: Serious losses should only be possible due to real world risk, or due to governance mismanagement. By not committing to MKR dilution in scenarios where the MKR token would become worthless (\u201cdeath spiralling\u201d), it becomes possible for the Maker Protocol to safely use the MKR token as a decentralized collateral type. MKR as collateral without death spiral risk reduces exposure to Real World Asset risk while also acting as a voter incentive, reducing the likelihood of governance mismanagement.  2.4: Transparency and predictability The Physical Resilience Scope must in collaboration with the Stability and Liquidity- and the Protocol Engineering Scope define the scenarios and procedure for the changes required by 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3   A de-peg from the USD is a stochastic jump, if it is implemented it will be impossible to re-establish, and the consequences for Dai holders and Vault owners will be comprehensive if not devastating - at least for a period of time. For this kind of change it is advisable to ensure full transparency through pre-defined scenarios and procedures including alerts in advance of all stakeholders affected. If this task and responsibility is not allocated to specific scopes in the constitution, I am afraid it will not get the required attention and collaboration. I advice against letting the Finance scope have decisive influence on risk management.     rune:  3.1: The Easy Governance Frontend (EGF) Definition   Definitions are made throughout the constitution, 3.1 is just an example. In 0 it also looks like definitions are about to be listed. I am agnostic if one or the other solution is pursued, I advice against mixing.     rune:  The EGF is the standardized and constitutionally regulated application that most users will are expected to use to access MKR voter incentives. It is the central community facing feature of the Maker Constitution and is critically important for the resilience of Maker Governance. It is designed to withstand attempts by individuals to manipulate the contents or design of the EGF in order to give them an advantage in the political dynamic of Maker Governance.       rune:  3.4: Importance of immutability Because the design of the EGF has an outsized impact on the outcome of Maker Governance, the design must be near-immutable and rigorously defined in the Interface Scope to ensure all attempts at manipulation will be impossible.       rune:  4.2: Roles of the Constitutional Conservers During the Pregame, the Constitutional Conservers are able to assume 2 critical governance roles: Constitutional Voter Committee Members and Constitutional Delegates. TODO: Describe Early Game, TODO: Describe Midgame TODO: Describe Endgame   The role of the Constitutional Conservers is only described for the pregame. I suggest we add place holders, like it is done in 0 to not forget anything. This is a general observation in the Endgame constitution and applies broadly.     rune:  4.3: Constitutional Conservers eligibility requirements To be eligible, Constitutional Conservers must by signing with their wallet publicly pledge their unbreakable support for preserving the Maker Constitution and to fight against, and make public, all forms of corruption, organizational drift and other constitutional threats that they discover from their embedded position near the inner workings of MakerDAO.   With the recommendation of anonymity, I hope a reputation system will be applied sooner or later. Because of that, I suggest the pledge to be \u201ctechnical\u201d, as a default should lead to deletion of positive reputation or adding negative reputation.     rune:  4.3.1: Constitutional Conservers must work in a transparent manner by documenting all details and considerations their decisions are based on. They may never collude or secretly organize to change the Maker Constitution or the governance dynamic of MakerDAO in general, except within the clearly delineated processes and frameworks of the Maker Constitution.   This section could maybe be based less on pure trust. People secretly organizing might be very hard to discover. Lacking intermediate calculations might be easier to identify and request for all stakeholders.     rune:  4.4: Constitutional Conserver anonymity and privacy Constitutional Conservers are encouraged to be anonymous. After the launch of the Endgame Maker Constitution this will become a requirement. The Physical Resilience scope determines the degree of anonymity required and the consequences of lacking compliance.   I suggest it should be clearly defined of what degree anonymity is required and what the consequences are if the requirement is not met.     rune:  5.3: Governance Strategy Position Documents The core task of CVCs is the consistent creation of Governance Strategy Position Documents for each of the 12 Scopes. The total collection of all latest Governance Strategy Position Documents of a CVC together form the up-to-date guidelines of the CVCs Governance Strategy, which Constitutional Delegates can follow in order to achieve Rank 1 and gain a favorable position in the EGFs.   I suggest the required use of a template to ensure a certain standards are met across all CVCs.     rune:  5.4.1: A CVC must have at least one registered CVC Member that is a Constitutional Conserver and that has publicly verified ownership of 20 MKR, based on the process for verifying MKR as specified in the Arbitration Scope.   I suggest adding a predefined minimum requirement to prevent DDOS-like overload of the Facilitator SubDAOs. The requirement does not have to be very high, its just like a transaction cost.     rune:  5.4.2.3: Existing CVC Members can be removed through a CVC decision.   This is an example of applied negative consequences without a predefined misconduct of the respondent and requirement of presenting evidence of the breach. I suggest defining what behavior can lead to kicking of a CVC member, inspiration can be found from bylaws. This comment also applies to 5.8.1 regarding the ability to ban CDs and 6.8 regarding Constitutional Delegates banning Constitutional Voter Committees.     rune:    5.4.3: A CVC must, through a CVC decision, create a legitimate Governance Strategy Scope Position Document for each of the 12 Scopes, each quarterly governance cycle. CVCs must also convene a CVC Subcomittee Meeting to discuss the creation of the Governance Strategy Scope Position Document for each of the 12 Scopes, each quarterly cycle.  5.4.4: A CVC must at least 1 week prior to a CVC meeting publish the date and time of the meeting, the agenda and a link to join.       rune:  5.6.1: The CVC Member participation compensation is paid out based on participation within each scope every quarter. To qualify for the participation reward for a particular Scope the CVC Member must both have attended the CVC Subcommittee Meeting and be co-author on the CVC Governance Strategy Position Document.   Passive attendance and co-authorship can easily be achieved, meaningful participation and useful contribution can not. I suggest we consider requiring the input to be submitted/adopted to be a requirement for eligibility.     rune:  6.3.9: If the MKR price is below the level where PCDs receive CD income equivalent to an average full time global upper management position, the Arbitration Scope can propose a Dai Stipend that supplements the MKR income to bring the CD income of PCDs to that level, in order to guarantee them with income security.   I suggest removing any discretion. This could e.g. be done by applying the average compensation of a managing director in the US, estimated by Glassdoor.com minus a percentage defined in this constitution. This way the amount is pegged to the surrounding market conditions.     rune:  6.5: Constitutional Delegate alignment risk mitigation CDs are not allowed to engage directly with Ecosystem Actors and other counterparties to the DAO, or in other ways engage in operational activities. They must remain focused on providing governance information and research material to MKR holders, and acting as counterparties to the Facilitors. They are also not allowed to provide \u201ckickbacks\u201d from their compensation to MKR holders that delegate to them. Any violation of these requirements constitutes breaching the Constitutional Conserver pledge.   From reading this section, I assume the the following communication is allowed, since it is not described in the alignment risk mitigation: a) Communication between CDs and Council/Tribunal members, b) Communication between CDs and other Constitutional Conservers and c) Communication between CDs and Dai users (e.g. DEXes, loan protocols, non-competing DAOs, private Dai holders, etc. CDs might need to know what the Ecosystem Actors are doing. Adding a one-way reporting requirement could help fill this gap.     rune:  6.8: Constitutional Delegate banning of Constitutional Voter Committee CDs can ban CVCs if they determine and prove that the CVC is making decisions contrary to the communicated vision, values and byline of the CVC, and as a result is effectively disenfranchising voters who were misled as to what Governance Strategy they were delegating to. When a CD bans a CVC, it is equivalent to the CVC banning the CD, and the Governance Strategy of the CD, for the banned CVC, is transformed into an independent Governance Strategy, and the voters stop counting towards the total support of the CVC when determining its position in the EGF.       rune:  9.6: Ossification of Scope Framework Elements Elements in Scope Frameworks within the Constitutional Boundaries cannot be freely changed by Maker Governance. A general ossification rule is applied which means that new changes must be congruent in magnitude with recent changes. This means that Elements that have not been changed for a very long time can only be modified slightly - however if Elements have been continuously changed in recent times, they are considered not ossified and much more significant changes can be made to them within a single cycle.   I suggest defining who assesses if a change is congruent and the procedure that applies for ossification/making changes. 10: Councils and Tribunals I suggest we add a section describing the obligations and boundaries of Councils and Tribunals. There is an immensely great power associated with having the right to form strategies and submit influence proposals that are submitted. This could cover how they are formed, how they work, how the communicate and document their decisions, how they make sure to include input from other stakeholders, how they are paid, etc.         ",

Its purpose is to provide a stable means of payment and store of value, without being tied to the volatile nature of traditional cryptocurrencies  ** Or, perhaps this can be added to 1.1     rune:  4.1: Constitutional Conservers Definition Constitutional Conservers are external entities that play a fundamental role in facilitating and protecting the Maker Governance process by ensuring it occurs according to the processes defined in the Maker Constitution.   Rephrase suggestion: Constitutional conservators play a crucial role in facilitating and safeguarding the Maker Governance process by making sure it follows the procedures outlined in the Maker Constitution. They provide MKR holders with the ability to participate in Maker Governance in a way that aligns with their long-term interests as MKR holders, even if there is limited common ground among them. As a result, constitutional conservators enable MKR holders to make informed decisions that are in their best interest.     rune:  4.2: Roles of the Constitutional Conservers During the Pregame, the Constitutional Conservers are able to assume 2 critical governance roles: Constitutional Voter Committee Members and Constitutional Delegates.     4.2.1 Constitutional conservators serve as impartial and neutral entities, working to maintain the integrity of the Maker Governance process and ensure that it is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Maker Constitution. .   4.2.1 With their critical role in maintaining the stability and accountability of the Maker system, constitutional conservators are essential to the long-term success of Maker Governance and the well-being of the MKR token holders.       rune:  4.3: Constitutional Conservers eligibility requirements To be eligible, Constitutional Conservers must publicly pledge their unbreakable support for preserving the Maker Constitution and to fight against, and make public, all forms of corruption, organizational drift and other constitutional threats that they discover from their embedded position near the inner workings of MakerDAO.   This pledge of support must be unbreakable and demonstrated through their actions as a constitutional conservator. Constitutional conservators have a unique vantage point, as they have close access to the inner workings of MakerDAO, and are in a prime position to detect any potential issues that may arise. As such, it is essential that they maintain their impartiality and integrity, and use their position to actively protect the Maker system from any threats to its stability and constitutionality.     rune:  4.3.1: Constitutional Conservers may never collude or secretly organize to change the Maker Constitution or the governance dynamic of MakerDAO in general, except within the clearly delineated processes and frameworks of the Maker Constitution.   They must always act within the framework of the Maker Constitution and follow the established processes for making changes to the system. Any attempt to manipulate the Maker Constitution or governance processes outside of these clearly defined channels is strictly prohibited and goes against the fundamental principles of impartiality and fairness that constitutional conservators are expected to uphold.     rune:  5.1: Voter Committee Definition Voter Committees are groups of MKR holders that publicly coordinate to analyze the best voting behaviour based on a particular strategy, and publicly coordinate political positioning with other Voter Committees and voting blocs to reach compromises and middle grounds that minimize bad decisions. The base form of Voter Committees are the Permissionless Voter Committees which is a very simple designation for any kind of organized voting group.   By working together and sharing their insights and perspectives, Voter Committees play an important role in shaping the outcome of Maker Governance and ensuring that the decisions made are in the best interests of the MKR holders.     rune:  5.1: Voter Committee Definition Voter Committees are groups of MKR holders that publicly coordinate to analyze the best voting behaviour based on a particular strategy, and publicly coordinate political positioning with other Voter Committees and voting blocs to reach compromises and middle grounds that minimize bad decisions. The base form of Voter Committees are the Permissionless Voter Committees which is a very simple designation for any kind of organized voting group.   By participating in the Maker Governance process through their membership in a Constitutional Voter Committee, Constitutional Conservers play a crucial role in shaping the future of the Maker system and ensuring its stability and success over the long term.     rune:  5.3: Governance Strategy Position Documents The core task of CVCs is the consistent creation of Governance Strategy Position Documents for each of the 12 Scopes. The total collection of all latest Governance Strategy Position Documents of a CVC together form the up-to-date guidelines of the CVCs Governance Strategy, which Constitutional Delegates can follow in order to achieve Rank 1 and gain a favorable position in the EGFs.     5.2.1 By following the guidelines set out in the CVC\u2019s Governance Strategy Position Documents, Constitutional Delegates can help ensure that the Maker Governance process is guided by informed and well-considered perspectives, and that the best interests of the MKR holders are represented.      rune:  5.4: Constitutional Voter Committee Recognition Process     5.4.4: A CVC must also provide regular updates on its activities and decisions to the Arbitration Scope and other relevant Scopes to ensure that it continues to fulfill its obligations as a CVC and is in compliance with the Maker Constitution.      rune:  5.5: Constitutional Voter Committee support and infrastructure A CVC receives support and infrastructure from the Ecosystem Scope in order make it as easy as possible to create or participate in them. The most important is access communications platforms, including forums and chatroom, and support in arranging and operating CVC Subcommittee Meetings. The infrastructure must be continuously improved to be as reliable, decentralized and privacy-preserving as possible. If necessary the Ecosystem Scope must prioritize resources towards CVCs with more verified MKR and more Governance Strategy followers.   (perhaps Add) CVCs are also eligible for access to certain tools and resources for voter analysis, voting coordination and research. These resources are made available by the Ecosystem Scope in order to help CVCs make informed decisions and effectively communicate their Governance Strategy positions to the wider MakerDAO community.     rune:  5.6: CVC Member participation rewards     5.6.6 The reward mechanism (slots) are designed in a way that encourages equal participation from all CVC Members, regardless of their MKR balances. This is important in order to ensure that the CVCs are representative of the entire Maker Community, rather than just those with the most MKR.      rune:  5.7: Display of CVCs in EGFs     5.7.2: The logo of a CVC must be a distinctive, recognizable symbol that represents the CVC\u2019s mission and values.   5.7.3: The name and byline of a CVC must accurately reflect the focus of the CVC and provide a clear message to potential users.       rune:  6.6: Constitutional Delegate Charity While CDs are not allowed to be involved in operational activities, or allocate their CD income towards operational activities, the one exception is using a portion of their CD income for donations to charity. It is encouraged that CDs compete and campaign on their ability to achieve some level of charitable impact with the resources available to them, in order to demonstrate alignment with the public good purpose of the DAO.     6.6.1: Purpose The purpose of the Constitutional Delegate Charity is to encourage CDs to demonstrate their alignment with the public good purpose of the DAO, and to use their CD income for positive social impact.   6.6.2: Allocation of CD Income CDs are encouraged to allocate a portion of their CD income towards charitable causes. This allocation can be in the form of direct donations to charitable organizations, or through initiatives aimed at promoting positive social impact. The exact amount and manner in which the CD income is allocated is up to each individual CD.   6.6.3: Encouragement of Competition The Maker DAO community is encouraged to support CDs that demonstrate a strong commitment to social impact and charitable initiatives.       rune:  6.8: Constitutional Delegate banning of Constitutional Voter Committee CDs can ban CVCs if they determine that the CVC is making decisions contrary to the communicated vision, values and byline of the CVC, and as a result is effectively disenfranchising voters who were misled as to what Governance Strategy they were delegating to. When a CD bans a CVC, it is equivalent to the CVC banning the CD, and the Governance Strategy of the CD, for the banned CVC, is transformed into an independent Governance Strategy, and the voters stop counting towards the total support of the CVC when determining its position in the EGF.   This allows for the CD to ensure that the voters are informed of the CVC\u2019s actions and are given the opportunity to delegate to a different Governance Strategy if they so choose. ",

This also levels the playing field completely in terms of bias, as everyone will be playing by the exact same rules and can play whatever role they want with their pseudonyms. The useful analogy is that the constitutional conserver role is eventually supposed to just be run by AI that just follows the rules and competes on straightforward stuff like efficiency and measurable results, and by having anonymity as a requirement it will be much simpler to transition to that stage. And the exact language for how to define this is something we need to collaborate on for the Endgame Maker Constitution itself. It is actually technically wrong to even talk about the future plans in the pregame constitution, since all of that should just be shown directly in the endgame constitution. I just put it there to provide some context to understood the emphasis endgame places on having the constitutional conservers be unreachable, since the endgame constitution draft is not out yet. ",

The Clean Money Fund will be managed through the Ecosystem Scope. The initial MKR reserves allocated to the Clean Money Fund is 20,000 MKR. The Clean Money Fund is a temporary measure and will wind down and be fully replaced by the Purpose System in 2040.   We strongly recommend striking this section. This level of dilution would almost entirely undo the net burn of MKR to date. This would break a fundamental promise made to MKR holders that the asset would return funds not needed for the maintenance and development of the protocol. It also seems out of scope for Maker \u2013 a piece of software focused on growing an unbiased medium of exchange \u2013 to choose to take on the responsibility of advocating for specific environmental causes. In particular, the level of dilution from this single clause would be enough that @makerburn may need to change their website domain.     rune:  It is not a guaranteed commitment, which means that it is possible for Maker Governance to reject an automatic MKR generation event, and instead impose a haircut on the value of Dai.

Looking at this as forking the US Constitution and making it a permissionless ecosystem run by smart contracts is ambitious.  More broadly, though, enabling the first principles of that theme: this entire constitution needs to be split into a very hardened version of Maker\u2019s values. All the specifics about achieving that value need a Bill of Rights type of structure, which is already what MIPs are if you think about it. Second @GFXlabs that working towards a MIP zero edit is fine. The timeline matters, throwing them all out is a worthy notion, but zooming back to the high level, why the rush?  I would advocate one extra month to really dial in the first pieces and move compensation details into their own structure. Good candidates for amendment debates:  Clean money, the biggest issue with clean money is switching the focus towards forward-looking outcomes and ones we can actually monitor. I think @CodeKnight made this point. Easy voting frontend - anything that is a product doesn\u2019t fall under principles. Could also have a generalized placeholder similar to scopes though. Prescriptive MKR amounts, I know there has been a lot of thinking about MKR amounts in all of these MIPs but in general, trying to call the market value upfront instead of building a series of milestones is generally problematic. Moving the specifics of compensation elsewhere where they can be adaptive to changing market conditions is probably better in the long term. Anonymity as a requirement needs a timeline. As of now, we can\u2019t do that since most MKR holders are known. That looks like these components moving to a \u201cfirst set of amendments\u201d or \u201cadditional amendments supporting the constitution\u201d MIP: 1.3 ; 3 ; 4.3.1 - 4.4 ; 5.4 - 5.8 ; 6.3 - 6.8  ",

Including, for example, where anonymity is enabled technically, encouraged or required. This policy objective is being massively underrated:     rune:  The point is that it should not be possible for potential attackers, bribers etc to know which companies or people to target, and it shouldn\u2019t be possible for the constitutional conservers themselves to appeal to real life personal connections or social politics to accumulate power. This also levels the playing field completely in terms of bias, as everyone will be playing by the exact same rules and can play whatever role they want with their pseudonyms.   We\u2019ve been encouraging the community to speak about the benefits of anonymity from the perspective of policy makers and users of the system, rather than what many wrongfully assume is a policy designed to shield members from accountability, legal liability and ethical responsibility. Note that the anon policy happens to be very PRO regenerative economy. It is a measure that promotes inclusion and mitigates bias in social relations, access to opportunities and reward for merit. These are areas we should expect to see a Regenerative Finance CVC support, in addition to other provisions that advance community culture and work satisfaction.

For people whose eyes glaze over, or worse, become combative at the prospect of MakerDAO codifying itself as having a Pubic Good purpose please educate yourself about possibly the most important conversation and experimentation happening in the ecosystem. For the Endgame DVC Call critics yesterday, if you are getting stuck on and are upset to see a Public Good Fund of 20K MKR established, you do not understand the moment. Nor do you realize that DeFi, \u201ccrypto\u201d or however you would define this entire space has absolutely maxed out and tapped out on being powered by short-term shitcoin gambling degeneracy. If you represent or manage tens/hundreds of millions or billions in capital for other ultra wealthy people, and bristle at the idea MakerDAO might dare SHARE prosperity with the world, in the era to come you will fail in your responsibility to steward capital for the preservation and return of value to those very people. Why? Because what people in the regenerative economy movement and supporters of public good funding with Ethereum and Bitcoin OGs understand is that the extraction and exploitation model of the last centuries has put ALL of us at the bitter end of mercy in the tragedy of the commons. From wikipedia  In economics and in an ecological context, the tragedy of the commons is a situation in which individual users, who have open access to a resource unhampered by shared social structures, formal rules, charges, fees, or taxes that regulate access and use,[1][2] act independently according to their own self-interest and, contrary to the common good of all users, cause depletion of the resource through their uncoordinated action in the case that there are too many users related to the available resources.[3]  In brief, there is not going to be any more prosperity for anyone if we don\u2019t redesign economies, markets, social structures and incentives in a way that preserves and grows the pie for more people. You don\u2019t actually have to care about other people or charity to see the point. Just caring about yourself and your own wealth is actually fine, because if you are smart you also understand it won\u2019t exist for long at this stage of human evolution if people in power continue to hoard and ignore those upon whose backs their wealth has actually been built in the very first place. MakerDAO aligning itself with Public Good Purpose is the most powerful thing it can do for long-term success. It is a smart BUSINESS decision. A scarcity mindset wanting to isolate value within insular internet money games is not going to get any of this adopted, not going to grow DAI supply or user base demand, not going to grow mind-share, not going to attract the best and the brightest people, not going to endear the project to the larger society guardians and actors who are rightfully scornful and hostile towards this industry. Don\u2019t believe me? Maybe you prefer to hear from Vitalik? In this impactful talk before the Oct 2022 merge took place, he discusses mechanisms for funding public goods, giving his view of the latest thinking around novel public funding experiments and exciting new projects in the ecosystem.      \u201cBlockchain communities are a very natural fit for public goods. This is interesting because a lot of the early ideology of blockchains was really focused on private goods. It\u2019s focused on things like creating really powerful and robust individual property rights, markets, systems for trade creation, decentralized exchanges and similar things, but public goods are actually hugely important to blockchain communities.\u201d \u201cIn blockchain communities, public goods are hugely important, perhaps more so than private goods.\u201d \u201cPublic goods are long-term problems, therefore they need long-term and systematic solutions. This means that we need funding to come from not just individuals and also not just companies, because companies, too, can disappear, but from applications and/or protocols.\u201d \u201cOnce these public goods funding mechanisms get big enough, they\u2019ll be able to have a scope of concern far beyond the crypto ecosystems themselves. They\u2019re going to be a potentially significant part of how humanity ends up building the 21st century.\u201d \u201cThis big vision is very dependent on crypto and blockchains continuing to succeed in order to be able to actually have the funding to realize these ambitions. Also, as these funding projects get bigger, ecosystems are going to form around these funding mechanisms.\u201d ",
