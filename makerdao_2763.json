Because we haven\u2019t touched the DSR in a while, everyone missed this until the last moment. (Thanks to @cmooney for being the first to remember + @Kurt_Barry for telling me.) As a result, we\u2019ll make this DSR change in the MIPs executive on Monday rather than in the executive today. If the community wants to change how this works (currently the DSR is set to follow the base rate.) Feel free to signal on the issue. It was my job to keep track of this, so apologies to all for the oversight. ",
