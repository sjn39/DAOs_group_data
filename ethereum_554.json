I predict that something like this will increase the cost of security because it introduces additional uncertainty for future block rewards.  Right now miners have to take on the risk of a future hard fork changing their future block rewards (and this is currently an extremely high risk due to the expectation of PoS).  This contract will not remove that risk, but instead adds a new risk in that the assembly can now also change future mining rewards, without a hard fork.  So where there was previously one risk of future block rewards changing, there are now two risks. Since we can\u2019t prevent hard forks changing block reward, I argue that adding in a second mechanism for changing block rewards doesn\u2019t solve any new problem and instead just introduces potential problems and attack vectors.

On that regards I\u2019d like to add a few points:  this would only make sense during the move to PoS, when block rewards to miners are being slashed anyway and validador rewards are likely to still need tweaking if there\u2019s a known minimum amount that must go towards security we could put that in the contract, but not sure it\u2019s true since bitcoin for instance moves in the long term to a zero issuance scheme miners have some assurances guaranteed by the contract: among them that any changes in issuance can only happen with a huge advance notice, meaning that you are guaranteed that whatever you mine today and in the next six months, you\u2019ll still receive. you misunderstood the purpose of split prevention. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s intended to prevent people from creating forks, it\u2019s important that this power remains with users, but it creates a non-consensus layer in which those questions can be addressed to disincentive people from forking. If they still feel disenfranchised then they can have the fork. It\u2019s a negotiation table, not a disarming campaign  @dontpanic do you feel miners got rob from \u201ctheir\u201d ether when we changed reward from 5 to 3? Feels foolish playing the semantic game of who ether in the protocol really belongs. ",

                    "content": "I dont think it is semantics challenge at all. The system guarantees only 3 ways to own ether, Premine, purchase, or mining. Mining serves as a proxy for purchasing ether in that one pays for electricity an equivalent worth as they would value the ether at (one ether always costs one ether to mine). The social contract, as I understand it is that each account owner owns their ether outright. No preconditions. Miners \u201cpurchasing\u201d ether from the system by verifying transactions should have the same assurance that a trader purchasing from another user has; that the ether they purchase is theirs. If all ether belongs to the system, rather than the indivdual account holder, more interesting taxation is possible but it does require a more formalized governance system. I saw the reduction as pointless from a technical standpoint. The system functions equally well with 5, 100, or 3 ether being distributed. The change offered no technical benefit, and caused no harm. The average price per m/hash has remained relatively stable the last few years and is on par with coins that use the same algo. The hash market is pretty efficient. The distinction between validators and miners is small. I would assume the same expectations from a validator in pos as a miner in pow; a way to have fair representation and a long enough period after a vote for the minority to identify the change and adjust accordingly.

The only difference is that these conditions can change by a social contract (which will in itself also have delays to further increase these guarantees. There\u2019s an interesting question there about how can a  lock in work: if the goal is to align the receivers incentives with the long term health of the network and to give some long term guarantees, then i thought justa having a time delay would be sufficient but maybe it\u2019s not (not sure if that\u2019s where you were going), because it can lead to a situation where, if the receiving contract just delays payments by 6 months, it means that once a decision is made, miners mining right after the decision will not receive their ether in 6 months and that\u2019s certainly not something we want. Maybe it would be necessary to have a period of x weeks between when any change was decided and it actually happening, and another period of x weeks between a change happening and the contract being able to \u2018withdraw\u2019 from the issuance contract. This way there\u2019s some assurance that, whatever work you are providing now, you will be surely paid and your \u2018contract\u2019 will guaranteed at least a few more months of work. ",

I.e. \u201cEIP 1015: Dynamic\u2026\u201d I have heard arguments against onchain governance, e.g. as listed here by Vlad and Vitalik. Essentially we need to be very careful about any kind of on-chain governance that modifies how the protocol operates, which is what this EIP is proposing, and need to make sure that existing participants that secure the network (such as miners with PoW, validators with PoS and proposers and collators with sharding) are not disenfranchised from the governance process.
