The Block    Class action lawsuit accuses Uniswap Labs, its investors of allowing... A new class-action lawsuit from a Uniswap user alleges that Uniswap Labs and its backers are culpable for her losses due to a failure to comply with securities laws.      \u2022\tAccording to the joint press release put out by the two law firms engaged in the action, the allegations are that Uniswap (and the other defendants) violated the securities laws by offering and selling unregistered securities in the form of digital tokens on the Uniswap exchange, including Uniswap\u2019s own UNI token. \u2022\tWhile they did name the UNI token, the lawsuits seeks to remedy investors who utilized Uniswap to purchase the EthereumMax, Bezoge, Matrix Samurai, Alphawolf Finance, Rocket Bunny, and BoomBaby.io. Being that this action pertains to an asset which has yet to be designated a commodity or a security, it should be interesting to watch. Happy reading and learning! ",

Here is a link to the complaint: I wasn\u2019t able to download it without using PACER (the federal court\u2019s e-filing system) so hopefully this will work in case people want to read it:   Scribd    Risley vs Universal | PDF | Cryptocurrency | Market Liquidity Source: PACER      It\u2019s fitting that this matter has been brought in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) as other crypto related actions, both criminal and civil, are being prosecuted in the district. The SDNY is sometimes known as the \u201cSovereign\u201d District of New York due to the US Attorney\u2019s  SDNY office tending to do its own thing, that sometimes includes bucking the trends of the Justice Department. I predict that going forward many of the relevant federal cases in the US will also be venued in the SDNY (which includes Wall Street). The Judges in the SDNY, as well as the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals Judges, will likely become the more knowledgeable. ",
