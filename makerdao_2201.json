By being aware of the luring risks upfront, you get a better chance of dodging them. In the end, you don\u2019t care whether you get robbed by a criminal person, group, or state. This forum post is meant as a kick-starter for the discussion of what could go into the Physical Resilience Scope Framework. Jurisdictional differences, activities, and tradeoffs It is important to stress that there is a huge difference in the risk from one country and jurisdiction to another. Some countries are corrupt or have cartels, others have unpredictable regulators. The risk level of cause also depends on the personal circumstances of each individual stakeholder. Choosing one approach to manage risk comes with some tradeoffs. As an example, becoming an anon to reduce personal threat might increase the other risk of being rejected or off-boarded by your banks. The choices must be made case by case. Identified risks Personal risk (requiring physical access or proximity)  Physical attacks e.g. coercion, violence, assassination, etc. Ending up in jail Being arrested Abusive litigation Being robbed (threat or physical force) Home invasion Being kidnapped for a ransom or other extortion Being denied access to enter foreign countries Being retained and questioned when entering foreign countries Being tapped  Economic risk (physical access or proximity not always a requirement)  Seizure of funds or assets off-chain Fines (and other penalties) Freeze of crypto assets Hacking Malware (e.g. 29 attack vectors through USB) Side-Channel Attack Phishing Social engineering Theft Supply Chain Attack Fraud Embezzlement Abusive litigation Wealth taxes Evil Maid Attack: possible whenever an attacker has unattended access to your computer, phone, or hardware wallet. (Be aware of hotel maids, airport x-ray personnel, etc.)  Risk of losing access to critical infrastructure  Limitation of access to on-chain infrastructure \u2013 Transactions being blocked from services (blocked by the frontend) \u2013 Transactions being excluded from blocks Limitation of access to off-chain infrastructure \u2013 Not being able to get a bank account \u2013 Having existing customer relationships terminated with the bank based on \u201cderisking\u201d  Risk of having the freedom of speech limited  Being silenced/banned/deleted from SoMe/the internet Having a Github account deleted  Risk management Risk can be managed in several ways. Some methods are obvious, like anonymity to hide from psycho people in jumpsuits. Some methods are still being figured out like no one really knows yet what protection a DAO or decentralization provides and for whom. Below are some topics to consider when designing risk management. The list is non-exhaustive. Anonymity  Anonymity on the individual level Anonymity on a team level Anonymity for governance participation and counceling-work Anonymity for delegates How to obtain and share (good and bad) reputation for anons  Cyber Security  Cold storage Following best (online behavior) 2 Factor Authentication (not SMS or Authy) Separate hardware for work and private Gnosis safe Secure VPN Password manager Block malware  Decentralization   Legal \u2013 Separation of roles - contribution, facilitation, governance, counseling, voting \u2013 Employed vs. contractor (project-based budgeting is a great example) \u2013 Separation of interest on a company level (group vs. individual) \u2013 Re-delegation opportunities \u2013 Minority protection rules \u2013 Quorum requirements \u2013 The number of layers involved from discussion to action (the decision-making process) \u2013 Limiting the ability of any single party to take control of the system\u2019s governance \u2013 Procedures to avoid MITM attacks \u2013 Procedures to keep every role in check   Technical \u2013 The governance structure. We can not accept when things are siloed into small groups (with agendas\u2026) \u2013 Transparency and reduction of information asymmetries (the new auditing tool is just wonderful). \u2013 Communication \u2013 Reputation \u2013 Product and tech stack \u2013 Treasury management \u2013 Audit trails e.g. on-chain voting \u2013 For frontends IPFS links + ENS hosting   Autonomy  Use of smart contracts: Help run an increasing part of the processes with as little human interference as possible Built-in motivation/game theory: independence is important, if all contributors quit on the same day, new ones should automatically be motivated to take over the work (we need a marketplace for Maker-related work) Making it as self-governing as possible, as much as possible must be carried out without any outside control. The organization must engage in its own policing and adjudication of misconduct. Use of the product and governance influence The autonomy must be a quality of the people \u2014the organization\u2014 which uses the smart contracts for what it is built for and apply changes to it to enhance them. Ownership, IP, and distribution of funds Can not be controlled by a company or a small pre-determined group of people. It must be by the DAO. Open Source Code Repository  Organization - must be seen in connection with decentralization   Individuals or entities interacting with governance in any DAO should do so through entities, for limited liability protections or be anons.   Using a company with limited liability should also be considered \u2013 On Scope / Core Unit level \u2013 On a SubDAO level \u2013 For facilitators that are not anons (as it also might be seen as governance) \u2013 For independent contributors that are not anons \u2013 For Ecosystem Actors that are not anons   Documentation of independency   Documentation of no hierachy   The Defense Fund I have very little knowledge about the Defense Fund, if it can protect a contributor from personal or financial harm without causing centralization that is damaging the DAO, I support it! My hope is that the fund becomes able to allocate funds for lawyers\u2019 fees without an individual or group of individuals being sued directly. Requirement of step plans We should make sure the Physical Resilience Scope Framework gets a step plan in place for how to act in case Maker receives a Wells Notice or (another) patent troll files a subpoena. Anonymity vs. large scale institutional adoption In TradFi you always want to know who runs the business for (a) making sure they have the right skill set and (b) to make someone is made responsible if anything goes wrong. As I see it, enhanced anonymity is not a feature to hide from responsibility. We need to make sure, this is expressed clearly. I suggest we assess how to comfort external institutions in the best possible way to accept the increasing use of anonymity. This should be done in collaboration with the people responsible for designing the reputation system and by talking with the institutional RWA-players we already collaborate with. Drawing a line in the sand The Physical Resilience Scope Framework should define where it draws a line in the sand (a) every month on the 1st, and (b) in case of specific events. In addition, it should describe how far it sees the regulators are from crossing the line, and what it bases that view on. Finally, it should give examples of what will happen if the line is crossed.

                    "content": "Hey @0xDefensor , thank you for this great post. Agree that legal risk management should be covered in the Physical Resilience Scope. Topics we will need to develop (among others):   Frameworks for assessing the likelihood and severity of legal risks (from the point of view of  protocol resilience) so we can prioritize accordingly.   Design and implementation  of relevant risk mitigation instruments: OpSec policies (as described  in your posts), self insurance, financial reinsurance, legal structuring, etc.   Definition of relevant legal governance processes, e.g. regulatory risk monitoring, protocols for legal defense and representation, emergency procedures, Endgame arbitration and enforcement, interactions between Engame paritcipants, etc   Documentation and formalization of these processes, so we can productize them and embed them in the DAO toolkit.   The Legal Defense Fund is designed as a first-loss, self - insurance reserve fund assigned to cover legal defense costs. Once implemented, it can be leveraged to cover additional risks or stakeholders, so we believe it will play a foundational role in a comprehensive legal risk management strategy. We are updating the proposal to the Endgame structure and will discuss it in the upcoming Physical Resilience Scope calls! ",
