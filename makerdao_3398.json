                    "content": " Preamble MIP39c2-SP: 9 Author: Kathleen Chu  Contributors: Sahabia Yakubu, Kaori Sato, Francesco Alberti  Status: Rejected Date Applied: 2021-03-25 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>   Specification  Motivation The MakerDAO community is energetic and highly engaged, thanks to the core community\u2019s concerted efforts and initiatives. The unit recognizes that reaching new audiences and users is vital for Dai\u2019s mass adoption. Based on that conclusion, the unit is formed to be dedicated to outreach. We are proposing this unit to the DAO because it delivers the following:  A clear, consistent, and coordinated communication across key channels A cohesive global branding with a strong focus on marketing strategy tailored for targeted key markets that match the needs suitable for each stage of growth in Dai awareness and adoption  The core unit identifies targeted audiences and helps them learn about MakerDAO as it enters the next growth phase. The team builds on the recognition MakerDAO has gained in the cryptocurrency space and expands into the mainstream.   The unit will increase general awareness of MakerDAO and focus on Dai adoption by creating specific marketing initiatives for each targeted market.   The marketing activities will also be designed based on the needs of other units at MakerDAO to achieve our organizational objectives.   The strategic communications portion protects the credibility of MakerDAO by providing an accurate understanding of MakerDAO and clear and consistent messaging.   The unit highlights milestones and provides information in a language that anyone can understand.   As the Maker Foundation dissolves, more information and clarity will be required during this period of change.  The DAO needs a team with ample experience and a proven track record to ensure a smooth transition through coherent communication to the general public and regional communities. The unit will also jumpstart the marketing efforts without delays to further expand the MakerDAO ecosystem. The team consists of individuals that have persistently demonstrated their ability to achieve results.   Core Unit Name Strategic Marcomms Core Unit CPM-001  Mandate Consistent and strategic branding strengthens the name of MakerDAO and creates value. The team filters out the complexity of MakerDAO and makes information easy to digest for our targeted audience. The unit\u2019s expertise in branding and communication is vital for a decentralized organization such as MakerDAO. It increases the visibility of Dai and promotes Dai adoption through the following mandate:  Represent the interests of the MakerDAO community Help target audience understand the benefits of Dai by providing educational content and events Plan, initiate and execute marketing and community activities on behalf of the project Collaborate with other units to achieve objectives identified for MakerDAO Be the point of contact for major media across the globe Facilitate interviews with MakerDAO facilitators and relevant contributors to create value through PR strategies Inherit and manage key social media platforms, MakerDAO\u2019s homepage, and blog Adapt and modify strategy as needed (localization, hypothesis validation discovery, legal climate change, etc.)   Objectives The unit will help MakerDAO grow by  Increasing the awareness of Dai and the Maker Protocol Boosting Dai adoption through promotions and partnerships Addressing marketing and PR-related needs from other core units such as priming potential partners for business development and RWA adoption-related discussions Having an evolving and collaborative mindset to grow with other units and the community   Strategy Based on a SWOT analysis, one can see that even though Dai captures all the advantages of blockchain, its growth has lagged behind centralized stablecoin. Without a more aggressive approach, it could potentially put MakerDAO further behind others. This can be tackled in many fronts, including collaboration of CUs such as RWA, Growth, and this Strategic Marcomms MIP put forward. With Strategic Marcomms, our focus will be on boosting our visibility in jurisdictions where Dai has gained legal status, while seeking ways to expand our PR activities in countries where legality remains in question. Boosting our visibility means a) an increase in marketing and ads spending for channels we identify as key for our targeted audience b) boosting visibility through earned, as well as paid media, utilizing PR agencies Key strategies for our unit include the following:  Lowering the entry barriers for new potential users through hosting events, community building, PR, and educational content Finding narratives that connect with our targeted users and align with their values through storytelling Highlighting benefits that our targeted users deem most valuable through messaging Developing and activating programs that can bolster our marketing initiatives  Target audience groups and key markets:   Target audience  Digital native-generation and crypto users and who haven\u2019t used Dai Individuals in the financial sector and the technology sector who tend to have a basic understanding of the critical components of open finance or DeFi Sectors identified by other facilitators as key to their success such as examples of verticals listed by the Growth Core Unit.    Market and use-case specific  Countries experiencing hyperinflation in regions such as Latin America Region of a large population with mobile, but relatively low number of bank accounts such as Africa Those living in countries with near-zero interest rates such as the EU, Japan Regions with a substantial remittance need such as Southeast Asia and LatAm We can achieve our objectives more quickly through economies of scale in the world\u2019s three biggest economies: the U.S., China, and Japan    The unit is open to evolve with the MakerDAO community and partnership.  Projects and Programs The team plans to tackle the targeted audience by introducing several global-wide programs that are most likely to achieve results. The unit will implement the following initiatives and focus on the marketing channels listed below with several new ideas to be introduced in stage throughout the year: Word-of-Mouth - Dai\u2019s benefits and the story of MakerDAO can be explained more effectively with more credibility when it is from a third-party such as Dai users and partners, and advocates. The unit will pursue and provide opportunities for others to share their experiences. Storytelling - Deliver actual stories on how our global community members use Dai in their life to motivate current and prospective users\u2019 interaction with Dai and Maker. Stories will be conveyed in our blog and/or on podcasts. Scalability - The team plans to introduce programs that enable us to extend our reach effectively.   Ambassador program - Develop and activate a program that can bring scalability to the unit to increase the visibility of Maker and Dai   Translation program - Create and launch a translation program that expands our reach by providing information in more languages identified as key.   Marketing campaigns and advertising - The unit will conduct marketing and advertising campaigns for our target user segments. They include joint marketing campaigns with partners and buying ads on platforms where our target user segments are. The unit takes all marketing or advertising opportunities into consideration. PR - Utilizing earned media, shared media, and owned media adequately   News outlets (earned media) - Identify audiences and key news outlets for the audiences, reach out to those targeted news outlets, and pitch stories when major milestones reached   Social Media (shared media) - Specific content planned and scheduled to share regularly with a targeted audience in each major social media platforms   Blog and other contents (owned media) - Create blog content and utilize platforms such as Podcast, or Clubhouse to gather audience and followers.    Region-Specific Strategy One size doesn\u2019t fit all. In addition to the global strategy, the unit adopts a bottom-up approach to extend our reach in regional markets by adopting the best practices for each market under a shared vision. Targeted regions are in different stages, with unique challenges and opportunities: NORTH AMERICA North America is the most prominent crypto market. Our approach in the region is to increase our visibility through PR activities, collaborating with partners while running advertisement and marketing campaigns. Marketing activities will be planned and executed following the guidelines of U.S. regulation.  Collaborate with blockchain news outlets on finance and technology, utilizing earned and paid media to increase visibility. Run social media ads for educational and informative content to reach more target audiences. Partner with institutions such as universities and blockchain technology labs and sponsoring hackathons to position Maker as a thought leader and educator. Enable meetup pods in the major North American cities in all tech and incubation houses. Sponsor large technology conferences such as SXSW, partnering with various festivals for DAI payments.  SOUTH AMERICA South America has experienced a surge in cryptocurrency usage in the last couple of years. Issues like hyperinflation, low wages, and government policy make stablecoins a necessity and expose market fit as default for the whole region. Marketing campaigns and educational initiatives are needed to help people understand the value proposition of Maker and DAI, and how it could have a positive impact on their ability to store, manage, and spend their savings.  Boost public recognition of DAI in the Region by increasing the audience and reach of our social media channels. Expand our activities by finding ambassadors in other countries where our reach is limited. Boost the use of DAI in the region as a method of exchange and savings by promoting the P2P marketplaces already established (Venezuela, Colombia) and creating new ones (Per\u00fa, Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay). Hold Meetups focused on using the tools available for DAI and MakerDAO. Placement of advertising material in specific areas, such as posters and billboards.  EUROPE A very active region with several internationally renowned blockchain hubs with slightly different focuses such as favorable regulations, favorable taxation, high quality financial system, high standards for privacy, rich startup ecosystem, or special concerns on democracy/governance. Europe also boasts many grassroot blockchain-related organizations and highly regarded crypto-native organizations; it also features a growing number of mainstream and government-related entities getting involved in blockchain (universities, startup centers and more).  Our top priority in Europe will be to leverage the local communities for growth in Dai awareness, onboarding and usage. This will be achieved via presentations, classes, courses and workshops. Collaborations, partnerships and an ambassador program will be put in place to supercharge this effort. With relevant organizations and communities from within and outside of the crypto industry. Identify and reach out to audiences and communities that are ripe for crypto adoption. This may include digital natives studying blockchain at university, communities who have a local currency in web2 or paper format, meetup groups focused on fintech, meetup groups focused on tech within minorities (i.e. women who code), meetup groups focused on open source and/or privacy. Targeted marketing and PR campaigns will help reinforce awareness within the communities and audiences identified. Collaboration with language-specific highly regarded crypto public figures. Localizing content, this can include the official website and some other key content. We will prioritize language according to identified hubs and most spoken languages. For instance German is very high on the list as Berlin and Zug are both German speaking. Other languages include Spanish, French and Russian which are some of the world\u2019s most spoken languages.  AFRICA Faced with currency devaluation and high inflation rate, Africa has high demand for financial services like loans, savings/investment and international payments. Our priority and initial marketing focus will be research, exploration and education. The targeted markets initially include Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya as they have been identified preliminary as where the crypto users are.  We can effectively motivate potential users after research identifies where crypto can be used (internet access, mobile) and where partnership makes sense. There\u2019s a need for education regarding money via introductory campaigns and similar initiatives to improve financial literacy and overcome barriers regarding financial services. Our marketing approach will consider the region\u2019s unique infrastructure and leapfrogging development to employ locally relevant and meaningful communication channels and platforms.  NORTH ASIA The North Asian region is a diverse market that consists of some of the biggest markets for MakerDAO: China, Korea, and Japan. For our strategy to be effective, each key market\u2019s approach needs to be specific and tailored to that market. The regulatory landscape regarding crypto also varies widely. While each country has a different culture and languages, the unit\u2019s contributors can create synergies by sharing successful initiatives and resources.  Localize content, including Maker websites, to effectively reach the  audience Manage local social media channels and chatrooms to help potential users understand Boost social media followers such as Twitter and Facebook Combine marketing campaigns with easy-step challenges to make learning easy and interesting Provide local content via mainstream/social media, blogs, on/off-line events, etc.  SOUTHEAST ASIA Southeast Asia has a very diverse cultural and regulatory landscape. Singapore is a significant crypto hub in Japan, with one of the more lax SEA markets for crypto-specific regulations. The focus on the region will be on Vietnam and the Philippines because they are ranked top 10 in global remittance in fiat remittances.  Localize content and increase awareness of MakerDAO and Dai Utilize ambassador program to build and build and strengthen local communities   Approach The list below contains a list of approaches the unit utilizes depending on the needs for each region. Communications/Content  Provide clear messaging and communicate effectively with mainstream media Create value through PR strategies, including earned media from reputable online news outlets, YouTube channels, and podcasts Be the point of contact for the mainstream media  Marketing and Social Media  Conduct marketing campaigns to raise the awareness of Dai Manage the official social media platforms for MakerDAO such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook Promote latest partnerships with Growth Unit and other teams Coordinate with other core units and the community in promoting Dai  Events  Strategize our event involvement (virtual & in-person) Assess event sponsorship opportunities and commit resources to those aligned with our strategy Personal participation at the most relevant events to represent MakerDAO and strengthen our network Expand offline presence through local events (directly, via partners, or ambassadors) Provide lead generation for Growth or other CUs  Localization  Calibrate our strategy to match the needs, culture, and the stage of Dai awareness in specific regions Use the most popular social media and communication channels to establish and grow local communities and run local campaigns Translate content (video, text, etc.) about MakerDAO in key markets Collaborate with those who share the same vision with MakerDAO, including local institutions, associations, and advocates Identify local passionate and talented MakerDAO supporters and onboard them as ambassadors  Market Research and Analysis  Research and analyze data gathered to gauge the effectiveness of the unit and adjust as needed Gather sentiment around Maker and Dai and convey it to the DAO   Deliverables This unit plans to adopt the Objective-Key-Results (OKRs) approach to achieve its goals. The objectives set for the units will come with a couple of key results that are to be determined as we gain more visibility with the existing data. In order to ensure our unit\u2019s strategy is aligned with other units, the discussions with other core units on identifying their needs will be important in creating our deliverables. Another factor in determining deliverables is team members. As new members of our units are being added, strategies and deliverables will be an ongoing discussion for the first couple of months. Based on our discussion so far, deliverables include, but not limited to the following:  Identify and create value proposition for each key market segments Research and explore opportunities in developing markets in Africa and LatAM where financial services may be lagging Activation of an ambassador program: planning, proof of concept, adjust, implementation Quarterly marketing campaigns and ads   People Individuals on this team come with extensive experience in marketing, PR, communications, and community building. Some of the team members are part of MakerDAO community who have been advocates and contributors in the past years.  Their area of expertise includes outreach through events and marketing campaigns. They have built communities and localized educational content in key markets. Communicating with potential users in the language they speak underscores the spirit of MakerDAO as an inclusive organization. They have effectively shared their knowledge about Maker through various speaking engagements and social media.

What I have observed from Maker\u2019s efforts to reach a wider audience is that it so far appears to be more education than marketing. It is rational to the extreme. There is imho already more than sufficient quality Youtube vids explaining Dai and Maker. Also the noise level is so low that you could almost expect Maker to be a sort of secret nightclub where you can only get in if you know where it is. So what I have yet to see is playing to the emotional aspects of crypto and an increase in the volume. Hodled like BTC Petted like Doge Pumped like Nano Stampede evaluation like Uniswap Also I so far miss the megaphone aspect of marketing The influencers The namedropping Covert rumor production General FOMO spraying You might choose to stop right before enlisting \u2018Too hot to handle\u2019 celebs but Russian propaganda mills should seriously be considered.

It could be by talking with every CEX or DEX to have Dai in different markets (some of these exchanges could decide to list Dai by themselves. With others -most of them- we have to create a joint strategy to generate a Dai market), or by developing use cases where Dai is the right solution for a challenge (like NGOs receiving donations in countries with a regime). In any case, our job is to understand the market, proactively reach out to potential partners, pitch them why Maker is what they need, and in a consultative way, help them to create solutions based on the Maker Protocol. Part of our job is to educate, not because we want everyone to be an expert about how the protocol works, but because we need to show our potential partners why they should choose Maker over other protocols/stablecoins. Growth unit\u2019s focus is on the B2B relationship (with companies, protocols, projects, governments, etc.) and how they can use the Maker protocol to reach more users. ",

What have you done exactly? \u2192 As many people have no idea of what you have done, your action might have been not so visible. If, for instance, some of your candidate Core Unit contributors have appeared in TV talking about MakerDAO in S-Korea, not many people have here have watched the show. Have this TV-appearance brought millions of S-Koreans to MakerDAO? Please inform us on this type of results. What \u2018strategy\u2019 have you been following in the past, which can be extended to the future? Sentences like:      Kathleen:  I don\u2019t see MakerDAO like any other crypto projects       Kathleen:  Education is a way to lower that entry barrier so others feel comfortable joining.   suggest that you have a vision/strategy.

I certainly want to evaluate and assess what can be done to achieve the best results   Make me feel like the strategy is not yet determined, or at least is very shaky. So, really, it\u2019s hard to vote on approving (or not) your proposal if we don\u2019t know what great things you have done for MakerDAO in the past and what you plan (precisely) to do in the future.

Note that the success has limited to Japan, and it can be easily tweaked for and adopted by the global market. Please also check these hashtags because then you can see how they resonate with people. July 2020 One\u2019s favorite food campaign - one\u2019s favorite food in Japanese is Daikoubutsu. We ran this campaign after the restaurants started to reopen after the first wave of the pandemic. We asked people to show their support for their favorite restaurants by posting pictures of their favorite food on social media and the name of the restaurant and tag to #dai\u597d\u7269 (DAIkoubutsu). The participants got Dai in return. Then we shared how Dai can be used. Results: *1,400% surge of visits to our blog page for the campaign period. *The campaign generated 62.8K impressions on the campaign\u2019s tweets and replies, while #dai\u597d\u7269 had 251K impressions. September 2020 Where\u2019s Dai? (or dokoDAI) This campaign invites people to find or create things that consist of Dai or something that includes dai sound. We ask them to tweet it and tag it to #dokoDAI. After that, as a token of appreciation, we put all the submissions into a mosaic DAI. Results: The hashtag #\u3069\u3053DAI reached at least 160K of Impressions. November 2020 Haikudaikai: We collaborated with the biggest crypto news outlet in Japan and ran a haiku competition. *Number of new sessions/visits to our blog more than doubled\t *The hashtag #\u4ff3\u53e5DAI\u4f1a reached at least 67K of Impressions.     flipflopflapdelegate:  And I often wonder what we as a Community can do to get more traction.

But quite aside from Maker being positioned (so far) as a best-practice leader in the space in every respect, do we think shady marketing is going to be sustainable?

As one of the main DeFi target audience for now (white male in his 30s), I would maybe suggest you focus your attention on continuing to grow this market %.

What I am saying is that using emotional means to reach and hold the attention of people can be highly effective. There is no denying that good crypto is hodled long and lovingly, petted and codled,  shielded against critics and rooted for like a sports team. Should we achieve the same for DAI and MKR it would be incredible. Making emotional arguments is not     Cassius:  shady marketing   it is a vital part of the human experience.  And therefore popular. And what is wrong with memes? Memes are a highly effective method of communicating, combining art and humor to get the message across.     Cassius:  Russian propaganda farms   RT (for example) has a ton of viewers, they are probably dirt cheap and you do not have to do anything illegal. If it is aired in a jurisdiction where it is legal, it is reasonably to assume Youtube and the financial-independent-retire-early squad will handle the rest of the distribution for you. So aired somewhere, distributed everywhere.     Cassius:  Last cycle saw some major casualties as regulators caught up with DeFi projects that had taken a lowest common denominator approach to marketing.   Yes.

And we are not going to do that. I am not a marketing guy myself. I could not sell icecream in Sahara. Marcomms strategy of not playing to emotions could possibly be the right choice for Maker, I don\u2019t know. But I am observing that groups sometimes use emotional marketing to great effect, and I am asking why Maker is not considering this. Back in 2014 what was the first thing I ever heard about Litecoin? \u201cBitcoin is gold, Litecoin is silver\u201d. Still memorable. What changes did they make to the hashing algoritm?

If you\u2019re right on this, then I beg to differ, that is a wrong target! Infact, MakerDAO is on a global growth-path to solve the fundamental problems of every place that deem necessary. Especially with the existing monetary system, which the African region is not fit for purpose. I believe that, with the right promotion, no other place can achieve higher demand for Dai than Africa. This is a continent that still has a lot of broken financial systems that can potentially be solved by Dai. While crypto looks like a luxury for other places, it\u2019s a lifeline for Africans. Africans using traditional currencies are often faced with high transaction costs, inflation and currency devaluations, exorbitant interest rates and high levels of fraud. Coupled with all this - accessing the existing system (despite the fact that many have a mobile phone and conduct other elements of their lives online) is still incredibly restrictive. This has in turn led to a lack of financial inclusion and huge unbanked deposits in the region, which does not help Africans and severely hampers economic growth and financial freedom in this region. For Africans, DAI will be life changing for many millions here. The main barrier has been the lack of effective education, which this unit intends to provide. For the huge unbanked population and those that lose out every time they deal with the existing financial services sector, Dai can provide them a better way of moving, storing and exchanging value. MakerDAO is at the forefront of bringing this inevitable change to Africa in a responsible way with a unit like the Strategic Marcom Unit. We can\u2019t therefore be looking to make the largest impact, when we neglect other regions such as Africa. ",

That is not to say that Africa will not play an enormous role in the future, I was merely trying to illustrate the objective reality that I see to focus on those with the most capital/access to the current paradigm. I am happy to be wrong in my assessment of the current landscape and do truly look forward to MakerDAO having a more prominent global outreach to every demographic and empowering the lives of every individual. My only point (perhaps naively) was to ensure a strong North American strategy (because you don\u2019t have one right now, which is kind of shocking to be honest) as I believe in the short term will bear the most fruit.

After many years, a big brand presence, and a strong investment, Jumia Pay is around $200M transaction annually. Not sure how that would compare to DAI inventory but it\u2019s hard to get excited.   Sure. I think my earlier comment mentioned some primary value propositions for Dai in Africa. I expect that the following will further answer your question. The unique value proposition of Dai in Africa is that it enables the storage and transfer of economic value devoid of extreme volatility, geopolitical restrictions within African nations, and censorship. Though other stablecoins exist, not all can offer these benefits. Specific instances of this broad value proposition include, among many other use cases, highly secure storage of value, financial inclusion, cross-border remittances, and a better investment opportunity. The entire market size for crypto is still nascent, especially in Africa, this presents a chance for us to penetrate well. In line with the core unit mandate, I hope to cover at least 20% of the market size with the word of Dai in a year, imbibing their attention with Dai and increasing adoption. This is possible with the unit\u2019s broad strategy of adopting the best approaches most likely to achieve results. They include, events, PR programs - news outlets, social media, blog etc. word of mouth and intensive local activism. With the issue of Jumia pay, that\u2019s a different service platform with different value propositions to Dai imo. This platform works under the legacy financial system and competes with big telecom companies like MTN, Vodafone and Tigocash which all provide similar services like mobile money, paying for bills, airtime etc. Of course, their transaction magnitude is tied to how well they compete with these companies.

Knowing your model of how things are will not only help understanding the reasons behind your plans, but it will also help relate the different growth&communication initiatives to one another so everything can fit together in the end.   Yes. Let me share it here. Maker is well known in the crypto space. That has brought our focus to reaching out to new users  in the past couple of years. The visits to our homepage gained 34 percent and new users accounted for a third in 2020. (That\u2019s as much as I can share regarding data.) It is achieved through community building, educational events, and various marketing channels including content, social media, marketing campaigns, and partnerships. Our well established track record and reputation, in addition to PR activities, were vital when it comes to media coverage by crypto media and traditional media. However, due to regulatory uncertainties in some jurisdictions, the global marketing plan faced some challenges in implementation. All the marketing activities were pursued with awareness of the regulatory environment and in a legally conservative way. I expect those challenges to remain even after the foundation is dissolved. That is why about 10 percent of our budget has been allocated to legal consultation. We need to have a team that understands both the opportunities and challenges we face. Based on a SWOT analysis we have put together, one can see that even though Dai captures all the advantages of blockchain, its growth has lagged behind centralized stablecoin. Without a more aggressive approach, it could potentially put us further behind others. This can be tackled in many fronts, including collaboration of CUs such as RWA, Growth, and this Strategic Marcomms MIP put forward. With Strategic Marcomms CU, our focus will be on becoming more active in jurisdictions where Dai has gained legal status, while seeking ways to expand our PR activities in countries where legality remains in question. Boosting our visibility while navigating the complexity will be our main focus. Being more active means  An increase in marketing and ads spending for channels we identify as key for our targeted audience Boosting visibility through earned, as well as paid media, utilizing PR agencies  Putting regional specifics aside, key strategy for our unit will include the following:  Finding narratives that connect with our targeted users and align with their values through branding, content, PR, and messaging (social media, ads) Highlighting benefits that our targeted users deem most important and valuable through events, content, and messaging Lowering the entry barriers for new potential users by hosting events, community building, PR, and educational content  ",

The strategy I have chosen for the market I cover includes:  Increasing the awareness of MakerDAO, Dai and DeFi through educational content and meetups. Engaging conversations with regulators. Conducting marketing campaigns on social media that connect with people.  In the case of Japan, social media such as Twitter is the place to be for Japanese crypto users, and running campaigns on such a platform means that anyone can easily participate and connect on an emotional level. Another example is community building. Others on the team, including Sahabia, are long-term community members passionate about MakerDAO. That shows in the way they build their communities from the ground up by running workshops and educational events, in addition to managing chatrooms on different platforms. (A couple of team members prefer to be anonymous till the unit is voted in.) Those are just a couple of examples. The strategy has to be adjusted depending on the legal climate and how well Maker is known for regions where we expect higher growth and ROI. ",

I would be more than happy to go over the strategy more in detail when I present them during a community call. A majority of key markets that we should focus on have already been included in the proposal. We plan to modify the proposal to address and clarify some great points raised by you and some others in the community. Here are more detailed answers for your questions: Target audience groups:   Crypto users who haven\u2019t used Dai   Those in the financial sector and the technology sector with a basic understanding of the critical components of open finance or DeFi   Target market:   Region experiencing hyperinflation in their countries such as LATAM   Region of a large population with mobile, but no bank account such as Africa   Those living in countries with near-zero interest rates such as the euro-zone and Japan   Regions with a substantial remittance need such as Southeast Asia and LATAM   The world\u2019s three-biggest economies where we can gain the advantage of economies of scale can be achieved more effectively: the U.S., China, and Japan       Planet_X:  And what was the framework given to you by the foundation?   Regarding the framework given by the foundation, I don\u2019t have the authority to talk about that. If you like to hear what I have done, then I would be more than happy to share. I believe I have also provided some highlights of my work already. Keep in mind that I am submitting this proposal as part of a community member who is keen to contribute, not as someone representing the foundation.     Planet_X:  How about the framework from Legal? Can you talk about that?   I am afraid I can\u2019t speak on behalf of Legal. There are many things I have learned as a former financial journalist and as a marketer. I understand that we must set aside a budget for legal to ensure that what we do is legally sound.     PaperImperium:  Out of curiosity, what share of the remittance market does DAI have? I\u2019d think we\u2019d be perfect for that, with the only fees being gas and local currency conversion. It would tie a lot of markets together, too \u2014 with N Am and Europe adopting so they can send to Lat Am, Africa, Philippines, India, etc.   There is no such data available, but utilizing major use cases would be the way to go indeed.     Cassius:  I feel that some simple written/video resources (with all the necessary disclaimers and legal advice) would be hugely valuable. How many people don\u2019t know what @PaperImperium describes above? How many people would act differently if they did?   Indeed. I agree. ",

Awareness, social media engagement, and availability for media contact are all things that aren\u2019t easy to measure in terms of output and actual impact. Will there be a reported number of deals with some entities that will also have a measured impact in terms of DAI transactions or volume?   Who is the target audience? My understanding is that Growth is targeting integrations (not to say you couldn\u2019t as well). Marcomms is targeting\u2026 people we want to open vaults? Integrations to accept DAI? Mid-stream \u201cdistributors\u201d like Instadapp or DeFiSaver that push our product for us? Who exactly is the focus?   For PR and media contact, where is the \u201cvision\u201d going to come from so that we stay on message. There\u2019s a certain tension between Maker-to-democratize-finance message and the Maker-as-central-bank/DAI-as-a-building-block message. How do those get resolved when someone from the media presses us for an \u201cofficial\u201d statement?   Thanks in advance!

                    "content": "Thanks for your questions @PaperImperium. I appreciate your interest in finding out more about our unit. About easily measured deliverables, you have raised a good point. Let me explain how we plan to tackle that issue. Our unit utilizes a set of OKRs, which is an objective-focused method accompanying key results to help us to focus on what really matters. As listed in the proposal, two top objectives for the Strategic Marcomms unit are to 1) increase the awareness of Dai and the Maker Protocol and 2) boost Dai adoption through promotions and partnerships. To achieve the above objectives, we focus on the customer journey from Awareness, Interest, Desire to Action. We track key results in each stage of the journey, such as page views from earned or paid media, growth of visits to websites and blogs, social media, and marketing campaign engagement. The timing of an increase in traffic is one way to see the effect of our activities. For example, we can measure the outcome by looking at the correlation between the timing of a marketing campaign and an increase in website visits. There are other ways to measure the impact such as URL tracking. In addition to the deliverables we have listed in the proposal, a number of key results will be considered and set once the team gets a chance to access and evaluate the historical data of MakerDAO\u2019s homepage and blog. Regarding the unit\u2019s target audience, we have identified them, as well as key markets in our updated proposal. Please have a look and let us know what you think. Basically, our target audience is mainly potential users who are likely to use DAI and the Maker Protocol to protect their assets or earn interest rates. As a marketing unit, we will also work with other units such as the Growth unit or the RWA unit in helping them to achieve their goals by increasing the visibility of Dai and the Maker protocol among potential partners, so that when the teams approach these prospects for partnership or collaboration discussions, they already know who we are. As to your question on PR and media, like you have mentioned, the topic of vision is still in discussion. Our unit, consisting of members with PR or journalism background who understand the organization\u2019s current status, is best to communicate that clearly to the media when being pressed for comment. Regarding media inquiries, our unit will ensure they speak to the right facilitator or community member involved depending on the topics. The PR component of the unit also focuses on messaging, value proposition, trend research, and media training. ",
