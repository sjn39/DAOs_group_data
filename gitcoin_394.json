The token drop experience will come to an end Wednesday June 23rd, 2021. If the mobile issues you\u2019re experiencing are related to the token drop (especially if they are preventing you from claiming tokens), it might be better to explore a workaround.  I know that we do have users that have successfully claimed from mobile so we might just need to find a phone/browser/wallet combo that works for you. On the other hand, some of the re-playable missions like changing stewards could persist past the initial distribution.  For those missions I think it would make sense to dial in more through mobile support. However, I think there is a desire to decentralize these missions in the future too so we should keep that in mind. I wonder if @phutchins might have some ideas about mobile support moving forward especially in regards to a decentralized QL? ",
