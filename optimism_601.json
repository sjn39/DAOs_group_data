                    "content": "Basic Details Project name: Tenzing Author name and forum name (please provide a reliable point of contact for the project): Francesco Piccoli L2 recipient address: 0x34Cdbc575f2CBAfFbF286D6f987fd32FC62Ae049 Which Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 11 I confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders Sub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited to be reviewed by the Builders Sub-Committee: [Yes/No]: Yes Project Details What are you going to build?: An open-source Smart Contract Catalog for the Optimism blockchain. Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?: Right now, launching a web3 project is fairly difficult, regardless of whether we\u2019re talking about an NFT project, a Soulbound Token Project, or a DeFi application. This Smart Contract Catalog addresses pain points in this process, including significantly reducing the time and cost in coding of smart contracts and smart contract auditing. Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Yes. As mentioned, launching a web3 project is fairly difficult and time consuming. The Smart Contract Catalog streamlines the process of coding and auditing smart contracts, allowing developers to not only spend time on other critical areas of project development, but also by cutting the cost of conducting a security audit before deploying onto the Optimism blockchain. Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Yes. We will provide a catalog of audited smart contracts, which gives developers access to smart contracts that adhere to industry best practices. This raises the bar of overall code quality on the Optimism blockchain. Is your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Yes. The greater the variety of developer tools accessible within the Optimism ecosystem, the greater the ease and efficiency with which developers can construct and implement applications on Optimism. By doing this you heighten the sense of loyalty towards the Optimism ecosystem. Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Demo: https ://drive.google.com/file/d/14fkcUMervXh2coV6I0R3x65ZluokQr1D/view?usp=sharing Website: https://anchain.ai/  Twitter: @AnChainAI  Github: @AnChainAI  Other:  Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred: please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): The product is still in beta. We are primarily focused on testing and iterating upon the product, gathering feedback from beta testers, and data analysis that will inform our metrics. We are committed to using these metrics and feedback to guide our development process and create a high-quality product that meets the needs of Optimism developers. Who are your competitors?  Thirdweb Zerocode NFT Justmint  What differentiates you from your competitors?: Our team of experts have an unparalleled level of experience in blockchain security, having worked with some of the largest and most complex blockchain systems in the world.

That ranges from on-chain anti-money laundering checks and fraud detectionBEI, CISO,SCREEN to smart contract security audits. I understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained [Yes/No]: Yes Is your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has: Our project has been through three rounds of funding, providing us with a healthy runway of around 24 months. This funding has been critical in supporting our ongoing efforts to advance and achieve our project goals. Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 50k How do you justify the size of the grant?: The grant helps us cover research, development costs, and maintenance for our open-source smart contract catalog, as well as the hiring and training of engineers and developer advocates with expertise in the Optimism blockchain. We plan for this to be an ongoing effort where we actively work with partners in the Optimism ecosystem to expand and update the catalog. Roadmap Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project:  Extensive research on the nuances of the Optimism blockchain . Develop the infrastructure for the smart contract catalog covering multiple use cases. Create at least 2 smart contracts for the first 2 supported categories (NFTs, SBTs). Conduct comprehensive security audits on those contracts. Open-source the catalog to the Optimism ecosystem. Create at least 2 smart contracts for other 2 supported categories (DeFi, GameFi). Work with partners in the ecosystem to narrow down the most relevant and needed use cases for DeFi and GameFi. Conduct comprehensive security audits on those contracts. Work with at least 1 partner in the Optimism ecosystem to jointly develop another smart contract standard.  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): N/A Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: : While the success of our plan is not solely dependent on the receipt of OP tokens, their contribution would certainly enhance our efforts and help us achieve our goals more efficiently. OP tokens would bring unique benefits and advantages to the table, like access to a range of financial instruments, reduced transaction costs, and participation in DAO governance. What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?: Our plan after the 1 year lock-up is to allocate the OP tokens towards research and development efforts aimed at improving the platform\u2019s capabilities and introducing new OP features that will enable us to better serve the needs of our users. We will focus on gathering user feedback and conducting market research to identify areas where the platform can be improved, and then invest in developing new features and functionality to address those needs. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project.
