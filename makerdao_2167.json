Paragraph Summary MIP41c5-SP14 voluntarily offboards @Primoz as Facilitator of the Risk Core Unit (RISK-001). If MIP41c4-SP41 passes, the facilitation of the @Risk-Core-Unit will be handed over to BA Labs, an LLC represented by @Risk-Core-Unit members @rema and @monet-supply.  Specification  Motivation It has been about two years since I became one of MakerDAO\u2019s first-ever Core Unit Facilitators. Since then, I have done my job with passion, while still being aware of the huge responsibilities that the Risk Core Unit Facilitator role entails. Last year was particularly stressful, but we managed to get through this ecosystem crisis unscratched thanks to our conservative stance that I have tried to maintain since I joined this project in early 2019. I still remember the Lisbon conference 2021 in the middle of the bull market when certain people were pitching our team to become more risk-taking and potentially start adopting \u201cnew DeFi 2.0 concepts\u201d, as otherwise we\u2019d become irrelevant. We all know what happened months following this hype - FEI, MIM, and similar projects are more or less dead, while DAI is still the largest decentralized stablecoin because DAI holders value safety on both the smart contract and collateral level. The reasons for my voluntary offboarding as Facilitator are twofold. The first reason is that I have had this function for a long time, and I want to pass along the opportunity to new talents that I have been able to attract to Risk in the last few years. I believe that @rema and @monet-supply are the best combination for the Maker Protocol risk facilitation. They are both smart, know every detail of where risk at Maker may be hiding, have a similar conservative stance as myself, and are constantly monitoring the Maker Protocol collateral portfolio. The second reason for my departure is simply personal. The function does take a toll on you, especially after 2022, which was quite stressful, despite me knowing Maker is very well hedged. Managing ten people and being in alert mode all the time can be quite challenging. This is why I want to focus more on managing the team, deal less with governance and focus more on other interesting Maker-related projects in the pipeline. The exact timing of effective offboarding depends on our proposal in RFC (or any other potential Risk Facilitator onboarding proposals), which will onboard the limited liability company, BA Labs, as the new @Risk-Core-Unit facilitator, represented by @rema and @monet-supply.
