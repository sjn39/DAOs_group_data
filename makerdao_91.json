To say the least we are all very uninformed on this topic and don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s possible?  Would anybody be able to educate or help us understand if this is a possibility?  A typical solar install is @ 35k USD and is secured via lien on the residence.  With the new federal incentives coming we feel setting this up would be a game changer, we just don\u2019t know if it can be done \u2026. ",

Happy to have my team work on your project post-application. ",

I actually wanted to offer to partner with Maker if they are up to it. Looking for partnerships right now. DeFi or otherwise. Also my brother builds homes and wants them to be solar ready so we went over a lot of solar ideas just a few weeks ago. I want to set up a wind generator on my farm but I\u2019m tempted by solar even with freezing and dark winters here. I personally run a tech company and have contacts if you need any development work or contacts. Love solar and want to help basically. ",
