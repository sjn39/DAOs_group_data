This thread serves as a discussion forum for Optimism\u2019s Operating Manual v0.2 v0.2 has been drafted to address feedback we\u2019ve heard from the community over the course of Season 1, as outlined in Governance Update #2. The full diff of the manual can be found on GitHub here. A brief summary of those changes can be found below:  Changelog  Changes two-week voting cycles to a three-week voting cadence:  Week 1: Community feedback Week 2: Delegate review Week 3: Snapshot vote  Summary for proposal authors  Optimism has a three-week proposal review cycle. Before getting started: gut-check your idea in the #gov-temp-check channel in Discord. When you\u2019re ready, draft a proposal and post it on the Forum with [Draft] in the title for feedback from the community. When you\u2019re ready for formal review from Token House delegates, update [Draft] to [Review]. You are expected to have made an effort to get community feedback before submitting for formal review. During the next Review Week (every three weeks), delegates will provide feedback on your proposal. Use your judgment to incorporate feedback. Once your proposal has been approved for a vote by two delegates with >0.5% of voting supply, you may add a link to your proposal to the Voting Cycle Roundup thread. The proposal will be automatically added to Snapshot during the next one-week voting window. If your proposal is passed, the Optimism Foundation will distribute the approved funding. Note the Foundation may be in touch to collect additional information from your project in order to execute the grant. If your proposal fails, you can make a new proposal in the next cycle specifying how you have incorporated significant changes from your first proposal.     Increases number of delegate approvals for a proposal to move to a vote from one to two delegates Defines \u201cvotable OP supply\u201d as \u201cthe total amount of OP that has been delegated, and therefore can participate in voting\u201d Adds that transparency into OP votable supply will be included in each Voting Roundup Thread Adds \u201cwithout explicit delegate approval, proposals will not move to a Snapshot vote\u201d - Adds \u201cdelegates cannot approve their own proposal\u201d Clarifies rules for proposal re-submission Removes old proposal guidelines for Phase 0 GovFund proposals Adds \u201cCommittee Creation\u201d proposal type Adds links to Phase 1 GovFund template Changes quorum from 10% to 30% of votable supply for all proposal types Changes the approval threshold for Protocol Upgrades from 51% to 76% Adds mention of future Delegate Code of Conduct Adds administration rights to remove duplicate proposals Changes OPerating Manual to Operating Manual Changes table headers for formatting clarify Adds new TLDR for voting process   Discussion This thread will remain open until the end of the Reflection Period. While these changes do not need approval by the Token House via a formal Snapshot vote, the Optimism Foundation welcomes your feedback to help craft a voting process that works for delegates, proposal authors, and involved community members. The Operating Manual v0.2 will go into effect at the beginning of Season 2 on September 8 with the kickoff of Voting Cycle #6. ",

More substantive comments below   Small request about this, potentially for a future season:   For a proposal to proceed to Week 3 (voting), two delegates with >0.5% of the current votable token supply must give explicit approval on the discussion thread. Delegates may signal this approval by pasting the comment on the proposal discussion thread: \u201dI am an Optimism delegate [link to your delegate commitment] with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.\"  It would be nice to have easy to link cards showing delegates\u2019 voting power rather than the thread. The Optimism website already has this info here. I think all that\u2019s missing would be to make individual delegate cards linkable.  Re: \u201cThe total votable OP supply will be determined based on a reasonable estimate provided by the Optimism Foundation prior to each Voting Cycle.\u201d  It would be nice if there was somewhere (even if just a .md file or thread here) keeping track of the votable OP supply per Voting Cycle   Re: the Approval Thresholds, it\u2019s a bit odd to me that \u201cProtocol Upgrade\u201d doesn\u2019t have the highest threshold, similar to \u201cInflation Adjustment\u201d (which can be thought of as a protocol upgrade in a way) or \u201cDirector Removal\u201d.   Re: this     If it is not, the Foundation may remove the proposal for resubmission or cause the proposal to be implemented with certain guardrails, in its discretion, and coupled with an explanation to the Collective as to why the proposal was rejected or limited.   It would be nice if the OF could commit to when possible/on a best-effort basis/assuming no legal risks/etc. proactively giving this feedback to proposal authors and the community more broadly so that potential solutions/tweaks may be considered during the Voting Cycle.
