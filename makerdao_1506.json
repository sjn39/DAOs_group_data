                    "content": "Hello again everyone. So it looks like the uptake on USDC as collateral has been very strong, so strong in fact that @cyrus  is worried that we will not have enough liquidity available for auctions. This issue was touched upon in today\u2019s governance and risk meeting, but to lay it out simply: The main goal of onboarding USDC as collateral was to provide keepers access to liquidity for the coming FLOP auctions (as well as any unexpected FLIP auctions.) Apparently (and unfortunately, sort of) much of the debt ceiling is being used by people arbitraging the Dai peg rather than keepers stocking up for auctions.  Given this is the case, we have a few options that I can see: 1. Increase the stability fee on the USDC-A collateral package to discourage peg arbitrage.  Pro: Allow the remainder of the debt ceiling space to be used by keepers for auctions, and may cause peg arbitrageurs to close their positions. Con: Will probably annoy those users that have been using USDC-A to arbitrage the peg.  2. Increase the debt ceiling on the USDC-A collateral package to allow more room for keepers to create Dai liquidity during the auctions.  Pro: Provides more liquidity for auctions. Con: May still get eaten up by peg arbitrageurs. Con: We add more blacklist and regulatory risk to the system.  3. Add an additional USDC collateral package (USDC-B) with a higher Stability fee that should only be used by keepers due to the prohibitive cost over periods longer than six hours. Optionally, also reduce the debt ceiling on USDC-A.  Pro: Provides more liquidity for auctions which cannot be used by peg arbitrageurs. Con: We add more blacklist and regulatory risk to the system. Unless we also lower the ceiling on USDC-A by an amount equal to the new debt ceiling on USDC-B.   ",

The whole point of the USDC vaults should be peg stability. A shock absorber that can be tapped when there\u2019s a big need for DAI lqiudiity. Though, even with the goal of peg stability, you want to have room in the debt ceiling when there\u2019s an actual shock in demand, sort of like the use case cyrus mentioned. So that means that the SF needs to be priced at a point where it\u2019s mainly used for shocks in the system. I support option 3, adding another collateral package USDC-B with a very high SF so that it\u2019ll only be used for peg stability in extreme situations. Also, it might still be a good idea to also slightly adjust USDC-A parameters. A 130% collateralization rate or 25% sf could be possible. ",

I think your 10 10 split makes sense in the current state @LongForWisdom. We got a benefit from USDC-A, now if we can close the space in USDC-A while opening USDC-B with the high stability fee maybe keepers will have to use USDC-B, if there is any debt ceiling space they would use the option with the lower SF right? unless maybe if we have a lower CR on USDC-B, letting keepers take more leverage. This is getting really complicated though. I am trying to contribute, but I just don\u2019t understand this stuff well enough. I am concerned about how few people have a really good grasp on all this. Cyrus and co are amazing, I really hope they can get rest, burnout of the risk team is a serious risk to the protocol. Repeated intense stress/little sleep will lead to worse cognitive function no matter how smart they are. ",

An arbitrager will mint DAI using USDC and sell it on the market, which will source liquidity.

IMO, the SF of USDC-A should be lowered to be competitive to the dYdX rates in order to see real down pressure from the USDC collateral. Let\u2019s make a simple calculation. The current price of DAI is $1.02. If you leverage short 4x on dYdX and the peg goes down to $1 in 1 week: 10000 DAI short position, requires ~$2600 collateral. You borrow 10k DAI at %7. The interest will be around 13-14DAI + ~6USDC in fees and your profit will be 8% = 800USDC. Net profit of $780. The bad part is that you don\u2019t really mint new DAI with this. If you want to do the same using USDC CDP, you will need to pay 35-36 interest and you will need 15000 USDC to borrow that much DAI. Given that I am not sure why would anyone use USDC CDPs for shorting DAI. May be I am missing something\u2026 For the arb to work with CDPs, the SF need to be lowered to less than %7. ",

This is beneficial because it gives the market time to stabilise, and time for more bullish ETH holders to generate more Dai through ETH-backed CDPs. ",
