Unfortunately after reading it, I\u2019m not happy with how it ended up. I\u2019ve checked all sentences and sadly this is %100 google translate where some sentences don\u2019t have a meaning.  (+Nash equilibria part is not translated at all) Thanks to GitcoinGR13, our project was able to sow seeds in 5 different regions with many other benefits.  Personally, I am not looking for any bounty, but feel responsible for giving back to the community by correcting the poor translation of the book with our team before the distribution to reach Turkish readers. The subject is not easy for all, and I\u2019d suggest it could be better to reach readers with correct sentences rather than google translate. (Better late than poor translation?) Waiting on your opinions. Thank you ",

I\u2019m only new here on forums, but I know we have the brightest minds in the universe as developers here on Gitcoin; isn\u2019t there a program/system to check if translations have been done with -only- google translate?
