The added value of Circle is to provide an overcollateralized loan with Bitcoin. To access Circle\u2019s yield account, the lender (MakerDAO) must be an incorporated entity to pass through KYC and sign the Line of Credit Agreement.  image724\u00d7522 50.9 KB  Some questions raised after our conversation with Circle:  If we lend them 1B USDC, does that change the yield? \u2192 No, scaling won\u2019t change the terms. The Genesis market is massive. Do we want to incorporate a company to lend USDC? If so, what should be the next steps?  We also talked with Syndicate Protocol. Syndicate is helping companies (VCs) to create DAOs to manage their investments through a DAO. During this process, they developed a framework to create legally compliant DAOs for sharing equity. Now they want to work with DAOs to help them to be more compliant and allow them to interact with the off-chain world:  They can help DAOs to set up entities with on-chain ownership. These entities can have access to different service from the TradFi world (like a bank account) They work with DAOs to help them to diversify their treasury, opening brokerage accounts to invest their crypto funds in instruments that protect them from inflation, like bonds.

What percentage of our USDC holdings would they allow us to invest?   Considering there is a higher rate based on the length of the term, what term are they advising we consider.

This is not a problem that Alameda has. And despite Alameda, I still am inclined to believe most of their money is going to CeFi and TradFi where liquidity needs still dwarf DeFi. Quite simply, I do not believe that the r/r entailed with DeFi are compatible with our needs (competitive & fixed rates, minimized risks, or harmless to our own business). This all could (and frankly probably will) change within the next twelve months as the space continues rapidly growing and brings new DeFi products that meet our needs and/or raise rates that are commensurate with the risks. In the meantime, if we want to keep everything decentralized there still may be viable opportunities that don\u2019t harm our own products, like perhaps insurance. I\u2019m not sure. Regardless I still think it\u2019s a far superior solution to go with a fixed 4% rate through CeFi that can absorb billions without tanking DeFi money markets. All while incurring minimal additional risk beyond those entailed with holding billions of Circle\u2019s stablecoin in the first place.     flipflopflapdelegate:  What about asking Goldman Sachs and the new crypto desk launched by Citibank\u2014I bet they offer higher yields on $1B. Also, don\u2019t let Circle pull the wool over your eyes\u2014high net worth individuals can always negotiate higher yields than the plebs \u2014 it\u2019s a fact. I mean 4% is nice\u2014but they should feel privileged that your core unit even consider them. Just keeping it real \u2014 you gotta have swagger    100% correct. We absolutely are in a position to demand the terms. There is zero chance that Circle has near as much raw capital power as we do right now. They are more or less at our mercy and we should negotiate accordingly. Not that advise it, but even the hint that we\u2019d switch out the USDC for, say, GUSD, would send them scrambling to make us happy customers. We are in a position to work out an arrangement that works to our benefit, whether that\u2019s higher rates or a different model of drawing yield from Circle altogether. As regards sentiments like this, which I myself often struggle with:     Zarevok:  I agree, a defi solution would definitely be more on brand for the DAO.   We need to remember that nowhere is there a rule-book that we must bend our decision making to match the ideological bent in which this all came to be. If anything, we should see working with traditional players as the obvious next step in the evolution of the decentralization revolution. We can and should work with the oldest, most established business or banking institutions out there if it benefits us and profits our organization. Doing so means we won; non-engagement is not viable and obstinacy in this regard is the achilles heel of DLT-based innovations. Nothing could be more on-brand than MakerDAO proving DAOs can operate billion dollar businesses with an efficacy rivaling the very best corporate executives out there. All in all, I\u2019m glad to see that we\u2019re at this point and I think we should strike while the iron is hot. An arrangement with Circle is a no-brainer imo. ",

As @Nadia mentioned, we\u2019re fascinated by the question of how DAOs can undergo KYC and want to help Maker navigate this uncharted territory. We have been busy researching ways to structure this. One possibility we\u2019re exploring is setting up a trust to hold the assets, and then designating a trustee to act on behalf of the community as their fiduciary. We have a few things to figure out, such as where this trust should be located for tax purposes. We\u2019ve received requests for Cayman and other locations.

With regards to this, would this be a good opportunity to potentially start to rebrand our main Dai as Dai-USD (or similar), at least on UIs and marketing material? Given there are several marketing CU proposals at the moment this could be a great opportunity for the DAO to start working on some key messaging around what Dai is, and surely help reinforce that we are talking about a USD pegged currency here as it\u2019s in the name - I think Nadia mentioned yesterday on the governance call that we always start at a disadvantage by not having USD in our name - doesn\u2019t have to be in the ticker per-se but we could at least reference it as so when we talk about the USD version. Also, I say USD version above because there are several references in this forum alone to EurDai, so even once we start to educate people that Dai is USD, a bit of their own research is going to lead them to discover that actually, Dai might also be Euro and any other currency that might crop up in conversation. It won\u2019t be long when Dai is not just USD and we will have to do something like this anyway IMO. Trying to do it sooner is always easier than later, as there are much fewer people to re-educate, and then it would seem new conversations around education and awareness building would be much easier.

Highlights of Miami -thanks to @Jenn and @Gustav_Arentoft -:   Meeting with Aave Pro to understand their product and what\u2019s needed to have Dai on that platform.   Meeting with Celcius, we talked about institutional vaults and CEL as collateral (they are willing to open a 100m DAI vault using CEL).   Meeting with Opera, they integrated Dai. It\u2019s in beta for now\u2026 and they are thinking about OptimismDai.   Meeting with Blockfi (more details coming soon)   Meeting with a gameverse, what do you think about having the \u201coffice hours\u201d in the Maker Bank (sci-fi style)? (more details coming soon)       Star-s- of the week      Korea   Bithumb, one of the largest Korean exchanges, listed Dai, and it\u2019s the first and only Stablecoin on there. Also, D\u2019CENT, a Korean hardware wallet, listed Klaytn Dai. Awesome job @joce_chang and @Doo_StableLab  LatAm+Gaming   Do you know that people from different countries play Axie for a living? In LatAm, Axie is a popular game in Argentina, Venezuela, and Brazil because it allows you to earn crypto while playing. Next week 256 Axie players will participate in the second Latin Axie Championship for a prize pool in Polygon Dai. We\u2019ve partnered with two Axie esports teams (Block Esports and Crit Theory Gaming), with Community Gaming to organize the tournament, and with Cryptorefills to incentivize the use of Polygon Dai inside their platform to buy Giftcards for games. KMANU88 will stream the tournament on his Twitch channel (+90k followers) and his youtube channel (+450k subscribers). Amazing job @Lozadaluis12 ",

I also would like to see included what is on L1/ETH against what is moving to L2. Interesting here was every network basically lost DAI with Polygon being the single grower here which in itself is a interesting piece of news. What I really want to see is whether on total DAI growth whether growth of DAI on L1 exceeded what is on L2. My points with the above is that the above report while interesting is not showing the total story of DAI but only the L2 one which only tells me what I already knew (Polygon being the hot L2 and everyone else staying still or losing to them).   I am more interested in the what the total DAI ecosystem is doing.   I would also be interested in seeing a report of how much DAI was static (just sitting somewhere) vs. being moved around but I think those are harder numbers to think about generating. ",
