Paragraph Summary [TBD]  Specification  Motivation SF-001 became increasingly more expensive without showing much value. A blurry mandate produces experiments that can be waste of time and risky projects.  \"We\u2019re building something here, Detective. We\u2019re buildingit from scratch. All the pieces matter.\u201d \u2014 Det. Lester Freamon   Too Expensive in Times of Crisis They advocate for bear market strategy and ask for cash like Cutty:   Latest DAI increase : \u2248+32%  MKR repricing : \u2248+270%  SF-001 is supposed to be exemplary, yet their MKR policy is the worst of all the CUs: no cap, no limit, 2-month average only.  Lack of Professionalism / Misuse of Funds The examples of their members behaving in bad faith (always with \u201cdata\u201d that would make a conspiracy theorist blush) are everywhere in the forum. Misuse of funds: In tradfi, using company funds granted for CU operations to buy shares will land you in jail \u2014 in Maker it\u2019s all good, it seems.  Lack of Results Things SF-001 did lately:  MIP40 amendment that changes dates to fit its own cycle. KPI suggestion. Lots of forum posting: Compared to other CUs, all the members hardly have time to do work. Lots of politics: @madshills confronted them and asked if the CU position was the official position since all the team was doing politics all the time.  Open source model. This is accountantspeak for a simple public spreadsheet. Lack of OKRs   Conclusion @aes alone was doing the same (productive) work before this CU became expensive. Now their updates look like GovComms\u2019, with no concrete result.  Core Unit ID SF-001 ",
