However, with the failing of SP63, preventing a public relations specialist hire, and our ongoing mandate redesign, that moves away from externally focused communications, we are no longer the best option for blog management. We do not believe it\u2019s in the DAO\u2019s best interest to leave the blog unused. We are willing to share our draft MIP with anyone interested in pursuing the role. We are bringing this to the community\u2019s attention because this matter is blocked from progressing. The options, as we see them, are:   Leave the blog unused. The status quo carries on until the stars line up.   Onboard a marketing CU who will eventually manage the blog. Conceptually, this is the best option. The caveat is the amount of time it will take for such a team to come about; Minimum, six months, maximum, unlimited.   Persuade Growth or Brand to take on this responsibility. May require the adjustment of mandate or budget.   Persuade GovComms to take on this responsibility. May require the adjustment of mandate or budget.       Which course of action do you believe is appropriate for the blog?  Leave the blog unused Onboard a marketing CU who will eventually manage the blog Persuade Growth or Brand to take on this responsibility Persuade GovComms to take on this responsibility Abstain     0 voters       Our View We believe the right course of action is to wait for a proper marketing team. Running the blog should require professional public relations oversight, which the DAO currently has no capacity for. The teams who currently come closest are the Growth CU and the incubating Brand CU. However, the responsibility seems out of scope for both in their current forms. ",

Despite this, I believe there is already plenty of specialized content being generated by CUs and the community in general, content that could be quickly put to use in this situation. Members from all over the world spark conversations and bring to the table all kinds of relevant news concerning MakerDAO. Regarding CUs, GovComms, for example, produces many summaries and tailored recaps of what is transpiring within the community every week. Even daily, I\u2019d dare to say. Why not select a few, design a series of recurrent categories for the Blog, and put this content out there? It could be a wonderful opportunity to let all this hard work shine for a broader audience. Surely we could think of this first step at reclaiming the Blog as a placeholder until we arrive at the desired destination. I also understand this would mean loading more work to teams that are probably functioning at the top of their capacity, and, given the characteristics of the crisis the DAO\u2013everyone\u2013is navigating, I tend to suspect there won\u2019t be proper compensation for said load. Sad, yes. Understandable too. Debatable? Of course. In favor of what I said above, utilizing what is already being produced with excellent quality by our CUs and community could be a good medium. As a member of the community and occasional contributor, I trust GovComms could take on such a task. But Growth is an apt candidate as well. It depends on the direction we are going for, I suppose. Is it only about communicating clearly and effectively? Then GovComms, sure. Is it about adoption and the generation of opportunities? It should be Growth. Do we want both? Why not work together! ",

We have an excess of information, for example, the Twitter account in both English and Spanish gives good quality information, the forum community gives a lot of quality information, the two candidates are good but before demanding that they carry out the task we should check if they have the enough space to enter that task on your work schedule. I don\u2019t want to eliminate the blog, it\u2019s a more organized way of giving information, but the only way is to make that blog address all types of audience regardless of language, and that requires a lot of administrative work. We will be able to use Twitter while the DAO is organized, and use that medium more, thus avoiding the work overload of the CU. ",

The blog is an asset to the DAO in its own right and the DAO should squeeze as much value out of it as possible. Not doing so is giving back all the advantage and momentum built up by the Maker Foundation. If the DAO wants to get that value it will find and fund someone to operate it. The real question is \u201cby what means\u201d     CodeKnight:  We should start by just finding someone interested in spending a few hours a week writing up posts. Then if it gains traction, we can scale up and invest into it. The initial attempt should not require budget adjustments or new CUs.   I advise against this approach. Hiring a lone uncommitted contributor is a recipe for disaster. Who manages them? Who quality checks them? What\u2019s their level of commitment? What posts are they writing? What\u2019s their plan for content? etc. Even hiring a contributor for a few hours of writing a week is not enough, there\u2019s a lot more that goes into it. In my view, this would require a full-time hire at a minimum because of the level of execution the DAO should expect \u2013 The foundation had two people running the blog as their FULL-TIME JOBS(Granted they also triaged media inquiries and contributed to PR strategy) with several other people contributing in a limited capacity. The blog is not an \u201cif it gains traction\u201d kind of thing. It has a large existing readership that\u2019s waiting to be rekindled. There is 0 doubt in my mind that this investment would have a high impact and lots of traction. However, the problem is the setup and additional expense. I reiterate my view; The blog is a key piece of our external communications toolkit. A marketing team will be sorely needed as our protocol comes out with more and more products. I think this needs to be handled with a professional PR/Marketing approach. ",
