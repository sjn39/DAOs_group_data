This money mostly are using as a reward to contract owners, but for simple contracts like registries the fee size could be illogically big as a reward for zero activity from the contract owners. It\u2019s especially relevant when we talk about socially meaningful contracts. And it seems fair enough to transfer this fee into a block reward. Seems like it requires a new opcode for this.   I feel like I saw this idea before, but I couldn\u2019t find the EIP for it. If it\u2019s so provide a link please.  ",
