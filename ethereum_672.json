It has many aspects: brand, coin, community, etc. Vitalik has proposed \"experimental shards\" in Cancun - it would be great.  2) Any core project should have own investable coin, which should reward on adoption in mainnet.  7:18 PM - 28 Jan 2019     2               twitter.com          Dmitry Palchun (Ethernian)     @lrettig ... It took time for me to find an answer for your question, but it amazingly Governance or Leadership did not become part of the solution.  I'm surprised myself.

                    "content": "1. Detailed explanations: Experimental Shards   Ethereum creates much a lot of innovations in research. Nevertheless we have difficulties in adoption: very few of improvements get implemented and the process is very slow. More centralized competitors improve their products faster.   It is a real problem, because there is only two promises can win on the market: \u201cthe most stable\u201d or \u201cthe fastest innovation\u201d. Everything in between, that does not held promise \u201cimmutable like bitcoin\u201d and is not \u201cthe fastest innovator\u201d will fail. Ethereum has promised to be innovative, thats why it MUST be the fastest innovator among of his kind to survive.   Usually people suggest to introduce Ethereum-wide (semi-centralized?) governance in the hope to make decision making faster. The downside will be the greatly decreased inclusivity and the lowed decisions quality because centralized actor get biased much easier. Lack of inclusivity and biased centralized governance will force innovators to split off from Ethereum and continue as separate projects. Ethereum will speed up first but then break apart.   I think, the lack of governance is not the reason why we can not make decisions fast enough. The problem is: decisions to be made are too complex for big amount of decision makers. Someone can make one complex decision, many people can agree on simple decision, but making complex decision by many parties will fail.   Our EIP process now: all CoreDevs must agree on EIP implementation in CoreDev calls. Looks like usual EIP decision is not simple enough and there are too many decision makers. Solution: Let\u2019s allow EIP implementation by few ethereum clients first and let others to join the implementation later. Few clients (or even only one) will agree on EIP faster. If the EIP gets implemented by some clients, it will be easier to adopt it for others.   Implementation idea was proposed by @vbuterin  in Cancun: shards with different state of \u201cmaturity\u201d. An \u201cexperimental\u201d shard may implement \u201cnew experimental features\u201d supported by only one or few ethereum clients. If it works well, other implementations will follow and the EIP gets \u201cmatured\u201d.   The idea of \u201cexperimental shards\u201d or \u201cexperimental sidechains\u201d raises a new interesting question: what is ethereum? What sidechain or shard is still ethereum what is a new separate project? Is it an ETH coin? is it technology? Is it consensus mechanism? Which invariants are ethereum-wide? Is Tendermint or Quorum an ethereum \u201csidechain\u201d? Anyway the more ethereum is able to \u201cunite\u201d different sub-networks, the more strong it will be. It will be great if anyone could start his own \u201cethereum clone\u201d and still stay in ethereum network whatever it will be.   2. Detailed explanations: Core Projects funding: EF vs Community.   Inclusiveness boosts competition of implementations and ideas. Nevertheless some Core Projects were preselected \u201cin advance\u201d in early ages and promoted as part of Ethereum regardless if they will succeed or not. Swarm and Whisper are good examples.   The \u201cearly pre-selection\u201d of the project creates risks:  it creates incentives to prefer EF as an employer over project\u2019s future users. lower incentives for project to deliver, more incentives to become endless story. project can\u2019t be replaced or abandoned easily because it will mean \u201cEthereum failure\u201d. potential competitors are get \u201cofficially pre-excluded\u201d from Ethereum Core Tect because of \u201cofficially pre-selected\u201d one. Think about IPFS, PSS, Filecoin as competitors of Swarm and Whisper.    Al in all: We should check whether any \u201cearly pre-selected\u201d Core projects are retarding the Ethereum project in general. This \u201cpre-selection\u201d of particular projects may had valid reasons three years ago, but now we should re-think their special status. It doesn\u2019t means we (or EF) should stop them or cut off grants, but it means their competitors should become the same chance to become part of Ethereum Core.   How some projects became \u201cpre-selected\u201d by EF? I think they were not. It is just a public perception of the long-term mutual commitment of the EF to fund the project and of the project team to work on it. \u201cFunded by EF\u201d is a strong endorsement, which becomes \u201cpre-selection\u201d over the years with all negative consequences mentioned above.   What can we do? I would prefer to see Core Projects funded by community in some kind of honest ICO or may be by special purpose Prediction Market. It will create enough pressure on projects to perform and it will create incentives to shareholder to review critically what the projects are doing. ICO craze has shown how strong public funding can be. But we have unsolved challenge there:   Challenge: It is officially discouraged for Core and Infrastructure Ethereum projects to create own utility coin if it is possible to operate with ETH. If there is no utility coin, what is the investment vehicle and where are rewards for successful investors are coming from?   Solution idea: if some meaningful Core project gets merged into ethereum main, it will raise ethereum evaluation. This is where investor rewards may come from. The exact mechanism need to be developed yet.   If we succeed to create a mechanism for market evaluation of ethereum core projects, we will speed up ethereum, IMHO.   ",

                    "content": "Thanks for bringing this up. This (the pace of change and innovation) is one of the very most important topics in Ethereum right now. I love the idea of \u201cheterogeneous shards\u201d and I\u2019ve been advocating for this since I first heard about sharding. I remain strongly in favor of this, but agree that it raises some very interesting questions. Here are a few, off the top of my head:  Is any of this possible with Eth1 or must we wait until Eth2? An idea I\u2019ve been toying around with, which is obviously not fully formed, is, can we somehow spin up more \u201cEtherea\u201d i.e. chains with some value today for experimentation? The xDai chain is a great example of this. They could be sidechains, Plasma chains, \u201chard spoon\u201d chains, new chains (e.g.a \u201cLitethereum\u201d chain with a clean ledger, which pushes the envelope on experimentation and research, a bit like a Litecoin to Ethereum\u2019s Bitcoin), or Polkadot parachains. What is the minimum degree of consensus needed to achieve this or similar experimentation? Does it require a hard fork? How much can be done without a hard fork? Setting up a bridge a la xDai, for instance, does not require a fork. Most importantly, seconding the question you asked, it begs the question, \u201cWhat is Ethereum?\u201d The canonical \u201cEth2\u201d roadmap as it stands is for \u201cmany homogenous shards.\u201d How much can be changed without breaking protocol-level homogeneity? The shards will, for instance, potentially have differing fee markets. Could they have different governance policies? Different EIPs as you suggest? It sounds more and more like Polkadot, with a set of heterogeneous \u201cshard\u201d chains.  ",

The challenge here is the economy and business incentives. There is a reason for developers of some particular client to implement EIPs unilaterally: they get paid by their customers running private chains based on their client. It is a B2B business. But what is the reason for two different clients to implement some EIP and run a private chain together? I don\u2019t see any. If the customer does not demand two different clients to support some EIP in his private chain (and I think no one customer will do it), then nobody will push developers of other clients to implement this EIP. Because nobody will give up his own USP (unique selling preposition) and share his customers. It means private \u201cexperimental\u201d side chains creates no incentives to be adopted by many clients, even one by one. Public chain is another business: For an ethereum client it is a public show case for its reliability. This public show case needs millions of users in billions of wealth stored in it, in order to create a strong evidence of reliability. Even if it technically possible, a public \u201cexperimental\u201d shard or side chains need strong incentives for client developers to step in. It means it should be connected enough to the public stable main chain in order to create the same strong evidence of battle-tested reliability as the main chain. In other words, it should be well connected to main ethereum in order to be part of it. This premise defines minimum requirements for the side-chain (or shard). For example:  It should be possible to exchange secure messages between an experimental shard and the stable shard. It should be possible to send and receive ETHs between an experimental shard and the stable shard. \u2026 may be more?  I would ask your technical questions in ethresear.ch. ",

And I\u2019ve become concerned for Ethereum that the Foundation is the primary source of funding, and one that cannot process a grant application in a reasonable, promised amount of time, or make technical decisions in an open process.  But it\u2019s hard to fund work outside of the Foundation, as it\u2019s difficult to make any profit off Layer 1 work.  But it\u2019s also difficult to do sustained R&D while relying on short-term grants, contracts, and personal savings for sustenance.  And it takes sustained R&D to maintain steady innovation. Part of the problem seems to be the intention and belief that everything Ethereum 1.0 is going to be completely replaced \u201cvery soon\u201d.  So why invest resources in the old VM and old PoW chain?  I was telling Casey just a few hours ago that\u2013after 44 years of programming, 37 years in the industry, and 7 years on a world-class VM team\u2013this goes against so much of what I\u2019ve learned about the importance of backwards compatibility, iterative development, integrated R&D, and more that I sometimes want to pull my hair out.  Instead I\u2019m just abrasive on the Gitter channels. So in my opinion Ethereum failing in five years isn\u2019t a thought experiment.  It\u2019s a reality if we don\u2019t prevent it. ",

For now, have added myself as facilitator for EIPs & Standards so we can perhaps push that along a bit. Alexey, who is really leading the charge on state management, won\u2019t be in Paris. Perhaps we should dedicate time for a longer EthRoadmap session again, maybe even within ETHCC? Talking both ETH1x and ETH2 would be useful, in context. Alexey\u2019s state management talks 27 months, which seems like a length of time we should dig into. @lrettig if you\u2019re going to be in Paris, would you volunteer to facilitate another roadmap session, fish bowl style? I\u2019m also turning my attention to when we can next reasonably get everyone together ahead of various Istanbul roadmap deadlines \u2013 mid April. ",

I actually think that having separate organizations in the first place was a mistake, both for the developers and the technology. For the 2.0 developers it seems to have turned into a university as much as a startup.  That may be unfair, tbut delivery has slipped a year or more every year I\u2019ve been here. I do think they have gotten better at R&D, as they work with client teams to keep them up to date, and plan to more realistic schedules. And technologically the beacon chain spec still depends on there being a mainchain. There is no design yet known that does without one, so the mainchain will need to keep running on PoW indefinitely. (Not even some ASIC makers seem to know this.)  And without backwards compatibility it is just another alternative blockchain hanging off of the Ethereum mainchain that happens to have rights to that trademark.  If somebody else provides a scalable EVM-compatible solution on a tighter schedule the trademark might not matter, and that might even be a good thing for the community. ",
