                    "content": "Opening a new market for Dai (and MKR, but this post is to talk about Dai) requires the interest of the project/network/Dapp/etc. -partner- in integrating Dai. This interest comes from the analysis of knowing that integrating Dai will help them attract more users and improve the usability of their product. Once Dai is integrated into the product, it requires a market capable of fulfilling users\u2019 requests. Although Dai liquidity grows in time, there has to be someone deploying the initial capital to get the appropriate traction during the launch. The initial capital could vary depending on the product\u2019s market size and the demand of this new Dai market.  An example: @Growth-Core-Unit  is talking with THORChain, a decentralized liquidity protocol. Currently, USDC and USDT pools are live on THORChain, and if we manage to have a DAI pool, this will enable people to swap native, non-wrapped L1 assets (BTC, LTC, BCH, BNB) for DAI in a permissionless, non-custodial way for the first time (how awesome is that?). To activate the pool, someone has to provide DAI liquidity. This someone will receive the fees generated from trades (The existing stablecoin pools are currently between $6-12MM in depth and have APY >20%), but that someone is also exposed to impermanent loss (this is a DAI:RUNE pool) and the risk associated to the THORChain protocol. This someone could be:  A 3rd party Market Maker  Pros: they take the riks Cons: they take the profit of the pool, and we also have to pay them (nothing is for free)   THORChain, by convincing them to get a DAI loan  We could build a D3M similar solution knowing that:  there is no LP token at the moment. The protocol tracks things internally Assets are Cosmos-based   They could take the loan from Aave  Why do they would do that if we are interested in opening a new market (they already have other stablecoins)     MakerDAO treasury  Pros: it could be created to support other new projects that integrate Dai, and if we do a good risk assessment, it could be profitable Cons: it doesn\u2019t exist  We want to know your opinion about this. Although this matter comes from the specific case of THORChain, we are talking with others about the same, and it would be great to have a solution not just for THORChain but for all other new markets that the multi-chain strategy is about to bring.

Also, we can only do Dai-Rune pool, which opens up to greater risk. Therefore, if the community strongly believes in supporting them, my suggestion is asking Thorchain to allocate Dai themselves. They have a specific budget for such purpose in the first place.  image737\u00d7329 30.1 KB  If the discussion doesn\u2019t work and the Maker community still wants to support them, finding a third party that the Maker community can provide ideally less than 300k Dai might work. The condition can be for example, a loan of one year and Maker community gets what\u2019s left except for yield rewards. So if 300k Dai is divided 50-50 to Rune and Dai and let\u2019s say the price of Rune went up and increased overall, then the Maker community will get back more than 300k Dai, but if the price went down and LP is now only worth 200k Dai, then the community gets back 200k. Rewards are kept by the third party for running it. ",

Good point. But don\u2019t you agree that liquidity + trading volume across the board has diminish? I think one thing I always believed is that in order to benefit, you need to arrive early. As an example if you would have believed in the early days in the Uniswap model of being an LP, you would have been rewarded. I truly believe being early is a good thing. These other layer 1 chains are super early. In fact Maker is super early. And as you know, where there\u2019s risk, there\u2019s possibly a reward. But yes, the risk is that MakerDAO can suffer losses. As they say, risk is real, but fear is a choice. ",

Now, regarding THORChain:  We are discussing the terms with them because we always look for a fair agreement for both parties. THORChain developed a liquidity model with IL protection.  We don\u2019t have to provide the RUNE liquidity part, that\u2019s on them. We have to provide DAI liquidity to the pool. We should move quickly on this one because THORChain\u2019s network is currently capped as the protocol matures. They are listing new pools as the caps rise, so the liquidity we will need to activate the DAI pool will be higher in the next months.  ",
