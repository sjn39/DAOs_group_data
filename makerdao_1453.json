These are currently available on etherscan in one form or another, but it is difficult to find them as they are split across contracts. The following features would be ideal:  A single page where all Maker Protocol System parameters can be displayed. Parameters on the page are categorised by the contract in which they appear. Single sentence explanations of what each parameter means (perhaps using the technical glossary) Brief descriptions of what each contract is for (again perhaps linking or stealing text from the official technical docs.)
