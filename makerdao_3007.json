                    "content": "Introduction B.Protocol is a decentralized backstop protocol. We are live for one month, backstopping around $10m of ETH-A collateral and $3.5m debt. A first successful demonstration was done during the sharp market crash last Thursday. B.Protocol introduces the concept of relying on committed liquidators, who get priority in the liquidation process, in return to their commitment. In ETH-A collateral we are an opt-in system, where users can decide to manage their Vault with us, and give priority to the liquidators. B.Protocol liquidators in return share some of their proceeds with the users who give them the priority. In this write-up we propose to experiment a native integration between B.Protocol and the MakerDAO system, by on-boarding a new collateral type, namely WBTC-B, which will be natively backed by a strong commitment from B.Protocol backstop. EDIT: following @OneBiteLawnOrder question, we want to emphsize that the proposal is for it to be a native collateral in dss (Maker) smart contract, available to all users (e.g., via Oasis and other platforms), and not limited only to B.Protocol front end. A success of such an experiment could benefit Maker to give a better value proposition to the users, namely x10 long position on WBTC, and could pave the way for more collaterals to be backed by B.Protocol with high leverage opportunities. In the next Section we present a proposed set of parameters, then we propose a way to commit on liquidations, and finally we raise topics for further discussion. Collateral parameters  Stability Fee: 4% (like WBTC-A) Liquidation Ratio: 110% (support x10 leverage) Debt Ceiling: 5 million (start with low ceiling in the experimental stage) Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI (*) Minimum Bid Increment: 3% (*) Bid Duration: 6 hours (*) Max Auction Duration: 6 hours (*) Liquidation Penalty: 0-10% (*) Dust: 500 Dai  It is also proposed to use the medianizer price feed directly, instead of the OSM, as otherwise the 10% buffer might not be sufficient until liquidation occurs. (*) The auction parameters are applicable only when one of the backstop members is being liquidated. Committed Backstop design For simplicity we describe a system with a single liquidator. Scaling the system for multiple liquidators, in a permissionless way, will be handled by B.Protocol, and it is not in the scope of this writeup (we presented some ideas on how to achieve fairness here). Initialization: the liquidator opens a Vault with $0.5M WBTC deposit, and 0 debt. We denote this liquidator\u2019s Vault with lv. Liquidator can withdraw collateral or increase his debt, only if his net position (collateral minus debt) is over $0.5M (according to MakerDAO price feed). Liquidation: when calling bite to an unsafe Vault v, then if v==lv, or lv does not have a net position of $0.5M, then v is subject to a standard liquidation process (by the cat or the dog). Otherwise, the entire position of v is forked and added to lv. The user of v is losing all his collateral (which is effectively a maximum of 10% penalty). lv get all the user collateral and all of the user debt. The bite function is callable by anyone. Discussion The expected course of events is that after a liquidation, the liquidator will take action to rebalance his new position, by repaying the new debt. In the long run, if he fails to do it, he risks being liquidated himself. Given each user position is 110% over collateralized, an initial deposit of $X would in ideal situations be sufficient to backstop $10X of debt. Indeed, at a worst case an unsafe Vault has a position of $5.5M of WBTC collateral and $5m of dai debt. This position could be thrown at lv making a safe vault with $6m collateral, and $5m debt\u2026 The proposed mechanism does not give mathematical certainty for the solvency of the system, however, insolvency would result in the liquidator losing his initial $0.5M deposit. Over time the liquidator initial deposit might depreciate in value, and in this case his incentive to retop it is that in the meantime he will not be able to handle new liquidations. This mechanism design give rise to a more committed liquidator, which allows reducing the current WBTC-A 150% collateral ratio (where liquidators are not committed) to 110% collateral ratio in WBTC-B. All the parameters presented here are very preliminary and subject to discussion. The development of bootstrapping of such protocol could be subsidised by B.Protocol, however it is important to generate a long term framework that will allow liquidators to profit. Hence, over time it might be needed to relax the capital requirements, or offer additional incentives to the backstop. Operating within the framework of B.Protocol, who will integrate with additional lending platforms, will give rise to better capital efficiency for the liquidators, which could result in stronger commitment (i.e., capital) from their side. Summary and open questions The proposed collateral would benefit MakerDAO users, as it will allow better leverage (which is currently not available at any existing DeFi platform). It is our belief that this will be obtained without additional risk to the MakerDAO system, and moreover, it will actually increase its stability during sharp market movements. The success of this experiment could lead the way to more higher leveraged assets, which could increase the total dai in circulation, and help prevent future Black Thursday events. This post is a call for discussion on:  what is needed to get the community consent for such a new collateral. missing technical details. E.g., behavior in the event of an emergency shutdown, potential adjustment to the OSM to support tighter collateral levels, changes that might be required when the liquidation 2.0 is live. Starting with a different collateral, e.g., ETH-C, is also something that is up for discussion.  ",

You are correct that technically a $0.5M DAI would give better guarantees, but would require much more changes in the dss (dai smart contract system). While having it in WBTC requires much fewer changes. I guess we can teak it around a bit, such that the $0.5m dai is kept outside the vault, and in the event of a liquidation it is immediately used to repay some of the liquidated vault debt. ",

With 13% penalty, the debt the liquidator will have to pay, will be bigger than the user collateral. Hence, liquidators will not want to on-board the system. Afaik the 13% penalty stem from a concern of an auction griming, or more generally that a keeper will intentionally make his cdp unsafe, hoping to buy his own debt at a lower price. With the proposed system, for a user that is not the backstop, there is no such concern. As for the penalty for the backstop CDP, it can be 13%, but the total collateral will be only 110%, so it is again less meaningful to have it over 10% (at least from what i understand, could be wrong here).

Obviously a fan of allowing users the freedom to decide what is best for them, but leveraged positions are objectively more risky and lead to more liquidations, so IMO it would make sense to ensure B-Protocol can handle a second asset through Maker before opening the door to more risky management parameters.

So 11/15 of the risk is already taken by maker today, and for the 4/15 there is a $0.5M incentive. Of course if bitcoin price goes to 0, then there is nothing we can do to help\u2026 in this case WBTC-A is also screwed (also likely ETH-A and the rest of the non stable). ",

It looks like you\u2019ve assembled quite the team over there at B-Protocol and I imagine I\u2019m not the only member thankful for you bringing your platform and its user base over to Maker. As I mentioned above, my concern would be with adding a new currency for your side to monitor and having that much leverage behind it immediately. The $500K backstop makes a lot of sense for that reason. I\u2019m curious if B-Protocol has any experience with these 10-11X instruments and could provide some data about liquidations to us. We know from experience that \u201cslight\u201d (in terms of greater cryptocurrency volatility) moves have caused pricey liquidations to occur at our end, and you\u2019ve shown how B achieves lower cost liquidations thanks to your system. How can MKR holders know that the same will ring true with these heavily levered contracts? With less time to react to a downswing it would be my fear that a one-two-punch scenario that sees WBTC drop, go flat for a short period of time and drops again the next day could easily eat up the $0.5M backstop. You\u2019ve clearly thought a lot about this offering so I\u2019m wondering if you could walk us through the extra risk management that is needed for these highly levered positions, if there is any.

                    "content": "To answer your question about personal experience, personally I have a lot of experience in on-chain market making, and also some experience in CeFi position management. And the current backstop is market making millions a day, with a typical premium of barely 0.5%. Hence, liquidating with up to 10% premium should be quite doable. Especially if initially we consider a cap of $5M. It should be noted that in CeFI, x101 leverage is offered for BTC/USD, and x10 is quite conservative (true though that DAI is not as liquid as USD, and doing things on-chain introduce additional complications). But what we \u201csell\u201d is not my personal experience, nor the current liquidators (who on-board only if the conditions will be attractive enough). We sell a protocol that incentives liquidators to be committed, and makes it possible for them to focus on the trading aspects, rather than the gas war aspect. We believe that it can give rise to a more robust backstop. A more robust backstop could benefit with Maker in two ways:  Help preventing black-thursday-like events. Allow higher leverage for users.  While (1) is definitely the more important goal, it will be hard to design a gradual process (or a controlled experiment) where we demonstrate our effectiveness in giving value to Maker, as these events happens only once every few years, and a success with a very limited ceiling will not prove much. So we are left with (2). We made a concrete proposal for WBTC with 110% collateral factor just to start a discussion. Let me try to map our interest, and what I think is Maker interest. B.Protocol interest B.Protocol aims to make a framework that incentives committed liquidators. For this purpose what we want is a collateral type that over time will have many users, and a decent liquidation premium. The way to have a collateral with many users is to take an existing popular collateral, and offer better collateral factor, with same stability fees. Technically to compete with WBTC-A\u2019s 150% collateral factor, it will be enough to offer 140% collateral factor. And ETH is also a popular collateral. But that brings me to what i think will bring most value to Maker. Maker (conjectured) interest Maker long term interest is of course the stability of the system, and we do believe that introducing B.Protocol as a liquidation layer could benefit with that. On the more measurable aspect, to justify the integration effort, it would be good to offer something new, which will give additional value to the users (which in turn will help increase the circulation of dai). So it is my understanding that WBTC-B with 140% collateral factor might not be novel enough, and likewise offering ETH-C. But from my side we will be happy to start with such an option, if this is what the community wants. More generally, regarding market crashes, eventually all we \u201csell\u201d is an incentive to do liquidations, not an insurance like nexus mutual. If market drops by 60%, the liquidators will not liquidate, they will prefer to lose their $0.5M collateral, and it will be up to Maker keepers to backstop it. Of course once the ceiling is raised over $5m, it will be possible to introduce additional collateral requirements. But it should be noted that in CeFi, x10 leverage is far from highly leveraged product. ",

Along the lines of what @iammeeoh is saying, I think with adding a new asset under B-Protocol for the Maker side would probably require less leveraged risk to be accepted by the community, though I do not want to speak for all the diverse opinions of MKR holders. I know I would personally be more comfortable seeing this done with ETH, as your system has already proved effective at handling the lower leveraged positions for ETH and in general we at Maker have some of the higher interest rates for borrowing ETH across DeFi. Allowing another product with the ability to leverage more at the same stability fee would be a real incentive for ETH lenders to come back over to Maker. I think a poll is probably in order to gauge support, as I also imagine with minimum tweaks on the WBTC proposal it wouldn\u2019t be hard to get a plurality of support from the forum. If there is disagreement from the community about this I\u2019d love to hear why, as to me it sounds like if we were to dial down the risk just a tad it would be a clear win-win for the partnership.

                    "content": "I was always in favour of implementing liquidation backstop tools. We saw how DeFi Saver saved a bunch of loans on Black Thursday and how important this can be. Of course with Liq 2.0 we should be better protected when it comes to liquidations and some might argue that such tools don\u2019t help Maker on revenue side because penalty fees are not collected. I am more on risk averse side and prefer more safety and hence prefer liquidation backstop versus higher auction efficiency. That is because a lot of assets depend on off-chain liquidity and we would still need to heavily rely on keepers even if Liq 2.0 is perfect and totally automated. Now, regarding this implementation I have few questions and comments. I think 110% LR is a bit too aggressive. Even though medianizer price is used and less volatile WBTC is proposed, 10%+ crashes are not unusual. Such drop happened 4 times this year and drop took much less than an hour. I do think that if we were to do it for any crypto asset, WBTC makes most sense because it is least volatile. And I agree that initially very low DC would need to be set, probably even lower than 5m at the early beginning where some liquidation test runs would be performed. Finally, as much as I understand, this implementation requires some adjustments to current code. Bites would need to be incentivized so you can force liquidator vault to merge position and flipper contract would need to get modified? I guess bite incentivization was anyway something we discussed for Liq 2.0, but for modifying flipper contract, Smart contract team would need to comment on it. And it would be also cool to hear from Oracles if they see any potential problems using medianizer price for WBTC. ",

Any liquidator for them has to post $0.5M in DAI (in the event of a $5M DC) in one of our Vaults. In an event of an under-collateralized vault, the debt and the collateral get transferred to the obligated B.Protocol liquidator. They would be taking care of the liquidations entirely, but I suggested Maker should still get a slight portion of the liquidation fee for providing the customers through our platform. In the event that a dedicated liquidator becomes under-collateralized (from being transferred the remainder of the bad vaults and not being able to unwind the positions) then our regular auction liquidation process would take place, with the full liquidation fee going to Maker. Basically under the current B.Protocol ETH vault they take ALL the fees for liquidations and split them between the dedicated liquidators and their user jar. The reason we would be getting a cut under this new collateral system is because it is the intent that users would be able to sign up for this vault type both through B.Protocol\u2019s site and Oasis. The argument is this is a better form for liquidations, and by participating with them as a backstop we can actually support more leveraged products for users. ",

We are open to such discussions, of course for 300k DAI ceiling the backstop collateral will be much lower than $0.5M. But starting with such low ceiling must come along with a clear roadmap on how to increase it, otherwise non of the liquidators will be willing to make the effort. Also technically 105% ratio might not be very suitable to Maker oracles, who are with 1 hour delay, and being updated only when price changes by 2%. This is why we propose to use the real time price feed instead. But still 5% premium on USD/ETH price, when feed is 2% off, and DAI/USD price could also be few % off might be hard. ",
