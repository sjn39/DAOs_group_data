Voting costs definitely need to come down, especially given the current EVM txfee scenario. I am not sure if subsidizing gas costs is the way to go. Maybe it makes sense to fund research into layer 2 voting technologies, such as zkrollup. ",

All of us \u2018playing\u2019 in the crypto space know perfectly well that it is risky for a large number of reasons (bugs, regulations, flash crashes)\u2026 We MKR holders lost money on that event (because new MKR had to be minted, and MKR price dropped enormously), just as the CDP holders did\u2026 Yesterday (18th Sept) there was some kind of hacking on Metamask related to the UNI release. Do you think Metamask and/or UniSwap will compensate the poor guys who lost their money? The answer is: No. As it should be. ",

The most important thing we can do right now is start bootstrapping the DAO with more domain teams and collateral onboarding.   I honestly don\u2019t know why people don\u2019t understand that companies need cash for operations not to mention to pay people for work. Surplus needs to go into a treasury which would be used for Operational Maker expenses (it  costs ETH to update the contracts folks), onboard Domain teams, sourceCRED, grants, etc. Eventually the Treasury should have various things that hold value even when markets take a dump as this would be where we could look for value instead of minting MKR to raise DAI. Almost every company in the world has cash on hand for operating expenses.   Once we get to some reasonable amount of DAI/treasury funds personally I would just set a rising floor that MKR would be purchased for (bottom bid) rather than selling DAI in a reverse auction for MKR.  Now if we have DAI coming out of our ears in the surplus and know we have banked at least 12-24months of MKR operations fees, EPC/Domain team salaries, legal, advertising, etc.etc. AND MKR price is low sure I\u2019d vote to reverse auction DAI for MKR. There is more to company value than just buying back stock. ",

We need to start having more transparency on the foundation\u2019s expenses before we can see how much income from stability fees should go to paying for growth. I do think some portion of the income should still go to burning MKR as we will have situations where new MKR has to be minted.  If we stop all burns, then MKR supply will grow indefinitely and unpredictably.  This is different than other governance token models that at least have a defined issuance schedule. ",

The fees comes in at a rate which entirely depends on our ability to extract value while maintaining the peg. They might be 0 for periods of time. Even if we have a buffer for expenses, our lack of a planning for a bounded period of time should never be able to shut down operations. So in a scenario where there is no expenses buffer left and revenue is 0, we would have to mint MKR to continue funding operations. This would be possible because MKR price should ~reflect prospects on all future fee revenues. So why not directly do that? Why not continuously print&sell MKR at a rate which covers our expenses, starting with a buffer equal to say 1 year of expected operational costs? (This might sound like it entails a set of detailed decisions out of reach of the way governance works at the moment but I hope that with vote delegation and domain teams we can have the decisionmaking speed&power necessary to do something like that).

Alternatively, one could argue that scaling the Dai supply will provide orders of magnitude better return over the long run than some short-sighted burning in the short-term. In that sense, onboarding more Domain Teams that are paid by the DAO is reasonable as well. ",

Otherwise MKR holders are better of redeeming that cash through buy and burn and making more productive investment elsewhere. This means one first needs to define and estimate what are minimum operating costs and income sources and then proceed from there. ",
