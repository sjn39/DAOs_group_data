We have gone from a DAO only capable of doing 10M in Dai creation to one of over a Billion and are still growing rapidly. The number of Dai is going to continue to grow, however Ethereum 1 and perhaps even still into Ethereum 2, as MakerDao shifts over, is not providing a suitable fee environment for layer 1 lending.  Fees are out of hand at least in the near term when it comes to regular users trying to operate vaults. What do you see as some potential solutions MakerDao can implement in order to keep the MCD system usable by the masses at more affordable fees moving forward through the next 5 years? ",

The upsides are clearly massively reduced fees as well as transaction times. The downside with an idea like this is that it is less secure, may be difficult to safely implement and coordinate, and may not even be workable with the current system (MakerDao may need to shift the entire system on to the layer two and then work backwards to bring the tokens to Ethereum again to make this truly work properly). I am sure there are better ideas out there and all sorts of state channels, plasma solutions, ZK snarks, and better tech that has not crossed my mind.  Or maybe some of you think that the system running on layer 1 is just fine and fees will come down enough to allow for regular usage? I am sure MakerDao is going to go in multiple directions as it always does with regard to improvement.  Some other orgs will step in and facilitate lower fees through use of their product in connection with the MakerDao system.  I am just curios as to what our community thinks is the best path forward in terms of fees at the present time.  I am just reflecting and theory crafting a little in the new year\u2026 Happy New Year Everyone! ",

I think our value is being a DeFi primitive and we need to be on layer 1 for maximum composability. I believe we need to focus on the protocol, not so much the user experience from a fee perspective. I agree that the fees are out of hand and many of the transactions could and should occur on a Layer 2 but I think innovation in this sphere can be brought about by 3rd party projects that integrate with the Maker protocol. I envision a future where almost no individual takes out a loan directly from Maker because the Layer 1 fees are prohibitively expensive. I picture multiple Layer 2 projects that provide affordable UIs for users. These projects would use Maker on the back end and batch all their users transactions in order to minimize layer 1 fees. ",

                    "content": "I think that ETH Layer 1 is dead for all use cases except hodling and occasional high-value trading (and, of course, L1-L2-L1 transfers). BTC was in the similar situation a few years ago and they \u201csolved\u201d the problem by creating BCH+lightning and getting rid of all unnecessary use cases like payments, privacy, programmability\u2026 They managed to lower the average fee from $50 to $5 but that fee will start rising again in this bull market. The $5 BTC fee usually equals $50-$100 ETH DeFi fee. ETH cannot get rid of anything since it\u2019s not perceived as a store of value. It is also not realistic to expect much more bandwith in layer 1 because it must stay decentralized to fight the regulations in the short term. The obvious solution is to follow the Uniswap/Loopring/Compound/USDC\u2026 steps and build on L2. Sure, it would be nice to provide only low level functionality on L1 and let others build L2 integrations but I guess that also requires DAI redesign without the benefit of L2 income which could be significant. I think DAI is facing a slow death (replaced with another decentralized stablecoin) if it does not operate on L2. I know it\u2019s a huge job to do it requiring starting from scratch and $millions in funding but someone must do it. EDIT: Average tx fee on 1/3/2021: 392 gwei ",

                    "content": "I think we should pilot some experiments here at MakerDAO. As discussed in:     Transparency - MakerDAO Validator of xDai Blockchain Governance       Quick infos about xDAI: The xDai blockchain, which I am experimenting a bit with recently, is basically like Ethereum but with:   PoS (Proof of Stake) instead of PoW xDAI instead of ETH as native gas-currency.  More informations here: https://www.xdaichain.com/  Currently, the Validators (the actors participating in the Proof of Stake) are the 12 entities listed here: https://validators.poa.network/poa-dapps-validators  Fact: MakerDAO is a Validator.  I have some questions:  Question 1) \u2026      people are generally in favour of creating a \u201cxDAI Domain Team\u201d or, more generally, a \u201cL2 Domain Team\u201d. Speaking about xDAI, it is 100% compatible with Ethereum and so it should be possible to run MakerDAO code on it easily. My idea: Furthermore, to reduce risks, since MakerDAO runs a xDAI-Validator, we could require, at the level of the smartcontract code, that MakerDAO\u2019s transactions need to be \u2018mined\u2019 (i.e., validated/built/created) by the MakerDAO validator. This way we would basically run a L2 version of MakerDAO where we (i.e., MakerDAO\u2019s validator) create the relevant blocks. Seems a pretty interesting direction to me. ",
