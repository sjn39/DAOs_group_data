We say we\u2019re not interested in stateless miners, but if there are no full nodes, how can we mine? Do we foresee the possibility of stateless clients on their own mining blocks?  How do we change the roadmap? What is the process to change/add to it? It seems like there is a low hanging fruit to develop stateless contracts vs. a full stateless ethereum network. Is there an interest in doing that?  How many full nodes do we need to keep having to have a healthy stateless client network? How do you see the initial sync being faster? Can we add a new JSON RPC API that requests the witness for a given block? Could you do a full sync with witnesses faster than you can do it today?  What do you mean about bad witnesses? Could we enable predictable state access / access control lists on Eth1? When do you expect the current effort to go in production? Would that be pre-\u201dEth1 coupled to Eth2\u201d Based on the current roadmap, how are contract developers affected? How does the change from a hexary to binary trie affect witness generation? What research needs to be done to motivate increasing gas costs ASAP?  If stateless clients come out, does that mean the overheads for syncing the current 9-10M blocks would still apply?  If you split the gas costs for witnesses and opcodes, could we see lower gas costs for state reads and writes? What are the top 3 questions to answer to solve stateless clients? Our average block is ~24kb and if we want to have 1MB blocks, how do we get there? Should we double every month until we get there?  When talking about the size of witnesses, would it be good to be more granular about what the various parts of it, to handle the various parts differently.? Comment: Not sure it\u2019s wise to add a new experimental crypto to L1. Need an extra amount of effort and evidence for the proposer of this system. How do we know this is effective? What if there are things we didn\u2019t foresee and this lowers the TPS? Are you soliciting reviews from the community?  Where can people go to participate? If there are developers that want to tackle converting the binary tree to a hexary one, what should they do?  ",
