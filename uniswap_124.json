A UNI <> ICHI partnership was discussed on the June 2nd and June 30th Uniswap community calls. Based on the positive feedback from those community calls and feedback from multiple community members, we created $oneUNI. This is the sixth stable asset launched with ICHI\u2019s V2 contracts with prior launches supported by 1inch, Filecoin, Wing, and more. We hope to now kick off the community discussion on use and support of oneUNI with this temperature check. I\u2019d like to thank all of those who provided feedback in this process. Why? $515M $USDC and $181M $USDT are locked within Uniswap V3. $UNI is sold to mint $USDC and $USDT. The value locked is governed for the benefit of Centre and Tether. $UNI is purchased to mint $oneUNI. The value locked is governed by $oneUNI holders for the benefit of the Uniswap community. What? $oneUNI was created on 08/23/2021 with the ICHI Factory, audited by Quantstamp and Solidified. It will become a new base asset on Uniswap. You can deposit $oneUNI to earn $ICHI rewards. ICHI has three upcoming use cases for $oneUNI:  Stable Arbitrage: 20% of each oneToken\u2019s collateral is deposited to Uniswap V3 to provide $USDC-$oneToken liquidity. The USDC side of the pools will be converted to $oneUNI. ICHI Vaults: ICHI is in the audit process for novel Uniswap V3 liquidity mining vaults. $oneUNI will be a base asset for these vaults. ICHI Rebalancer: ICHI oneTokens must establish Member Token-USDC range orders on Uniswap V3 to rebalance their treasuries. $oneUNI will become a new base asset for these range orders.  $oneUNI can be recommended to $UNI grant recipients who need USD exposure. For example, grants could be paid in $oneUNI, enabling grant recipients like the DeFi Alliance to pay for necessary operational expenses. Napkin Math $oneUNI is currently minted with 98% $USDC and 2% $UNI. The goal of this proposal is to loan $UNI to the $oneUNI contract so that the minting ratio may be lowered from 98% to 80%.

(See Figure 1)  A small drop in UNI price can convert this to almost all $UNI.  However, it takes a large increase in UNI price to make it 50-50 UNI-USDC.  ICHI vaults will fix this by incentivizing buy-side liquidity. Solution: ICHI Vaults (ICHI Use Case #2 in proposal) can incentivize the addition of Stable UNI ($oneUNI) to a $oneUNI-$UNI pool.  This liquidity range could be from -50% to -0.35%.  This \u2018Liquidity Put\u2019 helps prevent a drop in UNI price.  It will work for all other crypto projects as well!
