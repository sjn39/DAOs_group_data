                    "content": "Who is the interested party for this collateral application? Porter Finance, a bond issuance platform for DAOs. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Porter Finance allows DAOs to issue and sell zero-coupon bonds to raise capital. DAOs over-collateralize bonds with assets from their treasuries and provide an on-chain promise to repay. Porter Finance underwrites bond issuances by thoroughly reviewing the issuing DAO\u2019s financials and analyzing the risk of the collateral provided. Porter addresses a gap in on-chain capital markets. Up until this point, DAOs in need of capital, even those that generate significant revenue, have had no option but to sell tokens either in private or public markets. This can mis-align incentives and be dilutive to token holders. Porter recognizes that the DAO landscape is far too diverse to be adequately serviced by a single capital markets strategy (token sales). Just like companies, DAOs have working capital needs: marketing, research & development, paying and acquiring contributors, and payment of service providers, among other things. Companies that generate revenue have the luxury of accessing a diverse array of financing: revenue backed finance, factoring, supply chain finance, lines of credit, venture debt, bonds, debentures etc. Porter seeks to open the aperture of on-chain capital markets by offering revenue-producing DAOs the opportunity to access what are, effectively, corporate bond markets, and to maintain protocol-owned liquidity. Unlike corporate bonds, however, the terms (security interest, convertibility, covenants etc.) embedded in DAO bonds are mediated by smart contracts rather than legal ones. An extension of this fact is the replacement of legal risk with smart contract risk. This adds a new layer of determinism and composability to debt capital markets. We\u2019ve undergone a Zellic audit and are currently undergoing another through Spearbit which will be completed before the late May launch. The DAO bonds themselves, as well as the issuing DAO\u2019s treasury assets, implement the ERC-20 standard. So far, and for the purposes of this application, Porter has implemented two zero-coupon bond structures: a simple and a convert. Simple refers to a bond, secured by assets, that is either refinanced or paid down at maturity. Convert refers to convertibility, or the option retained by the bond buyer to exercise a conversion of the bond ERC-20 to the issuer\u2019s native tokens. Provide a brief history of the project. Porter Finance is planning on launching in late May. The protocol has been under development since January 1st, 2022. It has raised funding from respected funds such as Dragonfly Capital, ParaFi Capital, and Nascent Ventures as well as notable DeFi veterans such as Robert Leshner and Kain Warwick. Porter Finance is advised by Sidney Powell, the CEO and co-founder of Maple Finance. Sidney has over half a decade of experience in corporate finance and credit risk. In Q1 2022, Maple surpassed $1BN in loans originated with no defaults. It is the most successful DeFi protocol that underwrites credit risk. ShapeShift is an official launch partner of Porter Finance. They will be issuing debt through our platform to refinance an existing debt position that is being used to pay their contributors. ShapeShift is profitable and has generated over $14M of revenue in 2022 alone. Their monthly revenues have consistently increased since inception in October 2021. We look forward to helping grow their thriving business by capitalizing them with DAI. Ribbon is another launch partner we are working with. They will be raising a few million dollars via our platform for a few potential uses: scaling the team, protocol owned liquidity, bootstrapping fuse pool liquidity, and relending unused capital. Implementation In the proposed implementation, MakerDAO may deploy the D3M to finance DAO bonds through Porter Finance at a fixed cost of capital. MakerDAO would selectively fund specific DAO bond issuances on the Porter platform. Currently, bonds are sold via an auction where market participants make bid orders with a volume and price. If the order is competitive, the order gets filled at auction clearance.  Slide 16_9 - 31148\u00d7682 32 KB  There can only be one currency used for the bond issuance and auction. MakerDAO can use this to their advantage by guaranteeing the issuing DAO a bid with a competitive price and volume in exchange for them issuing their bond in DAI. This will create organic demand equivalent to the whole issuance size, while MakerDAO only has to commit the amount of DAI in their bid. In addition to the interest generated by the DAO bonds, MakerDAO would also benefit from 5% emissions of Porter\u2019s native token. The collateral against which DAI is minted will be the ERC20 token that represents the bond issued.

The Porter community is building a decentralized credit market so that DAOs can grow and thrive. | 2,222 members      How is the applying collateral type currently used? Bonds are sold to fixed income investors looking to generate yield by lending to creditworthy DAOs. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Porter Finance is incorporated in the US and claims no legal responsibility for the bonds issued through its smart contracts. DAOs issuing bonds are typically unincorporated and thus do not reside in any jurisdiction. Where does exchange for the asset occur? The asset exchange occurs via a Gnosis Auction. Issuing DAOs mint bonds via Porter Finance smart contracts and sell them via Gnosis Auction smart contracts. ",

The potential for liquidity and composability of this debt primitive is significant.

One can already envision this as the kernel for securitization markets to sprout\u2026Maker ingests a diversity of DAO bonds, pools them, and sells off exposures to other credit investors as per their appetites.

Is this in fact the case?  Exactly! Borrowing DAOs lock tokenized collateral in their bond contracts as a prerequisite to issuing bonds. This removes the need for a third party to escrow the collateral by creating a programmatically guaranteed security interest.  How does Porter underwrite the issuing DAOs creditworthiness and the defensibility of the collateral pledged? Does it use historical revenues/profits and back into a debt service coverage ratio?  Porter underwrites bond issuances through the performance of a credit analysis. We review six key factors to predict the probability of a DAO defaulting on debt: character, capital, capacity, conditions, collateral, and contracts. Historical revenues/profits are covered in the \u201ccapacity\u201d portion of the analysis. We have an overview of our underwriting process laid out here in our documentation.  In your experience, do DAOs who might borrow via DAI bonds want to pay operating expenses in DAI? Is there an argument to be made that this sort of lending would support to a stickier form of DAI?  Yes, this is what gets me so excited about this partnership! From our conversations with DAOs, we\u2019ve learned that DAI is sometimes preferred over more centralized stable coins such as USDC. Some DAOs are concerned about the non-zero risk of Circle banning them from using USDC and therefore are more comfortable using DAI. Therefore, DAI borrowed by these DAOs would be much stickier as it is much  more likely to be held in the treasury and used to pay contributors. ",

                    "content": " With that in mind, is this MIP6 requesting a D3M implementation for both the Simple & Convert Bonds?  Yes, we are requesting both simple and convertible bonds to be used. They both share a similar low-risk profile due to DAOs going through verification, underwriting, heavily over-collateralizing issuances, and signing an on-chain promise of repayment.  And is it reasonable to think of a Simple Bond as a Junior Tranche?  Both convertible and simple bonds do not support tranching in their current form, however this is something we will be implementing in future products. Although, due to their composability coming from the implementation of the ERC-20 interface, bonds can be pooled and tranched in aggregate by anyone ingesting them. As @teej mentioned in his response, MakerDAO could ingest multiple bonds, pool them, and sell off a junior tranche to mitigate its risk.  Also, can you please provide more color on liquidation risk, such as incurring bad debt, or unbacked debt, during the liquidation process\u2013like if Bonds cannot be sold at a sufficiently large average price in order for Porter to recover the debt outstanding.  As a platform, we are heavily incentivized to mitigate the risk our lenders are taking. DAOs heavily over-collateralize their issuances, go through verification and underwriting, and sign on-chain promises of repayment to mitigate the risk a lender takes. However, if a default does occur, MakerDAO, as a bondholder, would be able to exchange their bonds for the collateral provided. Due to the heavy over-collateralization required, it is likely that this collateral would be more than enough to cover the principal plus interest owed. In the unlikely event where this is not the case, MakerDAO would incur bad debt and take a loss on this loan. Diversification through allocation to multiple bonds is something MakerDAO can do to mitigate this risk. ",

BUT quite differently, Maker would take exposure, albeit at low leverage (maybe 20-40% LTV), to long-tail assets (DAO tokens) it would otherwise (probably) not permit as eligible collateral at home. These DAO assets presumably wouldn\u2019t be eligible collateral for native Maker vaults because the cost-benefit analysis falls short. i.e. the ((Annual Borrow Volume)*(Interest Rate)) doesn\u2019t offset the (vault implementation cost amortized + annual oracle costs).

It is designed to bring predictability to borrowers on platforms that MakerDAO is confident can execute well.

Because bond terms are bespoke to each issuing DAO, it may make sense to take a more flexible approach. Porter is currently underwriting issuances with the intent of accurately pricing risk. I believe it would be most efficient and practical for MakerDAO to commit to offering liquidity to DAOs who meet certain credit requirements.

What\u2019s the TAM for this market in your view and could you talk a bit about Porter\u2019s strategy to scale and what level of exposure Porter plans to take on in the short and medium term? DAO financing seems like a natural fit for Maker to get in on the ground floor of and support, especially to the extent that incentives are aligned and the DAO decides to help bootstrap Porter. As you pointed out, DAI in DAO treasuries is much stickier than DAI used in DeFi. Could you please also share some information about the liquidation process should the collateralization ratio fall below the specified level? ",

It\u2019s tough to get exact numbers on this, but we estimate there are around $5B of assets in DAO treasuries. Because we expect issuances to have LTV\u2019s around 20%, we can assume the TAM to be $1B at the current market size. We plan to grow alongside the DAOs we are directing capital towards. As they invest in their businesses, they will grow, allowing us to scale up their credit facilities.  What level of exposure Porter plans to take on in the short and medium term?  Can you expand on this?  Could you please also share some information about the liquidation process should the collateralization ratio fall below the specified level?  We do not liquidate DAOs. Instead, we establish creditworthiness through a credit analysis and rate the issuance. As proposed above, it may make sense for MakerDAO to only offer liquidity to DAOs achieving certain ratings. We also require issuances to be heavily overcollateralized and the issuing DAOs must sign an on-chain promise to repay. ",

What is the performance record (in terms of losses) over the lifetime this has operated?  We have not launched yet. We are planning on launching later this month.  How does Porter Make money?  Porter makes money through issuance fees. We take a percentage of capital raised.  What sort of Stability Fee are you envisioning for this facility, and initial debt ceiling?  The stability fee would be whatever interest rate the bond is paying. We anticipate Maker will make 10-20% returns. We feel a 5-10M initial debt ceiling is a good size to start.  How is this \u2018oracleless\u2019?  Without liquidations, the protocol doesn\u2019t need to know the price of the collateral assets.  Where does the underlying trade, and more importantly who can trade it?  The bonds will not have liquid markets at launch. We plan on adding this as a feature later this year. All trades will need to be performed OTC. ",

Since your application is listed as a MIP6, these applications follow the Collateral Application and template. In addition, you might want to look at MIP67: Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions which may apply. Since you are the expert with your collateral, the application is designed to help Maker understand what you are proposing and the market opportunity. Otherwise, the community will spend a lot of time (or not) trying to determine if this is something that makes sense to move forward. I realize the MIP process can be complicated. Part of the service my team provides is to provide consultation on the process. If you have any questions on the process, please let me know. We can also schedule a call if that works better. Thanks!
