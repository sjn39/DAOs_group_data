Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  Online PDF Version    Current Events  MakerDAO Votes to Disable Aave DAI Supply, Reducing Celsius Exposure MakerDAO Votes to Disable Aave DAI Supply, Reducing Celsius Exposure [Signal Request] Set the AAVE D3M DC to 0 (Zero) URGENT: Signal Request Set Aave D3M bar to 0% On June 14, GovAlpha submitted an urgent Signal Request in accordance with the MIP24c4 Urgent Response Procedure to disable the Aave DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M), limiting Maker\u2019s exposure to the precariously positioned Celsius exchange (check out last week\u2019s Weekly Relay for an overview of the Celsius/stETH situation). The MakerDAO community passed the proposal on June 15, and it was executed on June 17.   twitter.com    Maker @MakerDAO  The Maker Governance has voted to temporarily disable the @AaveAave DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M).  This change is available for execution on June 17 2022 21:03 UTC.  \ud83d\uddf3 vote.makerdao.com/executive/temp\u2026   11:34 PM - 15 Jun 2022           35                15            The proposal sets the Target Borrow Rate, or \u201cbar,\u201d to 0, preventing Celsius from taking out further loans. Celsius had borrowed 100M DAI using the de-pegged stETH token as collateral, while Maker only stood to take in 1.4% APY in revenue from this position. @Primoz and many other community members argued persuasively that this low revenue level does not offset the risks. The Risk Core Unit will reassess the situation and present their opinions\u2014possibly including a recommendation to re-enable the Aave D3M\u2014at the following MakerDAO Open Market Committee (MOMC) meeting in about one week.  The Endgame Party Delegate Signup The Endgame Party delegate signup The business-oriented scientific governance delegate signup As Rune continues to host the Open Decentralized Voter Committee calls, he recently introduced the Endgame Plan itself will have multiple stages of voting, including a preliminary Signal Request and the Endgame Plan Launch MIP. Additionally, Rune states that it will be beneficial and stabilizing to get a general understanding of the level of support for the Endgame Plan. As a result, Rune posted a thread where delegates can sign up to help run the Endgame Party. However, committed delegates are expected to attend as many Endgame Party Decentralized Voter Committees as possible, vote in general accordance with its direction, and contribute with information, ideas and proposals. Currently, the following recognized delegates have signed up and committed to the Endgame Plan:     Recognized Delegate Platform Signup Post     Doo Nam Platform Signup   JustinCase Platform Signup   3F Delegate LLC Platform Signup   Flipside Crypto Platform Signup   Penn Blockchain Platform Signup   Feedblack Loops LLC Platform Signup    Other recognized delegates, such as ChrisBlec, Mhonkasalo & teemulau, and MakerMan, have decided to support the Endgame vision while remaining independent to maintain their platform values and promote decentralized delegation. Furthermore, SebVentures has posted his own Delegate signup platform for a plan that is more business-oriented. His vision is simple: improving balance sheet allocation by investing in liquid tokens, lending against them, and promoting market making.  This Week in Governance Weekly MIPs Update #92  Executive Vote(s) Temporarily Disable the Aave DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) - June 15, 2022 This was an out-of-schedule executive proposal. It has been deployed and added to the voting portal in response to an urgent signal request that was posted on the recommendation of the Risk Core Unit (RISK-001) facilitator. This executive proposal passed and, as per this urgent signal request, the following changes occurred within the Maker Protocol:  The Aave DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) Target Borrow Rate (bar) was set to 0.  This change was proposed to disable the Aave D3M temporarily. Note that while setting the bar to 0 might intuitively suggest that the Aave D3M will utilize its entire debt ceiling, it is a pre-programmed state in the D3M code that will set the vault to unwind only.

                    "content": " Weekly Relay | June 7th - 13th, 2022 Hi everyone, thanks for checking out the Weekly Relay! Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  Online PDF Version    Current Events $stETH/ $ETH Peg in \u201cRough Shape\u201d Celsius & MakerDAO The stETH token, issued to Lido Finance users to secure ETH after the merge, suffers from severe liquidity problems. At the time of this writing, Curve\u2019s ETH/stETH pool is composed of nearly 80% stETH, and stETH is trading at a 5% discount against ETH. In short, the peg has broken. The Celsius Network, which as of June 10 held nearly 450k $stETH worth $1.5 billion, is facing a liquidity crisis due to the depeg and has frozen all withdrawals, swaps, and transfers. In addition to holding significant positions across major DeFi protocols, Celsius\u2019 liquidity crisis directly contributes to today\u2019s market crash. MakerDAO\u2019s biggest debt holder, Celsius, has been consistently adding WBTC as collateral, which may compound the exchange\u2019s problems if the market continues to decline.  The Endgame Plan part 3: The Endgame Decentralized Workforce @rune has published Part 3 of his Endgame Plan for revamping Maker governance.  Some of the goals outlined and the methods for achieving them include:  Making it easy for MKR holders to participate in decisions Focusing on dealing with the budget challenge Securing separation of powers via MetaDAOs Ensuring transparency and inclusion in all public interactions Open-sourcing frameworks are used to guide decisions and measure the results  The extensive post also discusses a new Budget Allocator role, the DAO2DAO paradigm, and several new types of Core Units, such as Supporting Core Units (SCUs), Administrative Core Units (ACUs), and Contributing Core Units (CCUs).). This post also briefly recaps the role of Decentralized Voter Committees in this proposed new governance system. All MKR holders can join Decentralized Voter Committees that promote impactful participation in governance on high-level topics and provide feedback to Delegates about MKR holders\u2019 opinions. Keep an eye on the forums for announcements regarding the next Decentralized Voter Committee session.  Specialization Unlocks Complexity  \u2026the complexity of Maker\u2019s product has outgrown its brain.  Teej posted an alternative solution to Rune\u2019s Endgame Plan\u2019s Maker governance problems. Specifically, @teej is worried about:  Maker\u2019s unmanageable complexity makes it nearly impossible for delegates to make informed decisions on every new proposal in Maker; and This complexity makes voter turnout low (about 9%).  As a solution, the post recommends that Maker governance be split into two primary groups: Governors and Clusters. Governors will focus on high-level strategic decisions around Maker\u2019s goals and long-term vision, e.g.:  Should 20% of costs be cut in a bear market? Should a Core Unit\u2019s budget be approved? Could MakerDAO onboard \u201cunsecured\u201d debt if it enhances DAI network effects while sacrificing \u201chardness\u201d?   The Governors would be freed from operational issues related to hiring, firing, budgeting, etc., allowing them to focus on their core duties and keep up with DAO activities. To implement the high-level strategies outlined by the Governors, the Clusters will focus on executing the day-to-day tasks. A Cluster may consist of multiple Core Units. For example, RWA Clusters could include LTS, RWF, and CES. The Core Units should be given higher levels of autonomy to solidify the separation between high-level strategic decision-making and daily execution and take advantage of specialization\u2019s known benefits. @teej believes this solution addresses many of the same issues as the Endgame Plan but in a less disruptive way.  This Week in Governance  Weekly MIPs Update  Ratification polls, proposals, and pre-MIP discussions.  Executive Vote(s) Parameter Changes, Starknet Bridge Limit and Authority Changes, Recognized Delegate Compensation, SH-001 Budget Distribution - June 08, 2022 This colossal executive proposal passed, and the following changes occurred within the Maker Protocol:  MOMC Parameter Changes     Parameter Vault Type Decreased / Increased Amount From \u2192 To     Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) WSTETH-A - 100 million DAI 300 million DAI \u2192 200 million DAI   Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI - 200 million DAI 300 million DAI \u2192 100 million DAI   Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) LINK-A - 50 million DAI 100 million DAI \u2192 50 million DAI   Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) MANA-A + 5 million DAI 10 million DAI \u2192 15 million DAI   D3M Target Borrow Rate (bar)  DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI - 0.75% 3.5% \u2192 2.75%   Target Available Debt (gap) WSTETH-B + 15 million DAI 15 million DAI \u2192 30 million DAI      Maximum Debt Ceiling Reductions As per these governance polls (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the following vault types had their Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) set to 0 DAI as the first-step of the collateral off-boarding process defined in MIP62:  UNI-A UNIV2DAIETH-A UNIV2WBTCETH-A UNIV2UNIETH-A UNIV2WBTCDAI-A   For more information, please see the original Signal Request on the forum here.   Starknet DAI Bridge Technical Changes As a result of this post from the StarkNet Engineering Core Unit (SNE-001), the following changes were made:  100,000 DAI increased the DAI Bridge Limit from 100,000 DAI to 200,000 DAI. Please note Maker Governance has already approved a DAI Bridge Limit of up to 5 million DAI in this governance poll.  DSChief was given control over L1EscrowMom. This change allows Maker Governance to shut down the Starknet Bridge via an Executive Vote without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay for the shutdown to take effect.  This was achieved by calling setAuthority(0x0a3f6849f78076aefaDf113F5BED87720274dDC0) on the L1EscrowMom contract.      Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Budget Distribution As per their successful budget proposal, the following budget distributions took place for the Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001):   230,000 DAI were transferred to the Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) at 0xc657aC882Fb2D6CcF521801da39e910F8519508d.  540,000 DAI will be streamed to the Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) at 0xc657aC882Fb2D6CcF521801da39e910F8519508d starting on 2022-06-01 and ending on 2023-03-15.  250 MKR will be streamed to the Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) at 0x955993Df48b0458A01cfB5fd7DF5F5DCa6443550 starting on 2022-06-01 and ending on 2026-06-01 with a cliff date of 2023-11-23.  Please note the address for the DAI budget distributions is different from the address listed in the budget proposal after the Core Unit Facilitator set up a multi-sig wallet for the Core Unit.  Please see this forum post for more details.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates.  Online PDF Version    Current Events   Endgame Plan Discord Channel MakerDAO co-founder @rune has created a dedicated Discord channel for discussion about the Endgame Plan and designing an immutable future state for MakerDAO, improving governance dynamics and getting MKR holders more involved in the process, along with achieving other goals for success.  Sign up here to join the discussion. To catch up on the Endgame Plan, read rune\u2019s original posts and our summaries of them:   Parts 1 and 2  Summary    Part 3  Summary    Part 4  Summary    Decentralized Voter Committees  Summary    @LongForWisdom also published a summary (Part 1, Part 2) of the Endgame Plan\u2019s structure and goals, together with a useful index.  Ranked Choice Voting Discussion and Resources Flaw in the display of ranked-choice voting outcomes @lyt of the Strategic Finance Core Unit made a post pointing out an issue with the way ranked-choice voting results are displayed in the Maker Governance Voting Portal. Looking at the recently ended MIP40c3-SP69 poll about ratifying the Strategic Finance Core Unit Budget, @lyt points out that the \u201cApprove increased budget\u201d option appears to be far behind the \u201cApprove existing budget only (business as usual)\u201d option in terms of MKR backing, potentially discouraging voters from bothering to put their vote behind an option that looks to be all-but-defeated.  920\u00d7291 30.1 KB  In reality, however, due to the nature of ranked choice voting, the race was closer than it appeared. If the \u201cApprove existing budget only\u201d option had not reached the >50% threshold, any MKR backing the \u201cAbstain\u201d and (if the 50% threshold was still not reached by any of the leading contenders) \u201cReject budget\u201d options would be redistributed to the \u201cApprove existing budget only\u201d and \u201cApprove increased budget\u201d options based on the voters\u2019 second-rank votes. lyt is calling for an investigation into ways to display ranked-choice votes on the Maker Governance Voting Portal that better represent how close (or distant) a vote is. Patrick_J commented that he\u2019d be contacting the DUX team shortly to present lyt\u2019s criticisms. Prioritization Sentiment Poll Results Toward the end of last week\u2019s Governance and Risk call, @prose11 provided information about how the voting breakdown currently stands for the open Prioritization Sentiment polls on Technical Resource Deployment and Collateral Class. These polls will make it easier for GovAlpha to put together a priority framework to ensure that MakerDAO and its Core Units are focusing their energy in the right places.      Technical Resource Deployment Current Results  921\u00d7387 38.9 KB  Collateral Class Current Results  921\u00d7387 43 KB  @tadeo of the Data Insights Core Unit also showed a tool for exploring and simulating ranked-choice Maker votes.  1782\u00d7579 145 KB   This Week in Governance   Weekly MIPs Update #93  Ratification polls, proposals, and pre-MIP discussions.  Executive Vote(s) This week\u2019s Executive is still up on the portal, awaiting participation. You can vote until July 22, 2022, 14:18 UTC. MKR Vesting Transfers - June 22, 2022  DECO-001 MKR Transfer If this executive proposal passes, the following changes will occur within the Maker Protocol: As per their successful MKR vesting proposal, 500 MKR will be transferred to the Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit\u2019s (DECO-001) auditor wallet.  RWF-001 MKR Transfer As per their successful MKR vesting proposal, 152 MKR will be transferred to the Real-World Finance Core Unit\u2019s (RWF-001) auditor wallet. Note that the amount differs from the original proposal due to personnel changes within the Real-World Finance Core Unit. Also note that the distribution address has been amended to remain consistent with the budget implementation described in the most recent Real-World Finance Core Unit DAI budget proposal.
