Fellowship principles: Open process Individual Participation - membership not formal Technical responsibility - fellowship accepts responsibility for all aspects of the ethereum protocol specification - may  take responsibility for related specs proposed to it in the future. Technical competence: the fellowship seeks consensus on proposals where we have the competence Rough consensus and running code - consensus is not unanimity or majority vote, rather, it is based on the combined technical judgement of our participants and our real world experience in implementing and deploying specs Online presence: curated web pages, calendar, links / accesible discussion forums, threaded web interface and email integration In-person work: triannual meetings, two coordinated with DEVCON and ETHCC and one in July Meetups, dicussions, presentations, workshops, hackathons and other relevant activities. Organised by participants on an ad-hoc basis or with the sponsorship of the fellowship Iterative workflow: participants do research, Gain experience, present their work and make proposals / proposals are discussed and reworked, online and in person, until consensus is reached. Question from Australia - what\u2019s the EF supposed to be, what it takes Boris - challenges, reddit miscommunication (karma), communication & accessibility issues from Magicians to easily get the word across. Matt Lockyer - if the technical competence isn\u2019t there there needs to be a channel to not stonewall people that don\u2019t have that knowledge Addy - actively trying to educate Boris - magicians need an education working group Jarrad- authority comes with Education Me & Boris - inclusion, active reach out and finding out that people feel these kinda initiatives are exclusionary - how we change this view and actively reach out to others Nick - how to get consensus, the TAO, ITF processes / Boris - ITF weaknesses (financial support for volunteering and logistics) Boris - how to run a working group Voting is one small fraction of governance - that needs to be more defined These particular meetings do not have finality / documentation in the forum is due to have such finality Lane: suggestion of playbook as ETHGlobal to shard the process a bit Review of the EIP process Types of EIPs -Nick Standard track: core, networking, interface, ERC Informationl . Design issue, general guidelines or info to the community Meta EIP - Procedures, guidelines, changes to decision making process, and tool changes Your EIP draft should contain a discussion round Trying to move to a process where an EIP doesn\u2019t become a discussion forum - magicians is a forum for instance. Any of the users w/any of the authors permission can propose changes - introduce LAST CALL Keeping visibility of EIPs is a challenge - maybe we need working groups for this Funding of EIPs and working groups for people that cannot afford volunteer work ",
