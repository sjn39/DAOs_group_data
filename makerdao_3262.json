                    "content": "Hey all, Some were asking about MakerDAO FLIP Auction stats, so we made a simple analysis and plan to make such reports on a monthly basis. We currently don\u2019t want to spend too much time and build web UIs for Liquidation 1.2 stats, since Liquidations 2.0 are around the corner and we ideally would want to spend more time on them. You can find the underlying data here. Data includes only YTD Auctions. Penalty fees & Vault outcome  Screenshot 2021-02-09 at 18.29.351310\u00d7393 94.7 KB  Unique Bidders  Screenshot 2021-02-10 at 10.34.171112\u00d7546 48.3 KB  Zero Bids  Screenshot 2021-02-10 at 10.33.371332\u00d7512 59.6 KB  Takeaways  All auctions this year (150 in total) cleared with penalty fees collected apart one (UNIV2ETHDAI-A), where 2% out of max. 13% penalty fee was collected. There was only one participant for this UNI LP auction, raising some concerns about how many keepers currently bid on UNI LP auctions. Total amount of liquidation penalties collected this year was 557.768 DAI, 70% of it was collected on ETH-A and ETH-B. Total amount of debt liquidated this year amounts to 4.3m DAI. Liquidated vaults seem to be receiving \u201cappropriate\u201d amounts of collateral back in most of the auctions, apart from liquidated ETH-B vaults and previously mentioned UNI LP vaults. Liquidated ETH-B vaults on average get only 30% of collateral back*. It is unclear why keepers bid much lower on ETH-B auctions compared to ETH-A. There were some irrational high bids on YFI-A, bidding 50-100% above market price. There were about 3.3 unique bidders/liquidators per auction on average, a bit more for ETH-A (3.67) and around 2 for smaller vault types. 42 unique participants (addresses) bidding or kicking auctions this year. 20% or 30 of all auctions kicked had 0 bids. Zero bids were mostly present at ETH-B (31% of all auctions kicked) and UNI-A (89%).  *This estimation is based on the OSM price when auction was KICKED and assumes market price was flat between OSM price that triggered liquidation and final DEAL. In practice the price moves up or down during 6 hours and vaults can get more or less value back. ",

My guess is 0xB00B has money somewhere else considering the strong hitbtc connections.     Jiecut:  I\u2019d like to thank Defi Saver for their great work for allowing bidding on Maker liquidation auctions.   ^this. Many of the wallets shown were using this tool including that 77M guy. (I\u2019m assuming based on the use of dsproxy for doing the tend or dent) If that tool is running smoothly during a dip then I think a larger box would not result in flop auctions because it opens up the opportunity to so much more DAI. It is impossible to quantify how much exactly, but I think we\u2019d be perfectly fine with a 30M box thanks to this UI. ",

Some well capitalized keepers also don\u2019t seem to post many bids. Still, 20m+ range for box would probably make sense. I also think a bit lower ttl and tau should work since most of tend bids that equaled debt+penalty fee happened quite early in current 6h auction duration. Lowering ttl and tau should increase \u201cdaily box capacity\u201d which is good. As for beg I think it wouldn\u2019t hurt to increase it for ETH-B, where auction inefficiency is unusually high. There also seem to be issue with late kicks, but thats separate topic in regards to parameters we are able to adjust. I am planning to make a report tomorrow on yesterday\u2019s auctions outcome and propose some of these changes. ",

We try to do regular maintenance for it (e.g. in terms of adding new collateral types), but often find it hard to give it priority vs work on our main app. In general, if you see any obvious improvements we can make to the auctions UI, please let us know and we\u2019ll do our best to get them in as soon as possible.

Thank you for that post @lix     Jiecut:  I\u2019d like to thank Defi Saver for their great work for allowing bidding on Maker liquidation auctions.   So true J. Thankful to have Defi Saver as well.
