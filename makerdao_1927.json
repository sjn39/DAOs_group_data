TACO is the integration point between the Maker vault and the \u201creal world\u201d. BTCR created TACO following the precedent used in the HVB transaction. See Maker \u201cSacred Rights\u201d below.     Executive Summary This risk assessment evaluates the risks and opportunities present in the BlockTower Credit MIP-6 application, which went to a successful greenlight poll by MKR token holders on August 15, 2022. Vault: The subject proposal is for four DAI revolving credit facilities which will combine for a total debt ceiling of 150MM DAI. The 150MM DAI total capacity will be spread across four vaults/Tinlake pools, of 20MM, 30MM, 30MM, and 70MM DAI, respectively. Collateral: BTCR is seeking approval to originate:  Senior-secured, asset-backed facilities Forward Flow Agreements Whole loans and receivable purchases Structured Credit Products: Investment grade asset-backed securities (bonds)  Senior-Secured Facilities will have terms less than or equal to 3 years, with underlying assets (collateral) ranging in term from 1-72 months. Forward flow arrangements, whole loans, and other asset participations may have terms up to 72 months, though collateral with maturities greater than 48 months are capped at 50% of the facilities total capacity. Underlying assets consist primarily of invoice financing (factoring), trade finance more broadly (e.g. supply chain finance, purchase order finance, inventory finance), and other short-term receivables. Maker\u2019s exposure will always be secured. Structured Credit Products will have an Investment Grade rating and typically maintain a weighted average life (WAL) of less than four years. Structured Credit Products fall into three major buckets: consumer ABS, auto ABS, and CLO. See Asset Mix - Description & Overview in Part II for a description of the potential transaction pipeline. BTCR will partially execute the transactions on Centrifuge\u2019s Tinlake protocol. Broadly, Centrifuge\u2019s Tinlake protocol is a collection of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that accepts digital representations of real-world assets (in the form of ERC-721 non-fungible tokens). See www.centrifuge.io. The illustration below provides a high-level overview of the transactions. More detailed transaction and cash flow diagrams are below in this Risk Assessment.  1600\u00d71022 166 KB  Credit Structure: Maker will benefit from a minimum credit enhancement or subordination of 30%, i.e. a TIN requirement of 30% on each Vault. This means that BTCR will first absorb any losses on any Vault (including expenses) before Maker. Or restated, BTCR will have, in aggregate, at least $64 million of its own capital (in the form of DAI) in the first loss position. The capital will be distributed across the 4 vaults on a pro rata basis. BTCR intends to overfund each vault to ensure that the Minimum TIN Percentage is maintained. BTCR will manage at its own discretion the amount of any overfunding and its allocation among the 4 Vaults. BTCR\u2019s overfunding will mean that Maker\u2019s exposure in a Vault is proportionately reduced to the extent of such overfunding. Implementation: BTCR will utilize Centrifuge\u2019s Tinlake smart contracts, together with MIP 21 and the Centrifuge adapter (MIP 22), to mint DAI against DROP tokens (senior obligation tokens) locked into the Centrifuge adapter (MIP22). BTCR will only mint DROP Tokens against eligible collateral (to be verified by Ankura Trust, the same collateral confirmation agent used for the HVB transaction) and subject to maintaining the minimum TIN (junior obligation) threshold of 30%. The Tinlake smart contracts will prohibit the minting of DAI from the Maker vault if the minimum TIN is not available in the Tinlake smart contract. Risks: The primary risk inherent to this proposal is A) the fixed and B) low rate. We can refer to the former as duration/interest rate risk and the latter as underpricing.   Idiosyncratic risk factors include scaling risk, liquidity risk, servicing risk, active management risk, fraud risk, cross-collateralization risk, and stablecoin conversion risk.  General risk factors include recession risk and consumer loan exposure risk.  Mitigants These risks are ameliorated by significant and Centrifuge-enforced credit enhancement via DROP/TIN ratio, junior risk retention by BTCR, BTCR\u2019s alignment with Maker by virtue of its sizeable MKR position and public intention to retain it, the excess spread of BTCR\u2019s assets over its liabilities to Maker (debt service on Maker vaults), and generally short durations at both the end-asset and asset-backed facility levels. Opportunities: The primary opportunities include a fully on-chain implementation and securitization via Centrifuge\u2019s Tinlake smart contracts, deep alignment at both the facility and organization levels, a wholesale lending model (underwrite the underwriter), short-term and self-liquidating (safer) asset exposures, revenue scale, and a turnkey solution. This deal provides Maker with an out-of-the-box asset-backed yield solution with 150MM of current capacity and the potential to scale, potentially with BTCR as a MetaDAO anchor, should MKR token holders approve this structure. Improving on some earlier RWA on-boardings, this structure contemplates material credit enhancement (30%) for Maker, alignment via MKR tokens, shorter term assets, full collateral security, and greater on-chain implementation.  Upgrades to the Deal Since Publishing the Term Sheet  Since publishing the draft Term sheet two weeks ago, we have provided for six key changes to enhance Maker\u2019s risk-adjusted return:   Cap Longer-Term Exposures: BTCR agreed to cap the portion of Maker\u2019s facility used to originate end assets longer than 48 months at 50%. This mitigates liquidity and interest rate risk. This materially improves the risk profile of Maker\u2019s exposure.   Eliminate Non-US/Non-Canada Jurisdictional Exposure: BTCR cannot originate assets outside of the US or Canada. This materially improves the risk profile of Maker\u2019s exposure.   Add Structured Credit Products to Eligible Collateral: Due to recent changes in market conditions, it has become accretive for BTCR to buy investment grade asset-backed securities alongside the origination of assets directly. BTCR will utilize one of its four vaults for purchase of such bonds. Bonds are highly liquid, diversified exposures with proven statistical performance. This materially improves the risk profile of Maker\u2019s exposure.   BTCR Commitment to Holding MKR: In an effort to further reinforce the alignment between BTCR and Maker, BTCR has stated an intention to maintain its MKR position over the course of the loan. See the forum post and public commitment from BlockTower Capital\u2019s CEO, Ari Paul, here. This improves the risk profile of Maker\u2019s exposure and sets a standard for DeFi <> RWAs.   Removed Non-BT Junior Risk Holders: Whereas previously BTCR could share the 30% first loss with external funds or originators, BTCR is now required to retain the entirety itself. This materially improves the risk profile of Maker\u2019s exposure.   No direct oil & gas investments   Finally, due to the addition of structured credit products to the eligible collateral base, BTCR will use four instead of five vaults (five vaults being originally contemplated in the draft term sheet).  Recommendation: If evaluated purely as a one-off, arms-length transaction, this opportunity under-prices the embedded risk. As per market comparables (credit fund back leverage and senior secured lines to trade finance lenders), a similar facility in the real world (\u201cmarket\u201d) would be floating rate at about SOFR + 2.75%, 65% LTV, entail a 90% advance rate against assets, and be more punitive around eligibility criteria (credit approval needed, asset types, industry types, single-borrower concentrations etc.). Comparable fixed rate facilities would price at roughly a 175 bps spread to this facility as proposed, or closer to 5.50-6.0%. With that said, Maker is not the real world. The basic collateral characteristics of this proposal are an improvement on previous illiquid RWA collateral vaults. Additionally, the proposal does add diversity, scale, and resilience to the collateral backing the peg. Further, given BTCR\u2019s crossover TradFi/crypto essence, material MKR and CFG holdings, and potential to serve a more integral role in Maker\u2019s future via the Spring Cluster ProtectorDAO, one might consider the arrangement between Maker and BTCR as something closer to a long-term, strategic partnership. As such, it may be more appropriate to consider the quantitative, immediate risks against counter-balancing qualitative, long-term, and strategic upsides, though we leave that judgment to MKR holders.  Risks vs. Opportunities  Primary Risks: Ordered from Idiosyncratic (deal-specific) to General.   Fixed Rate: Duration risk is the sensitivity of the value of an asset to changes in interest rates. Though the BTCR facility has a revolving period of 36 months and a maturity of 60 months, BTCR retains the right to originate and thus Maker maintains exposure to Whole Loans and Receivables (up to 50% of the debt ceiling) with terms up to 72 months. Upon expiration, to the extent that credit spreads have blown out or these assets were fixed rate and in the interim rates have risen, Maker may have to contend with mark-to-market losses/discount to par on these longer-dated assets if it elects to liquidate. Finally, given the broadly volatile macroeconomic environment, evidenced by high levels of inflation and a rapid increase (and expected continuation in increases) in long-end rates, a fixed rate instrument may be an unusually attractive structure for BTCR and an unusually unappealing structure for Maker. Typically, senior secured facilities to originators of trade finance assets and other short-term receivables are floating rate and priced off of either LIBOR or SOFR.   Liquidity Risk: RWAs are illiquid, especially private credit such as senior secured facilities, whole loans, and receivables. Though BTCR\u2019s obligations to Maker entail a 48 months maturity, BTCR retains the right to originate directly or originate as the collateral for senior secured facilities assets longer than 48 months. These longer-dated exposures pose liquidity risk to Maker, especially in the case that A) interest rates move materially over the interim or B) it seeks to move to Eagle or Phoenix stance (0-25% RWA exposure).   Stablecoin Liquidity in the PSM: The Maker PSM is undergoing a material rebalancing as a result of various approved and pending MIP proposals. This may, under certain circumstances, reduce the availability of USDC in the PSM (taking into account other USDC demand in the PSM).   BTCR and Exchange Platform Risk: BTCR will, through its Coinbase or other exchange platform account, perform the required DAI <-> Stablecoin <-> USD exchanges for each Issuer SPV. This introduces BTCR, Coinbase, and other exchange platform risk to the cash-flow mechanics as US$, Stablecoin or DAI may be trapped in the event of a bankruptcy or other similar credit event. BTCR is acting in this role as several of the prominent exchanges wanted to face BTCR instead of each Issuer SPV or otherwise required high daily account balances. We do not have access to BTCR\u2019s account agreements with Coinbase or other exchange platforms and, as such, cannot assess its contractual relationship to Coinbase or such other exchange platforms. Specifically, to understand whether or not Coinbase or other exchange platforms hold assets as a custodian and in separate accounts.   Low Rate/Lost Spread: In our diligence, we found that a comparable facility in the real world would be priced floating at around SOFR + 2.25%. A fixed rate equivalent would price at around 5.25-5.75%.   Scaling Risk: BTCR, as an institution, has yet to establish a track record of originating, underwriting, and servicing credit assets. As such, there lies some risk in ramping the operations and infrastructure to support this effort. Though the principals of BTCR (Kevin Miao, Jack Carlisle) have each individually demonstrated domain expertise in managing portfolios of structured credit, the duo have not jointly executed a business plan.   Active Management/Maintenance Risk: BTCR will be originating small-ish facilities and whole loans/receivables, each of which requires an immense amount of manual up-front underwriting as well as ongoing portfolio surveillance. The high-touch maintenance overhead is material. Furthermore, should the credit of the portfolio erode and exposures need to be unwound, the complexity involved in working out and transitioning collections is high.   Servicing Risk: Part of BTCR\u2019s focus is on \u201cemerging\u201d originators, or those who are too nascent to access bank financing but mature enough to have outgrown venture financing. As such, these originators cannot access securitization markets and remain instrumental in the servicing of their underlying assets. Given the over-reliance on the originator for high-touch servicing, should the originator face distress, its potential financial distress represents material risk to the ongoing performance of the underlying credits.   Fraud Risk: A binary and material risk in all of trade finance. BTCR will have neither the resources nor the insight required to inspect receivables for legitimacy, so it will rely on representations from originators to mitigate fraud risk. As such, fraud from BTCR\u2019s borrowers\u2019 customers remains a risk.   Recession Risk: The US is in a technical recession (defined by two subsequent quarters of negative GDP growth). The end-borrowers that BTCR will face are often B2B or B2C operations. With looming inflation and the specter of rate increases, the income/debt service ratios of these businesses\u2019 customers may increase accordingly. This may inhibit such customers\u2019 ability to service their loans.   Portfolio Composition: Maker\u2019s pool of end assets cannot benefit from the same diversification or credit characteristics as a securitization, or specifically ABS bonds (though 70MM of the exposure will in fact be deployed towards ABS bonds). If it did, the assets in the BTCR pipeline would have simply been pooled and securitized. BTCR\u2019s originations must necessarily be of lower quality, either because originators are not well-established, assets are not sufficiently fungible, or potentially just because assets are too short-dated/heterogeneous for securitization to be financially reasonable. As such, the composition of the portfolio will be lumpier and of generally lower credit quality than an ABS securitization tradeable in public markets. An ABS tranche with better risk characteristics may thus provide better risk-adjusted return.   Cross Collateralization Risk: BTCR will be minting DAI across four different vaults. These vaults are only conditionally cross-collateralized/cross-defaulted (see Portfolio Events of Default in Mitigants below for more detail), as opposed to crossed at the outset. Cross default can be a valuable structural enhancement for a lender because it causes the borrower to default on all obligations if one part of the portfolio defaults. Cross collateralization can also be useful to a lender because it will have recourse to a wider range of assets in the case of deterioration of one part of the portfolio. Finally, a borrower who is constrained by a cross-collateralization/cross-default covenant is primed to take less risk, lest they turn over the keys to the entire portfolio upon credit erosion.   Conditions Precedent/Execution Risk: The various parties will execute the primary finance agreements in advance of the Maker Governance Poll. Execution prior to the Governance Poll will permit the Executive Spell to point to signed agreements. The primary finance agreements will only be effective and binding on the parties upon the approval of the Executive Spell. See Collateral Onboarding Operations Guide. As of the date of this Risk Assessment, there is a risk that the custodian of the investment grade structured credit may not yet have executed the account control agreement by the date of the Governance Poll. The delay will have resulted from the custodian\u2019s on-boarding process and not any particular concern with an account control agreement. Such agreements are standard and customary for the creation of perfected security interests under Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code.    Mitigants: Fixed Rate/Low Rate/Lost Spread BTCR\u2019s Subordinated Capital Maker\u2019s principal protection is that BTCR\u2019s 30% junior capital is first applied against any and all losses before the Maker vault suffers any losses. Further, all fees, conversion basis risk (USD <> Stablecoins), conversion costs and other costs are first borne by BTCR in the junior tranche. The Tinlake Protocol\u2019s smart contract functionality enforces this subordinated position. If BTCR does not maintain the 30% Minimum TIN Percentage in the Tinlake Protocol, the Tinlake Protocol will prohibit BTCR from accessing funds in Tinlake Protocol until the BTCR tops-up the Minimum TIN Percentage. Finally, BTCR will not be able to recover its investment in the TIN until BTCR has repaid the Maker vault all of the principal and accrued Stability Fees. Commitment to Retain MKR Tokens Ari Paul, CIO of BlockTower LP, has publicly committed to retaining BlockTower\u2019s 11,950 MKR position over the course of the loan. BTCR\u2019s commitment vis-a-vis BTCR\u2019s public attestation to align its interests with Maker over the course of the loan while concurrently setting a standard, we hope, for DeFi lending alignment. Further, in an effort to reinforce our alignment between BTCR and Maker, BTCR has publicly stated that it will maintain its MKR position over the course of the loan, per BlockTower Capital\u2019s CIO, Ari Paul, here; BTCR\u2019s public commitment intends to improve the risk profile of Maker\u2019s exposure both in the short and long term. Note: Though the substantial alignment between MakerDAO and BTCR via this commitment is a net mitigant, it may introduce new risks. To the extent that truancy remains an issue during MKR governance activities, BT may be able to push through proposals that may favor BTCR at the expense of other stakeholders. Investment in Personnel/Maker BTCR has, over the preceding four months, dedicated 1.5x FTE to structuring not only its own deal but also to helping Maker achieve broader community goals. For example, BTCR has provided detailed feedback to the community on the feasibility of certain RWA collateral onboardings, including OPM ATDC, Pando, and Monetalis. More contemporarily, a la \u201cA North Star - DAI as the Destination\u201d, BTCR is, via its origination pipeline, actively exploring an opportunity to embed DAI as a medium of exchange in a crypto credit card. In this way, BTCR has demonstrated good faith contribution to Maker and incurred significant cost on initiatives not directly related to its MIP-6 (though of course directly related to its MKR investment). The Costs of Structuring on the Frontier BTCR has spent in excess of $1MM to structure a fully compliant on-chain securitization structure (vs. ~100K for a simple off-chain structure). In other deals, Maker has either paid these costs directly or these costs were defrayed by dollars extracted before Maker\u2019s return (i.e. origination and servicing fees). BTCR was adamant that it bear such costs as a sign of good-faith and long-term orientation. Because BTCR sought to embed as much of the structure natively on-chain as possible, it incurred a \u201cfrontiersman tax\u201d that past counter-parties did not have to and that future counter-parties may benefit from. Though BTCR benefits uniquely from its existing infrastructure, security, and personnel, it will incur binary inefficiencies such as token vs. CUSIP custody and USD <> DAI swap slippage (though it hopes to leverage the PSM to alleviate this). BTCR hopes that this foundation serves as a template and can be replicated on future deals. Liquidity Risk Since publishing the original term sheet, there have been several material improvements which address liquidity risk directly.   Cap on Longer Exposures: Only 50% of the 150MM DC may be used to fund assets with longer than a 48-month maturity.   Structured Credit Collateral Addition: BTCR\u2019s 70MM vault will be used to originate investment grade ABS bonds. ABS bonds are publicly traded and highly liquid. As such, should Maker want to liquidate, liquidating these bonds can occur more quickly and with less execution risk than senior facilities, whole loans, or receivables.   Non-US/Non-Canadian exposure is now at 0%.   Though senior secured facilities are generally illiquid and would likely require a buyback from BTCR should Maker want to get out, whole loans can likely be sold with reasonable execution. Finally, at any time 48 months from the date of the Executive Spell, Maker (acting by means of a governance poll at the time) will have the right to request that BTCR wind-down one or more of the Maker vaults, sell the assets underlying the DROP tokens associated with that vault, and repay that vault (in DAI) using the proceeds of the wind-down. Stablecoin Liquidity in the PSM BTCR seeks the optionality to swap DAI into USDC, USDP or other stablecoins for the purpose of acquiring US dollars to fund underlying loans. From a Maker perspective, as the obligations to the Maker vaults are denominated in DAI and the Tinlake Protocol accepts DAI for purposes of repayment to the Maker vault, this optionality does not have an impact on Maker. BTCR and Exchange Platform Risk To address potential BTCR bankruptcy or similar credit risk, BTCR, as servicer, will be required to sweep and convert, on a daily basis, any principal and interest received from the originator in respect of the underlying loans. BTCR will pay to the respective Issuer SPV\u2019s bank account any US$ required to be set aside for payment of Issuer US$ expenses. BTCR will, through its Coinbase or other exchange account, convert the remaining US$ into DAI, and then transfer the DAI to the Issuer SPV\u2019s Fireblocks wallet. BTCR bankruptcy/credit risk is partially mitigated by the daily sweep. Further, as BTCR will have previously sold the loan to the Issuer SPV under the Master Participation Agreement, BTCR will be holding such amounts \u201cin trust\u201d for the Issuer SPV. However, in the event of a BTCR bankruptcy, Ankura Trust (as indenture trustee) will have to go to the Bankruptcy Court to request a release of any \u201ctrapped cash\u201d as such cash belongs to the Issuer SPV. The preferred alternative is to have each Issuer SPV maintain its own account with an exchange broker. However, several of the prominent exchange brokers either required material daily cash balances or required the interaction with BTCR directly (not indirectly through the wholly-owned Issuer SPV). In terms of exchange platform risk, BTCR will use either Coinbase or another exchange platform. A daily cash sweep at the US$ level and BTCR\u2019s ability to switch exchange platforms will partially mitigate the risk as BTCR can make prompt adjustments. However, in respect of funds held on a platform at any moment in time, there remains a partially unmitigated bankruptcy/credit risk. Ultimately, BTCR will bear first-loss exposure through its TIN holdings in the event of any conversion losses. Scaling Risk Portfolio Composition: Scaling risk is mostly relevant to senior secured facilities, which will compose roughly 40% of Maker\u2019s exposure. For the remainder of the exposure, whole loans and structured credit products, scaling risk is less potent. Credit Expertise: BTCR\u2019s Credit team contains a total of 30 years structured credit experience, ameliorating the risk that BTCR cannot scale reasonably. Growing Personnel Base: BTCR has to date hired six credit professionals and plans to hire four more to augment existing operations. BTCR benefits from direct liaison with BTCR\u2019s operations, compliance, and legal teams. Servicing Risk Systemized Automation: BTCR\u2019s funding of a given loan is contingent upon the borrower\u2019s principals agreeing to drive towards automation of servicing infrastructure. Should BTCR have to foreclose on collateral and step into the borrower\u2019s shoes, an automated servicing workflow is more transferrable and represents a less severe transition than a manual process in which the borrower\u2019s personnel were instrumental. Corporate Cash Buffer Covenant: Require that the originator maintain, at the corporate level, a certain amount of cash (relative to the borrowing base) to maintain servicing infrastructure should the corporate entity die. Backup Servicer: Where BTCR faces an asset originator directly, as is the case with senior secured facilities, BTCR identifies and arranges at the outset a backup servicer. A backup servicer will spring into action, managing collections, in the case that the primary servicer is unable or unwilling to. Fraud Risk Representations: Originators are required to provide representations that fraud is not present. In the case that a borrower does originate a fraudulent transaction, BTCR retains a conditional put to sell back the loan to the borrower, which they must accept. This condition applies to forward flow and senior secured facilities. Due Diligence: As BTCR does not originate loans directly, it diligences its borrowers with an exhaustive KYC/AML check, scrutiny of a borrower\u2019s fraud detection mechanisms, and an analysis of how a borrower makes credit decisions with regard to historical fraud realizations. It will combine these fraud-related data points and build in some buffer of expected fraud going forward. BTCR will typically engage experienced legal counsel for purposes of due diligence on the underlying borrower and credit. Risk Retention: Originators bear the first-loss on any fraudulent originations, both with regard to any losses and any repurchase requirements. Business Continuity: The motivation to minimize fraud is instrumental to the originator\u2019s capacity to stay in business. This is a figure followed closely by any current and future credit and equity providers, making it existentially important to the originator\u2019s ability to grow and prosper. Recession Risk Alternative Lending Anti-Fragility: When economic or credit conditions erode, traditional financial institutions tend to tighten lending standards and reduce origination volumes. This creates an opportunity for BTCR, an alternative lender, to attract higher quality credits who are now excluded from more traditional financing channels. Credit Enhancement: Maker is protected against broad-based economic contraction by a 30% subordination (BTCR\u2019s junior capital). Sector Exposures: BTCR maintains a healthy non-cyclical exposures in the portfolio. Active Management/Maintenance Risk Automated Reporting: Rather than receiving a patchwork of PDFs and Excel spreadsheets conveying the performance of the underlying credits, BTCR will pull on borrower APIs to aggregate performance data. These inputs will be wrapped into an easily ingested, comprehensive surveillance report to be published on the Maker forums. Credit Expertise: BTCR\u2019s Credit team contains a total of 30 years structured credit experience. All team members have experience in sourcing, origination, underwriting, surveillance, servicing, asset management Work-Out/Recovery Experience: Kevin/Jack have previous experience (15 years combined) working out bad loans and maximizing portfolio recoveries. Portfolio Composition Skin in the Game: Though BTCR may originate a lumpier portfolio with single-borrower or sector concentrations, BTCR is shortchanging itself should the composition pose outsized risks\u2014BTCR retains a 30% first-loss exposure to the portfolio. End-Asset Diversification: Though Maker\u2019s exposures might be lumpy (e.g. two 30MM senior-secured facilities to single borrowers + four 17.5MM ABS bonds), the assets underlying those exposures are diversified significantly. As such, the binary risk is somewhat mitigated by the look-through mitigation. Duration Risk: Portfolio-Wide Asset Maturity Limits: BTCR is not able to originate end-assets that collectively sum to more than 50% of the debt ceiling that have maturities longer than 48 months. This limit encapsulates the underlying assets which collateralize Senior Secured Facilities, the forward-flow arrangements, whole loans, and receivables that BTCR will purchase outright, and the structured credit products that BTCR will purchase. Cross Collateralization/Cross Default Risk: Though the portfolio is not cross-collateralized, Portfolio Events of Default (PEOD) to some extent mitigate this risk. The documents contemplate 2 PEODs - a debt service coverage covenant and a minimum vault performance covenant. With respect to the former, if the monthly interest collections on BTCR\u2019s assets plummet below 1.5x its debt obligations to Maker, the portfolio goes into default until BTCR cures the breach. With respect to the latter, in the case that 3-of-4 vaults do default, a portfolio-wide cross collateralization and cross-default will be triggered. Because such breaches throw the entire portfolio into default, in the case of severe deterioration, Maker is likely to benefit from cross-default. BTCR will be required to maintain a subordinated position of at least 30% of the amount in each Vault (as opposed to 30% on an aggregate basis). Finally, BTCR\u2019s addition of the $70 million IG structured credit vault further tempers the cross-collateralization risk as the risk now is focused on 3 vaults with a total of $80 million). While a traditional cross-collateralization/default may bring security to Maker, it may drive an adverse selection issue for BTCR. Said differently, BTCR may find it more difficult to attract quality credits if it is subject to all of its collateral being cross-collateralized. This is because, in the case of cross-collateralization/default, a given borrower may experience a funding freeze due to factors completely unrelated to performance on its own obligations. This will seem unfair relative to an identical opportunity without the associated burden of cross-collateralization. A cross-collateralization default may also present more complicated decision-making for Maker in respect of vault redemption. Where there are multiple vaults, it may be easier to redeem a single discrete vault instead of the entire portfolio. Finally, in thinking about portfolio composition, rather than a homogenous 150MM, the four vaults will indeed retain different collateral. Due to this heterogeneity, it may make sense to compartmentalize the asset bases and treat them distinctly. In some cases, senior back leverage for credit funds does entail cross-collateralization. The significant junior capital pledged by BTCR will to some extent mitigate this tradition. Conditions Precedent/Execution Risk If the account control agreement is executed by the Governance Poll, it is proposed that the signed account control agreement be a condition precedent to minting DAI. Ankura Trust, as verification agent, will confirm whether or not BTCR satisfied the condition precedent. Further, BTCR will have to provide a confirmation letter from BTCR\u2019s external counsel regarding the same. Because such conditions are required to mint DAI, MakerDAO is not exposed to risk of loss of capital if the condition is not satisfied. However, to the extent that BTCR is unable to satisfy the condition precedent, Maker may experience some community criticism as a result of the internal resources spent on evaluating and structuring this facility without a final execution. We consider the risk of non-execution of the account control agreement to be low. Note For additional color on mitigating factors, please refer to the \u201cInvestment Process\u201d section (specifically: Risk and Asset Management) of this risk evaluation below.  Primary Opportunities    Deep Alignment: Maker and BTCR are aligned on a few levels. First, Maker benefits from BTCR\u2019s significant first-loss alignment (30% TIN token retention) in the proposed transaction. Second, BTCR maintains an MKR position of 11,950 MKR, making it a ~top 15 MKR holder and thus aligned not only at a debt level but also a longer-term equity level. The significant tie-ups between the protocol and BTCR should bring comfort to token holders that BTCR should act in Maker\u2019s best interest: origination of good assets, pricing risk appropriately or even opportunistically, optimizing servicing, and maximizing work-outs and recoveries in the case of credit erosion of the portfolio.  On Chain Implementation: As proposed, this structure utilizes Centrifuge\u2019s Tinlake smart contracts for the tokenization and securitization of the underlying credit assets. This means that structural elements such as minimum credit enhancement, cash flow waterfalls, and seniority in proceeds/recoveries can be enforced completely by code. The structure further innovates by using a Cayman Islands foundation company, TACO, to serve as the real world integration point for Maker and protect Maker\u2019s real world interests. Centrifuge\u2019s Tinlake protocol does not eliminate all of the \u201creal world\u201d activities, as servicing, payment, and conversion of fiat denominated obligations remain. However, Centrifuge\u2019s Tinlake smart contracts eliminate a significant 3rd party \u201ctrust layer\u201d from the process and embed that process in code.  Wholesale Lending: MakerDAO is underwriting a lender as opposed to each and every underlying asset being originated. By scrutinizing BTCR itself rather than the nitty-gritty of the eventual asset pool, MakerDAO benefits from infrastructural leverage\u2026i.e. underwrite the underwriter\u2019s capacity to do its job well, build a commercial/legal/technical structure once, sculpt eligibility criteria to protect Maker holders, and drip additional funding to the underwriter as the vault seasons, the underwriter performs, and token holders show an appetite to scale with them.  Scale: The proposal represents the opportunity to onboard $150MM of real world assets. Should the community be satisfied with the performance of the initial vault, the opportunity exists to scale up exposure accordingly.  Strategic Partnership: BTCR has conceived its credit fund specifically to connect real world assets to on-chain liquidity. In fact, principals Ari Paul and Matthew Goetz are, to some extent, betting the firm on the long-term viability of marrying real world underwriting (off-chain) and accretive DeFi financing (on-chain). BTCR\u2019s familiarity with the personnel and processes of Maker, it\u2019s material risk retention of MKR and CFG tokens, as well as its bespoke reason for existence (bring TradFi rigor to DeFi capital markets) set the stage for a potentially long and fruitful partnership (depending on your predilections, that this deal smells different than an arms-length credit facility could be a feature or a bug). BTCR may serve as a viable candidate for a Protector MetaDAO.  Turn-Key Solution: BTCR will provide an out-of-the-box yield solution for MakerDAO. On Maker\u2019s behalf, BTCR will originate assets, retain a 30% junior position in those assets, master service those assets, and special service those assets. MakerDAO can, through this arrangement, diversify its capital markets approach by leaning on specialists with expertise in production, maintenance, and recovery of real world yield.  Asset Characteristics: In this proposal, end assets eligible for DAI financing are short-term and often self-liquidating asset-backed loans. Short-term assets are easier to liquidate and suffer less from fluctuations in interest rates. Self-liquidating loans amortize Maker\u2019s principal more quickly, reducing balloon risk (risk the originator covers interest over the course of the loan but defaults on the bullet principal payment at the end).  Legitimacy: BTCR represents a vehicle for enhancing the Maker brand in the mainstream financial world. Because BTCR is a fully registered investment advisor with the SEC and has as LPs, clean energy funds, public pension funds, institutional asset managers, venture capital and private equity firms, insurance companies, and family offices, this potential partnership further reinforces Maker as a legitimate and established DeFi institution compared to the more speculative ecosystem that surrounds it.

Diagram #2 outlines the cash flow from the underlying borrower up through the Maker vault.

When BTCR proposes assets to mint DROP and TIN tokens against, Ankura Trust, the verification agent, will ensure that those assets are eligible for funding in accordance with the loan criteria set forth in the Master Participation Agreement. Ankura Trust is retained to provide an independent review of each asset pledged for participation. If assets conform, Ankura will verify their compliance with the Loan Eligibility Criteria. Subsequently, BTCR will mint DROP and TIN tokens against those assets, securitizing the asset via Centrifuge\u2019s Tinlake smart contracts. DROP tokens are then pledged as collateral against which BTCR may mint DAI. Payback mechanism and frequency: Whenever the underlying assets (whole loans, structured credit products, or debt facilities) pay back either principal or interest, those payments are remitted through the Servicer to Tinlake and automatically to the appropriate Maker Vault. The Servicer will sweep cash daily and the integration between Tinlake and Maker allows for automatic repayments (as described in currently implemented MIP21 and MIP22). As a result, the payback frequency to Maker will match the payback frequency of the underlying assets. Illustrating this concept, if we consider a 9% yielding investment-grade structured credit product that pays back $100 of principal and $9 of interest in one month, Servicer will remit the 109 Dai into the Tinlake protocol. Tinlake will then execute its waterfall calculation and automatically transfer 72.8 Dai into the Maker vault and smart contracts for Maker\u2019s 70% senior interest at a 4% stability fee. Liquidation: In the event of normal operation, where there are no defaults and principal and interest is continually paid, MIP21 and MIP22 (collectively referred to as the Tinlake Maker Integration) will automatically redeem DROP for Dai that will be transferred into the Maker vault. In the event of an event of default, the TACO director will take instruction from the Maker token holders (through a governance poll) on whether to exercise TACO\u2019s rights and remedies. These rights and remedies include acceleration and liquidation of the underlying assets. As principal and interest is returned as a consequence of this liquidation, DAI is automatically transferred to Tinlake and then to the Maker vaults. Unlike traditional Maker vaults, liquidation will be a \u201creal world\u201d activity given the underlying real world assets. Maker will, however, have control over its vaults and can, pursuant to a Maker governance poll, reduce the debt ceiling on each to zero.  Maker Governance and \u201cSacred Rights\u201d TACO is the integration point between MakerDAO governance and the real world. The Articles of Association of TACO provide that the TACO director (a person independent from BTCR) may only make certain decisions on certain matters with the prior approval of Maker governance (\u201cMaker Sacred Rights\u201d). Maker\u2019s Sacred Rights are intended to preserve the as agreed and implemented transaction structure. Maker\u2019s Sacred Rights include:  Increases or decreases in the aggregate Debt Ceiling or any change in the amounts allocated to the four (4) Maker vaults Changes in the Stability Fee Changes in the Loan Eligibility Criteria Amendments to any of the agreements that trigger non-compliance with the Loan Eligibility Criteria Replacement of BlockTower Credit Fund LP as servicer under the Servicing Agreement, unless BlockTower Credit Fund LP has defaulted on any of its contractual obligations under the Master Participation Agreement or the Servicing Agreement Any action to be taken by TACO as a Tokenholder Representative under the Indenture or the Tokenholder Representative letter agreement Any amendment or modification to, or termination of, the Basic Documents The waiver of any default or potential event of default under any Basic Document Exercise of any rights and/or remedies under the Basic Documents, to which TACO is a party or in respect of which, TACO consents (directly or indirectly) Any amendment to the memorandum or articles of association of TACO Any discretions of the Company exercised in connection with a Wind-Down Event under the Indenture  @BlockTower @strat-fin-core-unit @collateral-core-unit ",

                    "content": "Hey Welsh - thank you for taking a read-through of the risk assessment! There is at least 30% junior capital in every transaction, which is not funded through Maker but by BlockTower\u2019s proprietary capital. The intention here is to provide significant credit enhancement and principal protection to Maker\u2019s senior position, while aligning our interests with Maker long term (i.e. we are not paid back unless Maker\u2019s principal and interest has been paid down). This junior buffer is encoded through the Centrifuge smart contracts (which will not allow us to issue DROP tokens/draw additional funding from Maker unless the junior capital is maintained at 30%), as well as documented in the off-chain legal agreements with Ankura Trust (the Loan Verification Agent in the Maker <> HVB transaction). We totally hear you on the junior capital point of Metadaos and, agree, it shouldn\u2019t be funded by Maker\u2019s surplus buffer whatsoever. In this case, BlockTower provides the at-risk junior capital across every deal that we source, underwrite, and bring to Maker. In the future, particularly in the Spring MetaDAO where we are affiliated and helping Maker arrange deals (including some of the revenue share deals and money market/AAA funds a la MIP90), any Metadao junior capital would provide additional protection across all RWA (in addition to BlockTower\u2019s own capital on each individual deal). TBD how the community chooses to fund junior capital but, again, we\u2019re aligned with you that it should come from funds outside the Maker core surplus buffer. Let me know if I can provide any additional clarification - happy to clarify anything that may be confusing! ",

Also, given our capital is at risk, we underwrite investments to an expected positive return (and thus no principal impairment on the junior tranche). Furthermore, the Centrifuge structure is more akin to a credit line that requires us to inject cash into the Tinlake pool (via the junior TIN tranche) if any losses were to occur.

No TradFi party would do this transaction any where near the proposed terms. MKR voters need to decide is Maker should funds transactions that are potentially worth 80 cents on the dollar in the real world.  Is this a wise and sustainable lending model? Some key terms for senior fund back leverage for funds making senior secured loans. (1) Rate proposal 4% fixed versus TradFi market is SOFR +350-650, or 7-10%.  TradFi would also charge commitment fees and unused line fees which are not in the proposal. (2)  Advance rate proposal 30% versus TradFi market of 50-60% advance rate. (3)  Proposal doesnt back  all deals in transaction with common subordination versus TradFi would require subordination backing all the transaction assets.  This is a big difference, significantly weakening the credit support of the proposed deal and would not be done in TradFi (4)  Revolving Period proposal 48 months versus TradFi market of 24 months (5)  Key Enforcement terms - the Proposal is very weak here.  TradFi has cash custody with DACAs over all fund accounts, full first-priority UCCs on all entities, pledges of equity in any underlying SPVs holding collateral. The structure is really convoluted and the actual security package Maker is getting  and is very indirect and difficult to legally enforce on. Key question is how much cooperation do they need from Blocktower or related parties to enforce if needed. Would a court see Maker as having a direct, enforceable interest or is some intermediary entity going to stand between? (6)  Proposal has most key functions performed by Blocktower.  In TradFi most key functions not performed by borrower such as custody of the assets, verification agent, managing back-up servicers. Can Maker enforce on collateral/cash/bank accounts? (7)  Personal guarantees - none in proposal.  In TradFi usually require personal guarantees for bad acts for small fund (particularly with 1st time managers) (8)  Events of Default and Performance Triggers are weak in the Proposal.  In TradFi EoDs and Performance Triggers typically have Minimum TNW: requiring $10mm+ of minimum tangible net worth in any fund borrower (if they are not cross collateralizing, this would apply to each transaction). There would also be excess spread ratios, cash collection ratios, leverage ratios which are not in the Proposal (9) If deals are not cross collateralized (as in this Proposal) then the lender would have their own specific covenants with respect to the underlying portfolio collateral. They also underwrite to the lender\u2019s covenants and put language around not being able to modify or change those. If not cross collateralized, the bank is coming in as senior lender in an A/B structure: the bank has a lot of control of the deal and approval rights over any amendments etc. (10)  these TradFi deals are typically reserved for funds/investment professionals with significant prior private credit fund experience with demonstrable track records.  The folks making this proposal lack such prior experience and track record. ",

                    "content": "Hi @Eumenes, thanks for the dialogue, please see our response below.  (1) Rate proposal 4% fixed versus TradFi market is SOFR +350-650, or 7-10%. TradFi would also charge commitment fees and unused line fees which are not in the proposal.  Would you be able to clarify the type of line you are referring to? Without specifics, a comparison would be difficult to draw. There are forms of fund-level leverage that support deeply subordinate debt positions (like unrated mezzanine residuals). In this arrangement, Maker is only advancing against investment grade structured credit or the most senior piece of a senior facility / loan pool. In addition, BlockTower has accrued extensive legal bills and spent significant hours building effective protections for Maker without certainty of execution. In TradFi, this process would not have been as costly and certainty of execution would have been guaranteed before legal bills are accrued. Therefore, BlockTower is disadvantaged versus a comparable TradFi borrower.  (2) Advance rate proposal 30% versus TradFi market of 50-60% advance rate.  The 50-60% advance rate would be inaccurate for this type of collateral. Maker is advancing against risk remote collateral. 50-60% junior capital might be required for deeply subordinated, risky mezzanine, and residual positions, but certainly not credit that fits within our underwriting guidelines.  (3) Proposal doesnt back all deals in transaction with common subordination versus TradFi would require subordination backing all the transaction assets. This is a big difference, significantly weakening the credit support of the proposed deal and would not be done in TradFi  All Maker vaults and assets collateralized within these vaults will have the 30% minimum subordination.  (5) Key Enforcement terms - the Proposal is very weak here. TradFi has cash custody with DACAs over all fund accounts, full first-priority UCCs on all entities, pledges of equity in any underlying SPVs holding collateral. The structure is really convoluted and the actual security package Maker is getting and is very indirect and difficult to legally enforce on. Key question is how much cooperation do they need from Blocktower or related parties to enforce if needed. Would a court see Maker as having a direct, enforceable interest or is some intermediary entity going to stand between?  This is not true. We have DACAs governing bank accounts and a SACA governing vaults. Maker will have a direct security interest. In addition, we have worked extensively with Christian and third-party counsel to ensure that these control agreements are enforceable by the trust agent.  (6) Proposal has most key functions performed by Blocktower. In TradFi most key functions not performed by borrower such as custody of the assets, verification agent, managing back-up servicers. Can Maker enforce on collateral/cash/bank accounts?  Yes, as mentioned above we have DACAs and SACAs. Furthermore, we have an independent, third-party loan verification, collateral, and paying agent who comes from TradFi that will be performing these key functions. They also have rights to take over in the unlikely event that we go bankrupt or no longer operate.  (7) Personal guarantees - none in proposal. In TradFi usually require personal guarantees for bad acts for small fund (particularly with 1st time managers)  BlockTower Credit is the credit franchise of BlockTower Capital, an SEC-registered digital asset and blockchain investment firm founded in 2017. The firm manages well over half a billion dollars. We are not a first-time investment advisor.  (8) Events of Default and Performance Triggers are weak in the Proposal. In TradFi EoDs and Performance Triggers typically have Minimum TNW: requiring $10mm+ of minimum tangible net worth in any fund borrower (if they are not cross collateralizing, this would apply to each transaction). There would also be excess spread ratios, cash collection ratios, leverage ratios which are not in the Proposal  This is also not factual. We accomplish the goal of an excess spread ratio through out interest coverage test. In addition leverage ratios are captured by our minimum subordination covenant.  (9) If deals are not cross collateralized (as in this Proposal) then the lender would have their own specific covenants with respect to the underlying portfolio collateral. They also underwrite to the lender\u2019s covenants and put language around not being able to modify or change those. If not cross collateralized, the bank is coming in as senior lender in an A/B structure: the bank has a lot of control of the deal and approval rights over any amendments etc.  We have strict underwriting criteria that must be met and an investment process and committee to manage. Furthermore, our 30% junior capital position is a strong incentives alignment mechanism in the sense that we will seek more protection to safeguard the facility and Maker benefits from these covenants and protections as the senior lender. As always, we appreciate the continued dialogue on our proposal. ",

                    "content": " Investment Assessment - Add Multiple Blocktower Credit Vault Types  TLDR:  I will be Voting against onboarding the Blocktower Credit Vaults, on the basis of this investment assessment which has been completed in a personal capacity as a MKR token holder. Based on the use of accepted financial evaluation principles, this deal is significantly underpriced. This valuation concludes that based on the pricing of similar and even less risky investments, this transaction is being subsidized by DAI holders to the tune of US$10+ million dollars in present value terms. The transaction generates no cash flow for MakerDAO until vault wind down or repayment that will only occur 48 months after drawdown. The transaction potentially leads to the overstatement of MakerDao\u2019s surplus buffer as accrued stability fees are recognized every second with actual payment deferred until the end of the 48 month availability period. This transaction adds unnecessary legal and technical risk to an already complex underlying transaction. Note that I do not question Blocktowers\u2019 ability to successfully deliver the underlying securitization program. Rejection of this investment is solely based on financial fundamentals of the proposed transaction from Maker\u2019s perspective, with the assumption that the maximum achievable rating would be equivalent to a public investment grade rating of AA+ (which given the risk assessments is optimistic).   Summarized below are the key reasons I will be voting against the onboarding of Blocktower Credit votes - including a high level financial evaluation spreadsheet used to reach the above conclusions here. NB: Readers should note that this assessment and my decision to vote against onboarding this collateral is made solely from the perspective of a MKR token holder and not as a CES contributor. If the resulting vote is to onboard this collateral, my personal opinion will not influence my commitment as a CES contributor to onboard transactions approved by MKR token holders. Also in no way should this be construed as investment advice  No Cash Flows/Real Income to Surplus Buffer From the term sheet for the transaction, the facility will essentially be available for drawdown during the initial availability period of 48 months, with final vault maturity of 60 months - which will allow the underlying collateral underpinning the DROP tokens to wind down with their repayment schedules up to the maturity date of 60 months. The total debt ceiling is available until the end of 48 months, subject to the final loan documentation conditions being met. The vault owner/(borrower) technically could drawdown up to the debt ceiling but intends to leave sufficient room in the debt ceiling for accrued stability fees - which accrue in the vault on a per-second basis. Based on the proposal, an indicative cash flow profile (assuming max drawdown and full payout within 60 months) is as follows:  blocktower-vaults-sf1024\u00d7768 9.42 KB  This profile shows that the maximum initial amount that can be drawn will be approx. US$123 mm leaving enough room within the debt ceiling to accrue stability fees over the term of the financing of approximately US$27 mm (Stability Fee = 4%):     Scenario: Blocktower Proposed t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5     MakerDao Net Cash Flow (123) - - - - 150             Notwithstanding that the underlying loans collateralized by DROP tokens may be revolving and may have combinations of interest and debt being paid. Based on the term sheet and how the Borrower has stated they will use this facility, the expected cash flow to MakerDAO,  is very similar to that of a Zero Coupon Bond - which makes the evaluation and assessment of this investment from the perspective of Maker relatively simple. The planned vault usage, has several implications concerning the Surplus Buffer and the stability fees charged, and actual \u201ccash flows\u201d received by Maker, namely, the following:   Maker receives no incremental cash flow during the vault availability and revolving period - which is not consistent with the Endgame intent to generate income for Maker so that Surplus Buffer funds can be used to generate collateral for the Protocol Owned Vault;   US$27 mm in aggregate accrued stability fees are effectively being recognized as income over the projected 60-month period the vaults will be available, notwithstanding that actual \u201crealization\u201d of that income can only be determined in the final year when the vault is scheduled to be closed (offsetting accounting entries to increase vault debt and credit the same amount to the vow);   Specifically, there is a risk of prematurely recognizing stability fee income to the surplus buffer and making POV investment decisions based on stability fees that may or may not ever be realized.  Facility Is Significantly Underpriced When Compared To Equivalent Investments With Significantly Lower Risk Fortunately, because of the cash flow profile of the proposed Blocktower transaction to MakerDao, it is relatively simple to assess this investment/blocktower vaults from a pricing perspective. From a financial evaluation perspective, all that is required is to find a proxy investment similar to the one proposed and compare the cost, pricing and risk profile of that investment to the one proposed by Blocktower utilizing the four vaults. In this case, there is public market data readily available for completing an evaluation. Specifically, a similar investment that would generate a similar cash flow profile to the proposed transaction is a zero coupon UST Government or Corporate bond with a term of 4-5 years. To assess the price and an appropriate yield for that investment, we can look at the imputed yield curve for UST zero coupon bonds issued by the US Treasury, which would provide a guideline for the potential stability fees to be charged to reflect that investment - such yields are available here. However, it is essential to keep in mind implicit in that assumption is that the Blocktower collateral has a similar risk profile to that of holding a UST government-issued zero coupon bond. Given the foregoing, the lack of secondary markets for the DROP token collateral, and the significant reliance on Blocktower, if rated, it is highly unlikely that this transaction would be worthy of an AA+ credit rating. Therefore, the base rate used as the investment proxy should be adjusted with an appropriate credit spread to reflect the risk of this investment. Conservatively, if we assume that this investment had the attributes of an Investment Grade UST public bond rating from a credit and risk perspective (it likely doesn\u2019t), this would provide a valid proxy/benchmark to assess the Blocktower Investment. To reflect investment grade pricing and the likely credit spread for an investment grade credit spread - information is available here. Given the forgoing based on current market data, a prudent assumption for pricing an acceptable alternative yield for the Blocktower proposal yields the following estimate:     Proxy Investment Yield Indicative Rate  Annual Equiv. Stability Fee** Data Source     UST 4 YEAR ZERO US GOVT COUPON YIELD 4.18%  Fitted Yield 4 Year UST Zero Coupon   PLUS: UST INVESTMENT GRADE SPREADS 1.45%  US Investment Grade Credit Spreads   UST PROXY INVESTMENT GRADE 4 YEAR ZERO 5.63% 5.71%     ** The indicative rate converted to an annual rate as per the stability fee Based on this methodology which financial professionals use to evaluate the price of a similar proxy investment, the blocktower proposal is significantly underpriced. Should you wish to assess different pricing assumptions, the spreadsheet which provides a high level analysis of this investment, is available here.      Investment Grade Proxy Blocktower Proposed Delta     Stability Fees 37 27 10   Max Vault Debt Available 113 123 (10)     Valuation Summary   Under the conservative assumption that an appropriate proxy for assessing the Blocktower investment is an investment grade zero coupon public bond. By pricing the Blocktower Proposal at the stated stability fee MakerDao would effectively be subsidizing this transaction for a minimum amount of US$10 million (in present value terms). This likely understates the subsidy provision. Given the illiquidity of the underlying collateral, it is possible, even with the Junior Capital provided, that this transaction would not be considered investment grade.   It should be noted that if Maker were to use widely accepted financial institution standards for accounting for investments. Then Maker would need to show this investment on our \u201ctrading book/balance sheet\u201d at the lower of cost or market. This means that, for this transaction, we would likely need to assume a minimum US$10 million loss in collateral value if the investment was required to be shown at the lower of cost or market (and the proxy investment is deemed as market).   Please note it may be the strategic intent of the proponents of this transaction to provide a significant subsidy to the Borrower. However, if that is the case, it would be much better to structure this as a strategic investment instead of Vault debt. Mainly as DAI Holders are indirectly bearing this large pricing subsidy    Technical and Legal Risks   This transaction appears to have been structured with the objective of facilitating the use of Centrifuge to generate DROP and TIN tokens creating significant additional legal complexity. However, this additional legal complexity is just layered over a traditional financial securitization transaction, creating additional legal risks concerning collateral management and enforcement. As there is no precedent for this type of legal structure, in the real world, prudent lenders would ensure adequate independent legal opinions regarding the enforcement of MakerDao\u2019s security and collateral have been provided. Given this and the added complication of the lender being a DAO, I believe the DAO is assuming unnecessary and significant legal risk without procuring independent legal opinions on transaction enforceability.   From a technical perspective - the use of Centrifuge in its current form, adds limited value, if any, to MakerDao, and in fact, likely creates an ongoing burden to the protocol in terms of maintenance and management of the underlying vault (see here). This is all the more evident in the context of the following factors:   The DROP tokens are only enforceable under the real-world documentation for this loan. They are not held in the MakerDao vault directly due to the complexity of procuring a complete token assessment of the Centrifuge protocol, as this would involve an assessment of i) Centrifuge on Polkadot, ii) the Centrifuge Bridge to Ethereum and iii) the TinLake smart contracts.   As per discussions and presentations from the borrower, the borrower has acknowledged that there is no secondary market in the DROP tokens, and there will be no other senior lenders lending to the Centrifuge pools issuing the DROP tokens. If liquidation is required, in discussions with Blocktower, it has been indicated that the most viable way of liquidating and ensuring the collateral value is not impaired is for Blocktower to allow for a natural wind-down of underlying loans within the vaults!     Technology risk would be eliminated, and legal risk would be significantly lower had this transaction been structured as a pure MIP21 transaction, especially when considering the added complexity that using Centrifuge adds to this transaction.    Other  As evidenced from the term sheet, there is a significant reliance on Blocktower for all aspects of the underlying collateral  - as originator, credit service provider, security and custody agent. While Blocktower would appear to have qualified staff in place to handle the underlying loan securitization program, the provided risk assessment does not allow any conclusions to be drawn as to whether the level of Junior Capital provided by Blocktower is adequate.   Conclusion   Some may question my skills to complete this assessment as I am generally associated with being an Engineer. However, I hold an MBA degree in Finance. In my previous banking career, investment valuation was a significant skill required for the numerous financings and financial advisory assignments I completed. This, high level analysis is based on real-world expertise I have gained from advising on, financing, and underwriting billions of dollars of real-world financings, including advisory mandates for debt restructuring and valuation of businesses across a wide range of industry domains.   From an investment perspective, MakerDao could generate the same if not higher returns with a significantly lower risk profile by completing a MIP21 investment in a 4-5 year UST Government Zero Coupon Bond without the incremental technology and legal risks being incurred in this transaction   Using accepted valuation principles and finding appropriate valuation proxies - Investment Grade UST Bonds - this analysis estimates that with the proposed pricing by Blocktower, Maker would be effectively providing a minimum subsidy to Blocktower of US$10 million dollars by accepting the proposed pricing of this vault.   There is no realized cash flow in this transaction until the Vaults wind down or are closed. Over the 5-year term until maturity, this could lead to a significant overstatement of the surplus buffer.   Even if priced differently, given the complex legal structure that is been put in place with the DAO,  to provide comfort with respect to legal risk I would recommend that independent legal opinions be procured with respect to the enforceability of the agreement with respect to realizing on the underlying collateral   In conclusion, with the proposed pricing, which is significantly below market rates for this credit and collateral risk, we are effectively subsidizing Blocktower to the tune of US$10+ million (at the expense of DAI holders) based on alternative comparitive investments. Given this, I will vote not to onboard the Blocktower credit vaults. ",

                    "content": "Hey @dbkcan - thank you for the thoughtful response here. Ultimately, I just want to address a few points here that are incorrect:  No Cash Flows/Real Income to Surplus Buffer  There is current cash flow and real income to the Surplus Buffer. Unlike HVB or MIP65, where principal is recognized in RWA-Urn and interest is separately recognized in RWA-Jar, the DROP token uses a PIK structure to accrue interest. This means that, on every regular payment back to Maker, the PIK\u2019d interest (which accrues every second) is actually recognized by Maker as a larger principal repayment. For example, if we were to borrow 100 DAI, we pay back 104.07 DAI in 1-year. If this were off-chain, 100 DAI would be paid back to RWA-Urn and 4.07 DAI would be paid back to RWA-Jar. Here, the equivalent is 104.07 is paid back directly to RWA-Urn, which increases the surplus buffer by an equivalent amount by burning 104.07 DAI for 100 DAI loaned, by Maker. It\u2019s merely an accounting difference. For proof, here are the relevant wallets for Maker/New Silver:   MCD_JOIN_RWA001_A, otherwise known as Maker\u2019s Wallet, is found at address: 0x476b81c12Dc71EDfad1F64B9E07CaA60F4b156E2   TinlakeManager, otherwise known as the DROP Wallet, is found at 0x2474F297214E5d96Ba4C81986A9F0e5C260f445D   I would also point to @SebVentures recent message in the MakerDAO Governance Discord: \" 1. btw @PaperImperium to your point that no one reimburse. Cumulatively (summing all cash send from NS to Maker) New silver reimbursed more than their max DC.  HTC and ConsolFreight have both reimbursed all their loans at some point\" This has been shared with you during our discussion with CES, but for more clarification to the Maker community: \u201cIn the case of RWA Vaults with Centrifuge, interest accrual is more akin to traditional tokenized assets (e.g. ETH-A) vaults. In this process, the Jug contract (Jug - Detailed Documentation - Maker Protocol Technical Docs) is accruing the stability fee on the vault and updating the debt in the Vat. The Vow does not hold any DAI (you can also see this on Etherscan: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa950524441892a31ebddf91d3ceefa04bf454466#code); instead it computes the surplus buffer internally. So basically the rate accumulation every second is actually indirectly increasing the surplus buffer.\u201d  Facility Is Significantly Underpriced When Compared To Equivalent Investments With Significantly Lower Risk I just want to make sure that people, including yourself, have looked at the rest of the risk assessment:     BlockTower Credit - Commercial and Legal Risk Assessment - Part II Domain Work   BlockTower Credit - Commercial and Legal Risk Assessment - Part II  BTCR - Originator/Sponsor Profile  Description  Profile: BTCR is an institutional investment manager under the umbrella of BlockTower Capital, an SEC-registered digital assets and blockchain investment firm. Founded in 2017 by Ari Paul (CIO) and Matthew Goetz (CEO), the firm manages over half a billion dollars. The firm is currently structured with four in-house strategies/teams: Flagship, Delta Neutral, Venture Capital, and no\u2026     I believe it addresses nearly every point that you\u2019ve made, though I do appreciate the time and thought you put into this post (particularly with respect to whether the level of Junior Capital is adequate). The 3 critical pieces that I would rehash here are the following:  We have made material adjustments in terms of the underlying assets - namely, 70/150 of the total debt ceiling will be backed by a pool of cross-collateralized, liquid, investment-grade ABS. We have been, and remain open to, increasing that number as a percentage of the total debt ceiling. For reference, these have been documented here:      BlockTower Credit - Onboarding Update Strategic Finance       Week Ending 9/16  In reinforcement of the Maker token holders overwhelming support for the Blocktower MIP-6 application, @christiancdpetersen and @teej will be evaluating the proposed structure and collateral. As such and to ensure transparency and accountability with the Maker community, we\u2019ll plan to jointly release weekly updates pertaining to deal progress. One important feature to highlight for the Maker community: Blocktower and ourselves intend to further develop the on-chain aspects of t\u2026      The market comp for this type of facility is not as you\u2019ve described; we have spent our professional careers investing in these types of assets and know that the facility available to us (if we were not missionaries about innovating for Maker to deploy into on-chain debt vs. deploying Maker\u2019s capital off-chain through trusts), would be at a 90% advance and 4% fixed cost of capital today (for a significantly longer period i.e. 10 years). To be clear, the counterparty would be Insurance capital.  For the other assets under consideration, the underlying assets are broadly the same (i.e. consumer loans in ABS). The only difference there is Maker does not lend against just the BBB part of the ABS stack; it lends against the entirety of the stack from AAA, AA, A, and BBB (the totality of the senior position). BlockTower Credit is also putting up its own capital in every junior position; we have some of the most sophisticated credit LPs in the world who have underwritten us as investment professional, our operational and due diligence processes, and we are not in the business of losing that junior, subordinate capital that sits beneath Maker\u2019s senior position.  Maker does take a direct security interest in the underlying collateral. We have even brought in an Indenture Trustee to enforce, as an independent third party, those interests in the event that BlockTower does not perform its obligations (i.e. for the benefit of Maker). Every protection that is standard in a traditional securitization, from Deposit Account Control Agreements to Security Account Control Agreements that grant TACO. This is mentioned by @christiancdpetersen in his assessment above (who, by the way, is an unbelievable asset to the Maker community given his Maker experience and subject matter knowledge). In this event, even if the DROP tokens are illiquid (the senior liability of the Issuer SPV), the underlying assets are not (particularly with respect to IG ABS or commoditized whole loan products). Those cash flows, which Maker has a recognized claim over via the DACA or SACA, belong to the DROP holder i.e. Maker, and Maker\u2019s position would be paid down with the proceeds of that sale.  Personal notes: But with respect to your post and points, almost all of this has been covered in the risk and legal assessment or in direct conversations between our team and yours, or you personally. This post is, at best, a reflection of not having read the materials provided or, at worst, a refusal to listen or engage with us in good faith. If it\u2019s the former, then you know that we are available at your request to continue the dialogue and work with you to drive Maker\u2019s efforts forward. Working with Maker on structuring this transaction has been a huge learning experience. There are many things that we could have done better, especially with respect to you and CES, specifically. Perhaps the animosity is because we are not Maker insiders, just outsiders who were learning the process as we went. For that, I do apologize - provided the community chooses to proceed with our proposal, we intend on mending any errors and working closely with you, @zmtong, and the rest of CES as partners to further Maker\u2019s position as a  leader in our ecosystem.

Unlike HVB or MIP65, where principal is recognized in RWA-Urn and interest is separately recognized in RWA-Jar, the DROP token uses a PIK structure to accrue interest. This means that, on every regular payment back to Maker, the PIK\u2019d interest (which accrues every second) is actually recognized by Maker as a larger principal repayment.    As indicated this analysis looks at the cash flow profile solely from a Maker perspective. So it is completely invisible to Maker - whether that debt repayment was comprised solely of interest or blended payments - it doesn\u2019t matter - the point is that in the absence of a declining debt ceiling (declining in the amount of Maker Vault stability fees - that are being accounted for) - that debt repayment made in the vault can be re-borrowed at any time (subject to the loan covenants governing the underlying issuance of DROP and TIN tokens) - up to the debt ceiling.  The effect of this is that any stability fee accounted for in the Surplus Buffer is being reinvested in the collateral and has that risk with respect to future repayment - which leads essentially to the Accrual of Stability Fees I have presented in my analysis. So I would disagree that I am incorrect on this The cash flow profile reflects what is possible for the vault owners - given the parameters for the vaults. Whilst in reality you may have periods where the underlying securitization program is not fully drawn and you may choose to repay vault debt until there is new demand for issuance of DROP tokens. Based on the vault parameters and assuming full utilization of the underlying securitization, Blocktower/Centrifuge could redraw up to the debt ceiling at any time during the \u201cavailability period\u201d and that is what is reflected in the cash flow profile      humancapitol:  \"instead it computes the surplus buffer internally. So basically the rate accumulation every second is actually indirectly increasing the surplus buffer.\u201d    Yes but the offsetting entry to this - which you have not highlighted - is that the amount of vault debt is increased by the same amount - which is probably fine for crypto-native assets with automated liquidations and reliable secondary markets as there is a very high probability that this will be repaid. For non-crypto native assets, however, the realization of the stability fee booked to the surplus buffer is now dependent on the \u201coffsetting\u201d entry, ie the corresponding increase in vault debt being realized, which based on the structure of this transaction will not be know until wind down of the DROP tokens at the end of the availability period.      humancapitol:  The market comp for this type of facility is not as you\u2019ve described;   If by the \u201cfacility\u201d you mean the underlying securitization program, true - but again I am only evaluating this from the Maker Vault perspective. And for the cash flow profile that Maker sees under the assumption of full utilization - the cash profile is very much like a zero coupon bond. And rather than get into a debate about what the risk profile of the underlying securitization program is AA+ or investment grade US corporate debt - we can reproduce this cash flow profile by an investment in a UST government treasury with an equivalent term to the availability period. The conclusion is that by investing in this type of instrument - we can receive the same cash flows as we would with these vaults - but with a significantly lower risk profile (US Govt Risk) with a similar return to what Blocktower has proposed. From this it is easy to conclude which is a better investment. Building on that I have extrapolated what return we would have, if the underlying risk profile (ie. the securitization program) was similar to a corporate UST investment grade issuer and this indicates that in NPV terms that Maker would is underwater to the extent of US$10+ million obviously this is an estimate. We can debate what credit rating you could potentially get for the underlying securitization program and maybe it would be better than the average investment grade spread I have used in my spreadsheet. The point though is that the underlying securitization program will not be rated, that there is no underlying secondary market in the DROP tokens and there isn\u2019t enough detail in the risk assessment that was completed to debate or determine a proxy risk rating.  However, you have access to the spreadsheet and can adjust the rates if you feel a different proxy should be used.     humancapitol:  This post is, at best, a reflection of not having read the materials provided or, at worst, a refusal to listen or engage with us in good faith.   I read all the materials and this is not about bad faith. My role in the DAO is as a contributor for the CES core unit - and our mandate is to complete technical assessments and implementations of transactions presented to the community. CES is not mandated nor am I, by Governance Token holders to structure and or negotiate deals on behalf of the DAO. If anything structuring and pricing advice should have been available from @strat-fin-core-unit, who has the mandate for working on the origination side of RWAs. So it is unfortunate that you perceive the restrictions on our mandate, from token holders, as an intent not to act in good faith. Notwithstanding, I did highlight many of these concerns in discussions with Christian and others - specifically with respect to the stability fees and as you have modelled this partially on the HVB structure you would hopefully have seen that a RWAJar was used in that transaction to ensure that Maker was realizing income on an ongoing basis. Again I reiterate that this assessment has solely been completed from the perspective of being a Maker token holder. From that perspective I want to ensure that the safety and security of the protocol are protected and that we are receiving adequate returns for investments that are made. Notwithstanding my personal opinion - you have my assurance that this will not interfere with my professional obligations as a CES core contributor. ",

In my experience, we\u2019re not going to make it in this ecosystem if we can\u2019t handle some objective, well-reasoned pushback and discourse in the forums. At risk of exposing myself as an absolute moron to the community, I think I am missing something w/ respect to the revolving vs. current interest paid argument. If Maker lends us 100 DAI and we owe 104 DAI in 1 year, Maker did not \u201clend\u201d 4 additional DAI throughout the year. We\u2019ve been charged interest but only ever \u201cborrowed\u201d 100 DAI in principal. When we go to pay this back, we burn 104 DAI against the 100 we borrowed, which decreases the total amount of DAI outstanding by 4 extra DAI than what Maker has lent out; this difference, in the form of the PIK on DAI, increases the net equity of Maker (i.e. my assumption of what the Surplus Buffer represents, although I\u2019ve seen even Maker insiders argue with each other over the academic definition of it) by 4 DAI. That shouldn\u2019t change just because it\u2019s a revolver. I do want to hear you out on the \u201cfrom the vault\u201d perspective, however - it\u2019s possible that I\u2019m missing some aspect of your perspective from Maker, and I think there are some things I can clear up w/ respect to Tinlake. And, of course, would love to hear any suggestions here. I hear you on the debate with respect to yields. To that, I can only leave it to the Maker community whether or not the deal, with the concessions that we\u2019ve made, and the partnership with BlockTower Credit is worth it. I would also seriously push back that the deal is off-market; this is structured to be 4% net to Maker, not treasury yields * (1-tax rate). Considering the additional costs and risks associated with this transaction, I am confident that these apples-to-apples comparisons will be difficult to truly quantify. Let me know if we can take you up on that offer to chat! Best, Kevin ",

Regarding the cash-flows, how you\u2019d like to account for the realized cash flow is well stated at this point, but it bears repeating that this is true of any crypto vault that Maker operates. There is nothing unique to this collateral type versus crypto collateral from a cash flow perspective. While crypto collateral exists within liquid markets, making the risk of loss quite different than that of illiquid RWA collateral, the accounting of the cash is not different. Blocktower being an identified and known counterparty, contractually obligated to make monthly payments, and the nature of the underlying collateral are other factors that can be considered to influence the cash flow, but I think these are better expressed as risk factors. The analogy of a US treasury investment over an equivalent term is useful, but I would disagree vehmently with equating this to a zero coupon bond. Regardless of who\u2019s perspective you take, there is no practical reality in which monthly payments based on an accrued debt position can be considered \u201czero coupon\u201d. I think we\u2019re going to end up disagreeing here, but I think this is an accounting issue at its core. Regarding Maker investing in treasuries versus private credit\u2026this is already happening. Maker has quite a bit of it\u2019s balance sheet being deployed into treasuries already, with more to be allocated in the future. This deal adds diversity, new relationships, and entirely new structural foundations to Maker\u2019s balance sheet. Comparing this deal against treasuries in a vaccum doesnt seem very useful. It is more useful to see how this deal adds to Maker\u2019s overall balance sheet and aids with it\u2019s future objectives. Much more of an ALM discussion than whether this should compare to treasuries or not. In regards to non-finanial risks and opportunities to meet Maker\u2019s objectives, I\u2019m dissapointed you don\u2019t see more merit in this deal. Given you\u2019re engineering and finance background I would have thought the opportunity in on-chain RWA collateral would resonate more. Since it hasn\u2019t, I\u2019ll share some of my perspectives, and invite @elidco and @spin to share theirs.   Tokenized collateral provides Maker a direct ownership claim. The ability for Maker, through governance or as represented by a trustee, to actually claim ownership of collateral in a Maker native format is powerful. \u201cPosession is 9/10ths of the law\u201d as its oft stated, and Maker\u2019s possession is quite clear here. Compared to a more traditional off-chain deals, the nature of custodial risk is reduced (no other party but Maker \u201cowns\u201d the collateral), the legal vector of attack is diminished (KYC occurs once upon establishment of the structure, there is no acount held on behalf of Maker that can be revoked or retroactively subject to KYC, and Maker\u2019s collateral claims aren\u2019t subject to opaque business entity structures), and, finally, on-chain ownership provides the foundation for any and all future RWA developments.  The on-chain securitization structures eliminates interemediary reliance. The cash-flows, the securitized portfolio, and the collateral asset registry itself is all captured on-chain. This not only reduces operational costs and overhead, but it provides for improved gurantees in the actual execution of the deal. While errors and bugs are still very much relevant in smart contracts, the efficiencies and reduced reliance on third-party paper-pushers more than makes up for this.  On-chain infrastructure, counterparties, and relationships are an investment in the ecosystem of the future. Deals like this continue to build the infrastructure and counterparties necessary for the development of an on-chain asset ecosystem. Maker\u2019s objectives should always be to protect the protocol and support the activities necessary for growth, but there are objectives to pursue. With enough of the balance sheet invested in liquid and public debt, the continued first-class development and engagment with crypto markets, then the next place for Maker to focus on is in future-proofing it\u2019s ecosystem. As the world comes on-chain, it behoves Maker to continue leading from the front rather than following. A deal of this size is, incredibly tiny compared to Maker\u2019s larger balance sheet, provides the leading position and access to the exponential-level growth trend of a tokenized world. Maybe to put it more simply, an on-chain secondary market for RWA collateral will never become available to Maker without investment in the foundations of that capability. Other stablecoins are already building towards this, and Maker should not relinquish this lead.  All in all, I think this is actually incredible discussion. The loss of the RWF Core Unit has left the DAO without dedicated and long-term real world finance perspective to nurture within the community. This type of conversation is sorely needed and I\u2019m glad it\u2019s in long-form format on the forum. The nuance and complexity of the topic necessitates some time and effort, so I appreciate @dbkcan and @humancapitol for engaging with it so seriously. @CodeKnight already pointed out how useful it is, and I am sure other delegates feel similarly.

                    "content": "    Khan:  There is nothing unique to this collateral type versus crypto collateral from a cash flow perspective. While crypto collateral exists within liquid markets, making the risk of loss quite different than that of illiquid RWA collateral, the accounting of the cash is not different.   100% agree with this - and this is the crux of the issue - stability fees are accruing to the surplus buffer and being recognized as income -at the same time the vault debt is increasing by the same amount. This is ok for crypto collateral where vault liquidation is automated and likely recoverable as DAI, within hours and without loss - but entirely inappropriate for illiquid RWAs.  Yes MakerDao risk is with Blocktower and the Vault is equivalent to a term loan with a 1 year/bullet repayment - as stated in the term sheet the vaults will be managed to facilitate the accrual of stability fees/ The main concern being is it appropriate for the surplus buffer to be backed by vault collateral comprised of essentially illiquid RWA assets - I would suggest not ideal - if it is going to be a lengthy and costly process to liquidate the underlying collateral.     Khan:  I think we\u2019re going to end up disagreeing here, but I think this is an accounting issue at its core.   Unfortunately yes,  I would suggest a finance/valuation issue at its core based on principles of valuation accounting for the surplus buffer needs to be carefully assessed     Khan:  Comparing this deal against treasuries in a vacuum doesn\u2019t seem very useful. It is more useful to see how this deal adds to Maker\u2019s overall balance sheet and aids with it\u2019s future objectives. Much more of an ALM discussion than whether this should compare to treasuries or not.   Again - I am purely looking that as a capital allocation issue - obviously the question needs to be asked whether Dai holders are benefiting more when MakerDao allocates scarce engineering/governance resources to the ongoing onboarding and management of this investment vis a vis an alternative investment - and given this do the risk return parameters make sense. I acknowledge that if there may be strategic growth reasons for making an investment - but think the risk return profile of this has to make sense .     Khan:  In regards to non-financial risks and opportunities to meet Maker\u2019s objectives, I\u2019m disappointed you don\u2019t see more merit in this deal. Given you\u2019re engineering and finance background I would have thought the opportunity in on-chain RWA collateral would resonate more.   Khan - I understand many of your comments here - but there are really 2 distinct perspectives - Centrifuge vs MakerDao. Obviously, my perspective is different than yours and I have an internal core unit view of what is involved in onboarding collateral. It is not as easy as flipping a switch and there are many core units involved in the onboarding process - governance, strategic finance, growth, oracles, pe, techops etc - significant time and resources are spent onboarding each RWA and Maker is currently deficient in collateral monitoring and management. But having been involved in this deal - my perceptions is that this deal is a traditional finance deal under which we have added additional layers of legal and technical complexity, where from Maker\u2019s perspective any liquidation is manual and based on real world agreements. This may make sense if Blocktower/Centrifuge were going to develop/support secondary markets in the underlying tokens - but that doesn\u2019t currently appear to be the case, but hopefully will be something that is prioritized. I do see the merits of on-chain collateral but again for this particular transaction - I just see a repeat of the previous MIP21 transactions - which are not scalable (see here)[Collateral On-Boarding and Management of RWAs - Lessons Learned/Recommendations] and whilst Centrifuge may benefit from being able to double its TVL - I don\u2019t really see the benefits to Maker unless there is a concerted effort to develop secondary markets in the drop tokens of this pool.     Khan:  All in all, I think this is actually incredible discussion. The loss of the RWF Core Unit has left the DAO   Agreed. and looking forward to continuing the discussion. ",

                    "content": " BlockTower Credit - Commercial and Legal Risk Assessment - Part II  BTCR - Originator/Sponsor Profile  Description  Profile: BTCR is an institutional investment manager under the umbrella of BlockTower Capital, an SEC-registered digital assets and blockchain investment firm. Founded in 2017 by Ari Paul (CIO) and Matthew Goetz (CEO), the firm manages over half a billion dollars. The firm is currently structured with four in-house strategies/teams: Flagship, Delta Neutral, Venture Capital, and now Credit. As of 10/13, BlockTower officially announced its $150MM venture fund. Essence: Starting in 2017 with its Flagship fund, BlockTower has progressively integrated new businesses as its investment principals have observed market opportunities arise. In this vein, Delta-Neutral launched in 2018, Venture launched in 2020, and Credit launched in 2022. BlockTower sees a long-term opportunity to marry professional credit underwriting expertise with DeFi Capital. As such, the firm has built the operations and onboarded the personnel required to bring structured credit rigor to crypto. BlockTower has surveyed the credit landscape and set its sights somewhere in between public securitizations and direct trade finance lending (factoring). As such, the originators that BlockTower will lend to directly or buy the assets of A) tend to be too mature/established for venture debt but B) not so established as to be able to tap securitization markets. It will gear its portfolio to be short term (6 months - 3 years) and include exposures to end assets like receivables, invoices, inventory etc. Illustrative portfolio collateral might be residential construction receivables or Gig economy microloans. We can think about BlockTower as a lender to small lenders, meant to transform what is currently a strong business into a stronger business that is institutionally bankable. BlockTower will also direct about half of its borrowing capacity toward structured credit product, or asset-backed securities, the market for which has recently turned accretive relative to direct origination. Motivation: From speaking with Ari, BlockTower has identified an opportunity to drive efficiencies to the asset transformation process. That is, the process of pulling risk from the real world and packaging/distributing/accounting for it in a more efficient way. Whereas underwriting and servicing are off-chain processes that are generally difficult to affect by integrating with crypto, asset performance tracking, distribution, and liquidity stand to be enhanced. By using Centrifuge, a long-time Maker partner, BlockTower can aggregate disparate assets (yield profiles) and securitize them efficiently and transparently. As the senior lender of first resort for on-chain RWAs, Maker\u2019s affordable cost of capital and flexible balance sheet is the most obvious fit for a natively on-chain financing structure. Though Maker\u2019s cost of capital and structural advantages are surely beneficial to BlockTower in this single instance, BlockTower has a strategic, long-term interest in seeing DeFi X RWA work. Not only is BlockTower the first successfully greenlit originator to have an already established crypto operation, but it also retains 11,950 MKR tokens and 2-3% of the CFG network (with options to increase stake to 5-6%). As such, there exists a natural alignment of long-term interests.  Team  Kevin Miao: Kevin Miao is Head of Credit at BlockTower Capital, with primary portfolio management responsibilities for BlockTower Credit. From 2014 through the beginning of 2021, Kevin worked at Citigroup, most recently as a vice president in the structured credit trading division. Kevin led a trading desk that primarily covered (i) non-mortgage asset backed securities and whole loans ranging from conventional (e.g., automobiles, credit card receives, student loans) to esoteric (e.g., railcar, whole business, marketplace lending); (ii) legacy ABS CDOs, SIVs, and RMBS CDS; and (iii) commercial real estate CLOs, managing a ~$2bn combined book across all asset classes. Following his time at Citigroup, Kevin became Director of Operations at Capchase, a Series A fintech company that lends to SaaS and other recurring revenue companies. At Capchase, Kevin was primarily responsible for the development, refinement, and automation of the core underwriting and risk management processes. In addition, Kevin supported capital markets efforts including credit facility negotiations and transaction reporting. Kevin earned a B.A. in economics with a minor in mathematics from Bowdoin College. More recently, Kevin was pursuing his M.B.A. at Harvard Business School until withdrawing to lead BlockTower Credit. Jack Carlisle: Jack Carlisle is Director of Credit at BlockTower Capital. From 2016 through the beginning of 2022, Jack worked at Hildene Capital Management, most recently as a Senior Investment Analyst. At Hildene, Jack covered primary and secondary trading for the firm\u2019s positions in asset backed securities, legacy collateralized debt obligations, and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. In addition to trading functions, Jack led the firm\u2019s sourcing initiatives for non-bank lending products, facilitating forward flow agreements with non-qualified mortgage, residential transition lending, and marketplace lending originators. Jack earned a B.A. in philosophy and history (magna cum laude) from Colgate University. Kevin Chan and Anant Matai, the 3rd and 4th members of the BlockTower Credit team, compliment investing efforts via deep technical expertise, which is key to BT as it seeks to modernize operations/reporting, departing from a personnel-heavy model toward an API-first infrastructure. Anant comes from a more traditional structure credit background, running and coding ops workflows for Axonic, a hedge fund, while Kevin comes from a more crypto-native background, where he created blockchain-oriented MVPs for large financial institutions as a management consultant/Solidity developer Personnel Scaling, Operations, and Infrastructure Today, there are 4 FTEs (Kevin Miao, Jack Carlisle, Kevin Chan, and Anant Matai) on the BlockTower Credit Investment team. BlockTower Credit taps into the BlockTower Platform (which has 27 FTEs across 3 other funds), primarily interfacing with its 4-person operations team, 4-person marketing team, internal legal + compliance teams, as well as its constellation of external counsel providers (primarily Reed Smith, Sidley Austin, Loewenstein, etc.). BlockTower Credit would next look to bring on someone with an asset-backed securities (ABS) background to enhance underwriting efforts and manage the due diligence load. Soon after it\u2019ll push to onboard either more ops talent or a credit expert focused entirely on sourcing strong deals from alternative channels. BlockTower is building internal monitoring systems (as any credit businesses would) at facility and asset levels. Performance data is gauged daily and will be rolled up to monthly surveillance reports to be posted in the Maker forums/permaweb. BlockTower\u2019s capital deployment toward any given deal is contingent upon receipt of a Borrowing Base Certificate, which is audited and re-underwritten at the time of draw. Since assembling the team in early 2022, BlockTower has scrutinized all core RWA protocols and platforms, seeking suitable environments to potentially deploy equity and/or serve as pool operators/asset managers. After lending through TrueFi and running pools on both Maple and Clearpool, BlockTower elected to integrate with Centrifuge most directly. That such an intensive process ended in such a specific implementation serves as a testament to Centrifuge\u2019s quality.  Credit Policy and Investment Process   Investment Process  BlockTower\u2019s investment process consists of four stages. As it moves through them, the focus changes from broad and top-down to focused and bottom-up.   Sector Analysis to identify attractive investment opportunities, including broad analysis of the expected performance, liquidity, and correlation of the assets and originators to macroeconomic factors, including interest rates, unemployment, sector specific trends, and other economic indicators.   Sourcing & Origination to generate a robust top-of-funnel deal flow through our ecosystem of partnerships and unique position as leading a digital asset investment firm partnering with tech-enabled originators. These partnerships are augmented by BlockTower\u2019s broad relationships across both traditional and digital finance, community activity, media presence, and systematic outbound strategy, targeting originators generating assets with attractive risk and reward characteristics.   Underwriting & Due Diligence to accurately project loan unit economics, expected performance, recovery value of the underlying secured asset (if applicable), financial position and viability of the originator itself, and other factors to analyze various stressed scenarios and price risk. This includes meetings with management, engaging third party experts for valuation and compliance reviews, background checks, which ultimately result in the negotiation and execution of a term sheet.   Structuring, Executing & Monitoring to create appropriate legal documentation, perfect security of our collateral interest, institute meaningful financial and eligibility covenants, establish exclusivity terms, and identify backup servicing solutions and other service providers to manage distressed situations and maximize recovery. Once a transaction is consummated, covenant testing and collateral performance is monitored on an ongoing basis, with proactive management to arrest funding at the earliest stages of distress.   BlockTower\u2019s credit portfolio is managed so as to limit concentration in any one originator or asset, pushing for diversification and compression of volatility in loss-adjusted returns. All deals are proposed to the BlockTower investment Committee, which incorporates judgment from internal and external legal counsel, compliance, operations, and financial divisions in coming to a verdict on whether to pursue. BlockTower\u2019s Credit mandate is geared towards principal preservation which it targets via three strategic focuses: A) Downside Protection B) Aligned Interests C) Portfolio Management.  Downside Protection: Lender protections like ring-fencing true sale assets via bankruptcy remote SPVs, cash lock-boxes, and rigorous legal/regulatory reviews. Structural enhancements such as backup servicers, springing cash traps, and conditional acceleration. Underwrite diversification across sectors, asset exposures, and borrowers, reducing binary/lumpy credit outcomes. Aligned Interests: Originating partner (end-borrower) required to pledge first-loss capital, incentivizing strong origination and maximization of recoveries. Rather than a full up-front commitment, facilities scale up with the performance of the originators. On a case by case basis, BlockTower will retain equity warrants in the originator, sharing in the future successes and difficulties of the borrower\u2019s business. Portfolio Management: tech-enabled and granular asset performance monitoring. Manual verification of borrower activities via frequent communication and on-site inspections. Dynamic management of concentration matrices: single-borrower, single-asset, geography, and sectors.   Risk and Asset Management  BlockTower\u2019s business, underwriting smaller (5-40MM) asset-backed opportunities, is manually intensive and doesn\u2019t really scale easily. Wouldn\u2019t the operational overhead and complexity inherent to sourcing, origination, underwriting, surveillance, servicing, asset management, and workouts, prove a burden and risk to the ongoing success of the going concern? BlockTower leverages its large ops team outside of the core BlockTower Credit team. Furthermore, BlockTower will integrate platforms such as Peach, Finley, Percent, and others to automate and outsource borrowing base management functions. With that said, the nature of BlockTower\u2019s business is such that it does require specialized, human oversight to balance the quantitative imperatives with qualitative \u2018gut\u2019 judgment. This sort of intuition is homed by seeing lots of different asset classes, default situations, macroeconomic environments, and borrower behaviors, hence why BT has filled itself out with ops and credit people with experience. Does BlockTower gear its portfolio with regard to cyclical/non-cyclical portfolio exposures? Ceteris paribus, is the investment team just as comfortable originating facilities against residential construction invoices (cyclical) as it is against packaging materials invoices (non-cyclical)? BlockTower is comfortable with both categories and will tailor the cost of capital and advance rate accordingly as per any cyclicality/discretionary risk. In the case that a business is subject to high cyclicality, the underwriting bar is higher (e.g. BlockTower will require a longer history of performance). How does BTCR manage deterioration of credit within the portfolio? BTCR controls for deterioration of credit by structuring its exposures ex-ante and managing its exposures ex-post. Ex-ante: In order to minimize the odds that performance erodes, BlockTower diligences individual deals for a variety of structural characteristics, including adequate track record, strong principals/team, cash at the corporate level, resilient thesis, excess spread, automation of servicing apparatus, etc. Furthermore, BlockTower will construct its portfolio in such a way that no one exposure, borrower, or industry will disproportionately affect the portfolio, and thus Maker\u2019s exposure, negatively. The portfolio is structured toward certain collective characteristics, such as maintaining a sufficient debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and originator risk retention (credit enhancement). Ex-post: LTV Step Down: Because BTCR holds the view that there exists a directional correlation between slower projects and probability of default, it haircuts receivables based on a few different triggers:  Time Outstanding: As receivables age past certain key benchmarks set by BTCR prior to the origination of a credit, say 120 days, it will apply a haircut to the borrowing base. If a receivable ages to 130 days, for example, it will haircut a receivable\u2019s value in the borrowing base by 10%. Then, if the receivable hits 180 days, by 25%. Borrowing base haircuts as per the aforementioned methodology precede advance rate, which embeds further conservatism. Excess Spread: If the difference between the rate BTCR\u2019s borrowers earn on their assets (interest revenue) and the rate they owe on their BTCR facility (debt service cost) drops below a predetermined amount, BTCR will also haircut the borrowing base, effectively dropping the LTV. Default  The above triggers represent, to varying degrees, an erosion of BTCR\u2019s recovery odds. As such, each scenario is addressed via some conditional, structural improvement to the facility\u2014typically by demanding borrowers post more money. Milestone-Based Funding: BTCR embeds key events like successful equity raises into funding upsizes. As the borrower de-risks by successfully achieving key milestones, BTCR will ratchet up its exposure accordingly. Stop Funding Events: For certain originators, there will exist \u201cstop-funding\u201d events. Such scenarios are more severe than \u201cLTV Step Down\u201d events but less severe than \u201cAcceleration\u201d events. In these scenarios, BTCR will conditionally freeze new draws on the facility and disallow originations. However, it will not demand immediate repayment on outstanding debt. Acceleration: In the case that BTCR gauges a borrower to be in deep distress, it will accelerate its facility/the borrower\u2019s indebtedness, or demand immediate repayment on outstanding debt. In trade finance, a key asset class within the eventual BTCR credit portfolio, fraud risk is a dangerous, binary risk. How does BlockTower mitigate fraud? Asset originators provide representations\u2014in the case they originate fraudulent loans, they\u2019re obligated to repurchase the loans from BTCR. Regardless of this failsafe, BTCR\u2019s due diligence process analyzes an originator\u2019s KYC/AML process, fraud detection, and credit decisioning apparatus and underwrites a fraud rate above the historical average for the originator. Finally, originators have both a short-term and long-term incentive to minimize fraud. Due to the significant first-loss position retained in assets, each originator bears credit risk. More importantly, because an originator\u2019s credit and equity providers track its fraud rate, failing to monitor fraud rigorously would be existential for business continuity. BTCR is originating assets that are too immature to be securitized, whether because the loans are non-fungible/heterogeneous or the originators are yet to generate a sufficient track record/volume of originations. As such, the assets are messier and require more direct maintenance. Typically, under this umbrella would fall assets that are more illiquid than their securitized counterparts but originated via borrowers who benefit from great excess spread. I.e. The economics of the business are strong vis a vis the debt service incurred on a per exposure basis. These are hairier, less established businesses which tend not to benefit from strong servicing infrastructure. As such, when originating these credits, BTCR leans heavily on the originator to service the assets. Given the very hands-on nature of the borrower\u2019s originations and thus their servicing infrastructure (e.g. phone calls, direct relationships etc.), wouldn\u2019t BTCR rely heavily on the originator to service the assets? This presents a risk: how heavily is BTCR\u2019s ability to drive returns/recoveries tied to the existence and health of the originator themselves? If the originator disappears, how does the maintenance/servicing of the underlying receivables/credits get picked up? BTCR manages this overreliance on the originator\u2019s servicing capacity in two ways.   Require that the originator maintain, at the corporate level, a certain amount of cash to maintain servicing infrastructure should the corporate entity die. This is akin to any other performance trigger but unlike something like a Debt Service Coverage Ratio, which is measured and mediated at the SPV or asset level, this covenant is applied to the originator themselves. This cash reserve can be thought of as a servicing life-line reserve. Typically this reserve consists of three months of runway.   In the case that this trigger is tripped (i.e. reserve is not sufficient), BT will halt funding new originations and proceed with winding down existing ones until the reserve is topped up appropriately.   Progressively push the originator towards a replicable, automated servicing solution. Many of these originators manage servicing manually through an ad-hoc patchwork of internal employees who pick up the phone and track down borrowers/ensure payments. The issue that arises here is in the case that the originator shuts down and BT has to step in and take over the servicing of its portfolio. Obviously, if the servicing solution is already self-sustaining and automated, the transition will be less abrupt. I.e. an automated servicing infrastructure, all else equal, de-risks the exposure by hedging the risk, to some extent, of the originator disappearing/stopping servicing its portfolio    Financial Position  How much cash/equity does the firm have on hand? Debt? Gearing. Performance of the various funds? Performance relative to the index/peer group of managers? How much money have you raised from LPs? Over what period was that number raised? Though BlockTower is unable to disclose how much capital it has raised from LPs, the raised amount (over ~9 months) is sufficient to cover the necessary TIN threshold ($64MM) plus a moderate buffer. BlockTower has raised LP capital from clean energy funds, public pension funds, institutional asset managers, venture capital and private equity firms, insurance companies, and family offices.  Work-Out and Recovery Experience  In 2008-2012, many securitized assets, starting with Real Estate bonds and spreading into ABS bonds, suffered severe losses. When interests and principal shortfalls hit, impaired bonds are controlled by the junior most (first-loss) holders, or those who own \u201cB-piece\u201d. While at Citi during the years 2014-2020, Kevin drove the purchase of controlling tranches of impaired ABS CDO tranches. He liaised with the securitization parties to prompt the SPV\u2019s (entity that held underlying assets and issued debt obligations) collapse and managed the unwind and liquidation of the underlying short-term credit assets at a profit. As part of a separate strategy, Kevin executed the purchase of $2.5B of credit default swaps on underlying residential mortgage backed securities (CDS RMBS: protections on the erosion of residential real estate mortgages, i.e. if mortgages default, CDS holder profits) from a competitor\u2019s bad debt book and unwound 20% against Citi\u2019s previously acquired CDO portfolio for a >$300MM profit.  Asset Mix - Description & Overview   Pipeline   1280\u00d7573 137 KB   BlockTower Portfolio Composition & Pipeline Review  BlockTower\u2019s portfolio will consist of two broad asset archetypes:    Bespoke asset types, scaling originator unit economics     Commoditized asset types, emergent lender      983\u00d7728 105 KB   Novel asset types, strong originator unit economics This bucket consists of novel lending solutions (novel assets) but with strong borrowers/originators who benefit from great unit economics. Assets like credit card receivables or traditional ABS auto loans are commoditized/well-trafficked and thus would not apply here. Creative lending solutions for financing residential construction or the import/export of used vehicles might apply. Typically, under this umbrella would fall assets that are more illiquid than their securitized counterparts but originated via borrowers who benefit from great excess spread. I.e. The economics of the business are strong vis a vis the debt service incurred on a per exposure basis. These are hairier, less established businesses which tend not to benefit from strong servicing infrastructure. As such, when originating these credits, BlockTower leans heavily on the originator to service the assets. This presents a risk: how heavily is BT\u2019s ability to drive returns/recoveries tied to the existence and health of the originator themselves? If the originator disappears, how does the maintenance/servicing of the underlying receivables/credits get picked up? Pipeline Review: Case Study - Project Elevator (Not the borrower\u2019s real name) Elevator is a working capital management platform that intermediates homeowners and general contractors and brings capital efficiency and predictability to the residential construction process. Both up-front and as a contractor completes improvements on the home, Elevator will pay them early and purchase the accounts receivable, removing uncertainty for the contractor, and taking credit risk to the homeowner. Value-Add for Contractors:  More guaranteed cashflow up-front to cover OpEx or other projects Predictable payments for work completed Easy invoicing and operations processes  Value-Add for Borrowers:  Lower up-front cost for home renovation projects Faster turnaround Ability to secure and attract higher-quality contractors Easy reporting, progress, and payment experience  Selection of Terms & Conditions:  Scale: $5MM funding, $15MM in funding accessible upon hitting performance hurdles. Potential to scale to $50MM. Performance Hurdle: Series A Financing in excess of $5MM and no active event of default Advance Rate: 85% up to $15MM of utilization, 90% thereafter. Financial Covenant: Elevator required to hold on corporate balance sheet the greater of 3 months runway and 7.5% of drawn facility tranche in unencumbered cash Stock Warrant Coverage: 2% warrant coverage  Investment Opportunity: Elevator has outgrown its existing $2.5MM facility and is seeking to refinance it with a $10MM accordion facility to enable the origination of new construction receivables. BlockTower will consider opening a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility to Elevator with a 3-year term, drawable against eligible collateral. Commoditized asset types, emergent lender This bucket consists of a more commoditized product/asset but originated by an earlier-stage lender with less favorable unit economics. Traditional and well-trafficked assets like auto loans and credit card receivables would apply. Because the originators have neither a long track record nor strong reputation in the marketplace, these borrowers are unable to access securitization execution for their assets. Because these sorts of assets are well understood and have been around for a long time, the bench of servicing providers is deep. This means that BT is less exposed to the aforementioned risk scenario where an originator is overly involved in servicing and proceeds to disappear. Third-party infrastructure providers are utilized when times are good and if times turn bad, the servicers merely need to be paid by BT and continue executing. Commoditized assets tend to be well-studied and can be statistically modeled easily by many parties. I.e. The risk is easier to understand and peg correctly. For example, when underwriting auto loans or credit card receivables, an investor can study the statistical default behavior per FICO band and apply that credit behavior to a similar investment opportunity. As such, because the assets under this umbrella are bid more competitively, the advance rate required to win these deals tends to be higher. As such, what BT gains in lower originator-specific risk it loses in credit/leverage risk. Pipeline Review: Case Study - Project Titan (Not the borrower\u2019s real name) Titan offers clients a Credit Card as a Service. An embedded finance technology firm, Titan offers a suite of banking, cards, credit cards, and reward products that enable vendors and other FinTech firms to launch branded programs. Titan\u2019s Credit Card as a Service feature that functions as an out-of-the-box back end for credit card portfolios launched by branded clients. Titan\u2019s CCaaS addresses the entire product flow\u2014underwriting, financing, processing, bespoke rewards programs, as well as servicing of the underlying. The firm was founded in 2016 and currently has 444 employees. In a recent Series C, the company raised $52MM at a $472MM post-money valuation. Value-Add for Clients:  End-to-end functionality for clients to set up platform and launch self-branded card program in 90 days or less Modular services allow client flexibility to choose services based on differing needs, including marketing support, prototyping, and additional operations  Value-Add for End-Borrowers:  Compliant credit card with cashback, competitive interest rates and special branded rewards program Efficient application process, intuitive design interface, and established servicing process combined with dependable financial technology  Selection of Terms & Conditions:  90% advance rate against credit card receivables Titan to provide a principal guarantee of up to 10% and will maintain a forward-looking interest reserve, making BT\u2019s effective advance rate 85-89% of the receivables 11% interest rate  Investment Opportunity: Titan is seeking senior funding for the Credit Card as a Service offering in order to finance customer card programs launched by clients. BlockTower will consider opening a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility to Titan with a 3-year term, drawable against eligible collateral.  Servicing and Reporting As part of the servicing agreement between Maker and BlockTower Credit, BTCR will be expected to consistently deliver credit reporting as per the needs of MakerDAO and the core units managing the relationship (CES, SF). These expectations will be broken down in two buckets: Matter and Form. Matter: On a monthly basis BlockTower will provide MakerDAO reporting at an asset level, vault level, and portfolio level. The asset-level analysis will provide insight into the performance of individual BlockTower exposures. I.e. Senior Secured Facilities, Forward Flow arrangements, or Whole Loans/Receivables. Key data will include payment status, debt service coverage ratios, idiosyncratic risk factors, sector and geography risk factors, and qualitative description (addendum to payment status) of month-over-month credit erosion or future expected credit issues. For purposes of protecting the privacy of borrowers, data will be anonymized. The vault-level analysis will roll-up the performance/reporting of the underlying assets of a given vault, or CFG pool. Key data will include debt service coverage ratios, TIN subordination, payment status, and payment history. This analysis is important because there are cross-collateralization or portfolio-wide events of default triggered if 3 of 4 vaults fail to maintain the required TIN subordination. The portfolio-level analysis will roll-up the performance/reporting of each of the four Maker vaults (CFG pools) into one snapshot, the most important features of which will be the portfolio-level TIN subordination, portfolio-level debt service coverage ratio (DSCR: what is the spread between BTCR\u2019s interest obligation to MakerDAO and the interest collections on its assets) and the concentration matrix (i.e. how lumpy is the portfolio vis a vis single exposures, single borrowers, business sectors, and geographies). Portfolio-wide DSCR is a particularly important data point because if this metric falls below 1.5x it is an event of default. Finally, BTCR will provide details on the existence of any other Events of Default (EOD) or broken covenants. Note: BTCR will provide summary metrics that correspond specifically to Maker Protocol values (debt ceiling, capitalizable stability fees etc.). As it invests in and builds out internal technology, in an effort to increase transparency, BTCR endeavors to provide more dynamic reporting dashboards over time. Form: The above content will be published monthly on the Forums and uploaded to one of Arweave, IPFS, or Pinata. Though PDFs and dashboards are helpful for human digestion, BlockTower will provide a machine-readable version alongside. This means that all relevant data will be submitted in a spreadsheet. For further detail on the substance of the reported data, please refer to the Service Agreement and BTCR Reporting.  Expected Credit Loss To set the context for understanding the losses analysis, it\u2019s important to reinforce how the BT structure differs from that of HVB. In the HVB deal, Maker and HVB shared the risk of credit loss on loans equally. This is because Maker participated directly in the underlying loans alongside HVB. The first dollar of loss on the underlying loans would therefore be borne pari passu by Maker and HVB. As proposed, the BlockTower deal differs in two key ways that will each effect how we think about the probability of credit losses for MKR holders:   Maker\u2019s Credit Enhancement: Maker benefits from a TIN threshold, or first-loss tranche of at least 30% below it. BTCR will retain the entirety of this on each of the four vaults. As such, the first dollar of loss on BlockTower\u2019s originated assets (Senior Secured Facilities, Forward Flow Arrangements, and Whole Loans/Receivables), will not be borne by Maker. In fact, for Maker to experience one DAI of loss on its senior position, BlockTower\u2019s assets would have to experience 30% losses.   Senior Secured Facility vs. Underlying Loans: Although BTCR does retain the right to originate underlying loans outright (Forward Flow Facilities, Whole Loans, Receivables), BTCR intends to allocate a significant portion of its portfolio (two vaults) to Senior Secured Facilities. Because such facilities typically advance <100% against underlying loans and receivables being originated by BTCR\u2019s borrowers, there exists an additional buffer to absorb losses at the underlying loan level before they hit Maker (\u201cadditional\u201d because there, of course, exists a 30% TIN piece under Maker already).   BlockTower Internal Expected Losses Though BTCR\u2019s current pipeline is merely illustrative and thus not indicative of the actual portfolio at full deployment, because the fund has oriented around a particular credit strategy (discussed in previous sections such as BlockTower - Originator/Sponsor Overview + Credit Policy and Investment Process), it is able to project internally expected credit losses on its portfolio. For the abundance of clarity, BTCR\u2019s loss rate will always exceed Maker\u2019s loss rate due to the factors discussed in the prior section (i.e. credit enhancements). For the less liquid portion of BTCR\u2019s portfolio, which includes senior secured facilities, forward flow arrangements, whole loans, and receivables, BTCR underwrites to zero loss. For the liquid portion of BTCR\u2019s portfolio (i.e. structured credit products), which includes investment grade (>BBB-) asset-backed securities, historical loss rates on similar assets are well-established. BTCR also underwrites to zero loss. BTCR Portfolio Expected Loss Rate: 0%. Independent Expected Loss Analysis As a basis for the expected losses analysis, we used a combined analysis:  Historical loss data from a top 10 US trade finance lender (operating for 30 years) Support for A) from ICC\u2019s 2021 Trade Register Report on Trade Finance Assets Historical loss data from public asset-backed securities (ABS) data  We settled on ABS data because it is A) publicly available and B) most adequately resembles the sorts of assets Maker is ultimately exposed to. It would not be appropriate to gauge BlockTower\u2019s loss rates purely on ABS data because ABS bonds benefit intrinsically from better diversification properties and better liquidity properties than the illiquid (read: senior secured facilities, whole loans, and receivables) parts of BlockTower\u2019s portfolio. Of course, BlockTower\u2019s 70MM exposure to investment grade ABS is perfectly matched by this analysis. If its expected losses across the 150MM portfolio are based purely on public ABS data, Maker would have to use judgment in order to calculate the further expected loss buffer needed to account for the lumpier losses and liquidity risk. Instead of making that judgment, we contacted previous business contacts and colleagues at factoring companies, broader trade finance lenders, as well as private credit funds to establish more accurate loss spreads based on private market data. After deliberation, we chose to utilize the losses data of a single, large trade finance lender because it went back twenty years. Further, given the significant overlap between this lender\u2019s assets and jurisdiction, we felt it was a reasonable compromise. Please keep in mind that, because our private market data is derived from a single, albeit large trade finance factor, it will not fully account for A) trade finance assets outside of factoring and supply chain finance B) the range of quality in originators that BTCR will face and C) the range of industries/sectors that BlockTower will originate in D) a general range in market performance. Top 10 US TFA Factor: Historical Losses Due to the originator wishing to remain anonymous, we will nickname it \u201cGoblin Factor\u201d. Goblin Factor is a factor and supply chain finance lender in the United States/Canada and has been originating invoices for 30 years on its own balance sheet. Unlike many TFA \u201clenders\u201d who connect a supply of trade finance assets (invoices) with a litany of buyers in a marketplace, Goblin Factor retains the majority of the risk of its exposures. As such, it has managed cycles and the concomitant workouts in-house. Goblin Factor originates assets with maturities up to 120 days. Over 10, 15, and twenty year time horizons, Goblin Factor\u2019s annual loss rate on its portfolio has averaged ~1.25%. 2021 ICC Trade Register Report - Trade Finance Assets  1592\u00d7796 162 KB  According to ICC, default rates in 2020, a distressed year for trade finance lenders, were generally below 1.0%, with losses given default presumably below that. This is well inside Factoring Goblin\u2019s annual loss rate of 1.25%, which should bring comfort to MKR holders. Public Asset-Backed Securities Data: Historical Losses The natural, conservative place to begin is to look at those ABS bonds that were exposed to the worst economic conditions over the last cycle: 2006-2008 vintage. For our purposes, we will look at two metrics: credit upgrades/downgrades and cumulative net loss (CNL). Credit upgrades/downgrades: Each tranche in a securitization is rated by a credit rating agency, typically Moody\u2019s, Fitch, S&P, or DBRS. If the credit characteristics of a given tranche erode, the agencies will re-rate the bond. We can therefore look to downgrades as a proxy for the downside surprise of a given bond\u2019s performance relative to its expected performance at securitization.  790\u00d71309 177 KB  During the 2006-2008 vintage, we saw upgrades outnumber downgrades by a ratio of 115:1. Cumulative net loss (CNL): According to a 2018 report by JP Morgan, auto ABS, both prime and nonprime, held up well through the financial crisis, experiencing no defaults. Facing possible default, HATS 2016-1 C was the first auto ABS downgraded to CCC since the late 1990s. The report explains that the HATS downgrade is an isolated case and not representative of broad subprime auto trends. In the same report, JP Morgan analyzes credit card ABS, which experienced similarly trivial defaults. Advanta Business Card Master Trust (ABCMT), a trust backed by credit card receivables to small business, was the only GFC-era card ABS trust to experience defaults. ABCMT filed for bankruptcy in 11/2009, entered receivership, and transferred servicing to special. In the end, the C and D tranches experienced complete principal loss while the B experienced partial loss of 5%. These losses would\u2019ve eroded the junior portion of the B tranche (in most securitizations this would be B/BB). BlockTower does not invest below BBB-, or investment grade. Moving on to contemporary securitizations of the vintage that BlockTower may be purchasing, we will look at 2022 auto ABS securitizations. 2022 Auto ABS bonds FCAT 2022-4, CRVANA 2022-P3, and WLAKE 2022-2 have expected cumulative net losses (CNL) of 11.50%, 2.50-3.00%, and 12.50%-13.00%, respectively. Due to the BBB bonds benefiting from substantial credit enhancement, the loss multiple required for the BBB tranches of the aforementioned securitizations to experience a dollar of loss are 2.07x, 2.5x, and 1.75x, respectively. See the vintage loss analysis for such shelves below.  986\u00d7976 144 KB   1290\u00d7902 124 KB   1600\u00d7488 120 KB  For the interested reader, further ABS data can be found via Guggenheim or KBRA. Securitization data tells us that ABS bonds with an investment grade rating, a minimum requirement for BlockTower\u2019s investment, are extremely unlikely to experience losses. Expected Losses - Conclusion Our expected losses analysis consists of three components, the historical losses data of Goblin Factor, a broader ICC report on Trade Finance Asset performance in 2020/2021, and the historical losses of like-kind ABS bonds. The former will help us gauge losses on BlockTower\u2019s senior secured facilities, whole loans, and receivables while the latter will be more useful for BlockTower\u2019s investment grade structured products. Expected Losses on Vaults 2 and 3 (Senior Secured Facilities) Trade Finance: Because Factoring Goblin\u2019s historical loss rates are higher than ICC\u2019s 2020/2021 trade finance industry numbers, we will ignore ICC numbers in favor of the more conservative figures. Factoring Goblin has experienced a 1.25% annual loss rate over twenty years. Because its senior secured facility is underwritten at a 90% advance rate, its senior lender retains an 8x cushion. In this analogy, BlockTower would act as this senior lender. BlockTower does indeed intend to utilize each of two of its four vaults for the origination of senior secured facilities to single originators (originators = same position as Factoring Goblin). Now, given that Factoring Goblin is able to access a senior secured facility from a top 10 international bank, it is of course lower risk than BlockTower\u2019s borrowers. As such, we expect BlockTower\u2019s borrowers to perform more poorly. As such, we will underwrite a conservative 5x decrease in performance relative to Factoring Goblin, or with an average annual loss rate of 6.25% on their assets. BlockTower retains the right to originate senior secured facilities with 100% advance rates, though they\u2019re unlikely to originate such highly-levered facilities without additional protections. Maker will project, conservatively, expected annual losses of 5% to BlockTower Credit on its senior secured facilities which will compose 60M of a total 150MM (two vaults). Due to Maker\u2019s 30% cushion, we do not expect Maker to take losses on those two vaults over the course of its facility. Expected Losses on Vault 1 (Whole Loans/Receivables) The performance of Factoring Goblin also helps us understand the loss rate BlockTower can expect on the whole loans and receivables it buys outright. BlockTower intends to use one vault, the 20MM one, to originate such assets. We can map the loss rate on this vault directly to the average annual loss rate contemplated above: Maker will project, conservatively, expected annual losses of 6.25% to BlockTower Credit on the whole loans and receivables it buys which compose 20MM of a total 150MM. Due to Maker\u2019s 30% cushion, we do not expect Maker to take losses on this vault over the course of its facility. Expected Losses on Vault 4 (Structured Credit Products) ABS: Rather than accounting for any credit risk (which is seemingly trivial) to investment grade bonds, we will consider binary black swans. An example might be if capital markets erode rapidly, causing a credit crunch, and at the same time crypto is outlawed, forcing BlockTower to unwind its entire bond position immediately. Another example might be systemic fraud at the level of the entity originating the auto loans or credit card receivables to be sold into securitization. **As such, Maker will project, conservatively, expected annual losses of 2% to BlockTower Credit on the investment grade structured credit products it buys which compose 70MM of a total 150MM. Due to Maker\u2019s 30% cushion, we do not expect Maker to take losses on this vault over the course of its facility. Conclusion: Maker Cushion, Expected Loss In the case of Vault 1, which will be used to originate Whole Loans and Receivables, Maker is expected to retain a 4.8x (30% TIN/6.25%) cushion. In the case of Vaults 2 and 3, which will be used to originate Senior Secured Facilities, Maker is expected to retain a 6x cushion (30% TIN/5%). In the case of Vault 4, Maker is expected to retain a 15x cushion (30% TIN/2). Due to the substantial credit enhancement provided by BlockTower Credit and the expected behavior of the underlying collateral, we do not expect Maker to incur losses. @BlockTower @strat-fin-core-unit @collateral-core-unit ",
