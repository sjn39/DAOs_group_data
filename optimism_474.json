How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: Poolz will be official partners and act as one of the main Launchpad over the network. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Poolz will join a Official partners to the ecosystem and as the main Launchpad platform. Today, almost every early stage need for a launchpad platform in order to build them go to market strategy. To date, we have done about 100 such processes with companies and helped them grow and enter the market correctly. This is exactly what we want to do with projects that build on the OP network. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: no Number of OP tokens requested: 30000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: Yes If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: didnt requested How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): Our goal is to do joint campaigns as much as possible, we added more examples in the question about detailing the grant and the steps from our side, main points: - Poolz will host IDO\u2019s on the network - Poolz will open dedicated grant for project that build on the networks - Poolz ventures will invest in early stage project that build on the network Poolz will attract high-quality projects to build on OP, act as OP ambassadors, and will help to expand the ecosystem. How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): Poolz will attract high-quality projects to build on OP, act as OP ambassadors, and will help to expand the ecosystem. The key points behind this partnership are:1. Poolz deploys the Poolz Launchpad code over OP Network.2. Poolz deploys the Claiming System protect over OP Network(60% Foundation and DAO members - point 1 +2) Testnet + Mainnet for both.3. (20%) Actives users and marketing plan as well and involve our KOl\u2019s (250) please find KPI\u2019s info: Poolz KPI's .pdf - Google DriveFuture plans:4. (20%) Projects built on OP can apply for co-grants from Poolz Finance and OP Labs - Poolz - Invest in the future leaders of Web35. Poolz Ventures will invest in projects that build OP.https://ventures.poolz.finance/we are aiming to become a leading player in the ecosystem with a reputation and experience in the launchpad field. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: Shorter time: - 10% Marketing - section 3 - for Poolz KOl\u2019s - 10% will allocated to actives users- 20% ecosystem reward - section 4 from the milestones - co-grants- 60% Foundation and DAO members Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: 1. Testnst - deploy 2. Mainnet Net - deploy3. Poolz Community engagement campaign over OP (using Poolz KOL\u2019s army and missions)4. ecosystem reward - section 4 from the milestones - co-grants // Poolz Co-Grant with OP opening for new project to build on the network and using Poolz IDO as well Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: As Poor as a launchpad in ongoing platform that able to host OP base project to thier on IDO and manage the activities over the network. In this case the users will have to hold OP native token as part of the platfrom activities Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): - Poolz Open source code: Poolz \u00b7 GitHub Confirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here): I have read the Eligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions ",
