                    "content": "As the idea to print unbacked DAI is discussed here and here and on the chat, I think we need to know the position of the overall community to either work the idea or stop it (didn\u2019t find a poll about that). Full disclosure I\u2019m against so keep in mind while reading the rest of this post. First, from the whitepaper it seems clear to me that 1DAI = $1 at the ES.  Every Dai in circulation is directly backed by excess collateral, meaning that the value of the collateral is higher than the value of the Dai debt  Changing that would break the promise. I think trust is important and once broken it no longer can be restored. Are you ready to trust the USA to go back and keep the gold standard for 100 years if they say so? Me neither. The second argument is from a balance sheet point of view. The equity part of the Maker balance sheet is actually the surplus buffer, i.e. almost nothing. Printing DAI would mean having a negative equity quickly therefore being insolvent. Central banks don\u2019t print money, they expand their balance sheet (similarly to the aDAI/cDAI discussion). Place to add any con argument, let me know what to add Nevertheless, there are some good arguments for printing unbacked DAI. The inability to solve the peg issue is a trust issue as well and some might object that USDT is the stablecoin leader while being probably insolvent. Printing unbacked DAI would be only temporary and solved by either the stability fees or by issuing MKR tokens. The MKR market cap is worth more than all DAI issued, it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Another way to look at it is that the public see DAI as having more value than the collateral (collateral + utility value). It can be the censorship resistance or whatever, but DAI is worth $1.015 for some people for a reason. Place to add any pro argument, let me know what to add Choose your camp carefully or dai. Post poll results : The poll was closed 7d after the start and 5d after the last comment. It show that the Maker community in majority feel that the promise of 1 DAI = $1 of collateral at any time is essential. Still one fifth are okay to have it lower than $1 and one fifth don\u2019t have a clear opinion at the time.     yes, 1 DAI can be backed by less than $1 of collateral to solve the peg issue no, 1 DAI = $1 of collateral, that\u2019s the promise abstain     0 voters     ",

You can buy USDC, instead of let maker doing it. You can buy MKR. You can buy ETH. You can buy Uniswap token. Or you can use it to pay your new Lamborghini, that what most central banks do.

                    "content": "MKR market cap is the market evaluation of the equity part of Maker. It\u2019s not on Maker balance sheet. Maybe there is another Maker asset somewhere that I\u2019m not aware of. You are right. We can print as many DAI as we want. It will be on the asset side and the liability side of Maker balance sheet, let\u2019s say 100. Then you can buy 100 USDC so there will be 100 USDC on the asset side, 100 DAI on the liability side and a small profit (let\u2019s say 2 DAI remaining on the asset side therefore expanding the equity of Maker). That\u2019s the PSM idea. It\u2019s quite different from buying MKR and burning them. This way you end up with 100 DAI as liability and nothing on the asset side which mean a loss that reduce equity. You can buy MKR or ETH with such DAI, but there would be no buffer to sustain any drop. Issuing DAI is issuing an awesome debt (no interest, no redemption date except ES). We let our clients issue the debt but don\u2019t use it ourselves. As we don\u2019t have equity (or so few) issuing DAI would be like having a vault with a LR of 101%. Maybe we need to issue equity (issuing MKR for ETH), leverage it by issuing DAI debt and investing it in Compound, Aave and Uniswap (directly positive for earnings per MKR token). Stop trying to be a central bank and be a bank. People want Maker debt, they are ready to pay negative interest rates (by buying above par). As we can see by the peg situation, letting third parties managing Maker balance sheet isn\u2019t working very well regarding the peg. But not having an equity base limits our ability to manage it. I\u2019m on the side to kept the system solvent but some don\u2019t, which is the reason of this poll. Obviously, wanting to manage the balance sheet would create a lot of technical and managerial issues for MakerDAO. Maybe it\u2019s too early for that. ",

My minority opinion is that we should distinguish two values and do not consider them being equal:   Amount of collateral backing up each DAI Price of DAI  and we should stabilize second by lowering first (by minting unbacked DAI and selling them off for MKR), or under opposite circumstances  (high SF, dai below the peg) buying it back.  For me it looks like Mak\u2026     I believe that two promises MakerDAO gives  Each DAI is backed by at least 1 USD of collateral DAI is exchangable for 1 USD  contradict each other since they do not acount for both additional utility of holding DAI instead of holding USD and opportunity cost of it. For instance due to Compound decisions currently You can have around 30% APY (assuming more or less stable comp token value) with depositing dai and borrowing Tether and making leverage on that several times over That quite some utility of DAI that USD do not have. And it should (and does) drive DAI price up above 1$ ",

I think DAI will have more and more peaks above 1.05 but it won\u2019t get much higher due to people selling it for USDC or other tokens for immediate profit. At that point DAI will be only useful as a store of value for those who bough it at a reasonable price (similar to BTC). Remember that DAI is backed by USD, but USD is backed by nothing as it is the only way to be useful as a currency. I think we need to be somewhere in between those 2 extremes. ",

I don\u2019t see how DAI can both be backed by $1 of collateral and trade at $1, given that there is extra utility from being part of a widely-trusted and widely-adopted network. From my perspective as a user \u201cDAI is exchangeable for 1 USD\u201d is the core value prop of DAI, and thus an end-in-itself. \u201cDAI is backed by 1 USD of collateral\u201d is just a means to that end. So if they are in conflict, it seems clear that the DAI backing should be sacrificed, rather than the stable peg. For me, this is not just hypothetical\u2013I run the SourceCred treasury and currently we pay all of our contributors in DAI, but Grain is pegged to USD, so I\u2019ve started needing to do spot currency price conversions every time someone redeems their Grain. It\u2019s a pain. For us to keep using DAI long term, it\u2019s important that Maker finds a way to keep a stable peg. ",

I think you should think that its such a good product with high demand that we will be able to suck in almost all assets in the world with super low rates due to high DAI demand. Your argument sounds like a short term problem until A) We scale to billions and B) We make efficiencies in collateral/liquidations so that LR can be lower. Perhaps one day we can get to a point when the trust of the system alone allows the whole system to be under-collateralized but I hope not as that just returns to the current economic problems we face today.

The whole problem is that dai is extremely attractive. That\u2019s what it means that it\u2019s more valuable than the usd. If we want to break peg we can, but otherwise we have to find ways to be a LESS robust/attractive currency. I think it is true that we either have to blaze our own trail and break usd peg though, or break some of our rigid ideals around collateralization. An interesting compromise here is simply lowering the vault collateralization requirements across the board. Atm we are not just 100% collateralized by usd, but significantly overcollateralized. I think the average right now in between 200-300%. It\u2019s actually incredible that we\u2019ve kept the peg so well with such low capital utilization. We could either print unbacked dai, or lower minimum CR and still maintain overcollateralization on a system wide level. ",

For instance Maker could mint x amount of unbacked DAI and deposit it into yCRV until the point DAI is $1 or whatever price ceiling you want (same idea as PSM). The difference with PSM is that Maker starts earning 60%+ on farming fees, the downside is that Maker gets directly exposed to other protocols and collateralization is closer to 1:1. Also, if community was in favour of PSM and potentially increased stablecoin exposure with lower collateralization, similar mechanics could be reached quickly by having very low liquidation ratio for USDC or other potential stablecoins. For instance having 102% LR for USDC puts a price ceiling on DAI at $1.02. The difference with PSM is that protocol takes more risks when unwinding those vaults. Only certain users can unwind it when DAI price falls enough or governance would need to manually liquidate such vaults when price stabilizes. ",

Free banking notes were just that. The issue is that the demand, instead of pushing the supply, is impacting the price. The USDC-A vault with 110% LR is providing a cap at 1 DAI < 1.1 USDC but it\u2019s not enough. Having USDC-A vault at 101% LR will make liquidation difficult. The intent on strategic reserves is a way to provide MakerDAO the ability to generate the supply leveraging a USDC-A vault. One step further would be to have a USDC-M vault (M for Marker or Market Operation) only available to the Strategic Reserves with a 100% LR  and a negative risk premium (so SF is always 0%). It shouldn\u2019t be too hard to do (let me know if I\u2019m mistaken). This hasn\u2019t any liquidation issue has MakerDAO can close those vaults any time (MakerDAO control the strategic reserves). At worst (USDC goes to 0$) this has the same effect than printing unbacked DAI. Aside of that, each DAI still has 1$ of collateral (as each DAI is backed by 1 USDC = 1$). The SF is useless as any SF would be both an expense and an income for Maker (netting 0), just making things complicated. We can print almost unlimited DAI and still keep 1 DAI being backed by 1$ of collateral with almost no initial capital. By construction, we can push 1 DAI = 1$ and make a profit. When available, same can go with others stablecoins (to diversify custody risk) and with cDAI (no custody risk, but a protocol and liquidity risk). But just with USDC, we can mint almost 130M DAI and not exceed current risk appetite. Does that seems acceptable to both those wanting to keep 1 DAI = 1$ of collateral and those who want to print unbacked DAI to solve the peg issue? It seems to me a kind of middle ground. If there is traction and nothing I missed, I can push the idea (as is or improved by the discussion) forward. ",
