Therefore, we spend a lot of time checking data and trying to understand discrepancies (which is an endless task). Today, we will make 320M DAIs, that are \u201cbadly\u201d accounted for, disappear (actually only 66M but anyone can make the rest go away). It is not impacting anything in the system. If you go on MakerBurn, you will get a total DAI supply of 9.6B.  image871\u00d7182 57.2 KB  If you go to the vat we get the confirmation by reading debt (which represent the balance sheet size of makerDAO and not it\u2019s debt).  You can check how much dai sit in the vow. It\u2019s around 380M. What?  You could have go to check the sin of the Vow in the Vatand you would have get 320M. 380-320 = 60M DAI which is the actual number of the Surplus Buffer. Going to the vow we can see that there is 310M of Sin or uncleared bad debt (Sin is not the same as sin). You can clean it by calling flog after 6 days.  So there are 310M that are still being \u201cin liquidation\u201d. So after the flog of timestamp 1642806005 (the biggest liquidation) and a heal, we drop the reported DAI supply by 66.7M DAI. And voil\u00e0 the results:  image879\u00d7171 56.4 KB  Anyone can clean the rest of the 320M (but there is plenty of flog to call, 1824 calls to be made it seems). The matter was already discussed here and you can read more in the Vow documentation. Such accounting glitch is dealt with only when there is a Flop needed. (because it is not needed before). Yet it could mislead people as the current situation was an overestimation of 3% of the dai supply. Nothing to worry about but if we get liquidations and never a flop, this will only increase. ",

One of the biggest issues in operations is having consistent data that reflects the actual state of a system.  This is particularly true if this data is also an input to automation software. BTW:  The above looks like an issue that would live in a Maker Operations domain.  One thing I wonder is why flog isn\u2019t called when an auction is dealt?  Force the liquidator when making an auction claim to pay the gas to flog. ",

I exclude the 320M DAI discussed in this post, the Surplus Buffer (59M, which is not outstanding DAI) and the DAI on the CU wallets (8M). ERC-20 DAI is 9,141M according to etherscan (but missing the 114M DAI in the DSR that are no longer ERC-20 DAI). For ALM work I\u2019m also considering if we should retreat some D3M or G-UNI DAI/USDC. Indeed, the non lent DAI in D3M are not exercising any pressure on the DAI price nor are they owned by anyone else but MakerDAO. Therefore, are they really outstanding?     MakerMan:  Also what was the onchain cost of doing the 1 flog?   $5 this morning.     MakerMan:  Personally I think seeing inaccurate data is a problem.   Perfect data don\u2019t exist. This flog issue is easy to fix and start to become significant (it could be called only 6 days after the auction). Maybe for @techops-core-unit ? Using the vat.debt as the DAI outstanding is not correct (in my accounting framework, which could be challenged as well) but accurate enough. There is value in taking a direct metric from the blockchain. It\u2019s always a matter of being significant. Above 3% is most likely significant especially as the gap might grow and grow. ",

Therefore, are they really outstanding?   Good question on whether that D3M is really outstanding since Maker can make it vanish.  It does pay fees though and can be borrowed (even if it isn\u2019t).   I have been harping on DAI liquidity issues ever since my first forum posts.   D3M is a interesting way to provide liquidity to manage borrow rates even though it is dependent on AAVE portfolio integrity.  I look at this like a IV where we basically are rate managing.     SebVentures:  $5 this morning.   Yeah gwei was low.  So $5 given what 50-60gwei gas cost.   I probably should just look at the gas the tx consumed.   This was more a curiousity since if 1840 are out there to be done this means almost $100K worth of ETH to clear this.     SebVentures:  Perfect data don\u2019t exist   This is what error bars are for.   Error bars on data are supposed to give statistical limits on data quality.   Basically what your post highlights is that Makerburn DAI outstanding is off by appproximately 3% at the moment, and this will be related to auctions. Hopefully @makerburn will address this issue. I have worked with both measurement and theoretical datasets ever since college.   This is both from a modelling perspective (checking that various theoretical approaches give similar result trends) as well as a quality assurance from experimental or operational data measurement standards.   Data quality is a whole field unto itself.   I can\u2019t count the times I have seen reports that don\u2019t have measurement units in legends, much less error bars in data.   Even in my BT report where I compare to market I didn\u2019t bother to try to apply error bars in the \u2018market\u2019 prices to compute losses with a more accurate statistical modeling related to market prices taken at the time.  Put simply coming up with error bars that have any statistical meaning is either impossible or very hard.  There are real practical issues that a cursory look at data quality can show how strong a presentation thesis might be.  In the case of the BT analysis that was meant to be a cursory vs. an exhaustive look at liquidation performance and come up with a first shot model with numbers to consider compensation. There are times when data inaccuracy isn\u2019t sufficient to change a story.   It is when this inaccuracy leads to other problems that one has to go back and work on the data inputs as well as changing the models that rely on these inputs. Even so.  I wanted to say to you @SebVentures and @Aes I appreciate being flagged and highlighted to this stuff.   I found things in the BT analysis that TO DATE not one other person has found, or flagged (or at least they have not done so publicly).   It is doing this kind of data integrity checking that leads to better data and data analytics and so I have a high appreciation for this kind of Quality Assurance checking. This makes me feel good about the quality of work the SF CU will be doing in the future and I look forward to seeing what your team turns up over time. ",
