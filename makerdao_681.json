The Ambassador Program\u2019s pilot funding has been disrupted by the offboarding of the Content Production core unit. We are seeking 25,000 DAI to complete our pilot and the projects we started over the next three months. This includes:  Weekly translations of governance updates Full translation of MOM Translation of the Community Portal Organization of meetups Represent MakerDAO at conferences Building engagement on the @makerdao_lat twitter  During the pilot program the ambassadors have:  Translated weekly governance materials (G+R Snippet, Relay, Polls, Dailights) Translated video subtitles for \u201cHow to Vote\u201d video Translated major portions of the MOM Translated important MIPS Participated in virtual meetups Created the @makerdao_lat Twitter account   Option One - Fund Pilot Program:  Pros  Continued weekly translation of governance materials Evergreen resources for the Spanish-speaking MakerDAO community Increased engagement with Latin American community   Cons  Will cost the DAO 25,000 DAI Project should probably be an SPF, but timing of the offboarding makes that option too delayed.

I would like to see Monthly Governance Reviews and Forum at a Glance translated. Forum posts are almost always in English. There is the opportunity for GovComms to even further scale the Forum at a Glance to provide more and greater detailed TL;DRs of the forums, which can then be translated into Spanish and help unlock the entire Latin American audience to our forum activities.

The multisig doesn\u2019t need to be created until after the poll, but indicating who the signers are, what the signing threshold is (how many signers to take an action), and expectations on reporting the expenditures should be listed so MKR voters can make an informed decision when this gets on chain.  This item was put through the signal process rather than having to go the MIPs route due to the urgency/unfinished business from the offboarding of the Content Production CU.

This should be put in place so that in the event that 2 or more keys are lost/compromised, the funding can be pulled back through an executive vote. Spending limits for the multisig can be viewed here. Most Core Units use a spending limit of 1B DAI, but anything over 25,000 would suffice for these purposes. Please let me know if you need assistance setting up the spending limit transaction @kat , @Davidutro , and @tadeo  ",

For many reasons (mainly economic, I can expand on this if anyone wants to) there is a lot of crypto adoption here in LATAM, the ecosystem is solid and it\u00b4s growing, and stablecoins are the key. DAI is a benchmark, the second most adopted stablecoin in the region. There is still a lot to do here.      NoeliS:  I heard about MEC in some but I\u2019m not in the group. Does the project have a Telegram or Discord account?   Hi NoeliS, you can find all the contacts HERE. See you in the next DeFi LATAM meetup! ",
