                    "content": "Hello everyone! While working on a spreadsheet to track all the past and present MIPs, I\u2019ve been running into a few problems. Some of them are a me thing (like not finding info right in front of me) but there are a couple that I think point to a greater need for the community. This poll is to see if anyone else thinks that adding a search function to the voter portal would be worth the dev work required to do so. Fairly certain this feature is self-explanatory, but just in case, I\u2019m asking that a little search icon with functionality to look for titles or topics of past votes be added to the portal, not dissimilar from the feature on the top right of this site (the forum) where you can search for previous and ongoing topics. I believe this feature would be worth the hours to build it for the following reasons:  Search functionality makes research on historical actions much easier There are several people working on MIP portals/trackers all of which have to be able to confirm the data they are producing (ie check to make sure MIPX actually passed) Current titles of executive votes make it near impossible to see what was voted on without actually clicking the link to the summary New users will expect some search functionality when visiting the portal for the first time The time spent by devs making the functionality will be repaid in by contributors\u2019 time savings for having the feature  The cons (as I see them):  Adds unnecessary work to a busy team Could cost a decent amount of DAI to make happen Risks down time/something going wrong on the voter portal in order to be implemented  I am conducting this poll after posting in the Rocket.Chat Dev channel and being told that this could be done if there is enough community support. I will leave the poll open for the standard two weeks, and will link this post in the Chat as a gauge of community interest. If you have a problem with any of the points I\u2019ve made/think this is improper please let your comments be known!    Adding Search Functionality to Maker Voter Portal  For Against Abstain     0 voters     ",

While waiting for it, maybe a simple page gathering all  MIP, with a title, a status and maybe one 2 lines explaining the content could be helpful.
