                    "content": "I have been brainstorming different methods for making volatile crypto assets like ETH be a little more reliable as collateral and less likely to result in sudden liquidations. One idea is a token that is perpetually worth $1 of the [time-weighted?] average cost of ETH over the past month (or even year)\u2026kind of like what UMA is doing with the yield dollar but without an expiry and based on an average cost that wouldn\u2019t move as quickly so that people would have more time to repay or add more collateral to avoid liquidation. In turn, maybe MakerDAO could lend a greater amount of DAI. Is anyone working on something like this? ",

Before the release of MCD (multi-collateral-DAI) Rune announced that MakerDAO was planning to have Euro-DAI and KRW-Dai. Technically, these are just other stablecoins, just like DAI, and only need additional Oracles. The idea was to back them with DAI (i.e., usd pegged, the main product of MakerDAO). Your stable-ETH is just another example of this. I don\u2019t really know what happened, but these ideas has not been discussed for months now. ",
