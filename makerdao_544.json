                    "content": "Hello, I\u2019m conducting research into whether an org like Maker has a need to find new trustworthy vendors for non-continuous (contract) work? Is there a need for a more efficient (preferably decentralized) RPF and bidding and contracting process? A symptom of such a need might be that there are a narrow selection of vendors and reliance on networking/referrals for any novel work, which would suggest that choice in qualified vendors is limited. Any thoughts welcome, and apologies if this is the wrong place to ask. Best, B ",
