                    "content": " What Can Maker Learn/Borrow From Optimism\u2019s New Governance Model?   I am a technology lawyer and academic who has been in and around DeFi since 2020. My specific research interest is decentralised governance, and in that vein, Optimism\u2019s announcement last week represents a pretty fascinating new experiment in how a decentralised protocol might be managed. Optimism and MakerDAO are obviously very different kinds of projects, with different goals, but I think that the Optimism model is still worth examining with an eye to what we might learn or borrow to improve Maker governance. I\u2019ve set out a few thoughts below. NB - I have no insider knowledge or financial stake in Optimism (I didn\u2019t even qualify for the airdrop!)  tl;dr   Optimism dropped its token (OP) last week, and announced a new governance model   Optimism will be governed by two co-equal chambers: the Token House and the Citizens\u2019 House. The latter is comprised of soulbound (non-transferrable) NFT-holding \u2018citizens\u2019 who cast votes of equal weight   Maker could borrow some of Optimism\u2019s thinking around building a more democratic system for governance. For instance, Maker has an informal \u2018citizen\u2019 model for some governance processes already (see: signal votes). Why not formalise this, maybe with our own soulbound NFTs?   Optimism also offers some exciting ideas for incentivising positive contributions to the community, like retroactive funding. We could trial something similar at Maker - perhaps supplementing SourceCred with retroactive funding for particularly useful governance contributions    Reflections on Optimism\u2019s Governance Vision You have almost certainly already heard that Optimism announced an airdrop of its new OP token. However, it also set out its plan to decentralise governance of the Optimism protocol. This is a big deal for a few reasons: first, Optimism is one of the leading L2 networks. Second, the Optimism team has pushed the boat out - this isn\u2019t a typical road map for decentralisation. Optimism are envisaging a governance structure of two \u201cco-equal chambers\u201d - a Token House and a Citizens\u2019 House:  The upcoming Airdrop #1 establishes the Token House by distributing OP to thousands of addresses that have engaged in positive-sum, community-oriented behavior. Token holders will be able to vote on the distribution of project incentives as a part of a Governance Fund, protocol upgrades, and more.  There isn\u2019t too much to see here: this is a standard coin voting governance system, likely to turn into a plutocracy of OP whales. The implicit promise of Optimism\u2019s announcement is that the Token House will represent the mercurial self-interest of the Optimism community - who want the network to keep running, for incentives to flow, and (probably) for the OP price to appreciate.  Next, the Collective will establish a Citizens\u2019 House to facilitate and govern a process to distribute retroactive public goods funding. Citizenship will be conferred by \u201csoulbound\u201d non-transferrable NFTs, and the set of citizens will grow over time.  On the other hand, the Citizens\u2019 House is something else entirely. My reading of Optimism\u2019s proposal is that Citizens\u2019 House will be governed on a \u2018one person, one vote\u2019 basis. It is a little vague what exactly the Citizens\u2019 House will be responsible for at this stage, beyond deciding how retroactive funding should be distributed. However, if the Citizens\u2019 House is truly meant to be a coequal \u2018branch\u2019, I assume it will receive other key governance responsibilities.  image2000\u00d71000 137 KB  Optimism\u2019s delineated model is explicitly aiming to balance short-term incentives with long-term vision. This is a perennial challenge for any successful protocol - I think this recent discussion in the Maker forum captures this dynamic perfectly. Of course, we don\u2019t know the extent to which Optimism\u2019s model will actually work or not, and that might not be apparent for several years. That said, I think the Optimism vision has two notable features:   It envisages a more democratic system of governance. Plutocratic governance by the token-rich has its problems. Providing more opportunities for all community members to have a meaningful say in governance, like through a Citizens\u2019 House, is a great thing, and in an ideal world stands DeFi apart from TradFi. MakerDAO already does this informally at points, like with signal votes, and Optimism has taken this to a logical conclusion with its more formal \u2018citizenry\u2019.   It explicitly incentivises community contributions (Optimism calls this the \u2018impact = profit\u2019 axiom). Undoubtedly with an eye to its market share and a desire to bootstrap its ecosystem, Optimism is setting up a series of mechanisms to encourage contributions from its wider community. Again, Maker is doing this already  (eg, SourceCred). However, Optimism have some additional cool ideas for building up a community and ecosystem that we could look at. I like retroactive funding in particular - and that doesn\u2019t have to be for Ethereum-wide public goods, per se. We could use it as an additional mechanism to promote good governance at Maker.    Optimism-Inspired Ideas For Maker Governance As stated (not least by the Optimism team), Maker is already doing a lot of things right when it comes to decentralised governance. However, Optimism has injected some exciting thinking into the space, particularly through their conception of citizenship, and use of new reward mechanisms. Maker could borrow some of the more interesting ideas for use in our own governance:   Soulbound NFTs for Maker community members. This could help promote participation in the Maker system and provide signal voters with something a bit more tangible than a forum record to prove their involvement with Maker. It might also help formalise the key idea that the whole community matters at Maker, not just token whales/delegates/CU.   Retroactive funding to support the Maker ecosystem. There are a variety of ways in which Maker could use retroactive funding. One starting point could be an annual vote to reward community members/delegates that have provided the most value to Maker governance over the preceding year. Sometimes it is only clear with the benefit of hindsight which contributions have been particularly important to the protocol, and in this way retroactive funding could complement the week-to-week SourceCred.   For my part, I\u2019m really excited to see how these different experiments in decentralised governance continue to evolve. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about some of these governance issues, and it would be great to read any other thoughts on Optimism\u2019s governance and Maker. ",

                    "content": "Appreciate the post, I wasn\u2019t aware that anyone was going down the Soulbound NFT route. I\u2019ll have to take a closer look at the Optimism stuff when I get a moment. Soulbound NFT for voting idea isn\u2019t super new, it\u2019s an option I\u2019ve been aware of for some time. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve thought about it. If I remember correctly, these were the outstanding points that had occurred to me. #1 - Division of Governance Responsibility between houses It\u2019s not immediately clear how to divide formal governance responsibilities between a token house and a citizens house. Do this wrong or badly and you end up with either one of the houses being meaningless, or the houses deadlocked such that no progress can be made. Take Maker, and imagine that we\u2019ve revamped the executive system such that citizen and token houses are both able to vote on executives. You have a few options here:  Require approval in both houses separately. Require approval in both houses combined (how do you equate a citizen vote versus a token-weight vote?) Have one house\u2019s votes be meaningless.  None of those are great options, so, well, lets try something else. In traditional governments, different houses have different responsibilities and powers. So say instead that you specialize, and give the houses different responsibilities, how do you decide who is responsible for what? Can you divide responsibilities such that the houses are balanced in power? Should you? In an ideal world you take advantage of the benefits of each structure.  Token-weighted structures are sybil-proof and have built in financial incentives. Democratic structures allow for more diverse opinion and discussion, as well as appealing on the level of fairness.  But how to do this in such a way that leverages the advantages of each structure while mitigating the downsides, rather than the reverse? #2 - Issuance and Maintenance of Citizenship Someone needs to determine who gets a soulbound NFT, and who doesn\u2019t. Any clear and publicly known criteria  will be abused via sybil behavior. Furthermore (in Maker), the Token House initially needs to consent to the creation of a meaningful Citizen\u2019s House, which involves giving up some amount of its control of the Maker Protocol. How large is the Citizen House? How large should it be? Why?  I hadn\u2019t really come to any firm conclusion from the above. But the key thought that runs around in my mind is: \u201cWhat problem are we trying to solve?\u201d - I think without having a clear idea of what we\u2019re trying to achieve, adding a second house is too much risk, without any clear reward. In general you don\u2019t want to add complexity to a system unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary to meet its requirements. I don\u2019t have a huge amount to say re: retroactive funding. Feels like less of a governance issue to me, and more of an operational decision. ",

This is fascinating - thanks for the link and for your offer above @Bri174. It makes sense that the key constitutional dilemma is how to balance power between the Token House and the Citizen House. As @LongForWisdom has already pointed out, there is a tightrope to be walked. You don\u2019t want a single house to be too powerful and render the other pointless, but it would also be a disaster to have a \u2018vetocracy\u2019 where the houses are of equal power and the protocol can grind to a halt in the event of disagreement or polarisation. The political scholar Francis Fukuyama is good to read on the dangers of a vetocracy - the prospect is particularly dangerous in a fast-moving space like crypto. An oft-repeated phrase over the last few years has been that DeFi is \u2018speedrunning the history of finance\u2019, but DAOs are on their own speedrun: politics, governance and constitutional design! Looking around the space, it\u2019s hard to deny that Maker and Optimism are ahead of that particular curve. ",
