            "body": "### Background:\n\nUniswap\u2019s [genesis liquidity incentive program](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) ends on Nov 17. The existing program distributed 20 million UNI to LPs over 2 months, split evenly between the WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, and DAI/ETH pools. This works out to 2.5 million UNI per pool, per month.\n\n#### Benefits of UNI distribution to LPs:\n\n* Ongoing incentives allows UNI to be distributed to those providing value in the form of liquidity\n* The incentivized pools are likely to remain the most liquid DEX pair on Ethereum, providing a venue to trade against ETH at virtually any size with zero slippage.\n* Reduced incentives prevents UNI from being distributed \u2018too fast\u2019, marked by all tokens being distributed before the Foundation\u2019s four year vesting has passed.\n\n#### Drawbacks of UNI distribution to LPs:\n\n* Ongoing incentives result in UNI largely being \u2018farmed and dumped\u2019 to earn yield.

Distribute to the same 4 pools, but at half the rate of the genesis distribution. This works out to 1.25 million UNI per month to each of the 4 covered pools (WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, DAI/ETH), for a total of 5M UNI per month, or 10M UNI total over the next 2 months.\n\nPlease see the liquidity incentive [governance plan document](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590) for full details and timelines.\n\n### Temperature check question:\n\nShould Uniswap distribute UNI to liquidity providers per the specifications outlined above?\n\n### Next steps:\n\nThe snapshot poll will be live for 3 days.

                    "content": "Authors: @monet-supply @coopahtroopa Reference: https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/ Summary: This proposal offers the continuation of UNI Liquidity Mining, with reduced incentives to the same four liquidity pools as the genesis program. Abstract: This proposal aims to maintain the status quo, as suggested by @rleshner during the first \u2018unofficial\u2019 community call. (See 1:00) The thought process behind ongoing liquidity mining is as follow:  Liquidity mining is useful for distribution of UNI Distribution of UNI is useful for the decentralization of the protocol Decentralization of the protocol is useful for effective governance.  To maintain the status quo, we propose to incentivize the same liquidity pools. However, the biggest change to this proposal is to reduce the total monthly UNI allocation by half from 10M UNI per month to 5M UNI per month. Current Liquidity Program: In its current form, 10M UNI was distributed each month for a total of two months. This meant that 20M UNI was allocated from September 18th to November 17th. The four pools include in the genesis liquidity mining program included:   WBTC/ETH - 2.5M UNI/month  USDC/ETH - 2.5M UNI/month  USDT/ETH - 2.5M UNI/month  DAI/ETH - 2.5M UNI/month  This breaks down to each pool receiving roughly 83,333 UNI per day or 13.5 UNI per block. Proposed New Liquidity Program: We propose to reduce the liquidity allocation to 5M UNI per month, for another two months. These tokens should be allocated across the same four pools, meaning 10M UNI would be distributed in total as follows:  WBTC/ETH - 1.67M UNI/month USDC/ETH - 1.25M UNI/month USDT/ETH - 1.25M UNI/month DAI/ETH - 0.83M UNI/month  This means each pool would receive 41,666 UNI per day or 6.75 UNI per block. The new Liquidity Mining incentives should begin from the day this proposal is executed, marked by passing an onchain governance vote subject to the UNI governance standards. Initially, this proposal will be reviewed by the community via the temperature check process. A 3 day Snapshot poll will be created for UNI holders, and if the poll passes with a minimum 25,000 UNI support it can move on to the next step. After receiving soft consensus via the temperature check process, this proposal will be posted on Snapshot for off-chain voting in a consensus check poll. Should the proposal pass with more than 50,000 UNI worth of voting weight, it will be moved to an onchain proposal. Motivation: Ongoing liquidity mining incentives allows UNI to be allocated to the community while we search for optimizations to distribution, including vesting and redirection towards other pools and programs like grants, governance participation and third-party integrations. As more UNI enters the circulating supply, the potential for governance votes to pass quorum thresholds becomes more realistic, allowing the community to have a greater impact on the future evolution of Uniswap and the UNI token. There is no need to drastically change the structure of the liquidity program, especially given the timing around incentives ending and the intent to start the next cycle as close to Nov 17th as possible. We recognize that parties feel strongly on increasing and decreasing incentives, and view this proposal as a happy medium to maintain the status quo in lieu of more detailed incentive programs in the near future. Benefits:  Ongoing incentives allows UNI to be distributed to those providing value in the form of liquidity The incentivized pools are likely to remain the most liquid DEX pair on Ethereum, providing a venue to trade against ETH at virtually any size with zero slippage. Reduced incentives prevent UNI from being distributed \u2018too fast\u2019, marked by all tokens being distributed before the Foundation\u2019s four year vesting has passed.  Drawbacks:  Ongoing incentives result in UNI largely being \u2018farmed and dumped\u2019 to earn yield. See ETH USD Yield Farm, Pickle, Harvest and Alpha. Reduced incentives means UNI is distributed slower. Incentivizing the same pools can be seen as choosing \u2018winners\u2019 by selecting WBTC as THE Bitcoin on Ethereum and favoring certain stablecoins over others.  Specifications: The specifications for this proposal should be updated in line with development support. We are currently looking for a party to lead the development of this proposal, and are open to researching different iterations of its implementation. General Requirements of Liquidity Mining include:  New distributor  Distribution to 4 covered pools (WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI) UNI distributed evenly per block over 60 days (or estimated block equivalent)  2.5 million UNI distributed to USDT/ETH and USDC/ETH pool, 1.25 million UNI per month per pool 3.33 million UNI distributed to WBTC/ETH pool, ~1.67 million UNI per month 1.67 million UNI distributed to DAI/ETH pool, ~0.83 million UNI per month   LPs receive UNI in proportion to liquidity provided   Uniswap proposal  Transfer 10 million UNI from governance treasury to distributor (possible) Autonomous proposal that is able to accept vote delegations   Community review / testing / auditing as appropriate  Potentially less review necessary if simple Mintr fork is used    We invite those interested in leading development to comment on the proposal below or to reach out on Twitter. This section will be updated with details of implementation when available. Proposed Timeline and Governance Process: We\u2019ll try to hew as closely as possible to the proposed governance process posted here. However, with the imminent ending of the first liquidity incentive program we feel that it will benefit the community to take action sooner rather than later. Given the timeframe around the incentives ending on November 17th, we\u2019ve decided to pull the following pieces: This timeline is tentative and subject to change 16 Nov 2020 -  Post plan overview document to Uniswap forum Begin temperature check process  Forum post  Snapshot poll - 3 day total duration, 25,000 UNI minimum quorum required to move forward    17 Nov 2020 -  Genesis liquidity incentive program ends  19 Nov 2020 -  Snapshot poll concludes for temperature check at 20:00 UTC  Final temperature check poll results    23 Nov 2020 -  Begin consensus check process  Forum post  Snapshot poll - 5 day total duration, 50,000 UNI minimum quorum required to move forward    28 Nov 2020 -  Snapshot poll concludes for consensus check  Poll passed with sufficient quorum    TBD -  Submit Uniswap proposal 3 for on chain UNI voting  10 million UNI required to submit proposal and begin vote Voting period lasts ~6 days and 4 hours (40,320 blocks) 40 million UNI required to meet quorum    7 days later -  Voting period ends If proposal passes, 2 day timelock before execution  2 days later -  Timelock period ends Proposal is executed New liquidity incentive program begins  60 days later -  New liquidity incentive program ends  Development goals timeline 17 Nov 2020 -  Solicit contribution from interested parties Request for comment on specification  20 Nov 2020 -  Finalize specifications Begin development work  27 Nov 2020 -  Target to complete development work and testing Deploy distributor contract Solicit community / professional feedback as appropriate  TBD -  Submit governance proposal  Future Developments: Governance would benefit from a more flexible distribution method for liquidity mining. Ideally, governance should be able to increase or reduce distribution speed, and change covered liquidity pools, without needing to deploy a new distributor contract each time. However, this would likely require substantially more development and review work. For this reason, we\u2019re proposing to use a simpler distribution mechanism for the new 2 month incentive program, which will give the community time to build consensus around a long term solution.

Gauntlet\u2019s analysis is one a lot of people are looking for, and one that should be used to inform the evolution of this proposal. Lots of concerns around ongoing rewards leading to negative token price. I agree with the likelihood and want to emphasize that we should look for improvements to these behaviors as well as other distribution mechanics (like developer grants) to help mitigate these types of actions.  There\u2019s a clear difference of opinions between speculators focused on token price, and those who see liquidity rewards as a means of distributing UNI to allow for more effective governance processes. I believe we will land somewhere in the middle, and am curious to see how the temperature check vote (now live) plays out. ",

Is there any rhyme or reason to this\u2026 or is it just a way to indicate a \u201cphasing out\u201d of some sort? It seems to me that all we know right now is that Uniswap won back a ton of liquidity with the current reward setup. We don\u2019t know what kind of effect removing rewards would cause, and we don\u2019t know what kind of effect halving them would cause either. Since the treasury gets 172m in Y1, is there really any harm in continuing the same 20m rewards we have for another 2 months, then use that time to make a more educated decision about how to proceed? Between phase 1 & phase 2 its still less than 25% of Y1 vesting. If we maintain what we have now, then between now and February we could have more calls & get far deeper on the issue than we can right now. ",

The early loyalty scheme is over, we are not going to just endlessly hand these tokens out. We need to come out with better incentives to add value to UNI over time. For example: We should give a discount on trading fees if you own and stake your tokens. There are LOTS of scum whales (I won\u2019t say their names) who come in, use their exchange tokens to farm, and auto-dump on everyone. I don\u2019t want those r*tards messing with our sweet pink unicorn  It is obvious that the community should wait and evaluate the effects of the pool ending, as well as wait for Uni V3. We should be allowing users to access better Uni V3 features if they have UNI token, or maybe stake it too. As others have mentioned, doing the whole Liquidity pool is trash. I already know of SCUM HEDGE FUNDS who set up \u201cRetailer Pools\u201d to farm the Uni LP and auto-dump every day to get yield. I will gladly buy their cheap UNI but I don\u2019t think you guys understand how much dumping this causes over time. In summary:  LP incentives are trash and we have moved pass it. NO MORE LP SCHEMES Reward stakers and long-term h0dlers Wait a bit of time and for Uni V3 to come out Consider giving access to more features if you own UNI and stake it. Cheaper fees, more features.  You want to use Uni, the biggest dex in the game? Okay, you buy the token, you commit to staking or owning it with-in your account, and you get access to the best features in the game. A fair trade-off. Liquidity Pools are Liquidity Poop  UNICORNS ARE COOL AND HERE TO STAY  ",

From what I understand (referring to OP\u2019s timeline), we are about to witness at least 2.5 weeks of no-incentive. And then, a proposal might emerge, on which we will get to vote. I think those 2 weeks (a long time in terms of DeFi, as we know) will probably help us decide on the next phase. ",

Thanks for the response. Feelings are great, but we are about to make a major decision regarding a $2 billion DeFi product. Major companies, organizations, entities, etc do not run on feelings. They run on data. Being a decentralized organization does not lift this burden from us. Business is business.  Where is the data? We are fully capable of gathering the necessary data. But we haven\u2019t yet (unless there is some research being done that I\u2019m not aware of). If we don\u2019t have the data, then there is no doubt that we should continue doing what is working right now until we have data that shows that a change will actually yield the intended outcome. Whether it\u2019s halving the reward, eliminating the reward, or doubling the reward - we should have strong evidence that it\u2019s going to work before we do it. ",

For anyone who hasn\u2019t listened to the recording of the first unofficial community call, I strongly recommend you to do that before coming to a decision on whether or not this is a good thing for the protocol. As mentioned in the call, some of the most important factors to the health and continued adoption of Uniswap is the reduction of slippage and the ease of use as far as Uniswap acting as an on-ramp/off-ramp between stablecoins and other tokens - these are good goals to have at this time. Whilst I agree that the liquidity mining program cannot continue indefinitely, I feel that in the absence of another proposal for developer grants or other programs that add value to Uniswap, continuation of the program for the time being in order to achieve the above goals is a good idea. I have a couple of questions:   First, I\u2019d like to echo Chris\u2019 sentiment - what was reasoning used when making the decision to cut the rewards in half?   Second, was any thought given to the idea of reducing the number of incentivized pools? A couple of people raised the idea of dropping down to a single stablecoin-ETH pool along with maintaining the wBTC-ETH pool for the time being during the call, and I\u2019m wondering what your thoughts were on this. If its indeed seen to be that the rate of distribution through this program is too high to be sustainable, could this be a reasonable alternative to cutting the per-pool rate in half?   Thanks again for taking the time to build such a comprehensive offering to the community! ",

There are few proven bad actors like Alameda Research who were shorting and market dumping UNI, these whales are moving billions of dollars in a matter of few transactions from Uniswap to Sushiswap and back. The additional 2 months won\u2019t solve anything, this program doesn\u2019t permanently solve the liquidity problem, but only helps whales to manipulate and short the market. Instead, as already discussed in various topics in this forum, I think it\u2019s better to fund UNI pools (UNI/USDC, UNI/ETH etc) to motivate liquidity providers to actually hold and add more UNIs to pools, this will also help for distribution because traders will be able to buy UNI with a lower slippage.

But, there is something important we need to keep in mind here: it is good for the UNI distribution to continue, because we need more UNI out there, which could be used for voting.

Second, it create a long term sustainable solution and not a solution that UNI holders pay for 2 month and then the liquidity drops and we have to pay for another 2 month. When UNI token is distributed initially there is 251,534 user addresses, now I believe there is more due to the initial launch also advertise the protocol.

But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that, if UNI was to subsidize a UNI-ETH LP with a factor of 1X (and not 10X+ as seen in degen farming schemes), UNI would become a ponzi. Anyway, as we\u2019ve said before, UNI-ETH incentivizing isn\u2019t very possible at this state because  We already have a problem getting votes/quorum Incentivizing UNI-ETH LP would make this problem way worse, because a lot more UNI wouldn\u2019t be able to vote (probably millions more)  A first step would be to propose a way to make LPed UNIs\u2019 vote count. This is a good idea in any case (UNI-ETH incentives or not), because currently a lot of UNI is barred from voting (more than 8 millions as I\u2019m typing this !) The issue here is that this is a non-trivial upgrade that will need fresh code and fresh auditing (so, probably treasury funding). This is well out of the scope of the proposal we are discussing. What we are proposing here is merely a way to extend incentives for a while, and during the second incentives era, governance will be able to come up with truly novel ideas. ",

They, as holders of the asset, feel dissatisfied when UNI price goes down. There is one thing to consider, though: When UNI price gets lower due to ongoing process of distribution, it is a healthy process that is beneficial for Uniswap governance. When LPs receive UNI rewards by providing value to the network, they can keep or sell them. Distributing UNI rewards to LPs who keep them and become part of the governance process is a positive result. LPs who sell the tokens self-retire themselves from Uniswap governance. By doing so, they also bring the price down. When the price is lower, it creates a better buying opportunity for people who believe in Uniswap\u2019s future. So present and future investors in the protocol benefit. The same logic applies to past users who received the airdrop. The power in the network gets decentralized and distributed towards good actors. ",

If we\u2019re concerned about bad actors gaming the system to their advantage, using incentivized UNI pools will only make this 10x worse. To further iterate my thoughts here, this more about maintaining an ongoing distribution of UNI, giving the community more tokens to work with and a more accurate market valuation. Assuming governance is going to scale and evolve, its important for the supply to be democratized for effective governance. I\u2019d also like to emphasize that I\u2019m well aware of strategies farming UNI to dump, and would view this next phase as a bridge to find a stronger program around rewards that may include vesting, whitelists or something in between.

If a competitor offers twice that APY by way of subsidizing, well, liquidity providers will more or less slowly flock in that direction. It\u2019s the way things work in a market. So Uniswap is better off subsidizing a bit than not subsidizing at all. Why ? Because with decentralized governance, we move much more slowly (as we can see right now), than say, competition that have a \u201cChef\u201d approach (centralized, rotating, planned subsidies). Again, 50% subsidies feels like a good compromise right now. It feels more sustainable. We should have had this whole discussion way earlier. It will be exciting, in the future, to come up with changes to the pairs and other new tokenomics stuff. But right now, we are a bit in a rush even though, as we\u2019ve seen, no incentives is not catastrophic. PS : yes, I\u2019m aware that APY could be lower than it is today under the first incentives era on the subsidized pairs. ",

                    "content": "To summarize a lot of what has been said previously\u2026 There is a perceived need for UNI subsidies (LP rewarded with UNI) to stop a very real hemorrhage of the total value locked in Uniswap (from DEFI Pulse). This stated need has been resisted by some who hold the view that TVL is not as important as the volume of trades taking place on unicorn swapperino. There has been no data presented (in this forum post) about how trading volume has reacted to the lack of incentives in the liquidity pools; I think because it doesn\u2019t exist at the moment/ people are waiting for gauntlet\u2019s data, which according to @allo will show if it\u2019s worth keeping/reducing incentives. Some people have also brought up the separate issue that the UNI in liquidity pools would have to be removed from those pools in order to vote on these proposals. Please direct some of your attention to that: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/allow-uni-tokens-locked-in-pools-to-vote/5559/11. To me this problem seems like one to solve quickly whether one supports this proposal about the LP rewards/incentives or not. To draw a conclusion: I hope that the gauntlet data provides clarity on whether LP rewards are necessary to sustain UNI as a DEX, and I feel as though the TVL drop is not more than an indication of a potential problem, the potential problem being a potential semipermanent drop in trading volume. Additionally, while we wait for November 23rd to roll around please direct attention to the above link. To me, it seems like a complete failure of our decentralized democratic governance system that needs to be addressed. P.S. It should be known that I\u2019m new to DeFi and could be completely wrong in every way . I have done my best to do my due diligence and research. If you think I\u2019ve overlooked something please do me the favor of responding or at the least messaging me. ",

                    "content": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA256 The simplest, most equitable criteria for liquidity incentives is that the same amount of money is paid per $1M of liquidity in each rewarded pool. There are a number of ways to measure this, whether it be via the relative amounts of slippage or impermanent loss or strictly by the amount of UNI paid out in dollar terms for liquidity. The latter term is more intuitive and will be easier to consider for a heuristic Snapshot vote, while the former is more accurate but requires more data processing and cleaning. For this vote, I suggest we use the latter and do the following:  Consider the entire UNI budget spent right now (54 UNI/block, since right now we have 13.5 UNI / block / pool) and divide it by 2 (27 UNI / block) Note that USDT, USDC tended to stay near 25% of the budget spent (which meets our criteria), so their relative fraction should be unchanged (6.75 UNI / block) For the latter two pools, note that the ratio of the Dai cost to WBTC cost averaged 1.76x with a standard deviation of 0.38. We can roughly say that if we compensate WBTC 2x what the Dai pool receives, then we should equilibrate to having Dai / WBTC have the same cost, so we give WBTC 9 UNI / block and DAI 4.5 UNI block -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  iQIzBAEBCAAdFiEEEJAuhmVduSEVN8uPKIPJySxksQ8FAl+5cvkACgkQKIPJySxk sQ9UthAAmWYTMONKAdmmMQ34PzNbjbAvdzysM7suMkbkg0cv5RS6n4ICaVoeU8Sq N5+FYWr05aR3Odp3JS+VrGptnKZsnupx+89+7nCOuvKNjREq4thV38gilnK6izXz SNVDnqccTqiCACI2IQOnjW+b6JhblYZa6f+JoFjr6s5ml/4GiAS8rZ9yDyMiN9jh neBBPYizTdk5u60/LTT+g1h2lELw5BMe6T4ohYz39i92lu67MXru+ul91FXjG3ji /cr7raDdTi5C/IO56AdT9JANBWLzjEoQ/E1UR4NKPg4OJ7UJwOviN0Z+MZOfiKN/ 6S5svBPmznBRhV34vqrTpHCVaFqhP9Br6+/H9ZFiZWbMGFORf8D26bUxLlHxCqXa wO5jP2ThWVXzSOMKxZUSrPrJbQWE82djSLGQ2+Lsn/Iwbp6mpx2qK6T37IATIfyE JdiSs4Ppwhp7H4xpBQoawQztMhP3eTUY68jkGC58zX1csCWzF1n2lsnRRnk4mLo5 /DpqWoMrxjJrt46ARzTOrsDsGx2tSEomWf8Nsci7btEpZDT5KwIufA+v+O+7+FMR /hNvFLVm+Mpe2FbLnpY6zcgXXhhjRrS5Gba5oxTe25cndNU3J3dNKcMuZVbf3I1G cO6KDblXQwyheWm6tY3gds6OG7RtCBFsnkiC62LedPdKWULSDgU= =axi/ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  ",

As a lp I need enough trading volume to justify the risk of impermanent loss (also superior on uni). If we are seeing higher trading volume in relation to liquidity volume at competitors or if we see a drain in pools, these would be the criteria for me to think about new incentives. edit: also if liqudity fell so much that slipage for the most traded pairs increase for the avarege trade size would be a reason for incentive, haven\u2019t figured out the numbers, but this is ofc something worth to look at to me.

This would end up increasing the disparity in liquidity between the pools. As it is a change to the status quo, I believe it needs more justification.     tarun:  The simplest, most equitable criteria for liquidity incentives is that the same amount of money is paid per $1M of liquidity in each rewarded pool.   This criterion doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. There are diminishing returns on every new $1M of liquidity. $1M worth of liquidity in a $50M pool is much more valuable than $1M worth of liquidity in a $900M pool. However, if we find the diminishing returns criterion as the most crucial, we shouldn\u2019t continue the liquidity mining program for the proposed pools. And start rewarding other pairs instead. I believe there should also be a criterion in place that we use to measure overincentivization . For example, spending all the treasury money on the WBTC-ETH pair doesn\u2019t look right, even if it would bring larger liquidity to the platform. Maybe we could explore the correlation of Volume and Liquidity among the pairs? In my opinion, if we have an inverse correlation between Liquidity and Volume, it is a clear sign that the pair is heavily overincentivized. And WBTC-ETH pair is the most overincentivized pair in the initial program. == There was a question in the survey about restructuring the existing pools based on APYs, and here\u2019s no clear preference there:  == We could state that we want to reward the Bitcoin community with the same APY we reward the other top-4 pools. Or that we want to bring more whale trading on WBTC on Uniswap. But that would be political statements. I can\u2019t detect a valid quantitative argument yet, though. If we think about the slippage, the slippage below <0.01% is not even displayed in the UI. And 0.01% slippage already looks quite negligible given the fact that users pay 0.3% fee on top of it. ",

We can also make a further distinction: BTC, centralized stablecoins, decentralized stablecoin. There might be a case to be made to include only one centralized stablecoin in the program. The justification for this change would be strategic and ecosystem-related. It seems beneficial for DeFi ecosystem on Ethereum if DAI and WBTC grow adoption. That said, when it comes to paying for ecosystem development, I think Sushiswap is already doing it just fine.

For the HIGH risk of impermanent loss, we are underincentivized, even on WBTC Pools.   The IL on WBTC-ETH pair is lower than on USD-ETH pairs, because ETH+BTC moves in USD terms are correlated. The lower IL on WBTC-ETH pair also explains why it had bigger liquidity while being a less profitable pair in terms of UNI distribution APYs. Meaning: LPs really don\u2019t need any noticeable APY from volume fees on this pair as long as they get UNI distribution that gives them 10% APY. If we take a look at it in isolation, the current 10% APY on WBTC-ETH pair could be viewed as LPs bet that most of the times ETH won\u2019t rise above 2.5x+ or fall below -60% compared to BTC. It is more complicated than that, but the general concept is there. The statement that you make - that even the most overincentivized (comparatively) pool is underincentivized, implies that the economic design of Uniswap is not sustainable. I don\u2019t think this statement has a solid foundation.     rezwile:  b. BTC and ETH are traded everywhere, much more than those nonsense tokens. The demand to trade is simply higher.

Over the course of this last distribution, DAI liquidity increased a lot less than liquidity in the other pools - this leads me to believe that DAI/ETH liquidity is less responsive to incentives, and Uniswap gains a bit less from incentivizing DAI/ETH equally with the other pools. WBTC is the only candidate for incentivized BTC liquidity, and attributing 1/3 of the program rewards to it with 2/3 to USD stablecoins (1/4 USDC, 1/4 USDT, 1/6 DAI) seems reasonable from a business standpoint. Over time, as other BTC implementations get more established, Uniswap may be able to diversify BTC incentives as well. As for USD stablecoins, each of the current options offers something different and I support maintaining all 3 as part of the incentive scheme. USDC is trusted and well regulated, USDT is the most widely used stablecoin, and DAI offers decentralization. ",

Here\u2019s some numbers to consider: Liquidity Volume ratios770\u00d7501 30.8 KB  The way I see it, both the liquidity programs Uniswap LPs enjoyed are quite successful overall. The main achievement of the UNI liquidity mining program (LMP) is that it brought DAI and WBTC on par with the other two of the top-4 pairs on the exchange. However, it appears that there\u2019s not much room to grow from here, especially with 50% of the incentives. If we consider liquidity before and after UNI LMP (see \u201c4 difference with 2\u201d column), it signals that rewarding USDC and USDT was less beneficial in comparison to rewarding WBTC and DAI. The volume\u2019s retention rate is quite impressive post LMP, but it looks like the volume is close to its cap at this point in time. So additional subsidies are unlikely to be efficient for the most part (see: \u201c3 difference with 2\u201d). As for liquidity, as you can see in the \u201cDifference with 3\u201d column, WBTC and USDC have lower liquidity retention rates than the other two pairs so far. It could signal that a bigger percentage of money in these pairs stayed there temporarily to enjoy the farming incentives. == I think it makes sense to bring the discussion more to the quantitative realm, so we can figure out how good this decision is from the business perspective. It seems that there are some models to explore to guesstimate what we\u2019re trying to achieve with the program - and what efficiency we expect. Of course, even if all the metrics say that the continuation of LMP is inefficient as a business proposal, it doesn\u2019t mean that the community shouldn\u2019t accept it due to other reasons. Some of the possible reasons to continue distribution are:  enough self-rewarding interest in the community, i.e. there are enough UNI holders who want to participate in LMP and rip the benefits of it. If we view LMP from the self-interest perspective, the current proposal seems like a good middle-ground between the part of the community that wants to mine and the part that doesn\u2019t. the distribution argument I\u2019ve stated above other strategic considerations, some of which are more quantifiable, some are less.

I suggest considering two queries for that that reflect 50th and 95th Percentiles of Trades over time: 50th percentile1343\u00d7479 56.6 KB As we can see from the 50th Percentile query, the increased liquidity hasn\u2019t raised the average trade size during LMP. 95th percentile1340\u00d7474 58.5 KB The 95th Percentile query is a bit more differentiating. We can see that WBTC liquidity is better utilized by large traders. Among the USD pairs DAI showed the best utilization rate, USDT the worst, but they\u2019re close overall. USD numbers start to make more sense if we take a look at the volumes of respective pairs compared to the leader / 2nd best option on the market (data from Coinmarketcap):  If we want to optimize the distributions to reduce the slippage for large traders, it makes sense to bring more weight to the WBTC pool. If we think about competition, it is not clear if the program is needed at this point in time. Uniswap either has dominance or no chance for dominance when it comes to volume share in the market for the respective pairs. ",

This same metric can be helpful in the future when we decide to incentivize other pools.  Out of all the pools DAI is the second largest community of LPs after UNI. And out of all incentivized pools WBTC has the least amount of members. So if we want to decentralize the distribution, taking away from DAI and giving it to WBTC does the opposite of what we want. It is a deal-breaker for me for the modified proposal. Cutting the rewards from the bigger community and giving them to the smaller just makes no sense to me, and reduced slippage for large traders doesn\u2019t justify it in my mind. I\u2019m not convinced that Sushiswap presents a threat to Uniswap because Uniswap is simply richer, has an all-star development team, and a large user base. I think it\u2019s good for the DeFi ecosystem that Sushiswap subsidizes liquidity and we should let it do that. I don\u2019t think there is a reason to compete. At any given moment, Uniswap can get the dominant position in any Sushi market it wants. ",

Initially, the proposal seemed like a good idea to me, as I thought it represented the middle ground between the interests of different parts of the Uniswap Community. I have reconsidered my stance since. Now it seems to me that there\u2019s not much to gain here for all the major groups: LPs, Users, UNI holders. It also doesn\u2019t look like a good investment in isolation. The targeted markets are the ones where Uniswap either already has dominance or has no chance for dominance. The program is likely to be inefficient in its primary purposes. The increase in the liquidity retention effect is expected to be considerably lower than after the previous two programs. We also know that increased liquidity doesn\u2019t increase the volume or the average trade size, so excessive liquidity is not needed. As for the community-building perspective, for the most part, we just invite LPs who left to come back temporarily. The improvements to the user experience will be quite negligible and not worth the cost. If my estimations are correct, more than 87% of the trades on top-4 pairs happen with a <0.01% slippage already. For reference, the UI doesn\u2019t show if the slippage is 0.001% or 0.009%. Current liquidity providers on the top-4 pairs don\u2019t get much from this program either: their APYs are likely to stay the same. Except they\u2019re rewarded in respective coins now, and with the program, they\u2019ll receive UNI instead. The primary beneficiaries of this program are large LPs who left Uniswap after the program finished. UNI holders pay for this program, and it sounds like a bad investment. Sushiswap is not a competitor to Uniswap on these pairs, and the numbers there are not sustainable and likely have signaling purposes. I also find it a bit questionable to view the restart of the initial program as maintaining the status quo. If someone proposed to repeat the original airdrop with a smaller size, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be viewed as such. I will vote against the proposal. I think the modified version leads to less decentralized distribution than the original, but I would vote against the original version too. Even though I\u2019m pro-distribution overall, and I think it\u2019s ok if a distribution is somewhat inefficient, the inefficiency of this one is a bit too high for my taste. We can do better, and nothing is pressing us to restart the liquidity incentives immediately. ",

                    "content": "I recommend listening to the 2nd Uniswap community call to everyone who missed it. There\u2019s some quality discussion there. After hearing additional arguments, I\u2019d like to adjust my stance. I acknowledge that there is a strategic value to incentivizing the WBTC pool in the near future. Addressing my previous arguments:   The market leadership argument is not entirely correct. Uniswap is the leader in volume on WBTC/ETH pair, but it\u2019s far away from leadership on BTC/ETH pair, of course - and this is a top-3 market in crypto space.   In terms of slippage on large trades, WBTC is the only pool that it makes sense to incentivize comparatively:    0,01% slippage seems like a good target to strive for. As WBTC traders utilize the liquidity more in terms of trade sizes, additional incentivization would bring the experience on par with top USD pairs.  WBTC has the smallest number of makers and takers among the top-4 pairs.  This fact doesn\u2019t imply the direction of incentivization, though. Do we want to reward a pair with more makers and takers to decentralize the distribution? Or a pair with fewer makers and takers in hopes that the number grows?  WBTC-ETH pair is indeed the most responsive to liquidity incentives, likely due to the lower volatility.  Even though the retention of liquidity after the program is only 31%, the growth in Liquidity/Volume ratio compared to the period before the program is still quite substantial: Liquidity_Volume growth573\u00d7501 16.8 KB Another notable pair in this table is DAI. As we can see, DAI gained the most out of the UNI program in terms of Liquidity/Volume ratio growth. How we interpret these results is up to us. In my opinion, the key difference between Sushi and UNI programs is that the first one incentivized a lot of pools, and the latter only 4. Being one of the top four pools brought a lot of legitimacy to DAI and WBTC, which had positive feedback loops regarding LPs\u2019 comfort to park their money. The least successful pair in terms of gaining retention effects from the program is USDC.  The money that will go to the WBTC-ETH pool will likely stay there only temporarily for the program\u2019s duration. And the large portion of the distribution will likely be received by large funds.  It then comes down to the decision we need to make - how strategically important it is for us to have big liquidity on the BTC pair. If we find it crucial, we can opt to renew WBTC incentives repeatedly and keep that temporary liquidity. == The reasoning above would make me vote for the proposal that would incentivize only the WBTC pair. There is no significant drawback on USD pairs in trading experience, they perform well without the program, and Uniswap doesn\u2019t have a new niche to take with them. So I would vote against restarting LMP for them. If I were to modify the initial proposal, I would take an even amount out of all USD pairs, not just DAI. DAI pair in the initial program invited a bigger number of new LPs to Uniswap - and was a quite successful investment in general. Overall it makes me neutral, so I will actively abstain from voting. I believe both outcomes have their own merits and drawbacks, and I approve of both of them. ",

Spending another 10 million UNI (=$40 million) from the treasury should be done with more supporting data, strategically, and with an eye towards long-term growth. Consider how much money that is, and what it could potentially be used for to create sustainable NFX around Uniswap. The due diligence a regular company of Uniswap\u2019s valuation would do before spending $40 million in stock options is on a complete different level from what is happening here. This should give people pause. The first important issue is that liquidity mining does not create a sustainable NFX for protocols. This is shown by how liquidity immediately migrates away immediately when the incentives end. Playing an endless game of distributing tokens and fighting with competitors that way, is fundamentally a losing proposition. Liquidity mining seems to have zero effect on creating a DEX people will want to use. If you take a look at Uniswap\u2019s market share among DEXs, it has not taken a hit since the liquidity mining ended. image925\u00d7392 57.8 KB Second, it\u2019s likely that the incentive should be distributed more uniformly across many pairs. We should try to pick out pools based on the demand, and have data that supports that in what pairs traders are experiencing slippage. This is roughly approximated by the following chart. There\u2019s no reason to anchor ourselves to these 4 pairs. image1666\u00d7722 106 KB Overall, the Uniswap treasury should be spent with tremendous care. This is a multi-decade race, and we don\u2019t want to use all our ammo in the 1st inning (to draw liquidity that immediately leaves without those incentives). ",

This is governance in action, and I\u2019m super optimistic for Uniswap\u2019s future based on this discussion  With regards to continuing distribution, I believe Uniswap stands to benefit even if incentives are not fully optimized. Issuance gives potential Uniswap community members a chance to buy or earn (through being an LP) their share of governance at a reasonable cost - giving community members upside potential has proven important to other crypto project\u2019s success. I also think @mosayeri made a great point in yesterday\u2019s community call that deep liquidity in some of these foundational pairs like ETH/BTC can help bring in new users from the CEX space and expand Uniswap\u2019s total addressable market. Clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2FC1GN-U_I&feature=youtu.be&t=1036 I\u2019m a little concerned that volume may be a lagging indicator of DEX adoption, and allowing Uniswap\u2019s share of TVL/Liquidity to decline could cause increasing impact on trade volume market share over time. The drop off in market share has not been as bad as feared so far, but I don\u2019t take too much comfort from this with only a week of data. ",

I appreciated hearing new participants in this second call and found the ambiance/atmosphere/tone was better, which is normal. I am not yet decided on the vote. As many here (and in the call, @mikedemarais  and @internal123456 ) have already pointed out, it\u2019s a very big expense and the effects seem to be limited. At the same time, our competition has the advantage of moving faster and a little defense probably wouldn\u2019t hurt. Ideally, I think something like 1/4th or at most 1/3th of the budget (vs the first LM era) would be enough, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019ll be voting on (we\u2019ll be voting on distributing 50%). In conclusion, it appears to me that we should start considering other ways of distributing UNI. As it was pointed out toward the end of the call, liquidity mining (LM) programs are often targeted by big funds. Thus we end up distributing a lot of UNI to the already rich. Liquidity mining also forgets the other part of the equation, and that is actual volume. I.e. liquidity mining incentivizes primarily TVL but not the other ingredient or metric of success that is volume. Hence we could start thinking about ways to incentivize swapping by simply distributing UNI to those who drive the volume, aka Uniswap swappers ! I think that would be pretty crazy and be one way to distribute fairly. It would also be great publicity for our beloved platform, another publicity stunt if you will . (P.S. Speaking of competition, and as a heads up to the community, Andre Cronje is about to release Deriswap. It remains to be seen if it\u2019s going to be a direct competitor to Uniswap. What he did say in an interview yesterday is that Deriswap is essentially 150 lines of code on top of Uniswap. So, IMO, it could be a fork, or it could plug-in into Uniswap and use its liquidities, kind of like what AlphaHomora is doing. We will know very soon in any case.) ",

                    "content": "Thank you Monet! I wanted to echo what I previously brought up on the community call; I think deep bitcoin liquidity is very important for Uniswap\u2019s growth. I believe that the DeFi summer, including Uniswap\u2019s own liquidity incentive program combined with the current market conditions has created a very unique and valuable growth opportunity for Uniswap. This is an opportunity to attract new types of users in large numbers to the protocol and the greater DeFi ecosystem. The goal of most liquidity incentive programs is to attract new users by making the app more useful (or useful to more people). So far, the UNI program has been very successful at achieving this goal, evident by the amount of new capital that has flown into the space in the past two months. My argument is that this window of opportunity to attract new users to Uniswap has only just opened and we\u2019ve yet to see the delayed user acquisition response to the liquidity program. I sense a growing interest in Uniswap as a trading venue outside of the traditional DeFi demographic and this interest hasn\u2019t yet fully translated to active users; infrastructural delay being only one reason. Creating liquidity depth has an inherent causality dilemma that is most conveniently resolved by liquidity injection via incentives but, due to the tech barrier between Web 3.0 and the rest of the market, the effects won\u2019t always immediately translate. It\u2019s important to note that significant reduction in liquidity will certainly erode this momentum, thus governance should take action. It\u2019s fallacious to assume that the current state will remain as status quo if no further action is taken. If there were to be a sense of urgency in returning the incentive program then, the importance of not losing this growth momentum should certainly be a major consideration. Our goal should be to grow Uniswap and we should be cognizant that growing outside the current DeFi user demographic will have an increasing reliance on bitcoin liquidity. ",

Listening to the community call, and reading the threads, it appears that the rough consensus is that the first \u201cSuccess Criteria\u201d that is most important at this time is reducing slippage on the top trading pairs. Based on @Mr_Po\u2019s post above, 28% of WBTC trading have greater than 0.01% slippage which is far worse than USDT(7.5%), Dai(14%), and USDC(14%). Looking at the current slippage curve for each pair, it appears that bringing the slippage down for WBTC, Dai, and USDC pairs to parity with USDT might be a good first milestone to improve Uniswap\u2019s product for whale traders. However, I don\u2019t think we should be in a rush and recommend waiting a month or two to analyze the market and make sure we are making a well informed data driven decision on the size of the next liquidity mining program.

We 1) provide liquidity, 2) the capital remains in the \u201ctreasury,\u201d and 3) shareholder dilution is basically the same as it would be under the current proposal (we should assume all the 10m UNI will be sold). It\u2019s not hundreds of millions, yes, but that liquidity would actually stay there until governance decides otherwise. Unlike under a liquidity incentives program. Sure there\u2019s plenty of other great ideas for a spare $32,000,000. ",

This idea becomes even more appealing when you think about the APY it can provide for the treasury. The disadvantage here is that you are competing with your very own LPs.

The thing is, they might end up retaining LPs even after the subsidies stop ! The data shows that COMP and UMA (both low volume pairs) at least today have better liq and better volume at Sushi. For AAVE and SNX (higher volume than COMP and UMA), Sushi has better liquidity but it doesn\u2019t have (yet ?) better volume. For AAVE and SNX we can say network effects are working in Uniswap\u2019s favor. (It could also have to do with Uniswap stables liquidity as a lot of people swap from token to stables) I hate to be the alarmist guy, so please draw your own conclusions here. I don\u2019t know if Sushi can afford to print tokens at the same pace, but keep in mind Sushi friends could be artificially supporting Sushi token price right now (and thus Sushi LP APY) by market buying regularly.

Whenever we can use this power by passing a proposal to make some changes, even it\u2019s not a perfect one, it will still be a strong positive message to the market to say that UNI works, Uniswap community governance works. To be honest, I was quite upset about the chaos of the community governance process. Even tried to use some radical ways to push it ahead. After dive deep in the governance process, I know that I should have more patience and respect, especially to those who truly working hard to make contributions to the whole community.

That being said, I\u2019m still unsure of what I should vote. On one side, many DEXes are trying to dethrone Uniswap at the same time. One of DeFi\u2019s biggest innovator, Andre Cronje (yEarn fame) just (today) teamed up with Sushiswap to compete with Uni and bring the forked Uniswap V2 code  to another level (introduce options, etc.) On the other side, Uni has networks effects playing in its favor and doesn\u2019t seem to be immediately in danger. (Also, it pays LPs 0.3% instead of 0.25% for Sushi, which turned on its fee switch) In my view, we should start incentivizing end users (client-side mining, find a way to incentivize swap). It would be less costly than liquidity mining and have good distribution effects. It could be run in parallel to the LM campaign. We are all waiting for V3 to land and during that time, I think it\u2019s best to play it safe. Now, I would have reduced the budget of the second LM campaign to something like a third of what it was, not half\u2026 but that\u2019s what we get to vote on. ",

He failed at both. Actually, if the APY is better for LPs now that the campaign has stopped, maybe miners actually cared about holding some of the UNI they mined. Otherwise, it\u2019s hard to explain how they would favor lower APY. BTW I don\u2019t find the UNI-ETH LP incentives idea to be as appealing as it once was. Uni is already just below DAI in terms of liquidity, so no real problem there in my view. It could be a double edged sword : we lose voting power and there is more liquidity for whales to dump. If the liquidity doubles overnight, it also kind of becomes harder to move the price, which could either be good or bad. As I said, it\u2019s a tough decision. I\u2019d really like it if the team could enlighten us a bit more on the roadmap. I think it\u2019s coming soon in any event. They said \u00ab in the coming months \u00bb in August, so it can\u2019t be that far. In any event, I believe V3 will make Sushiswap and other DEXes obsolete for a while. ",

Instead of moving proposals like this, we should figure out a new way of voting. It is an issue. I can make a temp check poll for my proposal, vote for it, it will pass the 50k threshold and say Im sorry guys, the community has spoken! The temperature check has passed!

                    "content": "In light of Uniswap\u2019s liquidity mining program, here\u2019s some research on how centralized exchanges incentivize liquidity. Granted CEXs tend to have central order limit books (CLOBs) rather than an AMM design, so the mapping isn\u2019t perfect. Here is the write-up, with the highlights below: In a simplified exchange model, they compete for liquidity - each one wants deeper order books and tighter spreads to get more volume. No one wants to trade on an exchange with lots of slippage. It turns out you can modify the fee model to incentivize particular behavior. Most exchanges today use a \u201cmaker-taker\u201d model, where the taker of liquidity (market orders) pays the maker of liquidity (the limit order creator). Ex: taking a share off the exchange costs 0.3 cents and the trader who added that share gets 0.25 cents as cashback. This incentivizes traders to put a lot of limit orders on exchanges instead of market orders. In a sense, Uniswap is the epitome of a maker-taker exchange as currently, all the 30 bps fee goes to the liquidity provider. This contrasts significantly with CLOB DEXs, who give meager < 2 bps rebates to market makers. We know that increasing rebates (via liquidity mining) will increase total liquidity, but the lower slippage did not lead to a meaningful increase in volume. Therefore the total fees (ignoring UNI bonus) to LPs per dollar went down. This dynamic makes rebates complicated for AMMs. If fees/rebate increases by 50% and pool size doubles, but volumes are flat - the rebate per dollar goes down. Knowing this, new LPs will always be wary of deploying capital b/c their yield will vary. Therefore whenever there is a rebate increase, there has to be a push to also increase volumes, potentially through payment for order flow (PFOF) - but more on this later. ",

Holding UNI should be a growth investment, and done in conjunction with providing liquidity. If you are just HODLing UNI market bought, never providing liquidity in other key pairs, and making your game plan that no new UNI is ever issued and you can just take that 0.05% that seems like the completely wrong approach. This early in the stage protocol inflation is necessary to capture and retain market share. You can provide liquidity in the incentivized pools to keep your UNI % of the network strong. But having zero UNI emissions will kill this protocol and make the 0.05% meaningless. If you want buy backs and dividends and no growth just buy a cigarette stock like MO or PM. If UNI hodlers want an inflation shield we should subsidize an UNI/ETH pool. This is how every other farm does it. I know some at UNI like to think we are \u2018better\u2019 than \u2018degen\u2019 farms but ignoring the basic principle of subsidizing liquidity in the inflated coin is a massive mistake and is part of what is creating this rift in the community leading to zero emissions.

If the liquidity mining program compensates exactly the amount that is being taken away by the fee switch, nothing changes for LPs in terms of APY. In this case what changes is the composition of the Community treasury: it accumulates USD, ETH, and BTC without the need to sell UNI. In other words, it exchanges UNI from the treasury for these coins at better rates than the market. The rates are better because a lot of LPs will keep the UNI they get, especially if the APY they get from UNI is low. Having these coins in the treasury would be beneficial to pay for services and grants.

I love the discussions we\u2019ve had here, but I\u2019m concerned that we are still debating and not voting. During this time, I\u2019m both happy and surprised Sushi didn\u2019t steal more volume. At this point (1 month after the start of this thread) my expectations with regards to governance have dropped sharply and I\u2019m kind of just hoping that V3 comes fast enough. It looks like big delegates have mostly abandoned us here. I know Compound governance has existed for a bit longer and deals with different matters, but to give you a point of comparison, they have voted on 4 proposals (3 of them passed) while we were discussing here\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s not the best metric, maybe there are problems (I\u2019m not familiar w/ Compoun gov.), but still.

Had the vote gone through immediately, we would have never learned what you pointed out to: Users didn\u2019t follow liquidity. And this is a key lesson for the entire project and for the dex space at large. Sushiswap is currently burning its tokens away in order to attract LPs. Good. What good are LPs without users? Plus it\u2019s safe to assume that the majority of LPs will come back to Uniswap as soon as Sushis won\u2019t be distributed anymore. We still have enough liquidity to operate, we still have most of the users, why would we even want to spend UNIs here? It wouldn\u2019t bring the protocol much, it would be very expensive, it would contribute to centralizing governance in the hands of the LPs, and it would take away bullets that could be used later, in case they are actually needed at some point. LP incentives take away from other incentive programs we might decide to put in place in the future. I would love to see the delay last longer tbh. ",

I\u2019ve pinged them many times on Discord and here, and they keep quiet. In the meantime, we are losing liquidity, but volume doesn\u2019t follow that much. Sushiswap has to use subsidies all the time, pretty much on every pair since they have the fee switch turned on (LPs get less by default). Uniswap is still the default DEX for most new coins.

Sushiswap will certainly survive, it will probably grow, but it doesn\u2019t look like it will become the #1 dex anytime soon. Without incentives, Sushiswap cannot really compete with V2 yet. And even with incentives, I doubt it will be able to compete with V3. What I\u2019m curious about is the way the team will make V3 hard to copy. I\u2019m sure they will somehow manage to do it even if it means additional delays. Still a good choice. Setting up optimistic rollups (if any) will certainly be harder than copying V2, but my guess is that there\u2019ll be more than that. I can\u2019t wait! ",

They feared that the community (and LPs) would vote for reactivating LP rewards, and they feared that the LPs gain too much power so early. These rewards would only lead to more LP rewards, more power for LPs, more LP rewards, more power for LPs. They realized that this a threat to the protocol, and and an extremely serious one. So they decided to slow down the setting of this vote, which is weird, but works. My guess is that in order for V3 to make as much noise as possible and to maximize decentralization, it will include user incentivization at launch. This would be a fantastic marketing tactic, and would allow to gain crazy market shares not only from all dexes but also from cexes as well. Extremely rapidly Amazing launch + excellent decentralization = fantastic plan. Then only can the governance be fully put in the hands of the community, which was the initial plan. ",

                    "content": "Hi everyone! Sincere apologies for being out of touch for so long. I\u2019ve been very busy with my day jobs over the past couple months and haven\u2019t been able to give UNI governance the attention it deserves. I wanted to update everyone on the status of this proposal. TL;DR: I no longer believe it is in Uniswap\u2019s best interest to extend liquidity incentives, and will not be pushing this proposal forward to an on chain vote. Quick explanation of my reasoning: Liquidity incentives are not necessary right now When @coopahtroopa and I initially drafted this proposal, the liquidity incentives were ending imminently and it was not clear if Uniswap would be able to maintain its market share and dominance without continued token distribution. In my opinion, the relative performance of Uniswap vs competitors in the following few months has soundly addressed this concern. Uniswap continues to lead other DEXes in both TVL and trading volume, and in particular dominates trading in newly launched and long tail assets (basically anything that is not being actively incentivized by competitors). The scope and targeting of the proposed liquidity incentives no longer make sense Back in November, UNI was languishing below $4. Since then it has increased in value more than 5x, so the amounts listed in this proposal are likely no longer appropriate, even if UNI governance decided they would still like to move forward with liquidity incentives. Furthermore, the relative allocations proposed for WBTC, USDT, USDC, and DAI were based on a point-in-time analysis of the \u201cstickiness\u201d of LPs and trading volume. Given how liquidity has changed since then, the allocations no longer make sense. Liquidity incentives probably won\u2019t drive long term value In hindsight I view the September-November 2020 liquidity incentive program as a success - it helped Uniswap retain the top spot among DEX protocols and expanded ownership to the wider community. But in cases where we\u2019re not facing an existential threat, liquidity mining seems less valuable. Liquidity has no loyalty, and competitors such as Sushiswap are paying far more in incentives than they take in protocol fees. Over the long term, these incentives are clearly unsustainable and liquidity will likely migrate back to Uniswap once they are discontinued (assuming that Uniswap keeps the fee switch turned off). So what now? I believe we should refocus Uniswap governance and community efforts in areas that are likely to drive long term value and enduring network effects. Off the top of my head this could include community efforts on:  Improving Uniswap routing  Certain protocols such as Mirror, Frax, and Badger are heavily integrated with Uniswap, but benefit less than they should because key tokens are not included as \u201cbridge\u201d assets for routing purposes If we add support for trades through UST, FRAX, and WBTC, we could potentially deepen these protocols\u2019 relationship with Uniswap   SOCKS migration proposal  Uni governance owns the original SOCKS/ETH liquidity pool tokens from Uniswap v1 Migration to v2 would require upgrades to the unisocks.exchange front end as well as work on organizing the actual migration of assets from pool to pool This type of initiative won\u2019t have a huge impact on Uniswap financial performance, but could help onboard new devs into the UNI ecosystem (always a good thing)   Integrating LP tokens in other defi protocols  This is particularly close to my heart, I\u2019ve been hard at work reviewing UNI LPs to onboard as collateral to MakerDAO. Defi integrations could offer a more durable, long term advantage vs direct liquidity incentives (for example, UNI LPs can earn additional yield by borrowing against their assets from Maker and depositing to eg. Compound or Aave to capture the spread in interest rates.   Exploring opportunities for \u201cpayment for order flow\u201d to drive integration with wallets and dashboards - distribution will be incredibly important for the next wave of DEX competition  Check out Banteg\u2019s post hinting at PFOF incentives/revenue sharing for inspiration:      twitter.com    banteg (bantg)  If you are building a wallet or a dashboard, you'll soon be able to share rewards with Yearn for bringing TVL.

Governance will always have the option to turn it on if we get consensus around that option. But it seems like a one way decision, I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a clear way to reverse the fee mechanism if it starts to cut into our competitiveness.     tiuni:  the 0.3% LP fee clearly beats 0.25%.   This is a key point. Uniswap is basically giving LPs a uniform subsidy, with pairs delivering more trading volume gaining a larger benefit. Sushiswap and others\u2019 system of extracting protocol fees while also paying out (generally much larger value) token incentives is somewhat arbitrary. Taking an example related to my work with the MakerDAO risk core unit - Sushiswap is very unlikely to subsidize DAI/token LP pairs. This makes Uniswap the best partner for MakerDAO to integrate DAI/token LPs, because LPs get to keep the entire 0.3% fee with no protocol rent extraction. The availability of low cost borrowing power then gives Uni LPs additional earning potential - they can borrow from Maker and deposit to Aave/Compound to pocket the interest rate spread. For the time being, I feel like the advantages of building long term network effects outweigh potential fee earnings. ",

There have to be mechanisms, and compromises that can be explored. I don\u2019t have the expertise to know the feasibility of these things, but what incentive to the large number of small UNI holders is there to continue to hold? I think we\u2019ll see these people gradually lose interest, or they\u2019ll be shaken out of holding due to some fluctuations in price, or something along those lines. Are we going to let these people leave while the large hands accumulate more and more UNI? That circumstance will lead to the DAO not being very decentralised, no? ",

Having fee switch off is one of the areas where Uniswap\u2019s competitive advantage currently lies compared to Sushiswap. The 0.3% fee model scales much better for LPs than 0.25%+ some emissions. As for the reason to hold, UNI holders have the right to distribute UNI treasury, so that\u2019s gotta be worth something. They also have the right to turn that fee switch on when the time is right. I think it would make sense though to turn the switch on for the assets that we wish to accumulate with our treasury. And to compensate that by UNI emissions. Still, I would vote for emitting a little more towards these pairs than what we would earn from the fees. And what we get could be put to productive use, for instance, the fees from WBTC/ETH pair could go to Uniswap-controlled LP. ",

Is there no risk that Uniswap will just turn into a platform that\u2019s by in large governed by a few, self-interested whales, who\u2019ll manage to accumulate a dominant share of the voting power? 0.05% is probably too high a share of the total 0.3%, at this point in time, I saw a post on discord pointing out that this percentage is hardcoded, so changing it in smaller increments is probably going to have to wait until a new version release, but a smaller share would probably work fine for keeping small holders engaged. It would be something at least. I think you\u2019re wrong to see this exclusively as a way \u201cto steal fees from LP nothing else\u201d. Do you think there\u2019s another way to incentivise small Uni holders to maintain a position in governance, or do you think it\u2019s unimportant/ they should just wait for an indeterminate amount of time? For me personally, I can\u2019t really justify holding on to the whole 400 Uni I was gifted without some sort of return, it\u2019s too large a proportion of my crypto holdings. I imagine I\u2019m far from alone in this position, the volatility these past couple of days alone has pushed me to sell some of it, it\u2019ll be interesting to see if there\u2019s any analysis done on who buys it all during this drop.

This is an understandable perspective. But in early stage, high growth industries typically the vast majority of returns come from capital appreciation (value of asset increasing) rather than payouts to owners or buybacks. TSLA has no dividend and probably will not add one for many years to come, but is still one of the most successful assets by performance in the past decade. AMZN and most of the other tech stocks have followed a similar trajectory. I think it really comes down to time preference. Charging fees and paying them out to token holders could be good for returns in the short term, but I expect they will have a negative effect over longer time periods due to lower growth. ",

Time is on our side.   When you\u2019re saying \u201cour side\u201d you\u2019re referring to those who can afford exposure to risk, for instance, that Ethereum fees won\u2019t sink the ship so to speak. Now, I don\u2019t like being controversial in that speculation, but to many smallholders, the short-term anguish caused by high fees is threatening and stagnating a lot of projects and pushing away a lot, if not all, of new low equity users. I hope this conjecture can be seen as uncontroversial. The people who have enough tolerance for risk can also probably afford to accumulate the UNI that gets sold, they\u2019re also more likely to have the disposable income and the freedom to do their due diligence full-time, with minimal dependence on a job, to ensure their investment is going to bring a return. I raised this question:     Oblomov:  Do you think there\u2019s another way to incentivise small Uni holders to maintain a position in governance, or do you think it\u2019s unimportant/ they should just wait for an indeterminate amount of time?   I haven\u2019t really received a clear answer. I think this might be an interesting question for a lot of people. This fee switch will incentivize people with small amounts of UNI to hold but if we\u2019re not going to do the fee switch are there any contingencies that will help the DAO hold on to users who\u2019d otherwise leave? The only approximate response I got was this.     CremaFR:  either you care about governance or you care about profit   A very unfavourable take, I think. Wealthy people (who can afford the exposure to risk) don\u2019t care about one or the other, they care about both. Less wealthy people are more likely to be in a position where they can only really care about one, profit. Is this forum going to end up littered with accounts that disengage and likely sell out? ie.    How to tell my friends why LP and Governance is Important? Governance-Meta       I would take this question a step further and ask why participating in governance is important. As a very small fish HODLing UNI, I\u2019m spending time wondering whether it is time to sell.     The airdrop probably only enticed middle-class people, who could afford to experiment on uniswap in the eligibility period. There may be ways to entice or invite people from low socio-economic backgrounds which I think should also be explored. People from all walks of life will help ensure Uniswap, as a platform, can be as neutral (and hopefully as a result, as universal) as possible in who it appeals to. Here\u2019s a cheeky poll, which I hope might help everyone see what kind of DAO uniswap will have in the future.

The price of a share represents the expected potential future earnings of Tesla. This method of valuation was first done by Goldman Sachs in the early 1900s. Stock buy backs are popular among \u201cGrowth\u201d companies like Tesla because they function as a dividend for growth sectors. In the case of the token we own the exchange to a small degree. Profits should be distributed to Uni holders. A dividend is only one way of providing value to company stock owners. Likewise, Uni should provide value to all of it\u2019s owners through a staking mechanism, hopefully tied to voting. This will incentivize voting to create growth and expand volume. As the reward would be directly proportional to the volume on the exchange. Even if the reward is small now, the price of Uni will increase dramatically because of the future potential earnings from higher volume. Similar to Tesla. ",
