The PAXG token is a little bit problematic from an Oracle risk perspective, and this should be accounted for in the debt ceiling if Maker Governance chooses to onboard PAXG as collateral in the Maker Protocol. The issue stems from the volume being exceedingly small. The usual method of protecting from market manipulation is sample a diverse array of exchanges. However, in the case of PAXG, since the liquidity is so low, it becomes much more feasible for an attacker to manipulate enough markets at the same time to execute an Oracle attack. Therefore if Maker Governance insists on adding PAXG as a collateral-type the Oracle Team recommends an initial debt ceiling of not more than 1,000,000 in order to cap losses from a potential Oracle attack.

Thank you for the Assessment Nick! I think the entire community would agree with your recommendation of no more than 1M DC for PAXG. I do think that with time Paxos will get more institutional interest in PAXG (Paxos is out there raising funds), especially if things go haywire for the U.S. economy. So, hopefully we will see more volume. It could also be that PAXG users just hodl, and not much more you can do with the asset. Hopefully in the near future use the Maker Vaults and use their asset for more exciting things, than just holding exposure to Gold. ",
