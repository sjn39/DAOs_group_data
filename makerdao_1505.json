This post is not to criticize or rush into burning MKR (IMO it does not make sense to burn right now even though MKR price has declines) but to understand perspectives on when would be an appropriate time to do so. Below are a few thought-provoking questions regarding burning MKR.  When will surplus buffer be sufficient to start thinking about MKR burn? When the surplus buffer is sufficient, what would be the appropriate burn mechanism? A portion of stability or liquidation fees allocated to burn? Turning on PSM fees to burn? When the surplus buffer is sufficient, should new products include a revenue share for MKR burn? E.g. Revenue split for Vault X will be 95% to surplus buffer and 5% to burn MKR Is there a CU whose mandate includes analyzing MKR burn or issuances? How was the current surplus buffer goal (i.e. 250M) determined? Is the figure analyzed on a periodic frequency (e.g. Annually)?   Screenshot_20220802-094036_Chrome1080\u00d71083 102 KB  ",

CodeKnight:  If we want to deploy billions into RWAs, the our surplus buffer should be in the hundreds of millions.   That is what I was thinking as well. The 250M surplus buffer was probably the goal before a lot of asset deployment proposals passed so the goal might shift higher to mitigate liquidity amd credit risk. If we are able to look into how the 250M was derived we could overlay the new proposals to determine the new goal. ",

Seems that living in a CaR > SB would be very risky. I understand the CaR for crypto vaults, crypto assets and private credit but not really sure how it is derived for public credit (Bond ETFs). Since the public credit strategy is mostly in liquid ETFs is the CaR basically the potential 1-year capital depreciation? Noticed its ranging from 1.6% - 2.1%. ",

There were quite a few interesting comments in this direction in this thread earlier this year: [Signal Request] Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation & Resurrect the Burn Also some helpful technical recommendations/points from Risk, ie:    [Signal Request] Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation & Resurrect the Burn   We are proposing burning MKR based on specifications listed below using the newly released DssKiln  by the PECU. A predetermined amount of dai would be vested from the SB to the contract for the predetermined duration, which would then market buy MKR tokens directly from Uniswap v3 MKR/ETH (0.3% fee) in predetermined dai amounts based on specifications below and burn them by calling the MKR token burn(). The vesting option was chosen to enable governance to cancel the stream and essentially shut down the operation in the case it underperforms or a technical issue is uncovered. The negative side of the vesting solution is that it is much more gas intensive compared to a single deposit solution. Once the operation is tested, governance can change how the contract is funded and lower the keeper cost and ensure the community and market participants that burn will continue. There are possible unwanted instances, such as MEV and similar blockchain based market activity specific risks and griffing attacks, but we believe that the potential benefits of this SR outweighs the unwanted results. The proposed parameters for the permissionless open market operation are designed in a risk and unwanted outcomes minimization manner.   Would +1 @SebVentures\u2019 point above as well about the ALM forecast. I think burn discussions in general are tricky in the community because they touch on a relatively beloved traditional Maker feature (ie, the burn) but the analysis is necessarily complicated by macro, ALM, technical points etc. It\u2019s possible that the broad enthusiasm seen earlier in the year to restart the burn has waned somewhat with the arrival of the bear.
