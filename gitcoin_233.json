From the Governance Forum   Breakdown of Round Manager Personas for the Protocol, by Disruption Joe Joe created this post detailing the Round Manager Personas in a table. They are: Match Pool Funder(lead), Match Pool Funder(minor), Ecosystem Owner, Round Operator(community-led), Round Operator(Gitcoin-led). Joe invites forum readers to comment/reply to the post, or to check out the Miro board here.   Season 16 Workstream Budget Requests Here\u2019s a list of budget requests from GitcoinDAO\u2019s five existing workstreams: [S16 Proposal] DRAFT Gitcoin Product Collective Budget Request, by Kevin Olsen [S16 Proposal] DRAFT DAO Operations Budget Request, by Jodi  [S16 Proposal] DRAFT FDD Budget Request, by tigress [S16 Proposal] DRAFT Public Goods Funding Budget Request, by ceresstation [S16 Proposal] MMM Budget Request, by CoachJ   The New Grants Protocol Flywheel by Disruption Joe Joe builds on Owocki\u2019s original \u201cThe Grants 2.0 Flywheel\u201d post. The central question of the post is, \u201cHow do we create sustainability in the mechanism?\u201d(read Joe\u2019s previous post \u201cA model for Gitcoin sustainability\u201d here). Joe posits that, as we begin to roll out alpha and beta versions of grants protocols in the next 2-6 months, we can start onboarding other web3 ecosystems and communities now\u2013in fact, the success of Grants 2.0 may depend on how well we onboard new communities to the grants protocol. He also talks about how GTC price and utility factor into this flywheel. Joe ends the post with a message that we, as a DAO, need to think deeply about sustainability, and which levers create the most impact.   Messari Governor Note: Decentralizing Gitcoin by joel.miya  Joel Miyazawa, an analyst at Messari, wrote this report as an analysis on \u201c[the GR16 Structure proposal forum post] and Gitcoin\u2019s transition to a decentralized protocol\u201d. It\u2019s free to read on Messari\u2019s site, and provides a good overview of Gitcoin\u2019s transition to Grants 2.0 from an external perspective. Thank you, Joel!     Latest Posts from the Gitcoin Blog   Announcing the decentralized future of Gitcoin Grants, by Team Gitcoin This post gives insight into Gitcoin\u2019s process of decentralizing it\u2019s grants program from a centralized platform, to a set of open source, decentralized protocols. Testing and soliciting feedback from previous Grantees is a top priority as we continue to roll-out the new grants protocols.   Announcing: The Fantom Alpha Round, by Team Gitcoin The Fantom Foundation is leveraging Gitcoin\u2019s grants protocol for an initial round allocating 125,000 FTM to projects building within the Fantom ecosystem.

The two dive into what, in fact, information actually wants, the fascinating ways in which information replicates, how we avoid a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 type scenario when it comes to information, and so much more.   GreenPill #59: Impact Networks with David Ehrlichman \u2013 David Erlichman is author of the book, Impact Networks: Create Connection, Spark Collaboration, and Catalyze Systemic Change. He is also the co-founder of Hats Protocol, which tokenizes contributor roles for DAOs. The study of networks is increasingly popular as an approach to understanding complex networks. David has combined theory and action through his writing and building to uncover patterns in how we organize and coordinate.
