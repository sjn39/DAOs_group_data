As a result, this proposal will be updated to the new format in a NEW post. That post will include a link to this proposal in order to preserve the discussion in comments below. You can read the new post here.  Overview Project Name: Across Protocol Author Name: Across community + Risk Labs (Britt is the author of this post, and the best point of contact. She is the community lead for Across, employed by Risk Labs. Risk Labs is the foundation that built and supports Across) Number of OP tokens requested: 1,000,000 $OP Timeline for distribution: until they run out. We hope to see these rewards distributed over a 9-12 month period. L2 Recipient Address: 0x8180d59b7175d4064bdfa8138a58e9babffda44a  Relevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)  Total Bridge Volume: $448,940,817 TVL: $71,290,836 in total Total Bridge Users: 70,331 Total Transfers: 161,586   Optimism alignment:  Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure bridge between L1 and L2s.  Across protocol is a novel bridging method that combines an optimistic oracle, bonded relayers and single-sided liquidity pools to provide decentralized instant transactions from rollup chains to and from Ethereum mainnet. Across Protocol supports bridging to and from Optimism from Ethereum mainnet and L2s.  UMA launched Across Protocol in early November 2021. Across is a bridging solution which uses UMA\u2019s Optimistic Oracle.  Proposal for token distribution:  We have two planned mechanisms for the distribution of $OP tokens. We aim to use 75% of the tokens to subsidize bridge fees for users that would like to transfer assets to Optimism.  Currently, we support USDC, ETH, DAI, WBTC, and UMA.  The remaining 25% of the tokens will be used to reward anyone outside of Risk Labs (the team who builds and supports Across) who runs a relayer on Optimism.  How will the OP tokens be distributed?  Bridge Users For any user going to Optimism, we will rebate their bridge fee 105% (so they will earn 5% to bridge to Optimism).  The composure of this rebate depends on whether or not the user is already earning $ACX rewards on their transaction.  If there is no $ACX reward, the bridge fee will be rebated back 80% $OP and 25% $ACX.  If there is an $ACX reward, the $OP amount will be (105%-$ACX%).  All of this will be computed on the bridge fee component of a transfer and capped at 12 basis points (which covers the entire fee during periods of low to moderate bridge utilization. Note: Across differentiates between the bridge fee and the gas fee. This distribution is only applied to bridge fees, so network conditions that cause an increase in gas fees should not make an impact in this program. For more information on our bridge fees, you can see this section of our docs site. Relayers We will direct 25% of this grant towards rewarding non-Risk Labs relayers that facilitate transfers to Optimism. This will be dispersed as 0.01% (1bp) on the amount transferred in each relay. For context, this is equal to a 33% bonus for relayers operating on Optimism. This incentive will last until the 25% is exhausted. Note: This was an addition to the original proposal, which only rewarded bridge users. It was decided that this would serve to enhance the overall bridge experience for Optimism users, making it a worthwhile investment. Having a robust relayer network strengthens the security mechanism of the bridge, and reduces transaction times during high traffic events.  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?  Users will only receive the tokens if they bridge assets to Optimism or run a relayer on Optimism. Both of these require people to move their funds to Optimism.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?  Because they will find all the great dapps on Optimism and want to stay!  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  This depends on bridging volume we see to Optimism.  Hopefully it is large and tokens are all used within 1 year.  Has your project previously received an OP token grant? If yes, what\u2019s the status of these tokens?  No  How much will your project match in co-incentives?  For bridge users, we will match between 31% to 320% depending on the type of transaction as explained above. Here is how that math works out. If a bridgooor uses a ref link and is Platinum then they get 80% rebate in $acx and 25% in $op.  80/25 = 320%. If a bridgooor doesn\u2019t use ref link, they get 80% $op and 25% $acx.  25/80 = 31%.

It would be dynamic, so this question still applies, but we actually break it down in our UI to show 2 different types of fees - the gas fee and the bridge fee. And we\u2019d be applying this to bridge fees rather than gas fees, so fluctuations in gas shouldn\u2019t make an impact here. Here\u2019s a link to where we discuss that in our docs, but the tl;dr is that the bridge fee isn\u2019t reliant on network conditions. Instead, the bridge fee is based on liquidity pool utilization. We\u2019d only expect to hand out crazy numbers of tokens if we were experiencing crazy numbers of transfers to OP - like 100s of millions in volume just to OP. ",

I will update the main post accordingly - thank you for that feedback. We do currently subsidize with $ACX for anyone using our referral link program (you can self refer). So this would be complementary to those efforts. I also agree that 1mm is a lot! I think one path forward could be to reduce that amount, but we might also consider adding in a second mechanism by which the tokens could be distributed. For example, our system relies on a network of relayers. If we were to incentivize relayers to operate on OP, that would serve a few purposes. It would make the bridge to OP able to support larger volumes, increase the security of the bridge, and encourage these parties to keep funds on OP rather than directing them elsewhere. I\u2019m curious if you think this addition to the proposal would be well received? We\u2019re pretty keen on getting creative with this grant, and using it to benefit as many of the users that exist in the Across+OP ecosystem as possible. So I\u2019d be really happy to get any feedback on that! ",

                    "content": "Well written proposal, thanks Britt! I think the proposal is well designed and I appreciate the fact that there will be matching incentives. Across has already integrated two versions of its bridging architecture with Optimism so that\u2019s a bonus also. I do find the duration of the program to be long dated and the amount of $OP being requested is quite significant. I think however the length of the proposal and size of the $OP allocation is reasonable in light of the following facts:  Across will be matching incentives The bridge is already live Proposed distribution is very simple and predictable  With those points in mind, I would still suggest possibly shortening the proposal to a 6-9 month target length instead of 1 year, then propose a continuation/extension as the OP distribution gets close to finishing. I say this because it gives Optimism governance reassurance when a program brings successful results on shorter timeframes (indicating it\u2019s effectiveness), after which projects can always propose a continuation/extension or even a whole new proposal, with a much higher likelihood of being approved a second time given previous positive results. I do not feel too strongly about this change however, and would still approve the proposal the way it is, if Across really feels a 1 year program is warranted. ",

It reduces risk for everyone and it will make the approval easier.     britt:  I\u2019d be keen to hear your thoughts about also incentivizing [non-Risk Labs] relayers that operate on OP.

That\u2019s the thing, with a smaller allocation and smaller time frame you could include this in the current proposal as an experiment or in the continuation/extension. I think the first proposal should focus on what gives more direct impact to users, what is easier to measure and evaluate.

Reducing the amount to 400k can be more reasonable, at least you have some analysis about expected expenditures to share and discuss with us. Even don\u2019t worry about reducing the time of distribution (let\u2019s say, six months) we will happy to see the results after (in case of approval) and then reapply.     britt:  We aim to use the token to subsidize bridge fees for users that would like to transfer assets to Optimism. Currently, we support USDC, ETH, DAI, WBTC, and UMA.   (Suggestion) as we can see, there\u2019s so many projects applying to Phase 1 and incentiving liquidity in so many assets, don\u2019t you think it would be positive (this is the moment) to join an alliance with some other projects and thus increase the list of available tokens?

It\u2019s not super relevant to this proposal, but might be useful for anyone else wondering. tl;dr - we\u2019re happy to add new tokens, but it requires a good amount of capital to do. When we support a new token, we have to make sure there are sufficient funds in the Hub pool to support the anticipated volume (without compromising the UX), AND at least 1 funded relayer on each supported chain to be able to support transfers. This is something we hope will become less of a barrier as more tokens are onboarded and more people start running relayers. . . . I\u2019ll also use this as a chance to reply to @millie in regard to relayers  The code for relayers has been open source this whole time, and technically anyone could have spun up a relayer if they wanted to (so it\u2019s not a permissioned role as it is in some other bridges). Risk Labs has been doing lots of work to make it easier and more profitable for folks to run a relayer, and we\u2019re at the point now where we\u2019d like to see people start trying it out. We have a few external relayers now, and are providing ongoing support to anyone interested in doing this. I\u2019m happy to report that it\u2019s been really smooth so far! In terms of ACX incentives for relayers, I\u2019ll pass this feedback along for consideration, and thank you again for the feedback. ",

Fast bridging is vital for a rollup to gain mass adoption and allows for healthy arbitrage, so to sum things up, yes I would support this proposal if there was a carve out for Relayer incentives included in the pitch as well!

Yes, thanks to reaffirm these points, let me return to the point expressed later by ScaleWeb3 here:     ScaleWeb3:  Generally speaking, we don\u2019t believe the most effective use of OP funds is giving large grants to 50+ bridge projects. (50 * 1Mio Op * 1.5$\u2026)   It\u2019s true that a situation may arise in which many bridge projects are already being funded and others are in search of that (6 already passed, and 2, including this one, in discussion). With this I mean that (and only my vision) the more bridges we should start to see some initiatives that seek to solve particular problems of this ecosystem; by example a simple one, dedicate themselves to specific tokens. For example withdrawal waiting 7 days is always a problem to attract liquidity from non-top tokens into Optimism, and perhaps a coordination with other protocols will allow them to add other tokens, if the problem is identified (by example, in this case see this DeFi protocol assigning some bridge incentives). Again this is just an open idea that I think is an interesting opportunity and I share with you and everyone here. For now, reducing amount would be appropriate, unless you want to share with us a more detailed spending plan or projected use.  I have seen that you have changed the proposal from Draft to Ready and I want to emphasize that the governance process is currently being revamped and an important point is a new template that projects will have to apply (it\u2019s under discussion, so don\u2019t make formal changes now and wait for their approval, but it\u2019s good to keep an eye on it and be prepared).

The tl;dr is this - 25% of tokens go towards non-RL relayers on OP at a roughly ~33% bonus to what they already receive as a relayer. @SEED_LATAM_Joxes I\u2019ll tag you here as well since I think you may find this to be relevant. There are a couple of other points you mention that I\u2019d like to briefly respond to. First, can you help me understand what additional detail you\u2019d like to see in the existing plan? In my opinion, one of the strengths of this proposal is that it\u2019s pretty straightforward about how these tokens will be used. Second, you mention that you\u2019d like to see some initiatives that seek to solve particular problems in this ecosystem like onboarding more tokens. I completely agree with this sentiment. In fact, one of the other proposals we\u2019re working on right now is one that would add BAL to Across. And while I believe these efforts are essential, I don\u2019t see a particularly obvious tie-in that makes sense for a long-term initiative like this. Having said that, I would encourage voters here to do their research and make sure the protocols receiving these tokens are seeking to improve the ecosystem in more than one way. I believe that we are. I also believe that there are great opportunities ahead for collaborative grants. And finally, thank you for pointing out the updated template. I\u2019ll keep an eye on it to see if it goes into effect during this voting cycle and update this proposal accordingly. ",
