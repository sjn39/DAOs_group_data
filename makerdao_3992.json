Welcome to Know your MIP #09, where we get to know more about the MIPs that are proposed to the Maker community, and when we can discuss the mechanisms and the team behind them. In this episode, we will be discussing how B.Protocol would like to be integrated into Maker and its utility. For other episodes of KYM, please check the forum.

Your backstop keeper consists of two types of services. You guarantee that there are funds available for liquidating this debt but you also have this B.Protocol AMM which is good because it has this high amplification coefficient and it makes minimum slippage when you liquidate it. To be sure: these are two separate entities or ports within the protocol?  30:38  Someone: You are providing stability pool as a service for Maker, right? You use the stability pool to get ETH through liquidations and then you are using, for example, Uniswap V3 to swap it back to more DAI and feed it back to your stability pool. Instead of getting ETH, you get more DAI, right?  31:40  Frank Cruz: You incentivize folks to deposit LUSD or DAI by giving them B.Protocol tokens, is that right?  33:08  Pepper (from chat): Is the Dai float guaranteed to be used?  39:20  Someone (from chat): Question about the monopoly.  43:20  Someone (from chat): How important is the yield?  49:57  Frank Cruz: I saw that you are using the Chainlink price feed for LUSD, right?  50:34  Frank Cruz: You mentioned you use Gelato and Chainlink as a backup, how would it work here?  52:20  Juan Guill\u00e9n: Regarding the next steps, are you planning on going into the next cycle or waiting a bit more for comments?  53:36  Primoz Kordez: I have a comment from a Risk perspective. I know the original intention was to lower the liquidation ratio of these Vaults and I think this is still the whole idea apart from improving the liquid efficiency or auction throughput. It really depends on the oracles when it comes to BARK. Not the medianizer that is used to settle auctions but when triggering them. This is something you should probably need to discuss with the Oracles team, because if they prefer to use the delayed price, this is a problem.  55:52  Juan Guill\u00e9n: For anyone watching this offline, what is the best way to contact you?   Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 56:38  Thank you for the presentation! It was really good and informative. Thanks to everyone else for coming!   Credits   @gala produced this summary.
