Taking artistic NFTs as an example, NFT artists may wish to rent out the use rights of their works to media companies in the allotted time, or NFT musicians may wish to make their music available to listeners as per playing duration. Therefore, to better serve NFT developers to meet such needs and develop more sophisticated NFT products, we propose directly introducing rentable usage rights to complement the ERC standard. There is similar accomplishment in eip-2615 which extended ERC721. But can\u2019t reach the charactor of ERC1155. ",
