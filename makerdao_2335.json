                    "content": " Introduction Now that the MIPs Framework has been ratified, a flood of collateral onboarding applications has started poping up. It\u2019s great to see so much enthusiasm from partners to be added as collateral. The Maker Protocol needs a diverse portfolio of collateral to grow and reinforce the peg. As the Oracle Team, it\u2019s my responsibility to help guide the community through the collateral onboarding process with respect to Oracles by giving recommendations. At the same time, my duties extend much further as is documented in the Oracle Team Mandate. Just to give an idea of what I\u2019m talking about, here\u2019s a non-exhaustive list of what my team is currently juggling in no particular order. Collateral Onboarding  Assist the community in onboarding new collateral types  Data Integrity  Integrate signed Coinbase data in the Oracles Implement a robust and trustless way to query on-chain storage values along with Merkel proofs to validate data  Incentives  Come up with a proper incentive mechanism for relayers  Reliability  Create redundancy within every module of the Oracle client so a bug in any module can\u2019t halt the Oracle protocol. Think geth vs parity in 2016 when all the geth nodes crashed simultaneously and the Ethereum network would have halted were it not for the parity nodes holding up the network on their own. In particular I want to ensure we\u2019re not reliant on Secure Scuttlebutt and instead have multiple Transport Layers for Feeds to gossip price data.  Resiliency  Create a tx manager service with more dynamic gas pricing algorithm when network is congested to stabilize Oracle latency even when the market is at its most volatile  Data Sensitivity  Implement more advanced stateful price querying tooling that can implement much more advanced Data Models such as CCCAGG (a time-sensitive volume weighted average price).  Decentralization  Find and assist new high quality partners to onboard as Light Feeds Create a smart contract to fund Feed payments through the Maker Protocol in a decentralized manner. Create a decentralized oracle freeze mechanism similar to the decentralized emergency shutdown module to enable MKR holders to intervene in the case of an Oracle attack.  Product  Find and assist Ethereum projects to get whitelisted Oracle access  Transparency  Implement an Oracle Feed Dashboard that shows all Oracle and Feed data in an easy to understand format.  Governance  Create a robust MIP framework around Oracle governance (formerly the Oracle Governance Framework defined in the Oracle Team Mandate).  Velocity  Find, hire, and onboard talented developers to my team to increase the quality and throughput of the Oracle Team\u2019s work.  Yea, that\u2019s a lot. The context for most of these is missing which I hope to remedy at a later date. There needs to be a balance between time devoted to the collateral onboarding process and time devoted to ensuring the long term development of the Oracle protocol. What collateral types are easy to create Oracles for? Which ones are difficult? Are there enough data sources to create a secure Oracle that is resistant to manipulation? Is there a key piece missing that is blocking us from onboarding this collateral type until some later point in time? While I don\u2019t presume to have all the answers, I\u2019ve composed an initial methodology the Oracle Team is utilizing to prioritize collateral onboarding work versus other endeavors in the Oracle domain.   Collateral Onboarding Proposal Methodology V1.1.0 Author: Niklas Kunkel Contributors: Date: 05/05/20  Disclaimer The collateral onboarding recommendations published by the Oracle Team in accordance with MIP6 are independent and non-binding. In other words, a recommendation by the Oracle Team does not impede the collateral onboarding process. Ultimately it is the community\u2019s decision whether to include a collateral in the Maker Protocol. Like other Domain Teams, The Oracle Team has no authority to unilaterally include or exclude a collateral, it merely provides guidance in relation to Oracles. This methodology is intended to evolve over time to adapt to the ever changing circumstances affecting Maker governance. The recommendations are evaluated in relation to the technical feasibility and technical complexity to create a secure Oracle for the proposed collateral type and don\u2019t take any other factors into account.  Technical Complexity Evaluation Determine how complex integrating Oracles for this collateral type would be and how long it would take to implement such a solution. Data Sources: Are there sufficient high quality data sources available to construct a reliable, resilient, and secure Oracle for the proposed collateral asset? Can the current tooling support the types of data sources that are needed? Data Models: Can the current tooling support the type of data modeling that is needed? What would it take to expand the functionality of the current tooling to support the necessary data sources and data modeling? Missing: Is a solution currently not possible because of a key missing component? Externalities: What dependencies (both technical and system), risks, costs, and latency are added to the Oracle Protocol as a function of these added features? Deliverables: Does adding these features interfere with ongoing or planned development of new tooling on the Oracle Team roadmap? Does adding these features require work and/or coordination from other stakeholders such as the Smart Contracts Team(s)? How long would it take to design, implement, test, and deploy such a solution?  Recommendation This is where the Oracle Team delivers its recommendation to the community whether to accept or defer the collateral onboarding along with a short summary of the reasons for doing so. Note that the Collateral Onboarding Greenlight Vote takes place regardless of the Oracle Team\u2019s recommendation. It is merely one data point among many that Maker Governance needs to factor into their decision.

With the original oracle mandate, governance ratified the following: MKR governors signal their intent to fund Feed Stipends through Stability Fees once the functionality for this has been added to the Maker Protocol. I\u2019m pretty sure this is technically possible using executive spells, but it sounds like there is a further technical solution planned? I could see these stipends being paid through the MIPs process using a subproposal every month, such a solution would not be ideal with the current governance cycle though, as due to bundling if any monthly executive failed oracles would not receive their stipends. I note there is a mention of this in the \u2018Decentralization\u2019 section above, how high a priority is this? ",

Having the funding replaced by the protocol I think is an important final step for governance to complete taking over ownership of the Oracles.

I sketched out a POC a while back that would support a generalized decentralized payment mechanism that  governance could use among other things to distribute Feed Stipends. In the short term there are more pressing concerns on the roadmap so it\u2019s difficult to estimate when this will be ready. ",

Also the economic impact should probably be adjusted for percent of the token staked and therefore not a part of the circulating market cap.  Not all tokens are stakable. But even for the ones that are, why would we discount the amount staked? The stakers could remove their staked tokens and move them into the Maker Protocol no? I have a feeling staking is going to evolve similar to how hash power and mining evolved. A bunch of miners/stakers freely moving to whichever blockchain/token has the best returns.

These recommendations are just one data point among many that the community should factor in to their decision. Second, I\u2019ve removed the Economic Impact section. It\u2019s not a parameter that should determine whether a collateral type is added but rather an indicator for prioritization. The evaluation matrix of mapping technical complexity to economic impact did not properly represent this relationship. I want to emphasize this is a live document. The community should adapt and update the methodology as we discover what works and what doesn\u2019t. ",
