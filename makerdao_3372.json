Moreover, it took a while before people were willing to leverage ETH again. Pre-2020, as far as I know, changing the SF has had a reasonable effect on DAI supply.  Anyway, at this point it doesn\u2019t matter what we set PSM to, any blacklisting of USDC is already existential for Maker.

                    "content": "So one caveat to this is that holders of ETH-A vaults (and any other non-stablecoin vault) also really want the price of DAI to be as stable as possible. The reason for this is that if they have to de-lever in a crash scenario, they don\u2019t want to have to pay $1.05 for DAI (because everyone wants DAI in a crash scenario this pushes the price up.) So in this way having the PSM facility actually makes other vaults safer to hold as well. I do agree with you that in an ideal world we would keep the total amount of USDC below \u2018existential risk\u2019 level. I think most people agree with that part. The question is more how do we get there from here. The key solution is to onboard more non-stablecoin collateral, but how to go about this? 1) Reducing ETH (and other) vault fees is an option, but what happens if (like last time) we do that and it has no significant effect on the total amount of stables? We\u2019ve both cut revenue (and system safety, given less buffer less quickly) and in all likelihood not fixed the problem (brought USDC below \u2018existential risk\u2019 level.) 2a) The other option (that is currently being pursued) is to onboard new assets for use as collateral. The difficulty here is that ETH and BTC are by far the largest crypto-assets, so there is limited opportunity in the purely crypto space. Liquidity pool tokens are an opportunity here, but it remains to be seen how popular these are. 2b) The other part of this option is to pursue off-chain assets as collateral. This has its own complexities and problems, but can potentially scale much more quickly once it\u2019s up and running. One of the key arguments against point #1 is that reduced revenue will also reduces our ability to pursue #2a and #2b. Currently this is more theoretical than observed, but in principle more resources gives a greater capacity for action in these directions.     AstronautThis:  Increasing the DC should be an absolute last resort measure because this is dangerous in the long term.   In theory if we pursue #2a and #2b the long-term situation should be much improved. The danger is higher in the short and medium terms (before we can get real world assets and additional valuable cryptoassets onboarded.) ",

We still have 26 days before there is any danger to the peg and we have the opportunity to see what effect lowering the SF has in the next days. The other thing I really think the community needs to start talking about is how we view the peg. Our peg is a soft peg and it would be really beneficial to define service standards e.g. DAI will exceed 1.01 only x% of the time. x can be arbitrarily small depending on what the community decides but must be a nonzero value. This will help understand what resources we need to absorb demand and supply shocks - in particular, how big the PSM needs to be relative to total DAI issued. ",

Liquidity pool tokens are an opportunity here, but it remains to be seen how popular these are.   I know a lot of people are waiting for increased DCs on the LP assets (particularly uniswap V2 LP tokens). Frankly what I am seeing in the space is such that demand is high for capital leveraging.   Which as this increases could lead to a very nasty de-leveraging event which will bring Maker and the entire DeFI space right back to the same place.  Where does one find DAI liquidity when collateral values are compressing hard and fast? From my seat the ONLY collateral that probably would retain value in such an event is RWA (Real Estate, PMs, etc.) your 2b above.  Currently the ability for this collateral to mint DAI is exceedingly limited and during a crypto crash event neither ETH, wBTC or even the LP tokens etc. are going to be able to mint DAI sticking us right back into the stablecoin PSM solution. My general take on this is that giving the markets free reign without heaping on a risk fee is basically like heaping more explosives on a bomb that you hope will never go off.    I also think everyone knows that Maker is probably very close to existential event if Circle or authorities decide to clamp down on stablecoin use leaving Maker not just with a potential collateral deficit, but also wholesale inability to mange the PEG.    Probably now the greatest weakness of Maker short of someone seeking a way to ES this system unexpectedly, or manipulating network access at the miner hubs during a high demand network event to exploit the liquidation system.

Yes, if this happens I\u2019m okay with MKR going back down to $200 and minting another couple of hundred thousand MKR via Flop Auctions, so be it. Nothing surprises me in life. ",
