While we are happy to address whatever attendees feel is important, we\u2019d prefer to focus on the future rather than the past. We\u2019d also prefer to engage on substance rather than politics. What matters for Real World Assets at MakerDAO is taking what we, as a community, have achieved thus far and parlaying it into future successes. In this session, we will host prospective RWF-0x contributors: @christiancdpetersen @teej @eumenes The team will make brief introductions of the core unit members, followed by an open floor for questions, queries, rants (from teej!), pontifications (from Eric!), and concerns! Note: Eric may not be in attendance, as he\u2019s currently with his wife and kids on vacation. What a time to be out-of-office! Onwards.  Join us!  @juan and @retro will host.
