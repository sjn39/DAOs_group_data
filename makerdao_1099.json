Former SEC director Hinman made millions from a pro-Ethereum firm during tenure (protos.com) As per the article, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by a whistleblower has evidenced that former Securities and Exchange Commission  Director William Hinman was receiving millions of dollars in retirement benefits from a pro-Ethereum law firm (Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett) during his time at the SEC. Also of interest to me, as I was unaware of this, is that there is an Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. I haven\u2019t\u2019 had time to really look at the members but law firm wise, I saw some large firms that typically have astronomically high rates for legal services. ",

Fortune 500 companies were falling over each other to announce that they were going to use Ethereum as a way of cutting transaction costs, particularly in B2B. There were some efforts to try to build \u2018private\u2019 or \u2018consortium\u2019 Ethereum chains that individual businesses (Microsoft, EY I think) or groups of businesses  would use solely for internal transactions. The Ethereum Enterprise Alliance was a big player originally, but you don\u2019t hear that much about \u2018enterprise Ethereum\u2019 anymore. These days, Fortune 500 companies are much more likely to announce a NFT drop\u2026 ",
