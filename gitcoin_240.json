This week, the crypto community reacted to the implosion of FTX, and its effects on the market.  This week, the crypto exchange FTX shut down. The event sent shockwaves through crypto markets and communities, with some comparing the implosion of FTX to Mt. Gox and other cataclysmic events in crypto history. Crypto prices across the board plummeted on the news. From Twitter, we asked, \u201cWhat are your biggest takeaways from this? What lessons should we never forget?\u201d Some responses:   \u201cSelf-sovereignty is still the best choice. Own your keys, own your crypto.Own your identity, own your data.\u201d \u2013 @humptycalderon   \u201cdecentralize yourself / decentralize your data / capture, collapse, rugging are inevitable / unless you are decentralized\u201d \u2013 @epowell101   \u201csystemic anti fragility > systemic fragility / you can cast the dice 1,000 times and the outcome is the same\u201d \u2013 @owocki    In This Issue of the Digest  DAO Happenings This Week   New Posts in the Governance Forum   This Week\u2019s GreenPill Episodes   New and Active Governance Proposals  \u2013 None this week. Upcoming Events   Opportunities for Builders       DAO Happenings This Week   The application portal for Fantom\u2019s Alpha Round opened last Friday! Fantom is using Gitcoin\u2019s grants protocol to run an initial round allocating 125,000 FTM to projects building within the Fantom ecosystem. Read our announcement on the Gitcoin blog, and then check out Fantom\u2019s post for additional details!   The Open Data Science Hackathon is hosting a Twitter Space next Tuesday to announce hackathon winners and results! That\u2019s Tuesday, 11/15, at 10 AM ET. Schedule a reminder here.   Listen to last week\u2019s Gitcoin x Lukso Hackathon Twitter Space. Gloria spoke with @lukso_io and their 1st place hackathon winner @lookso_io on a retro of the hackathon. Check to the recording here.      From the Governance Forum These are the top three posts from this week in the Gitcoin Governance forum. See the latest here.   [Discussion & Feedback Request] Grants Protocol Alpha Round Eligibility by Connor  Gitcoin governance has approved the decision to sunset cGrants and transition to the Grants Protocol with this Snapshot proposal. Instead of running GR16 in December, we will run an \u201cAlpha Round\u201d on the protocol in January, with the goal of testing the Grants Protocols product while supporting established grantees. The Alpha Round will consist of 3 separate matching pools: Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, and Climate Solutions. These rounds will be open to a subset of existing grantees with a goal to support about 300 projects in total. Read the post and add your feedback.   From Gitcoin Driven to Community Driven by Disruption Joe  Joe writes that, while Gitcoin has defined both its 100-year purpose and essential intents, it still lacks a \u201cholistic product vision & strategy to guide the entirety of the DAO through the transition to the grants protocol\u201d. Joe offers definitions of Gitcoin terms, current strategy, and future strategy. The future strategy is based upon a four-quadrant model Joe has named \u201cGitcoin\u2019s 4 Quadrants of Success\u201d(see below). The main idea is that Gitcoin programs and protocols should drive the creation of community programs and projects. Joe seeks to conduct a strategy session to create a SWOT analysis that will guide leadership in making strategic decisions.   \u200b\u200b 1248\u00d7982 126 KB    Is Gitcoin over its skis? should we hold spending flat while addressing unavoidable risks? by epowell101  As a Gitcoin Steward, Evan asks, \u201cShould we derisk and hold workstream spending flat for S16?\u201d. He cites the following factors: we have not proven product market fit for the protocols; we have not proven our ability to deliver on time, on quality, the protocol software; we are not \u2018DevReling\u2019 successfully quite yet; macro uncertainty. He applauds MMM\u2019s planned work on persona funnels for S16, Grants Ops working with GPC to hire Dev Rel help, and the plan by DAO Ops to grow a technical support capability. Additionally, he sees how FDD is decentralizing itself into the OpenData Community as significant.
