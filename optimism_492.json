Growth Experiment Grants Project description: Atlantis World to leverage Diia integration for sybil resistance to onboard up to millions of real people into Optimism with gamified educational quests and OP rewards, starting with an 50,000 user onboarding pilot. Diia Diia is a Ukrainian government led application where more than 18.5M Ukrainians custody their digital biometric passport, driving license, pay their taxes, and can even get legally married on mobile. Watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMmk0HSZgDI The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine is on a mission to make Ukraine the world\u2019s most convenient country. Diia also features a learning centre, where more than 2M Ukrainians are actively learning about a variety of key topics. The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine is also launching a free crypto literacy course inside of Diia including 100 hours of theory & practice, that will feature Optimism thanks to Atlantis World partnership efforts: https://twitter.com/atlantis0x/status/1606709980131893248 Exciting note: Diia won\u2019t stop in Ukraine, meaning after successful pilot, we might even be able to expand to other countries such as Estonia for OP onboarding! https://e-estonia.com/estonia-to-pilot-a-national-mobile-app-based-on-the-ukrainian-diia-application/ A Diia integration for human verification means that financial rewards couldn\u2019t be attacked by bots & multi-accounts- meaning that only real people would be incentivised to participate in the Optimism network. We\u2019re excited by the premise of enabling financial rewards & incentives for Ukrainians that participate in gamified education inside of Atlantis World, becoming familiar and proficient when it comes to interacting with the OP Stack / ecosystem beyond the crypto literacy course that will be launched soon. This course will also go hand in hand with our go to market strategy, ensuring that we\u2019re able to reach users that will participate in the incentivised learning quests. Another key part of our GTM and attracting the right number of users to participate is embedded in our recent humanitarian aid efforts: having helped more than 400,000 people, we still have an active 50,000+ support requests from women living in Ukraine that we\u2019re working through. OP incentives would become a welcome boost to humanitarian aid efforts that we\u2019ve spearheaded in the past, such as by distributing crypto donations in fiat with around 8,000+ virtual Mastercard debits to mothers affected by the war, enabling Ukrainians to learn about and use Optimism to offset living costs during war time devastation, internal displacement etc. Onboarding Inside of Atlantis World\u2019s OP City users would be able to embark on gamified quests that teach them about Optimism and how to use ecosystem applications and tooling. Since Atlantis World is a social platform by nature, users could also attend social events, gatherings and workshops to get even more familiar with the Optimism community and wider ecosystem. We have built gamified, OP native questing flows in the past. For example, when we launched our pilot back in July 2022, more than 2000 users\u2026  Connected their wallet to the Optimism RPC, a necessary step in order to transact on Optimism for the first time! Bridged assets from Ethereum Main Network to Optimism Minted an NFT as a record of their work & learning, granting them access to perks and further game/social experiences  Inside of the game within the first 24 hours! OP City has grown a lot since then, and other questing / social activity has remained high- with more than 16,000 registered players and a number of Optimism ecosystem protocols hosting events and gatherings in the bigger & improved OP City! We hope to retain users by making them a part of the social aspects underpining the OP City, for example - LIVE workouts hosted by OptiChads https://twitter.com/OptiChads/status/1620822688901246976  Bigger and improved OP City1280\u00d71280 268 KB   Project links:  Website: https://atlantis.world  Twitter: https://twitter.com/atlantis0x  Discord/Discourse/Community: Atlantis World  Please include all other relevant links below: Blockchain edu course announcement by the Vice Prime Minister & minister @ Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine ft.

All funding raised was distributed between conference ops expenses(everyone volunteered), hackathon prizes & charitable donation to children affected by war. https://kyivtechsummit.com https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/10/vitalik-buterin-makes-surprise-appearance-at-kyiv-tech-summit-in-show-of-support-for-ukraine/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3krD4lyat0   WomenCryptoGuida - 2.5k+ Ukrainian web3 women community we\u2019ve co-founded with ELLE magazine https://t.me/WomensCrypto   KERNEL (Rev&CJ are guides @ KERNEL, contributing since May \u201821) Kernel Community | Kernel   TA Ventures https://taventures.vc/   SavePak relief NFTs - We launched the first ever NFTs tied to real world humaniterian relief goods natively on Optimism- resulting in the distribution of food, water, sanitation and shelter to the frontlines of the climate fuelled flooding disaster in Pakistan which has unfortunately been affecting millions of innocent people. https://gov.optimism.io/t/savepakistan-launch-the-first-ever-nfts-tied-to-real-world-humanitarian-relief-goods-on-optimism/4370   Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): 16,000+ registered players 2000+ users onboarded into Optimism in 24hrs back in July Example quest NFT: https://opensea.io/collection/optimism-city-pathfinder Competitors, peers, or similar projects: Gather, Decentraland, The Sandbox, Cryptovoxels Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes Optimism native?: Yes (this specific project) Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Atlantis World has been live on Optimism since July 2022. Depending on date of grant distribution, Diia onboarding project delivery expected Q3-Q4 2023. Ecosystem Value Proposition:   What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? One of the largest problems we have identified with usage incentive programs is that they typically lack a privacy-first method to verify the humanity of users that are earning this incentives. Typically, a barrage of multi-account and bot attacks occur, resulting in a limited long term impact on ecosystem growth. Incentives dry out, and the mercenary group that exploited the majority of incentives move onto the next project that is paying out.  How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? By leveraging our Diia integration, we\u2019re able to become sybil resistant, paying out educational incentives to only true, real humans. Also, because of the way it works, we won\u2019t custody the personal KYC data of anybody that is using Atlantis World to learn about Optimism and earn some OP. Instead, user will be redirected to Diia platform, leverage their biometric digital passport to sign their humanity, and return back to Atlantis World without sharing anything about their identity with us directly.  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? We\u2019ll be able to verifiably onboard 50,000+ (potentially, after the pilot, up to millions) of true, real people into Optimism ecosystem whilst educating them and offsetting some emergency living costs of Ukrainians during the war time.  Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? We\u2019ve received retroactive OP grant from OP Labs for building OP City ft. Optimism onboarding quests, ecosystem clubhouses & integrations. Our core contributors also applied for OptimismUA grant https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-optimismua/4970 Number of OP tokens requested: 250,000 $OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? As a fully bootstrapped project, it\u2019s hard for us to provide monetary co-incentives (even if we\u2019d love to, as we\u2019re living in Ukraine ourselves), yet we\u2019re coming up with creative ways we could add even more value, such as  leveraging our existing partner media network to amplify the campaign (we know most of the biggest Ukrainian media companies, even ForbesUA office is directly adjacent to our office in largest Eastern European innovation park) we\u2019d collaborate with The Ministry of Digital Transformation to notify Ukrainians about such a powerful campaign - we expect hundreds of thousands (perhaps, even millions) of impressions from the campaign awareness posts ft. Optimism! leveraging our non-profit connections from our humanitarian efforts @ Unchain Fund (400k+ Ukrainians received humanitarian aid), including a network of 3k+ volunteers, 50k+ women\u2019s support request, etc. asking our strong, crypto-curious community of 2,500+ women @ WomenCryptoGuida (Ukrainian web3 women network we\u2019ve co-founded with ELLE magazine) to spread the campaign across their network. \u2026 and more!  Proposal for token distribution How will the OP tokens be distributed? 100% - 250,000 $OP  user onboarding incentives, 5 $OP per user completing onboarding flow inside of OP City total: 50,000 (!) real people onboarded into Optimism ecosystem until EOY (2023).  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? 50,000 Ukrainians to be successfully onboarded in pilot by end of 2023. Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable. Milestones  20% grant payout after successful testing of incentivised OP onboarding integration inside of Atlantis World ft. Diia integration (so we\u2019ll have enough funds to start the incentivised onboarding campaign) 20% grant payout after successfully onboarding first 7k Ukrainians with $OP incentives 20% grant payout after successfully onboarding 17k Ukrainians with $OP incentives 20% grant payout after successfully onboarding 27k Ukrainians with $OP incentives 20% grant payout after successfully onboarding 37k Ukrainians with $OP incentives  Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? We\u2019ve previously created OptimismUA proposal to support long-term growth of Optimism ecosystem in Ukraine, and we believe combining our community building efforts @ OptimismUA with incentivised onboarding (w/ sybil resistance) will create an unprecedented, real adoption of blockchain ecosystem web3 has ever seen before. NOTE: this is only pilot proposal for onboarding 50,000 real people. If proven successful and sustainable, we\u2019d love to scale this experience to onboard millions of real users into Optimism. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability: (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) We\u2019re open to deploy OP multisig with OP Labs / Foundation / ecosystem highly trusted stakeholders being multisig signers & even start a working group collaborating on this specific initiative (&potentially upcoming ones, after the successful pilot).
