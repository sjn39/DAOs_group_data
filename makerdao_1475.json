Every added CU takes time and energy that could be spent on other CUs or projects within the protocol. With the recent discussion of increased oversight and potential KPIs for CUs, I thought we should get a rough idea of what upper limit we should aim for. Conventional wisdom is that a manager can handle 7-10 direct reports. Someone overseeing multiple departments would generally handle 3-5. While Maker delegates are not managers, I do think the 7-10 number is a good rough heuristic. It would be helpful to know how the general community feels about the subject. Note: This is independent of budget considerations. This is strictly an organizational question.    How many CUs can delegates effectively oversee?  1-5 6-10 11-15 16-25 26+     0 voters     ",

I would actually be tempted to push back on the premise of the question: is it really true that delegates \u2018manage\u2019 CUs, at all? In my mental model of Maker, that\u2019s the job of CU Facilitators. Delegates have enough on their plate needing to be across each function of Maker, for the purpose of casting regular votes on everything from RWA to stability fee changes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s practical or desirable for delegates to also serve as day-to-day middle management for CUs. ",

I don\u2019t think that this function necessitates \u2018management\u2019 per se (arguably the latter undermines the former) and agree with @CodeKnight\u2019s change of terminology to \u2018oversee\u2019. That better reflects the dynamic, at least in my view. In terms of coordinating activity across CUs, that is a little different to the accountability question and I guess my answer would depend on the details and nature of the collaboration. CUs may well (and do) collaborate between themselves all the time on low-level issues, but you\u2019re right that delegates likely have a role in directing larger-scale activities and strategic functions that include multiple CUs.
