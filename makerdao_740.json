                    "content": "Hello MakerDAO While I have been working on things in the background.   I have not made much progress and there are a number of concerns springing up that I think are capturing attention but not getting significant traction. With this post I hope to lay out the issues and to present for discussion what I see as the issues that lay underneath the issues. Primary issue: Maker collateral custody centralization. USDC, wBTC, USDP each account for over 500M worth of collateral.   As far as I know the backing to these are controlled by a single centralized entity which means if by accident or purpose >500M worth of collateral backing could be removed in an instant, and because of the nature of the DAO has little to no actual legal recourse should such an event happen. Maker (MKR) market cap is now < 2B and from my seat based on the Market cap to surplus recovery during BT (6M DAI was covered by selling 2% MKR at a cost to the MKR market cap of about 400M or 60% MC loss).   Put simply thinking that flopping MKR to cover a 500M hole in collateral for DAI is a \u2018best case, here is wishing with you\u2019 scenario. I think some people understand this is a significant and growing threat, the effect on MKR cap, and DAI adoption NOT understood at all. Put simply collateral risk is centralizing at the vault level.  Worse DAI in being over collateralized is rapidly approaching at best a 100% collateralized due to the PSMs.   With the tin/tout being 0/0 Maker makes ZERO return on parties laying off their collateral in exchange for DAI. Solutions all involve one form or another of growth.  Try to get more decentralized collateral on-board (well oracle costs are causing MakerDAO to offload collateral creating an increasing collateral concentration risk) Bring on institutional vaults.  This again centralizes counter party risk because instead of having 100\u2019s or thousands of autonomous agents managing risk on a finer grain Maker instead has maybe 10 players responsible for over 50% of the collateral assets.  This means (as we have seen in the past week) a single player can shift their assets away from Maker and significant decrease our revenues.  This will eventually be seen in the surplus buffer dropping vs. rising. RWF.   Frankly to date RWF hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. Nor does it appear to be materializing in a way that helps us at all with risk.  In the loosest sense practical concerns are causing our RWF players to want large vaults that they manage because doing deals for specific collateral 10M or even 50M at a time simply won\u2019t scale to B\u2019s much less a T DAI borrowed.   If Maker brings on even 1 player and gives them a 500M DC we then centralize again our exposure to a centralized player.  Frankly this started hitting me both as a Maker delegate, and as a Maker User who is seeing the only vault he uses (the ETHUSDC Uni V2) shrinking in use and looking at the likelihood of having to end up paying his DAI back and closing his vault.   Effectively being pushed out of being one of the slowly dwindling few autonomous agents that could act to buy DAI should the PEG ever break below 1, much less owning MKR, and being a delegate governor. My concerns here are not just for MKR holders but DAI holders and what I see as a continuing and ongoing centralization of the players in the protocol to large very centralized ones and if for any reason the collateral assets becomes impaired this becomes an existential threat not just to Maker and DAI but ultimately could ripple across the entire DeFI space with a contagion effect. In my mind the appeal of Maker and DAI was that DAI was backed by a liquidity value that was liquid and with a greater value than the amount of DAI minted.  In the end any collateral shortfalls by MKR market cap itself.   When I first supported (or floated I honestly can\u2019t remember) the pitch to add USDC to back DAI it was strictly as an emergency source of stable collateral to mint DAI during the week of BlackThursday to accomodate sourcing DAI for MKR flops to cover a 6M DAI hole.   This has since been transformed from a large USDC vault with a 102% LR and some low SF to many PSMs with now 5B and a fee of zero to exchange. Many people have been bringing proposals forward to offload PSM stables but I don\u2019t see many people talking about how at 100% collateral backing to DAI and 0 fees there is basically no value headroom to offloading this capital. Lets look at an example.   Lets say we offload even 1B worth of USDC and just want to have a Trust manage this as USD cash - sitting there in case Maker gets that 500M exogenous event (say USDP locks and all the PSMs are rapidly exhausted) and the DAI peg overnight drops to .95?   Then such a player with 1B in USD cash - could in theory bring this to bear on the markets buying DAI and pocketing as much as 50M in profit (which in theory would be taxed and also have charges). The point here is that the above player becomes a single centralized player that as a trust would act on behalf of governance to act (and can be programmed like software to act with those funds).  But the real question becomes how long would it take them to act?   And if nothing happens how much does it cost to have this centralized structure simply holding 1B USD to be there \u2018ready to act\u2019\u2026 The above player would ofc look like an arranger, or one of a number of RWA players in legal structure, but basically take on a task for a fee to manage collateral to maintain the PEG.   The Maker protocol would then bear a cost for this structure to manage this for us. So here we are left with questions.  What is the latency to apply such collateral? Is this using one kind of centralization to off load risk of another kind of centralization Does it cost more or less to have more or less centralized players with more or less DC. (i.e. take 4B and spread 400M across 10 managers cost more than 1B across 4?  which is better or worse) Does having an arranger model where we have single arrangers with 1B vaults (even institutions) actually create its own form of centralization risk that puts the protocol at risk.   Is having single deal or chunk deals of 100-200M simply not practical to manage this risk and then is MakerDAO forced to centralize Is there any other approach that could mitigate this growing centralization risk, more D3Ms Maker finally taking the step to grow a treasury of assets we can borrow DAI against as a secondary backstop before MKR is flopped - that is liquid and not centralized (say uniswap, Guni, and other assets in defi that has reduced price and value volatility that maybe can also earn return while providing DAI liquidity in case of losses).  I give an example here that if Maker has $10M in a UNIv2 ETHUSDC vault over the past year we would have earned 20% in return (my return is at 22% over 10 months and yes the value fluctuates but even 2K to 4K ETH only causes a 40-45% swing in my LP value) and could have borrowed DAI to pay back that 6M DAI SB hole without flopping 20K MKR that we paid what 50M DAI to buy back. Frankly I am growing tired or debating smaller issues and think while Maker liquidity is important (I am strong proponent of MKR-DAI v2 LP for a vast amount of reasons) but I honestly think Maker needs to focus on one single issue at this point. How in the heck is MakerDAO going to not just grow DAI, but do it so that we don\u2019t drive into a centralization trap that effectively destroys Maker, and DAI at the same time. Right now revenues are dropping and quite rapidly could find ourselves in a situation where the surplus starts dropping rapidly and we may have to flop MKR just to pay our huge expenses. Maker has a lot of great minds and I think before we get into a bad situation we need to face the biggest issue described above. I want to make a final point and while I discuss 6s and pinging @mrabino1 because I am going to refer to discussions I want to point out something that we need to discuss when it comes to RWA as well as offloading our growing stablecoin backing to DAI. I asked Matt whether 6s would be able to find capital to purchase DAI should the PSMs be emptied and Maker was left with SF paying vaults with borrows on to maintain the PEG.  Matt assured me that should be DAI peg even drift 100-200 basis points he would be taking advantage of the opportunity to buy DAI via using other bank facilities to help maintain the PEG. Now because I pinged Matt on this (because I want him to share with the DAO his answer and correct my understanding if I misrepresent).  But when I said - how much capital could you bring - my impression here was that Matt could (it would take time) bring to bear a significant fraction if not all of his loan value to bear to buy DAI back if he can earn 100-200 or more basis points of profit.   To be sure this would take time, but the mere fact that 6s could have 5-10% of his loan value ready to buy DAI should we drop significantly below PEG I consider to be one of the greatest reasons to get 6s on line - not tomorrow or today but yesterday AND to get a couple others on line with 50-100M yesterday not tomorrow. I also want to hear from Centrifuge and Monetalis and 6s of course and RWF itself on not just approach to get these going BUT how much cash each of these players can bring to bear to buy DAI (and what DAI price below PEG they will deploy) so that the DAO can seriously consider how to start spreading this centralization risk around. I want hard, concise proposals on how Maker gets out of this centralization quagmire, both by the RWF players themselves (could we have a couple diff few hundred million facilities so we break up the legal and operational risks in different structures).   Do we end up hugely centralized if we allow a few players with vaults with 1B or 10B - how does MakerDAO handle this, how are Arrangers going to help us?    In the end I really want to hear from risk and any CUs on how to spread this risk, and really how much it is going to cost because I believe we really need to revist getting some profit from these PSMs (on both sides of the spread) to providing this service (+/- 2bps, 3, 5 what?) There is no poll, just a request for discussion on a topic I see becoming more and more important every day.  At some point Maker is going to have to take the risk bullet and move on some activities not just to grow, but to spread and lay off the growing centralization risk. Thank you for your time and I look forward to the discussion, ",

As you mentioned, our expenses are only going up quickly and our revenues are going down. 67% of the balance sheet is in stablecoins that are yielding nothing (or not much in the case of GUNI). Your point about DAI below the peg is currently quite remote with 67% in stablecoin. It would be also solved by Intra DeFi stablecoin issuers money-market. So we have $6B to put at work. Anything below $1B is a waste of focus. So Institutional vaults and short-term bonds. ",

But for sure we would get an inferior product.   5bps on 5B is 2.5M DAI that isn\u2019t chump change.  Even a 2bps spread on 5B would have netted us 1M. So an inferior product.  Seriously.  The PSM is considered a product?   Have you bothered to look at the size of the transactions going across there and the fact that it is just a free service to load up Maker with USDC and providing the users DAI.  Everyone else has to pay to get DAI (i.e. vault holders who are the ones paying MakerDAO bills here btw)     SebVentures:  Centralization is an issue, but not the biggest one right now (especially because not much can be done).   Really?  Not much can be done. We can put up at least a small fee on both sides of the trade to earn some much needed revenues across all PSMs (this also boosts all GUNIv2 fees helping our vaults there).   We can work on making more D3M\u2019s Compound DAI AND USDC for example could earn us at least 100-150bps on what a few hundred million.  This also isn\u2019t chump change and at least moves us in an easy direction to moving these PSM gorilla\u2019s that are not getting smaller.     SebVentures:  Your point about DAI below the peg is currently quite remote with 67% in stablecoin. It would be also solved by Intra DeFi stablecoin issuers money-market .   Quite remote.  You mean only an ES away.   Which as of writing only costs about 180M worth of MKR to execute. BTW:    People keep thrashing around on bonds here.   So we take a straight up interest rate risk if we go long term and RWF is still thrashing around on how to build a bridge that doesn\u2019t centralize the legal interests of the protocol.  If we go short term bonds we are only talking <20bps and costs to liquidity cycle (depending) where as if we could get 100bps on .5B via D3M in compound (USDC and DAI) this straight up earns us 10-20bps on 5B (via investing .5B to get 100-200bps return).   The only risk is this .5B being locked (say on compound).   100-200BPS is only 5-10M/yr or .4-.8M/month - again not chump change here and we understand the risks on Compound and probably can execute this far faster and cheaper than anything Real World at this point. (IMHO). ",
