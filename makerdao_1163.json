This amendment has brought in substantial changes that will need to be considered when making a budget proposal. What follows is a summary of the main changes.  Main Changes  Budget Submission Windows This amendment introduced Budget Submission Windows. Budget requests (MIP40c3 subproposals) can only be submitted quarterly on: March, June, September, and November. (Note that there\u2019s no December Governance Cycle.) This restriction applies both to ratified Core Units and to Core Units to-be, effectively keeping new Core Units from being submitted for ratification outside of the Budget Submission Windows.  Budget Start and End Dates Budgets have now a maximum duration of 12 months and cannot start later than three months after they have been formally submitted, i.e., budgets must satisfy these conditions:  Budget Start Date <= three months after Budget\u2019s Formal Submission. Budget End Date <= Start Date + 12 months.   Budget Composition Budget requests are now required to be of higher resolution by specifying:  How revenue growth and/or the potential for improvement in operational efficiency will be increased. How the Core Unit could guarantee viable business if operating Bear/Superbear/Bull context. A timeline for specific deliverables. Etc.   Transparency, Return of Funds, Unwinding In the interest of increased transparency, budgets are now required to:  List expenses by time. Specify percentage of budget going to ongoing or one-time expenses. Disclose headcount. Include a variance analysis in the case of budget increases greater than 10%. Etc.  Additionally, Core Units are now required to return all funds (with qualifications) in excess of three months of budget. For more details please see MIP40c4. They must also define how they are to be wound down in the event of a Governance vote to defund them, with accompanying rationale (period, use of funds, return of funds). See here.  MIP40c3 Subproposal Parameters Ratification Polls for MIP40c3 subproposals no longer use binary voting; instead, they now use ranked-choice voting\u2014specifically they provide these options:  A: Approve existing budget only (business as usual). B: Approve increased budget. C: Reject budget. D: Abstain.   We will soon be hosting a Know Your MIP public call to discuss about this amendment. Date is to be confirmed. We have identified some areas that need clarifications and are planning on posting a MIP4c3 amendment in the near future. For any questions/comments please reach out to me, @blimpa, or @sebix.

With that said, the start of the frozen period isn\u2019t until Wednesday and proposal authors may wish to consider the support for this amendment from MKR holders when making their final edits. For proposals going forward GovAlpha and Strategic Finance will be working together to ensure compliance and assist proposal authors. EDIT: The grace period for the submission window will be extended until September to account for existing CUs with budgets set to expire before then, and newly applying CUs who may have budgeted for a sooner submission window. All new budgets should comply with other aspects of the MIP40 amendments, but GOV-001 and SF-001 will work with authors to help achieve this goal. ",

Looks like you wouldn\u2019t be the only one affected by this gap either, and there are incubating Core Units that would have to readjust too with such a narrow grace period. After talking with @strat-fin-core-unit, we\u2019re making the call to extend the grace period for budget submissions until September. This will give applicants time to try out the new format without waiting longer than they might have been anticipating when making their budget plans for this year. So any new budget applications should follow the new guidelines, but GovAlpha and Strategic Finance will work with applicants during the grace period rather than enforcing the letter of the changes to the most strict degree. If there are questions, comments, or concerns I encourage them to be aired in this thread, though my DMs are always open if clarification is being sought before making a public post. ",

As much as I appreciate granting exceptions (I\u2019be been voicing the shortcomings of this proposal for some time, and this would definitely benefit me) I disagree with the very principle and precedent we\u2019re establishing. We have literally created a rule that makes harder the onboarding or modification of budgets for core units, and then we grant exceptions for existing core units.

                    "content": "Definitely appreciate the viewpoint and it\u2019s a decision I struggled with, but I think providing an extended grace period is the most prudent decision given the circumstances. Some key points:  The exception is not just being made for existing CUs, but for new applicants as well. The proposal author did not intend to immediately put a stop to Budget requests until September, and was under the impression that the grace period lasting until September was already codified. MIPs often have incomplete components and undefined processes attached to them that aren\u2019t fully apparent until someone tries to use them. Despite attempts from GovAlpha to get more feedback on this process, the direct conflict of these issues were not addressed during the RFC period. MKR holders retain the right to vote down any budget requests before September if the budget submission window was a key factor to their MIP40 amendment support. Doing a stop gap measure guarantees at least 2 votes would need to take place and that outside parties would need to get involved (SPF structure) or the further eroding of the intended Signal process would need to take place.  Governance has a duty to facilitate community proposals. If a mission critical core unit was left without a budget due to this unintended issue we would be forced to make an exception. Rather than apply a narrow exception window that favors entrenched Core Units, this solution was selected to apply the rules fairly and give the community time to figure out the impact of the recent amendments. I welcome further discourse on this subject, and hope this provides a little clarity on why this grace period was put forward. ",
