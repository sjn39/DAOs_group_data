GnosisDAO  Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  GNO is the governance token of GnosisDAO, which was launched November 23rd 2020. The GnosisDAO is giving GNO holders direct stake in Gnosis\u2019 strategic decision making and fund management. Via token-weighted voting, GNO holders may participate in core roadmap decisions of Gnosis\u2019 core product lines. Funding of projects and other initiatives are made available only for proposals approved by a majority of GNO token holders. GnosisDAO has been guiding development over Gnosis\u2019 core products, including:   The Gnosis Chain: a stable payments EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions. The chain uses a unique dual-token model; xDai is a stable token used for transactions, payments, and fees, and Proof of Stake protection will be provided by GNO with the consensus-layer Gnosis Beacon Chain.   The Gnosis Safe Multisig (currently a spin-off rebranded to Safe): a platform for digital asset management used by MakerDAO, Ethfinex, Synthetix, Uniswap, 1inch, AAVE, Balancer and many more. Currently holding over $107B in total value, Safe is a leading smart contract account solution for the Ethereum ecosystem.   Cowswap (currently a spin-off): The first trading interface built on top of CoW Protocol. CowSwap is a Meta DEX aggregator that allows you to buy and sell tokens using gasless orders that are settled peer-to-peer among its users, or into any on-chain liquidity source while providing MEV protection.

Over 20 months  Provide a brief history of the project.  Gnosis was founded in 2015 by Stefan George and Martin K\u00f6ppelmann as part of ConsenSys. In April 2017, Gnosis raised funds and spun out of ConsenSys to become an independent company. Gnosis has since built and supported a variety of products contributing to the Ethereum infrastructure. Please find a timeline of the major milestones of Gnosis\u2019 core products here:   2015: Development begins on Gnosis\u2019 prediction markets platform, which later became the Conditional Tokens Framework. A first iteration launched on Ethereum mainchain one week after Ethereum\u2019s launch  Feb. 2017: Launch of Gnosis Multi-signature Wallet, which was quickly trusted by projects such as Golem and Aragon to securely manage their ICO treasuries  May 2019: Gnosis \u201cawakens\u201d community-governed organization 1 DXdao, which has since separated into a distinct entity that maintains a close collaboration developing interfaces for our underlying open-source protocols, such as Omen 1 and Mesa   December 2019: launch of the Gnosis Safe, the successor of the Gnosis Multisig. It is now storing more than 15 billion USD, including more than 2% of the total ETH supply  July 2020: 5 years of building on prediction markets culminate in the release of Omen, DXdao\u2019s decentralized prediction market platform powered by Gnosis\u2019 Conditional Tokens Framework  April 2020: Gnosis\u2019 DEX Gnosis Protocol v1 launches. It has hosted many IDOs for projects including mStable, API3 and many more. Gnosis started working on an advanced IDO protocol that will offer more functionalities and flexibility. Additionally, Gnosis began working on Gnosis Protocol V2, a Meta Dex Aggregator which matches the orders of retail traders with each other and channels those orders that can\u2019t be directly matched to underlying on-chain AMMs for execution (more details here)  May 2020: OpenEthereum (formerly Parity Ethereum) begins a new phase of stewardship by Gnosis, with support from the Ethereum Foundation  November 2020: Gnosis decentralizes governance and decision-making to GnosisDAO 2, a prediction market-driven collective  April 2021: Gnosis Protocol v2 launches. The first live UI is CowSwap, the next one will be the Balancer swap interface, which is integrating Gnosis Protocol v2 to offer their users better prices and more security. Within the first week of being live, CowSwap already ranked 7th in number of distinct traders across all Ethereum DEXes  December 2021: A token merger (between the STAKE and GNO tokens) took place together with a rebranding of the xDai Stable Chain (born in October, 2018) to \u201cGnosis Chain\u201d.  January 2022: Partnership agreement between GnosisDAO and BalancerDAO, including a ~$7M token swap, joint marketing efforts and stage 3 development of Balancer-Gnosis-Protocol Integration, to allow traders on Balancer to always get the best prices available on-chain -or better- if CoWs are found, eventually leading to better prices for all traders of CowSwap as trades are batched and a higher trade frequency leads to increased chances for coincidence of wants  January 2022: Treasury analysis and allocation services by Karpatkey DAO   February 2022: Incentives program launch. Initial GNO disbursement from the GnosisDAO to improve rewards for high priority protocols: Core Infrastructure, Bridges and Money Markets  March 2022: Funding of the Gnosis Guild team\u2019s operations and startup costs, to develop the Zodiac DAO tools at a total of USD ~$2.9 Million equivalent  April 2022: Spin-off of the Gnosis Safe project from Gnosis, creation of a SAFE Token to govern the Gnosis Safe ecosystem and infrastructure through the establishment of an independent SafeDAO and foster the Gnosis Safe ecosystem  May 2022: Partnership with Erigon, an entirely re-architected implementation of Ethereum, to provide a faster, more modular, and more optimized implementation of Ethereum. This brings significant benefits to the node operators and impacts the dynamics of the network, with much lower disk footprint, faster sync speed and enhanced modularity.  May 2022: Investment of ~268M in the Gnosis Builders\u2019 growth initiative for the Gnosis Chain, to support developers and projects building on the Gnosis Chain with investments, grants, technical support, business development and marketing.  June 2022: Partnership with Nethermind, Gnosis Chain\u2019s main client, to further improve its deployment  August 2022: Funding of Bootnode as a core contributor team, to contribute with engineering and development services to the Gnosis DAO ecosystem by building a hands-on autonomous team with relevant experience in multiple disciplines that will focus on growing the GC ecosystem adoption.  Gnosis is also very committed in supporting the MakerDAO ecosystem, mainly: Since November 2019, Gnosis provides core infrastructure for the stability of Maker/DAI by running a light MakerDAO oracle. When the MakerDAO system was at risk in March 2020 (Black Thursday event), Gnosis opened a new CDP with 30k ETH, selling the 600k created DAI to increase the supply of DAI to support its peg:  ETH deposit transaction  Minting of DAI transaction  Depositing DAI into GPv1 DEX transaction    Chart1600\u00d7796 140 KB   Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.   Gnosis Github GNO token contract (Github) Gnosis Blog (hosted on Medium) Website Gnosis Chain World  Asset Information  What type of asset is it? (e.g. store of value, currency, commodity, capital asset, governance token etc.)  Governance token  How is the asset used and does it give any rights to holders? (e.g. financial claims, dividends, governance rights)  The asset is used in Gnosis Chain validators and as a governance token (governance rights can be exercised even if the token is locked in a validator of the GC)  What is the market cap for the asset?  $403,319,542  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  Uniswap (v2 & v3), Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Balancer (v1 & v2), Bitfinex, Sushiswap, Bancor, Swapr (Xdai), Curve, Bittrex, HitBTC, CoinEx 9.a  Provide exchange data on market liquidity, volume and order book depth.  24 hr volume: 0.8M Order Book Depth: 1.03M   Is the asset settled on chain (trustless) or off chain (trusted)?  On chain (trustless)   If offchain (trusted) settlement: describe what are the involved entities, process and estimated time. N/A   List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed collateral type.   https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-eth/gno-eth  List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed collateral type.   The GnosisDAO treasury KarpatkeyDAO Gnosis Builders  Business Questions  What is/are the expected use case(s) of the Dai generated by the vault?  The DAI generated by the vault will be used to boost the development of the Gnosis Chain, fostering protocols\u2019 expansion within it, increasing its attractiveness to users across the entire DeFi ecosystem by improving its infrastructure, keeping a very low gas fee, and keeping it fast and secure. The DAI will be efficiently managed, keeping the minimum necessary liquid, to meet the previously described goals while taking advantage of liquidity farming, low risk carry trade and other investment opportunities with the rest of the DAI which doesn\u2019t need to be used immediately.  What is the amount of Dai expected to be generated against the collateral and what is the timeline? Is there a commitment on a minimum amount of Dai to be generated?  We will generate at least 30M DAI within the first year. We expect that number to continuously increase as the Gnosis Chain evolves and our treasury management team handles tokenomics aiming to consistently keep GNO at a healthy price level.  Also, we\u2019ll make significant communication efforts to spread the word once GNO can be used to mint DAI, to maximize DAI minting from decentralized GNO holders.  What are the strategic benefits for MakerDAO in onboarding the collateral?  GnosisDAO\u2019s strategic growth strategy includes positioning DAI as the stablecoin of choice within the Gnosis Chain. Part of this strategy includes the rebranding of XDAI to DAI, and joint marketing efforts with all the protocols present in the GC to attract users by pitching the competitive advantages of the network, including the following:  Fast transaction times (5 seconds) & low transaction fees (500 tx for $0.01) Digital cash: A stable chain is ideal for real world value exchange where 1 xDai = 1 US Dollar A stable token for transactions & gas fees A green, energy-efficient and ecologically aware blockchain network (10x carbon neutral since 2021 by teaming up with Offsetra for a carbon-negative initiative. Gnosis Chain is now offsetting 10x more carbon than the chain produces) Permissionless delegated Proof-Of-Stake based consensus with public POSDAO Wide-ranging Community Support (see xDai Validator Organizations) Growing ecosystem designed to support stable person-to-person transactions, micro transactions, conference currencies, community currencies, DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, games and more Full-featured BlockScout Explorer (GnosisScan by Etherscan about to launch) On-chain, decentralized Random Number Generator Smart Contract, DApp & toolset compatibility with other Ethereum-based chains like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, BSC and others Experiencing the magic of crypto for the first time!  There are currently over 1500 DAOs in the GC, with extensive DAO tooling at their disposal  Circles UBI and Proof of Humanity Social dapps like POAP, giveh, clr.fund Analytics: Dune Analytics, Tenderly, Dappquery Games like Dark Forest, Cometh Privacy: tornado.cash Oracles: Kleros and Chainlink A full set of open finance primitives (AMM and non-AMM dexes, lending markets, derivatives, etc.): 1inch, Curve, Cowswap, Uniswap (including v3), Sushiswap, etc.  The GC is the 3rd most decentralized chain in the ecosystem. We\u2019re working to make the chain increasingly attractive for developers, users and validators (with minimum barriers to entry with a minimum stake of 1 GNO, a very easy technical setup, non-punitive uptime requirements and collaboration with Dappnode and Avado. Currently we have over 100k validators). Regarding developers, development on GC is easy and intuitive for Ethereum developers. GC is an EVM chain, and smart contracts can be written and deployed in exactly the same way simply by setting a different RPC endpoint. Any contract that works on the Ethereum mainnet can be redeployed to the Gnosis chain. Transaction costs are minimized, and all fees and transactions are paid with a single token: XDAI. Many tools supporting Ethereum development are compatible with GC, including:  TheGraph Tenderly Remix OpenZeppelin BlockNative Gnosis Safe MultiSig Dune Analytics  We have been working hand in hand with Maker\u2019s Growth CU to make sure this proposal is mutually beneficial, meeting MakerDAO\u2019s needs. Also, GnosisDAO will continue to use stETH to mint DAI. We have a very large position (>71k wsETH), equivalent to ~$126M at current market prices. Legal Questions  What are the legal risks associated with the tokens?  N/A  (Optional) Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  Please refer to question 21.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. \\  N/A  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  N/A  Is issuance of the asset decentralized (trustless) or centralized (trusted)?  Centralized 21.a. If centralized/trusted: by which legal entity, type of entity and jurisdiction? Gnosis Ltd., a private limited company incorporated in Gibraltar, created and issued GNO as part of its token sale in 2017, which was carried out in compliance with Gibraltar laws and regulations. No further GNO will be minted. Technical Questions  Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.   Gnosis Safe: Both formal verification as well as multiple security audits have been conducted on the Gnosis Safe Contracts (Link) Gnosis Protocol: Audit Report 1  Prediction Markets: Prediction Markets V1 contracts (link), Conditional Tokens contracts (link 1)   Has the token (and/or supporting protocol) been formally verified?  Yes, here\u2019s a link to the audits of the Gnosis Chain and related infrastructure. The GNO token audit can be found here (original extended audit in this link).  Does the asset follow a token standard? (E.g. ERC20, ERC721, ERC1400)  ERC20  Is the asset, or asset balances, controlled by a central actor, or group of actors (e.g. through a multisig, or DAO)?  It\u2019s controlled by GnosisDAO  Does the token have whitelist or blacklist functions? If so, what is the process for utilization and what stakeholders are involved?  No, it doesn\u2019t.  Can the token implementation be upgraded/changed? If so, what is the process and what stakeholders are involved?  No, it can\u2019t.  Does the token contain rebasing logic?  No, it doesn\u2019t. ",

However - IMO the real reason to onboard GNO for Maker should be this: Out of the top 20 chains, Gnosis Chain is the only one where DAI is the dominant stablecoin. DAI is not only the dominant stable coin on the network - it is the native token that people can use to pay for gas. This makes a big difference for new user onboarding. We can see many ways to have a synergistic relationship with Maker and getting GNO onboarded is just a small first one. Just to mention 2 highlights of Gnosis Chain (GC) beyond DAI as a native token: a) ETH2 consensus with already >100k validators (merge soon) b) A clear path (and proof of concept) of how those >100k validators will secure bridges to Ethereum by running a light client of GC on Ethereum using zkSNARK.

Is there a commitment on a minimum amount of Dai to be generated?  We will generate at least 30M DAI within the first year. We expect that number to continuously increase as the Gnosis Chain evolves and our treasury management team handles tokenomics aiming to consistently keep GNO at a healthy price level. Also, we\u2019ll make significant communication efforts to spread the word once GNO can be used to mint DAI, to maximize DAI minting from decentralized GNO holders.   Aside from the obvious synergies, this is a strong business case to make. Have other GNO whales shown interest in participating? This is another example of when bracket pricing might be applicable for when vault is below 30M in DAI vs when its above. ",

Allowing GNO to be used as collateral is a part of a more extensive partnership that will boost the usage of DAI and the creation of a subDAO. We\u2019ve held several meetings with your risk team, applied adjustments, and increased liquidity until they felt comfortable. The collateral liquidation ratio is 350%, which is highly risk-averse compared to any other collateral type. Also, we have committed to keeping the DAI minted above 75% of the ceiling limit at all times. DAI minted won\u2019t be expended. Instead, we\u2019ll use it to provide liquidity to a 100% collateralized EURO-backed token in a more significant effort of boosting the most solid EURO project up to date: Monerium. Our current total holdings are $166,128,951 (at current bear market prices), and we will continue to use stETH to mint DAI. We have a substantial position (>71k wsETH), equivalent to ~$126M at current market prices. GnosisDAO has always been very committed to supporting MakerDAO:  Since November 2019, Gnosis has provided core infrastructure for the stability of Maker/DAI by running a light MakerDAO oracle. When the MakerDAO system was at risk in March 2020 (Black Thursday event), Gnosis opened a new CDP with 30k ETH, selling the 600k created DAI to increase the supply of DAI to support its peg.  ETH deposit transaction  Minting of DAI transaction  Depositing DAI into GPv1 DEX transaction     The DAI generated by the vault will be used to boost the development of the Gnosis Chain, fostering protocols\u2019 expansion within it. We\u2019ll increase its attractiveness to users across the entire DeFi ecosystem by improving its infrastructure, keeping a very low gas fee, and keeping it fast and secure. The DAI will be efficiently managed, keeping the minimum necessary liquid, to meet the previously described goals while taking advantage of liquidity farming, low-risk carry trade, and other investment opportunities with the rest of the DAI which doesn\u2019t need to be used immediately. Finally, I\u2019d like to let you know that we are aligned with Rune\u2019s endgame plan, as part of the agreement to onboard GNO is the compromise to bring more ETH (or derivatives) to the protocol as you have been doing. Gnosis and Maker are aligned in terms of Ethereum and DAI adoption, and we have shown good vault management in the last year and will avoid liquidation at all costs. ",

There are definitely risks associated with, but at the same time, the Maker protocol has been quite flexible in chainging its collateral strategy if needed even with partners. For example, there was a time when yearn\u2019s strategy itself was based on Maker\u2019s vault and that helped to mint a significant amount of Dai which was able to accomplished via collaboration between two protocols. Now especially as the bear market continues, YFI based vault has seen less use and there was recently a discussion about it. The same for many other collateral types that have been offboarded. So from the Maker protocol\u2019s side, if Gnosis team doesn\u2019t follow its commitment then the governance can restart the discussion about it. ",

If MakerDAO has to spend any governance time monitoring or discussing it, then the collateral is a net loss. YFI has the same issue. MakerDAO uses the same decision making process for offboarding 200 million dollar collaterals as 10 million dollar ones, so can end up spending disproportionate time and effort on smaller projects. This is one area I am hopeful that metaDAOs can address. ",

I don\u2019t think Dai minted ever was above 75% and currently at 50%. 2.5 million Dai minted out of 5 million debt ceiling.

Maintain no less than 75% of GnosisDAO stablecoin borrowing activities with highly liquid assets excluding possible recursive farming activity in lending markets in MCD. GnosisDAO will conduct the majority of its stablecoin borrowing volume with Maker. Utilize the GNO-A debt ceiling as soon as possible, Maker prefers the majority of available debt ceiling to be utilized at all times.  GnosisDAO MCD vault activity can be found here. According to the latest weekly report published by Karpatkey on the state of their portfolio, they indeed conduct more than 75% of stablecoin borrowing activity inside MCD, which is the most important financial aspect of this agreement. Nevertheless, preferably, the current DC on GNO-A could be utilized more. While we appreciate their very high collateralization of the position - currently above 1900%, we also assume they will likely mint additional debt in coming days, considering recent favourable price dynamics which allow for safe additional borrowing.  1600\u00d7895 186 KB  In the case nothing changes in this regard in some reasonable time period, Risk or MOMC will likely propose to lower the DC closer to current exposure, in order to minimise risk. In regards to other aspects of the agreement - to further increase synergies and collaboration between the two DAOs, the tweet came with a surprise to me personally, but other CUs can perhaps comment more on the topic.
