We are here with the most recent information on what has been going on with our favorite algorithm over the past few weeks! If you want to check our instance you can find it here. Haven\u2019t you signed up yet? For details on opting in, see Opting in to Sourcecred/Wth is SourceCred?. Please leave your comments below if there is anything else you would like to see added.   Announcements Payouts will be out next Friday! We will distribute 12,500 DAI based on 17,827 Cred generated last month. Delegate SourceCred payouts are also going to be issued next Friday! We will be distributing 5,000 DAI based on 6,298 Cred generated. Delegates can track their activity here. Last week we had some technical issues running the instance so this post was delayed. Everything is fixed now and working! This time we will review the last 3 weeks instead of 2 as we usually do. We will do user activations every Wednesday from now on. In this way, we believe the opt-in process will be more organized. Please remember that to activate an account, it must have clear signs of activity such as received likes and posts made. Navigate to the DAI Accounts tab  of the Maker instance to see your current DAI balance and total DAI earned.  Newcomers Please welcome @M.Bertuccio @Dilip @Freakytainment  and @WaterLily. They are our newest members of the program so If you see them out there, say hi!  Cred Stats A total of 10,018 Cred have been generated in the last three weeks, with 126 topics and 1131 posts created. We\u2019ve had three weeks with the lowest production this year. As seen in both charts, activity and Cred generation have reached their lowest levels of the year, breaking the floor of 3,500 Cred scores per week. The second chart highlights the trend and illustrates how the three-week activity levels were consistently lower than last year.  785\u00d7507 21.6 KB   771\u00d7544 11.6 KB  Top 5 Categories Below are the top 5 categories of the period, ranked by Cred generated.
