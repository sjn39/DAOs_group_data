                    "content": "Hey all, YFI-A vault type debt ceiling is maxed out and the community needs to decide what to do next. I noted here that we already need to increase fees from the current 4% to at least 7% according to risk premium calculations based on our model. If we were to increase DC for another 10m or more, fees might need to be slowly increased into double digit territory. Although we estimated maximum DC to be 46m DAI, the current structure of vaults is seen as very risky as there is one vault with 11.5m DAI debt that has only 204% collateralization (14% price drop and it gets liquidated). However this vault seems to be quite sophisticated and avoided liquidations a few times last week. In the last Signal YFI-A DC increase to 30m has won. There are few possibilities how to move ahead so I am going to list them here.  Increase DC to 30m, but also increase SF to 10%. Create YFI-B with a LR of 225%. Such vault type could have another 20m DC applied with a SF closer to what it is now (4%). Whitelisted vaults? We haven\u2019t heard from the SC team if this is doable in a short term and also what it implies for Maker offering such products. Leave DC at 20m and increase SF to 7%. Some might feel the whole situation is too risky to additionally increase DC.  Note that despite the outcome here I am going to propose to increase YFI-A SF to 7% when we have a Rates Group meeting next week. Which step should we take forward regarding YFI vaults?     Increase DC to 30m and SF to 10% Create YFI-B with 225% LR / 20m DC / 4% SF Whitelisted vaults when available Leave DC at 20m and increase SF to 7% Other - Comment below Abstain     0 voters     Poll will remain open until this Friday December 4th and the winner will proceed to on-chain poll next week (including proposed SF increase to 7% for YFI-A if options 2 or 3 win) ",

While the vault would get liquidated after a 14% price drop, you\u2019d need another 43% drop for the liquidation to resolve at a loss. 51% total drop. Binance YFI/USDT has more than $100m in daily volume. Coinbase YFI/USD has more than $35m in daily volume.  Raising the SF for the YFI-A vaults to 7% sounds like a good idea to make the interest rate more in-line with competitors. Makes sense to raise the rate closer to a market rate when the risk team doesn\u2019t want more than 20M or 30M exposure for YFI-A. ",

I believe the reason behind this, came from a previous post. Basically with 40M we hold 10% of YFI. Even if you have a good turnover in terms of liquidity. You don\u2019t dump 10% of the whole supply with out moving the market. Especially when the market is already down. The idea is first to decrease the risk and smooth the dump by having a spread on the dumping via the LR and the different vault. ",

Which means the only other option in short term is to increase YFI-A DC to 30m and raise SF, if increasing debt exposure is preferred (so far it seems low LR vault type option has same amount of votes as 30m DC / 10% SF option). I agree that 10% SF may not be competitive enough. I am simply stating the numbers from our model, but of course our model doesn\u2019t predict exact numbers since it is based on assumptions. If we are confident that few whales who are keeping low CR can avoid liquidations successfully all the time, risk premium is lower than 10%. On the other hand, the Rates Group can still propose lower SF next week and there is no rule that states SF needs to equal Risk Premium all the time, since RP mostly helps with guidance and is only estimated. We have actually violated this (under compensation of risk) few times this year when we kept fees very low. ",

                    "content": "    zenithlight:  I\u2019m slightly frustrated about the pattern of Maker governance making suboptimal decisions due to being unnecessarily rigid in the governance process. From delaying setting Stablecoin fees to 0% because of some technicality in the IRV, to not polling separately for YFI DC increase and rates.   There was an option to keep the DC as it is. Overall, YFI is risky due to liquidity so it\u2019s hard to find the best solution. Moreover, looking at MkrAnalytics,  it seems the main culprit is not the SF but the drop in YFI price. image701\u00d7554 52.7 KB Quite sure we will decrease YFI-A SF again as the debt is now lower (and therefore the risk). I don\u2019t like the fact that we are going algorithmic neither, but what we want here is better PR. Like providing a RP curve for \u201clow liquidity\u201d collateral. @Doo, I think your number is for Aave v2. It\u2019s less expensive in Aave v1. ",
