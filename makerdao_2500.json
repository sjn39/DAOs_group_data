DAI is also trending higher and currently stands at $1.03. Fortunately we have USDT and PAX Vault available and ideally we would like to see some diversification from USDC into other stablecoins. However those two Vault types are not efficient in terms of capital use (higher liquidation ratio for both) and we are still testing how appealing they are for arbitrageurs as they just got launched. There is also an additional buffer available in USDC-B Vault, but this type of vault is primarily better suited for auctions due to high SF. Also, if we are afraid DAI/USDC arbitrageurs won\u2019t be available to mint any more DAI from USDC and peg might be affected negatively, there is still a lot of DAI liquidity on Compound and arbitrageurs could still borrow there. But obviously we want arbitrageurs to use Maker and we know Maker is more popular because it has liquidations turned off and USDC price is fixed. So by being more conservative I think we should be increasing USDC-A debt ceiling very soon, the question is by how much. If the outcome of this vote is to increase it, the vote will go straight into executive this Friday.

Really as an experiment to see if it would even put a decent dent in the PEG (1.014 to perhaps 1.005) - which at this time I think is less rather than more likely but it would be an interesting test. USDC-A SF down from 4-3 (maybe 2 even)% leave DC for now until it gets soaked up. WBTC SF down from 2-1.5% up DC at least 10M - maybe 20M PSM of 20M but I\u2019d like to see a PSM that would control rate of use by having a variable pricing band that changes based on how much stablecoin is in the facility.   Still working up what I consider best case PSM design. I think LINK is risky to add but think it could also mint 10M DAI if the LR is reasonable (150-170), SF of perhaps 2%. I am also interested in Lev\u2019s MIP20 approach but don\u2019t think it has enough teeth for what we lose.  If we are going to give up on the 1:1 DAI backing I\u2019d rather do it in a way that has significant teeth and in two steps.  Threaten to do it (via a MIP proposal) then if the markets don\u2019t flinch actually Mint 1% new DAI from thin air, run with a negative surplus.   If the markets still don\u2019t flinch then buy assets with the funds and keep them outside of the system.    But I think a real discussion on ranking what are the most important constraints to maintain probably would be a good option because I have yet to see consistent views regarding ranking constraints in terms of importance that we can use to drive MIP monetary policy tool development. BTW:  I voted to increase WBTC by 10-20M and lower or keep same SF. ",

What do we need to ensure the peg? Not a simple question but part of the answer now is to increase supply How de we do that? Reducing fees/New collaterals What happens if the fees are below the risk profile of the asset? It\u2019s a trade off between the collateral and the peg, we choose the peg. Perhaps other options changes this trade off but sadly it\u2019s all we have right now. If there is high demand for a collateral, should we increase the fee to capture more profit? As long as the supply is increasing helping support the peg definitely yes. We should optimize and another way to look at it is that is subsidizing eth 0% fees. If another black thursday were to happen I would want the biggest war chest we can have and that\u2019s not going to happen at 0% rates  ",

Besides the centralization risk, the two issues that were brought up at the time were low liquidity and the fact that the community was unsure of demand for WBTC outside of Maker. The two above issues have shown significant progress. Currently, there\u2019s a market cap of around ~11000 WBTC = ~$100mm. Although a good part of this growth has been due to Maker, a large part of the demand has been outside of Maker. Additionally, there are around 5 new merchants being added to the WBTC ecosystem and this allows the ecosystem to scale liquidity much better with demand. ",

I\u2019ve brought DeversiFi up multiple times before and I believe it to be the dark horse here and it gets ignored a bit. Because of the mapping with Bitfinex, DeversiFi can take on a lot of WBTC in exchange for USDT in such events. ",

The consequence is, although it is still \u201cN out of M\u201d, these values are much bigger, and can be applied in multiple layers. Concretely, 2-out-of-2 signatures are used to custody funds, but each key is itself simulated into a multisig using the MPC algorithm. The first key is 34-out-of-100, where the signatories are selected from a permission-less pool of nodes (currently 1100+ in size). The second key is N-out-of-M (where N = M/3+1), where the signatories are voted in by the community, based upon their reputation and respective ecosystem sizes (for example, Curve is a member of this one of the participants in this signature, because their ecosystem is well-incentivised to behave based on their use of renBTC).

You also state that funds are 2of2 custodied, where the first is an MPC system and the second is also an MPC system but without permissionless participation of the first. This setup indicates a few things to me:  In it\u2019s current iteration, your team does not have sufficient faith in the security of the 1100 nodes operated by token holders. Likely due to you guys not believing the tokens are sufficiently circulated yet. While the funds cannot be stolen by a \u201cmultisig\u201d, is it fair to say they could be burned by the 2nd MPC run by trusted community members?  I believe REN is a great project and renBTC should be included as collateral but I also think it is quite high risk and early stage (and not necessarily better than wBTC across the board). Do you find the following summary of the renBTC\u2019s risk model fair:  renBTC assumes that it is sufficiently difficult for pseudoanonymous nodes to collude and achieve 1/3 quorum. renBTC assumes that colluding pseudononymous and community actors will lose more in REN value or reputational value than they gain in collateral stolen value  If either of these conditions hold then the system is safe (ignoring the scenario where community actors collude to burn but not steal), otherwise, funds are at risk.

This means it is critical that:  Liquidators are able to access DAI to use to purchase collateral with. Liquidators are able to hedge the price exposure they gain by purchasing collateral. Liquidators can recycle capital or have sufficient capital to cover all auctions.  For wBTC, the main concern in my eyes is point 3. For 1 we now have the USDC-B vault. For 2 we have extremely liquid BTCUSD markets in crypto. But for 3 I\u2019d like to know how long it takes to turn wBTC into BTC in order to settle a hedge put on in a BTCUSD market. ",

Outside of the tech concerns, 26% drop in BTC price would be hugely detrimental to the loan portfolio as a whole. You\u2019d likely see ETH plummet right with it, so really ends up becoming how much demand is there going to be from the keepers of the world to buy this depressed collateral and at what price would they take it. Do keepers have the capital reserves required to soak up ~60M DAI worth of bad debt? No idea. That said as long as there is enough liquidity in the keeper pool to soak up maybe half that amount I think the system would be \u201cfine.\u201d Although MKR holders would end up eating a big bill in that circumstance. Anything more than that and we would be into real uncharted territory. As dire as all of that sounds my stance on this is that BTC price risk is no worse than ETH price risk given that they are so correlated, so in my view as long as the desire is to grow the loan portfolio as much as we can, accepting more WBTC is no better or worse than accepting ETH. This view makes the price risk arguments end up being a little moot. The only material thing here IMO is whether or not you want to accept the custodian risk which is certainly a concern. ",
