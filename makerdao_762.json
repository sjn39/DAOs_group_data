                    "content": " SourceCred Distribution Delayed to Monday 2022-03-07 (at the earliest) This post is to update the community on the delay in SourceCred distributions. This is the first time GovAlpha is taking on the distributions and while we had the ability to send out payments today, we opted to delay until next week so that we can verify all 77 transactions properly. Values displayed on makerdao.sourcecred.io should be accurate for this upcoming distribution, as our hold up is in verifying that the dispersement app we are using has compiled the data correctly. Luckily we have our resident technical wizard @hernandoagf working on creating a custom solution to check expected values from Gnosis Safe\u2019s transaction API.  Please Contact me (@prose11) if this payment delay is causing a hardship. It was not our intention to delay these payments, but we decided it was better to be safe than sorry during our inaugural run at owning SourceCred distributions. If there are reasonable mitigating actions we can take to make up for this inconvenience I am happy to do so. ",
