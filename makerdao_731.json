The MakerDAO SES team has been working to compile a list of potential Core Units to incubate during the remainder of 2022. This list has been built by MakerDAO SES in collaboration with other Core Units and stakeholders in preparation of the Q2 launch of the restructured SES Incubator aiming to increase the throughput and quality of facilitator candidates. MakerDAO SES is calling for the community to engage in thoroughly reviewing the list, provide questions, comments, and additional Core Unit ideas to consider. Joins us Friday to jumpstart the conversation, and explore the potential future for our incubator.
