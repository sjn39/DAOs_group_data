Naturally. \"What they tell you is that DAOs are decentralized autonomous organizations. Groups of humans organizing around a specific purpose, coordinating via an agreed-upon set of engagement rules enforced on a blockchain and sharing economic resources and/or protocol rules in the quest to fulfil said purpose. What they don\u2019t tell you in the brochure is that humans organizing around a purpose, sharing resources and coordinating via an ever evolving agreed-upon set of rules is HARD. Just like a butterfly transforming from a fleshy, ground bound caterpillar, new forms of human organization take their time to evolve from the hairy situation we\u2019ve progressively calcified ourselves into. The complexities of coordination, collaboration and co-creation are so multi-faceted, multi-layered and multi-coloured that they are as beautiful as they are infuriating. Evolving DAOs feels like building a house on quicksand. During an earthquake. In the rain. It\u2019s all about balance. It\u2019s an extreme exercise in balance above everything else.\" Full post on Mirror ",
