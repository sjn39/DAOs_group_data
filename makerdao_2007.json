The ownership currently belongs to @kat as per the MIP55c3-SP7, but due to personal reasons Kat has recently communicated her decision to step down from her role and responsibilities with the program. I\u2019ve been fulfilling this role for the past two months, and the payments were done thanks to the help of @davidutro and @tadeo. After consulting with @prose11, I\u2019m requesting to be made the owner of the multi-sig by Tadeo and David to easen their burden in the following payments of the program. ",
