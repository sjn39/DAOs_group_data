As a former Software Developer, I\u2019m a huge fan of StackOverflow (c.f. my profile). It organically grew to become the biggest platform for devs to help each other out, and even became StackExchange who supports dozen of \u201cStackOverflow clones\u201d across almost any topic. Its advanced moderation features allowed to reduce noise and increase signal to an extent that it makes finding almost anything super easy: duplicates removal, advanced moderation levels, questions reviews, answers reviews, etc. Event though Jeff Atwood is both cofounder at StackOverflow and Discourse, the later still kinda sucks at basic things such as linking up relevant threads and providing any kind of clear flagging for highly valuable inputs and contributors (in comparison to StackOverflow). The result is that (i) the forum is totally flooded with tons of content, opinions and debates that are actually duplicate of previously addressed points and (ii) one often ends up reading a whole thread when a simple summary at the top would often be enough. How about we consider hacking these issues by simply asking Original Posters to try (i) to update their post with relevant threads they come across afterwards and \u201ccherry on top\u201d (ii) a summary of the whole thread in the Original Post itself? p.s. I\u2019m trying to do this in this thread where I\u2019m the OP ",
