Review the Grants Round 10 Governance Brief To payout the matching allocations from Grants Round 10, we need the stewards to ratify the matching allocations. This comes with the extra responsibility of ratifying the decisions made by Gitcoin Holdings and the Anti-Fraud & Collusion workstream of GitcoinDAO. To make the payouts in a timely manner, we would like to suggest voting on Wednesday, July 14th*. Here are the need to know items:  The round totals on the site are not adjusted for anti-sybil measures.  In response to a few requests to make the data easier to read. We\u2019ve updated this new version with the Blockscience fraud detection and Gitcoin results side by side (data is the same): Grants Round 10 Final Payout Amounts* *Feel free to comment directly on the sheet.  The total fraud tax for GR10 was $14,350, down over 50% from GR9  The fraud tax is the difference in allocations before and after the sybil account contributions are deactivated from matching eligibility.   Grant Approval, Grant Disputes, and User Sanctions are now determined by the Anti-Fraud & Collusion workstream with oversight from the community. Ratifying the decisions of the Anti-Fraud workstream does not create new policy. There will be opportunity to discuss their decisions in depth and ratify new policy prior to GR11.  The defensive measures taken to protect against fraud and collusion had incredible results. This may have been partly because of the community involvement and oversight. While there is still more work to be done in progressively decentralizing the grants platform, ratifying this round\u2019s closure will set a precedent for trusting, but verifying the workstream\u2019s decisions. (Similar mechanism design to an optimistic roll-up). Please vote FOR or AGAINST FOR You ratify the results as reported by Gitcoin Holdings & the Anti-Fraud & Collusion workstream and request the keyholders of the community multi-sig* to payout funds according to the Grants Round 10 Final Payout Amounts the non-custodial GR10 deployment contract. AGAINST You do not ratify the results and request keyholders of the community multi-sig wallet to delay payment until further notice. *This allows for 5 days of deliberation from today, 7/9/21 until 7/14/21. Round totals for before and after defensive measures will be added here on Monday 7/12/21. ** The Ethereum ecosystem is governed by the community multi-sig which we intend to transfer to the GitcoinDAO treasury once select criteria has been met. For questions, comments or concerns on any of the above, please comment below or join the Gitcoin Discord! ",

Our goal with the anti-fraud workstream will be to make sure the data and calcs can be run and verified by the community in the near future. We will post the list of users to disable from matching benefits and let the greater wisdom of the community find error or issue. It will take more time before that is fully enabled. A problem now is that we are working to build the decentralized grants tech (dGrants) so it is not likely that we will have cycles to document the data structures of the \u201clegacy\u201d version. We also must consider that as long as Gitcoin Holdings has centralized servers hosting any data, they also maintain liability for that data. I think this round the vote to approve is saying something like \u201cWe recognize the Gitcoin team has had sole control over this in the past (and still does). We approve the methodology and intentions used and appreciate the direction the team is moving to decentralize this aspect of the system. The oversight and mechansism aren\u2019t perfect now, but to get payments out and not have perfect be the enemy of good, we approve.\u201d This will probably still be true for GR11. We will improve, but not have it perfect. I expect that each oversight and decision making mechanism will be improved both in documentation and execution. The goal would be to have strong mechanism design in place when the time comes to fully decentralize the technological architecture hosting grants along with the political power and decision making in a way that is verifiable through open-source software.

This is logical.  The \u2018Commons Stack\u2019 (CS) has a few longstanding grant applications with Gitcoin.  And they are an altruistic organization doing good work!  Full disclosure, I am a trusted seed (approved member) of the CS. while Ostrom suggests graduated sanctions our current appeal policy is rather binary.  Either a grant gets approved or it does not.  There is an entire Gitcoin User Policy under development which imo should house the graduated sanctions to be issued for contraventions of user policy.  I see don\u2019t see a real spot for gradation of the appeals process unless we consider having graduated levels of appeal available to grant applicants (which is my suggestion). There are huge growing pains right now as the decentralization process matures.  This was expected and tolerable.  Joe has a great perspective:  We must not let the striving for perfection destroy the good system we currently have.  It is continually improving. Accordingly, I support ratification. disclosure:  I am part of the Gitcoin Dao Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD) workstream. ",
