We are eager to keep improving and providing the most value to the community. This poll was intended as a way to capture the community\u2019s thoughts on what sections are most or least useful in our analysis, measured as:  I\u2019d like more focus on I\u2019d like less focus on I sit on the fence    Results For the purposes of this survey the team is interpreting \u201cmore of\u201d vs \u201cless of\u201d results in terms of greater detail wanted vs more conciseness in a section of our due diligence. Globally response cross sections remains positive but has room for improvement (+ 60% of votes \u201cmore of\u201d) Chart1200\u00d7741 30.3 KB Chart1542\u00d7900 33.9 KB Highlights:  Community clearly wishes greater focus on 5 sections of assessment (+ 2/3 of voters)  Exec Summary, AO analysis, Risk levels, Lend process   Four sections of assessment don\u2019t seem to have greater appeal, given either neutral or negative view by respondents (+1/2 of voters) A clear winner the community wants greater focus is on \u201cExecutive Summaries\u201d for RWA assessments  Unfortunately, given little extra qualitative data to assess poll results, we cannot interpret them much further. But we\u2019re open to feedback anytime. Last, we have taken your feedback and reworked our due diligence templates and documentation. We are sharpening our pencils to deliver some nice Exec Summaries and improved assessments ;). Thanks all The RWF team: @SebVentures @Philinje @williamr ",

I feel this way because, if structured correctly, Maker will always have a super-senior position over the Vault owner\u2019s assets (with the Vault owner putting up a significant amount of their own equity), and have the ability to force a speedy re-financing or liquidation. Therefore the macro picture should not dramatically affect the system. I\u2019d really only be concerned about those things if they were to reduce the efficacy of a potential liquidation. As for covenants, structure, and risk, those have the potential to cause catastrophic damage to the system if not correctly scrutinized - so I\u2019d always like to see more analysis done in those areas. Hope that is helpful! ",
