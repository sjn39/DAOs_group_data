                    "content": "I recently saw this proposal on the Optimism forum: Users who sold the initial OP airdrop should become ineligible for all future airdrops.  Have seen enough wallets collect the OP airdrop, swap it straight to Uniswap. These accounts are not playing a constructive role in Optimism governance. Instead of contributing to governance, they are maximising for profit. Nothing wrong with that, as per the airdrop criteria the coins are theirs and they are free to do as they wish. However, from Optimism governance\u2019s perspective, such accounts are counter-productive for our stated goals.  I was extremely pleased to see this proposal. Canceling the future airdrops of those that have sold their initial OP airdrop seems sensible, well-considered and targets the heart of any crypto protocol: the price of its token. However, I am unable to support this proposal in its current form. My lack of support for this proposal is not because I disagree with the sentiment. On the contrary, it is because this proposal does not go far enough. In order to support this proposal, I believe it needs to be significantly extended in scope (who is punished) and severity (what the punishment is). I have included my extended suggestions:  Increase the scope of the proposal.  In addition to canceling the airdrops of OP sellers, we should also consider a wider net of eligibility for airdrop slashing. I propose that we, Optimism Collective, cancels the future airdrops of anyone that has sold any token in the last 6 months. These people have a pattern of undesirable behaviour, we can consider them \u201cpotential future sellers\u201d. I think I speak for everyone when I say: do we really want people that might sell one day in the governance group? No, we don\u2019t. Optimism governance should be a group that you can never leave: until death do us part. I will note that the 6-month mark may be too short. I have selected this as I believe that people can find the error of their ways and move forwards as a better person. But perhaps we should check if they have sold any tokens ever? Or include non-crypto assets too? Have they sold a used car before? Could be predictive of undesirable \u201cseller\u201d behaviour.  Increase the severity of the punishment.  Is cancelling a future airdrop good enough? I propose that the punishment for disrespecting Optimism\u2019s governance token price should be significantly harsher in order to dissuade future bad actors. Two ideas I have: a) We issue a debt token to the sellers, and instruct local debt collection agencies to collect the debt money from these people. Bonus: added revenue for optimism. b) We consider physical violence against sellers. Nobody will take us seriously unless we are willing to fight for what we believe in. There is precedent here, most governance groups have an active army eg. US Government. I think this is a good area to get creative, so I would request of my fellow Optimism Collective governance group colleagues to also suggest preferred punishment ideas.  Also cancel the airdrops of everyone that bought OP since the airdrop.  Everyone that has bought the airdrop has also sinned. Firstly, they have interacted with the sellers. That is bad enough by itself. The OP tokens they hold are tainted \u2018sold\u2019 tokens. Yet, additionally, they have purchased OP, potentially with a market buy! This makes OP more expensive and harder to participate in for the common man. By buying OP, and making it more expensive, not only do you encourage people to sell since they are in profit, but you also make OP governance only accessible to a16z and other rich whales. In many ways, buyers are just enabling the sellers, while making selling more desirable, and increasing the price to make membership to this group harder to achieve. I believe they should have equal (if not harsher) treatment as the sellers.  Cancel the governance power of any token that has been sold.  Tokens that have been sold on the market should lose all governance power. The airdrop was gifted to people with the goal of participating in governance, not to be sold! Sellers have effectively stolen money from the Optimism Collective. Therefore, owning sold OP tokens is isomorphically similar to owning stolen property, or accepting money from proceeds of crime. Sold tokens should be considered void and potentially a criminal act.  I did consider some additional ideas, including:  Cancel the future airdrops of anyone that posted on the forum so far (they clearly do not need additional incentive to govern) Cancel the future airdrops of anyone that commented on the price (since they are focused on the wrong metric, the important metric is number of governance proposals) Instead of mass physical violence against sellers in general, could instead have one large horrific outsized violent event (eg. but more like the crucifixion of Jesus rather than a terrorism-type event) in order to dissuade sellers  However, I thought these ideas were impractical because Jesus\u2019 message travelled long beyond his death and making a martyr of a seller might not be a good idea.

Nevermind the fact that OP price is now higher than what I sold for, I have still sinned and I must be punished. Non-snark edit: Does it not seem ridiculous to punish trading in this manner? Tokens are meant to be traded, a fair value for the token can never be found if trading doesn\u2019t occur. Selling doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re anti-Optimism, it just means you sold. When tokens worth potentially thousands of USD show up in your account, you have a responsibility to yourself to manage the risk associated with holding those tokens. Encouraging blind HODL mentality may feel good, but it does a disservice to people who may legitimately need that money, and ultimately it just kicks the selling can down the road until airdrops are over.

The righteous desire to blacklist sellers is a naive, thinly veiled grasp at getting more tokens sent to oneself, undoubtedly with the hope that you will become richer when you dump the tokens from a higher price, but not in an evil way, such as immediately after an airdrop. Also, this type of token governance in its current form is incredibly stupid to begin with, illustrated well by the popular thread on blacklisting airdrop sellers. An idea being popular says nothing about it\u2019s merit or efficacy at what it portends to be aimed at fixing. ",

Here is, in my own words, why it might not be a terrible proposal: https://twitter.com/norswap/status/1532012865607065600    It is clearly a bad proposal. Selling =/= dissenting Your argument that it is a good proposal lies in the idea that selling indicates people (a) do not believe in Optimism, (b) do not value participating in governance. This is reasonably obviously not true for all sellers. Other reasons someone might sell include:  They think the valuation of OP is currently too high and they can wait until it becomes aligned with their expectations in order to participate in governance, and thus have a larger governance share. They think the valuation is okay, but they expect a post-airdrop dump. They want to buy lower and they think they can sell quickly before this \u201cairdrop dump\u201d happens and rebuy more OP. The airdrop is meaningfully large for their net worth, so selling some tokens makes a big difference to them, but they still believe in the future of Optimism. They sold on airdrop addresses and rebought on other addresses to anonymise their on-chain activity. They have tax obligations. They are selling 90% of their crypto portfolio because they are scared of a bear market, but they will rebuy in a couple of years. They are fucking rekt and this $ income helps them a lot, maybe one day if they are no longer rekt they can afford to participate in governance of the projects they believe in again.  Since it is possible to sell and still believe in Optimism and still want to participate in governance, permanently censoring addresses doesn\u2019t seem like a good option. Cost of user acquisition Even if your argument were true, and all sellers did not believe in Optimism and did not value participating in governance, it is still not sufficient reason to censor their ability to participate in the future! The airdrop spend equity (in the form of $OP) for user acquisition and user retention. The focus on user acquisition and retention is clear through the airdrop criteria, where users and repeat users are heavily rewarded. They are even rewarded much more than DAO voters!   image1392\u00d7608 88.3 KB  Their tokens were earned for their Optimism usage. That was the criteria set by OP Labs (or whoever is in charge). Clearly, this was a reward for specifically using Optimism, something that OP Labs found to be an important metric. Plus, since users expect airdrops, users will speculatively use a product in order to gain the future airdrop. $OP spend is a customer acquisition cost for those users. Now, imagine the future airdrop that you are censoring these users from. Will the future airdrop target \u201cusage\u201d as a metric again? If a future airdrop were to target usage once again, that means OP Labs or The Foundation believe rewarding/paying for usage is still important. If you believe paying for usage (as bootstrapping mechanism) is important, how can you justify not including specific users? If you are paying people to use the product, it is expected that some of those people will sell by nature of the incentive! If you don\u2019t believe paying users is important in the future, then you should not define airdrop criteria to reward users. If the future airdrop does not target \u201cusage\u201d as a metric, but instead targets governance-specific activities, and these addresses were eligible based on their behaviour from today until this theoretical airdrop, how can you justify not including governance participants because they once, historically, sold some tokens? They have done other actions that qualify them as good governors or participants. Is that overridden by historical financial activity? If you want to airdrop only to people that will keep the coins, then you should not even make the token transferable! Of course, this would not be an effective customer acquisition tool, which is why nobody does that. Why does the price matter? The proposal is motivated entirely by the short-term price of $OP.  The short-term token price action is detached from the performance of governance almost entirely. The only people that care are price-speculators, traders and short-term investors. Governance certainly performs the same whether the price is $1.50 or $2.  Sure, extensive price changes could make governances attacks on Optimism cheaper, but there is not a single mention of that in the initial proposal, and it is not really a concern given the size of the airdrop or the short-term nature of the sell-pressure from \u201cinstant dumpers\u201d. The valuation of Optimism will be defined by Optimism\u2019s ability to gain traction, market share, being valuable to users, etc. Airdrop dumpers cannot materially impact that. Does it matter if the price goes down for a day or two? Why does OP Labs care? It is the price you pay for using equity as a behaviour-incentivisation tool. Is a \u2018holder\u2019 more valuable? Perhaps you can argue that you can optimise the treasury and $OP equity spent by not including \u201cpotential dumpers\u201d, and thus rewarding only holders or \u201clong term believers\u201d. You can argue that you\u2019re giving free money to these evil dumping people for nothing. But for this to be true, you would need to show that a holder-user more valuable to Optimism than a seller-user. Is the number of long-term holders of OP an important metric to the success of Optimism? Imagine two users:   User A is a regular, legitimate user of Optimism. They get all their friends to use Optimism. They have a lot of daily on-chain activity. They have no interest in participating in governance, so they sold their initial airdrop.   User B delegated their initial airdrop and didn\u2019t participate at all in governance either. They still hold their tokens and their delegate votes every now and then. They have used Optimism once per month.   Which user is most valuable to Optimism? Which user should be rewarded in future airdrops? I don\u2019t see how the \u2018holder\u2019 criteria is necessarily the thing to optimise for, and don\u2019t see how punishing historic sellers is the right mechanism for rewarding holders anyway. Airdrop and token distribution criteria should match what it is incentivising. The previous airdrop, users were rewarded for being a user. If you want to reward holding, you can design mechanisms for that easily. Ineffective measure Even if you concluded that you wanted to do this, regardless of it being a bad idea, then the measure itself is ineffective. Users will simply change their address. It takes ten seconds. You do a lot of work, raise negative pr, etc for something that is completely ineffective.  If Optimism is to be the primary L2 of Ethereum, it will have millions of users. It will not be expected that every user is also a governor. If you don\u2019t want your airdrop to be sold, make it non-transferable. In fact, if you don\u2019t believe your airdrop is a customer acquisition cost ($) then make it non-transferable and see what happens  ",

I practically saw those small transaction and the exchange price was around 3.3$ Back to twitter I guess some-people saw the same thing on chain and spoke about addresses already having #OP tokens People began hitting the claim page to check if it was possible to claim,I think the traffic to that page brought some glitch to the page\u2026and then a spooky response to users who were once eligible that they were not eligible, this further created panic Then the narrative came in,that it was possible to claim writing some codes,I personally kept watching uniswap as liquidity was added and taken out and price began to drop to lower $3 Finally the claim page was ready and I think I could remember #OP token had dumped below $3 More glitch on the claiming process causing more panic,twitter community was already filled with lots of FUD. Those who claimed felt it was necessary to exit,not because they did not believe in the project,but out of FUD\u2026further dumping the price.   Questions OP Team must ask is:  Who tweeted \u201csup nerds\u201d on the official OptimismPBC account,was it an encoded message to pass on to a selected few who had skill in writing solidity codes to call the claim function from the backdoor? 2. Irrespective of the answer the author of that tweet gives,the OP team should punish him,a severe punishment like revoking his OP Token team allocation,and even suing him to court and made to pay a fine or even serve a jail time\u2026to me, he or she spoofed on the team,and community at large.   The sages say \"charity begins at home\"  I don\u2019t know if this is possible\u2026kick out Uniswap from OP  I believe many other proposals on how to deal with the sellers and buyers on uniswap will come up. Finally with a decision to uphold fairness,accountability and right policies in the blockchain space,I will suggest every central exchange that traded the token before it was officially announced/listed yesterday should issue a public document stating the way and manner those tokens arrived on their exchanges and a clear and precise punishment for those users by way of debiting their accounts and funds returned to OP team or a buy and burn action. Any transaction\u2026claiming,selling and buying after the official announcement on twitter should should be declared valid/true. ",

The only people who sold are people that needed the money. This only hurts poor people, and all the people with a million OP to throw around don\u2019t understand this. When you can\u2019t afford to pay rent or get groceries, you don\u2019t have a choice. I know this is the normal in the United States, but this is international.  You don\u2019t have to make the rich richer and the poor poorer, and you don\u2019t have to cancel everyone because they didn\u2019t do what you wanted them to. If noone was suppose to sell their OP then they could have done a vesting period like luna. \u201cYou made money and I lost because you sold\u201d is what is going on here. Its like 5 year olds throwing a tantrum, and you would think there has never been an airdrop before in history. Also of note, Uniswap airdropped to all users, including those with failed transactions that never even really used their platform. They have done just fine. If I want to sell and buy my tokens 20 times I will, and if I am punished for it I\u2019ll just go somewhere else that allows freedom. And many others will too, and you would be leff micromanaging a dwindling user base that is over-governed. Anyways, OP has a better argument than myself that may be generally more well accepted. Whatever reason you want, cancel culture is a bad idea because once you run out of enemies to cancel then next thing you know you are the one canceled. Thankyou cobie for your rational, well spoken, and simple explanation of just a few of the reasons why excluding poor people from future gains is a bad idea. ",

Without reiterating the points youve already made, I\u2019ll try (and fail)* to keep it simple from a narrow/more concentrated perspective. Historically, I am active in both governance and innovation, on and off chain, for any any project I am active in. To name a few: YAM, DARK(segmented release, one of the first polygon native tokens, eventual failure), veDAO, and FRAX. These statements can be (chain-wise) verfied by my synonymous twitter/eth/discord handle \u201cLyule67(.eth)\u201d. I sold all my $OP simply because at the moment I am financially hurting and over burdened and I was beyond grateful for being included in the airdrop. The same was the case with my $UNI airdrop, and my $ENS/airdrop. My soul genuinely hurt reading that due to temporary circumstances I might suffer lasting consequences, ae being shunned in the very place that I love the most, the place I have dedicated more time to than anywhere else in the last 5 years While I understand the desire to cut \u201cthe fat\u201d or burdensome non-contributing (f)actors from the system (and/or future airdrops), I think a rolling blacklist is a terrible idea. I love the narrative of crypto, I love Ethereum\u2019s mission, and I love what I believe we all are working towards. The idea of free and open, distributed, censorless systems ESPECIALLY in regard to public goods is probably the greatest objective, the greatest movement, the greatest narrative, I have ever seen, much less been a part of. The Ethos of Ethereum is what brought me here, and what will keep me here til im dead. The money ive made along the way has been life changing, and I have been forever grateful for that, but it truly was and remains but a great bonus to what really matters, which leads me to my conclusion: (TL;DR) Unless im mistaken, we all share the goals of universal inclusivity, of building not only (a) much more efficient and resilient system(s), but FAIR and incorruptable mechanics, in short, to make the world a better place and to change as many lives for the better as possible. Pushing for a rolling blacklist on the grounds of \u201cdeadweight/dumping\u201d does none of these things. Im sure, like many before you, your hardwork and generosity literally changed many lives for the better. Many people in crypto possess 0 traditional crypto-esque skills, yet still strive to and do make a huge difference to the benefit of us all by other means. Maybe they\u2019re a struggling artist who freely dedicated time and work to various unpaid advertisements and sold to support themselves another month. Maybe, like me, it was just horrible (and miraculous) timing and saved me financially. Maybe they live in a less fortunate economy and the immediate benefit was far greater to them than the power to create change in the system later. Almost everything in life is circumstantial, and I implore you (Optimism Coop) and anyone else not to make permanent decisions based on temporary circumstances/actions. At the root of it all, I believe most of us come to crypto to make the world a better place. Regardless of your decision, I want to thank you, truly, for being profound contributors in this space, and for fighting on the frontlines of arguably one of the absolute most important hurdles between us and global adoption. I commend you for your accomplishments and, for the benefit of us all, wish you well on the road ahead! (PS, thank you for proving my 2017 \u201crollup\u201d hypothesis correct, I KNEW it could be done !!) In finality, I am all too sure the last 72hours have been a rollercoaster of emotions for the Optimism Team, and I know there are plenty of thankless, entitled, arrogant a****les who care about none of the aforementioned, but they, I believe, are the minority, and I for one am nothing less than thankfull for your contribution(s). STAY OPTIMISTIC (= Thank you for your time, I apologize for the length.  Lyule67.ETH  ",

Obviously it doesn\u2019t make any sense to restrict future airdrops purely based on whether an account sold their allocation, but I think it is very important to use governance participation as a criteria for future airdrops. I definitely disagree with the lazy participant ideology for a number of reasons. Is a holder more valuable?     cobie:  If Optimism is to be the primary L2 of Ethereum, it will have millions of users. It will not be expected that every user is also a governor.   Disagree here, delegation is incredibly easy, and people\u2019s participation in governance is vital to the livelihood of the chain. As is the case in any democratic society, it is a moral imperative for members to contribute to equitable governance, whether this be through delegation or direct voting.  None of this experiment works without people contributing to governance, and it has been shown time and time again in crypto and elsewhere that governance is not something that can just be left to a few seemingly benevolent parties. Why does price matter Token price will strongly affect Optimism\u2019s user acquisition efforts, as protocol incentives will be paid out in OP.  There needs to be incentive to hold or acquire the token (Prior to actual value accrual being added (pls)), otherwise the token will just be farmed to a point where the incentives are worthless.  All of the other incentive programs are done on the backs of holders, and they deserve to be compensated more so than those who sell and immediately realize their profit. You raise all of these valid reasons for people to sell the free tokens they got to lock in profit, but somehow don\u2019t come to the conclusion that holders are taking on all of that risk and should thus be rewarded moreso than those who sold.  I have no problem with people selling the airdrop, but doing so is inherently less beneficial to the ecosystem than someone holding/buying and participating in governance. There are plenty of ways for active users to acquire OP going forward, as many different protocols were given an allocation to distribute.  These incentives can be \u201cgamed\u201d however you like, as they are there to simply bring activity to the chain.  The airdrops on the other hand have no business going to people who will just dump them. Conclusion The point of the airdrop was to equitably distribute OP to as many real users as possible with the limited toolset available in DeFi, not to \u201creward\u201d people for being here. There is 0 value added by giving tokens to people who don\u2019t plan on staying long term.  Temporarily pumping usage numbers is pointless, and we should be focused on distributing OP fairly to those who have an interest in the long term success of the ecosystem.

We should cancel airdrops for anyone who has sold any type of token whatsoever in the past 6 months. Only holding should be allowed within optimism. If we could also block all IP addresses from accessing Optimism as well that have ever sold in the past six months, along with the wallet addresses. It is likely that punishing these users for selling by not allowing them in airdrops will reach the same end result as blocking them but we should just be 100% sure. All Optimism users should be mandated also to vote or delegate or be punished as well. All protocols should only allow buying on optimism, and should be linked directly to bridges so the protocols only sell tokens directly from L1 or other L2\u2019s. Also slashing should be implemented as well for all sellers of all tokens. We should definitely publicly post all wallet addresses who sell tokens to publicly ridicule them too. John has started this thankfully, so we need only add to the list. Good work. Using protocols and being an active user of Optimism should count for nothing, ZERO. It should be mandatory that any and all airdrops on Optimism have a TEN YEAR VESTING PERIOD. After the vesting period, tokens will be released to users, but they will have to sign a contract agreeing to drive a stake into their own beating heart if they consider selling, swapping, pooling, profiting, transferring to another wallet, wrapping, or bridging. Protocols should be blacklisted for any type of rewards, as it is basically the same as selling for $0 dollars. In fact, generally commerce in general involves someone selling something to obtain something else. Commerce should generally be banned and punished with airdrop blacklisting, slashing, ip blocking, wallet blocking, and stake driving. Please, feel free to add more ways to punish, blacklist, stifle, chase off, block, hurt, cancel, destroy, decimate, eviscerate, ravage, annihilate, and decimate sellers. SELLERS will not be allowed here on Optimism, and we will let them know it. We need to be EXTREMELY EXCLUSIVE here guys. That means EXCLUDING PEOPLE TO THE EXTREME. It is the only way to truly attract the people we want here. It does not matter at all that we will discourage people who sold anything ever, even for a moment for profit and even 1 token because THESE PEOPLE are certainly one of the following: -poor/ financially not good (we certainly want to punish the poor and oust them) -traders -poolers -defi users -recently rekt by the bear market -uninterested -scared of losing money -needed money to put in optimism protocols -sick and had medical bills -dumpers -in debt -just a bad person -dirty degens -clean degens -apes -got scared when price dropped on launch -didn\u2019t see the available use cases appealing -SUPER poor -\u201cdon\u2019t believe\u201d in voting -thought it was \u201cOK\u201d to sell their personal tokens (note: they were wrong) -had to deposit to stop a liquidation on an optimism protocol -needed money to donate on gitcoin (donation is a form of selling for $0 and is condemned here) -and just pure evil STAND TOGETHER OPTIMISM COMMUNITY. Together we can clear out ANYONE WE DEEM UNWORTHY. Eventually we will be left with the select few\u2026 the proud\u2026 the perfect holders. In 50 years when quantum computers have effectively depreciated the internet and 99.99% of the perfect holders have died of natural causes, staking, decimation, and general whatnot we will be left with one. Sparkle ONE PERFECT HOLDER Sparkle We should strive to be so EXCLUSIVE. PUNISH people for making THE WRONG CHOICE. Selling is not allowed here. Get out of here sellers. You are not welcome on Optimism, and we will show you where it matters, financially and socially/publicly through ridicule. ",

Let me  elaborate.  @cobie may chip in if he sees fit. 1 - \u201cInstadumping\u201d For example, should miners be punished if they sold their block rewards from mining to pay for costs of running them? Should one be penalised for claiming & selling rewards in P.O.S?  should have a database of these dumpers.if they are on the list, any future block rewards they\u2019re entitled to will be slashed as well. 2 - your assumption & logic of why the multiple airdrops. What\u2019s the end game? Only the OP team knows. But I highly doubt it is just to have a chain full of OP bagholders & sees who holds their airdrop the longest? Consider the following: A person who \u201cinstadumped\u201d 3/4 of their airdrop for Eth 1/4  in converted to fiat to enjoy life. A small treat. 1/4 used as capital to explore & interact with  dapps on Optimism. 2/4 used to LP. op/weth or op/usdc, whatever This approach makes a lot more sense.you want to retain as many users as possible to keep transacting on your network. Users essentially get free capital to now explore the vast ecosystem. Criteria for the 1st is telling. Bridge? Used dapps? Voted ? Remained an active user on L1? ",

The reward (larger 2nd airdrop) should be proportional to the # of tokens held.  For example: if you hold no tokens, you would get no \u2018bonus reward\u2019 airdrop. If you held the initial airdrop, you would get the base reward. If you hold more tokens, your reward increases.  Intermediate selling has 0 relevance here and is a personal trading decision.
