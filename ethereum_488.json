We all agreed that open sourcing some information around types of lessons, timing, lesson plans, etc. would help us all do better in keeping up to date with new information, as well as improve the quality of our offerings to our students. I was wondering if anyone had the notes from that sub-ring gathering? ",

Curation Sharing Experiences with resources, flagging incorrect/outdated resources Technology moving so fast. Feedback mechanism on content. Developer hard to find time to share education resources. Evolution intimidating for end learners. Information overload. Distill core concepts. Concepts evolve/iterative. Sharing workshop results. Order and format of content. Good examples. Wrap content around blockchain concepts, but suspend toxic semantics. Resource, beyond remix. Remix first, broader concepts. Formats:  \u201cCode-together\u201d format. 16hr session - mob programming: 1 on keyboard, near circle guiding (documentation, theory), the rest watching and occasional points.
