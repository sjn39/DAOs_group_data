I\u2019m a UX Writer and I\u2019ve been participating in polls and executive votes for a while now-constantly thinking about user experience and MKR holder participation. Nobody should be forced to vote but similarly a small % of voters leaves the system open to manipulation. One of the problems I\u2019ve had (as well as vote.makerdao.com not being mobile friendly with an increasing number of Web3 browsers available) is how it shows the number of votes already cast for each choice before the user has voted. It\u2019s like going to polling station and seeing that 90% of people in your constituency have already voted for your party\u2019s the opposition. It makes sense to me that this would discourage people from voting or thinking independently about which way to vote. It\u2019s already hard to keep up with all the weekly changes and get your head around all the 1st, 2nd and 3rd order affects of your choice. Couple this with immediately seeing your choice has just 0.4% support and it\u2019s likely to be very discouraging, not just for that vote but long term. because what\u2019s the point. And if enough people think \u2018what\u2019s the point\u2019 then that could change the outcome before the vote has even gotten started. I would propose we change the interface so that the outcomes aren\u2019t shown until after the vote is over. While you could argue this is less transparent, those particularly interested in how the vote is shaping up before the cast their own vote could query the network. 3rd party voting platforms could also opt to show if they want. I briefly thought about showing it after the user casts their vote but with the ability to change your vote this could defeat the object. What do you think? ",

Yes the current system suffers from the spoiler effect but as a smaller mkr holder you are able to simply ask yourself which one of these top options most aligns with my world view and vote accordingly. If i am not able to see where the mkr has been staked at this point I run the risk throwing away my vote on some option that is not going to pass in any case which imo is a bigger issue than the influence you received by being able to see the popular options prior to voting.

If i am not able to see where the mkr has been staked at this point I run the risk throwing away my vote on some option that is not going to pass  I hear you but I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s a truer representation of the outcome you want. The alternative is you end up supporting something that you don\u2019t want as much just because it \u2018counts\u2019 (which when you think about it doesn\u2019t make much sense because the more popular option would win the poll with or without your vote). Also, it might seem like you\u2019re \u2018throwing it away\u2019 when you look at it as an individual case but chances are there are many like you who would have collectively made that option viable. What we\u2019re saying is that the option that gets chosen first is more or less the winner every time because it convinces others to vote that way too.  My two cents is that i don\u2019t really think this is a great idea until we have ranked choice voting in place.  Not sure what this is. Could you explain?

                    "content": "Hi @fbarnes , welcome to the forum! Good discussion, on one hand, speaking to users has revealed that showing the balance before the conclusion of polls has helped those who are not following on a daily basis gain an idea of where there is interest and vote accordingly (as they can\u2019t take the time to track chat discussions/posts). On the other hand, this transparency can be detrimental as you say by discouraging people or swaying their vote. It\u2019s tricky and open for debate. Likewise, I\u2019d like to see how ranked choice voting (now available) is received by the community and reassess? The context here is that the current voting model only allows a voter to choose a single candidate, whereas ranked choice allows the users to pick multiple candidates in order of preference. re:  not being mobile friendly  Yes! we have seen an increase in mobile usage and are redesigning the Governance Portal to be mobile responsive, hoping to share that in the coming weeks.

The short answer is that most elections that you are familiar with use a system called \u201cfirst past the post.\u201d There has been loads of research around its many problems, and this problem you are describing is one of the main flaws that is often discussed. For a pretty good ELI5 explanation I would suggest checking out these the two videos in this youtube playlist those videos go over the problem with first past the post and explain how ranked-choice voting works.

Some thoughts off the top of my head:  Minority rule is definitely a potential (and probably present) problem Two-party system isn\u2019t an issue bc in most cases there are no \u2018popular\u2019 candidates before the vote is open. In fact, removing outcomes until after the vote is over actually eliminates this problem since you\u2019re not swayed to vote for a more \u2018popular\u2019 option. I\u2019ll be interested to see how ranked voting goes. Without overcomplicating it, are there any metrics we\u2019re using to measure this against participation of the old system? @Derek   Thanks everyone for the discussion. ",

I imagine this will continue to surface the debate over whether we show which votes are in the lead prior to completion - for now the majority of people want to continue to see this information as it helps them make a decision, but we should definitely revisit if this sentiment changes.
