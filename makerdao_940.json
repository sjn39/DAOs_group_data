Applicants going below this would need to provide strong justification upfront for going below this rate. This would primarily be a timesaving measure, to keep the forums cleaner and keep focus on credible applicants. This will become more important if we start getting more applicants and the protocol grows. I would like feedback, both on the concept and and specific numbers. ",

(as you cannot take on any collateral unless there is a long-term demand for the DAI that being issued on the back this collateral). Instinctively - and I don\u2019t have a lot science to back this instinct up (yet\u2026) - I continue to like the idea of using the common central bank long-term inflation target of 2% as a general starting point and then adjust for global market conditions (inflationary/deflationary), demand for DAI in market and then ultimately add an individual collateral risk and duration premium/consideration. At anyrate, I would definitely not recommend setting asset-side interest rate guidelines that are disconnected from the actual liability side cost. It is quite a dangerous path. A lot of Makers market power sit in this balance sheet dynamics - very important to respect it. ",

For example, Maker is currently considering solar finance deals in which the super-low yields that are being presented as comps are hiding \u201cdealer fees\u201d and other middleman overhead that is often charged in these sorts of transactions \u2013 including by companies started by those who are proposing these projects:    reddit   r/solar - Are we overreacting to solar loan model / dealer fees? 10 votes and 52 comments so far on Reddit      That being said \u2013 from what I can tell, the first RWA deal, in partnership with SocGen, was done at a 0% yield, with unanimous approval from the community? It seems that this may have set a precedent for these proposals, and biased the conversation toward \u201csuper safe cash-like instruments\u201d rather than a healthy mix of risk and reward which would compel projects with more attractive yield to come forward.

As a low-risk, low-yield deal, it seems like a great option \u2014 and, as you say, a great way to add capabilities and relationships to the ecosystem. The question is whether this is the risk/yield profile that the community is looking for \u2014 and also, if the community is willing to give up yield, potentially on the scale of tens of millions of dollars, for future capability- and relationship-building exercises. The proposals which have troubled the participants in this thread share a theme of presenting themselves in a similar manner. It also seems that there is a divergence of opinion among members of the community as to whether they will accept yield discounts for ESG / climate-related offerings. The ongoing Clean Money discussion speaks for itself. Having a consistent policy, openly stated, surrounding these issues would be helpful. For example, more high-profile TradFi participants might bring Maker more capabilities-building transactions such as the SocGen deal if they knew there was a specific policy to support them. ",

Then a bunch of disrespectful replies clog the thread because the community is (understandably) worried. That\u2019s just bad for everyone. So I agree a specific yield isn\u2019t a good filter. But maybe if it\u2019s below a given benchmark, there should be extra justification. Maybe it makes sense and maybe not.
