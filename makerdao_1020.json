                    "content": " TLDR  Restart Burn Immediately   Option I: Hard Burn  Restart previous burn model with all inefficiencies.    Option II: Slow Burn  Burn at a reduced rate until we develop something better.     Restore Revenue Distribution Narrative  Burn until we have a concrete system to replace it.   Retain Investors Retain our Community & Talent   Overview In my opinion, putting aside my own personal shituation, shutting off the burn at a market cycle bottom was arguably one of the worst decisions we have made as a community to date. I will admit that are benefits to operating on a model that prioritizes reinvesting into growth during early stages rather than distributing revenue. It works for Amazon, and it works for many others as well. It may even work for us as well. Unfortunately, in practice, what we\u2019ve done is turn off the only revenue distribution model we had\u2026 at a market cycle bottom. I know it was not perfect. It was inefficient, gameable, and didn\u2019t perceptibly return value to MKR holders. Still imperfect as it was, people liked it. I liked it, and so did many others. As it stands, we have no concrete plan in place to distribute revenue. We removed what we had but are yet to replace it with anything new. Our community members and long-term investors are dropping out like flies. Some from 2018 PTSD, others have just lost faith in our governance community\u2019s ability to deliver. We still have revenue, though! It may be less than before, but that\u2019s expected during a period of market contraction and a general reduction in appetite to borrow and take on risk.  This is temporary!  No market can maintain consistent negative perp funding indefinitely. A majority of market players taking one side of a position for pushing six months now are inevitably going to get rekt. It\u2019s rare that everyone is right.  At some point there will be a new funding cycle. People will get excited and borrow again. I\u2019m not concerned about our temporary dip in revenue. The burn is what retained many of our investors for years. Even through Black Thursday, one of the most challenging times we had to face as a community, we held through it. Yes, we did mint, and MKR suffered but has recovered since. As it stands, though, we still have the mint risk but no burn to counterbalance it. This puts many of our holders into a very tricky state of having to weigh underwriting huge codified downside risk with no clear promise of upside. It becomes very easy to justify classifying MKR as an overly risk-on asset during liquidity crunches. Dumping during times of uncertainty is a no-brainer. As each individual dumps, we increasingly expose ourselves to a governance attack. At this point, the illiquidity of MKR may be the only thing saving us from a nefarious actor buying up enough MKR to control the system. None of us want to see this, and given how essential Maker and DAI are to this space and the world in general, it would be disastrous to allow ourselves to capitulate into handing over control of this protocol to bad actors. It\u2019s not just about \u201cwen moon?\u201d or \"number go up blz! Ya, I\u2019d like that\u2026 since I\u2019m super rekt right now\u2026 \u201ccan dev do something?\u201d I wish\u2026 but tha\u2019s not important. MakerDAO is genuinely in a place to change the world for the better. We deliver untold value and self-sovereignty to people in parts of the world that have nowhere else to turn to but DAI. Do any of us really expect them to use UST or USDT? They want\u2026 no\u2026 they NEED DAI. We need to retain our community at all costs to succeed. Complacency right now will be the end of us.   Burn So, in part\u2026 I understand why we shut off the burn. We had extreme slippage, and it appeared like we were just wasting money. The slippage was terrible, yes. It\u2019s a consequence of our community kicking the can down the road about implementing any sort of marketing-making scheme\u2026 but it is what it is for now. If we burn, it will be with slippage. The other argument for not burning was that we need to save DAI in the treasury to accumulate for a true Black Swan. Maybe??  It just so happened that as that sentiment creeped in and we decided to pause burning, it was at the exact bottom (so far, knock on wood) for crypto. Yes, I know Macro fell more later on. Anyway, we got all flustered and cash happy at arguably the worst time to hoard cash. Although it may seem like everything is dumping, as it stands, BTC and ETH are just holding a steady uptrend. (Yes, I know it looks ready to go to zero any day now\u2026 but how else does a market shake everyone out?) Basically, we started hoarding cash when it was time to deploy. As the market continues to appear worse and worse, we continue to hoard. Regrettably, no amount of hoarding will protect us from a Black Swan if one is coming. The SB will be drained instantly, MKR will be minted\u2026 and nice knowing all of you! At these prices, though, do we REALLY lack so much faith in our project that we wouldn\u2019t buyback and burn when it\u2019s undervalued by at least two orders? Finally, IMO, all price action below $2,000 MKR can be directly attributed to removing the burn.  Burn Options There are several ways we can restart burning.  Option I Restart the old burn mechanism immediately, with all inefficencies and just accept the losses to slippage.  Puase burning when we enter a new funding cycle and/or once a new tokenomics model is developed, has community approval, and is ready to be implemented.   Option II Restart burning at a slower rate. Instead of a hard burn with high slippage, burn slower.  Puase burning when we enter a new funding cycle and/or once a new tokenomics model is developed, has community approval, and is ready to be implemented.   Option III Assuming we do keep a burn model, at least in part, down the road, we can design a very efficient burn model based on sentiment counter trading. I\u2019s not very complicated. I\u2019ve tried proposing it a long time ago, but it didn\u2019t seem to gain traction. The basic premise is to accumulate DAI for Aggressive Growth during manic market phases, and burn during fear and capitulation phases. These phases are fairly easy to identify and don\u2019t require much data. If we do opt to retain any kind of burn model, I would be happy to contribute here.  Not listed in poll.      Restart the Burn?     Yes I: Burn MKR with all the DAI in the Surplus Buffer above the $54M threshold. (Borrowed from @JustinCase)  Yes II: Burn MKR at a reduced rate to mitigate slippage. Details TBD in a discussion.  No: Burning is inefficient, a waste of capital, and its value add is negative or imperceptible. The decision to pause burning has already been made. Abstain     0 voters     This poll will run until May 12th. 2022-05-01T00:00:00Z\u21922022-05-12T11:00:00Z If successful, an on-chain vote will be held to confirm the changes.  Next Steps  If we do opt to temporarily (or permanently?) restart the burn, whether in part or in full, we should focus on fully developing a new tokenomics and revenue distribution model complete and ready to go for a seamless transition from one paradigm to the next. Everyone should put a post-it on their screen, or tattoo onto their forehead: \u201cNever again switch up a narrative at market cycle bottom.\u201d  It\u2019s great to experiment with new ideas, but save that for the euphoric stage of the market. There\u2019s a lot more forgiveness in those times.     Final Thoughts I know the burn model we had wasn\u2019t perfect, but I hope I\u2019m not talking to a wall here. I want to see Maker thrive. If there\u2019s something so much better we can implement right now, then sure\u2026 but we\u2019re notorious for moving slow. Aggravating? of course\u2026 but it\u2019s how we\u2019ve built our reputation. Every change and upgrade is checked twelve times before being implemented. We build to last, but let\u2019s not bleed our talent and community. ",

Example parameters:  Minimum Surplus Buffer: 50m Dai Minimum Delay: 36 hours  This means that any time the surplus buffer is above 50m and no flap auction has been started from this module for at least 36 hours, anyone can kick off a flap auction. Other than the different kickoff conditions the flap auctions would be identical to the current ones. This gives MakerDAO the ability to set a minimum rate of MKR burn so long as the Surplus Buffer does not fall below the specified level. Given the sample parameters above, this would burn 7.3m Dai/year, at a steady pace, keeping the burn alive without putting a cap on Surplus Buffer growth. ",

Rather than burning the MKR without adding value to the protocol, we could put it to use in a range of productive ways.

The burn works best when you have a lot of earnings to consistently plow back into the protocol.  The problem is that in order to grow, we have been increasing spending and reducing earnings.  So we have less cash flow to allocate to the burn and we\u2019re preparing to either borrow or dilute in order to get a 250k or 300k SB.  So to restart the burn, you\u2019re talking about either changing the growth plan or basically borrowing to buy MKR because anything you spend to burn is going to be needed to be borrowed back in order to get the SB we\u2019re targeting. I\u2019m not exactly surprised MKR\u2019s value is dropping because in general riskier assets are getting hit harder in this market.  As you pivot to growth, there will be increasing execution risk and you\u2019ll have to start proving yourself with increased revenue from all these RWA efforts.  To me, the ship has sailed on growth since we\u2019re just not going to be offloading all these new expenses.  If token value really gets cheap, I think you could argue for directly buying and burning with the intention to reissue at a better price\u2026but I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re really there yet.

You\u2019ve been stuck without revenue growth (even decreasing numbers) for a good amount of time now and spending is up.  But your one saving grace is that you\u2019re still profitable and that means you should stay solvent barring catastrophic circumstances. What MKR really needs more than a buyback program is to show increasing revenue that proves its growth strategy.  When investors see that, I\u2019m certain they\u2019ll be ready to jump back in.  No one is going to jump in for the buy and burn if the earnings keep decreasing because when you get to 0, there will be no more buying whether we want it or not. ",

                    "content": "I respect your thought-out response. I agree, though. On paper, burning from a dwindling treasury seems ludicrous. We have about $70M in the SB. The market is contracting, revenue is falling, and our expenses seem to be getting out of hand\u2026 it\u2019s doom and gloom in every direction. Not just for us, but for everyone in every market and at every project.     Traster_Tray:  I want the burn back at some point\u2026   At which point exactly? When there is more clarity in the market? When uncertainty has subsided, and things are going well? It may be ironic, but that\u2019s precisely when we should not burn. That would be the time to build the treasury.     Traster_Tray:  If token value really gets cheap, I think you could argue for directly buying and burning with the intention to reissue at a better price.   What exactly would you define as \u201creally gets cheap\u201d? Clearly, $1400 isn\u2019t cheap enough\u2026 is it $1200? $900? $500? How many more of us will capitulate on the way down to those levels (if we even get there). Will we even have a team left by then? We can pretend all we want that price doesn\u2019t matter. Everyone will stay because they love the project and it\u2019s their passion, etc. That\u2019s a fantasy. Everyone responds to what\u2019s going on in their own way, each with individual risk tolerances. We are already beginning to suffer the brain drain of those that have mentally checked out. They feel their passions and efforts have been for nothing, especially when they look around and see their peers abandoning them. I refuse to capitulate but watching everyone else do it while I sit through the pain is not the most rewarding feeling tbh. Yes, I\u2019m grateful for the support I receive from many in our incredible community, but everyone has their limits. If we continue to pretend the price drop is not a factor, we will inevitably continue to bleed talent. Retaining talent, retaining our community, retaining our investors\u2026 that should be, IMO, a priority. Without them, we cannot succeed. Also, if we allow the price to fall far enough, we truly begin to expose ourselves to a true governance attack. MakerDAO is unique in this space. We\u2019re the bedrock of DeFi.I can imagine all kinds of nefarious parties that would love nothing more than to execute a hostile takeover. From that, we will not recover.     Traster_Tray:  I\u2019m not exactly surprised MKR\u2019s value is dropping because in general riskier assets are getting hit harder in this market.   There\u2019s nothing to be surprised about the drop right now. Any investor is underwriting $10b of mint risk if we have another solvency crisis. The counterbalance in return? It used to be the burn, but right now? Nothing.     Traster_Tray:  What MKR really needs more than a buyback program is to show increasing revenue that proves its growth strategy.   I\u2019m all for a buyback & make program (if it\u2019s ready to go live)\u2026 and I\u2019m also all for an Aggressive Growth strategy\u2026 but there\u2019s a time and a place to pivot to that. Right now? Global sentiment is clearly biased towards hoarding cash, arguably to euphoric levels. Of course, we can adopt that mentality ourselves and follow the masses\u2026 but, in my experience, I tend to find it\u2019s more common that everyone is wrong all at once.  Call1024\u00d7768 118 KB   I would call the bluff.   The goal of restarting the burn here is to signal to the community and our remaining investors that we are not abandoning them. That we will honor the original revenue distribution model we had while we work on implementing a better model in the future. I understand that we can only burn so much with the cash we have on hand, but the signaling is most important. If we had focused on growing the treasury instead of burning during the manic phases of the market, the situation would be different right now\u2026 but it was it is.  As it stands, it appears that this vote will be passing with Option II. This leaves us with about $20m to burn. I suppose we can employ a DCA-type burn? It\u2019s challenging to place an exact timeline, but\u2026 I would probably lean towards a constant daily burn that we continue to deploy until ETH breaks above $3800-4000. In an optimistic scenario, we could see that by mid-late May, at which point, we would taper down the burn. 0f course, that assumes market expansion, which implies more revenue as people borrow more, so we\u2019d have more revenue to burn even harder (assuming mania hasn\u2019t set in). If my math is correct, we should burn about:  $500-700k MKR per day      Traster_Tray:  Borrowing to buy MKR   I never considered this\u2026 sounds risky. I think other protocols have done this or do this. My gut tells me to shy away from this, but I would follow @Primoz\u2019s advice if he believes this is a good idea. ",

I think we should focus on building DAI demand, expanding on all possible chains, working more with vault users, attract more vault users besides, the rates for vaults are not exactly attractive maybe you can adjust something there, showcasing ourselves more, and not just focusing on the fact that we\u2019re burning I think we\u2019re wasting almost 20 million DAI with this action.

Buying back MKR and using it to fund innovation via grants or \u201cacquisitions\u201d (Token swaps like facilitated by PrimeDAO) is much preferable to simply burning tokens. The ideal MKR value accrual mechanism would support North Star and other groundbreaking initiatives and not distract from them by applying a form of a band-aid. Yes, number should go up.

This would be extremely surprising to me, because the majority of other DeFi projects have been doing the opposite of burning for the last two year - expending supply via airdrops or liquidity mining. If they are out performing MKR doesn\u2019t this mean we should focus more on growth instead of burn? It could also be true that the burn mechanism is completely irrelevant to the price movement as other factors carry much higher weight. Let\u2019s assume that MKR is dropping faster than the market. This essentially means that investors think other assets are a better opportunity. Turning burn back on would only give them exit liquidity and ability to sell at a better price and protocol burning less MKR in the end. Financial markets and the global economy are currently in a very uncertain situation;  Due to covid mandates, we have seen the largest expansion of money in modern history which had a large impact on financial asset prices including crypto, which is now in the phase of correction as seen with many stocks.

This is why we generally recommend signaling on a single issue, with the vote options being Yes, No, and Abstain. Options should be clearly labeled and a direct following of your summary.

Moreover, burning MKR now might be perceived as a good move but in reality, it probably only stems the bleeding and results in a slower fall. The price action has as much to do with wider market sentiment and that\u2019s just how markets go. I\u2019d recommend we burn when our P/E ratio becomes respectable again (either via earnings or via price action) and if Risk is satisfied that we have enough to cover serious protocol issues.

                    "content": "So I\u2019m getting the feeling that the impetus behind this is the price action so let me show you why price might not look as cheap as you might think.  MKR\u2019s revenues hit around 150 mil December last year.  What\u2019s interesting is that expenses had also ramped up quite a bit last half of the year and the price actually peaked earlier than the revenue peak.  This is because markets are forward looking and you could say the market predicted the peak.  The price around this time was only around 2300-2600. Right now our fee revenue is now down to 75 mil and although it has stabilized here for awhile, if the crypto markets go further down, these fees will get hurt as well.  So what investors see is the opposite of growth.  Valuation wise, you\u2019re over 18 times sales and depending on what you think our expenses are at maybe 35-40 times earnings.  Maybe these ratios should be lower if you factor liquidation income.  But 18 times sales is expensive in this market for even adequately growing businesses (look at ratios for tdoc, zm, docu) so you\u2019re really only where you are because of earnings and a decently strong balance sheet with no debt.  You might be held up a little by people who see and believe the potential of the RWA push and vision.  But if revenues continue downward and earnings dry up, I can easily envision a much harder drop. Back in December, I wanted capital to be returned because we had so much money coming in, it was more a question of where the money would go.  But now, we make much less so even if you turn the burn back on, you\u2019re going to get weeks of nothing when the big expenses get incurred on the SB.  Plus the SB is a critical component of growth plans so returning capital might be seen as detrimental to growth.  The problem right now is the growth trend\u2026not the loss of capital return. All that being said, I could see value in a partial burn because it shows the intention to return/share capital.  It means if we do get growth, people can see potential for bigger burns.  But right now, a partial burn, depending on how it\u2019s setup, would barely cover the mkr being vested by all the CUs so it\u2019s really only a symbolic gesture until growth returns.  Mkr supply still goes down because we use mkr in the treasury but eventually that will run out and you\u2019re going to be issuing the vesting mkr. ",

DAI demand is driven by our team\u2019s ability to deliver and promote MCD across all markets. We could take shortcuts to deliver sooner, but cutting corners is against our ethos, imo.

If you say YES to this - you basically are saying no to Aggressive Growth and quite possibly saying yes to flopping MKR later at even lower prices to pay the bills.

But DON\u2019T waste DAI funding the FLAPPER. DeFI now offers DAOs much better tools to invest capital that earns return and satisfies DAO goals, the flapper mechanic is completely outdated and a waste of resources. Take DAI and buy some ETHDAI v2 LP (600bps return) or 2x the return (to 1300bps) and go for ETHUSDC v2 LP but please don\u2019t piss away capital on burning MKR until MKR builds a SPF that is earning solid returns.  Both of these build resources that Maker can use in it\u2019s own vault to borrow DAI.   Once we have investments with a return then we can talk about taking some % of those returns and consistently buying and burning MKR. With respect to Wintermute Maker could still pop out it\u2019s own MKR-DAI v3 LP that buys low and sells MKR higher - while earning returns.   You all keep complaining about lack of MKR liquidity well what the heck do you think buying and burning MKR does?    Destroys MKR liquidity.  Do something, but don\u2019t just destroy MKR for nothing.   Use it to build LP and earn fees.   God maybe we just get some trading going if the DAO puts up some v3 MKRDAI LP on Uniswap. ",

We may not need to burn all excess capital, but we should show commitment to returning value. Right now we show no commitment, promise the moon and so far fail to deliver. When we are reviewing and setting up the legal structures in RWA we are taking every precaution that money is returned and generate revenue for the protocol. Why are we then so opposed to pass this on to the ultimate beneficiaries of this protocol? A commitment to growth without a similar commitment to pass that growth in revenue on to the MKR holders is meaningless to a potential investor. ",

Yes I agree. @brianmcmichael mentioned in the chat that PECU have some code to market-buy MKR on Uniswap. I am sure that if we ask PECO to design a specific solution to some well-defined goal, they will be able to do that. In my opinion using the DAI to fund a MKR/DAI pair on Uniswap, to finally try to fix the terrible liquidity MKR has, and earn fees on it, is probably better than burning at this stage. ",

If we use our cheaply purchased MKRs for vesting, put them in a \u201cvesting vault\u201d and don\u2019t burn them, we will not reduce the number of existing MKRs and we can reduce our future labor costs. Another thing I have long wondered about the \u201cMKR liquidity shortage\u201d is why would fewer MKRs cause a liquidity shortage in the market? A single MKR can be broken down into many decimal places, as can its value. Where is the problem here, am I missing something? ",
