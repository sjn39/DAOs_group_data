In addition, if someone wants to publish privately-obtained info, they will do it elsewhere anyway. But then regular forum members will be split between those who read the info elsewhere and those who did not, creating an \u201cin-the-know\u201d club, with no easy way for those who don\u2019t follow the right channels to get that info since posting links to them here will also be disallowed (logically).

I think it\u2019s pretty clear from responses in the other thread (including Will\u2019s own decision to retract the screenshots) that most people agree private conversations should not be leaked on the forum. @ChrisBlec is right that people will not share private chats lightly, but I disagree with him that we should encourage people to \u201cfeel OK about sharing [leaks] broadly\u201d. As the other thread shows, leaks don\u2019t tend to drive fact-based debate or thoughtful discussion. They act as a lightning rod for ad hominem arguments and sock puppets piling on. Of course, there should be a process and allowance for whistleblowing if a CU observes illegal/corrupt behaviour, but that\u2019s a pretty high bar, as it should be. Feeling uncomfortable about private confidences being divulged publicly seems like common sense, not censorship. ",

So if a post with private conversation screenshots are posted without the full context (i.e. edited to show a small portion of the full picture), community members should have the ability to flag and take it down. Another potential option is for posts containing screenshots to trigger a quick review from the GovAlpha (or other team that reviews flagged content) team to confirm with the author that they feel the privacy violation is necessary, that way the content can be assessed and gives the post author a recommendation but ultimately its up to the author to take the recommendation or not. I am not in favor of censorship but I do think we should protect the forum from becoming an unproductive channel. If someone wants to post screenshots there are other channels to do so, Discord or Twitter may be more appropriate, but the forum should be protected from this unnecassary drama. Also, the last two screenshot forum posts have been taken down (the screenshots) by the authors, it shows that its an impulsive decision and after reflection is not the right thing to do. ",
