What if token contracts included a built-in mechanism to move tokens between contracts or even between blockchains? Abstract tokens define a simple, standard way to:   Mint tokens off-chain as messages  Reify tokens on-chain via smart contract  Dereify tokens back into signed messages  Abstract tokens are free to mint off-chain but preserve on-chain composability. They are compatible with existing standards like ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155, and are designed for high-volume use cases such as:  airdrops POAPs / receipts identity / access credentials  Please check out the EIP or Medium post. to see more.
