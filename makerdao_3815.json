                    "content": "Overview    [Signal Request] Raise SF On RWA When Issuers Unilaterally Change Terms   I guess that everyone agree that being slow is shooting ourselves in the foot (the last change in rates for crypto vaults decided 3 weeks ago and yet not in effect). Are we in planning to be slower than TradFi?   I totally agree with Seb. The timing between the rates change group and the actual application of the rate is way too long. Currently to pass the PPG changes, the process is some thing like : 1 week on the forum, 2 weeks on the poll and than another week for the executive with something between 3 to 4 weeks in total. As the committee occurs every month, the change of the rates happen just before they are deciding the next rates, which is not an ideal. I am proposing to shorten the timeframe by cutting the poll and passing directly to an executive vote. The executive will be a separate executive just after the PPG forum post (1 or 2 days after). The executive will have a life time of 2 weeks. Why overall the post forum is just informative and can\u2019t change the parameters. The poll is just a yes/no which is similar to the executive. The 2 weeks time life will let 2 weeks minimum to see the market reaction before the next committee. If the executive doesn\u2019t pass that let 2 weeks to the committee to contact Mkr holders to understand why and change the strategy. Pro  Shorten the reaction time  Cons  Less notice time     PPG Process change  Yes, we need to shorten the timeframe by going directly to executive vote. Yes, we need to shorten the timeframe in some other manner. No, we do not need to shorten the process. Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The poll will run until the 2021-07-08T00:00:00Z, this will result in a review of the process. The next step would pursue an amendment to MIP46. ",

It\u2019s probably not possible to create a process that is both robust and low risk during routine operations, and also able to handle exceptions and critical edge cases with high flexibility. The better solution is to escalate and use special processes, such as the urgent signal request, which are designed for emergencies and critical situations, when such a critical situation arises. ",

To summarize the issues are the following:  No \u2018abstain\u2019 option. Closing date is fixed. Poll options are not worded in a neutral manner.  I would also encourage you to make changes to the \u2018Next Steps\u2019 section.  Add a date for the signal poll to end. Think more carefully about the next steps.  The next steps here are kind of important, because the way PPG\u2019s work is defined in MIP46. The relevant sections are probably:  Discussion - Parameter Proposals must be presented with enough of a feedback period to give the community time to respond and discuss the proposal. Questions, concerns, or queries must be answered if brought up by the Maker community, and feedback must be considered before finalizing the proposal.   Parameter Proposals are first presented on the Maker Governance forum and are then entered into the weekly governance cycle by the Governance Facilitators. Where possible, Parameter Proposals should be made public on the first Monday of the month for inclusion into the weekly cycle in the second week of the month. Sufficient time must be given for discussion, and inclusion in the weekly cycle may be delayed by the Governance Facilitators if they feel more discussion is required. Proposed Parameter Changes will be bundled into a single on-chain poll for inclusion in the weekly cycle, and if the outcome is favorable, will proceed to that week\u2019s executive vote absent unforeseen circumstances. Urgent or emergency proposals from Parameter Proposal Groups should follow the existing guidelines for urgent or emergency proposals.  Changes to the process for PPG\u2019s would require modification to this MIP. I would suggest that if this signal ends successfully, the next step would pursue an amendment to MIP46. ",

                    "content": "So with that out of the way, let me come to the actual contents here.     alexis:  The timing between the rates change group and the actual application of the rate is way too long. Currently to pass the PPG  changes, the process is some thing like : 1 week on the forum, 2 weeks on the poll and than another week for the executive with something between 3 to 4 weeks in total.   Generally those in the group agree that it\u2019s taking too long. But lets be specific about the timing and what causes the delays, the current situation is:  5-7 days - forum debate 3 days - polling 1 days - gap between poll and executive 1-5 days - Executive time-to-pass 2 days - GSM Delay 0-3 days - Office hours  All told this comes to: 12 days - 21 days Now, we have a few options here, lets start by cutting the debate time to 1 day (which is about the minimum notice we need to put something up for polling.) We get to: 7 days - 15 days And finally if we want to go the whole way we can skip straight to executive (again 1 day is the minimum notice for us to put it in the executive), which gets us to: 4 days - 11 days Both of these changes would improve the timing to some extent, but lets not kid ourselves that it gives us an instant response time. Much of the delay is down to the speed with which MKR Holders (or in the future, delegates) vote on the executive.     alexis:  I am proposing to shorten the timeframe by cutting the poll and passing directly to an executive vote. The executive will be a separate executive just after the PPG forum post (1 or 2 days after). The executive will have a life time of 2 weeks.   Frankly, this is a bad idea from a governance perspective, for a couple of reasons:  PPG\u2019s are not elected, anyone can create one and make proposals. Skipping directly to executive means giving anyone who wants it permission to add arbitrary parameter changes to any executive vote. Having multiple executives active at the same time is dangerous. MKR gets split between them and it lowers the threshold of MKR required for a governance attack.  If governance does want to further empower PPG\u2019s I would recommend removing the required discussion time prior to the poll. This would save us 4-6 days in the process. I would remind everyone though, that this change would apply to all PPG\u2019s present and future, regardless of membership.      ultraschuppi:  IMHO the problem of \u201cthis is taking too long\u201d is not big enough to shortcut the usual process, as long as we have the shortcut by mandated actors!       Replenish2030:  It\u2019s probably not possible to create a process that is both robust and low risk during routine operations, and also able to handle exceptions and critical edge cases with high flexibility. The better solution is to escalate and use special processes, such as the urgent signal request, which are designed for emergencies and critical situations, when such a critical situation arises.   I would agree with the above.      Replenish2030:  However in hindsight I think the real solution would have been to make an urgent signal request right when we saw the new reality that we\u2019d need to adjust to, and the damage it would cause us to not adapt in time.   This is more or less the correct answer. Internally the group did discuss taking action prior to the usual time. In actuality, the group did make it\u2019s proposal 1 week earlier than was scheduled.  In retrospect, we could and should have moved it up an additional week - and in the future we\u2019ll be more responsive. However, the issue here is that it\u2019s more or less impossible to know if a market movement will be sustained or reversed as it happens. In retrospect using the urgent signal process would also have been a valid option, and we\u2019ll consider using that more liberally in the future.  ",

Following your comments, effectively this seems a better solution. The discussion time prior to the poll won\u2019t change the parameters or the decision. In any case the parameters change will go into the poll. As it is a recurrent event either we thrust or we dissolve the committee. ",

If anything, we need to lengthen the time it takes for a small group of individuals to decide behind closed doors to alter the expected revenue of Maker by tens of millions of DAI. Does Maker stand for decentralization? Decentralization involves openness, transparency, and due process. It does not involve the power to cut rates in half being held in the hands of an elite few, rushed into polling the very day it is proposed \u2014 proof that no discussion was necessary in minds of those proposing it. Never was there even an informal poll to see if pushing Maker onto a money losing path was worthy of debate. I ask again, is Maker for decentralization? There is no space for even further empowering small, self-appointed groups who do not even feel compelled to comply with the very MIP their group was formed under. Vote no. The process is already too closed  and too rushed, with power to swing Maker between profits and loss vested in the hands of a few. ",

Also you raised an important point, the only way to solve the issue of having a governance attack on the rates is to automate them and integrate them into the protocol. Like Lusd or compound. More generally, any part of maker which needs human interaction is vulnerable. Same as collateral emboarding or other parameters. ",

(8) Be worried about the propriety of any decision - raise the question of whether such action as is contemplates lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echolon.  If MOMC overshoot with the rates it will just overboost DAI supply (resulting in some PSM drain, wouldn\u2019t that be great!?) and we can increase slowly (!)  the rates and be happy about earning more money while having more DAI in circulation.
