I think you might need to monitor the \u201cnote\u201d events, to get the hash to lookup slates in the mapping. Technical docs for Ds-Chief can be found here. The @data-insights-cu might have an API endpoint where you can fetch the spell addresses off chain. An example of this is the Vote Tracker. ",
