It would also be really nice to one broken down by underlying collateral (ETH/WBTC/USDC/Others). In other words, group all the ETH ilks together, all USDC ilks + USDC PSM together, etc. I think that would more clearly illustrate what people are intuitively looking for when asking \u201cWhat backs Dai?\u201d and what Dai holders would receive in Emergency Shutdown.

You can now access the website directly using the same link https://backeddai.makerdao.network/ I\u2019ve simplified it a bit to keep it consistent, not talking about the collateralization ratio given that Dai users are not necessarily affected by it, as it\u2019s more a risk management measure for meant for vault owners.
