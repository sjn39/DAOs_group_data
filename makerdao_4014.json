The webapp runs at https://delegates.makerlabs.one/.  maker-delegates-overview1960\u00d7540 45.6 KB   Context In order to increase transparency around the recently introduced Maker Delegates, the idea of a small webapp was born at short notice, which should give interesting insights at a glance. It is an absolute POC, which has been created on the side in the last couple of days. First feedback has already been received and incorporated.  Overview The app is a single page application that does not have its own backend. Especially in the decentralized environment, in many cases there is no longer necessarily a need for a standalone backend. Of course, this is not true for all use cases, but especially in this case it was absolutely not necessary.  maker-delegates-overview2960\u00d7540 37.1 KB  As you can see in the overview, the application makes use of publicly available sources and links and aggregates them. The complete logic is executed within the application on the client.  maker-delegates-overview3960\u00d7540 62.8 KB  The user interface is very simple. It offers two main views: an overview of all delegates and a detailed view with the corresponding polls and execs. The delegate list contains various details about a delegate and an overview of the activity: participation in polls and support of executive votes. The order of delegates is derived from three factors:  First of all, the Exec score is compared. Here, the factor between supports and available execs is compared. If the value is equal, the average duration is compared. The next comparison is made according to the same principle as for Execs but on the basis of Votes. If the first two criteria do not lead to a clear result, the status is compared. Delegates with the status recognized are listed above delegates with the status shadow.  Feedback is of course very welcome! Have fun! ",

Let\u2019s take @Planet_X: According to metrics.md, the start date was on August 9, this date is used as the basis for considering Execs (and Polls) for @Planet_X.  The last supported Exec was on August 6 (so it is before the start date).  planet_x_tx1409\u00d781 14.8 KB  The start dates are taken as a basis so that the dates can be compared more fairly. No delegate should be disadvantaged because the official start date was later than another delegate. This applies to delegates with the status recognized. The situation is different for delegates with the status shadow. Here the contract creation date is used as start date. Hope this helps! ",
