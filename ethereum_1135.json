                    "content": "I am working on a Medium article about Smart Contracts Sharing Common Data. Here is an illustration from that article, for a hypothetical example multi-contract solution, with a Router contract, a Producer contract and a Consumer contract: 800\u00d7450 65.2 KB The Router must contain the data for all smart contracts. The subordinate contract functions are invoked by Router using delegateCall. Each data struct is located in the Router contract, but is located at a random slot along these lines: contract QueueDataLocation {     function queueData() internal pure returns (QueueData storage qds) {         uint location = uint(keccak256(\"queue.data.location\"));         assembly { qds.slot := location }     } }  This contract may be used as a base contract by all the contracts which need to access the data. In the example, that is the Producer and the Consumer. I think that this pattern for sharing common data will be very useful for many multi-contract types. That certainly includes EIP-2535: Diamond Standard which specifies this way of sharing data amongst the facets of a Diamond. But I think that this technique is more general than that and deserves its own EIP. Any comments gratefully received. ",
