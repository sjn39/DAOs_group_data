Following conversations at EdCon in Toronto, there\u2019s a clear need for a gathering specifically focused on smart contract security. Here is my best attempt at outlining what I think this event would look like, as well as my open questions. Goals To share knowledge to prevent and mitigate security risks facing smart contract systems. I\u2019m particularly interested in anything that improves the working relationship between auditors and developers, and the outcomes of working with a security audit firm. Topics For best results, the scope should be well defined, and strictly enforced.   in Scope  Secure development lifecycle  especially how auditors can work with developers earlier (not doing security at the end) Auditing standards, techniques and best practices   Security analysis tools Formal verification in practice Risk mitigation Upgradeability Running a good bug bounty     Out of scope  Protocol governance Security of protocol client software Crypto-economics and game theory Product/service sales pitches which are not educational, or fre   Event details Timing/Location: August or September, at a time coinciding with another major event which would attract the right audience. ETHBerlin is a good candidate. It should be before, or after the primary event. Not concurrent, or as a sub-conference. Attendance: Attendance should be skewed towards the security community, with healthy representation from high quality developer teams. I think this should be small-ish, in the range of 40 to 100 attendees. Format: I really don\u2019t know.  An unconference format might work, but I\u2019m least opinionated about this, and think it will figure itself out during the organization process. Open Questions  What\u2019s the right format? When/where should this happen? Can the goal and scope be refined?  Who can help make this happen?  I can help by reaching out to the security and dev community, provide input on curation, facilitation, topics of discussion, etc. I do not have bandwidth to organize logistics, or the kinds of activities the require a lot of quick email response.

A blend, where people self-organize ahead of time on wikis and get dedicated slots, and then leave room for day-of discussions. I think the other learning from walletconf was WAAAAAAY more open time for digging in and having extended discussions, and then breaking out into working groups. Including pair programming, demos, whiteboards \u2013 whatever is needed. More working sessions, less presentations. We still have to do work on the Summer Magicians meeting for what an agenda looks like over two days. Day before / day after ETHBerlin so it doesn\u2019t overlap with \u201cmain\u201d activity would be good. @maurelian great job in clearly saying that you can\u2019t do lead organizing duties.

I am happy to help support a lead organizer in figuring out / iterating \u201chow to run working groups\u201d \u2013 especially as this event gets planned in parallel with the Summer Meeting.

The game theoretical analysis is something that should be included in the specification (in my opinion) and explain how the different assumptions being made play into the design and lead to different outcomes in the code. Being able to quickly appreciate the design from this angle is definitely a part of the audit. Whether or not that design will actually meet it\u2019s goal is really something external to an audit. I think that\u2019s a different skillset, which requires simulation results and data analysis of real-world data to confirm. Auditors can only confirm logical consistency and correct implementation of the mechanism ultimately, unless they really want to get in the weeds on the design. This is ultimately the \u201csecret sauce\u201d the designer brings to the table, I think for an auditor to do their job, they can safely assume the mechanism is well-intentioned. ",

If a contract is designed to prevent X, and it succeeds in preventing X, but you can make Y happen which is an automorphism to X in terms of its functional properties, then in effect you\u2019ve failed at properly trying to prevent X. To me that\u2019s still part of security, and doesn\u2019t always have to involve simulations or data. A trivial example would be a token contract that doesn\u2019t allow transfers for N days, but that allows the loophole of contracts being able to buy tokens which can then issue trustless futures wrapper tokens that the owner can automatically redeem for the underlying \u201creal\u201d token once the token contract allow transfers. From a code perspective, a simple \u201cpause\u201d on the transfer function would be correct, but would fail to actually prevent the effect of balance ownership changing hands. ",

Update: Capacity of Full Node\u2019s event sp\u2026     @mariapaulafn I was hoping that we could present a summary of this event to those in attendance at ETH Berlin at a talk given during the event. There is a lot of interest to attend, but we would like to focus this event for more invested individuals and teams. I think giving a presentation would allow others to learn about what we discovered after we\u2019ve had a chance to digest our findings for the wider community. We would then suggest that those who do not currently work full-time either on smart contract development or as smart contract auditors consider attending that session so we can save more space for these parties and create a high level of discussion.

We just deployed the first version of our smart contract system to mainnet a few weeks ago (https://github.com/livepeer/protocol) with plans to make improvements over time. In addition to the topics already mentioned by others in this thread, I\u2019m also interested in discussing how security requirements and audit processes can be scoped to take into account the stage of a system. For example, what mental framework do others use to determine the minimum level of security required to deploy an alpha version of the system in order to start testing certain assumptions about human behavior (given that a lot of the contracts that developers deploy will be mechanisms that assume some behavior in response to the rules of mechanisms that will not be observed in practice until they are live) knowing that the system will be upgraded potentially often in the future? Given that this is likely going to become a more common case in the future, can we transform the relationship with security auditors such that they become on-going partners as opposed to providers of one time stamp of approvals? These questions are motivated by a broader question which is what are the best practices that can enable smart contract developers to get some of the benefits of iterative development while still upholding a high level of security?

This is a great point of conversation about expectations!     yondon:  [W]hat mental framework do others use to determine the minimum level of security required to deploy an alpha version of the system in order to start testing certain assumptions about human behavior[\u2026] knowing that the system will be upgraded potentially often in the future?   For me, I believe you should be testing out those mechanisms as well as you can through simulations, user behavior studies, and testnet trial periods (backed by real ETH, if incentivization is desired) before putting that code on the mainnet. You could do this before or during a security audit. Upon a successful audit, you can move this alpha test to the mainnet, where you should gradually increase your risk as you gain confidence in the proper operation of your contracts. You can achieve this through \u201cenvelope expansion\u201d that you personally shoulder the risk for. This means that the amount of valuable assets you handle through your framework should be limited in some way to this comfort level based on a risk assessment, and only increased as you feel comfortable with it\u2019s proper operation. It should only grow beyond your personal capability to shoulder the risk when you have achieved that level of comfort in it\u2019s proper design throughout the range of capabilities you\u2019ve designed for. I call this the \u201cpublic bug bounty\u201d portion of your contract system (isn\u2019t this what all smart contracts are right now?). This is where I think insurance would be handy, as a means for shouldering that risk and providing an assurance that you are capable of repaying your users in case an unintended event occurs. Over time, insurance will naturally limit the envelope as I was describing. Upgradability should not be a shortcut for this process, you still have to do the majority of your effectiveness and design considerations up front, with upgrading your contract to be considered only in a normal improvement cycle if a vulnerability is found later or new functionality is to be added. You should have a plan of action for this, how often you will check for new vulnerabilities and how you will handle them if discovered. Auditing should definitely be a part of this upgrade process as well, with new features receiving a full audit. (small changes should at least be peer reviewed, and vulnerability patches should receive enhanced attention) We should get much more into this and discuss what a maintenance/support plan looks like. This might include something like instructions for white hats who discover vulnerabilities (and maybe even a continuous bounty program for privately communicating vulnerabilities). These should also be disclosed to the wider group of developers and auditors for assessment of existing contracts.     yondon:  Given that this is likely going to become a more common case in the future, can we transform the relationship with security auditors such that they become on-going partners as opposed to providers of one time stamp of approvals?   I definitely think this is worth discussing further. The concerns here are that there must be a sufficient separation between the auditor and the developer or the relationship will not be effective. There is nuance here that we can work between, but one thing I\u2019ve mentioned previously is checkpoint events along the development cycle, where auditors are invited to review plans for implementations before going too far in the design process, to avoid making costly mistakes early on in the design process. This is similar to the waterfall or V model of S/W Engg, which (unlike agile) focus on getting things right earlier before expensive layers of testing and audit happen (which mitigate even more expensive \u201cevents\u201d).     yondon:  These questions are motivated by a broader question which is what are the best practices that can enable smart contract developers to get some of the benefits of iterative development while still upholding a high level of security?   I think this is one of the main questions we want to answer at our gathering: how do we ensure more consistent and robust security? ",

                    "content": " Upon a successful audit, you can move this alpha test to the mainnet, where you should gradually increase your risk as you gain confidence in the proper operation of your contracts. You can achieve this through \u201cenvelope expansion\u201d that you personally shoulder the risk for. This means that the amount of valuable assets you handle through your framework should be limited in some way to this comfort level based on a risk assessment, and only increased as you feel comfortable with it\u2019s proper operation.  I definitely agree that leveraging simulations, user behavior studies and testnet trial periods are crucial before hitting an alpha release on mainnet. I\u2019m curious what you imagine envelope expansion would look like in practice or if you have any examples of well executed expansion processes in mind.  Upgradability should not be a shortcut for this process, you still have to do the majority of your effectiveness and design considerations up front, with upgrading your contract to be considered only in a normal improvement cycle if a vulnerability is found later or new functionality is to be added.  I agree that upgradable contracts should not encourage developers to skip over executing a thorough design process before implementation/deployment. Although, I do think centralized upgrade mechanisms could also be another way to naturally limit envelopes. During an alpha, centralized upgrade mechanisms enable more efficient bug fixes and improvements, but at the same time also drastically change the trust model of the system. As a result, perhaps users would be more hesitant to allow the system to handle as many assets early on. This is like a \u201ctraining wheels\u201d mode for the system during an alpha (this is what we are currently doing for Livepeer) and once the system reaches a more mature stage, the upgrade mechanism might be executed via a more decentralized process.  This is similar to the waterfall or V model of S/W Engg, which (unlike agile) focus on getting things right earlier before expensive layers of testing and audit happen (which mitigate even more expensive \u201cevents\u201d).  While this model has the nice property of avoiding expensive \u201cevents\u201d, I do also see the downside in executing on expensive layers of testing and auditing up front only to realize that certain assumptions were wrong and that the deployed mechanism, while logically correct, does not achieve something valuable or meaningful. Although the agile model of development might not work for smart contract development given that it represents a much different paradigm than other forms of software engineering, I\u2019d be interested to see if we as a community can nonetheless borrow some of those ideas around validation of assumptions and combine them with the more robust security practices that might be found in the waterfall model of development. Perhaps the idea of checkpoint events you mentioned could be a starting point. ",

                    "content": "I think of upgradability in the same vein as governance:     yondon:  once the system reaches a more mature stage, the upgrade mechanism might be executed via a more decentralized process.   This could be a migration over to DAO control of the upgrade process through user voting. The developer would be an important signal in this vote, but ultimately control is left to participants.      yondon:  I\u2019m curious what you imagine envelope expansion would look like in practice or if you have any examples of well executed expansion processes in mind.   The idea is to limit risk at each stage of experimentation. What is the specific goal of each stage, how is it successful, what future stage does it enable? How can I prove this in the least risky and most useful way possible to prove my goals? How much actual money needs to be in this system to be proven successful? Similar to:     yondon:  I do also see the downside in executing on expensive layers of testing and auditing up front only to realize that certain assumptions were wrong and that the deployed mechanism, while logically correct, does not achieve something valuable or meaningful.   A point I would make with this is that there should be a more structured way of identifying whether the mechanism will work with much smaller stakes (i.e. before an audit or on a smaller codebase). It also goes into the upgrade process as you work on your platform and determine the mechanism at play is not sufficient to achieve the goals that are set. I think my ultimate point is to have a better plan up front for validation of assumptions in smaller steps than the full-on application dealing with the largest amounts of value. You are hinting at this as well in this quote:     yondon:  I\u2019d be interested to see if we as a community can nonetheless borrow some of those ideas around validation of assumptions and combine them with more robust security practices\u2026   This is very much the right tradeoffs to be considering, in my opinion. How do I create a plan of action that is flexible enough to respond to changing conditions as I learn more about my application, yet robust enough to respond effectively to those very same changing conditions under the unique demands of the Ethereum network?  The reason why I\u2019m asking more questions is that I think the answer is unique to each different application. The real answer, in my opinion, is better planning and documentation so we can do a better job communicating with others of our own intent so we can get excellent feedback from the largest possible amount of knowledgeable people to be successful. And also be extremely clear about how much money actually needs to be on the line to prove success, otherwise it will be more money than you anticipate, more so than your risk model will support. ",

How can I prove this in the least risky and most useful way possible to prove my goals? How much actual money needs to be in this system to be proven successful?  Agree that these are all crucial questions to ask. In my opinion, more concrete examples of what this type of envelope expansion looks like in practice with specific applications would also be helpful reference educational material for developers. As you mentioned, the right process will likely look different from case to case, but just having a set of reference points that demonstrate what secure staged experimentation for applications might look like could teach people a lot even if the approach you choose to take ends up differing a lot in the end. Perhaps one of the short presentations at this gathering could be focused on trying to walk through the design of these stages for one or more examples with the subsequent discussion focused on extracting key techniques and common themes?

Our interest at Parsec Labs is to enable games where funds can be held in custody, and the fair execution of game rules can be verified on chain. The holy grail would be to allow more Plasma bridges that validate sub-chain, as described in the original Plasma paper. Until now I can say the the latter 2 are probably not possible without additional constructions like a PoS set of notaries, or similar, due to the data availability problem. ",
