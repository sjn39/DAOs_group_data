We all want tons of DAI in circulation and MKR to be highly valued but this is not going to happen by itself, the value is going to have to be built partially by being where the action is - trading pairs.  Why this now? Because I believe the old model with pairs of DAI/ETH or MKR/ETH on some centralized exchange is in fast decline. Reported volumes are already comparable, while in my experience real liquidity on Uniswap for MKR is way better than either Coinbase or Binance. Other defi tokens (UNI, Link, Aave++) are not that far behind and I am not sure I trust those Coinmarketcap volume figures anyway. On top of this we have cross-chain bridges in the form of wrapped BTC, renBTC and a whole host of other bridge startups, all trying to bring the value and wealth of other platforms into Ethereum defi.  Uniswap liquidity profit727\u00d7273 54.7 KB  And as if that Molotov cocktail was not spiked enough we have Ethereum L2 solutions coming in like a herd of wildebeests. L2 could lower transaction fees by a lot and further amp up crypto to further heights. Defi summer of 2020 could lead to the 2021 L2 event. In the background the printing presses at the central banks are working nightshifts to increase the money supply. Together the combined effects of the transition from centralized exchanges to defi, increased bridging and L2 solutions have the potential for tons of action. Out of this fray I want DAI and MKR to emerge as winners, but that is not going to happen by itself. From the above research it is immediately obvious that volume matters, concentration matters and the more liquidity the better. This is a call to arms I believe that if we are going to profit from this emerging situation we need as a minimum to have functional trading pairs where it matters. Right now this is not the case. The path BTC->ETH->DAI/MKR works on Binance but for Uniswap it is more BTC->WBTC-USDC->DAI->MKR. This is the defi equivalent of visiting an outhouse in Mongolia. We need to get our tokens closer to the action and the way we can do this is through effective trading pairs. Deus vult we spend a week or two discussing what pairs are important, what pairs can be won and then we all, whales and sardines, chip in to make it happen, preferably before Uniswap V3 launches and most certainly before L2 trading starts.

This is also one of the reasons why I would like to see an even higher SF on UniV2USDCETH-A compared to UniV2DAIETH-A   Honestly given the current situation regarding stablecoins and the DAI PEG I think a healthier attitude would be to be welcoming to all clients.   The point here is that just because someone has their capital in a particular pair is no reason to slight them for borrowing DAI.   SFs are a risk premium.  If you want to use it to drive users to preferentially select your service or product one does this with potential long term PR as well as business hazard. In general over the decades I have found an exclusive attitude to be a turn off and potentially to stifle business growth (or worse encourage competitors) where as an all business welcomed and equally served here to be better for long term success. Hence I would suggest a change in language regarding this to be more positive of DAI and less dismissive or punishing of alternatives from a PR and business perspective and try to restrain the temptation to punish alternative stablecoin users via SF. As to MKR-DAI pairs etc.    I have pointed out in the past the inherent contradictory nature of providing liquidity (to earn return) against locking liquidity in governance with respect to securing the system.   This is compounded with MKR being a deflationary coin.   It leads to significant concerns about market breadth and depth should a dilution event occur again.   Which shouldn\u2019t be necessary if one adopts a DSR-L/B model to back the system surplus with effectively a longer term DSR deposit facility that earns a fixed rate over term to fill DAI system losses until the surplus can recapitalize.   This is a much cheaper, less risky, and probably significantly less expensive and generally better approach to managing capital needs when the system is stressed. I am both a DAI and USDC user for many reasons.  I have about a 50:50 mix on these in the protocol at this point but if Maker continues to punish people for no real reason other than a preference from a business interest.   I will over time seek to find more friendly alternatives and move away from Maker and DAI generally. I expect many people who are in the ETH vault that got a SF bump  (because it is felt that they can take it) while the wBTC SF drops to zero pretty much are feeling the same way here. Keep in mind there are people at the ends of these decisions.  I expect those people completely understand and appreciate changes to the system from a risk management perspective, but will look more and more unfavorably if this becomes a kind of coin phobia or system greed that increases rates for no legitimate systemic reasons. My point here is sure you can make changes that way, but it is rather bad form to diss on the competition to pump your product.  Make your product and service the best and there will be no need to act or speak in adversarial manner about any other product. ",

Loopring\u2019s current problem is liquidity. Low liquidity means low volumes and low volumes mean low profits for LPs and hence low liquidity. If this is worth doing, Maker can fund liquidity mining incentives on Loopring (over and above their own liquidity mining plans) and boost liquidity on any of the MKR-ETH, DAI-ETH and DAI-WBTC trading pairs. In particular, it would be great to see DAI become the defacto stablecoin on Loopring over Tether and USDC. I am involved in the Loopring community as well and can help bring the two projects together, if there is funding available for this initiative. ",

Hence L2 is primarily Rollups today, formerly it was also Plasma, Channels, etc\u2026 all mostly considered these days to be dead end designs due to their limitations. Having said that, a lot of people, including Ethereum Foundation here Layer 2 scaling | ethereum.org use Layer 2 as a \u201ccollective term for solutions designed to help scale your app\u201d, and that would include side chains. This is wrong IMO, as tokens bridged to side chains (say xDAI, BSC, SKALE, Polygon) do not differ much from tokens bridged to other L1 chains (like Avalanche, Solana, etc\u2026). They are all \u201cwrapped\u201d tokens and their security is a lesser of the security of the wrapped token implementation, security of the bridge and the side chain itself. If you compare it to \u201ctrue\u201d Rollup L2, the security of L2-DAI (say on Optimism or Starkware zkRollup) is pretty much the same as L1 DAI. Long-term there is no doubt in my mind which solution would I personally choose (or advise big fund mgr to choose) to securely store and trade their DAI. That\u2019s not to say that there is no value from trading, say maticDAI on maticSUSHI or borrowing/depositing maticDAI on maticAAVE, but this is not that much different that trading on any incentivised centralised (i.e. not decentralised) exchange. Yet another consideration is to tap into the value locked in the native L1 assets (AVAX, FTM, SOL, hey, even DOGE, why not). These could either be brought into Ethereum (like BTC-WBTC) or we could imagine having Maker on these L1s minting DAI directly on, say, Avalanche/Fantom chains. But that\u2019s the topic for another discussion I guess ",

So in that sense they are super useful but long term it is hard to see their future unless they will re-implement themselves as Rollups.   Agree with whole discussion here regarding terminology.  FYI:  Already discussion and preliminary work to fold xDAI into a Rollup. Biggest issue here with the sidechains and interoperability is starting to show up.  4 versions of DAI and having to have bridged liquidity and overall liquidity fragmentation. I have a real issue with putting MKR on any of these to provide liquidity with respect to degrading L1 Maker security (taking MKR out of L1).   I really think the focus should be on L2\u2019s as properly described by @bartek\u2026 (thank you for posting that as I was already starting to come to this in my head - but your post cleared the terminology in my thinking nicely). I think a real discussion of incentivizing MKR liquidity for system backstop liquidity against L1 MKR for security purposes is in order here as I can easily see MKR making its way into bridges which may open up unexpected attack vectors.
