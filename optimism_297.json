Yes Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: February 1st, 2023 Ecosystem Value Proposition:   we disrupt the creative service industry by eliminating centralized agencies and making one protocol for all.   we develop sustainable solutions for creating content.   we help web 2.0 creators bootstrap their web 3.0 projects and crowdfund them with community   our advisors are top-tier consultants in art, fashion, tech, and architecture.   we\u2019ve been working as freelancers, and producers for over 2 decades, so we know all of the current flaws in the system.   Number of OP tokens requested:  1,000,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No Proposal for token distribution: The token  500k OP awarded to cover a brand new MVP on Optimism 300k OP awarded to cover the marketing of the platform 200k OP awarded to cover onboarding of top 1000 creatives in the United States ( multi-disciplinary artists)  Timeline: MVP - up to 2 months from receiving the fund Onboarding 1000 creatives within 1 year.  Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?  We will estabilish a demand for services on-chain. For example Digital Fashion brands need UGC content that can be produced on-chain with photographers from our platform. ",

                    "content": "Thank you for the feedback @Niki and @maykung   We are open to suggestions about how much $OP should be distributed. The MVP (minimum viable product) needs to be sufficient to be able to work natively on-chain using the Optimism protocol. Once we build it we are going to integrate it with 0xsplits, Velodrome, and other protocols from the OP ecosystem   We plan to provide as many incentives to grow the overall OP ecosystem as possible. As I mentioned above after the basic MVP is established We want to add 0x splits, let users mint directly to OP flagship NFT marketplace, and provide liquidity to projects via Velodrome and others. This project will be modular, but because we\u2019ve been creating digital content for the biggest AD agencies since the beginning of the internet - we know how to execute this task and bring value back to the community of creators.      What are the criteria to become the top 1000 creatives? Why do you limit the incentives to only the creatives in the United States?  We don\u2019t want to limit ourselves to the US, but we hoped to focus on one pool and grow the network effects from here. Our team is in New York and LA, but we also have a strong representation in Korea, Singapore, Poland, Croatia, Thailand, Taiwan, Canada, Argentina, Puerto Rico, and many other places. Anyone from anywhere is eligible to apply. Applicants can come from all creative categories and intellectual pillars: fashion, music, design, technology, art, film, animation, gaming, VR/AR, sustainability, and on. Young Creatives play a critical role in creating culture, driving innovation, and building wealth \u2013 particularly in marginalized communities. Yet, we know that Creatives who are women, people of color,  and members of the LGBTQ+ communities face distinct challenges that stem from systems, structures, and practices designed to exclude and preclude them from being successful. Without the ability to invest their own wealth, the result is that businesses owned by entrepreneurs from these communities are overleveraged or are unable to access capital to invest in growth. \u200b We have established a Curation Committee (+50 curators at this moment) and would love to add strategic curators from the Optimism eco-system as well.     > What marketing activities are you planning? What are the purposes of the marketing activities? Will they be benefit to Optimism ecosystem and community?   We are planning to launch multiple IRL events where we would showcase the works of our users.   We would like to design an entirely new website and UIX with our advisors from Spotify, Peloton and Rainbow Wallet.   We want to offer grants and discounts to creators who make services on-chain rather than through a centralized agency. This will eliminate the need of having a traditional agency representation.   We will give small grants to top fashion photographers who can shoot content for Digital Fashion brands IRL.   some OP tokens will be granted to creators who build on-chain content for OP-based Dapps   ",

Can you please explain this a bit more?  COINBASE  - this could be anyone (SME businesses/Dapps), but here more of a symbol of the crypto native brand or corporation, Someone who hires a lot of freelancers or needs content. Assuming that Coinbase will grow its user database there might be a need for projects like ours to help freelancers work in web 3.0 ANNA  - freelancer, creator CRNFT - we are the Dapp that makes it happen.

This is an awesome proposal and it\u2019s great to see such an innovative project/team building on Optimism. The problem is that OP Governance Fund funding is generally aimed at already deployed projects with an established track record. That said, this seems like a perfect candidate for funding through the Optimism Foundation directly. Here is a quote from this post about it:    OP Governance Update #1 \u2014 June 9, 2022   If your project is looking for funding to bootstrap new development, we recommend that you either  (a) reach out to the Optimism Foundation here  to inquire about partnership funding, or (b) structure your grant proposal to earn tokens for your project after hitting specific milestones, deliverables, or on-chain metrics.    So the best way to get funding at this point is either apply for funding through the Optimism Foundation here (what I recommend) OR restructure you grant request in this forum. In order for the second to work, the funding would likely need to be post-milestones of deployment and usage given that this is a new project. I hope that\u2019s helpful and I\u2019m happy to answer any questions you have.  ",
