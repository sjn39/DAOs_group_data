                    "content": "Hello, while MKR is mooning, the \u201cstrategic patience\u201d people in MakerDAO\u2019s chat are rationally talking about the Surplus buffer. Some discussion is already going on in separate threads regarding the need to increase the SB to keep up with the larger amount of DAI minted (now >1.3 billions) and with the need (soon, when the Foundation will dissolve) to self-sustain the DAO (read: salaries). Today @NikKunkel wrote in the chat:  plus we could always reinvest funds in the surplus buffer to earn yield\u2026 since theyre not user funds but protocol funds  Which makes a lot of sense. @LongForWisdom wisely replied with:   So having them in compound or Aave sounds bad, because it directly makes our competitors cheaper. Having the buffer + PSM funds as DAI-USDC uniswap tokens seems nice.   I started this thread to collect good ideas along the lines of: how can we invest the (inactive part of the) SB? I start with my 2 cents. IDEA: As a variant of what @LongForWisdom proposed, it might be cool to LP on Uniswap the MKR/DAI pair. So, concretely:  Use some of the money of the SB to buy MKR (this is separate from the burning mechanism). We then become Liquidity Providers on Uniswap on DAI/MKR.  Benefits:  MKR gains liquidity, of course, which is always a good thing. Unlike other forms of investment, which are questionable (everybody could say: nah, just give me my share and I will invest it by myself!), this investment does the good of all MKR holders, increasing liquidity. Since MKR holders\u2019 goal is to vote to increase the value of MakerDAO (and therefore of their MKR), all MKR-holders should be considered as bulls on the MKR/DAI pair, hence LP this should make sense for all MKR holders. Finally, of course, we get the LP-fees, producing the desired yield. Additionally, if the MKR token goes up in value, the LP tokens gains in value (vs the initial investment measured in DAI) and so we get even more gains.  Risks:  What could go wrong? The MKR token goes down in value. This means that our LP tokens loses value (bad news) but it also means that it represents a growing and growing amount of MKR (>50%) vs DAI (<50%). Well, if the loss is judged too heavy, we can return the LP-tokens, collect the MKR and burn them (feeding the burning contract instead of buying MKR in the market) so overall it\u2019s not a terrible deal.  Anyway, this was just a random idea  @LongForWisdom\u2019s idea is much simpler and basically risk free, so arguably better. I am curious to see hear other ideas. ",

                    "content": "Yeah basically we could alter the flap to basically buy MKR and then pair the next 10K DAI and put it on uniswap.   I think it is a fabulous idea actually because then we earn a return on the surplus while providing liquidity.  MKR goes down in price we end up with more MKR and basically can opt to burn it. (we end up paying less than just straight up buying and burning it) and we earn some return to boot. I also thought supplying DAI/USDC was a good thing suggesting uniswap but curve may be more appropriate since these are both going to be pegged 1:1 there is little risk of IL loss though now with PSM in force this may not get much volume.   The key point here was to make sure this liquidity doesn\u2019t get locked up. I really like the idea of doing this with the DAI that is going through flap.  flap 1, buy MKR, take second flap and pair the DAI with MKR in a LP contract.   buy and burn like 3(or N times) more MKR, then do the buy and pair into uniswap again.   Change N based on the MKR price in a clever way and one gets an element of MKR price management as well.  ",

The strategic reserves is not the best way to achieve anything here. It might have a small role to play in the case of ES but we can hardly call it a priority. I mean, that works but it doesn\u2019t leverage the main power of Maker: DAI.  Balance sheet manipulation is now strictly a better way. Significant work remains to be done and my hobby time is not enough for that. Uniswap DAI/USDC is probably the best option to start with.  I really want to highlight that using smart vaults (or whatever the name should be for those active automated use of our balance sheet) is the most promising aspect I can see for Maker in 2021.

Personally i think that is where we should be focusing our efforts atm in order to get that off the ground.   We should begin to look at what the goals should be of such a strategic reserve fund.   In my own work previously I believed such a fund should act as:  Fall back for DAI liquidity in the case of a negative surplus (fill a surplus gap before flopping MKR).  Hence I see such a fund as seeking not just return but also retaining or increasing DAI value by putting assets into protocols that were 100% liquid.  (which is an argument for why we shouldn\u2019t use ETH-DAI or MKR-DAI btw) To use this fund to build a return for the protocol which then would be used to burn MKR.  Regarding any ideas of what to do with such a fund perhaps we should focus on the goals for such a fund first in a community sense as these goals are going to drive what we invest in. ",

Personally I think a surplus reserve should have as a key component DAI value preservation, high if not total liquidity (when we need it we want access and to not screw up markets or worse having it impaired somehow), with return generation being important but distinctly less important than capital preservation.
