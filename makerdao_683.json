                    "content": " Protocol Engineering Month in Review: January 2022 Hi everyone, Protocol Engineering along with the other Core Units have kicked the year off with an impressive amount of work - there is so much going on! The following post details the work PE has completed over January as well as providing a bonus look into the structure of future initiatives to give an all round understanding of accomplishments, prioritisation and future plans. Please let us know if you have any questions!  January Executive Spells   14th January - Recovered DAI from Optimism Escrow, made changes to Uniswap LP Vault Debt Floor Parameters, and completed Delegate Compensation  21st January - Made MOMC Parameter Changes and Decreased the GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A Liquidation Ratio  24th January - Temporarily Prevented Surplus (flap) Auctions and MKR Burn  28th January - Supported Core Unit Budget Transfers and Streams  Two other points worthy of mention:  The ESM delay (moved till 3rd Feb) was necessary due to the extensive number of authorizations and de-authorizations that this module requires. It also included ESM optimisation via the inclusion of a circuit breaker thereby no longer requiring de-authorization of every contract where the ESM is an authority . Similarly, it also included a comprehensive list of tests to ensure correct operation and was as usual deployed on Goerli with the necessary updates before going to mainnet. As raised on the forum, PE made an error with the payments of two streams, which has since been rectified, however we are documenting a post mortem to improve our processes and handoffs that will be shared shortly.   Executive Spell Clean Up Tasks  A lot of work has gone into optimising spells-mainnet for consumption by multiple teams, namely enabling Collateral Onboarding to be done in its own code branch before being merged into the executive for any respective week. This is important because it seeks to eliminate merge conflicts and set physical boundaries between repositories that may be undergoing edits at the same time. Our next steps in this space are to work with GovAlpha and other core units on optimising the existing poll/executive cadence for the involvement of more than one team interacting with the codebase. This effort is also linked to the post mortem mentioned above, with the aim of optimising spell processes and security.   L2 Multichain Environment  Successful retrieval of 10M DAI on Optimism: Execution Plan and recovery  Conducted the [MultiChain DAI Strategy](MultiChain DAI strategy - discussion materials - Google Slides 46) and presentation on the Community Call. Next steps will be to align with Risk on documenting risk parameters for rollups and sidechains. Hosted regular Stakeholder Alignment Meetings held every Tuesday on the Maker Calendar  Participated in multiple team reviews with StarkNet CU for peer review and side-by-side code comparison against Optimistic rollups for functionality understanding. This will help PE better articulate community recommendations regarding the StarkWare initiative. Completed Formal verification specifications using Certora which are now ready for internal review. Audits are ongoing as mentioned in the audits section further below.   DssCharter - Institutional Vaults  Parameters for Nexo\u2019s ETH and wBTC vaults totalling 1.5B DAI have been set with Growth and Risk. PE is currently wrapping up audits on the DssCharter contracts to enable institutional vaults. This technical design is a scalable solution that can be adopted by other institutions with minimal tehnical PE input. Beyond the audit, our next steps will be to review Nexo\u2019s technical integration - PE intends to lend resources and/or auditing time due to the size of the vaults.   CDP Register Functionality & Discussions  Held multiple discussions with frontend UIs and the community which helped identify required feature functionality for a rewritten dss-cdp-registry. This was necessary to determine how vault IDs can be reserved from a CDP manager and shown in front end UIs. This contract is currently pending audit.   Dss-crop-join Enhancements  Updated dss-crop-join (facilitating generation and distribution of token rewards) to support behaviour with the end contract and emergency shutdown. An audit has been completed and will be published shortly.   Testing and Standardisation  Introduced a standard slot pattern in DssVest with slot test coverage to be used as a template for future dss modules. This will allow integration and simulation testing/fuzzing via mutations at the bytecode level allowing us to apply formal specifications. Next steps are to complete a review of Echidna action and corpus caching.   Chainlog Improvements  Documented Chainlog improvements for how deployed contracts can be better tracked. Added scripts in dss-chain-log to ensure a consistent on-chain changelog for MCD   Compound D3M  Continued working on a modular D3M implementation for Compound. The new architectural design was warranted due to the existing Aave D3M being highly coupled to the Aave implementation and the need to make a new solution scalable to multiple future implementations. This modular design will split out rate targeting and DAI management from calculation logic and partner interactions. As a result it will be possible for Maker to create drop-in modules for other protocols that are unit testable while keeping a core D3M contract that handles DAI interactions. Our next steps are to finish writing the module, conduct an internal review, and follow up with an external audit ideally in March.   Protocol Engineering Safety Sub Team  Created a curriculum for formal methods with an emphasis on blockchain applications. The curriculum consists of four courses including outcomes, and exercise sets. Developers who complete this curriculum should be comfortable utilizing a variety of code analysis tools as well as being capable of building their own. Upon completion of this course, developers will be ready to consume and contribute to the growing body of research at the intersection of defi and formal methods. Continued development of specialized tools & content, including a simple theorem prover to enable automated feedback in course 1 on logic fundamentals. Pursued improvments to develop new assurance tools and assist with specifications reviews for dss-wormhole. Our next steps in developing the curriculum are to build out the content and formalize this in the Maker github org, afterwhich we will liaise with the proposed EDU core unit to see if there are alignment opportunities.   Keeper Network Engagement  With the goal of building for redundancy, PECU has been working with multiple keeper networks and completed a number of PoCs proving their keeper efficiency. On the forum this has been evidenced via discussions with the following parties:  TechOps Gelato Network Keep3r Network   For PE this has involved supporting the PoCs and leveraging the capabilities of dss-cron for multiple Keeper networks.   Other Smart Contract Updates and Changes:  Updated the megapoker to accommodate offboarded collateral types Engaged in community discussion which led to the design of a rate limited flapper and forum post. This contract is currently awaiting audit and community vote.  Reviewed CES\u2019s RocketETH Collateral assessment, and liaison with them on a new MIP 21 implementation that we hope to review in February. There is a lot of supporting-contract work that is completed alongside the weekly spells, including:  Added Foundry forge support for quicker testing on spells-mainnet and spells-goerli. Made routine updates to Dss-exec-lib, ds-math, and dss-interfaces to support new executive spells and collateral types.     Roadmap and Upcoming work To help the community get a sense of our roadmap, including work that is currently under review or in audit, the following categorises a number of ongoing tasks that are currently on our backlog.  Currently in Internal Review  Team review of MCD on L2 Tech Spec and addition of risk framework assessments StkETH/ETH clipper callee CropJoin CDP Manager Cure (Debt Rectifier) as referenced in the ESM threshold increase response regarding sending DAI to the contract address.   Currently in External Audit   Curve LP Oracle to support plain pools (3CRV), Lending pools (compound) and meta pools (GUSD-3CRV). Ongoing feedback of the Optimism Wormhole and incorporation into final report Proxy Actions for DssCharter Proxy Actions for Cropper Shared CDP Registry Rate Limited Flapper  Pending auditor availability:  Deco (by the Deco Core Unit)  Events for StarkNet (end of Feb) as managed by the StarkNet Core Unit Arbitrum Wormhole   Currently in Development  D3M Compound (as referenced above) Adding additional functionality to DssExecLib to support RWAs PSM liquidator (the ability to liquidate collateral into appropriate PSMs) New proxy registry to support L2 vaults and interfaces   Ready for Development  Exchange Callees (to support the auctions UI core unit) Internal Review of DssGate (ensuring extensibility across the protocol) StkETH/ETH auction demo keeper DssCharter Auction demo keeper and supporting DssExecLib functions Technical Assessment and Implementation ideas for Maple Finance Exploration of New GUNI pools  There also exist a number of other process and cross-team tasks that will likely require our focus, including alignment with the Security Initiative, the emergency playbook, Defcon spells, and maintaining updates to Immunefi\u2019s new bug bounty,  EthDenver  A number of the Protocol Engineering Core Unit will be present, we look forward to seeing you at the main event, and various side events. Safe travels to those joining!  ",
