I was already looking at ETH DAI valuations to present one but gave up after a short time. I think if there is some focus to discussion it will be to talk about the class of auctions we consider defective (1), and then (2) to decide what we think is a reasonable collateral return scenario under the market conditions where liquidation happened.   My arbitrary (based on my business experience) split the difference between what someone could expect or want vs. what I could expect or want is in the right ballpark (10-12% collateral return) and this is what we saw as a rough average when additional keepers came on line. So unless someone has a really strong arguement for more (perhaps an emotional compensation, since this was stressful for everyone), or less (because really under these circumstance expecting ANY collateral return is a pretty high expectation) landing right in the middle (give or take a few percent) honestly seems reasonable.    Then the issue becomes the auction criterion selection process, but honestly even if one selects all with a collateral deficiency relative to the nominal value chosen the amount doesn\u2019t more than double from left (0-bid) to right (ALL with a collateral deficit relative to chosen nominal). The value of ETH in DAI - that is a whole different can of worms. ",

Below are the  \u201cArguments for compensation\u201d as presented to voters in the previous poll for reference: The protocol performed in a sub-optimal manner. Users (i.e. vault holders) were injured. It is in the interest of Maker holders to try to make their users happy. The purpose of the MKR token is to insure against precisely this kind of failure. No compensation may represent a distortion of symmetry and reciprocity i.e. the impression that we\u2019re marketing the product and receiving the reward for growth of the platform, but leaving ecosystem/development risk entirely to the user. This could negatively impact reputation and future mass adoption. Avoid bad press and acrimonious gestures. https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmwfvvguaf8rz8xwgv2cqnzzt9t5h6epzh17qmk2ue99y4 Compensation done \u201cdown the middle\u201d as suggested or any other fraction may appear reasonable, but will likely not achieve these objectives and in that sense be fruitless since you would have spent a great deal of DAI and still sit with the reputational damage, bad press, injured vault holders, negative impact on mass adoption etc. You would not have achieved the benefits voted for in the first poll. Further defending a \u201creasonable\u201d percentage in front of the press, injured users and potential legal proceedings could be difficult and more so being represented by a collective. The cleanest, quickest route ending the matter and focusing on the future could prove an investment especially considering you are not dealing with a single party you can shake hands with - all you have are your actions signalling intent and impacting brand and reputation. For all these audiences you likely would have to be seen to have \u201cdone all you could\u201d acting in the interest of users and that\u2019s likely what will count in articles written on this issue. Considering the interest in the matter and competition in the space this could be defining for Maker. Having said this presenting too many choices could be misleading and I propose we rather focus on fewer options framing the poll in a way that extends directly to desired outcomes. Otherwise you could be caught in a classic \u201cdecision by committee\u201d trap diluting the question at hand to averages and missing the outcomes altogether. A voter may think 12% is reasonable, but want the outcomes 24% would likely bring if the question was framed differently. This is not a strange concept - giving customers more than is reasonable is basically Amazon\u2019s ethos. The framing of the poll should focus on outcomes and provide limited options. ",

Expecting 24% back is unreasonable in my view. Successful auctions on the day returned around at best 11% of collateral to Vaults. That gives us the best idea of what Vault Holders could have expected had there been enough (but not copious amounts) of keeper liquidity. I\u2019d actually like to split the difference between 0% and 11%, and return 5.5%. Given that responsibility for the outcome is shared between like 5 different entities (of which MKR Token Holders are only one) this still feels more than generous.  On another point those arguments for compensation represent a subset of the communities opinions. I didn\u2019t agree with them as stated, but I still voted in favour. I just want to be clear they should not be considered the canonical source of truth on what the responsibilities of MKR Token Holders are, or what their reasons for voting in favor would be.  Regarding what the poll looks like, we\u2019ll do our best to structure it to capture as much signal as possible, as efficiently as possible. We\u2019ll also try to make sure it\u2019s objective as possible. I\u2019m sure full compensation of 24% will be on the poll. I\u2019m also fairly sure that 0% compensation will be on the poll, given that we now have more information regarding auction effectiveness and the cost of compensation than we did previously, and that this new information may have caused people to change their minds. Probably we\u2019ll see a few options between those extremes too. ",

I think that from the perspective of analysing this data it was just easier to omit BAT. Don\u2019t worry, no one\u2019s forgotten you.     Vault2288:  Personally I think 5.5% is still rather low considering Pre-Black Thursday and before the 0 bid auctions were taking place, the average vault holder was left with 17.7% after liquidation.   True, but normal circumstances are different from the sort of market event we saw on Black Thursday. Personally I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to expect compensation based on the average good case in ideal circumstances. Others may well see it differently though. Like in my mind we have something like this: 24% - Theoretical best case, unlikely in practice unless ETH price appreciates after liquidation but before auctions end. 17.7% - Average good case in normal circumstances. 11% - Best case on Black Thursday with limited Keeper liquidity. 0% - Worst case given 0-bids. Others may agree with you and suggest that 5.5% is low, and that 11% is already enough of a compromise. Difficult to say.     Andy_McCall:  Maybe this is this first thing to be decided then? I.E maybe we need to elect a working group to hash out the details of a plan here and lay out the roadmap.   I don\u2019t think election is necessary. If you are willing to form part of this working group then please make yourself known. ",

This number was displayed everywhere, not only on UIs, but in every Medium article of ETH dev & experts. We can be sure that a big majority of the impacted vault holders were expecting 13% penalty applied on their loan. Remember, if most of vault holders had known that in specific conditions they were going to receive 50% of what they should have received on a \u00abnormal day\u00bb (11% vs 24%, @LongForWisdom comment), they would have taken more care of their vault.

Remember, a class action has been made, it should take months/years to get the final statement and a lot of human efforts. Vault holders that will accept the compensation will not be able to participate. With all that points, me and other victims would appreciate a full compensation in ETH (~24.67% of total collateral).

As I said, I believe the responsibility for the loss is shared between like 5 entities. Imo these are: MKR Token Holders - For setting insufficiently defensive auction parameters. Various UI\u2019s- For displaying 13% Liquidation price without explaining the details. Maker Foundation - For failing to ensure robust Keeper participation and production of appropriate tools. Ethereum Network - For failing to scale well. Vault Holders - For getting liquidated. I\u2019m sure these are open to argument, but this is how I see the situation. The point is, MKR Token Holders are not fully responsible for the loss, why should they be fully responsible for any compensation.     fullname:  that were only explained in the github README.md   https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/liquidation#how-much-collateral-is-left-after-a-liquidation     fullname:  I still don\u2019t understand, as a User, where did you find the 11% and 17.7%?..)   From the report posted in the initial post of this thread. (Though I\u2019ll note I only pulled out 11%, 17.7% came from @Vault2288)  As to the point as why DAI rather than ETH, that would be because the MKR Protocol can mint DAI and give it to you without anyone having to code or decide anything terribly complicated in order to source ETH. Compensation in DAI is likely to be a faster process than compensation in ETH. ",

We\u2019ve yet to decide what ETH price we would use to determine the amount of DAI compensation though. We could use the current ETH price, although I don\u2019t think that is necessarily a good idea either. If I\u2019m reading the report right (@MakerMan please correct me if I\u2019m wrong) to compensate all ETH Vaults at 24% of collateral (~32k ETH) at a $200 ETH price comes to 6.4M DAI. Personally I think it\u2019s doubtful that MKR Token Holders are going to incur that much more bad debt in order to compensate Vault Holders. But again, I could be wrong.     Nielsd:  I dont see a reason the a reason for pulling together a team.   Mostly because things don\u2019t just magically happen. The reason Rich wants a team is because previously the proposed polls promised things that there was no plan in place to implement. Say for example we wanted to compensate in ETH, someone needs to figure out how to get the MKR Protocol to acquire that amount of ETH. The way this works is the Protocol can mint DAI, but then we\u2019d have to use DEX\u2019s to convert. Okay. But then we need to deal with slippage. Which DEX\u2019s do we use? Who compiles the list of Vault Holders and how do we calculate how much we owe each one? Do Vault Holders need to be able to opt out? Ditto for BAT Vaults. If some Vaults do opt out, how does that process work? How does this interact with the class action lawsuit against the Foundation. Furthermore, the people that are sorting all this stuff out need to get paid, because frankly, it\u2019s all work. We\u2019ve never paid anyone from the Maker Protocol before, so how does that work? Payment in advance? On delivery? By hour using a streaming solution? It may sound simple, but it isn\u2019t. ",

Recapitalising the system is the only thing MKR Token Holders are obligated to pay for (by design). It\u2019s also worth mentioning that UI\u2019s in some cases do sell services that benefit from network growth (increased customer base.) I believe DeFi Saver charges for one or more of their services, though I forget which. You could also argue that the Ethereum network benefits from the DeFi projects built on top of it.  It may be beneficial for MKR Token Holders to pay some amount of compensation for Vault Holders in this situation, but they certainly aren\u2019t obligated to do so. I appreciate you are all frustrated, but I\u2019m doing as much as possible to approach this from a position of objectivity and trying to figure out how much compensation MKR Token Holders are actually responsible for rather than giving a knee-jerk response.      uvizhe:  I\u2019d say that the split is between ~24.67% (what vault owners expected) and 10-12% (what should be expected).   Why? Are MKR Token Holders responsible for the expectations of Vault Holders? 24.67% is the theoretical maximum in a system that relies on auctions, it\u2019s not a reasonable assumption to receive that much back. A reasonable assumption is based on historical return in the case of liquidations (17.7%), a reasonable assumption given what was possibly a once or twice in a lifetime event is 11%. Splitting the difference between the reasonable assumption given the situation and what was actually received seems like the fairest outcome to me given that the unprecedented market situation was made worse by insufficiently defensive auction parameters (the thing that MKR Token Holders are actually responsible for).  Like if anyone can provide a solid argument as to why MKR Token Holders are responsible for compensating the full amount given their role in Black Thursday, please share it. Note that I\u2019m talking about responsibility, not what may or may not make sense given PR issues. ",

Is there consensus that compensation can be in DAI? Bear in mind that the amount of compensation is an orthogonal question to the token used to compensate. As LFW said, we could use today\u2019s ETH price to determine the amount of DAI compensation which is practically the same as compensation in ETH.   I don\u2019t get why there isnt a poll for compensation in DAI or ETH/BAT personally. Please don\u2019t get me wrong as any compensation is better than no compensation - It just seems a little bit off as the compensation is regarding how much % of ETH and BAT should have been remaining in users Vaults effected by the 0 bid auctions taking place. To my understanding: A vote will take place with options to what extent of compensation should be made in terms of the remaining % of collateral Vaults should have been left with. MakerMan\u2019s comprehensive report shows us the average was 17.7% before the 0 bid auction exploit became known. Once this is decided each Vault effected by the 0 bid auctions will be remunerated with that % of collateral - be it ETH or BAT so that everyone is equally made up the exact same % of remaining collateral. Perhaps just outlining how being paid in DAI wouldn\u2019t be a disadvantage would help. The way I see it - it would be a disadvantage if compensation were made in DAI when the point here is to restore Vault collateral balances to an equal threshold of remaining underlying overcollateralized collateral.

The amount by which the system became undercollateralized (and the subsequent flop auctions rectified) is also exactly the amount by which vault owners should be compensated, assuming 100% compensation. Given that the price of ETH is going up every day, doesn\u2019t it make sense to repeat the flop auctions, hold the ETH designated for compensation in the system surplus and then figuring out how to compensate the vault owners? If too much ETH is bought in this process (i.e. if vault holders are only partially compensated), the extra ETH can be converted back to MKR and then burned.

In general, what we need is an upper bound on the maximum possible compensation amount in terms of ETH.   So, the amount the Protocol needed to cover in bad debt was equal to the DAI lost in the unsuccessful (net negative) auctions minus the DAI gained in the successful (net positive) auctions. I forget the actual numbers involved now, but it\u2019s important to note that if an auction is successful for the protocol, it isn\u2019t necessarily successful for the Vault Holder due to the 13% penalty. In terms of an upper bound on ETH required, I believe this is just over 32,000, according to MakerMan\u2019s report. And we would also need to worry about BAT.     nr2618:  I understand and it is an interesting question about how to execute this.

I can\u2019t say for certain, but I suspect the Foundation wouldn\u2019t do this, on the grounds that taking part in compensation could be argued to be an admission of guilt in court.  I appreciate the effort you\u2019re going to here to try to come up with novel solutions. But realistically in order for any method of compensation to start happening, someone needs to volunteer to do it. See the working group suggestions earlier in the topic. Doing anything quickly is really difficult at this point, because there are no processes or procedures setup that detail how such things are to be done. We have literally never paid anyone anything using the Protocol, this is completely uncharted territory. ",

At the end of the day we are choosing how to compensate those that took an unexpected loss during one of the most volatile days in recent history due to a confluence of events:   MKR as a system is something we want users to rely on and we as a system need to make it up to those when something goes wrong that was clearly not functioning as intended (even though the users should have been aware of the risks).  It doesn\u2019t mean insuring against all losses, but in this case the keeper system was clearly not functioning properly and as a \u2018business owner\u2019 we should err on the side of the goodwill of our users.   I think we should pay 24.7% (or whatever the optimal amount was) of user losses in DAI valued at the time their CDP was liquidated (best estimate of USD/ETH value at the time).  Whatever happened to ETH value after that event should not be our liability.  I would bet if ETH was trading at $10 everyone would want to be paid in DAI at the liquidation value.  We should make them whole on at time of the loss.  I believe this is fair and definitely more generous than they would have received in keeper system was working as intended given the volatility at the time.  My guess is that this 24.7 packback is somewhere around 1.6mm DAI.  Arguing about whether it should be 800k DAI (11%) vs 1.0mm DAI (15%) is IMO small potatoes for the goodwill benefit of just doing the full amount.  Given the potential of the MKR system over the long run I think we should err on the side of what I think is doing the right thing particularly since MKR system already took 3x the losses of the CDP holders.

The Community alone seems unable to solve the isssue with compensation in a swift manner and the time is playing against Maker and all affected users. Maybe MKR Token Holders can ask the Foundation for help? To help with programming and money to stash ETH/BAT I mean. Also, honestly, I think that manual collateral purchase and distribution is far more simple and quick than programming/testing. The only thing to be done is a simple page asking to sign on-chain an agreement to receive X amount as a compensation. ",

Yes, if MKR holders decide to price ETH compensation at 200 DAI per ETH. The price of ETH in DAI is a number that will have to be decided by a poll. It\u2019s an orthogonal question to how the compensation will be distributed. If vault holders really want compensation in ETH or BAT tokens then that would slow down and complicate the whole process. I can\u2019t even imagine a timeline. Whereas with DAI compensation, we can fund a gitcoin bounty in 1-2 weeks, the contract will be ready in 1 week, maybe we need another week for auditing/verification, simultaneously polls can run to determine the amount of compensation, and then a week to fund the compensation contract with an executive vote. That\u2019s about 5 weeks, assuming everything goes smoothly. If vault holders want to complicate things then it may add 1-2 months to that timeline. ",

To be clear, I don\u2019t expect it to, but it is something I would expect to see as an option in subsequent polls.   Why did we vote at all then? Sorry but you can possibly say that about every point in time. As a MKR and a CDP holder I want to state the following:   The image problem for Maker and the whole Ethereum DeFi system is huge and it is real. Imagine the wave of people coming into the crypto space in this new cycle. A lot of them will be fascinated by the possibilities DeFi is providing for the average Joe. At this time if you are talking about DeFi, you are talking about Ethereum and eventually about Maker and I firmly believe this is a \u201conce in a lifetime chance\u201d. If we don\u2019t fully compensate the harmed vault owners, I bet 5 out of the 10 google results for the search \u201cMaker\u201d will cover this topic. This is an image catastrophy. We have to realize that this is a competition and it is going to be tough. We don\u2019t want to loose against Binance and the likes. On the Binance Chain there is already a project called Bidao which is basically copying what the Maker DAO is doing. I can\u2019t stress this enough. Imagine new customers who have to decide between a Maker CDP and a Bidao CDP and the internet is full of \u201cMaker is a scam\u2026\u201d tweets. What are the gonna choose?   On the official CDP GUIs there was only talk of the \u201c13 % liquidation penalty\u201d. This is highly misleading. Just putting \u201cIn case of liquidation you may loose up to 100 % of your collateral. Learn more here (link to a decent explanation of how the liquidation process works).\u201d beneath would have been enough. I don\u2019t want to point my finger at anybody here, but I can hardly believe this was not intentional.   In this thread there is talk about a compensation between 0 % and 25 % and about whether to take into account the ETH value at liquidation time or the ETH value now. We have to make very clear to ourselves what this means. Let us look at an example. Say a user had 100 ETH locked in his CDP. If he was compensated with 25 % at liquidation time, it would have gotten him 25 ETH which is around USD 5,000 now. But if you only compensate him with say 12.5 % this would be only 12.5 ETH. And on top of that, if you really honestly think about taking into account the ETH price at liquidation time, say USD 100, he would only get back USD 1,250. So it is USD 1,250 compared to USD 5,000 he should get. In my opinion most of the vault owners would say you can keep that USD 1,250 too, join the legal class action, rant on social media and call it a scam. And on my behalf, I could not really say they are wrong.   To summarize this, I think Maker is in an unique and very fortunate position right now in the emerging DeFi space. Competition is heating up and MKR should try everything to avoid this public relations catastrophy. The user interface not mentioning the risk of loosing all of the collateral was clearly a failure on Maker DAO\u2019s side. This was not the fault of the average user. I absolutely can not understand why on earth the ETH price at liquidation time should be taken into account. It is clearly not the user\u2019s fault how long it takes Maker to sort this out. Maker DAO should compensate the harmed cdp owners fully and of course take into account today\u2019s value of ETH. This is not only the best for the harmed cdp owners but also for the MKR holders in the mid to long term. I am myself a holder of MKR and firmly believe in this. ",

Just putting \u201cIn case of liquidation you may loose up to 100 % of your collateral. Learn more here (link to a decent explanation of how the liquidation process works).\u201d beneath would have been enough. I don\u2019t want to point my finger at anybody here, but I can hardly believe this was not intentional.   The information about risks was available to vault owners, in the Oasis terms of service (https://oasis.app/terms) as well as the MCD docs (https://docs.makerdao.com). It seems irresponsible to make investment and lending decisions solely based on reading one sentence from the UI, without looking into the docs and terms of service. I\u2019m personally in favor of making some sort of payments to vaults as a goodwill gesture, but I wish vault owners were more willing to accept responsibility for their actions as well.   I completely agree with this.   I do not have some illusion that IF I fall under liquidation that I \u2018shall\u2019 receive.  It is \u2018may\u2019 and \u2018may\u2019 is caveated on whether an auction fetches a certain value relative to what I borrowed. I like the idea of being able to buy some liquidation insurance.  For me it would simply be to buy some time until I could get some DAI moved to cover some of the debt.   Generally I try to keep my liquiidation exposure risk pretty well moderated with conservative CRs in most cases. I do think that the system should try to optimize against liquidations, and to optimize for return to vault holder in that case.   Adjustments of LR, LF can totally help optimizing return to vault holders.   As to liquidations they are also going to have some \u2018market risk\u2019 involved that could lead to 0 return.   The idea that IF I am liquidated I am entitled to some compensation for collateral lost isn\u2019t going to fly very well with me. Here is what I am concerned about.  After compensation this idea that the system owes people some level of performance otherwise the system will owe them compensation. Lets drop all pretenses from this point forward for everyone.   You can lose all your collateral here.  Go and read the risks for all players in various Maker event scenarios.  If you don\u2019t understand the risks simply don\u2019t deposit.  It really is that simple.   The idea Maker or any other DeFI product centralized or not won\u2019t experience problems in various situations that will eat your capital  - DO NOT KID yourself.   centralized and decentralized hacks/breakins happen all the time.  It WILL happen again.   Spread and minimize your risk against your gain exposure.  This way no one event till crush you financially. imo. ",

I was probably over-reading into it too, for which I also apologize.     benita:  I just don\u2019t think it is right to let the people vote until it suits my opinion.   So this is a fair point, which I agree with in the abstract. However this situation is not the same as Brexit. Imagine Brexit if Brexit was not physically possible to enact without a second vote containing all of the details and the options of yes/no. That is closer to how the Maker Protocol behaves. It\u2019s actually impossible for governance to credibly precommit to anything currently. The best we can do is signal intent at a specific time, with the information we have at that time. The only binding decisions the Protocol can make are through executive votes, and even then in most cases we can undo changes we make (for example to system parameters.) Minting and distributing DAI is obviously something that we can\u2019t undo. But in order to do that smart contract code needs to be written and included within an executive vote.     benita:  I know that but I don\u2019t think it would be right (see above).   This is unfortunately not a relevant point. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s morally correct or not, it\u2019s how the Maker Protocol works. The protocol has not yet distributed DAI (or whatever unit of compensation), up until the executive vote that distributes compensation passes, MKR Token Holders can still back out. The danger of excluding 0% from the polls is that everyone gets blindsided when the executive vote fails to pass because no one realized that sentiment had shifted earlier. We need as much signal as possible at every step of the process and that includes the signal from those that do not want to compensate.     benita:  Can you give an overview what you think are the main challenges?   Okay, so in terms of decision making, we need to decide the following: A) To what level of collateral are we compensating Vaults (0% - 24%) B) What ETH price do we use for compensation (assuming compensation in DAI for simplicity)? Someone needs to figure out: C) Do we need to create a working group to figure out the below? How are these people paid? Who organizes this? D) What are the actual mechanics (in terms of executive spell code) required to do this? E) Who will write this code? F) Do we need a smart contract outside of the executive spell? G) Do we need a UI / Frontend? H) Do we need some sort of legal declaration to exclude those that are compensated from the lawsuit? I) Do we make compensation opt in? Or do we just airdrop DAI? That\u2019s what I have off the top of my head. I\u2019m fairly sure there are things I haven\u2019t thought of. ",

E. g. if we only compensate to a level of say 12.5 %, I think the negative press a la \u201cMaker only pays back half\u2026\u201d will outweigh the positive press a la \u201cMaker compensates vault owners\u201d. Any thoughts on this? I will give my personal opinion on your points below.

That\u2019s what I have off the top of my head. I\u2019m fairly sure there are things I haven\u2019t thought of.   A) We should fully compensate. The money we could save is not worth the bad press in my opinion. We should show some generosity and it will pay out in the long term. B) This would backfire even more. Without doubt it is not the vault owners fault that it took Maker so long to get their stuff done. Please note that this is not neccessarily my own opinion but this is what the narrative will be. C) to I) Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but I think it is the Foundation which may be sued. So I think the Foundation should step forward, get legal advice, and find out if it could get some legal advantage if the MKR holders compensate the vault owners, e. g. that owners who accept this offer can\u2019t take place in the lawsuit. If this is the case I would be happy to help the Foundation by including a legal declaration, opt-in et cetera. I think the legal situation has to be clear before we talk about further proceedings (point C to I). ",

                    "content": "I had a wierd thought but have not looked at this in comparison to any price medianization to use the tab itself as the ETH in DAI valuing mechanism. Rough example: Say a tab is 4K DAI and the Tab*1.13 is 4520 DAI and the lot is 50 ETH.   Say governance decides the return on ETH collateral is 10%. So this means the 45 ETH had to sell for 4520 DAI or putting a tab price at 10% collateral return at 100.44DAI/ETH so the DAI owed here would be 5*100.44 DAI=502.20.   Effective DAI return on the tab in this case is 502.22/4520 = 11.1% Running this at 5 and 20%   we get 47.5ETH     4520      95.15DAI/ETH     2.5      237.89 DAI     gives 5.26% DAI return 45 ETH       4520      100.44DAI/ETH   5         502.22 DAI     11.11% DAI return 40ETH        4520      113DAI/ETH        10       1130DAI          25% DAI return. One can see with the higher nominal collateral return the effective return percentage is higher than the nominal collateral return % simply because the effective ETH price is higher.    Quick look at this is that the DAI return formula is like. NDR (Nominal DAI return) = TAB * NCR / (1-NCR)  where NCR = Nominal Collateral Return. Doing something like this basically removes all the market prices out of it and just focuses the DAI return on the TAB size offered at the time for the auction LOT.   Some thinking would have to go into implications of this vs. a price tab but easily doable from a numbers perspective.   I will take a look at seeing if I can do a table of the above with the data I have.   If someone wants to come up with a good median pricing based on what (time of auction kick/deal) we could compare resulting numbers. EDIT:  I was looking at the above for various tab %'s (columns in the table in compensation report).  The odd one is where people got an actual collateral return less than the nominal that we are making up the difference vs. the ones who got 0 collateral return.   (i.e. column 114 vs. all the other columns). ",

Have to think about market price during liquidation really as this was a rolling and moving black swan event.   back to back 25% pricing drops in 24hours. If one looked at rough averages across most exchanges a rough rolling average low probably would be between 75-80 USD/ETH as an average price bottom.   Vault 2288 had a sell of 2200 ETH in that band while self liquidating. In EVERY vault case given OSM never dropped below 100 - at a $75 market price price no vault would have gotten ANY collateral back. I also want to be clear about what people felt was advertised.   Liquidaiton fee indeed is 13% but if you did one bit of research about what it meant to be liqidated you would also have turned up \u2018at auction\u2019 which never guarantees a price.   IF the live market is > 20% down from the OSM during liquidation those vaults will probably NOT get any collateral back AND the auctions will have been \u2018efficient\u2019.    My point here is that the 13% liquidation fee IS correct, not a mistatement or deception and I don\u2019t believe there was ANYWHERE (please correct if wrong) that guaranteed you would get any collateral back during liquidation - ONLY that the liquidation fee applied to liquidations was 13%. I really would like someone to go find what the actual statements are regarding what happens during collateral liquidation (not just for Maker but all DeFI products) and post them in another forum thread.   DeFI advertising.   I don\u2019t read anywhere ANY guarantees of getting funds back during any liquidations, and tons of risks that say 'you could lose it all, due to smart contract bugs, market risks, liquidation risks, etc. etc.) ",

If we agree on this, we should make it our very own duty to compensate the harmed owners to the fullest extent. If the majority of MKR holders thinks that it was totally ok to not point out the risk to our \u201cusers\u201d, we should not compensate at all in my opinion. EDIT: If any normal company would have run an ad without mentioning that risk, they would have been forced by law to compensate their customers fully, at least in my country.

The Protocol doesn\u2019t have UIs, most MKR Token Holders have had no input on the Oasis design (possibly bar taking part in user research surveys). But to be clear, there is responsibility on MKR Token Holders, but that responsibility is for the auction parameters that led to sub-optimal liquidations in the event of a market crisis. How much responsibility is that? Well in my opinion it\u2019s not zero, but it\u2019s also not the lions share, hence my suggestion that we split between the received (0%) and the ideal-given-circumstances (11%) ending at 5.5%. ",

I spent some time looking and frankly the documentation regarding liquidation risks were reasonably clear to me. Example: https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#maker-protocol-auctions If enough Dai is bid in the Collateral Auction to fully cover the Vault obligations plus the Liquidation Penalty, that auction converts to a Reverse Collateral Auction in an attempt to sell as little collateral as possible. Any leftover collateral is returned to the original Vault owner. In fact the entire whitepaper here is clear on all the system risks and from what I can see was posted prior to MCD release. ",

Also while probably obvious to everyone else but it is not entirely obvious to me the family of websites/domain names controlled by the MakerDAO vs. other ones that are 3rd party built.

Shouldn\u2019t the zero bid column have the largest gap?   Joshua, To answer your first question.  Yes the 114 column totals the collateral return deficit even for auctions that returned some collateral but not the nominal value. Regarding what the columns are:  I didn\u2019t get to discuss the Compensation Matrix very much in the CC.   The columns there are a filter based on the amount of the tab returned.   All columns are less than vs. less than or equals.   If you look at the number of auctions and number of vaults in every column except the 114 the number is identical over the nominal collateral return percentage.   This was a sanity check that how I was calculating the data was consistent and correct.   Literally to calculate the 1% tab return you could take the 1% nominal collateral return and multiply by the nominal collateral return % you\u2019d like to see (17.7% say) and get the exact number.  This is not true if one includes the auctions where full 113% of the tab was gotten but returned less than the chosen nominal collateral return (row) vs. 114% column matrix elements. The reason here is that every vault that returned < 113% tab also returned 0 collateral.   The quesiton was whether we wanted to compensate only the 0-bid auctions (1% Tab left most column) or perhaps we decide we only do everything under 113% (i.e. every auction that returned 0 collateral).   The 114% column though calculates the collateral deficit for auctions that paid the less than the chosen nominal collateral return (row) than AND equal to full 113% tab (column 114).   Example say an auction paid the full 113% tab but only returned say 5% collateral.   This auction and vault would only be included in rows where the nominal collateral return was expected to be greater than 5% and includes this as a difference in the total ETH to be compensated. It means that the total ETH to be compensated as well as number of vaults and auctions changes in that 114% column depending on what one decides the nominal collateral return is (row).  One can select the nominal collateral return row and take the difference between the 113 column ETH returned and the 114 column ETH returned and know this difference corresponds to all the vaults that paid the full 113% tab but did not return the nominal collateral return chosen vs. all the auctions/vaults that returned no collateral.

The tab % filter was simply to make sure I could do this calculation based on some kind of \u2018auction performance filter\u2019  tab, market price whatever\u2026   It was an illustration of technical ability to be able to filter what is included in a compensation analysis based on a kind of \u2018auction performance\u2019. The reason for this was an idea that some people might say, hey the auction returned 100-113% of the tab (i.e. was profitable for the protocol) so why don\u2019t we consider these good auctions.  Just because they didn\u2019t return collateral to a vault holder doesn\u2019t mean the auction \u2018failed\u2019 in some way. As to vault compensation choices and polling.   Basically one has to decide whether to have any additional criterion on the auctions selected to put into the compensation calculation.   I wanted to demonstrate as well as create a spreadsheet that basically could do that selection.    I think if I was going to poll on this conceptually I would poll on a simple question: Do we further filter the auctions or vaults based on some auction performance criterion:   Examples:  % of Tab,  % of Market (say CBP), % of OSM, % of Uniswap or some other criterion or combination of these?

Is it plausable that all auctions could have raised the full 113% of the tab and returned collateral.  Yes, lots of things are \u2018plausible\u2019.  Is it likely?  I think given what we were seeing at different points, unlikely.  But lets move to the real crux.  Your second question. You are right a vault with 150 liquidation price would be less likely to return collateral than one with a 105 liquidation price.   What happened to the OSM contributed to how this evolved. As to people who self-liquidated.   There is no simple answer really on those.   What I can say is that if people tried to preserve ETH one can just look at how much ETH they ended up with vs. how much they started with.   Vault 2288 for example (felix can correct me if I\u2019m wrong) came up with 585.18ETH out of 5005 ETH his own self-liquidation trail is pretty clear.  If I have these numbers right he got 11.69% back. A vault by vault analysis over Black Thursday would be very interesting but also extremely time consuming.   It is something I am very interested in as an analysis project but simply don\u2019t have the resources to even attempt it.   Paying Twicky out of the DAI I received for his nice work simply because I don\u2019t have the technical ability to do the back end on-chain data gathering work.  I am not even sure if the community is interested enough to fund a greater analysis project encompassing these issues even if I had the manpower that could do it.   The goal would be to produce some kind of product one could use to apply to future market or Maker events but I don\u2019t see this as a simple project.   Not entirely sure what we could learn but I think having a greater understanding of what is going on with vaults with a more detailed view particularly during events like Black Thursday would yield valuable information about the system generally.

A locked OSM that when it moved moved no more than 20%. There were no 150 ETH/USD vaults that went to liquidate into a market below $100. I can only say this based on what I see in the data. I have the OSM, UNISWAP, and CBP-H/L on the chart - please do look at it. The discount at auction to market when it was functioning wasn\u2019t as big as you think to the LR.

                    "content": "Thank you for posting that article @Sandhaai I am going to add a main comment.   I still consider myself relatively new here, but I consider as probably the HIGHEST priority of Maker to deal with suring up the auction/liquidation system.   I have refrained from posting my DSR-L Liquidation back stop mechanism simply because some of the recommendations in my liquidation report are base requirements for the DSR-L.  We absolutely need to re-kick auctions if they don\u2019t meet some minimum bid requirements not just in terms of price but also of number of participants. We need to stagger lot sizes in auctions.   This is key to gaining a better scientific view of auction processes. Change how the system operates if the auction price being offered or will fetch is significantly lower than the OSM.  (disjointed OSM to market) I think a review of the auction process itself with a goal of not just doing the least to sure up the system now is important but looking to the future to make a more efficient auction system which is easy to access for the most players.  Literally with the above I\u2019d like to finally just nail down what I consider to be one of the biggest flaws in the Maker system, the liquidation process.   There are others to be sure but this one just stands out at me, probably because of how closely I have looked at the system. Maker community needs to take this seriously and really put some effort into driving this nail down. I am not going to MIPify my DSR-L proposal but at some point I am going to post it for consideration and leave it be.   What I have not done yet is to take the proposal and run it through a monte carlo simulation.   Honestly what I want to do is to just run the data from Black Thursday into it but I have not had the time, yet and the community seems to have its hands full of all kinds of other issues.   One other issue that cropped up from my work is this idea of the OSM and auction market bid/deal prices being disjointed.   This is a condition that needs to raise a flag operationally and ideally throttle or halt processes until the flag condition goes away.   To be sure I have looked at the risk scenarios here with the suggestions I will be making and frankly they are not worse than the ones we have in the system right now. Expect a post at least on the DSR-L at some point in the future.   I think there are so many steps in this process and so much discussion that literally nothing will happen for at least a year and I don\u2019t think the DeFI space can wait.   We really need to fast track some solid approaches that can be overridden or managed manually by governance in a pinch.   12hrs may seem like a long time to wait to do something but if we design the system to be conservative and overly safe as we can by alleviating run-away conditions we already know about (OSM attack is one, black swan is another) we can then provide a solid and well defined operational backstop to the entire DeFi space that will provide a greater confidence to all participants during tail risk type events. The real problem here is everyone wants to run headlong into taking peoples capital and providing a service because it is \u2018cool\u2019 or \u2018necessary\u2019.  If at least one DeFI project doesn\u2019t stand up and say, \u201cwe will go a little slower and more carefully for the sake of the entire DeFI space\u201d, I have serious concerns during another Market crash ALL of DeFI will crash and burn, and everyone will throw up their hands and say \u201coh well, we did our best\u201d and then hope we can rebuild. Heck with rebuilding after the DeFI a-bomb, lets just try to do the best we can to avoid the financial nuke we are building from laying waste to a massively growing but fragile space. ",

When I said \u2018vault by vault analysis\u2019 above I mean EVERY vault not just the ones that were liquidated which would include vault 2288 and all the other vaults saved by DeFI saver, self liquidated etc. I was talking a general analysis of what ALL vaults did on Black Thursday or at any other time.  I totally can do a vault by vault compensation analysis once governance pins down the details and produce a full vault by vault compensation report. I just can\u2019t do that until we settle on ideally the compensation scenario to apply.   Just as expected, discussions about compensating vault owners slowly dies down, until no one remembers, only the people who lost all of their money and will never ever use Maker and will recommend the same to everyone they know. I will post on every forum that people should avoid the Maker system. Maybe centralized stable coins are what this society needs. Nevertheless, thanks to everyone in this forum who put in work to find a solution to this preposterous event! Sorry to see all this good intent be in vain. ",

                    "content": "This is to those who posted afterwards.  @Poligon_Assets @Sandhaai @hsingh21 @Robin_masters I understand everyones dissappointment with Maker.  Frankly I have my own beefs here far beyond what is being expressed by all of you that I endeavor to contain simply because it is my impression that we all have at our finger tips a possible avernue to a completely decentralized banking system.   All of us here are basically volunteers and guinea pigs.   Literally crypto proper - entire space on such a cutting edge that any time I turn in this space I have to realize I could lose all funds to a developer screw up no-one catches fast enough much less a catastropic market event\u2026 The idea that somehow decentralized little Maker is going to be something superior in every way possible and not living up to even doing the most basic things a CEX can do I can see as a great dissappointment to a lot of people. Every bold adventure has it\u2019s share of good people that gave the last measure to see through. When it comes to discussion and status.   The few of us working on this are trying to gather enough working power and organization to move this through the next stages as quickly as reasonably practical.  We can\u2019t even guarantee governance won\u2019t stop us dead in our tracks at some point.  We don\u2019t have huge MKR holders helping drive this train with any guidance or help (personal, financial, whatever) Right now status is such that a working group is forming to try to get a real plan of action in place that has an achievable time frame and a step by step process for governance to move through this to get from concept (voted on at 4/6/2020) to a result.    While any centralized system could just unilaterally move instantly and declare intent as well as back it with funds, Maker by design is decentralized and so by nature and practice is going to move more slowly than any centralized system. Would daily updates on compensation status help people feel better about this?   Perhaps people can comment. Has this whole thing died - most definitely NOT.   Will vault holders see compensation.  Governance has signalled it\u2019s intent, a report finally generated, more people accumulating to work on this as a project. Current status a working group is forming and a master plan is being put together with a pretty aggressive time frame to completion. I am ok with vault holders venting on how slow this is and how they will never use Maker again, etc.  None of this is going to help anything move any faster and certainly isn\u2019t going to fix the issues that still exist in the system now - today. I honestly hope people post warnings not just about Maker but the entire DeFI space because I do not want mom and pop joe six pack trying to use this stuff when it isn\u2019t ready for prime time.   The reason there are high returns, and big money to be made in this space is because it is HIGHLY RISKY.  I cringe at the idea of retirement accounts getting into crypto because these people have no clue how much risk is in this space - both individually as well as collectively.   What I do know is that after everyone bitches about Ma ker, or Compound, or Synthetix, or whatever that with hard work, more blood sweat and lost money perhaps if this space doesn\u2019t entirely implode on itself we might finally create a fully decentralized finance system that is reliable, robust, and the biggest piece impossible to shut down. So if you feel the need to vent - hey welcome aboard go for it - you want to post how this space sucks and Maker sucks - sure - how DeFI can eat ALL of your funds - DEFINITELY but don\u2019t forget to point out that not everyone or everything in this space is screwed up and there is real HARD work being done to realize the vision in the space. What do they say - you can\u2019t make an omlet without breaking a few eggs.  It is my hope that over time MakerDAO creates a system that breaks the least amount of eggs.   I know I have more ideas in my magic bag being buried in this whole compensation plan and data analysis I have not been able to post much less get any traction on the ones I have posted that sit unworked on. I will speak with folks and see if we can get a update thread up where we put in daily or at worst weekly updates on status on this issue and hope that people don\u2019t completely lose sight that all of us in our own ways are trying to build a better eco-system.   It is our job to manage the huge risks here while doing our best not just to profit from the system, but to provide the environment for the system to grow and improve. It is my hope even if people feel Maker has let them down now, that perhaps some time in the near future you will find one or more reasons to give Maker another chance.  The beauty of this space is there are a hugely growing number of choices some better, most worse than others. ",

I don\u2019t understand why this is so difficult - if a compromise needs to be made to compensate in DAI - pick the highest DAI/ETH rate for Black Thursday then provide compensation to those in the liquidation range 763 to 4723 for their full vault values less 13%. If compensation in ETH is required then delaying this settlement may become increasingly more expensive the longer this is delayed. ",
