Should the MATIC vault be able to generate around 30M Dai, this vault would become profitable. Perhaps this is something the Polygon team could assist with. This poll is to determine whether Maker Governance should offboard the MATIC token as it recently has with similar unprofitable vaults including KNC, BAL, COMP, AAVE, LINK-ETH, and AAVE-ETH among others.    Offboard MATIC  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Conditions: This signal will be active for 10 days before closing (11/30/21 00:00 UTC) This is a conditional signal request. I will withdraw the signal request if the following two conditions are met.  The MATIC vault has 20M generated against it There is a commitment from one or more community members or entities to extend the borrow to 30M Dai if Maker Governance were to pass a debt ceiling increase to 30M Dai.  If this poll completes the full 10 days and the community has voted to offboard MATIC, then the offboarding process will resume. ",

However, after speaking with the risk team, they mentioned that they can\u2019t do 100 mn mainly because of less liquidity on the DEX. From there, we discussed that max. they could do is 25-30 mn DAI for an institutional vault, but we did not move ahead considering the timeline was much longer than we anticipated, and also that it was not a community vault. Moving forward, the max. risk team agreed to do was 10 mn DAI DC vault, with an ability to increase it in future and that\u2019s what we agreed and moved forward. Now, we have a separate public vault with 10 million DAI debt ceiling, and we did utilize close to ~90% of it (mainly because it was painful to mint all of it at once). At the same time, we have requested to discuss the issuance of DAI on Polygon PoS. It feels like when we put across the idea of issuance on Polygon PoS, team goes silent. It is one of the most adopted scaling solution, and has good composability in DeFi. Only missing piece of puzzle is MakerDAO. We would more than happy to mint the original 100 mn DAI we request if native issuance is possible as part of the multi-chain roadmap, and I believe there would not be any concern of low liquidity since MATIC on Polygon PoS is fairly liquid. Regarding the commitment, our commitment was to mint 10 mn DAI publicly, promote it and we have committed to it utilising ~90%. There seems to be mis-communication on what was agreed, so I have tried to put the timeline of discussion as it happened. Having said that, it feels like a threat the way Nik has put it forward, and it undo a lot of good work we are working on with Growth unit viz. Mariano, and Nadia on promotion of DAI for Polygon\u2019s different scaling solution. We are here to support Maker\u2019s vision and promote DAI, but don\u2019t feel like such a threat is warranted. It seems like mis-communication between different teams. Eventually, it is a community vault, and all are part of the community. ",

No doubt that what you mention about the inoperability of different chains is a yoke for Maker. Not everyone has the possibility to open vaults of 10k or 25K DAI. Maybe what I recommend and I hope, is that you publish it in the forum, agreements what is working and so, so avoid passing those posts offboarding Nik and the Maker community learn what is doing the Matic Team.

I can only speak to our internal communications which went from discussing 100M Dai to a lower figure of 30M Dai due to the liquidity profile of MATIC. The 30M figure is essentially a minimum amount borrowed the Maker Protocol needs to make a collateral profitable. The Core Units refrain from onboarding any asset that will generate less than this minimum threshold. MATIC was prioritized because it was believed a deal was in place that would guarantee that floor. So I agree with you, maybe the expectations for both sides were unclear, so we can hardly hold that against you. I\u2019ll edit the original post to remove any references to a deal and frame it exclusively from the economic point of view. That said, it doesn\u2019t change the situation that the Maker Community finds itself in where MATIC is unprofitable. This isn\u2019t singling Polygon out, Maker Governance has been very active in offboarding collateral types that fail to meet this floor including USDT, KNC, BAL, COMP, AAVE, ETH-USDT, DAI-USDT, LINK-ETH, and AAVE-ETH. This is likely to continue with the community already having MANA, UNI, and UNI-ETH as future possible candidates for offboarding. If we can get the MATIC vault above the 30M threshold then the vault would be profitable and the Maker community would have no reason to offboard.     sourcex:  At the same time, we have requested to discuss the issuance of DAI on Polygon PoS. It feels like when we put across the idea of issuance on Polygon PoS, team goes silent. It is one of the most adopted scaling solution, and has good composability in DeFi.

Maker currently does not support borrowing of Dai on other chains, and doing so would be a huge undertaking. Whatever may happen in the future with regards to issuance on Polygon PoS is out of scope for this particular poll which exclusively is limited to MATIC on Ethereum. ",

At 3% fees, that would equate to 900k in oracle costs to cover the MATIC vault. This seems contradictory to the estimates you give in the MIP for oracle gas costs \u2013 where OSM + medianizer + spotter is around 500k in estimates. It also seems likely that YFI should have comparable oracle costs, and is a much older vault that is not currently at all-time-high useage. Given that MATIC is only 3 months old, should Maker consider offboarding YFI? Or is there something that makes MATIC specifically a more expensive ilk to provide oracle services for.

However, after speaking with the risk team, they mentioned that they can\u2019t do 100 mn mainly because of less liquidity on the DEX. From there, we discussed that max. they could do is 25-30 mn DAI for an institutional vault, but we did not move ahead considering the timeline was much longer than we anticipated, and also that it was not a community vault.       sourcex:  Regarding the commitment, our commitment was to mint 10 mn DAI publicly, promote it and we have committed to it utilising ~90%. There seems to be mis-communication on what was agreed, so I have tried to put the timeline of discussion as it happened.   Given my understanding here I believe a reassessment would be appropriate.  It looks like the Polygon team wants to move to satisfy Maker demands, but also has goal objectives it would like to meet. I honestly have been watching this vault for a while and wondered why the full 20M DAI wasn\u2019t drawn.  I think there is significant potential with Polygon being missed here. I will vote no to offboard MATIC as I think this would send the wrong signal from Maker to Polygon.   We really need to straighten this out.   Right now we are earning perhaps 1/2 the 600K/yr needed.  It will cost us 75K DAI to give the teams 3 more months to work out some arrangement.   I think this 75K and up to even 150K would be well spent to try to secure a 15B Token ecosystem with Maker.  Polygon could easily become a 100B MC and is one of the largest side chains in operation.

After how many weeks/months should we evaluate each collateral and classify it as profitable or not? Are we going to offboard all collaterals with less than 900k annual fees?   Once we are clear on classifying collateral as unprofitable, we could think of raising the SF to make it profitable or giving the team that represents the ilk x amount of weeks to increase their debt to make it profitable.   We need clear rules and a procedure to offboard collateral. This will help our community and partners to determine when to initiate this process.   Polygon is a strategic partner for Maker.

I\u2019ll keep this short and would love to discuss further with the MakerDAO team as the current expedited and abrupt process has caused great financial loss. How many of the total offboarded vaults were liquidated vs. self-closed? I think the numbers will show there was a lack of communication and hurt those that were attempting to help diversify the system. Sure there was no liquidation penalty, but those positions weren\u2019t given many opportunities to minimize impact. I don\u2019t disagree with the decision to offboard those collaterals given the \u201ccosts\u201d but there NEEDS to be a more orderly process once approved. ",

I don\u2019t quite see why your comments re DeFi Saver are relevant. These vaults aren\u2019t getting liquidated because the price is dropping, they\u2019re getting liquidated because the collateralization ratio is being lerped higher.
