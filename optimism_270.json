Yes, tooling Project description (please explain how your project works):   DefiLlama: Tracks protocol metrics such as TVL, volume and stablecoin usage   LlamaPay: Payment streams that distribute payments by second   Project links:   Website: defillama.com   Twitter: @DefiLlama   Discord/Discourse/Community: DefiLlama   Please include all other relevant links below: DefiLlama \u00b7 GitHub   Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): For defillama the closest competitors would be defipulse and tokenterminal For llamapay it would be superfluid Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes, it\u2019s all open source on DefiLlama \u00b7 GitHub Optimism native?: No Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:   DefiLlama added support for optimism the 14th of July 2021, days after optimism\u2019s public launch. We were one of the first data dashboards to support optimism.   LlamaPay was deployed on optimism the 29th of april 2022, on launch   Ecosystem Value Proposition: DefiLlama has been operating as a public good for the whole crypto space for over a year, maintaining metrics for >1.9k protocols and other products such as https://chainlist.org/, all while having received no investment, never charging users for anything nor having ads. Defillama has no revenue at all and offers all our products for free, covering current costs from only donations and self-funding. On top of that, DefiLlama is a completely open source project, from all our code (we open source everything: frontend, backend, adapters, bots\u2026) down to all our data, for which we offer full database exports so everyone can use it freely. This fits quite well with optimism\u2019s goal of funding public goods, as this grant would allow us at defillama to keep providing services that benefit the whole ecosystem. All these services are commonly used by optimism users and help provide transparent metrics for the defi ecosystem on it, all while acting as a directory of defi apps on optimism. We believe that this will help optimism\u2019s growth long term, as well as grow the overall blockchain ecosystem. A great example is how the Optimism foundation used our data for their Phase 0 Governance Fund distribution, which was possible thanks to:  DefiLlama providing free exports of all our data so it could be easily analyzed DefiLlama being completely open source, which allowed anyone that disagreed with out data to check exactly how it was calculated  A much more concrete explanation of the benefits to optimism is provided in the next section. Number of OP tokens requested: 300k This amount of tokens represents the sum of the request for defillama analytics (170k) and llamapay (130k). Reasoning for both is explained below. To determine grant amount i\u2019ve looked at previous grants awarded:   Rotki: 190k OP awarded to cover salaries for optimism integration into their product   Candide Wallet: 190k OP awarded also to cover salaries   Superfluid: 150k OP awarded   Now let\u2019s consider the impact defillama has had on optimism compared to rotki and candide:   The Optimism foundation relied on DeFi Llama Analytics data for their initial Phase 0 Governance Fund distribution   Users regularly check defillama to find projects on optimism and check on the state of the chain, acting a s directory where users can find out what protocols are live on optimism   Our APY dashboard tracks optimism projects and it has brought users to optimism that wouldn\u2019t have known about the yield there otherwise   Our volume dashboard is frequently quoted by optimism-native protocols such as velodrome to compare metrics against other projects   DefiLlama integrated optimism right after it launched, and have maintained metrics for optimism protocols since then, with no incentives at all   Our price API covers optimism tokens and is being used by multiple companies for their optimism integrations (eg: a tax company is using it to calculate taxes on optimism activities)   Given these, I think most people would consider that defillama had a higher impact than them, so I think it\u2019s fair to request a grant amount of 170k OP (20k lower) for defillama analytics. Something important to note is that the first two projects requested grants in order to cover costs of integrating optimism, but unlike them, defillama has already integrated optimism in all of our products since a year ago. For this reason the grant here would be given to continue our general work rather than integrating optimism (since we already did 1 year ago). I can understand that this might make funding defillama less interesting, since optimism support on our product is already live and not contingent on this grant, thus it may seem like theres no reason to award it. However, choosing to fund projects that propose integrating the chain but not funding projects that have already done so incentivizes projects not to add support unless they receive a grant, since doing so prevents them from receiving a grant, all while punishing projects that already integrated optimism before of their own accord. This type of incentive goes against what optimism is trying to achieve with this grant program, so retroactive incentives make a lot of sense to avoid this. Regarding llamapay, here\u2019s a quick comparison against superfluid:   Llamapay is completely open source, while superfluid\u2019s not (eg: neither their app frontend nor their liquidations bots are opensource)   Llamapay has no vcs, it\u2019s purely funded through donations and self-funding. Superfluid raised 10M.   Llamapay was deployed on optimism on launch, while superfluid took much longer since their launch.   Currently llamapay\u2019s TVL on optimism is ~55k while superfluid\u2019s is ~36k.   Llamapay is being used by optimism-native projects such as velodrome   For these reasons I think it could make sense to request a similar or higher OP allocation than superfluid but since we are mixing this with the defillama request we\u2019ll just lower it to 130k (20k lower). Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): We don\u2019t have a token Proposal for token distribution: The full allocation will go to cover operational costs, allowing us to continue delivering highly maintained/updated data.

In the case of DeFi Llama we can probably expect a ton of more features added as a result of this funding. It\u2019s a win for Optimism and for DeFi Llama, I\u2019m fully in support! ",

I say slippery slope because it might encourage other protocols to apply for retroactive grants when RGPF should be tackling that. I am not against the proposal and appreciate that they compared it to other grants to decide on a token amount. However, some further insight into the breakdown of the team and the expected operational costs would provide some transparency on how long the grant will last.

Instead, we are asking for money to keep improving defillama and launch new products that benefit everyone. The way I see it, the only difference against other grants is that we cannot provide something like a \u201cintegrate optimism\u201d milestone since we have already integrated Optimism into every aspect of our products, and providing milestones for new products wouldn\u2019t be optimal since we keep a very close loop on products and keep our product lifecycle extremely flexible (so we don\u2019t have a clear outline of everything we\u2019ll be building over the coming months). Because of how vague that is I thought the best way to just provide a reasoning for expenses based on previous grants (also helps since OP is quite volatile while amounts previously awarded are fixed). This is important because retroactive funding carries a very different set of expectations (you are getting paid for previous work, so you can do whatever you want with the money received), whereas here we are instead committing to work on more crypto analytics and spend all money building the product. I can understand where the confusion is coming from since in this proposal I\u2019m heavy leveraging our previous work to argue for receiving this funding, but its actually like \u201cLook at all we\u2019ve built, please fund us to build all these new cool things\u201d rather than \u201cWe\u2019ve built all this, please pay us retroactively\u201d. Regarding RPGF, for us it would be much better if we could proceed to voting, and in case the community rejects it we\u2019ll just accept it and wait for RPGF rounds. ",

I understand that this is open to interpretation but these types of proposals are better suited for the retroactive public goods funding program imo.  Thank you to the Defi Lama team and I hope to see you in another grant pipeline.    Governance Update #4   Purpose: \u201cThe purpose of the Governance Fund is to incentivize sustainable growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. This does not mean that all grants must be incentive programs. The Token House is welcome to consider any and all proposals which would drive growth or address a gap in the Optimism ecosystem, including public goods projects. However, it does mean that funding should come with an expectation of growth-related deliverables. It is not the intended purpose of the governance fund to retroactively fund public goods without an expectation of future work\u2014there is a distinct OP allocation dedicated to this, which will be distributed via the Citizens House at a later date.\u201d   ",

                    "content": " 1. Presentation  We are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee, responsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure (wallets, bridges etc.).  2- About the project  Defillama is a dashboard and analytics website that has supported Optimism data analytics since shortly after launch. Llamapay is a payment streaming project that can be used to stream salaries and other payments. It\u2019s been live in Optimism since end of April 2022.  3- About the following  The proposal was published on September 27th asking for 170k OP tokens for Defillama and for 130k OP tokens for Llamapay. As a Tooling committee, the project was recently catalogued as \u201cTooling\u201d in the Grant category, and so we\u2019ve taken on the responsibility of issuing a recommendation.  4- About the proposal valuation    Added value (good to bad): good. Defillama is a staple of analytics in the space and has been active on optimism since the start. Regarding llamapay we are not sure but the comparison to superfluid is fair.  Impact or expected usage (high to low): medium. Defillama is definitely being used a lot in optimism/mainnet so the expected usage is definitely high. Llamapay usage in optimism low~ish but according to the TVL it\u2019s sufficiently high compared to other solutions.  Current Status [Development stage/Open Source?] (early to ready): ready. Both defillama and llamapay are ready.  Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate): reasonable. Both amounts are reasonable. We would have loved to see a more detailed expenditure report since the funds are supposed to cover work already done. Also it would have been much better if the proposal had been split in 2 different proposals since it concerns 2 different projects to give the committee judge each project in its own right.  Amount requested (high to low): medium. Again without a detailed expenses report it\u2019s literally impossible to judge the amount here. The comparison to other projects that received OP tokens and paid salaries is reasonable but since there is no more details given we can\u2019t determine if the amount is high or low.   5. KPIs and impact tracking Defillama dashboard is already being used by people and projects in optimism. For Llamapay the current TVL is around $61k(https://defillama.com/protocol/llamapay), 79 active streams and 39 payers with active streams (data provided by 0xngmi via DMs). To track progress and see if the grant was succesful in helping the project it would be nice to compare current and future metrics.  6- FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Yes Both projects are already deployed and working on optimism. So this grant would not be to get something to optimism but to reward for work already done. There was suggestions in the forums to ask them to wait until RPGF is ready and apply there but we believe that since RPGF is not ready yet that should not be considered as an option now. Both projects follow the opensource ethos, have no VC backing and are fully community based and open. We need more projects like this in the field, not less. So we should do everything we can to encourage people to build this way. For those reasons the final recommendation is YES. ",

Like mentioned earlier, this is better suited for RPGF  There was suggestions in the forums to ask them to wait until RPGF is ready and apply there but we believe that since RPGF is not ready yet that should not be considered as an option now.  Committee recommendation and rational are clear but I believe projects are already deployed and can continue to do the good work until citizen house is ready. Also, assuming in next 3-4 months citizen house will be ready,  DefiLamma will have a better suited proposal for RPGF. ",

Yes, completely Optimism native?: No Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: No applicable Ecosystem Value Proposition: We\u2019ll deliver multiple reports on Optimism:  Quarterly report on state of the network, metrics and progress in the last quarter, to be delivered at the end of each quarter Governance reports, published at the end of each season, with data based analysis on governance for the next 6 seasons. Ecosystem report at the end of Q1 2023 with data-based analysis of optimism ecosystem  These reports will be made available on our website, defillama.com, under a new reports section, and distributed across all channels we have available. We are aware our distribution channels may be lacking compared to our competitors, but we aim to make up for it by open sourcing everything related to our reports, including all the code that we use to generate the data, as well as maintaining any dashboards we develop for it. We believe this is quite important since it will allow everyone to cross-check our numbers (heavily improving transparency) while also making it possible for other people to generate new reports like the ones we\u2019ve made. We are aware that by doing so we\u2019ll rug our own moat (after all, why keep paying us to make reports when you can just generate them), and we are completely fine with that. What\u2019s more, it would be best if our service would generate long-lasting tools for optimism that anyone can use instead of generating any kind of dependency upon us. We are also aware that defillama isn\u2019t known for our reports, so over the next week I\u2019m going to be working on a sample report on optimism, completely free of charge, to prove our commitment and provide a sample of our work. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? There\u2019s another grant, unrelated to this one, currently in process to get voted on. Number of OP tokens requested: 182,500 OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No Proposal for token distribution: Tokens will be spent covering the costs associated with the reports ",

That said, we feel this counter proposal is hastily put together without a deep understanding or experience in this type of work. There are several questions left unanswered and clarifications we\u2019d like to make as it pertains to our proposal:  Who will be writing these reports? Has DL produced long-form reports geared towards financial reporting or governance-specific analyses? Having spent the last year doing this for over 30 top protocols we can confidently say that this is no small task that any outsourced contributor can take on but requires sector-specific analysts whose full-time job is creating these reports. For example, we have dedicated:  Governance analysts working on Messari Governor and having done several analysis for Optimism (ex 1, 2) Protocol Services analysts that solely work on DAO quarterly reporting  Data scientists building out underlying subgraphs   What does the distribution look like? It would be helpful to see how much less DL\u2019s distribution is to gauge the value. While Messari has one of the largest crypto-native audiences we\u2019ve also gone through the incredibly extensive diligence processes from Bloomberg, S&P, Refinitiv to ensure that we\u2019re not only informing the crypto ecosystem but the broader corporate and financial world as we aim to grow crypto well beyond the small portion of global economic activity it is today. These firms are starting to expend more time and resources getting smart on the space and increasingly participating on-chain in protocols they have institutional grade research on.   We are aware our distribution channels may be lacking compared to our competitors, but we aim to make up for it by open sourcing everything related to our reports, including all the code that we use to generate the data, as well as maintaining any dashboards we develop for it.   All Messari data will be open sourced (Optimism Subgraphs and Dashboards) as well so this doesn\u2019t seem to make up for the lack of distribution.   We are aware that by doing so we\u2019ll rug our own moat (after all, why keep paying us to make reports when you can just generate them)   The value in the reports is not just the surfacing of the data but the contextualization which can not be easily replicated. In the same way companies report their financial statements but there\u2019s still a huge industry for equity research to turn that raw data into valuable insights for stakeholders to consume.  ",
