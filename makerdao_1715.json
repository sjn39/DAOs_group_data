This document is only to provide more information and help Maker community, MKR holders and delegates to understand the different counterparties and their associated risk. It was prepared by SF and reviewed by CES. It is flagged as community work as it didn\u2019t fall in SF mandate.  Coinbase  Risk Coinbase will be used to convert USDC to USD and reverse. Funds are expected to stay there only for a minimal amount of time (from a few hours to a few days). Risk is mitigated by sending only a small chunk for investment ($50M chunk). Disinvestment resolution should also follow such a process. Should Coinbase no longer be an option for conversion, we could use Bank Sygnum to convert from DAI to USD directly but at a higher cost.  Counterparty due diligence Being a public company, a lot of information can be taken from SEC filings. Fiat positions (USD) at Coinbase are represented by \u201ccash and cash equivalents maintained in segregated Company bank accounts that are held for the exclusive benefit of customers\u201d. The use of segregated accounts should be safe in the event of Coinbase bankruptcy but timing might be an issue as those funds are still subject to automatic stay. According to the Deployment Resolution #4, trustees should transfer funds from Coinbase to Bank Sygnum within 2 hours, limiting the risk. For the crypto-assets (i.e. USDC), the Trust will use a Prime Broker account. While Coinbase believes those crypto to be safe, the lack of legal precedent keeps some uncertainties. Same as for fiat, the automatic stay might significantly delay the recovery. MIP65 will not use Custody services (as Coinbase is just used for swap), so assets will not be hold in the customer name.  The company debt is also rated by S&P and Moody\u2019s and current rating is BB and Ba2. This is in the realm of non-investment grade, something expected for a startup with a cash burn. The easiest way to track is to follow the cash and cash equivalent line of the balance sheet of Coinbase (possibly corrected by non-customer related current liabilities). The long-term debt of Coinbase is quite in the future with the first item in 2026 and isn\u2019t a concern for the time being.  731\u00d7359 5.39 KB  Overall, while not perfect, Coinbase remains a very low risk for the time being.  James Asset (PTC) Limited (incl. SHRM and Hatstone)  Risk James Asset (PTC) Limited is the trustee of the James Asset Trust. It has significant control over the MakerDAO asset limited by the declaration of Trust (James Asset Trust). The main limit is that all transactions should be approved by an Administrator (Hatstone) as described below. The director of James Asset (PTC) Limited is a corporate servicer (Riverfront Capital part of SHRM).  902\u00d7162 30.8 KB  Beside management of the assets, the remaining risk is to keep James Asset (PTC) Limited solvent. This mainly means keeping enough assets there to pay for the service provider bills. MKR holders have all the incentive to keep that in order, the biggest problem would be no longer having ways to convert DAI to US Dollars and having service providers wanting to be paid in fiat. Should any of the Administrator or Director fail, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to find an alternative in BVI.  Counterparty due diligence James Asset (PTC) Limited is a simple shell company to hold a trust. The company was created and the original shareholder was SHRM Trustees (BVI) Limited. The SHRM Group of Companies (\u201cSHRM\u201d) has evolved since the early 1990s into a highly specialised provider of trust and corporate services. With well over USD 1B AuA, our offices are situated in 3 different continents and span the world\u2019s major time zones. At SHRM we operate a \u2018boutique\u2019 trust company working in conjunction with our clients to help deliver a bespoke solution to their trust and/or corporate needs. Our inter-connected offices are located in Luxembourg, British Virgin Islands (\u201cBVI\u201d), and Hong Kong, affording us the opportunity to offer a broad spectrum of products and services to comprehensively service our clients\u2019 financially diverse and often dynamic circumstances.

Investment funds: Hatstone provides legal advice on the formation, on-going obligations and restructuring of BVI hedge funds and private equity and its functionaries (investment managers, investment advisors, custodians, prime broker etc.). We also provide our clients with fund administration services.   Monetalis  Risk Monetlis is providing two kinds of services in regard to MIP65. First, it acts as \u201cproject manager\u201d on behalf of MakerDAO setting up all the infrastructure. While this role is assumed to be continued going forward (to add a new asset manager, eventual tokenization, \u2026), failure of Monetalis shouldn\u2019t impact MakerDAO assets. In case of Monetalis going dark, MakerDAO could probably appoint one of the CUs for the interim until a new reporting agent is found.  Counterparty due diligence Monetalis Services Limited is a newly formed company in the BVI. The business relationship in regard to the operation should be enough to keep the company an ongoing concern.  Bank Sygnum  Risk Bank Sygnum is a significant nexus in which funds transit. It keeps the operating funds of James Asset (PTC) Limited (which are part of the James Asset Trust). It is also the custodian of the iShares ETFs.  Counterparty due diligence Bank Sygnum is a regulated Swiss bank. While not public, the company is publishing pillar 3 regulatory information. Bank Sygnum raised $90M as announced in early 2022 (most likely explaining the increase in capital at the end of 2021). On Basel III metrics (CET1 ratio, Leverage ratio, Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio), Bank Sygnum is far more safe than most big banks. Yet, we need to take into account that there is a probable cash burn (as the variation of capital from end 2020 to end 2021 is negative if we take in account the capital raise). We also need to take into account that the loan book (40M\u20ac) is probably composed of crypto-backed loans. For the fiat deposits, up to CHF100,000 are insured by the Swiss deposit insurance. While not used at this stage, the digital asset custody is defined as the following:  The technology for Sygnum\u2019s custody is built with a multi-layered security approach, both across hardware and software, as well as processes and governance \u2013 maximising security of private keys. The key ceremony has been ISAE 3000 audited.  Bank Sygnum is the most risky part of the construct but the risk is minimized as it is a highly regulated company.  JPMorgan Chase Currently the deployment doesn\u2019t include JPMorgan Chase, this section will be extended in the future.  Risk JPMorgan will custody the asset managed by Baillie Gifford.  Counterparty due diligence JPMorgan Chase has currently $28T of assets under custody as is the fourth biggest global player (source). It is a regulated systemic bank and provides quarterly results. There is no source of expected concerns.  Baillie Gifford Currently the deployment doesn\u2019t include Baillie Gifford, this section will be extended in the future.  Risk Baillie Gifford will manage part of the allocation. The assets themselves will be custodied by JPMorgan Chase  Counterparty due diligence Baillie Gifford assets under management is north of $450B by the end of 2021 and has existed for more than a century. The credit part is smaller, with c.$4.5bn in assets. The company is owned by its 47 partners. It is clearly in the reputable companies bucket. ",
