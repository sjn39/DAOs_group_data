Paragraph Summary The Defense Fund will be used as a contingency budget to reimburse legal defense expenses in case of legal or regulatory action against specific participants of MakerDAO. Initially, coverage will be provided to the following group of persons, which will be the initial set of beneficiaries:  Recognized Delegates Core Unit Facilitators Core Unit permanent contributors Active MKR holders (i.e., MKR voting token holders that actively participate in governance)  The legal action against the beneficiary must be directly related to its activities at MakerDAO.  Motivation Self-insurance is a well-known risk management technique that consists in setting funds aside for covering a possible future cost. Technically, it is a tool for retaining and managing risks professionally. Typically self-insurance is used when risk can not be transferred through traditional insurance. Self-insurance instruments can be used as an alternative or a complement to insurance. DAOs are novel organizational structures and, as such, may expose their participants to novel legal risks. MakerDAO is not a legal subject, hence is unable to limit liability risks for its participants. Self-insurances are customizable instruments that can be tailor-made to manage novel or complex risks. Therefore, they are suitable risk management instruments for DAOs.  Special Purpose Fund Name Defense Fund  Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials This SPF will be used as a contingency budget with the purpose of covering legal defense costs in case a MakerDAO stakeholder is a target of legal action. All claims and payouts will be managed according to a process contained in the Claim Procedure Manual. This Procedure Manual is under development by the companies Gallagher and Artex. These companies are world leaders in insurance and risk management and have successfully delivered a feasibility study. This feasibility study analyzes the average legal defense costs in jurisdictions where MakerDAO participants have most exposure, describes possible legal and operational setups for the fund, determines its minimum capital requirements, and recommends coverage amounts and limits. Additionally, the feasibility study describes the claim process, which will be as follows:  A beneficiary is the target of a legal or regulatory action and requires legal representation. The beneficiary must first assume its legal expenses and then, if eligible, submit a claim to the fund for reimbursing legal costs. Claims must be accompanied by supporting documentation. Claims are first submitted to an external technical committee. This committee will be composed of insurance and risk management experts. They will verify the eligibility of the claimant, assess the claim, and evaluate supportive documentation. Based on this information, they will issue a recommendation to approve or reject a payout. The committee will have a term of 8 (eight) working days to make a decision. This recommendation will be submitted to the SPF multisig signers. According to the rules contained in MIP55c2, the funds in escrow must be in a multisig with signatory requirements of a minimum of two Comptrollers. Comptrollers will review the recommendation of the technical committee and decide whether they approve it or they reject it. If approved, funds will be released to the final recipient\u2019s designated address, which is a whitelisted address controlled by the beneficiary. If they reject it, they must provide an explanation on their reasons. From the moment that the external committee recommendations reach the Comptrollers, they have a term of 8 (eight) working days to execute the payout or provide an explanation on why they reject it. During this term, they can request additional information or opinions from the external committee.  The Claim Procedure Manual will define all necessary operational aspects, including:  User Guide Registration process Elaboration of terms of use Definition of beneficiaries Policy description, coverage amounts and exclusions Claim process, timing, and decision-making rules Requisites for submitting a claim, required supporting documentation and forms Process for updating the Claim Procedure Manual (i.e., variation of coverage amounts or inclusion of new beneficiaries to include new emerging roles in the Endgame Plan).   Funding Breakdown  Funding will be done in a lump sum upon governance approval of the SPF. Funds in this SPF are destined as a contingency budget for covering legal defense and legal representation expenses. Funds in this SPF will not cover operational costs of the project. Payout decisions and claim management will follow the ruleset contained in the Claim Procedure Manual. The Maker Protocol (MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB) will be listed as a beneficiary on the multisig wallet. This allows the protocol to withdraw funds from the multisig wallet, ensuring control over these funds.

DAO contributors face quite unknown legal exposures when compared to employees of legal corporations and if the wider DAO space is to flourish we need to offer backstops of some kind. Relative to entirely offloading this risk to an insurance company (DeFi or Traditional) I like the approach of creating a self-insurance fund as step one as it is a concrete step that demonstrates MakerDAO\u2019s commitment to supporting their contributors and also socialising that risk with the wider group of MKR holders. A key next step here would be to get the details on the policy wording to understand exactly what is intended to be covered as with these types of coverage certain exclusions can materially change the value to the holders. I understand this is a work in progress so am just noting this point as I\u2019m personally very keen to see the details. Switching hats to my view as the Founder of Nexus Mutual, there is also an opportunity to share this risk with Nexus. This could be done is various ways, but likely as an excess layer on-top of the initial fund. For example:  The insurance fund takes 100% of losses up to $xm Nexus Mutual takes 80% of losses above $xm up to $ym, witht he remaining 20% being taken by the insurance fund to maintain incentive alignment.  The most obvious structure if for Nexus Mutual to simply \u201cfollow claims\u201d and therefore just pay when the financial triggers are hit based on the Claim Procedure Manual. We are more than happy to collaborate on these points as required and would be happy to come back with a proposal after seeing the detailed cover wording. ",

Say there is some event where a government agency investigates and/or charges a DAO contributor for participating in the DAO. The legal costs incurred in this defense are very likely covered by the terms this self-insurance fund is providing. Say the defense costs then exceed the limits agreed with Nexus, then this would result in a valid claim. The claim would be handled in the usual way via Nexus Mutual\u2019s claims assessment. Nexus has paid almost $10m in claims since it\u2019s launch in May 2019 and you can read more about how claims are handled in our docs etc. I believe this is one of your points, ie can Nexus be relied on to pay valid claims. I can provide more info here, but this is a separate point to the underlying cause of the claim which can come from anywhere, on-chain or off-chain. Nexus claims assessors can use any information they need to (on-chain or off-chain) to decide in the validity of claims in line with the cover wording. Humans vote and reflect those views on chain.

This self-insurance proposal is a great step forward for decentralized projects like Maker and showcases how novel arrangements can be deployed by DAOs to approximate the functions of traditional organizations and services. I just want to mention that it is important that the contributors that require assistance from the SIF are able to do so in a swift, permissionless and trustless way. Decentralizing this process is tricky as, DeFi insurance setups are vulnerable to the reverse agency problem esp if the DAO members are the ones voting to use their own funds to protect select members of the DAO. To avoid this problem, the ideal solution for such situations is to delegate the claim decision to a fully decentralized process, i.e. to a subjective oracle to interpret the rules and procedures written by the DAO at the time of setup of the SIF. Kleros has been the leading arbitration and subjective oracle solution provider in this space, and has helped Unslashed Finance (the leading provider of UST depeg insurance during the Terra Luna downfall) to secure more than $20 million in claims in just the past 12 months. We will be following this MIP closely and will be on standby to assist if Maker would like to have a chat on how to fully decentralize the SIF payout process in a trustless, secure and credibly neutral manner.

This is a TERRIBLE take, incorrect and the wrong conclusion to draw. Community is cautioned against taking any comfort from armchair pontifications based on clickbait headlines. Please understand the details here and read the Order for yourselves: https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.400807/gov.uscourts.cand.400807.59.0.pdf Not one single thing has changed with respect to the DAO being lawfully served as initially approved. The judge has now merely stated that known token holders (the Founders) should ALSO be personally served. \"As will be detailed in that order, it seems clear in this case that Ooki DAO has actual notice of the litigation. But to provide the best practicable notice, the CFTC should serve at least one identifiable Token Holder if that is possible. I will delay entering that order until the CFTC has made that attempt, as discussed in the next paragraph. The CFTC is now ORDERED to serve Bean and Kistner, in their roles as Ooki DAO Token Holders, with the complaint and all relevant documents in this case at the earliest time practicable. If the CFTC is unable to do so, it is ordered to show cause why service is impossible. The CFTC must file confirmation of service or its response to show cause no later than January 11, 2023.\" Now, the plot twist is that the Founders attorney is saying they are no longer part of the DAO, so what will CFTC do about that? In no way does that imply the DAO\u2019s service was ineffective. Again, as quoted above from the order linked the Judge is tell us: As will be detailed in that order, it seems clear in this case that Ooki DAO has actual notice of the litigation. We must wait and see. ",

                    "content": "    LinkMarine:  Good question. The proposal does suggest that MakerDAO is itself legally transparent, and the proposal would skip over MakerDAO for the benefit of delegates, contributors, etc.   The main purpose of this instrument is to protect persons involved in MakerDAO. MakerDAO is not a company nor is incorporated as a legal entity. The main purpose of legal entities is to limit liability risks, so we need first to de risk involvement of individual stakeholders. As we all know, DAOs are novel organizational structures that are not legally recognized nor have legal personality (There are some exceptions, like the Wyoming DAO law, which has its own set of problems, but that would be topic for another forum post). More generally, I see DAOs more as a set of rules encoded by smart contracts and enforced on a blockchain.     fumoffuXx:  Even though Recognised delegates are identifiable. it will be a jurisdiction nightmare to launch a litigation suite to off US shore individuals.   The fund will provide worldwide coverage. This means, it doesn\u2019t matter where  the beneficiary is located or in which jurisdiction the legal action takes place. The main condition is that the suit is directly related to the activity of that person at Maker.     fumoffuXx:  I still think the name needs to change to a \u201cLitigation Provision\u201d. As MAKER is setting aside a pool of funds for litigation reimbursements.   I think Self Insurance describes well this instrument, but happy to reconsider naming options! If we do it, I would prefer more general terms like Legal Defense or Legal Protection Fund.     fig:  Is it possible by creating and announcing a fund of this size it invites more legal proceedings and attacks? Seems like it can get resource intensive, quick.   More than a legal bounty, the SIF is a contingency fund with a very specific purpose: reimburse legal defense costs. The payouts are not discretionary; they will be subject to detailed policy contained in the Claim Procedure Manual and the claims will be assessed by a professional, technical team. Proper legal defense can be very onerous and out of reach to individual contributors. We want to assure that persons involved in the DAO have the best possible defense, and a contingency fund is the first step in this direction. This should deter future lawsuits. ",

Planning SIF goals, outcomes, deliverables?  If I understand correctly, the MakerDAO Legal team is testing the community opinion about the $5M Self-insurance Fund (SIF).   At the moment MakerDAO didn\u2019t ask about anything else, like claim and payout management frameworks, 3rd party administrator (TPA), etc.  What are the final goals, outcomes, deliverables and nice to have features for the next 3-6 months?   Have you planned any budget for the SIF implementation? If yes, can we apply for the MakerDAO SIF framework implementation grant?   The Atomica team would like to check out how our framework can fit the Claim Procedure Manual requirements. If the Atomica framework fits most of the Claim Procedure Manual draft requirements we can significantly reduce the development time and budget and OPEX cost. Could you please share the SIF Claim Procedure Manual draft We can sign the NDA if needed.  The Part 2 section \u201cHow can we help?\u201d is coming ) ",

Any protocol or DAO may use Atomica framework for the insurance and risk markets deployment. Atomica.org framework may significantly reduce the insurance and risk market development time and OPEX cost. We would be happy to assist you in the Maker DAO Legal Expenses Insurance (LEI) risk market creation and configuration. Atomica.org framework benefits:   Neutrality. We are not trying to be an insurance company. We position ourselves as the insurance and risk market framework which connects the dots between the demand side (policy buyers) and supply side (reinsurance providers). Both parties can benefit from using the framework.  No conflict of interests. By design Atomica.org has segregated claim and payout approver roles. The MakerDAO committee may use multisig, voting tools or external tools like Kleros, Uma to control the claims and payouts process.  Whitelists. To avoid insider games, only MakerDAO and DAO members 0x addresses can be whitelisted. Only MakerDAO and DAO members will be able to buy the Maker DAO LPI or LEI insurance. Thanks to perpetual NFT policies MakerDAO can buy the LEI insurance centrally and send policies to DAO members. DAO members can manage policies on their own. It works like a mobile data plan, MakerDAO members can increase or decrease policy coverage capacity, may top-up or withdraw policy balance. SIF fund or part of the fund may be connected to the MakerDAO risk market as the external reinsurance pool. The external reinsurance pool funds are controlled by MakerDAO multisig and not affected by the smart contract hacking risk. MakerDAO SIF fund can be used as a junior tranche or first loss pool.  3rd party underwriters incentivization. If MakerDAO needs more than $5M LEI coverage capacity, the 3rd party reinsurance pools can be connected to MakerDAO LEI risk market. To accelerate and bootstrap the MakerDAO risk market, underwriters can be incentivized by the MKR or other ERC20 tokens.  The next steps to proceed forward: We already prepared the closed live demo Maker DAI LEI insurance.  Access can be allowed for google accounts provided by the MakerDAO. It would be nice if you can provide the 0x address for the Claim Processor and Payout Comptroller\u2019s. Next we can prepare the Maker DAI LEI insurance live demo - use cases documentation.  Risk market technical specification preparation:  Policy wording Whitelisted policy buyers 0x addresses Risk tower, reinsurance pools structure Premium token - DAI (The insurance premiums will be paid in DAI) 3rd party underwriters reinsurance pool token - USDC, Eth, etc? Withdraw delay for underwriters and LPs  Any feedback is welcome and appreciated. Best regards, Atomica.org integration team ",

Coverage must be denied if a claim has been made before this is implemented without full disclosure that this may be used for an already-made claim, however informally made.  Once implemented, it should require for coverage that within X days that a member gets a claim that the member caused the claimant harm, however informal and even without a demand for compensation, it should be reported to someone so it can be assessed.

For a potential claimant to know that any of the members have attorneys at their disposal to defeat a claim, that will dissuade litigation. For a potential claimant to know that there is a bucket of DAI for payment of claims, that will encourage litigation.   Totally agree. The SIF will be used to reimburse legal defense costs, not to pay out third party claims.     omahalawyer:  it does not and should not be 5 MM. 1 MM DAI, put into Yearn or elsewhere that it can be easily obtained, is sufficient, with some caveat that with a DAO vote additional DAI can be allocated to particular defense.   The 5MM sum is not arbitrary. This is the Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR) calculated by Gallagher / Artex using EIOPA Solvency II methodology, which is used in the insurance industry. I will ask them to elaborate on the methodology used in their models.     omahalawyer:  the terms must be that it is a \u201cclaims made\u201d contract, meaning that its coverage is not based upon the date of the alleged negligent act like your homeowner\u2019s policy, but when a demand by a claimant is made.   Agree 100%. Coverage is only provided when the legal action against a MakerDAO stakeholder  occurs after the SIF is implemented.     omahalawyer:  But I\u2019m concerned this is being proposed because someone already knows about a claim - that must be excluded without full disclosure to the DAO members.   No. As I said, this is not related to any case particular nor intended to cover a past or pending claim. ",

MakerDAO worked with Artex, an international risk and insurance expert company, which is part of the Gallagher Group, who through its group\u2019s companies conducted the feasibility study for MakerDAO\u00b4s SES Core Unit. The aforementioned analysis included a study of the minimum capitalization rate of the self-insurance fund. To determine the size of the fund, EIOPA\u2019s Solvency II models were used. This methodology is considered as an international  standard in the insurance industry . Solvency II sets the minimum capitalization rules for insurance companies and provides the formulas and methodology necessary to calculate the solvency amounts.  These formulas were used as a proxy for determining  the recommended capitalization amounts for the SIF. In the development of the Solvency II models for MakerDAO, different variables were used, such as the number of beneficiaries, the probability of claims, and the insured value per person.  To determine the insured values, a weighted average of legal costs in the US, UK and EU was calculated in a separate study. Please get in touch if you have further questions! ",

                    "content": "I want to be clear about something here. DAOs can\u2019t make formal contracts with anyone since there is no signer.   So the idea of having an insurance contract would have to be carried out by some valid insurer in various jurisdictions.   Participants would have to enlist/subscribe and then the bill to the provider of the \u2018insurance policy\u2019 paid by Maker. Such contract in the above case would be binding, but would likely be paid retroactively.   Now whether Maker wants to pay and retain a legal firm for representation by all approved parties that is another entirely different matter. My concerns about calling it \u2018insurance\u2019 is that this opens up all kinds of additional litigation avenues particularly when other litigation is on-going. Throwing money into a multisig is far different than paying a valid insurer and having some sort of realistic coverage since what happens if litigation costs exceed $5M, how fast will someone get funds to help with their representation. Let\u2019s be clear here even with this $5M in some multisig piggy bank - you better have funds for representation available yourself since I don\u2019t see anything about the terms here.   Example:  random easily findable (non participating) MKR holder is identified and sued by any regulatory agency for any reason under General Partnership. So do they get access to funds or no? Since MakerDAO is saying it will cover $5M does this mean in the event the first MKR holder has liability exceeding $5M could another suit be made to another MKR owner by the first for additional compensation, etc. While I am supportive of some sort of liability insurance for legal or other expenses I think this needs to be handled by a real insurance firm via signing up the counter parties and some real terms put on this insurance both to the DAO and to the insured.

                    "content": "Thank you for your comments. Self-insurance is a risk management instrument that is fundamentally different from insurance. While the latter is about risk transfer to a third party (i.e. insurance company) the former is about risk retention. Self-insurance is commonly used when risk can\u2019t be transferred through traditional insurance, which is a typical situation in crypto. Self-insurance can also be used in combination with traditional insurance. Sometimes insurers will require that the customer takes a first loss, which could be in the form of a deductible or a self-insurance instrument, to provide coverage. This SPF covers only the self-insurance component. This component can work without a legal entity. We need a claims procedure with a description of policy, exclusions, process, etc.  We also need a technical committee to process the claims, work that can be done by Gallagher /  Artex or another insurance expert. This framework is under development by Gallagher and we expect the final version by the end of January. With the Self-insurance instrument in place, we can go to the insurance markets to seek extended coverage in excess of 5MM, or include additional stakeholders or risks. For this part, we will most probably need a legal entity that signs the insurance contracts. This entity would act as a policyholder, and the beneficiaries would be MakerDAO stakeholders. Again, this is not part of this SPF but can be an interesting next development as part of a comprehensive risk management strategy. I am also open to changing the name of the proposal, as I see that is causing some confusion. Maybe Protection or Defense Fund could be good naming alternatives. ",

                    "content": "I\u2019m aware this has already passed, but I want to highlight two serious issues with this setup. The first is pretty simple. This results in $5M being custodied by a 2/3 multi-sig. This feels extremely risky to me, regardless of the character of those involved. I don\u2019t believe this level of multi-sig / personal security risk is present anywhere else in the DAO. I strongly suspect that at least 2 of the signers have been present in the same physical location at one or more previous MakerDAO meetups. I\u2019m aware that MIP55 is not the most well-written MIP, but I strongly suggest that those involved with this SPF find a compliant way to add additional signers to the multi-sig while maintaining the 2/3rd majority of signers required to access funds prior to funds being distributed. Second, and slightly more complicated, I don\u2019t believe it makes sense to hold these funds in Dai in the manner that has been proposed. Consider the following scenarios:  An individual covered by the fund is sued at a time when the Maker Protocol is not insolvent and surplus buffer funds are available. In this situation, there is no need for the funds to be held in DAI outside of governance\u2019s control. An individual covered by the fund is used at a time when the Maker Protocol is insolvent and surplus buffer funds are not available. In this situation, Dai is likely not worth $1, and the fund may not be able to cover legal defences.  If the intention is to reliably provide legal defence funds in both of these scenarios, I would suggest swapping the Dai to an alternative centralized stable (or a basket of such). If the intention is only to support scenario #1, the funds should be held in the surplus buffer or the pause-proxy contract where they are not vulnerable to risks related to multi-sigs.  Pings to ensure people see this, as it is easy to lose things on the forum. @Recognized-Delegates @tadeo @prose11 @layerzero ",

Overall I think it is crucial that active and visible key participants in the ecosystem have reassurance that the DAO has their back in case their legitimate activities gets them into legal complications. But this specific proposal is a major decision involving a lot of funds based on a hybrid legal and cryptoeconomic design that I think is confusing or unknown to most MKR holders. To protect MKR holders I will attempt to accumulate a large amount of votes on the current active governing proposal, to prevent it from losing governing proposal status, to prevent this transfer of funds from going through. Maker Governance is being bombarded with an onslaught of high impact proposals at a rate that far exceeds the bandwidth of probably most or all MKR holders. Luckily, the Pregame Constitution will once and for all shut off the ability to make arbitrary proposals like this, and I think this proposal is another good reason why there has to be more structure to how highly impactful decisions are made. My preference would be to coordinate to block the executive vote from passing, holding off with moving forward with this transfer for now, and instead take our time implement the rules and protections around this carefully using the Physical Resilience Scope Framework of the Endgame Constitution. I\u2019m not arguing that we should send a message to contributors that they will be in their own in case of a legal challenges by holding off from transferring these funds for now - in the meantime, the governance poll will hopefully serve as a commitment that Maker Governance and at least the delegates are willing to use surplus buffer funds to pay reasonable legal fees for individuals who get into legal cases in connection to legitimate work or involvement with Maker.

We want to thank again all @Recognized-Delegates  that supported our proposal. A voting majority of 72% agreed to use 5MM of the Surplus Buffer as a contingency budget to cover potential legal defense costs. Moreover, the vote shows strong support for a self-insurance fund as a valid legal risk management instrument for MakerDAO.   In spite of the majority vote, we already decided to put the proposal on hold, at least until we defined and agreed on key implementation details (e.g. trust architecture of multisigs holding funds used to absorb legal risks). We posted this message shortly before the planned executive vote:    982\u00d7388 38.6 KB    Upon further consideration, we think that the best way forward is to work first on two related fronts, before we return to the funding proposal itself:   a) The Claim Procedure Manual, describing all operational requirements and procedures, which is under development and will be shared shortly.   b) Physical Resiliency Scope Framework, which will describe general policies and requirements for managing and mitigating legal risk in the context of the Endgame Plan.     The Defense Fund is designed to be a first-loss, self-insured fund, that will serve as the building block of a long term legal risk management strategy we envision for MakerDAO. It is therefore critical to carefully analyze and discuss it in the context of the Resiliency Scope Framework, to consider necessary adjustments and make it endgame-compatible.   We look forward to the upcoming discussions! ",
