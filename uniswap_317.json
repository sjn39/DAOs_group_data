How should we make people not go to other dex platforms and use uniswap? I would appreciate it if you leave a comment below, but my advice is that active working community members within the next 1 month should be rewarded so that new members are encouraged Those who only use uniswap as dex and do not use other platforms, that is, those who show loyalty can be identified and rewarded.
