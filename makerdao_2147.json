Paragraph Summary MIP113 establishes the Arbitration Scope Framework. This covers principles and processes related to high level decision making, constitutional interpretation and regulation of constitutional conservers and regulation the core governance processes. The Arbitration Scope plays a critical rule for governance security, and its processes and rules must be defined to enforce that they are carefully followed with care and precision. The Arbitration Scope constrains and supersedes all other Scope Frameworks.  Component Summary MIP113c1: Preamble Contains the Preamble to the Arbitration Scope Framework. MIP113c2: Scope Framework Articles Contains the Scope Framework Articles for the Arbitration Scope Framework. MIP113c3: Responsible Facilitators Contains details on the role and responsibilities of the Responsible Facilitators of each Scope Framework. MIP113c4: Active Responsible Facilitator Core Unit List Modification Subproposal Process Contains the process to modify the list of active Responsible Facilitators. MIP113c5: Scope Framework Articles Modification Subproposal Process Contains details of how the Arbitration Scope Framework can be amended.  Motivation The Arbitration Scope Framework is necessary to define the Scope as per the Maker Constitution.  Specification  MI113c1: Preamble The Arbitration Scope covers principles and processes related to high level decision making, constitutional interpretation and regulation of constitutional conservers and regulation the core governance processes. The Arbitration Scope plays a critical rule for governance security, and its processes and rules must be defined to enforce that they are carefully followed with care and precision. The Arbitration Scope constrains and supersedes all other Scope Frameworks.  MIP113c2: Scope Framework Articles  1: Constitutional Interpretation  1.1: Constitutional Interpretation definition Constitutional Interpretation is used to disambiguate elements in the constitution with expanded definitions, in connection with specific decisions or disputes relying on language from the Maker Constitution. To make the Maker Constitution as solid and immutable as possible, all constitutional interpretation is recorded to set a precedent about the spirit of the constitution and how future interpretations should be made.  1.2: Principles of using Constitutional Interpretation Constitutional Interpretation should only be employed when the Maker Constitution itself does not offer enough clarity or contains faults or omissions that can be mitigated by extrapolating the spirit of the Contitution. The resolution of constitutional ambiguity or disputes must be fully congruent with the spirit of the Constitution and prior precedent, while also clearly setting new precedent and help to prevent future ambiguous situations from occuring. Depending on the level of ambiguity, an MKR vote may be needed to establish the precedent.  1.3 Constitutional Intepretation Process This section contains the processes for proposing and settling Constitutional Interpretations.   1.2.1: Constitutional interpretation precedent approved through MKR vote is contained as subelements of this clause. A majority of Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope can trigger a vote to add a new subelement if it is necessary resolve a constitutional ambiguity.     1.2.2: Constitutional Interpretation precedent made directly by the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope is contained as Active Subelements to the Active Element 1.2.2.1A.   1.2.2.1A: \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4  List of Constitutional Interpretations: * N/A \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4    2: Scope Framework appeals  2.1: Scope Framework appeals definition Scope Framework appeals are a process that allows any Maker Governance participant to trigger a review of a Scope Framework. This can be in connection with the Scope Framework failing to follow the Constitutional Boundaries, or if it contains biased or otherwise conflicted elements. It can either be a general misalignment of the language of the Scope Framework, or a specific situation where the Scope Framework is being misinterpreted or otherwise violated.  2.2: Scope Framework appeals process Scope Framework appeal proposals are submitted by CVC Members, and can be accepted or rejected by a majority of the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope. If a Scope Framework appeal is accepted, the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope must review it. Arbitration Facilitators can also directly choose to review a Scope Framework for adherence with constitutional requirements.   2.2.1: The Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope can by consensus directly edit a Scope Framework to align its content with the constitutional boundaries and other constitutional requirements such as neutrality.     2.2.2: A majority of the Responsible Facilitators can trigger an MKR governance poll to implement an edit to the appealed Scope Framework that will align it with the constitutional boundaries and other constitutional requirements such as neutrality.   3: Constitutional Conserver management  3.1: Constitutional Conserver management definition Constitutional Conservers are Ecosystem Actors that perform specific critical tasks in Maker Governance. The Arbitration Scope is tasked with monitoring their adherence to the constitutional rules that apply to them, and take action when necessary.  3.2: Constitutional Conserver recognition Constitutional Conservers must be recognized by the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope. The process of obtaining recognition is specific to each type of Constitutional Conserver. It is not possible for a Constitutional Conserver to gain recognition in more than one type of role at the same time, attempting to become recognized as a different Constitutional Conserver will mean reliquinshing the old Constitutional Conserver recognition.  3.3: Constitutional Conserver adherence requirements Constitutional Conservers must support the integrity of the Maker Constitution. This includes following specific requirements, as well as indirect requirements extraprolated from the spirit of the constitution.   3.3.1: Constitutional Conservers may not incite actions that contradict the Maker Constitution.     3.3.2: Constitutional Conservers may not incite attempts to modify or overturn the Maker Constitution outside of its self-contained processes.   3.3: Constitutional Conserver derecognition process The Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope must derecognize Constitutional Conservers that break the Constitutional Conserver adherence requirements specified in 3.3.   3.3.1: Derecognition of an Ecosystem Actor identity can be done by a Responsible Facilitator of the Arbitration Scope, by directly adding them to the Active Element 3.3.1.1A.  3.3.1.1A:  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 List of derecognized Ecosystem Actors: * N/A \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4      3.3.2: If a Constitutional Conserver breaks the adherence requirements, but the Responsible Facilitators fail to derecognize them, any MKR holder can lock 10 MKR, by sending it to the Pause Proxy, to trigger a vote of derecognition. This process is to be replaced by the Facilitator penalty mechanism.   3.3.2.1: If the derecognition vote succeeds, the Constitutional Conserver is derecognized, and the 10 MKR is returned to the MKR holder that triggered the vote.  3.3.2.2: If the derecognition vote fails, in case there were legitimate concerns about the constitutional adherence of a Constitutional Conserver, a Responsible Facilitator may bundle an executive vote payload to return the 10 MKR to the MKR holder that triggered the vote.     4: Constitutional Voter Committee management  4.1: Constitutional Voter Committee management definition Constitutional Voter Committees are organized groups of Ecosystem Actors with publicly verified MKR ownership. Their role is to represent the interests of MKR holders and form opinions on the direction of Maker Governance, primarily through the modification of the Scope Frameworks in quarterly cycles.  4.2: Constitutional Voter Committee Member recognition process To become recognized as a CVC Member, an Ecosystem Actor must post a recognition submission message on the Maker Governance Forum. Initially, a CVC Member will be unaffiliated with any CVCs, until they join an existing CVC or create a new CVC. following the template in 4.2.1. The Ethereum address provided must contain MKR. The message must be cryptographically signed by the provided Ethereum address.   4.2.1: The CVC Member recognition submission template is as follows, and must be posted to the Maker Governance Forum.   4.2.1.1: \u2018\u2019\u2019 Title: CVC Member Recognition submission CVC member recognition submission [Ethereum address] [Cryptographic signature of message] \u2018\u2019\u2019       4.2.2: The list of unaffiliated CVC Members is contained in 4.2.2.1A. The Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope must regularly monitor the Recognition Submissions messages on the Maker Governance forum and add all Ethereum Addresses of valid CVC Members.  4.2.2.1A:  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 List of unaffiliated CVC members: * N/A \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4    4.3: CVC Member specific adherence requirements CVC Members must always maintain MKR in their recognized ethereum address.  4.4: CVC Scope Framework and Governance Strategy Position Documents Every quarter, a CVC produces a Scope Framework Position Document for each of the 12 Scopes, and a Governance Strategy Position Document.   4.4.1: The Scope Framework Position Documents are based on and make edits to the current Scope Framework, or on an Advisory Council Output Document.  4.4.2: The Governance Strategy Position Document provides the general guidelines and values for how CVC Members and CDs that follow the CVCs Governance Strategy should vote in particular situations. The Governance Strategy Position Document also defines the name, short description and full description of the CVC.   4.5: CVC Subcommittee Meetings Every quarter, a CVC holds a real time Subcommittee meeting for each of the 12 Scopes. Each meeting must occur in a specific week starting with the first full week of each quarter, called the Scope Focus Week. The focus week of a Scope is based on its number out of the Scope Frameworks.   4.5.1: 1: Stability and Liquidity, 2: Decentralized Collateral, 3: Real World Asset Collateral, 4: Ecosystem, 5: Protocol Engineering, 6: Growth, 7: Physical Resilience, 8: Interface, 9: Infrastructure, 10: Finance, 11: Arbitration, 12: Governance Security.   4.6: CVC management The Arbitration Facilitators must monitor and record the state of all active CVCs.   4.6.1: CVCs must successfully hold a Subcommittee Meeting for each Scope per quarter, and ratify Scope Framework Position Documents for each Scope, as well as a Governance Strategy Position Document each Quarter, or they lose their active status.     4.6.2: Inactive CVCs must follow the requirements of 4.6.1 for a completely quarterly Governance Cycle to gain active status.     4.6.3: During the Pregame, any CVC Member can create a new CVC through a CVC creation message on the Maker Governance Forum based on the template of 4.6.3.1. New CVCs are active from when they are created.  4.6.3.1:    Title: CVC Creation Content: CVC Creation [Name of new CVC]     4.6.4: The list of all active and inactive CVCs are contained in 4.6.4.1A. The Arbitration Facilitators must keep the list current based on CVC creation, adherence with requirements, and CVC Decisions. Inactive CVCs are deleted, and removed from the list after 2 consecutive quarters of inactivity.  4.6.4.1A:  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 List of active CVCs and their members: * N/A List of inactive CVCs and their members: * N/A \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4    4.5: CVC Decisions CVC Decisions are formal actions that can be taken by CVCs.   4.5.1: CVC Decisions are proposed through a signed message to the Maker Governance Forum, from a CVC Member.     4.5.2: CVC Decisions are voted on during a one week period. CVC Members vote by posting a signed message refering the proposal and containing either \u201cFor\u201d or \u201cAgainst\u201d. Voting weight is based on the verified MKR of the CVC Member.     4.5.3: The available CVC Decisions are detailed in the subelements of this clause.   4.5.3.1: Adding a CVC Member. A simple majority of existing CVC Members can onboard a new CVC Member.  4.5.3.2: Removing CVC Member. A simple majority of existing CVC Members can remove a CVC Member.  4.5.3.3: Communication infrastructure moderation rights management. A simple majority of CVC Members can add or remove one or more moderators for one or more platforms.  4.5.3.4: Scheduling Subcommittee Meeting. A simple majority of CVC Members can schedule the time of a Subcommittee Meeting.  4.5.3.5: Ratifying Position Paper. A simple majority of CVC Members can ratify a Position Paper that has been publicly posted to the Maker Governance Forum.  4.5.3.6: CD rejection. A simple majority of CVC Members can reject a CD.  4.5.5.7: CVC Split. 25% of the CVC Member Voting power can initiate a CVC Split. A second vote then occurs where all CVC Members can choose to join the split. If the split gains more than 50% of all voting power, it will take over the name and CD followers.     4.6: CVC Member participation rewards The 14 CVC Members that have the highest amounts of verified MKR, meet minimum participation requirements and have not opted out, are eligible to receive CVC Member participation rewards.   4.6.1: A total of 500 MKR per year is available per year, distributed equally across 14 slots for each Scope per quarter. This gives a reward of 0.725 MKR available per qualifying CVC Member, per scope, per quarter.  4.6.2: The minimum participation requirement for a Scope each quarter, is to participate in a scheduled quarterly Subcommittee Call for the specific Scope, and to have co-authorship of the Scope Framework Position Document for of the specific Scope.  4.6.3: The Arbitration Facilitators must monitor the participation of CVC Members and bundle the MKR payments of the CVC Members that qualify into Executive Votes each quarter.   5: Constitutional Delegates  5.1: Constitutional Delegates definition Constitutional Delegate is a Constitutional Conserver role that operates Protocol Delegation System smart contracts and implements the Governance Strategies defined by the CVCs.  5.2: Recognition of Constitutional Delegates To become recognized as a Constitutional Delegate, an Ecosystem Actor must post a CD Recognition Submission message on the Maker Governance Forum. During the early stage of the Pregame, CDs must deploy exactly 2 Protocol Delegation System smart contracts, and specify which CVC Governance Strategy each of them follow. The message must be cryptographically signed by the provided Ethereum address.   5.2.1: The CD Recognition Submission template is as follows, and must be posted to the Maker Governance Forum.  5.2.1.1:    Title: CD Recognition Submission CD Recognition Submission [Ecosystem Actor Ethereum address] [Ethereum address of Delegation Contract 1]:[Followed CVC 1] [Ethereum address of Delegation Contract 2]:[Followed CVC 2] [Cryptographic signature of message]    5.3: Constitutional Delegate overview The current state of CDs is maintained by the Arbitration Facilitators.   5.3.1: The list of all current recognized CDs is maintained in 5.3.1.1A. It is updated in real time by the Arbitration Facilitators as they process and accept CD Recognition Submissions.  5.3.1.1A:  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 List of current CDs:     ETH Address Delegation Contract 1 Followed CVC 1 Delegation Contract 2 Followed CVC 2 Cryptographic Message     N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A     \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4    5.4: Constitutional Delegate specific adherence requirements In addition to the standard adherence requirements of all Constitutional Conservers, CDs are subject to strict specific adherence requirements because of the significant power entrusted to them through the incentivized voting scheme of Endgame.   5.4.1: CDs may not incite political factionalism or initiate political or strategic movements.     5.4.2: CDs must support the CVCs as much as possible, to make CVC Member participation as easy as possible by focusing on providing access to facts and data, and advice CVC Members on useful decisions that are aligned with the spirit of the CVC.     5.4.3: CDs may not represent Maker externally, or engage directly with counterparties or ecosystem participants, other than the CVCs.     5.4.4: CDs must respect their role as guardians of the security of the Maker Protocol and act accordingly, by not taking actions that could be perceived to put the security of Maker Governance into jeopardy through politicization of the CD role.     5.4.5: CDs may not stand by idly as other CDs push the limits of the slippery slope of misalignment by potentially breaking the adherence requirements.     5.4.6: CDs may not be found to collaborate to influence Maker Governance in groups or structures outside of the CVCs.   5.5: Constitutional Delegates actions CDs have formal actions that they take through cryptographically signed messages to the Maker Governance Forum.   5.5.1: CDs can choose to follow the Governance Strategy of a different CVC by posting a message that specifies a new delegate contract and a new CVC to follow. The Arbitration Facilitators must then ensure that the new Governce Strategy is displayed in the delegation frontend.   5.6: Constitutional Delegate participation requirements To maintain CD recognition a CD must have a minimum level of activity, or lose its recognition as CD and removal from 5.3.1.1A, without being Derecognized as a Constitutional Conserver.   5.6.1: A CD must keep a minimum voting activity of 75% participation in all votes on average  5.6.2: A CD must keep a minimum communication activity of having provided comments for 75% of all votes on average.   5.7: Constitutional Delegate income management The top 14 CDs that have the highest amount of combined MKR delegated to their delegate contracts, and meet minimum requirements, are eligible to receive CD income.   5.7.1: There are two levels of CD income: Prime Constitutional Delegates (PCDs) and Reserve Constitutional Delegates (RCDs).   5.7.1.1: The top 7 qualifying CDs by number of combined MKR delegated to their delegate contracts are the PCDs.  5.7.1.2: The top 8.14 qualifying CDs by number of combined MKR delegated to their delegate contracts are the RCDs.    5.7.2: When eligible for CD income, the PCDs and RCDs still have to meet specific participation requirements in CVCs.   5.7.2.1: PCDs must participate in at least 16 CVC Subcommittee Meetings per month.  5.7.2.2: RCDs must participate in at least 4 CVC Subcommittee Meetings per month.       5.7.3: Actual CD income payouts are also modified by voting activity metrics for the last 12 months, which includes overall voting activity in all of the votes that the CDs are able to vote on. If a CD is active in less than 95% of all votes, they receive a reduced amount of CD income. The reduction in income is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 CD income at 75% voting activity. If a CD falls below 75% voting activity, it loses qualification for CD income and any CD income rank they may be eligible for is passed on to the next highest CD by amount of delegated MKR.     5.7.4: Actual CD income payouts are modified by CD communication metrics for the last 12 months, which requires the CDs to write an explanation for each vote that ties it to the Governance Strategy and their independent strategy, to help the MKR holders that delegated to them to understand the logic they use when executing the chosen Governance Strategies. If the CD actively communicates on less than 95% of all votes, they receive a reduced amount of CD income. The reduction in income is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 CD income at 75% communication activity. If a CD falls below 75% communication activity, it loses qualification for CD income and any CD income rank they may be eligible for is passed on to the next highest CD by amount of delegated MKR.     5.7.5: The 7 PCD slots share a total of 2000 MKR per year amongst them, equivalent to 285.7 MKR per year for each PCD, or 23.8 MKR per month for each PCD.     5.7.6: The 7 RCD slots share a total of 500 MKR per year amongst them, equivalent to 71.4 MKR per year for each RCD, or 5.95 MKR per month for each RCD.     5.7.7: Payout of CD income is done monthly by the Arbitration Facilitators bundling MKR payments into an Executive Vote.   6: Core Units and Facilitators  6.1: Core Units and Facilitator Management During the pregame the arbitration scope manages and provides the budget for Core Units and Facilitators, while designating their responsible scopes. The role of Responsible Facilitators is further defined in MIP113c3.   6.1.1: The Ecosystem Actor name, Ethereum address and budgets are contained in 6.1.1.1A. The Active Element is changed through the ordinary CVC process.  6.1.1.1A:  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 List of Facilitator budgets:     Facilitator ETH Address DAI per Month MKR per Month One Time Lump Sum (if applicable, only applies to March/April 2023)     GovAlpha 0x01D26f8c5cC009868A4BF66E268c17B057fF7A73 75,000 28.33 226.64 MKR   TECH 0x2dC0420A736D1F40893B9481D8968E4D7424bC0B 115,000 36 N/A   Steakhouse Financial 0xf737C76D2B358619f7ef696cf3F94548fEcec379 185,000 57.5 N/A     \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4      6.1.2: The Scopes and their responsible Facilitators, or Responsible Facilitator Core Units, are contained in 6.1.2.1A.

MIP113c3: Responsible Facilitators The Responsible Facilitators of each Scope Framework are responsible for adhering to the contents of the relevant Scope Framework elements. The Responsible Facilitators also have the governance privilege to interpret, trigger or use any of the processes described in the Scope Framework elements. During the Pregame, the Responsible Facilitators are defined as the Core Unit Facilitators of the Core Units that are listed as Responsible Facilitator Core Units. The Responsible Facilitator Core Units for each Scope are defined in MIP113c2.6.1.2.1A.  MIP113c4: Active Responsible Facilitator Core Unit List Modification Subproposal Process This component is a subproposal process component that, if approved by Maker Governance, modifies the state of MIP113c2.6.1.2.1A to update the list of Responsible Facilitators. Subproposals must use the Active Responsible Facilitator Core Unit List Modification Template. This component can be used to add, amend, or remove Responsible Facilitator Core Units from any of the approved Scope Frameworks. MIP113c4 subproposals have the following parameters:   Default Feedback Period: 1 month  Frozen Period: 1 week  Governance Cycle: Monthly  Other Requirements: None.   MIP113c5: Scope Framework Articles modification Sub Proposal process During the Pregame the Scope Framework articles can be modified through the Monthly Governance Cycle using a MIP102c2 subproposal.

So it is crucial that the delegates actually do the kind of work that is most valuable, which is to support CVCs in going from their more ideological perspective to a more practical and realpolitik scope framework proposal. I think it could also work by making it possible to participate through text rather than real time. So it could be something like a CD can simply prepare a well made document in advance of the subcommittee that the subcommittee then reads before the meeting as context for the meeting. If the subcommittee doesnt like the content and it seems rushed etc, then they can warn the delegate, or directly reject the delegate. In that case the delegate will not receive any work credits for the subcommittee meeting, and will not be able to participate in any future meetings. The risk of that happening should ensure that delegates will put in a lot of effort to be helpful to the needs of the CVC, and they will be conscious if the CVCs think they are phoning it in and never showing up, without a good reason. To be inclusive of asia hours the best solution will be to have actual CVCs that hold their subcommittee meetings at those hours.

I think in an ideal world, constitutional interpretations that set clarifying precedent should lead to a modification of the constitution to include that precedent. This helps prevent the formation of a large body of precedents that governance needs to be aware of, in addition to the content of the constitution. It also prevents future misinterpretation of the constitution of individuals or entities that are unaware of the set precedent.     rune:  Depending on the level of ambiguity, an MKR vote may be needed to establish the precedent.   Who determines whether this is required? If it is the Arbitration Facilitators, this should be clearly stated. Otherwise, it should probably include a sub-point that explains the process for triggering an MKR vote on a given interpretation.     rune:  1.3 Constitutional Intepretation Process   Maybe this addresses the above points some? I still think its preferable to have the clarification lead to an inline edit, as this has a greater chance of preventing future misinterpretation. It makes sense to also record a history of the constitutional edits that take place through this process.     rune:  Scope Framework appeal proposals are submitted by CVC Members   This would appear to contradict the \u2018that allows any Maker Governance participant to trigger\u2019 clause in the previous section. Assuming you\u2019re including any MKR holder / voter / delegator in the \u2018Governance participant\u2019 definition.     rune:  and can be accepted or rejected by a majority of the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope. If a Scope Framework appeal is accepted, the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope must review it.   This is confusing. It implies the Responsible Facilitators would accept / reject an appeal without reviewing it. I suppose it covers an edge case in which a majority-but-not-totality of Responsible facilitators have accepted an appeal without the totality reviewing it? Seems moderately unlikely to come up in practice.     rune:  \u2026Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope must review it. Arbitration Facilitators\u2026   I\u2019m currently working under the assumption that these entities are the same. If they are the same, the scope framework should use the same terminology to refer to them. If not, then pick more distinct names,     rune:  The Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope can by consensus directly edit a Scope Framework to align its content with the constitutional boundaries and other constitutional requirements such as neutrality.   What\u2019s the fallback here if the Arbitration Facilitators are acting in bad faith? Can they be removed via MKR vote?     rune:  Constitutional Conservers are Ecosystem Actors that perform specific critical tasks in Maker Governance.   Should refer to the section of the constitution that defines Consitutional Conservers. (My previously communicated concerns about referencing other scopes don\u2019t apply to scopes referencing the consitution, because it should change much less frequently, and the relationship should be strictly one-way.)     rune:    3.3.2: Constitutional Conservers may not incite attempts to modify or overturn the Maker Constitution outside of its self-contained processes.    This feels overly broad. Does seeking feedback on a constitutional modification prior to officially posting it as proposal for modification count as inciting attempts to modify or overturn? Arguably it does under that statement, as the self-contained process is yet to be triggered. What if a delegate seeks feedback on a constitutional modification and the feedback causes them to reconsider and never submit it officially, does that count? If yes, you hit false positives, if no, you allow the out of \u2018well I will use the self-contained processes, I\u2019m just not at that point yet\u2019     rune:  3.3.2: If a Constitutional Conserver breaks the adherence requirements, but the Responsible Facilitators fail to derecognize them, any MKR holder can lock 10 MKR, by sending it to the Pause Proxy, to trigger a vote of derecognition. This process is to be replaced by the Facilitator penalty mechanism.   3.3.2.1: If the derecognition vote succeeds, the Constitutional Conserver is derecognized, and the 10 MKR is returned to the MKR holder that triggered the vote.  3.3.2.2: If the derecognition vote fails, in case there were legitimate concerns about the constitutional adherence of a Constitutional Conserver, a Responsible Facilitator may bundle an executive vote payload to return the 10 MKR to the MKR holder that triggered the vote.    A successful MKR vote on this would signal that governance has no confidence in the Arbitration Facilitators ability to perform their role, and should include replacing them. Like, if you employ someone to enforce the constitution, then countermand them when they make a decision related to that enforcement, it\u2019s pointless to employ them in that role. If its a temporary process, and is being replaced in the future, maybe that\u2019s fine for now.     rune:  Initially, a CVC Member will be unaffiliated with any CVCs, until they join an existing CVC or create a new CVC.   It seems extremely confusing to refer to them as a CVC member when they are not yet part of a CVC.     rune:  The Ethereum address provided must contain MKR. The message must be cryptographically signed by the provided Ethereum address.   When must it contain MKR? At the point the message is signed? At the point it is checked? In perpetuity from that point forward? How much MKR? If you do not set a threshold, this requirement becomes pointless and should be removed.     rune:  list of unaffiliated CVC Members   Again, begging you to not refer to these as CVC members (even unaffiliated) if they are not part of a CVC. CVC applicants? CVC aspirants?     rune:  CVC Members must always maintain MKR in their recognized ethereum address.   Answers one of my questions above, but again, feels like you need a threshold, or this is a pointless requirement that is met by obtaining 0.0000001MKR for a fraction of a cent. On another note, MKR lives in the governance contract, does IOU also count as MKR for this requirement? If so, it\u2019s maybe important to state that explicitly.     rune:  4: Constitutional Voter Committee management   On this section generally, I think you\u2019d benefit from splitting it into separate sections: Section 1: Constitutional Voter Committee Responsibilities Section 2: Constitutional Voter Committee Management The first should cover what CVC\u2019s actually do, the second should cover the responsibilities of the Arbitration scope facilitators in managing the CVCs. The way you\u2019ve ordered it thus far, it chops between the two, which makes it harder to interpret.     rune:  Scheduling Subcommittee Meeting. A simple majority of CVC Members can schedule the time of a Subcommittee Meeting.   You\u2019re requiring a week long vote to schedule a meeting? Like, this and many of the other CVC decisions here are really inefficient. The default assumption should be that the CVC is aligned, taking this assumption, votes only need to be triggered if a second member publicly disagrees. Like, just accept that a signed message from any CVC member is binding to decide any of the above unless contradicted by another member within some time limit. If it is contradicted, then every CVC member votes.     rune:  The 14 CVC Members that have the highest amounts of verified MKR, meet minimum participation requirements and have not opted out, are eligible to receive CVC Member participation rewards.   Why is this dependent on amount of MKR owned? Work is work, it deserves compensation regardless of how much capital you have. Just split it between all contributors? I\u2019d also say the use of 14 here is confusing, as it\u2019s actually 14 * num_scopes each quarter.     rune:  co-authorship   Would recommend sticking to a list of N authors, and a list of N contributors for each of these documents. Having two tiers of credit is the more flexible option, imo. Often in practice you have documents being authored by a couple of people, then lots of others providing minor contributions.     rune:  CDs may not incite political factionalism or initiate political or strategic movements.   This is an unenforceable requirement. It\u2019s also just kind of silly? A CVC strategy is a political / strategic movement.     rune:  and advice CVC Members on useful decisions that are aligned with the spirit of the CVC.   Like, this is further supporting my previous point. You want CD\u2019s to not incite factionalism, or initiate political or strategic movements, but they do need to advise CVC members on useful decisions that are aligned with the spirit of the CVC (a political entity.)     rune:  by not taking actions that could be perceived to put the security of Maker Governance into jeopardy through politicization of the CD role.   The role holds political power through successful campaigning with MKR holders. It will become a politicized role.     rune:  CDs may not stand by idly as other CDs push the limits of the slippery slope of misalignment by potentially breaking the adherence requirements.   Too vague, also a bad way of trying to solve the problem. If you want to make this not happen, you need to avoid the diffusion of responsibility. Make each CD responsible for reporting / revealing when a single other CD is pushing the limits of the requirements, and rotate the responsibilities once a quarter. But also doing this creates a poor working environment for all involved. So maybe just don\u2019t try to make CD\u2019s responsible for other CD\u2019s misbehaviour at all.     rune:  CDs may not be found to collaborate to influence Maker Governance in groups or structures outside of the CVCs.   So they can do this all they want as long as no one ever finds out? ",

                    "content": "Rather than give a large amount of granular feedback (I broadly agree with LFW\u2019s comments above) I put my lawyer\u2019s hat on and got to thinking about systemic ways to address some of the potential gaps in the scope framework. While I can understand if others feel there are already too many new entities/new roles in the new governance system, I think the current framework thrusts too much on the shoulders of the Arbitration Facilitators (ie, GovAlpha). While the \u2018Constitutional Court\u2019 I proposed in the Constitution thread might not gain traction, we do need to think through the puzzle of \u201cwho decides\u201d on some of the issues described in the framework - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ideal to throw the most constitutionally complex and ambiguous questions to MKR voters. Just to work through an example of what I mean:     rune:  The resolution of constitutional ambiguity or disputes must be fully congruent with the spirit of the Constitution and prior precedent, while also clearly setting new precedent and help to prevent future ambiguous situations from occuring. Depending on the level of ambiguity, an MKR vote may be needed to establish the precedent.   I agree with the intent here, but it\u2019s easy to envisage a situation where CVCs and CDs take very different views on how exactly the spirit of the Constitution and prior precedent might apply to the ambiguity at hand. I wonder if it\u2019s stretching the role of Arbitration Facilitators too much to expect them to essentially weigh in on these highly loaded disputes, while also needing to observe careful neutrality in the other respects of their role. While MKR voters could always get the final say in a vote, even that raises practical issues in terms of how the proposal is phrased, what context is included, etc. I\u2019m also conscious that part of the idea here is that MKR voters shouldn\u2019t need to get involved in intraDAO politics. One idea for a solution: having defined roles within the Arbitration Facilitators. There could be \u2018Constitutional Experts\u2019 who help weigh in on constitutional interpretation and disputes, and separate \u2018Procedural Stewards\u2019 that focus on ensuring the fair and objective management of CVCs, CDs etc. That kind of subdivision means that just one or two GovAlpha members don\u2019t carry the entire burden of constitutional observance going forward, and that in the event of a serious schism the Arbitration Facilitators won\u2019t be all viewed as being on one \u2018side\u2019 or the other. In any case, two final thoughts: we need to make sure we adequately resource GovAlpha given the scope of their role here, particularly early on in the Endgame. I think having highly competent Arbitration Facilitators is key to iron out the inevitable kinks in the game theory until the new governance systems get worked out (luckily we have great personnel already - but I\u2019m also thinking of the future need to continue that high standard). The flip side is the concern that Arbitration Facilitators are too powerful: however, that\u2019s exactly where it makes sense to have some kind of recall vote function where a majority of MKR voters can remove a corrupt or incompetent facilitator from office. I\u2019ll try to keep thinking of structural improvements that could help ease the implementation and ongoing execution of this scope framework. ",

                    "content": "Reading through new version. Will make comments as I see them.     rune:  1.3 Constitutional Intepretation Process   I would still prefer to see interpretations making changes to the inline text that caused the ambiguity. It does appear more clear when an MKR vote is triggered now though, which is good. Perhaps any precedent leading to an MKR vote could lead to inline changes to the constitution? (And those changes would be part of that vote?) That might provide an incentive for the responsible facilitators to push it to an MKR vote in the first place, if an \u2018MKR vote on a precedent\u2019 in practice is also a \u2018MKR vote to modify constitution.\u2019 If this is the case, it should share the same requirements as a full constitutional amendment, in terms of supermajority, or whatever additional requirements are present there.      rune:  Scope Framework appeals are a process that allows any Maker Governance participant to trigger a review of a Scope Framework.   Again, I would recommend changing \u2018any Maker Governance participant\u2019 to \u2018any CVC member\u2019 if this is how it actually works as implied in 2.2.     rune:  Scope Framework appeal proposals are submitted by CVC Members, and can be accepted or rejected by a majority of the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope. If a Scope Framework appeal is accepted, the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope must review it.   I would change the wording here to make your intent more clear. Suggest:  Scope Framework appeal proposals are submitted by CVC Members, and can be accepted or rejected by a majority of the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope. If a Scope Framework appeal is accepted, every Responsible Facilitator of the Arbitration Scope must review it.  This is assuming that the intention is that Responsible Faciliatators are free to reject appeal proposals without reviewing them, which seems like a weird loophole, but sure. It\u2019s possible the word \u2018review\u2019 here is pulling more weight than it first seems. Are you saying the process is as below?  Appeal is triggered by CVC member. Arbitration Facilitators look at / judge / review the appeal and decide whether it is valid. If accepted, all Arbitration Facilitators must integrate / edit / review the required scopes to resolve the appeal. (potentially also having an MKR vote.)  Honestly, I might just rewrite the whole of article #2 if you can confirm the intention. Its getting there, but its still unclear in a number of points, which is potentially risky, given the appeals process sounds pretty important.      rune:  3.1: Constitutional Conserver management definition Constitutional Conservers are Ecosystem Actors that perform specific critical tasks in Maker Governance. The Arbitration Scope is tasked with monitoring their adherence to the constitutional rules that apply to them, and take action when necessary.   The second sentence here is not a definition, and should not exist within a section titled \u2018definition\u2019.      rune:  3.2: Constitutional Conserver recognition Constitutional Conservers must be recognized by the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope. The process of obtaining recognition is specific to each type of Constitutional Conserver. It is not possible for a Constitutional Conserver to gain recognition in more than one type of role at the same time, attempting to become recognized as a different Constitutional Conserver will mean reliquinshing the old Constitutional Conserver recognition.   I believe you can shorten this without sacrificing meaning. See below:  Constitutional Conservers must be recognized by the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope. The process of obtaining recognition is distinct to each type of Constitutional Conserver. A Constitutional Conserver may not hold recognized status in more than one constitutional conserver role at a time.       rune:  as well as indirect requirements extraprolated from the spirit of the constitution.   This is extremely difficult to enforce / is open to abuse by corrupted Arbitration Facilitators. Would suggest removing or rewording.     rune:    3.3.1: Constitutional Conservers may not incite actions that contradict the Maker Constitution.    Imo, this is still unclear. What does it mean to contradict the constitution? What counts as incitement?  You have two 3.3 titles:     rune:  3.3: Constitutional Conserver adherence requirements       rune:  3.3: Constitutional Conserver derecognition process        rune:  3.3.1: Derecognition of an Ecosystem Actor identity can be done by a Responsible Facilitator of the Arbitration Scope, by directly adding them to the Active Element 3.3.1.1A.   Feels like this should be a consensus of Responsible Facilitators. Its a big move.      rune:  3.3.2.2: If the derecognition vote fails, in case there were legitimate concerns about the constitutional adherence of a Constitutional Conserver, a Responsible Facilitator may bundle an executive vote payload to return the 10 MKR to the MKR holder that triggered the vote.   Don\u2019t specify conditionals here, it increases ambiguity. It should just read \u2018If the vote fails, the MKR is returned\u2026\u2019.      rune:  To become recognized as a CVC Member, an Ecosystem Actor must post a recognition submission message on the Maker Governance Forum. Initially, a CVC Member will be unaffiliated with any CVCs, until they join an existing CVC or create a new CVC.   Just for the sake of clarity, can we make the submission message include the initial membership affiliation? So when the message is submitted it says either: \u2018We are creating a new CVC\u2019 or \u2018We have been voted in to join CVC X\u2019. This would mean Ecosystem Actors are only identified as CVC Members if they are actually a member of a CVC.      rune:  The Ethereum address provided must contain MKR.   Again, I strongly suggest either: a) Defining a threshold or b) Removing this requirement In terms of incentive alignment having 0.00001MKR is functionally identical to having 0 MKR.      rune:  The list of unaffiliated CVC Members is contained in 4.2.2.1A.   Really would suggest just not having \u2018unaffiliated CVC members\u2019 as a thing. It\u2019s extremely confusing.      rune:  4.3: CVC Member specific adherence requirements   See comment above about thresholds.      rune:  Every quarter, a CVC produces a Scope Framework Position Document for each of the 12 Scopes, and a Governance Strategy Position Document.   Should read:  Every quarter, each CVC produces a Scope Framework Position Document for each of the 12 Scopes, and a single Governance Strategy Position Document.       rune:  4.4.1: The Scope Framework Position Documents are based on and make edits to the current Scope Framework, or on an Advisory Council Output Document.   I\u2019m not sure this is a clear enough definition of what a position document is, especially since recognition is dependent on the creation of those documents.     rune:  4.4.2: The Governance Strategy Position Document provides the general guidelines and values for how CVC Members and CDs that follow the CVCs Governance Strategy should vote in particular situations.   I am not sure this is clearly enough defined either. Like, which situations? How many? Lack of specificity here will lead to the same situation now with the Recognized Delegate Requirements. How are the Arbitration Facilitators meant to judge whether a given strategy position document is written in sufficient detail?      rune:  4.5: CVC Subcommittee Meetings Every quarter, a CVC holds a real time Subcommittee meeting for each of the 12 Scopes. Each meeting must occur in a specific week starting with the first full week of each quarter, called the Scope Focus Week. The focus week of a Scope is based on its number out of the Scope Frameworks.   4.5.1: 1: Stability and Liquidity, 2: Decentralized Collateral, 3: Real World Asset Collateral, 4: Ecosystem, 5: Protocol Engineering, 6: Growth, 7: Physical Resilience, 8: Interface, 9: Infrastructure, 10: Finance, 11: Arbitration, 12: Governance Security.    Pretty sure I get it. Also pretty sure you can make this more clear.  Each quarter, each CVC holds a total of twelve real-time Subcommittee meetings, one for each of the twelve scopes. The first twelve weeks in each quarter are each the \u2018Scope Focus Week\u2019 for a different scope, based on its Scope Framework ID.  Not super happy with that wording either. It can be improved though.      rune:  4.6.1: CVCs must successfully hold a Subcommittee Meeting for each Scope per quarter, and ratify Scope Framework Position Documents for each Scope, as well as a Governance Strategy Position Document each Quarter, or they lose their active status.   Suggest:  4.6.1: Each CVC must meet the following requirements, or lose its active status. * Organize and attend a Subcommittee Meeting for each Scope during its Scope Focus Weeks. * Write and ratify a Scope Framework Position Document for each Scope by the commencement/conclusion of its Scope Focus week. * Write and ratify a single Governance Strategy Position Document each Quarter.       rune:  Inactive CVCs are deleted, and removed from the list after 2 consecutive quarters of inactivity.   Ambiguous. Suggest:     rune:  Inactive CVCs are marked as inactive after a single quarter of inactivity, and removed from the list after 2 consecutive quarters of inactivity.        rune:  4.5.2: CVC Decisions are voted on during a one week period. CVC Members vote by posting a signed message refering the proposal and containing either \u201cFor\u201d or \u201cAgainst\u201d. Voting weight is based on the verified MKR of the CVC Member.   I mentioned this before, but I think requiring public votes for what will be routine operations 95% of the time is a mistake and will both waste everyone\u2019s time, and drive them slowly insane. I would also suggest explicitly stating that the verified MKR of the CVC Member does not refer to their delegated MKR. I assumed otherwise the first time through, and I suspect others might as well. So it\u2019s worth explicitly calling them out as different values here. As a sidenote, this might make a weird dynamic in which a minority position of the CVC holds a majority of the CVCs on-chain voting power. I guess the outcome here is just that there\u2019s a split, but it could lead to some odd outcomes.      rune:  The 14 CVC Members that have the highest amounts of verified MKR, meet minimum participation requirements and have not opted out, are eligible to receive CVC Member participation rewards.   Suggestion for clarity:     rune:  The 14 CVC Members across all CVCs that have the highest amounts of verified MKR, meet minimum participation requirements and have not opted out, are eligible to receive CVC Member participation rewards.        rune:  5.4.1: CDs may not incite political factionalism or initiate political or strategic movements.   But they can take part in these movements if they already exist?  [quote=\u201crune, post:1, topic:19700\u201d]   5.4.5: CDs may not stand by idly as other CDs push the limits of the slippery slope of misalignment by potentially breaking the adherence requirements.  I still think this will fail to achieve your goal, as it distributes responsibility across all CDs to the point where none will take action.  ",
