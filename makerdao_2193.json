                    "content": " Endgame Documentation Now Live GovAlpha is pleased to present endgame.makerdao.com, a documentation site intended to cover the contents and details of the endgame plan as it develops. The site is live now. Please be aware that the content and site are currently in an unfinished state - meaning that not all endgame topics are currently covered. We\u2019ve elected to \u2018launch\u2019 the site early because we believe clear and concise documentation can aid understanding and effective debate of the endgame plan amongst delegates and contributors, even if the information is not yet comprehensive. We\u2019ll continue to work on the content in the coming months. Contributions from others outside of GovAlpha are welcome, but should probably be discussed prior to avoid duplication of effort. Please get in touch with @LongForWisdom if you want to contribute. The relevant github repository can be found here. The endgame plan has not yet been completed and finalised. This means that we cannot guarantee the accuracy of any individual page at any given time. We plan to achieve the following baseline set of goals:  Meaningful updates to the content on a monthly basis. This will involve filling in missing pages, or updating pages that are no longer accurate. Maintaining parity (subject to the monthly update cadence) with written communications about the endgame plan originating from Rune. Actively attempting to clarify unclear statements where they exist in written communications.  Further, we may attempt to do the following when we deem it worthwhile to do so:  Maintain parity (subject to the monthly update cadence) with recorded spoken communications about the endgame plan originating from  Rune. Updating a subset of pages on a weekly cadence. Specifically, the glossary page and the resources page. Produce non-textual explanation tools like diagrams or video content.  The first update is likely to take place at the end of March.  Things you can do to help If you\u2019re interested in supporting this effort, but don\u2019t wish to contribute directly, there are a few things you can do to help us make this documentation as effective as possible.  If you see something you know is incorrect, especially if it\u2019s been there for more than a month, please message us on Discord. If there is some area of Endgame that you have trouble with, and this documentation hasn\u2019t helped, please message us on Discord. Please use the feedback emoji in the bottom right of each page. No login / credentials are required to use these. Encourage Rune to document changes to the Endgame Plan publicly in written form. This makes it much easier to ensure content is correct and up-to-date.  ",
