Problem: Right now, there is no formal governance process that quantitatively seeks community input on major protocol changes. Currently, core devs make decisions on significant protocol changes. While they do seek out community input, this community input comes in the form of GitHub comments, Twitter, surveys, and medium posts. The current mechanism to gauge community input is incredibly amorphous and non-standardized. Furthermore, many ETH holders/Ethereum community members do not even know this process currently exists. Even more concerning, this process does not involve quantitatively gauging the sentiment of the community. For example, in the ProgPOW debate there was no \u201cvote\u201d taken for the community and respective stakeholders (miners, dapp developers, etc.) to truly voice in their opinions in way that is comprehensive. While a petition was made, a petition is not necessarily the best medium for gauging the sentiment of an entire community. A formal debate and voting process, where people could transparently see and vote on all the arguments that are being made in writing, would have been more productive. Solution: What if there was a new application that became the main medium for community members to voice their opinions on major protocol changes? A place for people and entities building on top of Ethereum to debate ideas and even vote on those ideas so core devs have a more accurate quantitative understanding on what the community desires; an application that is developed solely to serve this need. A sort of legislative branch to the core devs executive branch. Skin in the game (i.e. ETH holdings) could be required to participate and vote in these debates in order to align incentives around seeking out the best solution to the topics being discussed. My name is Mattison Asher, and I am incredibly interested in working with other community members to build this new Ethereum social governance medium. Would love to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts.

I think Politeia is a terrific start, though could be significantly improved upon and adapted to better fit the Ethereum community. What Politeia Does Well   Host effective votes on where treasury funds should be allocated   Facilitates productive debate   Requires a user to have DCR to participate in voting   Standardizes times for voting (ex 1 week for voting)   What Could be Improved Upon   Hosting debates and voting on not only topics that pertain to where treasury funds should be allocated, but also key protocol changes that dramatically affect the entire network such as ProgPOW implementation   Publicizing these debates and discussions in order to increase community participation through social media and crypto publications (like get out the vote campaigns)   Having a standardized time for how long discussion can occur before a vote (i.e. 2 weeks, 1 month, etc.) rather than having the proposal maker arbitrarily choose when the voting period should begin   Making the UI of the application more gamey/accessible rather than sterile   Categorizing discussion topics (ex. scaling, BD funding, consensus algorithm changes, etc.)   Allowing users to make social media profiles on the application that display more of who they are/what interests they represent (i.e. indications that they are/representing miners, applications like MakerDAO, core devs, etc)   In short, I think something like Politeia is a good base/example to start from, but believe this new social governance layer for Ethereum could be a far more effective tool for aligning the Ethereum community.

Having this sort of application in place will give the Ethereum community the tools it needs to reach a more comprehensive social consensus around governance topics that deserve attention.

Additionally, better to have this application in place before the next contentious debate (whether it be on ProgPOW or something else) so that the community has a way of effectively voicing their opinion on these contentious issues that can be quantitatively measured.

It is important to very clearly describe the problem, which I often describe as a protocol decision process which lacks coordination and full representation from stakeholders (perhaps more a qualitative problem than quantitative). Such a governance layer has been discussed widely (usually it is on Twitter in recent years). Often efforts get hung up 1. age old and somewhat circular discussions of the nature of governance, and 2. apathy. Formal democratic governance of the protocol and related tech is not likely at this point, but something more than what is accomplished in the EIP process and core devs calls is needed for legitimacy and representation. Still, the current process, particularly for advancing the protocol and maintaining the health of the network, is functioning fairly well IMO. What can happen \u201cnow\u201d is to organize people and build structures for gathering logic and measuring sentiment, and to do this around key issues. Such a process can then iterative gain legitimacy. @lrettig makes a very good suggestion w/  Politeia. Another one being looked at by some in the community is kialo. We should also very closely examine pol.is. This software is being used for civic participation in Taiwan by Audrey Tang (an open source dev and government minister who spoke at Devcon5).    The Christian Science Monitor \u2013 8 Apr 20    The web\u2019s a threat to democracy? Think again, Taiwan says. Taiwan\u2019s digital minister Audrey Tang is leading a charge to make technology strengthen democracy, not undermine it.      ",

I see this new application as complimentary support for the core developers overseeing the EIP process. It might be useful for them to have ways to measure sentiment, as you mentioned. Agreed that formal complete democratic governance cannot be fully implemented at this time. Agreed that one of the core functions of this new application will be to organize people and build structures for gathering logic and measuring sentiment around key areas, which will then lead to an increase in legitimacy. Those are some great options you presented with Politeia, Kialo, and Poli.is. That being said, I think creating a stand alone app that\u2019s completely devoted to this function would also be a terrific option. We could integrate applications such as Metamask so that we know that the people who are participating have some sort of stake in Ethereum (i.e. skin in the game).

Instead of simply voting for an item and having the majority of the group getting their way, a group using consensus is committed to finding solutions that everyone actively supports, or at least can live with.  This ensures that all opinions, ideas and concerns are taken into account. Through listening closely to each other, the group aims to come up with proposals that work for everyone. \u2026 In this guide you\u2019ll find lots of information to help you make decisions using consensus, including why you might use it, the basic principles and process, how to apply it to larger groups of people and ideas for dealing with common problems. We also have a short guide to consensus, and our guide Facilitating meetings contains lots of tips for making your consensus meetings run smoothly.

I see more of the apathy come from the fact that any mechanism that\u2019s implemented or suggested above would have an accountability that extends beyond capital interests. From my point of view, there is a huge conflation in this discussion (and the meta) about what is rational from a technical perspective and what is rational as defined by economic game theory. It is technically sound to implement ProgPow (no matter how many iterations it takes, what vulnerabilities are uncovered from the current implementation etc. to fulfill the original security guarantees in the yellow paper, the core devs seem to agree with me), but in this current impasse, economically infeasible to some of the largest shareholders in the space who fund client teams and operate Dapps. The closer we get to 2.0 the less there is an incentive to actually resolve the issues that caused this contentious debate in the first place. And those that benefit the most from obfuscating how the process actually works will continue to force poor technical decisions onto smaller shareholders. Ruling by committee by those who do not have enough context to actually make educated decisions is worrisome, but I argue that outcome would be less likely if it was clear who was speaking to what types of changes to the protocol as purely social reputation and technical credibility matters more than we\u2019d like to admit, especially since this discussion has its roots in trying to engineer our way out of this political problem.

The amazing gem he points to is Argdown, a Markdown-style syntax and display framework for complex argumentation. Of course this is only one piece in the puzzle, but as an artifact it can do wonders. A common format enables facilitators to maintain a mental map of the key arguments and findings in any discussion. This helps ensure that key information is not overlooked, that concerns from relevant stakeholders are more likely to be \u201con the table\u201d as the decision is being made.

Contribute to christianvoigt/argdown development by creating an account on GitHub.      @masher, perhaps this can be used in The Ether. Perhaps we can try to use it in those community discussions which become epic, taking the big arguments and assembling an argument summary document in the same vein as @souptacular did for ProgPOW in the Arguments pros and cons section.

Social Governance in our view is more about gauging what the community thinks about various topics so you as a Core Developer have that data set at hand about why the community thinks a certain way when making your independent decisions. That data set is just one piece of a larger framework Core Devs use to make a decision. The process already exists right now, it is just inefficient because it stems from eyeballing Twitter conversations, which isn\u2019t effective. Furthermore, the way we envision social governance is exactly what you have outlined.

The term governance is usually understood as implying far more than just gauging sentiment. It is tied to the authority, decision-making and rules of a social system.

The reason why we used the word \u201cgovernance\u201d is because this sort of building community support and gauging sentiment for EIPs is outlined as part of Ethereum\u2019s governance process in EIP-1. EIP authors are supposed to invite \u201cthe community to give feedback\u201d and should \u201ctry and gauge whether the interest in the EIP is commensurate with both the work involved in implementing it and how many parties will have to conform to it.\u201d Furthermore, EIP-1 states that \u201cnegative community feedback will be taken into consideration and may prevent your EIP from moving past the Draft stage.\u201d Finally, according to EIP-1, there is language that suggests that \u201cvarious stakeholders are well-represented\u201d in providing input to EIPs. According to EIP-1, gauging community sentiment is part of the Ethereum governance process. We are not trying to change Ethereum\u2019s governance process at all, but merely desire to fulfill what is outlined in EIP-1. ",

(Having said that, I\u2019d question the utility of anchoring on that term. Being part of the governance process has such a wide scope that it\u2019s an almost meaningless clarification. This message is part of the governance process. As is almost everything we do.) The issue is that this is not a governance layer. A governance layer is usually thought of as encompassing the authority, decision-making and rules of a social system. As such, it concerns the distribution and exercise of power. As far as I understand, what you are proposing is a sentiment gauging layer to aid in the governance process. This layer, by itself, has no power to do anything. As such, calling it a governance layer is at best inaccurate, and at worst dangerously misleading. (To be frank, what worries me even more is your use of the terms legislative branch and power structures. This suggests to me that you either have ambitions that go past a sentiment gauging layer and encompass reforming and/or formalising existing power structures, or you haven\u2019t thought clearly enough about the scope of this proposal) ",

We are trying to create a sentiment gauging layer to aid in the governance process, and this layer by itself has no power to do anything. I admit that my diction in the original post was not always on point. The first post more reflects the initial burst of energy around the project, and I agree I used metaphors that don\u2019t make sense and also could be interpreted in ways I did not mean. As the project has developed from the initial post in April, we have moved away from terms like \u201clayer\u201d and never utilize the \u201clegislative branch\u201d metaphor. In fact, in all of our official public facing materials (i.e. medium posts, tweets, etc.), we never use the words \u201clayer\u201d or \u201clegislative branch\u201d in reference to what we are creating. Our Medium is here and our Twitter is here if you would like to do a quick word search. We are definitely not attempting to reform or formalize existing power structures. Our goal is to provide whatever power structure that currently exists a tool to gauge sentiment that they can then utilize when making decisions. Note that the current power structure of course does not have to go with what the sentiment shows, but we do believe having a more comprehensive sentiment gauging tool is better than the current process of eyeballing Twitter to gauge sentiment.
