The MIP65 was too narrow leading to a block, so the new wording is designed to avoid another similar unfortunate situation (changing MIP65 now would cost 2-3 months!). When this MIP4 was written (2 weeks ago), the situation was also less clear. Any community member with legal credential can post, but you also need a facilitators to validate. Facilitator have some trust from MKR holders. That seemed a good tradeoff. I can confirm that @christiancdpetersen is working on MIP65. ",
