ETH Staking Services by MakerDAO \u2122: It is known to many that ethereum staking services can and will capture a large portion of eth\u2019s working capital in the long run, this leaves me thinking that these services have the opportunity to be able to issue any form of stablecoin, since they are the owners of the staking interface and the interest generated by it. What is your opinion in relation to makerDAO creating a staking service where the stability fee is directly absorbed from the staking interests? Permissioned / Permissionless Lending Pools by MakerDAO \u2122: Creation of an AAVE / compound both Permissioned (Like AAVE Pro / Compound Prime) and Permissionless. Surplus funds could even be used to grant extra yield as an incentive mechanism for liquidity while at the same time it is a very easy product to implement at the institutional level and being the ideal match for Vaults. What is your opinion in relation to this type of lending pools? All this arises because I feel that we have to use the capital we have to create products that reaffirm makerdao as a leader, in pursuit of an ideal called \"Maker Nation\" In this Maker Nation, I would like to see a whole range of Dai-based products where each of them is hierarchically connected to another, always having Dai and Vaults as the beating heart.

I am personally much more interested in seeing the staking derivatives from other services used as collateral in MakerDAO. Staking services are a highly competitive market with winner-take-all tendencies/power law success distributions\u2013I expect operating margins to be thin, and scaling challenging unless we\u2019re one of the top services (hard to do when it isn\u2019t your #1 focus). Building something like that also requires the DAO to invest in physical infrastructure in one or more specific jurisdictions, or to establish financial relationships with entities that provide those physical resources. It\u2019s not clear to me if the advantages from running our own staking service (i.e. a more trustworthy staking derivative, no middleman, and deeper possibilities for integration with the rest of the protocol) outweigh the risks and high costs of doing so. IMO it\u2019s probably a distraction from our core business until that reaches a scale where it\u2019s feasible to spin up completely new lines of business.  What is your opinion in relation to this type of lending pools?  Not sure I fully understand the idea, but\u2013I think you\u2019re suggesting expanding the financial services offered by the DAO to directly include a Compound/AAVE-like product that would directly compete with those other lending protocols. I have some similar opinions here as mentioned above\u2013I think at the moment it would distract from the core mission of growing DAI as a currency. It also jeopardizes cross-protocol efforts like the Direct Deposit Module (an AAVE integration that creates DAI supply in certain interest rate regimes). An idea that\u2019s been floated around is some sort of attached lending market where Vault users can opt-in to making their collateral available for borrowing (they\u2019d get a cut of the interest for taking additional risk, partially offsetting their stability fees). This would increase the risk to DAI though, so I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea. That said this sort of \u201cvertical integration\u201d (i.e. offering a full stack of financial services) is certainly a direction the DAO could choose to grow in. ",

Few human resources are diverted from current efforts. So either a current team with available slack does it, or new recruits. Economically good for Maker because Maker would be commoditizing its complement (a very powerful way to look at many Maker activities I believe), economically good for stakers due to low rates, economically good for the operational team because being Maker-backed gives them a competitive edge. As with all activities that are not fully onchain, details of how Maker ensures the staking business stays under the control of governance have to be fully sorted out.  ",

                    "content": "Kurt, thanks for your detailed answer, always a pleasure to discuss things with you. Please see below my responses.  Staking services are a highly competitive market with winner-take-all tendencies/power law success distributions\u2013I expect operating margins to be thin, and scaling challenging unless we\u2019re one of the top services (hard to do when it isn\u2019t your #1 focus)  The idea behind this is not to obtain a \u201csignificant\u201d margin but rather is about horizontal expansion to offer more services that we can connect with DAI regardless of whether we are a TOP service or not. In my mind Focus # 1 is growing Dai and the DAO.  As a base, we have a collateralized stablecoin issuance system that is the envy of many and I think it is our duty to expand the capabilities of the possible byproducts that this building block can give us. We are in a nascent and tremendously competitive industry, where every minute more and more capital is deployed, far greater than ours, and from my strategic point of view, we have to act first (which is our advantage) to cut chances for other players.   Building something like that also requires the DAO to invest in physical infrastructure in one or more specific jurisdictions, or to establish financial relationships with entities that provide those physical resources.  Yes, if we want to achieve the vision that we have for DAI we will definitely need to establish financial relationships with entities around the world.   It\u2019s not clear to me if the advantages from running our own staking service (i.e. a more trustworthy staking derivative, no middleman, and deeper possibilities for integration with the rest of the protocol) outweigh the risks and high costs of doing so  In competitive environments, it is often much more expensive not to develop a business line. Take a look at our run rate, mostly comprised of people (salaries).  image1280\u00d7406 87.1 KB    IMO it\u2019s probably a distraction from our core business until that reaches a scale where it\u2019s feasible to spin up completely new lines of business.  The point is that the consensus on what MakerDAO\u2019s core business is is practically nil, almost all members of the community have a great vision of what DAI should be, but very few propose HOW to reach that vision. Does Starbucks sell just Coffee? Does Apple sell just Phones? Also, is not clear what scale we should reach to create new lines of business, if we have the opportunity and the capacity, I think we should take advantage of it. Is it easy? No Will it cost money? Yes We will need to work our asses off? Definitely, that is why we are here.   Not sure I fully understand the idea, but\u2013I think you\u2019re suggesting expanding the financial services offered by the DAO to directly include a Compound/AAVE-like product that would directly compete with those other lending protocols. I have some similar opinions here as mentioned above\u2013I think at the moment it would distract from the core mission of growing DAI as a currency.  Yes, competition will always exist and we have to be prepared for it. The problem that I see with just \u201cDai as currency\u201d is that is limited to be a  type of commodity. Nowadays, the \u201cDollar parity\u201d is the proposition sought after by everyone in order to create financial services, this is very easy to achieve, either via USDC, USDT, or any other stablecoin, if we limit DAI within This category of \u201cas a currency\u201d we do not have any type of weapons to fight against other options. Even in terms of regulation, which sooner or later will arrive, Dai is at a serious disadvantage compared to the options mentioned, that is why I want to bring to the table that the core mission of the Dao is to grow an entire ecosystem around DAI so we can avoid that \u201ccommodity label\u201d and be able to generate a differentiator and a stronger value proposition than any other stablecoin out there.   It also jeopardizes cross-protocol efforts like the Direct Deposit Module (an AAVE integration that creates DAI supply in certain interest rate regimes).  Cross protocol efforts will never be more important than the protocol itself. If we build a useful ecosystem, they will build things anyway.   An idea that\u2019s been floated around is some sort of attached lending market where Vault users can opt-in to making their collateral available for borrowing (they\u2019d get a cut of the interest for taking additional risk, partially offsetting their stability fees).  This is neat!   -That said this sort of \u201cvertical integration\u201d (i.e. offering a full stack of financial services) is certainly a direction the DAO could choose to grow in.  I really hope so.  I\u2019m starting to see a dichotomy where we need to think and define if we want to be some sort of \u201cpublic good\u201d and grow because we are sailing the good waters and tailwind of the industry or if we want to become a powerful ecosystem with Dai & MKR (DAI as an Appstore analogy) at the middle and craft our own destiny. I lean towards the latter. ",

                    "content": "Going to reply to a few things at once here: @someone said:  I believe offering staking services  will be critical, or we risk being losing a lot of ETH collateral to services that do offer it.  I don\u2019t get this argument. The market has already provided liquid staking derivatives that will make very viable collateral. Everyone seems to agree that the top priority right now is DAI supply; well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get significantly more supply by building our own staking service versus onboarding derivatives of the large, successful services that already exist. @Planet_X said:  It is perhaps not a whole future product idea but I would like Maker to integrate derivatives and risk products such as the ones being developed by Barnbridge. More choice, better risk spread, more liquidations, more profit.  I agree that there are a lot possibilities in this space\u2013I think the market is telling us that the Vault model could be a lot more attractive. I think we might see some \u201cvariations on the theme\u201d come out of the work on institutional Vaults ongoing right now. At the same time, we should ignore it when the market solves problems for us\u2013see e.g. all the work B.Protocol has been doing to make liquidations backstopped and thus allow more capital-efficient Vaults. If their developments prove out, integrating more closely with them is a win-win. Now finally to the points raised by @MarianoDP :):  In my mind Focus # 1 is growing Dai and the DAO.  Completely agree. IMO, DAI as a business only makes sense if we can scale it. And to be clear, by \u201cscale it\u201d I mean hundreds of billions, probably trillions, of DAI.  We are in a nascent and tremendously competitive industry, where every minute more and more capital is deployed, far greater than ours, and from my strategic point of view, we have to act first (which is our advantage) to cut chances for other players.  I think we\u2019re at a stage where we can choose between playing one game well and hopefully winning, or playing a bunch of games in a mediocre fashion. And to be quite honest, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re playing that one game particularly well right now. We are struggling with governance (look at how hard it is to just pass executives lately). We are struggling with supply. We are struggling communication and organization. I do not see now as the time to spin up orthogonal efforts and distract from the very real challenges at hand. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve \u201cwon\u201d the decentralized stablecoin market by any means, especially not given the multichain future that seems to be emerging\u2013if we don\u2019t keep on top of that, we might wake up to find our lunch being eaten.  In competitive environments, it is often much more expensive not to develop a business line.   Does Starbucks sell just Coffee? Does Apple sell just Phones?  Google has a lot of varied business and product lines now, but they started out by winning search market and monetizing it effectively. When I look at the size of the opportunity represented by growing DAI into a bona fide world currency, I feel like we are in a similar position to the early days of Google. Turning Maker into some sort of financial services omnibus today just seems like the wrong order of operations to me. Going head-to-head with every other DeFi protocol will create integration friction and drain resources. Another lesson might be to look at how companies that compete with Amazon in retail actively avoid using AWS. I see the core Maker protocol as analogous to AWS, and if we decide to start competing in other areas, those new competitors are going to be a lot less receptive to building on the core protocol, using Vaults, or integrating DAI. I\u2019d rather make our AWS better\u2013more Vault types, more collaterals, more RWA integrations, better liquidations, better stability mechanisms, more robust governance, DAI bridging to and generation on L2s/other chains, etc\u2013than try to spin up tangential lines of business.  I don\u2019t disagree that at some point, spinning up these more orthogonal things will be a worthwhile investment. But for now, the DAI supply/demand flywheel is the thing I find most compelling to focus on. ",

Everyone seems to agree that the top priority right now is DAI supply; well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get significantly more supply by building our own staking service versus onboarding derivatives of the large, successful services that already exist.     First off, I definitely think we should onboard Lido\u2019s stETH and any others that make sense. Creating our own staking solution is not a substitute for that.   I guess the question is how much more DAI supply we would get if, in addition to onboarding stETH etc, MakerDAO offered a vault type where people could directly deposit ETH with us and we would stake it on their behalf. I believe that the answer is \u201ca lot more supply\u201d; here are a few speculative reasons:  If you gave current ETH vault holders the option to magically swap their vaults for ones where their ETH was earning staking rewards (even with the risk of slashing), I believe a significant fraction would want to do it. I think we could offer a lower commission than pools. Many users would prefer to deal only with MakerDAO rather than with a pool + MakerDAO. There could be many reasons for this:  MakerDAO has a sterling reputation that\u2019s almost as old as Ethereum. Staking pools are all new. Some institutions require approval for every entity they deal with. For institutions that have already gotten approval to work with MakerDAO, it would be much easier to stay with us than close a vault, get approval to work with a pool, get the other token, and then come back to open a new vault. Less technical users feel some fear every time they click \u201csend\u201d. The fewer transactions, the better.   Many less savvy users don\u2019t even know staking rewards are possible. If they were to go to defirate.com and see a negative interest rate for borrowing from Maker, I believe it would drive growth. (If we don\u2019t do it, someone will.)    But those are just speculations. Perhaps @Growth-Core-Unit could survey current or prospective users to get some data? ",

In the very long term, what proportion of the total ETH supply do we estimate will end up being staked? Why would ETH holders not stake their ETH if there are frictionless ways to stake, earn rewards, and take out cheap loans to do whatever else they were going to do? (Note that Coinbase covers the cost of slashing, so there\u2019s no risk to the user; probably why they have the higher 25% fee.) Who will come to Maker to:  open a regular ETH vault, not earning staking rewards or, go to Lido, get stETH, and then open a stETH vault  if they\u2019re able to borrow USDC against a risk-free staked ETH2 deposit at Coinbase?
