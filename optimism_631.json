                    "content": " Background The data team at OP Labs has been working on tracking OP distributions across governance grants, partner funding, and other sources. We first shared early insights in Oct 2022. Takeaways then:  Projects were deploying OP too slowly (34% of approved OP was deployed). Proposals approved via governance were less effective than other programs.  This doc serves to update data and case studies, and begin open-sourcing the data so others can analyze & contribute. A snapshot of program data was taken on Mar 13, 2023  Current Deployment Status - Growth Experiments   We project that 56% of allocated OP (30.7M) has been deployed (not in projects\u2019 wallets)  We\u2019ve observed 38 growth experiment proposals launch or complete, with 32 to be launched. Live & Completed programs represent 80% (43.7M) of Allocated OP (i.e. 24% of allocated OP is \u201clive\u201d and to-be-deployed).        # Programs # OP Allocated (M) % OP Allocated     Live \u200e\ud83d\udd25 Subtotal 33 41.1M 75%   Governance - Season 3  - -    Governance - Season 2  10 7.1M    Governance - Season 1  9 4.5M    Governance - Phase 0  14 29.5M    Coming soon \u200e\u23f3 Subtotal 32 10.9M 20%   Governance - Season 3  12 2.1M    Governance - Season 2  13 5.2M    Governance - Season 1  4 1.3M    Governance - Phase 0  3 2.2M    Completed Subtotal 5 2.6M 5%   Governance - Season 3  - -    Governance - Season 2  1 240.0K    Governance - Season 1  - -    Governance - Phase 0  4 2.4M    Grand Total  70 54.6M        Source: OP Summer Programs  Stats by Season  Aggregate by Gov Fund Season  Stats were measured at the Latest Date (Note: Many programs still ongoing)     Source # OP Allocated Net OP Deployed Net $ Inflow Net $ Inflow / OP Incremental # Txs Annualized # Txs / OP Incremental Gas Fee ($) Annualized Gas Fee / OP     Governance - Phase 0 31.0M 16.8M 128.1M $7.61 16,775 0.36 123,940 2.6872   Governance - Season 1 4.5M 2.0M 111.6M $54.46 3,378 0.60 16,887 3.0086   Governance - Season 2 2.5M 978.0K 16.9M $17.23 1,214 0.45 5,154 1.9234   Multiple 8.9M 6.9M 227.0M $32.69 10,701 0.56 33,508 1.7607     Revisited Case Studies & Early Theories Note: We are mentioning specific programs.

Retention Problem: Separate \u201cUsage Acquisition\u201d vs \u201cLonger-Term Impact\u201d Theory: Incentives are great at \u201cusage acquisition\u201d (transaction volume, liquidity, etc), but this is not a good predictor of longer-term impact.

Theory: When Rewards > Costs, value-maximizing actors will spend to eat up the rewards. Anything that can be gamed, will be gamed.   Aave - Oversized Emissions Led to Recursive Borrowing  Aave \u2018Deposit APY\u2019 + Rewards > Aave \u2018Borrow APY\u2019, so actors borrowed and re-deposited the same asset over and over to maximize rewards  Learning: Unless ****we can design a system where Rewards < \u2018Borrow APY\u2019 - \u2018Deposit APY\u2019, lending rewards may always be gamed.

Base rewards were partial gas rebates, but there was an additional 52K OP bonus to the top 100 addresses by trade volume (as of Mar 5).  On the last day, trade volume spiked to $12M, likely by addresses trying to get in the top 100. Trade volume fell to $25k Trade Volume / Day post-program (vs ~$4k prior), showing that the increased volume did not sustain.  image1025\u00d7476 47.3 KB      This was similar to Slingshot\u2019s Flash Programs we observed last time: Rewards were offered either per trade or per $ of volume until they ran out.

With LooksRare and X2Y2 introducing tokens rewards for trading, we\u2019ve seen a significant increase in NFT wash trade volumes (58% of the NFT secondary volume was wash trading in 2022). Wash trade volume may disappear once the incentives become less attractive or profitable for traders (starting Sep 2022).  image970\u00d7474 28.3 KB   Source: NFT Wash Trading Dashboard (hildobby)     What drives long-term impact? (The real unanswered question) Theory: We can bootstrap a network with supply incentives, but demand needs to follow, and that comes from natural product usage (need to be careful to not create fabricated demand) Aave - Non-Recursive Borrowing had ~60% Retention  While only 18% of Aave TVL retained, 58% of \u201cnon-recursive\u201d borrow volume retained 30-days later (+$30.6M vs pre-incentives).

Please help  There are also infinite more rabbit holes we could go down We\u2019re thinking about better metrics than raw transactions, volume, and TVL (i.e. app fees, transfer volume, incentivized vs native yield) and deeper-dive methods (i.e. segment by behavior type). Open to ideas! Splitting by grants and by season may get increasingly difficult over time, since protocols are re-applying for grants and using the same addresses.  In a perfect world, every proposal uses completely distinct addresses, but may be infeasible.   For simplicity: Thales and Overtime Markets were combined since they each used the same proposal address (we can\u2019t easily tell the grants apart)  This post is coauthored with @MSilb7. ",
