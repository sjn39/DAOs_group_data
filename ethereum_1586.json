I want to discuss potential options to remove untransferrable, scam (honeypot) ERC20 tokens from a wallet: tokens that have their contract locked or paused specifically to steal users funds through UniSwap etc.    Etherscan Information Center \u2013 5 Dec 19    ERC-20 Token Transfer Might Have Failed There are times when an ERC-20 token transfer might have failed and this article lists some of the common reasons.      Is it possible, in theory, to remove or \u2018hard burn\u2019 untransferrable tokens from a wallet? I know most think it\u2019s probably not an important issue, and you could just start fresh with a new wallet \u2013 but with the growth of ENS, I would argue having sovereigny over the contents of our wallets is more important than ever. Is it technically feasible to propose an update that could implement a way to \u2018hard burn\u2019 anything in your wallet, overriding the locked or paused ERC20 contract? Could obvoious scam tokens ever be dropped with The Purge? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts, and explore possibilities and hopefully learn some valuable info in the process. Thank you  ",
