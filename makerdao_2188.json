Yes, I\u2019ve personally read the document, including the appendix document.     sorenpeter:  Which types of tangible and intangible assets will you be producing with the funding received from MakerDAO?   DICU has been producing intangible assets related to data analytics, including but not limited to code for data extraction, data processing, data visualisation and data analysis.     sorenpeter:   Will the assets produced using MakerDAO funding be made available as public goods for the whole DAO?    Yes, all our work is regarded as public goods.     sorenpeter:   Will appropriate Open Source Software/Creative Commons licenses be applied to the assets produced?    Yes, as defined in Guidance for MakerDAO software developers on how to assign Copyright. Will Copyright for those assets be assigned to the Dai Foundation that has as its mandate to safeguard MakerDAO intangible assets? Yes, as defined in Guidance for MakerDAO software developers on how to assign Copyright.     sorenpeter:   Will you integrate the Dai Foundation Contributor License Agreement Assistant in your Github repositories?    Could you provide more information regarding this? I don\u2019t think I fully understand the value of it. We have contracts with our contributors that define that all work done is owned by the Dai Foundation.     sorenpeter:   Will the source code/material for the assets be made publicly available? How?    Yes. We currently run most of our actively developed repos in private within the github organization makerdao-data. Once the repo is in production and there is a minimum level of documentation presented (most likely limited to a readme file), we will request the mirroring of it in the official makerdao repo.     sorenpeter:   Besides the MakerDAO Forum and MakerDAO Discord, which communication channels do your core unit plan to use to communicate on behalf of MakerDAO according to your mandate?    We currently maintain a few web-apps and a Notion page used as a CU website; all of them are targeted to be folded into a single web-app (makerdao.fyi). We also maintain a free and public Data API.     sorenpeter:   Will you ensure that relevant publishing/community websites, email and SoMe accounts and associated DNS and ENS domains used for official MakerDAO communication for which you hold Content Management rights are under ownership of Dai Foundation to ensure ultimate Maker Governance control of who is using these channels?    Yes, all assets managed by the Core Unit are owned by the Dai Foundation. For practical considerations, when we are heavily developing using an asset, we maintain control of it and then transfer it to Dai Foundation to be managed by their service provider, currently TechOps. This is currently the case for the domain makerdao.fyi.     sorenpeter:   If you register any trademarks to represent MakerDAO funded solutions will you transfer those trademarks to Dai Foundation for safe keeping?    Yes, this is currently not applicable as we have not registered any trademarks. ",

Could you provide more information regarding this? I don\u2019t think I fully understand the value of it. We have contracts with our contributors that define that all work done is owned by the Dai Foundation.   When the CLA Assistant is integrated with a repository it check/ensures that all contributors before making a pull request have accepted the MakerDAO Individual Contributor License Agreement. It is optional to use the CLA Assistant, but it should be able to save you some work if you for example have some code where you are ready to accept contributions from external developers.     tadeo:      sorenpeter:   Will the source code/material for the assets be made publicly available?
