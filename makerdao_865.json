A month later, bounties for these bugs are still being negotiated. A great deal of time was spent trying to find resolutions that seemed fair to both sides, for the whitehats and DUX. The change here would give more discretion to IS-001 to determine the bug bounty scope. This will allow us to refine the rules to reduce gray areas and potential disagreements.

For clarification, the actual change to MIP64 included in the pull request is this one:  image1097\u00d7162 13.8 KB  So:   As with every bug bounty program, there is the bug bounty scope (Accepted Impacts) as defined on the MakerDAO project page on the Immunefi website.   That scope was originally defined in MIP64. And the language implied that only that original scope in the MIP64 would be allowed as scope on the Immunefi site, or MIP64 would have to be updated first through the usual Maker governance process.   The amendment implies that changes can be made to the scope on the Immunefi website without the need to change MIP64 every time via de MIPs process first.
