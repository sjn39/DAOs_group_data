Recent examples (see MKT-001 offboarding: 1, 2, 3) have demonstrated several gaps in this process. Ratifying simple changes started small and, along the way, the ambitions grew into revisions for much of the Core Unit MIP Set. Thanks to generous contributions from GovAlpha we now have a cohesive MIP Set.  The aim is to reduce harm to the DAO and community in the event of Core Unit disruptions. These changes are an attempt to make processes more transparent and orderly. In addition, edits to MIP38, MIP39, and MIP41 fill in process gaps, or streamline them, with additional documentation and/or templates. This comprehensive set of changes should inspire substantive discussion surrounding an offboarding proposal prior to a vote. It will also make tracking and editing Core Unit MIPs simpler.  Additional Information Please note that this amendment assumes the passing of the new Core Unit Budget process. Against the spirit of MIP4, this is a considerably large amendment. However, given how deeply entrenched in the DAO the Core Unit framework is, we decided that the continuity of the MIP Set is worth the venial offense. As stated in MIP4, it is ultimately up to the community whether an amendment is appropriate for any given case. This amendment is a development of the original amendment published by @GFXLabs. Our gratitude to them for kickstarting the initiative.  Goals  Solidify the Core Unit offboarding process.  Simplifiy and templatize the process for offboarding. Clarify offboarding terms within the governance cycle. Establish a standard for proposers.   Introduce and format expectations on timeline, work plans, and budgets. Make the offboarding process reference the new Core Unit Budget process (pending approval). Add templates where appropriate or finalize WIP from the original MIP4. Propose an unwinding plan for core units with legacy budgets as the revised MIP40 came along.

Thanks for the nudge, @flipflopflapdelegate, and sorry @everyone for the extra reading.  Tl; Dr Other than MIP editor quality of life improvements and shaping some processes, the most significant change is that you need just one MIP subcomponent to remove a core unit. This simplicity is paired with a template to make it more straightforward. But, like all MIPs, you have to do work. Governance, we hope, will have more clarity in an offboarding now. Proposing an offboarding will require the relevant actor to study how a team hasn\u2019t delivered and create an open space to respond to an offboarding. This one subcomponent hasn\u2019t changed much since it first hit the forums four months ago. Short changes:  MIP 38 was confusing. We made it less confusing and put the framework for CU\u2019s in there. MIP 39 needed an overhaul. We added mentions to the requisite MIPs (38 & 41) that were missing. We finalized the framework definition. We made some flowcharts because it was tough to think them through. MIP41 had a lot of holes. There is mention of a process, but it\u2019s not defined; we had no plans if core units lose facilitators, and we need to clean up the language around facilitators. We also defined retirement, so we got that going for us.  I\u2019m adding summaries and full text in each subsequent post here for maximum transparency. s/o to @adcv, I\u2019m stealing that format.

Core Units define long-term work areas and cover a broad set of responsibilities or focus. They are the basic units of work that Maker Governance is able to oversee, manage and prioritize.  ## Specification / Proposal Details  - ### MIP39c1: Core Units + ### MIP39c1: Core Unit Mandate  - **What is a Core Unit?** + Mandates are self-imposed declarations that define the work scope and responsibilities for any given Core Unit. Mandates are initially ratified at onboarding time, but they can be modified at a later time via single MIP39c2 subproposals.  - A Core Unit is a structure that has a budget attached to it, managed by one or more Facilitators, that coordinate and pay contributors working to achieve a long-term goal within MakerDAO. + In the interest of being flexible, relatively broad and open-ended Mandates are to be preferred over granular Mandates. In the interest of promoting redundancy, parallelization, and decentralization within the DAO, Mandates can overlap across Core Units.  - Core Units are proposed by community members and voted on by Maker Governance. Each Core Unit may have a budget (MIP40). The Facilitators (MIP41) of a Core Unit may have additional permissions over the Maker Protocol or Governance Processes depending on their Core Unit's nature. + Mandates are one of the three fundamental entities that define a Core Unit along with Budgets and Facilitators. The interaction among these entities is lay out in MIP38.  - **Core Unit Mandates** + ### MIP39c2: Adding/Modifying Core Units  - Core Unit Mandates set the direction of the work that Facilitators must help carry out by using their budget and exercising their Governance Powers. + MIP39c2 subproposals spearhead the onboarding of Core Units by defining their name and Mandate. Alternatively, when applied singly on a ratified Core Unit, MIP39c2 subproposals can be used to modify its name or Mandate or both.  - Mandates should be high-level and avoid trying to micromanage the Core Unit processes; instead, they should be broad, open-ended and give room for manoeuvre so as not to stifle the Facilitators' ability to come up with innovative solutions and efficient processes. + #### Core Unit Onboarding Process  - Mandates can be regarded as \"questions\" for Facilitators to \"answer\" with their Facilitator Commitment (MIP41) when proposing to be onboarded to a given Core Unit. + A Core Unit is brought into existence within MakerDAO upon the simultaneous, bundled ratification of at least three subproposals:  - Mandates from different Core Units can overlap to create redundancy and parallelize and decentralize work within the DAO. + - One MIP39c2 subproposal that defines its name and *Mandate*. + - One MIP40c3 subproposal that defines its *Budget*. + - One or more MIP41c4 subproposals that define its *Facilitators*.  - **Core Objectives and Domains** + In the particular case of Governance Core Units, their Core Unit ID must have the prefix `GOV`.   - Core Objectives and Domains are not directly defined in the DAO Primitives MIP Set but are flexible concepts that emerge through the interaction of DAO Primitives. + Although these subproposals can fulfill their Feedback and Frozen Periods independently, they need to be formally submitted at the same time.  - Core Units are at the intersection of Domains (which denote skill sets and capabilities) and Objectives (which denote cross-domain long term workstreams.) + Upon Formal Submission, these subproposals will be bundled into one single, binary Ratification Poll that can be either fully rejected or fully accepted.  - A Core Unit can participate in multiple objectives and can fall under one or more domains. + |![](https://i.imgur.com/i8SO7AI.png)| + |--| + | Subproposals involved in the Core Unit onboarding process.

The Operational Support Core Unit, or the MIP Editor or Governance Facilitator, will also assign a Core Unit ID (e.g.: `GOV1`) to uniquely identify the given Core Unit. + The parameters for MIP39c2 subproposals are:  - The proposal parameters are: - Minimum feedback period: 1 month. - Minimum frozen period: 1 week. + - **Minimum Feedback Period**: 1 month. + - **Minimum Frozen Period**: 1 week. + - **Governance Cycle**: Monthly.  MIP39c2 subproposals must use the template located at [MIP39c2-Subproposal-Template.md](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP39/MIP39c2-Subproposal-Template.md).  - --- + ### MIP39c3: Offboarding Core Units (Process Component)  + Core Units can be offboarded from MakerDAO by utilizing MIP39c3 subproposals. The ratification of a MIP39c3 subproposal triggers the following sequence of events:  + - Determining who will be executing the unwinding plan: +    - The Retiring Facilitator +    - An Interim Facilitator chosen via the Fallback Process defined in MIP41c6. + - Adapting the Facilitator's permissions to meet the needs of the unwinding plan + - Executing the unwinding plans for the Core Unit   + An offboarded Core Unit should conduct all winding down activities within four months from the ratification date of the offboarding.  + #### Unwinding Execution Plan  + Budgets built after the Core Unit Budget Process ratified via MIP4c2-SP19 include an unwinding plan that defines the tasks to execute at offboarding time and the compensation for them.  - ### MIP39c3: Removing Core Units (Subproposal Process) + Legacy budgets do not include unwinding plans. A broad, default plan and a compensation is provided here for them:  - This subproposal process allows Governance to remove a Core Unit from the DAO Primitives State (MIP38). A Core Unit can only be removed if it has no active budget implementations (see MIP40) and no active facilitators (see MIP41). However, a Core Unit can be offboarded in the same governance cycle as removing its budget and facilitator(s). More precisely, if a Core Unit has no active budget implementation, no active facilitators, no facilitator onboarding proposals in formal submission, and no budget requests in formal submission, no further action is required for the Core Unit to be officially offboarded. + - Transferring intangible MakerDAO assets (access to DAO-claimable platforms, e-mail accounts, websites, etc.) back into the DAO. + - Documenting and delegating the activities previously carried out by the unwinding Core Unit that impact the DAO. To the extent that this is reasonable and possible, provide enough detail so that other Core Units can pick up these activities. + - Settling outstanding debts both to contributors and external actors/services. + - Returning unused funds.  - An Interim Facilitator as referenced in MIP41c6 is not an active facilitator for the purposes of MIP39c3. A Core Unit with an Interim Facilitator conducting winding down activities (such as returning assets to MakerDAO) shall be considered offboarded, even if those winding down activities are not yet complete. + Unwinding compensation will transfer to the Retiring/Interim Facilitator upon completion. The compensation is set to be 33% of the annual salary of the Facilitator of the Core Unit that is being offboarded, as per its latest ratified budget.  - A Core Unit that has been offboarded should conduct all winding down activities within 2 weeks. This includes (but is not limited to) settling outstanding obligations to all contributors, settling any outstanding debts or current obligations of that Core Unit to third parties, orderly transfer of any intangible assets of the DAO to another Core Unit, and return of any DAI in excess of that needed to wind down activities in an orderly manner. + #### Permissions  - The proposal parameters are: - Minimum feedback period 1 month - Minimum frozen period: 1 week + Immediately after the ratification of the offboarding, some of the Facilitators' permissions will be removed.

Core Unit Unwinding \u2013 Funds If the Core Unit does not have an unwinding plan for its funds in its MIP40c3, articulate unwinding costs associated with transitioning work tasks within this MIP39 component. Otherwise use the unwinding and defunding plan from a new MIP40c3 and submit that alongside the offboarding proposal. An unwinding should happen as fast as possible for as little as possible to reduce overhead.

Facilitators are the accountable individuals responsible for interfacing between Maker Governance and the Contributors and different resources to achieve the Core Objectives of the Protocol. Facilitators are always attached to one or more Core Units and cannot exist in a void, i.e., Facilitators are Facilitators only inasmuch as they are attached to at least one Core Unit. + MIP41: Facilitator Framework describes the processes for onboarding and offboarding Core Unit Facilitators. Facilitators are the accountable individuals responsible for interfacing between Maker Governance, the Contributors, and external resources to achieve the Core Objectives of the Protocol. Facilitators are always attached to one or more Core Units and cannot exist in a void, i.e., Facilitators are Facilitators only *if* they are attached to at least one Core Unit.  *MIP41c2: Facilitator Governance Powers** - Specifies the unique powers that Facilitators have when interacting with the Maker Governance processes. + Specifies the Facilitators' unique powers when interacting with the Maker Governance processes.  **MIP41c4: Facilitator Onboarding** - A process component that defines the process for onboarding a new Facilitator to a Core Unit or moving an existing Facilitator to a different Core Unit. + A process component that defines the process for onboarding a Facilitator to a Core Unit.  **MIP41c5: Facilitator Offboarding (Subproposal Process)** - A process component that defines the process for removing a Facilitator from a Core Unit. + A process component that defines the process for removing a Facilitator.  **MIP41c6: Interim Facilitators and the Fallback Decision Process** - Specifies how Interim Facilitators function, the situations where they are necessary, and how they are invoked.  + Specifies what Interim Facilitators are, the situations where they are necessary, and how they are appointed.  ## MIP41c1: The Facilitator Framework  - Facilitators play a key role in the Maker ecosystem by acting as the link between Maker Governance and the Contributors. Facilitators are always attached to a Core Unit that defines their primary responsibility and their Budget and Governance Powers. + Facilitators play a key role in the Maker ecosystem by acting as the link between Maker Governance and the Contributors. Facilitators are always attached to a Core Unit that represents their primary responsibility and their Budget and Governance Powers. The Budget they manage and their Governance Powers are dependent on the existence of that Core Unit.  The Core Unit Budget allows the facilitators to meet their responsibilities by hiring Contributors and purchasing services and products. Facilitators attached to a Core Unit administer the Budget for that Core Unit. How this is implemented in practice depends on the specific Budget Implementation.  - The Facilitator Commitment is an essential part of a Facilitator proposal, where the Facilitator specifies their perspective, in as great detail as possible, on how to successfully achieve the Core Unit Mandate of the Core Unit they are proposing to onboard to, and how they plan to organize and provide accountability into their use of the budget. + The Facilitator Commitment is an essential part of a Facilitator proposal. There, the Facilitator specifies their perspective on how to successfully achieve the Mandate of the Core Unit they will be attached to, how they plan to organize, and how they will develop accountability.  The Facilitator Governance Powers enable the Facilitators to efficiently interact with Maker Governance processes related to their Core Unit.  ### MIP41c2: Facilitator Governance Powers  - Facilitators have special privileges in the Maker Governance Framework due to their trusted status in the Community and the requirements of their role as Facilitator of a Core Unit.  - Facilitators have the power to propose expedited, urgent or emergency Executive Votes (defined in MIP24) related to their Core Unit.  - Facilitators have the power to propose weekly non-standard Governance Polls (defined in MIP16) related to their Core Units.  - Facilitators have the power to propose weekly Executive Votes (defined in MIP16) related to their Core Units. + Facilitators have special privileges in the Maker Governance Framework:  - Facilitator governance powers for particular Core Units can be extended through MIPs.

They may include technical access to smart contracts like multisigs or other privileges in the governance process.  ### MIP41c3: Governance Facilitator Governance Powers  - The Governance Facilitator role is a special case of a Facilitator attached to a Core Unit that contains `GOV` in the Core Unit ID in the DAO Primitives State MIP. + Governance Facilitators have extraordinary powers to respond to their responsibilities listed on [MIP0c10:Governance Facilitator Role](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP0#core-responsibilities).  - Governance Facilitators are fundamental to the operation of the various governance processes and have powers and responsibilities defined in multiple MIPs in relation to this. This includes: - * The MIPs Framework (MIP0). - * The weekly governance cycle (MIP16). - * The urgent and emergency voting processes (MIP24). + In relation to governance processes, Governance Facilitators have exceptional powers and responsibilities. These are defined in multiple MIPs like:  + - The MIPs Framework (MIP0). + - The weekly governance cycle (MIP16). + - The urgent and emergency voting processes (MIP24). + - And others.  Governance Facilitators interpret the meaning of MIPs and their practical consequences.  This process component allows Governance to onboard a new facilitator with a Facilitator Commitment.  - Practical control of the budget of the Core Unit is transferred as a part of this Subproposal process. Depending on the Budget Implementations, a Subproposal may contain a technical state change to modify the Budget Implementation control to correspond to the new Facilitator. -  The proposal parameters are: * Minimum feedback period: 1 month * Minimum frozen period: 1 week  ### MIP41c5: Facilitator offboarding  This process component allows Governance to offboard a Facilitator.  - Depending on the Core Unit's Budget Implementations, this Subproposal may include a technical state change to remove control of the Budget Implementations from the offboarded Facilitator. + If a Core Unit is being offboarded, the Facilitator immediately loses all special powers listed on MIP41c2/ MIP41c3.  + The Facilitator becomes a *Retiring* Facilitator in charge of executing the unwinding process for the offboarding Core Unit (described on MIP39c3). If the Retiring Facilitator fails to execute the unwinding plan, an *Interim* Facilitator - further defined in MIP41c6 - will take over these responsibilities.  + A Facilitator can be offboarded without having the Core Unit they are attached to being offboarded. An Interim Facilitator will take over responsibilities during the transition. A MIP41c4 subproposal proposing a new Facilitator should be submitted by the Interim Facilitator or by any other member of the Community.  + If a Facilitator wishes to voluntarily offboard, a MIP41c4 subproposal proposing a new Facilitator should be submitted by the Interim Facilitator or by any other member of the Community.  + If a Facilitator goes missing, an Interim Facilitator will take over responsibilities during the transition. A MIP41c4 subproposal proposing a new Facilitator should be submitted by the Interim Facilitator or by any other member of the Community.  The proposal parameters are: * Minimum feedback period: 1 month * Minimum frozen period: 1 week  - Once a Subproposal passes, the MIP Editor or Governance Facilitators modify the Core Unit's entry specified by removing the Facilitator's name and information, and their Commitment.  MIP41c5 subproposals must use the template located at [MIP41c5-Subproposal-Template.md](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP41/MIP41c5-Subproposal-Template.md)  ### MIP41c6: Interim Facilitators and the Fallback Decision Process  #### Interim Facilitators  - When the Facilitator of a Core Unit becomes unavailable, an existing permanent Facilitator of another Core Unit is temporarily attached to allow the aforementioned Core Unit to maintain the continuity. + Whenever a Core Unit finds itself with no Facilitator, an Interim Facilitator is needed to fill any gaps. The process to chose the Interim Facilitator is called \"The Fallback Decision Process\" and it is detailed below.  - The Interim Facilitator controls the budget to continue doing regular payouts to core Contributors and pay for other critical expenses and infrastructure while a permanent Core Unit Facilitator is sought. + If a Retiring Facilitator is willing, they may nominate an Interim Facilitator. Subject to the nominated Interim Facilitator's acceptance, they are ratified as the new Facilitator by a simple majority vote of all active facilitators.  - If a Core Unit has no active facilitators as a result of involuntary offboarding and has no active budget, no Interim Facilitator will be appointed unless there are winding down activities (such as returning assets to MakerDAO) that require one. An Interim Facilitator shall not be considered an active facilitator for purposes of MIP39c3. + In the event of a Core Unit offboarding, if the Retiring Facilitator is uncooperative, the Interim Facilitator will be in charge of overseeing/executing the unwinding process. In the event of a Facilitator offboarding, they will be in charge of ensuring the functional continuity of the Core Unit until a new permanent Facilitator is ratified. Interim facilitators should clearly state their intented time of service.  + #### The Fallback Decision Process  + The incentive to volunteer as an Interim Facilitator is the compensation tied to a Core Unit unwinding plan. In the event of a missing, failed succession, or headless core unit, the incentive to volunteer as an Interim Facilitator is a transfer of the former Facilitator's compensation for an interim timeline.  - Interim Facilitators are designated based on the Succession Plan publicly documented by a Core Unit at onboarding. An Interim Facilitator appointed based upon a succession plan must be a current or former member of that Core Unit. + If a Core Unit has no active Facilitators as a result of involuntary offboarding and has no active budget, no Interim Facilitator will be appointed unless there are winding down activities that require one.  - In the event a Core Unit does not have a succession plan publicly documented, or the candidate(s) named in it are not willing or eligible to become Interim Facilitator, the outgoing facilitator may nominate another Interim Facilitator, subject to approval by a simple majority vote of all active facilitators.  - In the event a Core Unit has no succession plan, the candidate(s) are not willing or eligible to become Interim Facilitator, and the outgoing facilitator is unable or unwilling to nominate a candidate able to be approved by majority vote of all active facilitators, the appointment will revert to the Fallback Decision Process, where a simple majority of all currently active Facilitators have to reach an agreement. The Fallback Decision Process can instantly designate an existing Facilitator or existing member of that Core Unit (who must agree to the decision) and assign them as an Interim Facilitator to a Core Unit that is without a Facilitator, or that has a Facilitator who has gone missing.  - #### The Transition + #### The Fallback Decision Process  - Once an Interim Facilitator has been assigned to a Core Unit through the Fallback Decision Process, the Community must then work together to transition over the critical responsibilities that must be maintained to continue operations of the Protocol until a permanent Facilitator can be found to replace the Interim Facilitator. + To move quickly, the fallback desicion process should be conducted offchain. For the first fallback vote, a list of volunteer Interim Facilitators and current active Facilitators is put up for one week. A simple majority vote on one candidate designates the Interim Facilitator. Should the first fallback vote underperform, then the same list is put to all currently active Facilitators, who choose to vote, on a shorter time frame. 48 hours is recommended.  - #### Budget Implementations Transitions + Regardless of which vote succeeds, the Interim Facilitator is approved on a short cycle and instantly assigned to that Core Unit. + The Interim Facilitator, once approved on a short cycle, is assigned to that Core Unit.  - Most importantly, this change involves transitioning control of the Budget Implementations that need to continue to run smoothly to pay out Core Unit's Contributors properly. How this is done in practice depends on the particular Budget Implementation. For example, it could involve using a multisig authority to change control of the Budget Implementation directly. Or propose an executive vote to the Weekly Governance Cycle. Or, in very time-sensitive cases (such as active embezzlement, Facilitator missing), an urgent/emergency executive vote that changes the control of the Budget Implementation, or another appropriate solution that works with the specific Budget Implementations. + If the candidate refuses the role, a member of a Governance Core Unit shall be appointed to fulfill the responsibilities of the Interim Facilitator.  #### Governance Powers   MIP41c5 Subproposal template + ### Powers for Unwinding Plan   + - Please link to the relevant unwinding plan MIP39c3 and the necessary minimum Powers a Facilitator or interim Facilitator must retain (see [MIP41c2](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP41/MIP41.md) to conduct unwinding. + Document how the ex-Facilitator will adjust, transfer, or discontinue ***any or some*** of the following: services, initiatives, assets, infrastructure, subscriptions, and contracts.*  ",

The compensation is set to be 33% of the annual salary of the Facilitator of the Core Unit that is being offboarded, as per its latest ratified budget.  This idea is suitable for CUs with public facilitator compensation like GovAlpha, but not all CUs have made this information public so we couldn\u2019t apply this universally. My suggestion is that you could use the GovAlpha framework set to Full-time, moderate experience from the most recent GovAlpha budget as a fallback for situations where outgoing facilitator compensation is not public - in the most recent budget, this would be 126,000 * 1/3 = 42,000 DAI, but I\u2019m open to alternative suggestions.

                    "content": "This post summarizes the main points of this subproposal from GovAlpha\u2019s perspective:  MIP40c3-SP15 is an amendment subproposal that affects the following MIPs, all of which belong to the Core Unit Framework MIP Set:  MIP38: DAO Primitives State MIP39: Core Unit Framework MIP41: Facilitator Framework   Despite its name, this amendment goes beyond \u201csimplify[ing] and [\u2026] clarify[ing] the Core Unit offboarding process\u201d. As stated by the author, this amendment intends to:  \u201cMake processes more transparent and orderly\u201d. \u201cFill in process gaps, or streamline them, with additional documentation and/or templates\u201d. \u201cInspire substantive discussion surrounding an offboarding proposal prior to a vote. It will also make tracking and editing Core Unit MIPs simpler\u201d.   Specifically, this amendment:  Redistributes some content within and across the Core Unit Framework MIP Set. Allows offboarding Core Units via a single MIP39c2. Currently, offboarding a Core Unit requires setting its budget to zero via a MIP40c4 subproposal and offboarding its Facilitators via a MIP41c5 subproposal prior to the effective offboarding. Modifies the offboarding subproposal template in an attempt to enrichen the process by making it more dialectical and constructive. Defines how unwinding compensation works and who is in charge of executing the unwinding. Attempts to integrate the rest of the MIP Set more deeply with the recently ratified MIP40: Budget Framework amendment.   For more resolution, please refer to @twblack88\u2019s changelogs in this thread. For even more resolution, please read through the amendment PR   This proposal has been assigned Medium-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  ",
