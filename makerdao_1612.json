The people that really care about the DAO are still here, not just for the speculative gains, but for the long-term vision. Hybrid crypto-backed vaults: Stacking coins The basic idea is to allow DAI borrowing by stacking ETH (Staked and unstaked) and wBTC into a single vault. Other potential combinations include stETH/ETH and wBTC/stETH.  Potential benefits include: more stable borrowing (<1 cross correlation between BTC/ETH aside from during drawdowns) and increased borrowing. Free-vault opening: Cover gas fees No-fee borrowing is pretty common in the real world nowadays as financial institutions have realized that giving up on \u201cfees\u201d at entry leads to longer-term benefits, in terms of net interest income. Gas fees have likely stopped a few from opening vaults in the past, and it would be great to hear from our growth/sales team if they have heard the same from prospects. This idea clicked recently, after joining Argent, I saw that the first crypto-purchase was fee free.  Screenshot_20220818-161930_Argent1080\u00d71037 129 KB  Governance Polls: DAI gas fees Not sure that under our current governance structure this is possible, but paying gas fees in DAI would be a great way to attract more organic DAI holders. I believe this has a lot of potential internally and huge potential externally, especially if we are able to implement the ETH/DAI gas fees for other governance token polls. A first step could be to be able to pay gas in DAI, but its really just converted from the ETH equivalent, and MKR in the backend converts the DAI to ETH. If polls allowed voters the option to pay in ETH or DAI (ETH equivalent), imagine the growth impact that this would have to our organic DAI. ",

TRUEMAKER:  but paying gas fees in DAI would be a great way to attract more organic DAI holders.   This I totally agree with.  I think humans have a mental model of preferring to pay in a stable value asset (DAI) than a variable value asset (ETH), because people that hold ETH might not want to sell because of potential value increases (even though there should be no difference rationally, because they can just convert between the two assets).

Sponsoring initiation fees for longer term value would be great publicity too. Current market conditions are ripe for this kind of proposal (i.e. Low Gwei). Realistically covering gas fees of 10 - 100 DAI would be recovered within a 2 to 4 weeks (assuming a 50k loan at 3.5%). I can confidently assume that average client loan life is longer than 1 month. If the collateral gets liquidated, the liquidation fees would more than cover it as well. ",

ACREinvest:  There can be more than one DAI core product as @psychonaut recently suggested on Discord to accomplish the very big vision for organic DAI growth.    To be clear, the tension that I was initially trying to address is that some community members want DAI only backed by trustless on-chain bearer assets like ETH, stETH, and rETH. However, there is obviously not enough demand for leveraging long these assets to create enough DAI. So we could have it both ways. We could split the system into OnChainDAI only backed by trustless on-chain bearer assets and then use a PSM to allow OnChainDAI to be deposited to generate regular DAI. DAI would wrap like an onion around OnChainDAI. There would be OnChainMKR that only protects OnChainDAI and another PSM that can generate MKR from OnChainMKR. It\u2019s not clear to me that splitting up the system like this is a good idea. It would nearly double the workload for PE or require the addition of an OnChainPE Core Unit to manage the OnChainDAI system. On the other hand, OnChainDAI would be easier to manage than DAI because it\u2019s a simpler, more limited system. It\u2019s not clear how the two surplus buffers should be managed. OnChainDAI should be isolated from DAI, but if there is a realized loss to OnChainDAI then it seems necessary for the DAI surplus buffer to recapitalize OnChainDAI. Splitting the system might also be a way to address the Tornado Cash debacle. Suppose regulators decide that DAI must have a way to lock and disable accounts. In theory, DAI could be redeployed with this ability, while OnChainDAI remains permissionless and uncensorable. Personally, I\u2019d rather both flavors of DAI remain permissionless and uncensorable, but if regulators told us that we cannot access RWA then we\u2019d be in a tough spot. So suppose we added an account disable capability to DAI. To account for the desirability of DAI over OnChainDAI, we could arrange for OnChainDAI to slowly lose value with a modest negative interest rate. Just spitballing here.   ",
