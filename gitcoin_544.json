So the basic idea is to move the whole quests saga into the NFT space. Each quest would be an ERC-721(or 1155) contract  where the questions(the actual question + the choices) together with the (encrypted) answers are stored in decentralized storage platforms like IPFS. Questions could also enjoy some freedom in what they are: text, sound, video, svg, \u2026 or a combination of them. Quests would then be deployed on chain and ready to be taken by people. Anyone could then take a quest and try her chance and if successful, she is awarded a token representing her accomplishment and as a bonus the contract could also award them some fungible stuff too. This way our quests would enjoy some degrees of openness + transparency and we could also expect unofficial UIs around them. You asked for decentralized UI but this is a clear backend hack but the though is raw and I look forward to hear your feedbacks. If I were to implement a mvp out of this I think 1-2 months is enough with 2 eths as compensation. Cheers, ",

                    "content": "I have put some thought (perhaps too much) about what I think the ideal quest system would look like (see below). While I don\u2019t know if something like this was intended as an answer, the content is relevant when thinking about the design/architecture of the new quest system, which is why I wanted to write it here anyways. Also, I hope this is the correct place to put it (Not sure if this is what was meant by the \u201cgov forum thread\u201d).  Definitions used  Governance entity: The entity, person, group of persons, smart contract, voting system or DAO that is responsible for managing quests Governance system: The system used by the Governance entity   Quest data storage I would suggest creating a smart contract that keeps track of the quest creator and references a JSON file containing the quest data via URL (for example using IPFS). This smart contract should have the following functions:  a public function for quest creation (new quests might start as a proposal before they are displayed to everyone) a function to accept a quest proposal (only callable by the governance entity) a function to edit the URL/IPFS hash should there be an error (should probably be callable by the governance entity and the quest creator, in the latter case it might make sense that the change must be accepted first) a function to remove a quest (only callable by the governance entity) a function to mark a quest as played by an address. This could be stored as a mapping(address => mapping(questID => Boolean)). (Only callable by the quest submission verification system) (optional) all ERC-721 methods (so that the owner can transfer ownership if he wants or even trade it).  The quest solution probably should not be stored in the quest data, as that would easily allow someone to cheat (a problem most decentralized solutions probably have). Additionally, there should be at least one entity running an IPFS node storing quest data (even if centralized), otherwise it might happen that quest data is lost at some point. Reasons:  Storing the quest (and ownership) in a smart contract provides Integrity, everyone can see any changes made and the history of all quests is stored (at least while the file is on IPFS) Storing the quest data/settings/config via IPFS means less data needs to be stored on chain. Everyone can access the quest data and it is stored decentralized. That way nobody can modify it unless they use the governance system. This is probably the simplest system to store quest ownership and data on the blockchain while allowing a governance entity to manage/filter the quests. Having all quest data available allows different systems / User Interfaces to use the quest system (as proposed below)   Quest evaluation This is probably the hardest part to decentralize without providing too many opportunities to cheat. I currently see two possible options:  Keep quest evaluation in the centralized codebase and share quest solutions between a subset of community members (part of and/or selected by the governance entity). If the centralized company is unable to verify correct results the data is at least not lost but still available. There should also be a (well documented) public repository allowing easy deployment of an alternative. To allow the switch it might be necessary to store the URL of the quest verifier in the smart contract. Use a system that can store secrets on the blockchain (or in a node that provides it to the smart contract). The user could submit his (encrypted) result to a smart contract that emits an Event for which a Node listens, who then checks if the answer is correct. Currently the only system doing something similar that I know of would be ChainLink, but I don\u2019t know much effort this would be to implement.  I do not know which solution would be better or easier to implement. The second one would probably be more resilient, as it is already decentralized. Nevertheless, only a limited amount of people should have access to the quest solutions. I would recommend to choose the first option but implement it in such a way that it is possible to switch if needed.  (optional) Centralized Cache Given the number of quests it might be worth storing a list of them (Name, Creator, \u2026) on a server or IPFS file, to reduce the number of requests the browser must send to display the Quest list. This should probably include the author profile pictures as they are currently quite slow to load.  Browsing Quests I would suggest keeping a list of quests, but make the following modifications:  Make the list sort-able (Client-side). Sometimes I only have 15min, so I\u2019m not yet interested in quests with 30min reading time. Remove the Description, Quest Owner and Stage columns and instead make a quest entry expand on click to show this information below the table entry. The \u201cInfo\u201d button never worked for me (it\u2019s probably better to display the entire text if you clicked on a quest entry) and when searching for a quest I\u2019m usually not immediately interested in the Quest Owner. Instead of the Stage column display if a quest has been beaten and how many attempts where made (I currently can\u2019t see the attempt number until I play the quest. The number of attempts could also be only displayed after expanding a quest entry. Make the search completely client-side to make it faster (as far as I can tell the information is already loaded in the browser on page load) Don\u2019t have anything below the Quest table, instead put it in another tab (even if the tab switch is completely on the client side). I don\u2019t think it is user friendly if you must scroll past a long list of quests to get to other parts of the application. (optional) Remove tabs and improve quest filtering. Perhaps some people don\u2019t care about how difficult a quest is because they want to get them all. Instead, I would suggest adding a show-only-beaten, show-only-attempted, show-only-new checkbox filter and do the same for difficulty. Ideally there would also be a min/max limit for the estimated play time. (In addition to the existing search option). If there are multiple quest types (as the current codebase seems to suggest) there should also be a filter option (or even a column) displaying what type of quest it is. Force all quest entries in the table to be of the same (pre-defined) height (if it\u2019s possible at least). This would prevent items from moving around while the page is loading (which was previously the case, I think)  Regarding Implementation, I would suggest building this part in Vue or React, then build it to static files and deliver it from the gitcoin server and/or from IPFS.  Playing a quest I do not have a proposal for changing how a quest is played, except for this:  First, everything related to the quest system should be well documented. This includes how to get quest data from the smart contract and IPFS, how to use the verification system to check if an answer is correct or not and where to get all the media files used by the current/official quest system (and referenced by the quest data). Quest creators should be able to add custom files (for example a custom background) by including the (IPFS) URL/Hash in the json file. This would allow more flexibility in the quest creation and the media files wouldn\u2019t have to be provided by gitcoin. (optional) It should be possible to create a second version of the quest system using the same quest data with the information provided by the documentation. This could, for example be using three.js to display Information or the quest environment in 3D but might be limiting which quests can be used. (optional) To achieve Modularity the player should be able to select which quest User Interface they want to use (for example someone with a slow PC might not want to display things in 3D). This could be done by having a selection in the quest list and a (cached) list of supported quests for each User Interface.  Similar to \u201cBrowsing Quests\u201d, this should probably be build into a static site and hosted on the gitcoin website and/or IPFS.  Winning & receiving a reward I do not have a good idea on how to improve this part, but here are my thoughts:  Personally, I like that you can get Kudos for playing a quest, but I find it a bit weird that multiple quests give the same Kudos, and it is rarely related to the Quest itself (for example \u201cRobot Found His Love\u201d has nothing to do with the quest \u201cJourney to IPFS\u201d, as far as I can tell). There are so many Kudos, that perhaps each quest should give a different one (though there are probably a thousand reasons otherwise). If someone can come up with a good ERC-20 reward, perhaps it can be combined with rewarding Kudos: You get the ERC-20 reward for all quests (maybe the amount is based on the difficulty and/or time estimate) and some quests additionally give a Kudos. Ideally one that fits the quest.  Regarding implementation of the reward(s): It is probably best to have a second smart contract with setQuestFinished-rights on the first smart contract that is called by the submission verifier (or the user with a valid signature of a verifier), gives the reward(s) and set\u2019s the quest to completed in a single transaction.  Open Questions (that I can think of)  How to keep the quest solution secret (see above for the Ideas I had) How to implement the time limit for questions and the attempt count. The player could receive the questions via HTTP from a server instead of them being publicly visible on the blockchain, but this would be a more centralized solution.   Please include I\u2019m currently studying IT-Security and have some experience in Solidity, Django, Vue3 and React. Mainly, I wanted to give my thoughts on the topic, but I\u2019m open to help building it, too (together with other people). Because I don\u2019t yet know how much time I have next semester, how many people would work on it or the exact scope, I obviously cannot give a timeline. ",

We\u2019re bridging game developers to Web 3.0 by building the open-source tools to make it as simple as possible for them to start integrating with the blockchain. We\u2019re calling these tools Game Legos: in the same way that Money Legos was able to bring about the DeFi renaissance, we feel these Game Legos will be instrumental in bringing about the coming NFT Game revolution. Game Legos are also perfectly in sync with the goals of this RFP. We\u2019re building them open-source and as simple, robust, and composable as we can.  What Is Your Proposal to Build This Same as our PFP proposal, we believe this should be built as a Game Lego on top of @austingriffith 's  scaffold-eth. We believe Scaffold-eth is not only the framework with the most solid foundation but is also the fastest way for developers to get started in Web 3.0. It also has a strong community of builders behind it that we could tap to continue improving the project. Creating a generic Quests component is very complicated, @DragonDev1906  has done a great job of breaking down an implementation. We\u2019re approaching it from the Game Lego perspective, where we\u2019re aiming for game developers to start using it for creating quests for their games and reward their players with on-chain assets. An example game with quests is shown below:  416\u00d7831 422 KB  The first version will focus only on the creation and completion of quests. We will create a form on top of scaffold-eth where game developers can create quests and save them on a smart contract. We will then have an example HTML5 game that players can play where they can login, see available quests and attempt the quest. Finally we will have a server backend that communicates with a smart contract that validates quest completion (at least until we can properly do this in a decentralized way). The backend is unfortunately centralized for now, similar to how quests are evaluated on current games. We can use an open-source multiplayer game server for this such as Nakama or Colyseus, which should have some battle-tested security checks against cheating. The multiplayer game server will then have a private key which can allow it to validate quests on the smart contract and send out the reward.  What Is Your Timeline To Build This We estimate this will take 2 months. There are a lot of moving parts though and there are still a lot of unknowns!  What Do You Need  Being able to consult with Quests development team, so we can more easily address any issues with migrating over the code and also write solid documentation OPGames can assign a team of developers on it for 10 ETH to build the initial version We\u2019d be interested in collaborating and exploring how to make the project sustainable even after the RFP  Thanks for reading, we\u2019re open to suggestions and comments!

                    "content": "Hi @owocki and everyone ! Introduction I am a full stack developer(4 years of professional exp and my hobbies are mainly focused around learning security, devops/infrastructure and sharing knowledge). I\u2019m also a user of Gitcoin quests. While I was really enjoying farming some Kudos and learning I noticed some problems that I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already aware of (dead links, limited to 1 ressource by quest, bypass of the timeout, flat view, etc.). My side projects were mostly focused on education so I though that expending on Gitcoin quests and combining it with open source & decentralized content could be a nice hack. That\u2019s why my awesome team mates and I have been working on a project called Discovery for 2 hackathons in a row (3 weeks each with a lot of research and brainstorm in between). What ? Discovery - a gamified learning platform where members of the official protocols team collaborate with content creators and researchers, developers or security experts to create high-quality courses that are built around open source trustable and verifiable content. Learners will be able to browse courses by topic or project name and at the end of a lesson they\u2019ll go through a quest (could be a simple quizz, a code challenge or an action such as \u201cparticipate to this hackathon\u201d or ie for a lesson about Ceramic & IDX, a quest could be \u201ccreate your DID and link it to your Github account\u201d) Here\u2019s the demo video and some images from the previous hackathon:  discovery-pathways2666\u00d71383 331 KB   unknown1725\u00d7975 126 KB  How ? We are using Gitbook to create content (like many other protocols), so we\u2019ve created a Github Action that can be plugged in any repo (Gitbook or code) and the files of the repo will be uploaded to FileCoin and IPFS through web3.storage. We then generate an NFT that contains metadata such as the IPFS urls/CIDs of the files of the repo, the name of the authors, the Github commit id, etc. We then upload that NFT to NFT.storage and we also create a Ceramic Document that contains the IFPS url/CID returned by NFT.storage. This will be used as a Token URI in our NFT Smart Contract, so the NFT will be dynamic and it will change every-time the content of the course is updated. The NFT representing the course will have variants (common, uncommon, epic, legendary) and we\u2019ll use Chainlink\u2019s VRF to randomly drop a common or legendary NFT to people completing the quest. We went for Ceramic and IDX as our main data & authentication layer (it handles relationships between records and structures our data model: learners, contributors, projects, courses, quests) For the quests, we are using Chainlink to make a GET request from our NFT SmartContract to our Ceramic Instance through an API Consumer contract in order to validate that the requester has the permission  to mint an NFT(quest completed & hasn\u2019t already minted his NFT). The answers of the questions are hashed and there is a server side rate limiter that keeps track of the attempts. When ? We\u2019ll probably need 4-6 months to get a decent alpha version, 3-4 months to make changes and improvements based on the feedback and then we can do an open beta release (so 7-10 months total) Needs ? On monday, I\u2019ve submitted my resignation ! I\u2019m done working for web2 private companies and I\u2019m going to start working full time on open source web3 projects. Discovery would be a great starting point so we\u2019ll need funding to pay:  UI/UX designers People deeply involved in web3 education, ideally with technical knowledge Front-end developers (ideally experienced with ThreeJS, that could create a view to explore the Web3 space in 3D but not required) Token engineers (interested in mechanism design and behavioral  incentives) More developers, security experts, dev ops (experienced in back-end & Solidity, decentralized storage solutions, etc) Members from Gitcoin to give feedback and to help us co-create the future of decentralized gamified education in Web3.

An ideal candidate would be have the following principles:  Simplicity - products that do ONE THING and do it WELL. Antifragility - Well-documented Decentralized products that our community can run without the centralized company. Modularity - products that easily unix-style interoperate with each other.  Gitcoin Holdings will provide a database backup of any centralized information (Kudos Images, metadata) needed to make a great Kudosexperience to a winning proposal. Would any of you be interested in developing a decentralized Kudos? If so please submit a proposal by September 15th 2021. Use cases to include in the proposal:  view kudos on marketplace send a kudos (xdai or mainnet)  Use cases that are NOT important for the first build out but could be built out later.  bulk airdrop of kudos view who else holds a Kudos indirect send of kudos new kudos creation form  Please include  Who are you What is your proposal to build this What is your timeline to build this What do you need (funding, etc)  Please submit your proposal as a comment on the gov forum thread.

First step would be to create the new smart contracts on the Rarible protocol. Next would be to test and migrate some of the current kudos to a testnet, perhaps redeploy the assets into decentralized storage, and then make sure they appear on all the supported marketplaces. Finally we can then create a sample UI on scaffold-eth for minting kudos and sending them to other wallets. An estimate would be about 1 month, barring any smart contract compatibility issues.  Enhancing the Kudos Experience We also have some ideas on how to improve adoption of Kudos which also address the future use cases.  Minting scripts should be created for not just xDAI but also other layer 2s to give minters the lowest cost options possible. An open-source widget should be created to allow builders to easily integrate Kudos into their games or apps, something similar to Opensea\u2019s Embed Collection Feature. We should also take a look at non Web-3 projects that have broad usage of kudos-like functionality, such as Reddit and Steam Awards, and create code to allow builders to quickly do this.  Perhaps something to allow us to give out Kudos here on Discourse?

Kudos \ud83c\udf89   6:47 PM - 9 Feb 2022           55                16             Team Kei  technical lead previously led engineering at early stage startup and before that worked as a software engineer on the blockchain division of a large tech company  Catherine  product lead previously product manager at a tech company that\u2019s deeply rooted in the future of work  Kathy  design lead member of VectorDAO and curates beautiful vibes at Kudos  We also have other part-time full-stack and frontend contributors on the team as well    What is your proposal to build this  We\u2019d like to start with the goal of doing product discovery to ultimately build out a custom user experience that\u2019s appropriate given common user journeys within the Gitcoin ecosystem. The solution we\u2019re proposing would reuse our Soulbound smart contract and various UI experiences to prompt a Kudos creation (both manual and automatic) upon things like bounty completion, quest completion, hackathon participation, and even grant contributions. We would also like to rebuild the Gitcoin profile view as well. The key here is that any Kudos you receive in Gitcoin should be presentable as part of your decentralized reputation in any context outside of Gitcoin. The non-transferability of the Kudos is a big plus when building proper decentralized reputation that shouldn\u2019t be traded or bought. By leveraging the smart contracts and our platform, this should be a win-win situation for everyone.  Our team currently has a working alpha version of these designs:   Figma \u2013 19 Dec 21    Figma Created with Figma       Completed functionalities include: creating a Kudos, specifying recipients, inputting information around the Kudos, claim link generation, profile view, and art generation (we have generic & branded backgrounds) Upcoming functionalities: peer-based verification/endorsements where teammates and community can vouch for a contribution, public APIs, more programmatic art generation (open to ideas!)  We strongly believe that our team and the Gitcoin community have a shared ethos of celebrating and capturing contributions in a decentralized world. We would love to share our learnings from our journey in building Kudos, and work together with the wonderful community to build out the best experience for the benefit of the entire ecosystem.   Timeline  We estimate about little over a quarter (~14-18 weeks) to perform product discovery, iterate on designs, and deliver the MVP.   2 weeks for team formation (we want to work on this in collaboration with GitcoinDAO contributors)  3 weeks of product discovery  1 week for interview script creation & recruiting user interview participants 1 week for conducting interviews and interview synthesis 1 for prioritization & roadmap creation + MVP definition    3 weeks to test and iterate on designs  1 week for brainstorming, creating low-fidelity designs, and user testing recruitment 1 week to user test, synthesize learnings 1 week to iterate on designs and prepare for engineering handoff    6-10 weeks to deliver on an MVP (rough estimate, highly dependent on output from product discovery)     What do we need   Funding to execute on product discovery & product design, then development. We have a small core team of contributors but would love to enlist community help! Examples of how we\u2019d enlist community help at this stage:  Co-create product discovery goals and questions Recruit users from the community to perform user interviews with Conduct user interviews Co-synthesize interview learnings + insights Decide on an MVP and roadmap Co-create designs via community feedback   Funding to develop the MVP. Again, we would love to enlist community help here as well to develop the MVP. Marketing, PR, and communications support from Gitcoin to share our collaboration & partnership goals Mentorship on running processes in a decentralized fashion  ",

I love the vision you (collectively) have for Kudos, and that you all are interested in advancing the project Gitcoin has had to put in maintenance mode. I am interested in other\u2019s opinions on the proposal, and I am highly supportive of us moving this forward and offering some space to form a workstream (like we did with dCompass). As for next steps, perhaps we can have you meet with a few other folks to share the ideas you have and learn more about we develop software, gather feedback and iterate. ",

Can you confirm that the MVP will be open source ? I also saw that you are founder of the mintKudos project, is there already a legal entity established for it ? If so, do you already have investors or do you plan to get funded by VCs or other type of funding? We can schedule a meeting if you prefer to discuss those topics privately. ",

Everything we build with Gitcoin will be fully open sourced and will take a community-centric approach to development.  I also saw that you are founder of the mintKudos project, is there already a legal entity established for it ? If so, do you already have investors or do you plan to get funded by VCs or other type of funding?  Yep, there is a legal entity behind the Mint Kudos project in the US. We are looking into multiple sources of funding, and happy to share more about it over a call. ",
