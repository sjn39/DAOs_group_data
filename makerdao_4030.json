Agenda Intro by @JuanJuan Presentation by Pep Ruckpanich (@Pep_Ruckpanich)  CapitalNow Cannabis \u2014 https://capitalnowcannabis.com  MIP6: [NCP01-DROP] MIP6 Application: European Point-of-Sales Consumer Finance Portfolio  CNC provides asset based financing to the cannabis industry; we specialize in account receivables financing/factoring and are adding equipment financing to our service offering. Traditional financial institutions and service providers have not offered their standard asset-based lending (ABL) services to the cannabis industry due to the inability of their current underwriting process to assess and mitigate risk   CNC mainly buys invoices issued by Licensed Producers (LPs) 1 to the Provincial Governments of Canada (B2G) at a discount. The provincial governments, which earn AA- to AA+ credit rating, and a few select larger and bank quality LPs have made it through underwriting and been approved as account debtors (B2B). New account debtors that have not received the same credit standing as the provincial boards and bank quality LPs have a credit limit placed on them as they work towards a more solid credit standing with CNC\u2019s internal credit rating system.

My name is Juan, and I am the facilitator for SES CU. Today we are joined by CapitalNow Cannabis and the Centrifuge team. We are going to be discussing their MIP6 application and anything that has to do with their company. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.

It resembles a little bit to the passion that comes from crypto, and it can resonate with your community. You mentioned that you monitor some of the bank accounts of the borrowers. Could you go over that? Also, there were 85000 loans made so far, and the default rate is less than 1% is that correct? 30:06 - Frank Cruz: To opponents of this industry, it shows that you have your hands on the businesses that these invoices pertain to. I think it is pretty cool, and I hope the rest of the community can see the same. You said that 85% of cannabis\u2019 sales go through the provincial boards, which is OCS. Have these 85000 invoices been through OCS, or this is something that can happen in the future? 34:20 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Do we know what is the volume to be expected in terms of Dai? How much is the expected DC for this Vault? How much could it generate? 36:32 - Payton Rose: How are you handling the currency risk from borrowing, Dai, and switching to Canadian dollars? 37:16 - Payton Rose: On a bigger picture level, what advantages do you see in seeking finance through Maker as opposed to traditional Canadian banking? 42:28 - Payton Rose: While the industry is certainly new, it is a crowded space. We have seen public companies struggling in the Canadian landscape just in terms of moving the retail. Backing equipment and things like that, it makes a lot of sense because you are safer. If someone gets pinched because they have a cash flow problem, given that you have a low amount of historical defaults, are there more details you can give us about the process you go through using  backstops for recovering funds? 47:04 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Where can people find out more about you and reach out?   Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 47:36  Thank you for coming over and presenting. Thank you to everyone else for joining.  Joshua Reynolds: You can reach out anytime at capitalnowcannabis.com. We are happy to take any questions that we can share with you. We are really excited about this opportunity. It is going to be a great enhancement if we can get everybody on board. This is something that you are all going to be very proud of in the future! Colin Cunningham: It has been a really fun journey for us here at Centrifuge to get to know the team at CapitalNow Cannabis. We have really grown together with our understanding of Defi, how important Maker is to this entire equation, and helping lift this industry in the ways that the CapitalNow Cannabis team has described today. Thank you, Frank and Payton. There is natural skepticism around the cannabis industry. Still, I  hope we can support the Maker community in understanding the importance of supporting businesses like this and financing opportunities like this. There is excitement leaving this call, and there are only a few of us on it. I hope we can find a way to vibrate out through the broader Maker community. Coming into this, there might have been more skepticism. Still, I hope you all have seen what makes this team, this company, and this opportunity so exciting for Centrifuge. We are excited to hopefully have Maker, and all of us be a part of this! Thank you to the CapitalNow Cannabis team and to the Maker community. Let us know how we can help to get the story out there!     Credits  Gala Guill\u00e9n produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
