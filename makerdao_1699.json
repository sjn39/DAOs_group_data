The original collateral onboarding process was not designed to accommodate the level of activity that is now occurring in Maker Governance, nor does it properly manage the risk of being overwhelmed with low-quality collateral onboarding proposals, which dominates and clogs up the current process. Continuation of the actual useful forms of collateral onboarding is already enabled entirely through the existing governance mandates and their ability to trigger relevant Executive Votes, as specified in MIP16, MIP39 and MIP41, but the Endgame Plan MIP Set also proposes additional amendments to further emphasize this existing capability and ensure that collateral onboarding can continue happening smoothly with no risk of unexpected blockers.   Removed MIPs This MIP removes the following MIPs and their subcomponents.

This MIP Removal Subproposal removes the following MIPs related to the collateral onboarding process: MIP6, MIP7, MIP8, MIP9, MIP11, and MIP12. This subproposal is an integral part of the Endgame Plan and the way it restructures the collateral onboarding process giving more autonomy over collateral onboarding to Facilitators. This structure is supported by three other subproposals of the Endgame plan MIP Set: MIP39c2-SP35, MIP39c2-SP36 and MIP39c2-SP37, that modify the mandates of RISK-001, SF-001, and CES-001 respectively. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  Disclaimer: These summaries are intended to be a guide and not a source of truth.
