                    "content": "Note: xToken has amended its original proposal to integrate community feedback, such as allocating rewards fully to Optimism, allocating rewards fully to WETH<>OP 0.3% pool, and extending the program from 10 weeks to 6 months (24 weeks). Along with the increase in duration, we increased the amount of incentivizes requested to ensure deep liquidity.  Project Name: xToken Terminal, Gamma Strategies, and Uniswap V3 Staker  Author Name: xToken Terminal and Gamma Strategies  Number of OP tokens requested: 900,000  L2 Recipient Address: 0x38138586AedB29B436eAB16105b09c317F5a79dd  Relevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)  xToken: $3.5M USD in TVL (Defi Llama) Gamma: $4.2M USD in TVL (Defi Llama)   Optimism alignment (up to 200-word explanation): The following is a joint proposal by xToken Terminal & Gamma Strategies to outline a path forward for OP liquidity incentives on Uniswap V3. This is an updated version of our June 2nd pre-proposal, which received strong community support. From that version, we\u2019ve reduced the amount of tokens requested \u2013 we recommend Optimism start with an initial 10-week program and then reassess continuation of the program. Terminal\u2019s out-of-the-box solution allows projects to deploy a highly configurable Uni V3 liquidity mining (LM) program in a matter of minutes, no dev work or technical expertise required. Terminal is live on Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon. Gamma has been actively managing liquidity on Uniswap V3 since March 2021 and prides itself on optimal LP strategies using its machine learning algorithms and automated strategies. Gamma is currently live on Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, and Polygon. The OP token is finally live, ushering in a new era for L2 Ethereum. For now, Optimism is the only leading ETH scaling solution with a liquid token. The OP token \u2013 which serves a focal role in the governance of the network \u2013 has already generated significant investor interest. As such, bootstrapping a strong, stable foundation of liquidity for the token is essential. While the token is trading on multiple CEXes, most DEX liquidity looks to be bootstrapped by independent actors and perhaps professional market makers. This is an undesirable state of affairs for a token, project and community with a commitment to transparency, decentralization and permissionlessness. We believe an OP liquidity mining program should be considered.  Proposal for token distribution: We propose a total allocation of 900,000 OP tokens for liquidity incentives, distributed evenly across three providers: xToken Terminal, Gamma Strategies, and UniswapV3Staker. After discussion with the Optimism community, we believe that 100% of incentives should be paid out on Optimism via the WETH<>OP 0.3% fee tier pool. Liquidity in this pair is most critical to the success of the Optimism token so we feel a full allocation is the best way to ensure adequate and sustained depth. For a detailed explanation of our analysis and initial design of the LM program, refer to our pre-proposal discussion.  How will the OP tokens be distributed? 900,000 OP tokens distributed to LPs over a period of 24 weeks:  ~33% allocated to each service provider\u2019s program 100% paid out on Optimism 100% to WETH<>OP 0.3% pool   How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? With three different service providers, each will be able to approach liquidity incentives and provision in a way that complements the other two, providing a robust incentives offering for all types of LPs.  xToken will provide a user-friendly interface for full range OP liquidity incentives, offering a passive option with lower IL and execution risk for community members who want a simpler LM experience. Gamma will actively manage OP liquidity, concentrating assets right around the spot price and structuring rewards through their platform. UniswapV3Staker will offer a more expressive, dynamic option for more sophisticated LPs looking to rebalance frequently and independently of other LPs.   Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? With a 24 week campaign, we\u2019ll be able to attract long-term users and capital from ETH mainnet and other chains. We believe that the user experience and emerging opportunities on the Optimism network will be enough to retain the majority of users after the incentives program ends. As we mentioned above, Optimism is uniquely positioned to obtain LP capital with its native token being first to market of the major L2s.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? Linearly over a period of 24 weeks.  How much will your project match in co-incentives? Due to their current emission allocations, it\u2019s unlikely xToken and Gamma Strategies would be able to match incentives for this program. ",

IMO directing any rewards to mainnet is a waste since there is no reasonable arbitrage vector given that all CEXs which support OP only support OP deposit/withdrawals on L2. More over, LPs would need to buy OP on L2, wait 7 days to bridge back to L1, and then add liquidity at a ratio which would likely have changed in that 7day period. Lastly, the ETH mainnet market is a much bigger and more whale oriented market, so 25% of 500K OP in rewards, simply will not do much to move the needle in terms of creating \u201caccess\u201d to OP since small buyers would prefer to buy OP on L2 (gas costs) and whales are not interested in buying OP from shallow mainnet pools (when the bulk of liquidity is sitting on L2 and CExs). I would support this proposal if 100% of incentives were targeted at L2. ",

Might as well concentrate everything towards one pool to have the greatest effect. I also think we should allocate everything to the WETH / OP 0.3% pool.  We get the greatest return on the OP incentives if everything is concentrated in one pool.  The WETH / USDC 0.05% pool is already pretty well funded, so if people wanted to trade from USDC to OP and vice versa, it wouldn\u2019t be too big of a deal to route through the WETH / USDC 0.05% pool which has good amount of liquidity anyways. I think the capital efficiency gains from having a really big WETH / OP pool will make up for the extra 0.05% fee by hopping through the WETH / USDC pool. This reasoning is also why I\u2019m against splitting these rewards also with Velodrome because it\u2019s again making it less capital efficient.  We get the most bang for the buck if all the rewards are directed to one pool.  That pool would be the WETH / OP 0.3% pool on Optimism.  But at the same time, I see that having a central point of failure is bad, so splitting among xToken, Gamma Strategies, and the Uni v3 Staker works for me given that all of the incentives given to these parties would contribute to the capital efficiency of one pool. Also 10 weeks is a bit extreme.  It should be more like 4-6 months. ",

We do have a few pools that we\u2019re managing on Mainnet that are being incentivized by our partner, H2OData, but for the most part it\u2019s all currently unincentivized.  You can see our TVL on the three chains that we\u2019re on here:  Gamma: TVL and stats - DefiLlama In terms of multichain, our TVL on Polygon has been slowly growing with the number of partnerships and pairs that we have opened up there.  None of that is currently incentivized either. On OP, we\u2019ve recently opened up there, so our TVL has stayed relatively stable thus far, but we have been making a push to actively get more TVL on Optimism.  We just recently passed a proposal on Frax Finance / Convex Finance to manage FPI-FRAX specifically on Optimism. That particular Frax gauge will be the first Frax gauge on Optimism which will incentivize Optimism LPs with FXS rewards.  https://twitter.com/GammaStrategies/status/1546480809275666432?s=20&t=W2W-wsTN_Y1MKb86pvhbUQ So we are optimistic (no pun intended) that our TVL will grow on Optimism even in the absence of OP rewards going forward.  Hope that answers your question.  Thanks! ",

The fact that the rewards are split amongst all three sources also mitigates a lot of risk given no single point of failure.  Additionally OP-WETH liquidity is something that is important to the Optimism ecosystem, so we should dedicate more to this particular trading pair.  Deeper liquidity here will result in a greater distribution of tokens as price impact comes down and we can ensure that there\u2019s more in-range liquidity. ",

The results ought to show themselves organically anyway, so it seems unclear that, as mentioned in the OP discord, a lower amount of funding would disadvantage you. Distributing across three strategies isn\u2019t risk mitigation by any stretch if one way or another we\u2019re still disposing of 900k - 10% of the entities\u2019 multichain TVL combined - in one clip without continued community oversight. If anything, this lends more cause to shorten the duration of the grant. We could try a 6-8-week time period, scaling the distribution down by time, and see for ourselves how well these offerings are working - and it ought to have a pretty immediate effect. And if some strategies are working better than others, we can collectively tune the grants to increase chances of everyone\u2019s success. There\u2019s absolutely no need to worry about shorter-term disruption of LPs; xToken Terminal and Gamma Strategies can simply reapply a few weeks before the end of rewards. That\u2019s the point of these highly phased distributions. It strikes me as likely that these offerings meet a need but unnecessary for us to deliver such a huge grant package up front. To preempt any claims of conflict: I mentioned here and in the OP discord that I\u2019m on the Velodrome team but value a strong Uni v3 environment as well as community-benefiting market making. I\u2019d also like to point out that in this thread I\u2019ve been supportive and dismissed someone else\u2019s suggestion to redirect incentives onto Velodrome. Following revelations about Perpetual Protocol\u2019s management of the OP grant, I\u2019ve decided that to increase participation I will begin to offer my private opinions about these proposals, always disclosing any potential conflicts.

On this part, I think it\u2019s just going to be 300K to each of xToken, Gamma Strategies, and the Uni v3 Staker.  That\u2019s around $219K in incentives for each, more or less?  I think xToken has 4M, Gamma has 5M TVL.  So that\u2019s < 5% of the their entire multichain TVL combined.  The other 300K OP is allocated to those using the Uni v3 Staker contract, so that\u2019s pretty much public LP funds.  I think having active management is good to ensure that at least a good portion is in range, as public LP funds may not always be in range, but do provide an additional safety buffer in decentralized liquidity. But there are certainly conflicts of interest here.  More incentivization to the Uniswap v3 pool would lead to higher liquidity in Uniswap v3 and lower price impact.  So when using a DEX aggregator, the trades are more likely to go thru Uniswap v3 as opposed to Velodrome. But from a  trader perspective, a dollar of liquidity goes much further on Uniswap v3 versus a constant product AMM like Velodrome in terms of lowering price impact on trades.  So I guess those are two tradeoffs to be making here. Do we favor having the lower price impact on trades via Uniswap?  OR do we favor having more DEXes service this pair at the expense of higher price impact on trades? I\u2019m more inclined with the former as I am a trader and an OP holder in that I would want incentives going to where they would have the greatest effect. ",

I think the math there isn\u2019t quite right.  With 900K OP incentives, you\u2019ll have 300K going to each xToken, Gamma, and the Uni v3 Staker.  So that\u2019s approximately $219k USD to each xToken and Gamma.  xToken has around $4M TVL, so that would equate to 5.4% of their TVL.  Gamma has around $5M TVL, so that would equate to around 4.3% of their TVL. Additionally, the remaining 300K OP tokens will be going to the LPs using the Uni v3 Staker contract.  So that would be split amongst all LPs who are using that contract.  I think that makes sense given that we do want a decent amount of in-range liquidity so it makes sense to have xToken and Gamma actively manage that.  But we also do want the safety buffer in terms of having the decentralized liquidity providers providing via the Uni v3 Staker contract. There certainly is a conflict of interest here as well because the more incentives that are allocated to Uniswap v3, the deeper the liquidity will be there, and the more trades will be routed to Uniswap v3 versus another AMM like Velodrome when using a DEX aggregator.  However, because Uniswap v3 is a concentrated liquidity AMM versus a constant product AMM, a dollar of liquidity will go much further in terms of lowering price impact on trades on Uniswap v3 than on Velodrome. So I guess the main question is do we value having deeper liquidity on Uniswap v3 as well as more bang for the buck in terms of OP incentives per effective liquidity?  Or do we value having a more OP-WETH trading activity take place on more AMMs? I\u2019m more inclined to say the former because the Uni v3 Staker contract does allow for decentralized liquidity without splitting the OP-WETH liquidity so many ways and causing more price impact than there could be.  Also as an OP holder myself, I would want the biggest bang per OP incentive.  For that reason, I\u2019m supportive of the 900K OP rewards split over 6 months. ",

I\u2019m all for proving out the thesis. Over less time, with less OP funds. If they demonstrate effectiveness, then by all means let\u2019s continue it. They\u2019re saying that people will bridge for their product and stay with it as an enduring eco benefit. Have they bridged for their product elsewhere (or here, for that matter)? Seems like not really. Why not demonstrate this conclusively over a shorter amount of time, confirming your thesis that we\u2019d see more liquidity and efficiency systemwide (to the detriment of my own interests, apparently)? There\u2019s no conflict here because, again, I\u2019m not saying they shouldn\u2019t get funds. I\u2019m saying they should get the same amount proportionately over less time. If what you say is true, then I should be arguing that the proposal is bad, that these people aren\u2019t providing value, and so on. This is a lot of money for an unproven thesis.

And only then, would I support this proposal.  If it were the case that all 900K tokens were going to solely xToken and Gamma, I would oppose it as well. Therefore, I think we should definitely make that extra clear in the final proposal that 300K goes to xToken, 300k goes to Gamma Strategies, and 300k goes to a separate account custodied by Optimism that will fund the Uni v3 Staker contract.

However, it comes down to how much extra value this adds, and the opportunity cost of the grant. Penn Blockchain has voted no, here\u2019s our reasoning why:  First concern was how much this proposal has changed over the last few days, and the seemingly \u201cuncertain-ness\u201d about the ask.  Whether it was the size of the $OP, the distribution of the grant (Mainnet included?, Velo or Uni?), just in the last few days it seems a bit all over the place. We have big respect for Jack Anorak and the Velo team. The last few comments and some deleted messages haven\u2019t instilled, once again, the highest confidence in \u201cthe ask.\u201d Although proposals have been formed in the past that don\u2019t have much quantitative data backing the ask, using that reasoning as a semi-validation for your proposal isn\u2019t the most confidence inspiring. The ask is pretty big\u2026 and if passed, may be the largest grant given to date. As unfortunate as it may be, the current state of DeFi might make this unluckily timed. For this sheer size of grant, and the pure amount of talent and coming through the pipeline, this huge amount might be better allocated elsewhere.  Overall, a lot of our concerns can be solved by just decreasing the ask size, and taking a few days/weeks to finalize the ask, sticking with it, and waiting a few weeks to maybe resubmit. Finally, we really appreciate the team reaching out regarding our no vote, and are continuously trying to express our opinions as much as possible. ",

Yet it\u2019s three projects partnering up to do a liquidity rewards program, which are notoriously expensive. These guys are competitors with each other and dropped that to make a proposal for OP that would give Optimism the best value. I think that deserves credit. There is no slush fund or dev development here.   @Juanbug criticizing the proposal for making adjustments on the duration and ask is not fair. Nobody has criticized the commitment, the preparation, the dedication, the tech. The only criticism in this thread has been \u201cchange the length\u201d and \u201cchange the amount\u201d. It\u2019s impossible to appease everyone realistically. Posts are asking this to be six weeks, and posts are asking it to be 6+ months.   I don\u2019t like what I\u2019m reading from @jackanorak. You made a simple claim that you want the proposal to be a trial period of 6-8 weeks to test and continue. That\u2019s a fair assessment, but it really should just have ended there. As a competitor, with a 3m OP proposal up and who received phase 0 funds, it looks like you\u2019re purposely trying to derail this proposal. Engaging in flame wars in this thread and calling the proposal \u201cdumb\u201d on the OP discord is not appropriate.   ",

There I also made continued appeals against the kind of zero-sum thinking entering into complaints like the above. I haven\u2019t engaged in flame wars - have only directly responded to others\u2019 questioning of my intentions. I invite readers to go through my posts and ask themselves if I\u2019m being in any way insulting. Whether Velodrome got a grant from the Foundation shouldn\u2019t enter into any conversations on the merits of this proposal. It was not something proposed to governance. It\u2019s not an advantage we enjoy over other protocols here. It was also the only fundraising we\u2019ve ever gotten, being a bootstrapped project, and every protocol and user here has benefited as a result, including Uniswap and the protocols making this ask. I don\u2019t understand how this new anon poster can on the one hand say with a straight face that the literal one thing I\u2019m requesting over and over again for an otherwise good proposal is reasonable and on the other hand say I\u2019m behaving inappropriately due to bias. It\u2019s a 900k OP grant, the largest yet for Phase 1, devoted to juicing a single pool for a year with no opportunity for OP to reassess. The number of projects asking for this is irrelevant, as is the fact that rewards would go to LPs (that\u2019s the case for virtually all liquidity mining projects, and there\u2019s always the question of who\u2019s providing the platform\u2019s LP). I am saying that we could just as easily offer the same package over less time to ensure that it\u2019s accomplishing the intended goals, which would absolutely help Optimism. I\u2019d like to ask xToken and Gamma Strategies, if they feel heavily disadvantaged here \u2014 how much money have they fundraised from VCs, and how much of their current TVL do they estimate is from those VCs? This question is highly relevant because the answer tells us whether they have a track record attracting organic TVL, whether they\u2019ve been able to use deposited funds efficiently (ie adding value), and why they won\u2019t match incentives.

One thing to note is that the end recipients of these rewards will all be public liquidity providers who either provide in accordance with the strategies provided by xToken or Gamma or in accordance with their own strategies via the Uni v3 Staker contract. To address @Juanbug 's issue of size, it\u2019s important to note that these rewards are split amongst 3 projects.  None of these rewards will be used to fund any sort of protocol development, pay salaries, or anything else.  For Gamma, all 300K will go into a MasterChef contract which will all get distributed to LPs.  For xToken, they will use their own staking contract to distribute all 300K of OP rewards to public LPs.  The remaining 300k OP tokens will again go strictly to public LPs who provide in accordance with their own ranges. So to address the issue of size, on a per project basis, this request here is quite low. With regards to whether this is too much incentives for one pool, I do agree with @cryptokitty that incentives for Uniswap v3 liquidity has much higher returns per cost of incentive due to the capital efficiency of the AMM.  $1 of incentives towards Uniswap v3 liquidity will lower price impact more than $1 of incentives going towards a constant product AMM, so if the theory is that more incentives go to where they will be put to the highest and best use, I think allocating more rewards over a longer timeframe to an OP Uniswap pool would be the right move in increasing the liquidity for OP, which will result in a wider distribution for governance and further decentralization. Speaking on behalf of Gamma, we have sourced all of our TVL organically without any incentives provided by us thus far mainly due to our strategies.  In terms of our strategies, we utilize automated rebalancing strategies as well as machine learning algorithms on certain pairs to mitigate against impermanent loss and optimize fee revenues. This occurs by setting rebalance triggers that automatically rebalance the price ranges in a new range when certain price targets are hit. Additionally, much of the liquidity that we manage currently is B2B liquidity via our partnerships with key players in the DeFi ecosystem. Our recently passed proposal with Frax Finance and Convex Finance will bring to Optimism, FPI/FRAX liquidity, which will be incentivized with FXS rewards. So we do believe we can bring significant value and TVL to Optimism without any further incentives.  The passed Frax proposal will be the first Frax gauge on Optimism, which is likely to bring in considerable TVL to Optimism as well that doesn\u2019t involve any OP incentives. ",

If it passes, I\u2019m sure liquidity on that pool will increase, which is a good thing. As a general matter I\u2019d like to point out that increasing the token ask along with the duration of the distribution does not make a proposal better \u2013 it increases the stakes of the grant and decreases the ability for governance to lend ongoing oversight and course-correct if necessary. This was the original issue I had with this proposal (I had no major objection before, to be clear), and I\u2019d like to encourage delegates to look past the high-level features in making their final determinations. For instance, I commend Byte Masons for lowering their ask along with decreasing the duration. This allows for more thoughtful review and staging of distributions. ",

However, I do think it is worth mentioning that risk assessment was a key factor in structuring the proposal the way that we did. We had originally intended on each service provider creating their own separate proposals.  However, we realized that having multiple sources of liquidity was important without any single point of failure.  So we wanted to avoid the outcome where it was just one provider distributing all the rewards according to their own strategy.  I think having two managers and the community via the Uni v3 Staker adds to decentralization and security of the OP liquidity, while also ensuring good active management around the current price. ",

Similarly, Gamma Strategies have gotten some remarkably high-profile investors, some of whom have a high likelihood of adding value through beefing up TVL metrics. Would love some more information on this.  OP distributions are for the funding of public goods; for some people these refer to benefits that otherwise go unfunded by the private sector. Again, this is not a knock on the current proposal, but I think all those voters who held their nose at the size of the ask - @polynya , @linda , @ceresstation - ought to take these issues into account going forward.

If they have, it\u2019s not coming from any of their official ENS accounts or wallet addresses, and it would have been without our knowledge.  However, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a likely scenario. More than half of our TVL to date have been sourced via partnerships with DAOs and protocols that we manage liquidity on behalf of.  These include Liquity, Ribbon Finance, Index Coop, Friends with Benefits DAO, etc.  We have made countless announcements on our Twitter page. The other portion has come from public LPs, mostly on Ethereum Mainnet and Polygon thus far; however, we are focused in growing Optimism at the moment, both from a partnership standpoint and public LP standpoint. The TVL that has been incentivized on our end came from partnering protocols such as H2OData.  But that makes up a minor portion of our overall TVL, and we do plan to keep partnering with protocols on Optimism that will incentivize pairs on Optimism.  This should work in favor of the Optimism ecosystem as liquidity incentives not from $OP are driving liquidity to Optimism. Hope that answers your questions. Thanks! Brian ",

That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t consider opportunity costs when considering well-resourced projects; we want to make sure OP goes toward proposals that offer outsized growth potential, and my belief is that, all else equal, less funded projects with traction have more to offer from active support, whereas better funded projects have a higher bar to demonstrate additional growth potential from even more funding. That we\u2019re still in growth mode lends all the more reason to ensure that the protocols seeking resourcing have demonstrated some clear ability to add value and grow the ecosystem, particularly if we are offering large sums with little followup. If they haven\u2019t shown traction, even with a lot of funding (which is a reason people cited in voting down Dope Wars), that weakens confidence in their growth potential. ",

If smaller projects add real value, cannot match incentives but distribute the Op funds in a meaningful way (not only internal development, own token liquidity, but for Optimism growth), this is a better use of Op funds than throwing match funding at large projects with their undifferentiated, short-term LM campaigns. That said, we haven\u2019t seen a top top Uni v3 liquidity management protocol and we would rather/also like to see funding for multiple cycles of 4-6 weeks to try different liquidity mining incentives (see early Balancer liquidity experiments); potentially even liquidity mining competitions and accompanying analytics of best user behavior - instead of 1, 2 bulk liquidity mining campaigns.

Project quality: Mid - 10M in joint TVL Team quality: Mid Amount requested: Mid - 300k per project for 6 months OP distribution: Reasonable - It\u2019s gonna be farmed to the ground but liqudity for OP token is important so I think it\u2019s acceptable. Furthermore, the LM program benefits Uniswap LPs not xToken or Gamma users, so again, I think it\u2019s fine. ",
