For other episodes of AMA, please check the forum.   AMA with Nadia Alvarez from Growth CU  Questions 00:25 - Jerry Goldfarb  How did you get to be the facilitator of the Growth Core Unit? What led you to this area of work?  03:26 - Jerry Goldfarb  Have there been drastic differences between the things you focus on or how you have to function in terms of now versus when you were with the Foundation? Or has it been just a continuation?  05:43 - Jerry Goldfarb  I had a connection with some of the members of the Foundation when I was working with CommDev. Through this transition, it has been interesting to continue to see all those relationships unfold into what we are now calling the community. What has your team\u2019s main focus been after this transition, and now that you are in the DAO and not the Foundation?  11:22 - Payton Rose  Now that a lot of Paxon\u2019s deals are more public, could you share about how that partnership came to be? What are some of the lessons you learned that Growth will apply to other partnerships as you look to grow on?  16:34 - Frank Cruz  I got a question with regards to institutional Vaults. I was listening to the Coinbase Earnings Call. They say that they have added 9000 institutional clients to their roster. Two of the biggest things that the institutional client is looking for are custodial services and making sure that they are compliant. I wanted to get an idea from you. When you talk to institutions, are you getting the same tone where they are thinking about compliance and custody? Can you give us a color of how that conversation goes when it comes to talking to institutions?  22:33 - Frank Cruz  Is the Growth CU talking more to institutions based in Europe, Asia? How about South America? Are you getting any traction? Do banks like Banco do Brasil or BBVA are interested in this product?  27:15 - Jerry Goldfarb  In terms of the conversations with these institutions, is it typical that they are like: \u201chere are the problems, this is why we cannot do it, if you figure out some answers to this come back to us\u201d or are they are more interested in trying to collaborate and trying to find solutions together?  28:34 - Jerry Goldfarb  I want to go back a little bit in terms of projects and things that the team with the Foundation, the Bussiness Development Team, did. Of the things already accomplished and finished, what are the most exciting things that are your favorite to share and discuss?  33:25 - Jerry Goldfarb  If you cannot convert the money, it is hard to convince people that it is worth something. That is a unique new frontier. When you start these types of conversations with a new company or protocol or something, do people respond typically positively and with a desire to collaborate, or is it a \u2018what can you do for us\u2019 situation? Is it easy?  37:10 - David Utrobin   What is the Growth CU doing to enter into other countries similar to Latin America in their general properties? What is the Growth CU doing to try to approach other geographies around the world?  40:20 - David Utrobin  Do you think that there is room for other Growth CUs that are also geographically focused but may have boots on the ground elsewhere and are more capable of approaching that area? Or do you think that the Growth teams should approach you guys and create a big Growth team? What should MakerDAO do to try to approach those other parts of the world that we might not be able to approach right now?  43:03 - Payton Rose (from chat)  Along the line of incorporating with Fiat, how is Growth looking at RWA opportunities? What are the most exciting ideas for getting Dai into the Real World?  46:38 - Jerry Goldfarb  Do you think that the process of the scaling and growth of the DAO is well defined so far? I think that the collateral onboarding process is not precisely straightforward if you just look at it. Once you have had it explained to you or can talk to someone about it, it makes sense. Do you think there is still a lot of improvement to be done in the crypto space of the onboarding process in general?  50:35 - Jerry Goldfarb This is a unique space that changes and grows so much. Right now, we have the impending regulations that are being discussed consistently. I wonder if you have a perspective on not seeing the gas fee problem coming. Have we paid enough attention to the regulatory conversations? Are we putting our eggs in the right baskets and trying to prepare as much as possible for the unknown of the impending regulations? Is there more we could be doing? 53:38 - David Utrobin  What is the number one thing that will help the impactfulness of the Growth CU?  57:04 - Jerry Goldfarb  If people want to reach out to contact you, what is the best way to do it?   Closing Comment  Jerry Goldfarb 57:30  Thank you so much for doing this, Nadia, and thank you to everyone for coming.   Outro 00:00  Credits   @gala produced this summary.
