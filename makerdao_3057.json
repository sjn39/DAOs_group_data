Motivation The DAO does not have a mandated Smart Contracts Facilitator, and as such we are currently reliant on the Maker Foundation for support. I believe it is in the interest of the protocol to have an autonomous Smart Contracts team outside of the Foundation. I believe I can fill this role as I have more or less been doing this with the organization of the PSM, DssGovRewards and other community-led projects. Work Credentials Work Experience:  MakerDAO Smart Contracts dev since August 2020 17 years software engineering experience CTO of Bellwood Studios Inc - a game development company Experience with web, games and broadcast television software  Relevant Information   Rocket Chat Account: @SamM   Github Account: @hexonaut   MakerDAO Forum Account: @hexonaut   Twitter Account: sgmacpherson [I don\u2019t tweet very often]  ",
