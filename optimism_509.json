They have agreed to contribute anonymized datasets and open source machine learning tools that will enable Optimism developers, researchers and data scientists in their efforts to use AI models for developing solutions for early detection and prevention of diseases.)  Is/will this project be open sourced?: Yes Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 5/15/2023 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?: Given its size and prominence, pharma and drug research organizations seeks to always be guarded against information security threats\u2014from both external and internal actors. This means that they are required to sift through billions of events generated by network devices, endpoint solutions, and enterprise software. Collecting and aggregating EHR is a complex activity for drug design, development. Further, there is a key need of collaboration between developers and subject matter experts, who can engage and design solutions collaboratively. The problem this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism eco-system is towards engaging developers to build collaborative solution along with doctors and public health care experts on Optimism blockchain utilizing Web3 eco-system tools, ZK proof systems, sharding and soul-bonding ID. Further, we wish to encourage developers to develop key procedures and practices on maintainability, unit testing and security of project code on Optimism blockchain. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: Our solution enables the bottom of pyramid and empowers the developer community through collaboration with radiology and research labs, pharma companies and the medical eco-system to do medicine trial testing and clinical trials via Ethereum and Optimism blockchain enabled EMTTRs (Electronic Medicine Trial and Test Records as a Service), EHR and Radiology services. EMTTRs on Optimism as a service aims at providing\u25a0Secure data storage, transparent data movement and data authenticity.\u25a0Improving Data Transparency in Drug Testing\u25a0Enabling healthcare community by empowering pharma companies & the medical eco-system to do medicine trial testing securely, transparently We will enable the developer community to share ideas collaboratively with medical experts via the builder events on Optimism, develop healthcare project blueprints and design, and organize information and content through videos, audio, images and blogs; engage non-profit organizations in innovation around healthcare and government agencies. We will invite them to localize and internationalize a Web3 developer library for electronic health records as a service to enable secure data storage, transparent data movement, and data authenticity via these builder events on Optimism: The model is based on the three \u2018C\u2019s of \u201ccollaboration, which is about working together at one place; community, when people work together, they form communities; and cooperation, which is essential for any particular project. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: We are engineering an eco-system for Optimism developers to build an Optimism NFT marketplace for DICOM images to enable research organizations and radiologists. This enables improving Data Transparency in Drug Testing and early-stage detection and prevention of community diseases and also enable the Optimism eco-system to impact the bottom of the pyramid via open source community contribution and incentives.We also wish to scale our efforts to develop secure, transparent Drug Testing Pipeline and improving Data Transparency in Drug Testing using OP stack.Our OP solution enables medical trial testing and clinical trials via EMTTRs (Electronic Medicine Trial and Test Records as a Service) and EHR and Radiology services on the decentralized cloud using OP Stack.We are also enabling the development for EHR as a service using OP stack for scaling collaboration of DICOM data in EMTTR. We will help to drive the growth of Optimism in a number of metrics:The number of Web3 developers and users onboarded to OptimismThe number of Web3 developers and users investing in OP and other health projects built on OptimismThe number of users utilizing medical services on OptimismIncrease in on-chain volume Developer Innovation in Optimism eco-system:  New policy designs and models to harvest tokens in a DAO-driven decentralize compute fabric. Decentralized NFT-based voting system for community contribution and development on OP Medicine. Optimism Workflow for engaging developers: Developers create a patch request for improving community tooling on OP Medicine (Optimism project); Developers can join that patch request by minting an NFT of that RFP. This NFT is created on Optimism.  Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No Number of OP tokens requested: 45000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: 0 How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): Wish to share that we will be awarding a $400 Linux laptop to the top contributors in our project. We will also be providing bootable educational pen drives on healthcare and medicine to our OP users. We have received 12 of such laptop devices and flash drives via grants from OLPC, Boston University and Sugar Labs. Further, we will share with them key research papers and articles authored by us to enable them to utilize our services collaboratively. The good developer proposals in OP medicine will be pre-incubated (in-house as well as virtually) and supported via funds and grants from NSUT IIF (NSUT IIF and Department of Design. - Student Glimpse). DTTE and AICTE in India will fund these proposals via the Yukti portal (https://yukti.mic.gov.in/) and SIH (https://www.aicte-india.org/Initiatives/smart-india-hackathon). How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): We will conduct four Optimism and open data science healthcare hackathons lasting 5 weeks each with a two week\u2019s break in between. We will also organize two Optimism bootcamps focused on its application towards healthcare DAOs and Optimism community tooling. We will utilize 90% of the grant in organizing these Optimism hackathons, Optimism bootcamps as they will enable us to develop a community of optimism users and open data science healthcare researchers, hackers, designers and developers. We have been judges at Smart India Hackathon 2019 to 2022 and have interacted with more than 900 healthcare professionals in the past. We will also collaborate with both public and private hospitals to enable anonymized data collection and collaboration on the development of personalized medicine. We are already collaborating with Rajshri hospital and medical college in India and wish to incentivize the patients, who volunteer to share their medical information in an anonymized manner (PyDICOM library anonymization) with OP tokens. We will utilize 5% of the grant in the above community outreach activity. We also wish to incentivize doctors and radiologists who contribute to our platform with OP tokens (20% of the supply). We will utilize 5% of the grant in the above activity. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: First 9 months (distribution of 90% of tokens): We will have four Optimism and open data science healthcare hackathons lasting 5 weeks each with a two week\u2019s break in between. We will also organize two Optimism bootcamps focused on its application towards healthcare DAOs and Optimism community tooling.

Technical: The medical row data file stored in IPFS would be encrypted or just anonymized and is the ID that is encrypted ( I suppose both). DNA data for instance is simple to compare between anyone, but some other data depend on some standards, calibration, etc. Radiological image is working well using AI algorithms, Is it easy to find a standard way of coding it in this case? I guess it\u2019s not the same in a simple Rx in some other cases like flow cytometry, RMI, FMRI, evoking potential, etc. It may depend on some standards on the device, reactivates, calibration, and especially people performing the test.   Legal: I suppose the project has Indian regulations, and that\u2019s a huge deal for the size of the country. It could be a game changer in medical research. How do you see this for other regulations like USA or EEUU?   Optimism: optimism\u2019s view is open-sourced and let\u2019s hope we finally get ways to incentivize governance collaboration vs competition. Are you or will you contact other projects around the ecosystem or even merge and join with them in a fair way if necessary? Thinking in the DeScience community projects working on technical solutions for ZK proof systems, sharding, soul-bonding ID (imagine losing access to your medical Data), etc.   I very much hope OP collective has the resources to evaluate properly you\u2019re proposal and we don\u2019t let go of people like your team from this community.

Wish to share our thoughts/ response on each of the vital key points shared in the feedback:   Technical: Anonymization and authorization for radiological data including X Rays, CT Scan, MRI images and Nuclear medicine can be achieved following standard methods of coding using PyDICOM open source library. We did try this for a variety of X Ray and other radiological images and accomplished it for hospitals in Noida (India), Greece and an NHS hospital (UK). We also have similar standard methods for anonymizing DNA data using open source software. We will commit the scripts that we wrote in Python for not only anonymizing the radiological data but also automating the process. We will update on this thread soon and will appreciate your feedback on it.   Legal: Wish to share that we have reasonable experience collaborating with organizations, who work with NHS and NIH. As guided by them, there are some very key principles and goals we need to follow before accessing and working with medical data of any kind. Example: DICOM radiology data comprises of both image and patient meta data. So, for any modality, we need to arrive at a set of parameters for anonymizing and encrypting the data before sharing it for medical research. There are key guidelines on taking consent from the patient and also sharing about CRO\u2019s interests on using the data for medical research. Till now, we have also accomplished data collection, anonymization and storage by collaborating with medical colleges and research institutions. It has been easier for us to focus on improving the state of art in reference to IT, machine learning, decentralization and networking aspects while our pilot partners and organizations take care of the legal aspects. We appreciate your feedback and will keep you posted on the developments on this aspect as well.   We are more than happy to collaborate, learn and even merge with other eco-system projects if that helps the community and medical research family. DeScience community projects are a great place for us to learn, educate and improve our technical solution. Great community indeed and we will definitely look for technical solutions for ZK proof systems, sharding, soul bonding ID and even integrating with proxy re-encryption solutions using Optimism for scaling. Thank you so much once again.   ",
