Are these tokens for all intents and purposes burned or are these tokens also in ownership of the DAO as it owns the address? https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f8F72aA9304c8B593d555F12eF6589cC3A579A2  I understand there is a transfer function within the smart contract however I am not knowledgeable enough to know that functions limitations.
