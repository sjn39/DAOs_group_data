Summary In July I created a signal request to add ETH-B as a new vault type. The reasoning for this was to give vault users another option to create more DAI for a higher stability fee. That poll concluded with the community signalling for our risk team to advise on these new parameters. Now that that has finally been completed we can finally move onto creating it ourselves. Therefore: Should we create an ETH-B vault type?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     If \u201cYes\u201d, What should the Liquidation Ratio be?     145% 140% 135% 130% 125% Abstain     0 voters     If \u201cYes\u201d, What should the Risk Premium be?     4% 6% 8% 10% 12% Abstain     0 voters     If \u201cYes\u201d, What should the starting Debt Ceiling be?     5 Million 10 Million 15 Million 20 Million Abstain     0 voters     Polling will last until 2020-10-05T04:00:00Z. Please choose all options you agree with. I look forward to your discussion and participation! Next Steps If passed: Polling ends October 5th, Pull Request October 7th, On-Chain Poll October 12th, Executive October 16th. If governance wants to speed up this process, consensus must be reached by September 30th. @LongForWisdom can make a call on this based on past precedent. ",

Now we are starting to learn that ETH is riskier than USDC (even though we have no way to liquidate USDC and the black swan event in USDC would be much more devatstating than in ETH) and that it should bear higher and higher SF. If there is a niche for this product (125%/+4%) then there is also a market for 130%/+3%, 120%/5%\u2026 The whole system looks like a mess where a handful of people votes and one whale decides. Charging high stability fees while the peg is artificially glued to $1.01 using USDC screams: take profit while you can. I noticed on Twitter that there is more and more complaints/comments from respectable ETH users including Vitalik Buterin about the stablecoin dependance and the road MakerDAO is taking since the Black Thursday. We should start listening to those voices. My suggestion is to stop raising the DC for stablecoins and think about the ways to stimulate minting DAI from decentralized assets like ETH, Uniswap ETH/DAI\u2026 ",

In this type of scenario stability fees and borrowing demand are relatively inelastic. It\u2019s not about cashing in for short-term profits, it\u2019s about looking at what the protocol needs to take the next step in its evolution. The protocol needs to scale by onboarding dozens more collateral types in a rapid manner. At the same time the protocol needs to become more decentralized and ween of dependency on the Foundation. Raising the stability fees allows the protocol to build up a treasury which it can use to fund grants for onboarding additional independent domain teams which will scale up collateral onboarding throughput and ultimately Dai supply. To that end, I think an ETH-B vault is a great idea. We capture a segment of the market looking to take on more leverage that has traditionally been alienated to other protocols like dYdX and Compound. Of course increased leverage also means more risk so the debt ceiling will have to be carefully managed. ",

Answer: No. The DAI from my Vault are producing ~14.5% APY on Yearn, so having a BAT cdp is still profitable. Conclusion: I agree with @NikKunkel . Despite my very limited DeFi skills (I am not constantly scanning the web for the best yields available) I can still make profit with the current SF. Surely more sophisticated investors can do that too and much more. ",
