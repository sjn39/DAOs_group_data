Micah Zoltu @MicahZoltu 02:05 So many people hating on the name of this thing.  Thomas Jay Rush @tjayrush 07:18 Should be\u201dBerlin Inclusion\u201d. I can see the headlines now. \u201cMagicians\u2019s Council meets at Berlin. Only 100 Allowed In.\u201d Stop calling it a council! Nick Johnson @Arachnid 08:09 \u201cWorkshop\u201d and \u201cWorking group\u201d both sound better than \u201cCouncil\u201d to me Or just \u201cMeeting\u201d Jamie Pitts @jpitts 08:59 Interesting, @arachnid what do you think is wrong with it? I have my own opinions but don\u2019t want to bias yours Nick Johnson @Arachnid 09:01 It just sounds a bit exclusionary and far more \u2018official\u2019 than it really is. Councils have closed memberships. It also sounds pretty pretentious. Like \u201cthe Tokyo accords\u201d or \u201cthe Geneva convention\u201d Jamie Pitts @jpitts 09:03 LOL. ok that is good feedback. The Magicians metaphor can go too far and communicate the wrong intention.  So if you feel that \u201cCouncil\u201d as a term is just not right for what this set of meetings will embody, say that here. And declare an alternative as well. ",

What I do believe, is that the message has not been clear enough that EVERYONE can join these meetings. I tried to clarify in my blogpost, and got some interesting questions around. I believe that if we can reinforce blogposts, invitations, share them on Reddit (always ask as I got enough karma), and etc. we can raise awareness on this.
