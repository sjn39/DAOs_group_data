For certain trade routes, GeTS have visibility and control of the entire supply chain. GeTS achieves this with its service coverage and strategic port partnerships. Applicants Shuttle One Pte Ltd Lim HongZhuang CEO Keith Steven Muljadi Board Non-Executive Director  2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token  CALISTA\u2122 powered by ShuttleOne Bringing together both digital logistics prowess of GeTS\u2019 flagship product CALISTA and ShuttleOne\u2019s ecosystem, ShuttleOne\u2019s defi infrastructure supports CALISTA Finance by way of financial risk management in a A.I powered credit scoring for the financial and business viability of merchants in the supply chain with financial data. ShuttleOne maps the fiscal health of the merchant applying for a loan alongside port operations data to get a complete picture of the business viability of these merchants in asset based cargo movements utilizing a mix of NFT and ERC20 Tokens that provides onchain and offchain management of trade financing and operational oversight. Merchants are able to apply for a loan anywhere globally where GeTS has port and custom linkages. So far, CALISTA Finance powered by ShuttleOne has serviced more than 30 over merchants in 2020 within Southeast Asia and China in over US$300,000 of trade financing. Port Operators can verify goods\u2019 and trades\u2019 legitimacy (i.e physical checks on cargo in storage awaiting shipping). This is achieved by strategic partnerships with port operators globally. The data GeTS possesses provides oversight of cargo movement and powers financing decisions. Financiers have greater confidence to finance trades that they have sight over. Trade data is also used within financier\u2019s credit assessments. This provides them with a deeper understanding of borrowers from not only financial data but also alternative operational data. This sharpens their risk management of credit disbursement. CALISTA Insights also provides trade-related data to empower lending decisions. On-Chain Risk Assesment: Risk Assessment Token (RAT, ERC721) During the process of risk assessment and verification of cargo, ShuttleOne captures basic merchant information and tokenizes the merchants\u2019 financial data and port operational data into a non-fungible token in RAT. RAT tokens data are stored on chain and can be easily verified by parties within the supply chain logistics platform from operations to finance.  Data Captured: Master Bill of Laden Customs Declaration Packing List Agent Agreement Buyer/Seller Details Invoice of Cargo Other Logistics Operational Data  Compliance in Finance   Credit Model Methodology Standard Scorecard The hypothesis of the credit risk weighted model is as follows:   At any given random day towards maturity, the borrower has predicted ability to repay the trade financing   The methodology is a statistical model to predict quality outcomes of   a. Default b. No-Default  Operational Data combined with Credit assessment of merchant provides an all round analysis of fiscal performance of credit and scoring  Let be the probability that the event occurring where , the the odd ration can be defined as Odds= p/(1-p) Therefore, the credit risk weighted model is as follows: log\u2061(Odds)=\u03b20+\u03b2_1 x_1+\u22ef+ \u03b2nxn The Weighted Evidence (WE) is utilized by applying operational data correlation using the Kolomogorov Smirnov (K-S) as a performance measure against standard deviation of the calculated parameters given a coefficient for confidence that risk governance will decide over a given period of time. Thereafter, the score card can be calculated with the following: Score=A-B*log\u2061(Odds) Score=(A-B* \u03b20+\u2211(-WEi *\u03b2_i) Where  \u0392 -operational data regression coefficient of data attributes \u03b20-operational data regression intercept WE-Weight of Evidence value for the given operational data  Operational Data is collected via platforms of operational partners where correlations between operational data of merchants are scored alongside standard deviation of cash flow analysis and weighted into a score percentage of a maximum of 1000 basepoints as a form of risk management combining not only credit cashflow analysis but also operational data of merchant in assessment for risk. Aside from financial data and port operational data utilized for risk assessment, ShuttleOne also ensures process control and assessment to compliment these on-chain assessments as described below under Section 8. The Applying Collateral: Credit Application Token (CAT, ERC20) Merchants\u2019 data as risk assessed above are thereafter issued CAT token(s) according to the invoice of cargo requesting for credit. The applying collateral is the Credit Application Token (CAT).

Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  The collateral\u2019s responsibility resides and is reinforced in the countries that the borrowers reside in. Typically these are B2B merchants applying for a loan in their local jurisdiction(s). To work with cross border trade financing, ShuttleOne has signed agreements and operational partnerships with the relevant port operators to confiscate collateral for and begin liquidation should there be a case of default. The Off Chain to On Chain Overview is as follows:  The off chain legality of control resides in a partnership with the Collateral Manager (port operators) and ShuttleOne. The Collateral Manager assumes the role to confiscate goods and liquidate should there be a default.  9. Where does exchange for the asset occur?  The exchange of the asset occurs within the dex of ShuttleOne (between funders and borrowers).  10.

                    "content": "Thanks Meltem for these questions. I shall break down your questions to the following categories: 1. Legal Jurisdiction on Liquidation of Asset/Collateral & The Debt Collection Process As ShuttleOne is a Singapore based company. Should the borrower reside in Singapore\u2019s jurisdiction. It is fairly straightforward in terms of legality to pursue the borrower in a case of a default. We\u2019ve partners that deals in these process of debt collection in a compliant and legal manner. Should the Merchant resides in cross border jurisdictions, Singapore\u2019s court of arbritration has been the center of more international disputes. However, we have showcased that these are actually last resorts should we need to go to the arbritration courts. We believe our innovations in processes allow us to risk manage and debt collect easier. However when it comes to cross border jurisdictions, the legal process becomes a bit more tricky. Traditionally, the fragments in legacy finance causes this gap in financing. For example, a bank that is domiciled in Singapore usually do not entertain loans that originate from outside the country unless they have subsidiaries. Which generally in terms of such cross border trade financing, it is the work of investment banks (for e.g JP Morgan), but truly how many SMEs can be clients of JPM. How ShuttleOne tackles this tricky scenario is a partnership we\u2019ve signed with global port operators. In our diagram above and i will pull it up here again this is the role of what we call the Collateral Manager.  On the Master Bill of Lading, should the cargo be the asset that is backing the trade finance, ShuttleOne and/or the Collateral Manager becomes the Consignee of the cargo. Which means to say, we are legally able to instruct the port to hold, release or confiscate the cargo upon a case of a default at any port of call/destination. This gives ShuttleOne and our partners onchain and offchain oversights of the cargo in transit and more importantly a relative risk reduced loan in cross border trade financing. Generally, the Collateral Managers are customs or port operators. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality agreements I am unable to represent these publicly. I do beg the community\u2019s pardon for this. 2. The price discovery of the assets regarding Cargo in default In all our trade financing that we\u2019ve done in the past 4 months, the borrower is needed to pay a 30% downpayment to the Collateral Manager and ShuttleOne and our funders will therefore facilitate 70% of the collateral value. This almost mimicks the ratio of collateralization in the Maker Protocols at this moment. This is a process and technological process internally when loans are applied for. This again, is not a process norm usually. Either the seller or the cargo gives 100% credit (in terms of cerdit terms) or the buyer needs to fund the cargo 100% BEFORE the cargo is delivered. Or what the industry terms will have it as \u201cpayment on sight of Bill of Lading\u201d. Unless of course, you are a JP Morgan client. This becomes another financing gap/opportunity. SMEs before the pandemic already faces such a funding gap. What this means is that, should there be a default, the cargo (which ShuttleOne/Collateral Managers have control over till release upon payment) is financing the asset at a 30% haircut. Reducing the risk of such cross border financing value. Scenario Analysis: Price of Cargo: $100 Downpayment from Buyer: $30 Loan to Value: $70 In a case of default, we are able to sell the cargo within a band of $100 to $70 and the possibilities of recovering 100% of the LTV is high, we will not be able to provide any guarantees to the 1:1 ratio for CAT/DAI and it will be at a \u201cbest case\u201d basis and liquidators/keepers vary from cargo to cargo. In summary, game theory will have it that if the merchant wants his cargo release, he pays up. ",

                    "content": "**Will DeFi be the key to build platforms into its own economy? ** As ShuttleOne ecosystem grow into servicing global trade platform like CALISTA Finance. We see the potential for ecosystems like B2B and B2C platforms to grow and build their own financial services to service their users. In platforms where capital or cashflow could be an issue for acquisition. Building their own financing infrastructure ensures more successful deals for platforms As ecosystems grow, one of the biggest challenge to acquire more successful deals within the marketplace or between users and the service provider will be financial solutions. When a client faces difficulty in paying or getting credit for the payment, the successful rate will fall. For services that require a bigger amount of capital or cash flow, users need to find solutions outside of the marketplace, like looking for government grants or bank loans. Sometimes, if the issue needs complicated solutions to solve, the deal mostly falls through. E-commerce platforms are the master of increasing the platforms success rate. Their check out processes are purposely made so fast and easy, so customers don\u2019t have a lot of time to rethink their decision. DeFi has unlocked the door for fast and easy financing service where anyone can access a loan within 10 minutes. What if DeFi can be integrated into platforms as payment or loans? In Asia, we call platforms that build and provide their own financial services to their ecosystems \u201csuper apps\u201d. Looking at the successful cases of \u201csuper app\u201d, Wechat and Alibaba in China, or Grab and Gojek in South East Asia, we can find a common theme: the key to make an app become highly recurring and extremely useful for their users is to remove the rigid payment through seamless solutions**.** If you go to any Chinese consumer target stores, the most popular payment methods are Alipay and Wechat. Grab is also trying to push GrabPay as a standard payment method in Southeast Asia markets. Super apps also can take a step further and remove the cashflow hurdle for its users by offering loans and credit. In China, Alipay and Wechat dominate the market, the applications also offer microloans to its users to borrow small amounts to pay for food delivery or hotel booking on its apps. DeFi will be the key for platform-owned financing service  Solving the payment issue  Gojek, an Indonesia ride-hailing startup faces the payment issue when they intend to expand their services to various markets. Users in one market cannot seamlessly pay for the service when travelling to another country. The reason for this difficulty is the fragmentation of payment services in Asia. Unless using regional payment platforms, Gojek needs to onboard a local remittance vendor for each market. Blockchain remittance is a financial solution that removes the rigidness in relying on central systems, exchanges or banks for payment. Instead of relying on its own resources to build a payment network, applications can adapt blockchain payment, like using DAI stablecoin as payment. It is secure, fast, low fee and innovative for cross-border payments, especially for platforms servicing in multiple markets.  Solving the cash flow issue  Advance, credit or loans are well-known methods to acquire a paying client. The decision-making process is one step faster for the client when they do not need to worry about coming up with the money at the time of purchase. That is why credit cards are a widely popular payment method for consumer applications. However, not all clients can get access to financial services. There are almost 80% of consumers and 65% of SMEs businesses are not getting access to financial services such as loans and credit. Decentralized finance (DeFi), a solution implementing blockchain technology, solves this issue by removing the gatekeepers and middlemen and connecting the ones in need of borrowing directly with the ones with capital power, using unbiased credit scoring and digital currencies as liquidity. ShuttleOne, using DeFi infrastructure, evaluate platforms data to assess credit score and build a sustainable risk and liquidation process based on the ecosystem. In global trade ecosystems, like GeTS, ShuttleOne can offers trade financing service by evaluating the trade invoices and commodities that can be collaterized for trade deals in wholesale, retail, e-commerce, transportation, etc. For default risk mitigation, ShuttleOne works with PSA (Port of Authority of Singapore) to control the moving cargo between ports and liquidate the asset in case of a default. Keep in mind that different ecosystems and industries will have different set of data and method to assess credit and mitigate risk. With blockchain, it is now possible for ecosystems to integrate  data into smart contracts and create their financing services using DeFi methodology. ShuttleOne bridge DeFi to platforms economies Speaking of that infrastructure, ShuttleOne is bridging ecosystems with decentralized finance resources. As an operating financial system enabling users to utilize platform data, the door is opened for platforms to provide their own financial services under the ShuttleOne umbrella. The option to extend such financial services to customers creates a more compelling ecosystem and ensures customers don\u2019t have to look elsewhere. Keeping that in mind, the economic potential of ShuttleOne becomes more outspoken. Any investor lending liquidity to this protocol will be exposed to the potential of having major companies launching their own financial services. Currently, ShuttleOne is integrated with GeTS, a B2B global trade ecosystem that is servicing global trade businesses in 60+ countries. We estimate there are $58 million USD worth of trade financing that we can support within this economy. When ShuttleOne infrastructure is plugged into an ecosystem, we are immediately exposed to its existing economy and grow our user base exponentially. The question is: How do we increase enough liquidity to service these ecosystems. Tam: Hey guys, this is my most recent article on DeFi implementation into real-world. The article is written by me based on ShuttleOne\u2019s approach in bridging DeFi to the real world and is featured on Thefintechtimes. We thought this is something that the Maker community will appreciate Let us know your thoughts on this methodology and would love to pick your brains on this topic. ",
