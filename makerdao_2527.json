I know this is, and will probably always be, a contentious topic but I know a portion of the community is open to this idea and is worth exploring if it can be done properly. Here are some pros and cons that I can think of. I look forward to adding more as the community weighs in. If the poll gains traction I can take it to the next steps. Pros:  High market cap collateral option Takes MKR away from secondary lending platforms Positive price impact during \u201cgood\u201d times  Cons:  MKR in vaults is MKR not voting During market downturns, MKR vaults could contribute to death spirals (price drops so MKR vaults have to sell to cover liquidation so price drops more, etc.) Moral Hazard and Emergency Shutdown  Should we consider adding MKR as collateral?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     This poll will run for 1 week to provide ample discussion if necessary and not too long in case there is any traction. If you can think of any other pros/cons I will be sure to add them to the overview. Looking forward to hearing the communities thoughts on the matter! ",

If this gains traction it would elicit the creation of a MIP6 for MKR. @Jtathmann I agree that in the past that may have been true for SNX, but they are in the process of adding other collateral options as well (ETH). Since MakerDAO already is primarily backed by ETH I think that if we were able to choose a pragmatic debt ceiling and liquidation ratio that never allowed MKR to be more than a certain percentage of total debt then we would be find. The crux would be making sure that years down the line governance didn\u2019t slowly creep the total allowed debt ratio higher and higher out of complacency since we already opened pandoras box. Unfortunately I think MKR being added will always be on the table and is inevitable. As long as we always have good stewards of the system we would be safe but alas, as time stretches to infinity the possibility of this outcome taking place nears 100%. ",
