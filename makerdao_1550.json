Realize Maker has already eaten about 2/3 of the loss here and what is left is 2/3+.13(iquidation fee) =.79 or no more than 21% of the total.  The reason is that vault holders were already paid 2/3 ETH liquidation value in DAI as the loan on their collateral.

While it does require discussion, that discussion should take place in a durable medium on the forums. I\u2019m wary about having a call specifically for Vault Holders to air their grievances (which is what I believe such a call would turn into.) I think it\u2019s fairly likely that such a call would end badly. Realistically what we need to make a decision on this is a verifiable list of losses (that I\u2019ve described elsewhere.) By verifiable I mean that someone needs to be able to run a script or something to regenerate the data from the block-chain so that we can be sure that it\u2019s accurate and complete. Once we have that we can start having an informed discussion about compensating people. From what I can tell, your voices are being heard. The discussion has been opened. Is there something specifically about the current response that you are unhappy about? ",

Those Vault losses I presented are not truly representative for compensation purposes. Vault loss that I calculated also includes a penalty fee and ETH price decrease during auction time for particular vault. For compensation calcs, you need to exclude those two effects plus of course assume how high bids would be during that time. Finding a decent benchmark to compare to is going to involve a lot of bias though, because we haven\u2019t had such high liquidation volume event in the past, accompanied by lowest DAI liquidity and highest ETH volatility seen during Maker existence.
