                    "content": "In this post I will try to provide some more detail on how the Scopes are supposed to work in the Endgame. Initially the first version will just focus on the theoretical functioning of the long term status quo. Then following from that, the same diagram approach can be used to describe intermediate transition states. Overall in the Endgame there are three broad categories of actors. The Scopes are closest to Maker Core, the MetaDAOs are semi-independent DAOs, while Ecosystem actors are completely independent companies, individuals or DAOs that work for Maker Core or the MetaDAOs. The Scopes detail how interactions between Maker Core and MetaDAOs and Ecosystem Actors occur, and for what reasons. The goal is that the Scopes help maintain the key characteristic of immutability that is crucial to the Endgame and Maker\u2019s long term survival. There are 11 Scopes in total, and together they cover all possible complexity and interactions that Maker Core can engage in, and provides as much detail and framework as possible for how such engagement occurs. The 11 Scopes themselves are split into Primary Scopes and Supporting Scopes. The Primary Scopes are the activities that directly help grow and sustain Maker. They include Protocol Engineering, Decentralized Collateral, RWA Collateral, and Growth The Supporting Scopes are additional focus areas that provide critical structure and backend services necessary for the Primary Scopes to perform properly, as well as structure and support for MetaDAOs. A Scope can be defined as governance focus area - the key thing that determines if a particular focus area should be stand-alone Scope is whether Maker Governance and independent MKR holders specifically should have easy access to understand the state of the particular challenge or opportunity. The goal is that by checking all the Scopes it is possible for an MKR holder to reasonable get a complete high level overview where no critical gaps are missing.  Complete overview of the Maker Ecosystem with Scopes, MetaDAOs and Ecosystem Actors  Scopemap11920\u00d71552 225 KB  The Scopes are covered in depth by 3 different groups: The Decentralized Voter Committees, Delegates and Governor Councils and Tribunals. The groups come together in quarterly DVC Subcommittee meetings and define the high level rules and principles of the Scope through a document called the Scope Framework, that is proposed and ratified or amended by Maker Governance through an MKR vote. The voter approved Scope Framework then guides and determines all further decisions and processes carried out within the umbrella of the Scope throughout the Decentralized Workforce and the Maker Ecosystem. The Primary Scopes are large and have a lot of resources available. As a result, to improve transparency and accountability, they operate with a separation of powers principle where the Decentralized workforce members that define the Scope Framework (Councils) are separate from the decentralized workforce members that interpret and execute according to the framework (Core Units). This makes it safe for Maker to scale up the resources and allow multiple processes to run in parallel. The basic process is that first the Scope Framework is defined by the DVCs, Delegates and Council. The Council is made up of representatives from all Governor MetaDAOs. Then Core Units interpret, prioritize and propose projects. Each Governor MetaDAO may operate its own Core Unit within the Primary Scope. Funding for the project may provided solely from the Core Unit itself, or may also be supported with budget from a Budget Allocator. When the project has been decided and funding secured, the best supplier for the projects are found from separate MetaDAOs or Ecosystem Actors that carry out the work based on a predetermined Statement of Work that itself must adhere to the best practices defined the Scope Framework. It is critical that once again the Separation of Powers principle is followed to prevent any self dealing by the Core Units. Every time a cycle of successful or unsucessful work is carried out, learnings from the process are analyzed by the council and used to propose improvements and expansion of the Scope Frameworks to make them as consistent as possible while covering as many normal and edge cases as possible. The goal of the Endgame governance process is that there are no surprises and everything follows predetermined processes that continuously improve to become more and more secure and predictable over time.  Example of work cycle of the Protocol Engineering Scope  Step 1: DVCs, Delegates and Council agrees on a Scope Framework. As an example this could specify the process used to determine when it is worth it to deploy a new Synthetic Asset, such as EuroDai, and the steps that need to be followed when deploying a Synthetic Asset in accordance with best practice  Scopemap21920\u00d71678 256 KB   Step 2: With the Scope Framework in place the Core Units now have clear guidance on when and how to initiate the deployment of a new Synthetic Asset, and how to determine which contributor (MetaDAO or Ecosystem Actor) that should be paid to carry out the work.  Scopemap31920\u00d71812 292 KB   Step3: The last step is to construct the Executive vote that activates the new Synthetic Asset, and wait for the MKR holders and Delegates to vote it through  Scopemap41920\u00d71767 287 KB  Fully specified processes like this example onboarding of a Synthetic Asset must be developed for each process in all 11 Scopes. By having the processes specified in the greatest detail possible, it prevents risk of grey area uncertainty becoming a beachhead for complexity expansion and scope creep. ",

I see for example, Finance and Stability and Liquidity which are very close to the AML framework from Strategic Finance CU from my understanding, but also the liquidity side is a topic related to Growth CU and collaborations with other protocols, companies, etc. So I easily see a set of contributors providing support to such scopes, but right now those contributors are organized in separate CUs, so what is the construct in Maker Core to offer incentives to these contributors (current or new ones) to organize to deliver on these scopes? I have the same question for many other scopes, so feel free to change the example to something that is more useful. I guess what I\u2019m asking is: do you foresee a core unit clustering as well of some type? ",

                    "content": "It will be a gradual and deliberate process, that will slowly get into place over the course of the pregame (which will last about a year until the MetaDAOs launch). So initially all existing Core Units would just be loosely mapped to Scopes - many Scopes would also have no Core Units or Tribunals initially, and would just be entirely voter and delegate run. The process of mapping Core Units to Scopes would occur formally through an overhaul of the MIP39 MIP Set sometime during the Pregame phase, which would also introduce the new Mandated Actor types of Coucils and Tribunals. Then over time the workforce would expand following the framework off the Scopes to prevent unpredictable and unaccountable complexity growth. But it is of course important to not move too fast and change things too early, and instead just slowly adapt at a pace that allows us to adjust our approach based on the results we from the initial implementation steps.
