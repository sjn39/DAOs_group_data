                    "content": " KERNEL: A custom educational web This proposal seeks to establish a GitcoinDAO workstream for KERNEL, a custom web3 educational institution, built carefully to create the conditions to encourage better humans, building a better web. It is a transformative educational experience in web3.  AMENDED TL;DR x2 KERNEL seeks an amended 49K in GTC for Season 14 (a 67% reduction from our original request of 150K GTC), our first as a GitcoinDAO workstream. KERNEL is spinning out from Gitcoin Holdings with ~$100K USDC in treasury, after two years building KERNEL within Gitcoin Holdings. KERNEL is a unique experience for both web3 newcomers and web3 veterans, allowing KERNEL to guide talented contributors across the web3 ecosystem, whether that is GitcoinDAO, other protocols, or stewarding their own projects. KERNEL ultimately hopes to be an educational institution that is a public good, creating positive externalities for web3, first and foremost, by having a positive impact on the lives of KERNEL Fellows and the communities they are responsible for. These communities are wide-ranging, including a variety of high potential web3 protocols, projects, DAO\u2019s, and other adventures. Already, seven early stage KERNEL projects are slated to give .5% of tokens/equity to the KERNEL treasury during S14, with a potential for 15 more during S15 and S16. We still have many blocks to come. Because Gitcoin Holdings already holds 24% of \u2018team governance rights\u2019 in KERNEL, and hopes to transition this to the DAO, we think this will serve GitcoinDAO well over time as we collaborate to build a public institution for all. Our intention is to raise funding for KERNEL in a completely web3-native way (directly from protocols, no venture funding), starting at home with GitcoinDAO. We took inspiration from Nomic Labs, who recently completed a similar fundraise for Hardhat with $2MM in anchor support from the Ethereum Foundation and support from Uniswap, Optimism, Aave, and others for a total $30MM fundraise. We hope GitcoinDAO will consider being KERNEL\u2019s anchor partner. This (shortened and trimmed) proposal describes a bit about our last two years, but focuses on our use of 49K GTC during S14 and our intentions as a GitcoinDAO workstream for S14 - S16. You can see the original proposal for 150K GTC, which has been now reduced by 67%, by starting here. The section that immediately follows will focus on the amendments to the original proposal, including a brief update to milestones and the thinner budget for S14.  Milestone report Since this section did not change much, we refer you to the section below from the original proposal. In early discussions on this proposal, we believe one significant milestone went underrepresented as a feature of KERNEL.     vivek:  However, over the next five years, we expect the KERNEL Treasury will grow the most via KERNEL Adventures. Through the generosity of an initial seven initial KERNEL Adventures who have committed between .5% - 1% of equity or tokens to the KERNEL treasury, our eyes open to the possibility that a KERNEL Treasury can be a continuous stream to draw upon for KERNEL into perpetuity, if given time to grow.   We are very grateful to have the trust of a variety of KERNEL Fellows who have co-created KERNEL with us. Their generosity has led to the potential for a KERNEL Endowment to grow perpetually, over time, and support us in building a healthy educational system into perpetuity. We will never require a fellow to give back to the treasury, but we will receive these contributions with open arms, knowing that they help us to continue mindfully expanding the play. We expect, given we\u2019ve spent time with hundreds of such projects in KERNEL, that the KERNEL Treasury may be seeded well with tokens or equity from ~20 projects between S14 - S16.  Phases & Use Of Funds S14 begins with Phase 1,  the specifics of the next phases for KERNEL, including our efforts around growing KERNEL steadily, along with educational, financial, and creative infrastructure.  Phase 1: KB6\u2019s Empty Block (S14) Phase 2: KB7, KB8, and a KERNEL Endowment (S15, S16) Phase Infinity: The Evolving Infinite Game  no funding)  Because Phase 2 and Phase Infinity do not have significant changes in the amendment, you can find them in the original proposal below.  Phase 1: Conduct KB6\u2019s \u2018Empty Block\u2019 49K GTC would allow us to begin with the following phase in S14 of GitcoinDAO. KERNEL\u2019s Block 6 will be a unique one. We will not be opening up new applications for KERNEL Block 6, rather choosing to spend the summer in communion with many of the existing KERNEL Fellows while releasing our progress on a variety of 1) web3 (funding, artistic, and research) experiments and 2) infrastructure for communities of care. Our intention is to explore fresh conversational spaces we have yet to open together and enter into KERNEL\u2019s next phase with strong footing.  Run KERNEL Blocks 6, an \u201cempty\u201d block, focusing on the following projects, artifacts, and activities:  KERNEL Treasury - establishing a KERNEL Treasury which stewards a variety of tokens from GTC, other leading web3 protocols, and KERNEL projects. Explore legal models for a perpetual KERNEL Endowment.  Project Unprofile - exploring open and holistic means of connecting peers in KERNEL and beyond  Convo - a simple web app to organize intentional gatherings and great conversations  Signature Economies - an essay intended to create \u201csignificant\u201d money Select KERNEL Block 7, welcoming the next 300+ KERNEL Fellows KERNEL Block 7 will begin September 9th, 2022    We also intend to serve in a meta-governance role in GTC, offering our perspective in protocol governance for the first time, using the KERNEL syllabus as a grounding structure. If this experiment goes well, we may continue to do so in other web3 projects, primarily those who have experienced KERNEL and pledge tokens to the KERNEL Treasury. A detailed breakdown of use of funds for Phase 1, intended for S14 of GitcoinDAO is below:  image1596\u00d7928 75.5 KB  Please note in the second amendment, GitcoinDAO is providing funds only for KB6, KB7, and the Infinite Game for a total of 49K GTC. We have left the engineering / creative efforts here for context on what is also being explored by KERNEL during Phase 1.  Closing Thoughts GitcoinDAO is a schelling point for creators and funders of digital public goods who want to build the common architecture that will allow hundreds of DAOs to succeed in non-extractive, collaborative and complementary ways. KERNEL aims to be a home for many of those creators. This all means that we value GitcoinDAO as a space where we can safely explore what it means for KERNEL to be a public good. In providing 49K GTC, and potentially supporting across 2-3 seasons, GitcoinDAO provides the seed in an imperfect garden of giving which may last a generation.     vivek:  In looking for stories here, I come back to a story of Dale Carnegie giving a $2mm grant to technical universities in Pittsburgh, which was used to start a small endowment. This directly led to Carnegie Mellon University, whose endowment today sits at $3.1 billion, serving 14,000 students yearly. Who might a similar institute in web3 serve? How might we improve upon educational models for all? Is this a public good worth exploring alongside GitcoinDAO? It is my sense that GitcoinDAO, and other web3 treasuries, have the ability to give in this way \u2013 not as wealthy philanthropists or as venture capitalists, but because public goods are good and web3 gives us the potential that value may accrue to those who support them. This lively gift economy may bring us to healthier, more holistic institutions which don\u2019t fall into similar traps as previous technologies and paradigms.   We look forward to being involved as collaborators in GitcoinDAO via CSDO, in governance proposals, and in sharing our perspective around public goods, educational environments, and coordination tools. Thank you for your kind attention.\u200b We look forward to the many ways we could give this gift forward. After all, it isn\u2019t ours to begin with.  === The original KERNEL S14 proposal: Comments below === tl;dr: This proposal seeks to establish a GitcoinDAO workstream for KERNEL, a custom web3 educational institution, built carefully to create the conditions to encourage better humans, building a better web. We seek 150K in GTC for Season 14. After two years within Gitcoin Holdings, KERNEL is seeking $5mm in total funding from the ecosystem as a part of its transition to a KERNEL Foundation (a Cayman Foundation Company). GitcoinDAO is our intended anchor co-conspirator, and we would like to join as a workstream for ~3 seasons, S14 - S16. Separate from GitcoinDAO, we intend to explore $2-3mm contributions with a variety of other value-aligned ecosystems within web3, open source, and public goods communities to achieve our fundraising goal. Starting with Genesis Block in May 2020, KERNEL has run five KERNEL blocks to much celebration internally and acclaim externally, alongside 1,200 KERNEL fellows building 200+ web3 projects (more here). Along with the steady drumbeat of running KERNEL Blocks, this workstream intends to create a variety of financial, communal, educational and artistic tools for \u2018communities of care\u2019, which we hold to be amongst the most significant public goods web3 can create. Our intention is to establish an infinite game which would allow KERNEL to be healthily self-sustaining into perpetuity within a few short years, to the benefit of GitcoinDAO, KERNEL, and hopefully, humans interested in a more caring internet. We first describe KERNEL, then share a roadmap for this infinite game, use of funds, and parting thoughts from the KERNEL Syllabus.  KERNEL as Public Good Any meaningful shift, within self or society, begins with how we learn and teach. Valuable knowledge may present itself for free, but it must be given attention, intention, and reflection in order to become personally meaningful. It is this paradox which makes educational gifts the seed around which a community crafting new value models can flourish: \u201ca single flower blooms, and throughout the world it is spring\u201d. Enter KERNEL: a trust space for talented individuals to use Web 3 as a means to explore their humanity more holistically. KERNEL begins with a KERNEL \u201cBlock\u201d: an 8 week experience, anchored by 16 lessons which is filled by 250 interested, talented, and diverse peers. The topics in a KERNEL block transcend web3 - starting with trust, moving through meaning and value, and eventually ending in giving and scale-ability. These (free and open-source) lessons provide fertile ground for an eight week experience which is ultimately co-created by the KERNEL Fellows who interact with 1) the content and 2) each other. A deepening of personal spirit and the relationships KERNEL Fellows form with each are the primary orientations of the program. KERNEL aims to be a living example of what it means to live well together. The experience provides questions, not answers, as we explore: how can we build better lives for ourselves as we build a better web for us all? KERNEL Fellows are builders at leading web3 companies as founders, dancers, technologists, gamers, economists, designers, artists, and musicians. They deeply enjoy each others company and transcend these distinctions every time we meet them again.  What is KERNEL\u2019s most fertile path? \u201cThere are at least two kinds of games. One could be called finite, the other infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.\u201d \u201cThe rules of an infinite game must change in the course of play. The rules are changed when the players of an infinite game agree that the play is imperiled by a finite outcome \u2014 that is, by the victory of some players and the defeat of others. The rules of an infinite game are changed to prevent anyone from winning the game and to bring as many persons as possible into the play.\u201d -Dr. James P. Carse, Finite & Infinite Games 150K in GTC prepares us for our next act \u2013 establishing KERNEL as an \u201cinfinite\u201d pattern for communities of care by:  Running KERNEL blocks ad infinitum Establishing a perpetual, web3 native funding model for KERNEL Open-sourcing peer-to-peer educational tools & patterns Creating meaningful, timeless web3 artifacts  Each of these share a fundamental \u201cinfinite\u201d, or \u201cperpetual\u201d characteristic: they avoid short-term outcomes, unhealthy competition, and aim to grow healthier with time.  Funding The Infinite KERNEL While our approach to growing community and seeding educational spaces also lean upon infinite game philosophy, we outline below how KERNEL uses it to plan for a healthy financial future for KERNEL and to provide value to GitcoinDAO. Our first step towards a sustainable, regenerative KERNEL are setting up 1) a public KERNEL Treasury and exploring 2) a KERNEL Endowment. The KERNEL Treasury will begin with $50K in tokens KERNEL has raised thus far through past KERNEL Blocks and an influx of $100K USDC from Gitcoin Holdings, upon spinout. It would grow substantially if our intended $5mm grant raise from GitcoinDAO and other value-aligned protocols is successful, beginning with this workstream. However, over the next five years, we expect the KERNEL Treasury will grow the most via KERNEL Adventures. Through the generosity of an initial seven initial KERNEL Adventures who have committed between .5% - 1% of equity or tokens to the KERNEL treasury, our eyes open to the possibility that a KERNEL Treasury can be a continuous stream to draw upon for KERNEL into perpetuity, if given time to grow. In Phase 1, we aim to use the $5mm in commitments from GitcoinDAO and other leading web3 ecosystems, alongside less liquid tokens from KERNEL Alumni, to give ourselves that time. In Phase 2, we will consider establishing a public KERNEL endowment. Endowments have had notable success in co-creating some of the strongest public infrastructure in the world, both physically and financially. They are perpetual in nature, \u201cmanaged with consideration given to current and future beneficiaries with the goal of providing the same level of economic support to both in perpetuity.\u201d Our expectation is this workstream will lead us to answers on exactly how this might support KERNEL\u2019s efforts into perpetuity within a new, web3 context. The effort from here then, for KERNEL, is a simple life\u2019s work: give the gift back.  1552\u00d71204 156 KB   Phases & Use Of Funds More on the specifics of the next phases for KERNEL, including our efforts around growing KERNEL steadily, along with educational, financial, and creative infrastructure.  Phase 1: KB6\u2019s Empty Block (S14) Phase 2: KB7, KB8, and a KERNEL Endowment (S15, S16) Phase Infinity: The Evolving Infinite Game (no funding)   Phase 1: Conduct KB6\u2019s \u2018Empty Block\u2019 150K GTC would allow us to begin with the following phase in S14 of GitcoinDAO. KERNEL\u2019s Block 6 will be a unique one. We will not be opening up new applications for KERNEL Block 6, rather choosing to spend the summer in communion with many of the existing KERNEL Fellows while releasing our progress on a variety of 1) web3 (funding, artistic, and research) experiments and 2) infrastructure for communities of care. Our intention is to explore fresh conversational spaces we have yet to open together and enter into KERNEL\u2019s next phase with strong footing.  Run KERNEL Blocks 6, an \u201cempty\u201d block, focusing on the following projects, artifacts, and activities:  KERNEL Treasury Models - establishing a KERNEL Treasury which stewards a variety of tokens from GTC, other leading web3 protocols, and KERNEL adventures. Explore legal models for a perpetual KERNEL Endowment. Project Unprofile - exploring open and holistic means of connecting peers in KERNEL and beyond  Convo - a simple web app to organize intentional gatherings and great conversations  Signature Economies - an essay intended to create \u201csignificant\u201d money   Select KERNEL Block 7, welcoming the next 300+ KERNEL Fellows  KERNEL Block 7 will begin September 9th, 2022    We also intend to serve in a meta-governance role in GTC, offering our perspective in protocol governance for the first time, using the KERNEL syllabus as a grounding structure. If this experiment goes well, we may continue to do so in other web3 projects, primarily those who have experienced KERNEL and pledge tokens to a KERNEL Endowment.  Phase 2: KB7, KB8, and a KERNEL Endowment With a treasury in place, Phase 2 (S15 and S16) will be about running KB7 & KB8, welcoming 600 new people to KERNEL. We will use the infrastructure of Phase 1 towards building a KERNEL Endowment and sprouting new peer-to-peer environments for KERNEL Fellows and web3 communities.  Run KERNEL Blocks 7 / 8, welcoming the next 600+ KERNEL Fellows Continue the build of long-term oriented web3 artifacts and tooling  Free Learn - a set of contracts and the accompanying React modules required for anyone to create their own educational offerings which generate revenue while remaining free for those who learn from them Margins of Meaning - a super secret shadow project to promote meaningful economies   KERNEL Endowment: Consider the healthiest long term structure between the KERNEL Treasury and a KERNEL Endowment, alongside other fund models   Phase Infinity: The Evolving Infinite Game We expect, following S16, to be complete with Phases 1 and 2 and to be a self-sustaining ecosystem. KERNEL will continue to orient around 16 principles and sense our way to the most fertile path. We expect these north stars to remain with us:  Serve as a premier example of a \u2018community of care\u2019 within the broader web3 community ecosystem and internet culture at large Create a set of open-source tools, patterns, artifacts, and customs intended to enable peer-to-peer living in other community contexts  The KERNEL Block: a peer-to-peer learning environment driven by the humans who participate in it, more than any particular piece of content or inspiration The KERNEL Endowment: A perpetual funding mechanism, drawing upon endowments and web3 native value structure Kernel Artifacts: encouraging the creation of artifacts which blend the artistic with the functional, the beautiful with the organic, the generative with the regenerative    In each of these efforts, KERNEL aims to be a clear container which embeds reciprocity and relationship at its core. It aims to include more and diverse voices within the web3 story. It will deeply nurture a shared experience for KERNEL Fellows and all \u2018communities of care\u2019, so that we might imagine and live our most vibrant present moments in communion with one another. \u201cThe real truth, the real church is coming to the human being. Ain\u2019t nothing in this world gonna get in your way \u2018cause you can\u2019t see it or talk to it. All you can do is experience it. Eternity is not a word, it\u2019s an existence.\u201d \u2013 Ornette Coleman  Why GitcoinDAO We choose to make this proposal to GitcoinDAO for a number of reasons. KERNEL was originally created and built within Gitcoin Holdings, which means we have strong ties to Gitcoin, both socially and structurally.  I (Vivek Singh) served as COO of Gitcoin Holdings for 3 years (2019-2021), and KERNEL was originally constructed in May 2020 at Gitcoin as we looked to find a home for the best and brightest people we met through our work - across hackathons, Gitcoin Grants rounds, and beyond. Sachin Mittal (co-founder of KERNEL) and Angela Gilhotra also were employed by Gitcoin Holdings, in roles centered around developer advocacy and both co-created KERNEL  @cryptowanderer and @sidcode are stewards at GitcoinDAO. Andy expressed his interest in May 2021 and Sid has been involved in the day-to-day operations of the DAO as a tech lead for the MMM workstream for 8+ months now and has contributed across PGF, FDD, and MC in various capacities. We\u2019ve worked closely with various efforts of the DAO (Gitcoin Grants Rounds, Public Goods are Good, Memepalooza, and more). Gitcoin Holdings, as a part of incubating and spinning KERNEL out into the ecosystem, holds an ongoing voice in KERNEL\u2019s governance and would receive 24% of \u2018team governance rights\u2019 if there was a token distribution. The intention is for these rights to move to GitcoinDAO over time, per conversations with @owocki and Gitcoin Holdings leadership  A more expansive lens is that GitcoinDAO is a schelling point for creators and funders of digital public goods who want to build the common architecture that will allow hundreds of DAOs to succeed in non-extractive, collaborative and complementary ways. KERNEL aims to be a homebase for many of those creators. This all means that we value GitcoinDAO as a space where we can safely explore what it means for KERNEL to be a public good. We look forward to being involved as collaborators in GitcoinDAO via CSDO, in governance proposals, and in sharing our perspective around public goods, educational environments, and coordination tools.  KERNEL As Gift This brings us back, finally, to the core of KERNEL: the giving of gifts. Gift-giving has always been the heart of genuine teaching and at the heart of Web 3. Both Satoshi and university endowments play on this same concept. We\u2019re asking for a gift that will both allow us to continue exploring the most valuable ways to think about - and live within - web3, and that the gift may bring you into a lively circle of continuous and imperfect gift-giving. We are looking for the kind of people who understand value in similar ways to KERNEL Fellows, and who want to explore what it means to create sacred transactional spaces by extending human trust within a trustless medium. Thank you for your kind attention.\u200b\u200b We hope for comments from near and far and to share much more about this institution for all, one block at a time. We look forward to the many ways we could give this gift forward. After all, it isn\u2019t ours to begin with. ",

Our governance and consensus briefs might be helpful introductions to the types of ideas we lean upon and the way KERNEL might engage.     vivek:   A variety of GitcoinDAO contributors have been with us in KERNEL including Lani Trock, Kris Decoodt, sidcode, Michelle Ma, Linh Tran, Ben Percifield, Tanaya Vikrant, Maxwell Kanter, and others.    As it relates to cross-DAO collaborations, KERNEL is excited to engage in CSDO as we best can. We feel quite well positioned to do so, mostly due to the KERNEL Fellows we know incredibly well and trust deeply that are sprinkled around other GitcoinDAO workstreams, alongside our history within Gitcoin Holdings. @sidcode has also been actively involved both in GitcoinDAO and as a KERNEL Steward, which provides us a healthy conduit as a beginning. We welcome finding the right balance here. Will respond on funding in a separate message, and responded to @Pop on the roadmap one message above here. Thank you for taking the time to explore here.

I don\u2019t think this is in the best interest of Gitcoin and I am surprised you feel this in the best interest of Kernel.   KERNEL, ultimately, hopes to be an educational institution that is a public good, creating positive externalities for web3, first and foremost, by having a positive impact on the lives of KERNEL Fellows and the communities they are responsible for. These communities are wide-ranging. In order to do so, KERNEL must walk a narrow path. Namely, it must find funding sources that are least likely to introduce ulterior incentives and most likely to support an open environment for exploration, play, healthy experimentation, and deep care. Our intention, therefore, is to raise funding in a completely web3-native way (directly from protocols, no venture funding). We took inspiration from Nomic Labs, who recently completely a similar fundraise for Hardhat with anchor support from the Ethereum Foundation and support from a variety of others, including Uniswap, Optimism, Aave, and others. In our case, we would like GitcoinDAO to be our anchor partner. This is because public goods and reciprocal coordination are at the core of what we explore in KERNEL and GitcoinDAO has created the most important schelling point around these topics in web3. We think there is a real chance this gift could support us in a way no other protocol could as we build a premier educational institution on a multi-decade journey.     owocki:  how much of the tokens you plan to receive will come from gitcoindao vs other grant programs?   GitcoinDAO, if KERNEL was a workstream for 3 seasons, would range from 33% - 40% of the $5mm we aim to raise. Our plan was to start closest to come with GitcoinDAO and move from there. However, stewards or foundation members of 3 top protocols have expressed interest in championing a KERNEL proposal. These will become public in the coming weeks and months, we expect.     owocki:   will it remain at the 24% of \u201cteam governance rights\u201d that has been previously agreed or does that slide up as more GTC is allocated to KERNEL?    KERNEL\u2019s success in finding it\u2019s healthiest source of funding, of course, does also practically accrue benefit to GitcoinDAO, as is referenced by @owocki here. The 24% of \u2018team governance rights\u2019 means that if KERNEL is successful, GitcoinDAO will have a large part to play in that story on an ongoing basis, shaping what a web3 public good institution might look like over a long time horizon. Our hope in following the Nomic Labs model is to treat this workstream proposal as a regular grant / workstream, not a mutual grant. If, after 3 seasons, additional funding was required, we would understand the request for a sliding scale. I do empathize and understand the need for mutual grants, and using the venture capital paradigm, I understand why this might immediately look like a candidate for a mutual grant. In looking for stories here, I come back to a story of Dale Carnegie giving a $2mm grant to technical universities in Pittsburgh, which was used to start a small endowment. This directly led to Carnegie Mellon University, whose endowment today sits at $3.1 billion, serving 14,000 students yearly. Who might a similar institute in web3 serve? How might we improve upon educational models for all? Is this a public good worth exploring alongside GitcoinDAO? It is my sense that GitcoinDAO, and other web3 treasuries, have the ability to give in this way \u2013 not as wealthy philanthropists or as venture capitalists, but because public goods are good and web3 gives us the potential that value may accrue to those who support them. This lively gift economy may bring us to healthier, more holistic institutions which don\u2019t fall into similar traps as previous technologies and paradigms. We don\u2019t worry as much about KERNEL\u2019s brand being affected by this, but rather, have a sense that it as on-brand as we can get  we welcome being intertwined with GitcoinDAO and finding ways to make public goods as good as they can be this century, starting with KERNEL and the wonderful fellows who spend time with us. To that end, I\u2019ll end with a passage from \u2018The Gift\u2019, an interesting brief in KERNEL Module 7, and welcome ways we may improve upon our thinking here.  image1426\u00d7532 94.2 KB  ",

In my view, KERNEL was in many ways a proto-workstream back in 2020, when the company was still the main way for Gitcoin to achieve its mission. Now that we\u2019re a formal DAO, it seems natural that KERNEL might find ways to achieve its mission as part of that journey prior to becoming a side-DAO as in the impact DAO vision Owocki outlined here. I\u2019d love to have the mutual grants committee help figure out what that eventual path looks like after several seasons. Still, with that in mind, I do think the ask is quite high for a first season workstream, and I\u2019d recommend potentially reducing the ask to around 90-100K GTC with perhaps half of that committed as a starting stipend for meta-governance (i.e. left unspent for say a 6 month window).

Six years ago I decided that I needed to commit my life to a purpose, to have something bigger than me that would always be my north star. Previously, I had thought of finding purpose like \u201clove at first sight\u201d. I thought I was in some cosmic game that would randomly show me my purpose and I would be wise enough to recognize it. When I decided that I was in control and could select my purpose, I thought to myself \u201cWhat is the most noble goal possible\u201d After months of thinking and writing, I landed on EDUCATION. But I am not a teacher. I\u2019m something more like a systems engineer with a focus on adaptive processes. How could I affect education? Education is THE fundamental public good. Our neighbors having access to education makes our lives better. Everyone should always have access to education. In fact, the value that it creates could be accounted for using Ostrom\u2019s SES Framework and then redistributed to others. Maybe there is a level of education where people are less prone to violence? Anyway, all that is to say that the reason I am here is because from a system engineering viewpoint, I thought the best way I could possibly work towards my mission was to build and evangelize DAOs to eventually provide free education to everyone for life. In fact, if they can\u2019t get paid to work, they should get paid to learn. That is my purpose. I\u2019m supporting this proposal WITHOUT a clause for return because I have ALREADY felt the benefits of the Kernel community in the world. I went to Metacamp last month with 35 DAO leaders and we had a whole discussion on how Kernel isn\u2019t only the best web 3 education available, but it is a leader in cultivating the VALUES we claim Web 3 will have. It is the premier education for how the world shifts from a paradigm of competition, to a paradigm of collaboration. We might be best to think of this a retroactive public goods funding, but it really doesn\u2019t matter to me. The Kernel program deserves support of the Gitcoin community. ",

The amendment is reflected in the topline message, with a new TL;DR, emphasis on the plan for a KERNEL Treasury, and a new S14 budget.     vivek:  AMENDED TL;DR KERNEL seeks an amended 96K in GTC for Season 14 (a 36% reduction from our original request of 150K GTC), our first as a GitcoinDAO workstream. KERNEL is spinning out from Gitcoin Holdings with ~$100K USDC in treasury, after two years building KERNEL within Gitcoin Holdings. KERNEL is a unique experience for both web3 newcomers and web3 veterans , allowing KERNEL to guide talented contributors across the web3 ecosystem, whether that is GitcoinDAO, other protocols, or stewarding their own projects. KERNEL ultimately hopes to be an educational institution that is a public good, creating positive externalities for web3, first and foremost, by having a positive impact on the lives of KERNEL Fellows and the communities they are responsible for. These communities are wide-ranging, including a variety of high potential web3 protocols, projects, DAO\u2019s, and other adventures. Already, seven early stage KERNEL projects are slated to give .5% of tokens/equity to the KERNEL treasury during S14, with a potential for 15 more during S15 and S16. We still have many blocks to come. Because Gitcoin Holdings already holds 24% of \u2018team governance rights\u2019 in KERNEL, and hopes to transition this to the DAO, we think this will serve GitcoinDAO well over time as we collaborate to build a public institution for all. Our intention is to raise funding for KERNEL in a completely web3-native way (directly from protocols, no venture funding), starting at home with GitcoinDAO.   This was a significant slimming exercise but it is one we feel confident can still work (with less room for external open source contributors). We appreciate all of the thoughts throughout and hope that this proposal better describes the reciprocal ways we hope KERNEL and GitcoinDAO may operate for years to come. ",

I\u2019ll start by saying that, like @DisruptionJoe, I feel a deep affinity with & love for KERNEL. I, too, believe education is THE fundamental public good - and I\u2019ve seen & experienced firsthand the learning, the connection, the beauty, and the safe space that KERNEL brings to the Web3 ecosystem at large. I would love for the DAO and KERNEL to explore means of mutual collaboration, and would even be open to exploring the idea of the DAO Treasury generously providing some funding to KERNEL. That said, I really don\u2019t think a DAO workstream is the right structure for a relationship between the DAO and KERNEL. Why\u2019s that?   KERNEL is already becoming its own entity With KERNEL becoming an established entity having its own completely separate governance structure, I don\u2019t think it makes sense for it to also be a DAO workstream. This, too, is why I am voting \u2018no\u2019 to the mintkudos.xyz proposal. As I mentioned there, all current GitcoinDAO workstreams are teams that are dedicated to the DAO at-large - rather than having the DAO as just one of many affiliations. KERNEL or mintkudos.xyz becoming their own workstreams would bring about a set of new considerations/challenges that I don\u2019t think we are prepared to prioritize facing right now.   I do not see it serving the Protocol DAO mission While KERNEL is consistent with the \u2018learn\u2019 mandate within Gitcoin\u2019s previous earn/learn/connect/fund framing, as we move intentionally towards being a Protocol DAO, I do not see a strategic fit in the context of the workstreams we are standing up in service of that mission.   (As an aside, a thought for CSDO & DAO governance consideration, generally speaking - together, this proposal and the mintkudos.xyz proposal make me question whether we might create other avenues for such requests that are not workstream formations.) Although I plan to vote \u2018no\u2019 on this proposal for KERNEL to become a workstream, I want to reiterate my love for & support of the program. I do earnestly hope we can establish another flavour of relationship that can support KERNEL in its worthy ambitions. ",

As of now, GitcoinDAO generally needs to streamline our workstreams in the coming months. I would like to suggest that Kernel focus on its core priorities for now, namely having funding for KB6, KB7 and building a KERNEL treasury. I think GitcoinDAO would make an excellent anchor partner as Kernel transitions to an endowment funded model. This would make the budget just     Item GTC Amount     Kernel Blocks 6+7 39k GTC ($330k USD)   Infinite Game 10k GTC ($60k USD)    This would be just 1/3 of the original ask. I think right now, Kernel needs GitcoinDAO\u2019s support more than ever and I implore that fellow stewards (@krrisis @kyle @Pop @ceresstation @seedphrase ) consider giving Kernel the breathing space for the year ahead. Kernel adds a lot of value in terms of the folks that we bring to GitcoinDAO + bringing in potential funders of public goods. I\u2019d also like to suggest that projects grown within Kernel sign a giving pledge to public goods which can help to justify value accrual to the protocol. ",

Seeking more from Gitcoin doesn\u2019t feel appropriate. I am of the opinion Kernel really needs to stand on its own (and that was the goal with the seed funding as part of the spin out from Holdings).

We reach the end of the road a bit wearied, but nonetheless excited for the future of GitcoinDAO & KERNEL well beyond today\u2019s shifting tides. To be brief, we have made a final and substantial amendment to the KERNEL Proposal, reducing our ask to 49K GTC for our first quarter as a workstream within GitcoinDAO. This suggestion was originally made by @Fishbiscuit and has been enacted in the main proposal here.     vivek:  A detailed breakdown of use of funds for Phase 1, intended for S14 of GitcoinDAO is below:  Please note in the second amendment, GitcoinDAO is providing funds only for KB6, KB7, and the Infinite Game for a total of 49K GTC. We have left the engineering / creative efforts here for context on what is also being explored by KERNEL during Phase 1, which may be funded via alternative paths.   I\u2019d like to address a few thoughts beyond simply reducing the proposal amount, although I do hope this is a substantial gesture in our understanding that: (a) GitcoinDAO is in a precarious position and must show wisdom as we enter a new cycle (h/t @linda for this resource), and (b) while we feel strongly KERNEL is worth funding, solidifying our unique exploration as a smaller workstream may be healthier at this time.     annika:  That said, I really don\u2019t think a DAO workstream is the right structure for a relationship between the DAO and KERNEL.   One of the reasons is for (b) is posed by Annika here, in that KERNEL doesn\u2019t quite fit the mold for a GitcoinDAO workstream or a \u201cmutual grant\u201d today, given it\u2019s unique history within Gitcoin Holdings. We are starting our own entity, we have a complimentary mission (focused on a specific set of public goods, seeded around education), and are not explicitly focused on the ProtocolDAO. While these points are true, and Annika later alludes to a gap to be filled, I think this misses the following: KERNEL serves as a unique, important hedge to workstreams directly focused directly on a ProtocolDAO: a high-potential, independent entity experimenting with a clear, extremely high potential, win-win relationship with the DAO. This is an exercise in coordination which might serve as a model for other workstreams, mutual grants, or [insert new category] to consider as the future of GitcoinDAO & public goods funding unfolds. While we are entering a bear market, I think it serves GitcoinDAO well to ensure experiments like KERNEL are given a real chance to succeed as public goods and that attempts to coordinate in this way are not halted completely. If not here, then where?     Pop:  I feel this specifically is a great way to ensure value is flowing back into Gitcoin DAO as a result of funding Kernel and something we have been discussing has been missing from a lot of other workstreams\u2019 focus. If we can ensure this dynamic is sustainable, it would provide a great medium/long term flow of value for both Gitcoin and Kernel.   In closing, I am reminded of a specific, quieter part of the KERNEL syllabus on a spanish concept called Duende, which includes a poetic phrase or two.  Here is the heart of the struggle then: what we want is a miracle; what we have is a network of messy human beings. Do we have the creativity to see how these two are not any different?   It is good to know that glasses are to drink from; the bad thing is to not know what thirst is for.  In moving forward, I hope that we may find ways for KERNEL to participate as a healthy member of GitcoinDAO (as a workstream today, and perhaps, in other ways in the future) dedicated to honesty, trust, excellence, heightened awareness, and the ways in which messy humans might come together to do things that otherwise may seem impossible, starting with the simplest: caring for one another. We understand we would be joining GitcoinDAO in a period of struggle, and are dedicated and intertwined with the efforts of moving through it as well as we can, together. I close with a favorite passage from a dearest friend, the one and only @cryptowanderer:  Let\u2019s be honest then; what we\u2019re working for is a miracle. Many of us harbour the desire that a critical mass of people will wake up and realise that the ways we transact with one another and the ways that we organise our relationships and work surrender both power and value to a system consciously designed to extract the maximum profit it can. Moreover, that this realisation will also entail the creative and insightful use of the tools we already have, in the service of imagining new personal and political possibilities. This is the definition of a poetic hope, and it highlights the depths of the struggle which we must each face if we are to realise such a world.  ",

I opted not to create a voter guide since I feel they are currently imperfect (I do want to look at blending the different elements from each that could form the basis of a standard matrix for evaluating proposals as we evolve this process) and they reflect a singular individual perspective vs an objective guide to a decision making process. My vote for YES on the twice amended proposal reflects my desire to see Kernel continue its great work in onboarding, incubating and bringing value into the web3 ecosystem. Having witnessed the talent being pulled in [EXAMPLE REDACTED] and mentored some of the projects in Kernel in the past two years, the value to the open source ecosystem (and a means of funding this through education, mentorship and networking) cannot be denied. The continued work in looking at promoting mutual value exchange was highlighted here in the original proposal.     vivek:  These communities are wide-ranging, including a variety of high potential web3 protocols, projects, DAO\u2019s, and other adventures . Already, seven early stage KERNEL projects are slated to give .5% of tokens/equity to the KERNEL treasury during S14, with a potential for 15 more during S15 and S16. We still have many blocks to come.   As a result and because of Gitcoin\u2019s 24% in governance rights, the value will also flow back into Gitcoin. I believe @vivek also highlighted that here:     vivek:  The 24% of \u2018team governance rights\u2019 means that if KERNEL is successful, GitcoinDAO will have a large part to play in that story on an ongoing basis, shaping what a web3 public good institution might look like over a long time horizon. Our hope in following the Nomic Labs model is to treat this workstream proposal as a regular grant / workstream, not a mutual grant. If, after 3 seasons, additional funding was required, we would understand the request for a sliding scale.   Understanding that without this reduced funding the project may encounter tough times rending them unable to run further blocks, I choose to vote YES for this season. This by no means constitutes a FOREVER choice and any progress or lack thereof will be evaluated and a different vote may happen in the future. I believe in balance in all things and I shared my thoughts here on a post by @owocki from March  - it is important to make rational decisions that can enable the flow of value and this is my decision based on the context I have, based on the reduced amount requested and the reasons listed above which are true at this point in time when my decision is being recorded.

Here\u2019s why: (I have spoken to Vivek on the phone + articulated most of this to him already.) KERNELs impact in the market is undeniable, and I value Vivek and Andy\u2019s friendship, but there are major problems with this proposal (and KERNELs longevity) that need to be taken seriously. I wrote this post because the dao has responsibilities (1) to manage gitcoins own treasury outflows (2) press for some hard but necessary growth in KERNEL. Here are some reasons I decided I was against this proposal:  It is a signal of weakness in the funding market for KERNEL to come back to Gitcoin for funding after we\u2019ve already incubated & spun it out. KERNEL would be in a stronger position if they had an outside lead for their funding round. In the past, I\u2019ve made deals with KERNEL leadership where they don\u2019t follow through on their end of the bargain.  The pattern I\u2019ve seen is that they want something, they make some promises to get it, and when they get what they want, they forget the promises and dont follow through on them.   For this reason, I don\u2019t take them at their word that they\u2019ll be present in CSDO or any other GitcoinDAO oriented activities (& these are conditions of having a GitcoinDAO workstream). I still have brain damage from the damage Vivek caused to Gitcoin by being negligent as COO during mid/late 2020.   Vivek focused on KERNEL without prudently transferring his responsibilities over the rest of the Gitcoin portfolio.   In a counterfactual world in which he had been doing the job he had agreed upon - managing the product/teams teams performance, coaching them up, turning the team, shipping the stuff on our roadmap, and not just ignoring all of these responsibilities and letting the team culture rot - we wouldnt have had such a hard reset for kyle/lindsey/kevin olsen on the product side in 2021 (debt we are STILL paying down). The damage here is easily 5x-15x the financial cost of incubating KERNEL itself.  (maybe even larger if you consider how our market position has deteriorated without a functional product team).  Until I figured out what was going on, KERNEL was like a tapeworm consuming resources its host sorely needed.  Setting its host back 6-9 months in time, and creating endemic cultural rot that would take years to unwind.   I was over this when I thought there was going to be a clean deal to spinout KERNEL, but now that we\u2019re going to consider ongoing workstream relationship with them I think this history (and the damage it has done to my ability to trust Vivek) needs to be articulated. We set up the KERNEL spinout from holdings deal to give KERNEL runway.  That deal\u2019s terms made no mention of further funding from GitcoinDAO. KERNEL is essentially double dipping here by playing the dao and the holdco off each other (telling both that it needs it to fund the next 3-6 months of runway). The amount the holdings company gave KERNEL is enough runway for a team of 1 or 2 for a year, or a team of six for the next couple blocks. This proposal offers nothing back to GitcoinDAO. It\u2019s essential a \u201csomething for nothing\u201d proposal.   I believe that the proposal should be mutually beneficial. This proposal sets a precedent that Gitcoin will continue to fund KERNEL ad infinitum. KERNEL is not one of Gitcoin\u2019s Essential Intents.  In a bear market, the DAO should be especially scrutinizing what it funds.  Here is what I think should happen: Given the option, KERNEL chose independent governance.  Now they need to meet the moment and actually follow through to be independent from Gitcoin.  They need to stop returning the the DAO treasury (especially during scarcity times). That means:  Learn to fundraise outside of Gitcoin/GitcoinDAO. If KERNEL is going to fundraise from GitcoinDAO stop asking for ridiculous terms ($200k for no mutual benefit).  And show GitcoinDAO you will follow through on what you say you\u2019re going to do. Make the hard choices about how much burn KERNEL can handle. KERNEL has a staff of 6, which is huge for a project that doesnt want to raise VC and is pre-revenue and pre-financial sustainability.  I understand that this comment may seem harsh.   I value KERNEL, but I think it needs to do some growing up now that its \u201cleft the house\u201d.  I hope that these hard conversations lead to the eventual thriving of a more mature KERNEL. With tough love, Owocki ",

I wish it was under better circumstances, in a time of more abundance and alignment.     cryptowanderer:  This implication is false. KERNEL has been cash-positive since Genesis Block.   Based on my conversations with Vivek that are focused on financial scarcity, and my own understanding of the financials - I dont think thats true. Unless you take for granted the costs that Gitcoin holdings has been incurring to support KERNEL. You might be including a large one-time contribution to Gitcoin from a web3 partner in Q1 2021 that we booked as KERNEL revenue before it was disclosed to me that KERNEL intended to have its own brand and economics.  This was a special one-time circumstance where we booked ~$350k to KERNEL in order to balance our books before leaving Consensys (eg not owe any $$ back to Consensys at month-end upon spinout).  I do not think you can include this payment, which was generated through Gitcoin dealflow and only booked to KERNEL by way of this extremely special one time circumstance. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard KERNEL leadership assert that KERNEL is cash flow positive.  If KERNEL is cash flow positive, that conflicts with what I\u2019ve heard from the GitcoinDAO stewards.  I\u2019ve heard from a few of them that are under the impression that this proposal is \u201ckeep alive\u201d funding for KERNEL. The snapshot proposal implies to me that the next couple KERNEL Blocks would not happen without this funding.  Pasting that graphic below:  Screen Shot 2022-05-15 at 2.01.44 PM1196\u00d7444 180 KB      cryptowanderer:  Is asking for help a signal of weakness? This seems to be a question of taste.   I suppose it depends on the audience. Failing to raise money from an outside funder, and having to return to past funders, is absolutely considered a signal of weakness in the web3 and web2 fundraising worlds. But perhaps to other audiences of a different bent it is not.     cryptowanderer:  Please see all the people and projects listed who have gone through Kernel only to enter GitcoinDAO. This post implies no-one on that list has provided value. I believe that to be untrue.   It is nice to see the cultural interop between Gitcoin and KERNEL.  It is also nice to see KERNEL continue to raise $$$ on Gitcoin Grants and continue to leverage access to the rolodex of partners and legitimacy that Gitcoin has built. There are many mutually beneficial parts of this relationship that do not require extracting hundreds of thousands of $$$ more from Gitcoin to KERNEL per quarter. Gitcoin has already incubated KERNEL.  I find that fact continuously seems to be taken for granted.  So when I stop taking that for granted and soberly look at this proposal - I fail to see how this proposal extends more utility back to Gitcoin at a level commensurate with the ask. KERNEL chose independence from Gitcoin.  That doesn\u2019t mean independence only when you want it and dependence when independence is inconvenient for you.  I\u2019d like to see KERNEL follow through on becoming fully independent.     cryptowanderer:  Non-disclosures get in the way of full transparency here, so I simply invite you to think about whether we can create a healthy educational web with 1 or 2 people, and whether we should ever aim to.   I am aligned with your goal of creating a healthy educational web.  I just dont see why Gitcoin has to keep funding it. I know that KERNEL plans to build an endowment.  The analogue that @vivek explained to me was Carnege Mellon which was endowed by Andrew Carnege and Andrew Mellon - two wealthy philanthropists.   The Carnege Melon endowment started with several million $$ and is now worth $3.1 billion.  If Gitcoin was as financially successful as these two, enough to be a wealthy philanthropist, I think the situation would be different.  But unfortunately it is not. For context, Gitcoin has its own issues with focus and financial sustainability to figure out at the moment.  Supporting KERNEL when it was supposed to have already gone independent only adds to those burdens. There is more on this topic here: What would a Lean/Effective Gitcoin look like? \u23f3     cryptowanderer:  We\u2019ve stipulated a maximum of 3 seasons.   My mistake.  You are right.  You did stipulate a max of 3 seasons.     cryptowanderer:  I am, however, aware of my own limitations and now wonder if this is because I lost my brain some time ago?  I wish you all a better week ahead.   I too want to recognize my own limitations here.  I may be looking at this in a flawed way.  And I have not gone through KERNEL so I do not fully understand the community\u2019s values and philosophy. Let me restate that I would like to see KERNEL be very successful and create lots of good in the world.  I bare you no ill will, and I hope to see you be successful.  But I do believe it is outside of GitcoinDAOs primary focus right now.  Which forces some hard tradeoffs. And let me again state that I am one voice in the Gitcoin network. I do not even have any voting power in the DAO as I do not have any GTC delegated to me.  I pledge to accept the legitimacy of this proposals outcome no matter what the stewards decide. Wishing you a great week ahead too. ",

And i\u2019m pretty sure that might have happened already, without knowing further context. The thing is we, Gitcoin, also need help right now.

I\u2019d highly recommend it to anyone. It nourished me and inspired me during a moment I deeply needed it, and I\u2019ll be forever grateful to the entire Kernel team for emanating this power of the gift. You or anyone who feels so inclined can start right now right here. It\u2019s a public good. But that\u2019s only part of it, for the community part you need to apply for a Block, and hope there will be endless Blocks to come. We\u2019re always stronger together, and I hope we won\u2019t get lost in communication breakdowns on a forum, but knowing the people involved in this conversation and their aligned values and aspirations (re: a future world where public goods are always good and always funded) I think we are going to make it all in the end. Bear market or not.  I\u2019ll end with a quote by @cryptowanderer from Kernel, as an invitation to all of us to keep on exploring. I think there is endless opportunity here for mutual gifting and I hope we will continue to embody that spirit of \u2018service\u2019. From Module 7, the Gift   The psychology of giving reveals fascinating aspects of human consciousness. This is because gifts go against the scarcity we must navigate in order to survive and, in denying that scarcity, gift-giving is and always has been a profoundly meaningful act.   ",

I\u2019ll start with facts first and move from there into more subjective territories. Points 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 from @owocki are explicitly responded to throughout.     owocki:  KERNEL is essentially double dipping here by playing the dao and the holdco off each other (telling both that it needs it to fund the next 3-6 months of runway).   Due to legal process, the spinout of KERNEL has taken 8 months (which is the last time anyone at KERNEL took salary from Gitcoin Holdings). The total burn on Gitcoin Holdings in the last 8 months has never been more than $5k/mo (covering costs like Slack, Typeform, and Airtable).     owocki:      cryptowanderer:  This implication is false. KERNEL has been cash-positive since Genesis Block.   Based on my conversations with Vivek that are focused on financial scarcity, and my own understanding of the financials - I dont think thats true.   To both Kevin & Andy\u2019s points, during those eight months, we have survived almost entirely on the KERNEL Multisig, which includes a) money generated via KERNEL past Blocks and b) Gitcoin Grants rounds (this does not include any inflows from large one time donations from Gitcoin Holdings). We are cash flow positive during KERNEL Blocks, and the multisig has held us over between blocks as well well as legal things play their due course. At maintenance levels, even with our empty KERNEL Block 6 and no fundraise, KERNEL will be fine for another 4 months with the multisig. We will not disappear if this proposal does not pass and KB6 & KB7 will happen. However, fundraising $2-3MM for a long winter, and doing so via a web3 native fundraise allows us to move beyond \u2018maintenance\u2019 for a project that, contrary to what this forum may feel like, is very clearly growing in a healthy way. We can do work we otherwise couldn\u2019t with this more support, much of which has been described above. Starting that fundraise with GitcoinDAO (at 49K GTC this season), especially given the context, seemed a logical start. We never would have gotten there if it weren\u2019t for the 14 months prior, where KERNEL was, with 3-4 employees, funded entirely by Gitcoin Holdings. Upon this basis, we reached an agreement for it\u2019s spinout into it\u2019s own entity to explore it\u2019s own pluralistic future (will return here), though we knew it would always be intertwined with Gitcoin - starting with Holdings and ideally, with GitcoinDAO.     owocki:   Learn to fundraise outside of Gitcoin/GitcoinDAO.    The biggest difference in opinion here seems to this: what is the difference between fundraising from Gitcoin Holdings and GitcoinDAO? Is it, in this scenario, \u2018double dipping\u2019, or are the asks to two different entities that operate with different mandates? There are obviously similarities, but what is different? More specifically, what does this GitcoinDAO treasury represent? Is it meant for furthering efforts coming from Gitcoin Holdings, or also for other projects which build with more pluralistic intents? How does the DAO balance these two important categories at an early stage and over time? In my imperfect role as COO of Gitcoin, I once quoted a paper in a Gitcoin discourse called Liberal Radicalism. Kevin had recently launched Gitcoin Grants v1 with a much smaller team and quadratic funding, from that paper, helped bring it to life. Today, I will quote the more recent Decentralized Society, by Puja Ohlhaver, Glen Weyl, and Vitalik Buterin.  We call this richer, pluralistic ecosystem \u201cDecentralized Society\u201d (DeSoc)\u2014a co-determined sociality, where Souls and communities come together bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to co-create plural network goods and intelligences, at a range of scales. Key to this sociality is decomposable property rights and enhanced governance mechanisms that reward trust and cooperation while protecting networks from capture, extraction, and domination.   With such augmented sociality, web3 can eschew today\u2019s hyper-finanancialization in favor of a more transformative, pluralist future of increasing returns across social distance.  While KERNEL is not one of \u2018Gitcoin\u2019s Essential Intents\u2019, and while it retains the need for some social distance, may we not find increasing returns and new worlds together? I\u2019ll explain further.     owocki:   This proposal offers nothing back to GitcoinDAO. It\u2019s essential a \u201csomething for nothing\u201d proposal. I believe that the proposal should be mutually beneficial.    While not raising venture funding and instead choosing to raise funds from web3 donors, starting with GitcoinDAO, & via our own web3 experiments, may not seem to be mutually beneficial, it actually is. Instead of GitcoinDAO\u2019s expected 24% \u2018team governance rights\u2019 in KERNEL being diluted in the same hyper-financial environment being warned against in Decentralized Society by the venture capital model, it will stay at 24%. This means that KERNEL, if it is successful, will be governed by a) it\u2019s vibrant community and b) GitcoinDAO.     krrisis:  Would still vote yes on a mutual grant proposal with deeply discussed terms.   This is why we felt KERNEL already uniquely fits between a mutual grant & a workstream at this time. (We are committed to our role as a workstream, given this proposal did fall in that category, and feel well positioned to play in it for S14 via @sidcode and myself). We sense other web3 protocols will respect and appreciate these two communities retaining the two governance voices in KERNEL, and that it\u2019s a sign of strength to have GitcoinDAO be the anchor partner. (As previously mentioned, the Nomic Labs fundraise is our example here \u2013 they went back to the Ethereum Foundation for anchor support of $8MM after having their early support since their inception, and then raised $22MM in donations successfully from protocols, DAO\u2019s, and other stakeholders. This was not a sign of weakness.) In summary, we decided to make the proposal here first because:  KERNEL is a place where mutual benefit will financially accrue to GitcoinDAO, perhaps as a home for a variety of \u2018plural network goods and intelligences\u2019 The use and norms of the GitcoinDAO treasury have long term ramifications for KERNEL and web3 in general, regardless of whether this proposal passes or not  I understand and empathize that we make this proposal in a time of immense strain. Opening the hatches in a bear market is not the suggestion we make. There are many ways in which this proposal was imperfect, perhaps most notably picking a workstream flow, although the other options for exploring funding were not so clear. We do, however, want to speak out against the precedent not funding KERNEL suggests \u2013 against a pluralist vision for the use of GitcoinDAO\u2019s treasury. Specific to Kev\u2019s points, this requires the hard position of balancing What would a Lean/Effective Gitcoin look like?  with A Vision For A Pluralistic Civilization Scale Infrastructure For Funding Public Goods? As Kevin states, more eloquently in my opinion (minus a typo or two ), in the latter:  I envision a web-scale public goods funding infrastructure replacing some of the places where nation states are receding in their support for public goods (or were never good at supporting public goods in the first place). in the old world, public goods were oriented around nation state. in the new world, they\u2019ll be based upon your online niche/community you belong to. were in the middle of a great re-indexing from nation-states to niches. niches are the new nation-states insofar as as this public goods funding spreads outward, niches (not geography) will be the aqueduct that carries the liquidity outward to the world.  KERNEL is most directly described here as a \u2018niche community\u2019 \u2013 one that is partially public, but decidedly focused on plural outcomes \u2013 \u2018helping the world by caring for KERNEL Fellows and their communities.\u2019 I do not suggest that funding all niches like KERNEL is within GitcoinDAO\u2019s mandate, but I do sense that funding a high potential \u201caqueduct\u201d for niche funding that is intertwined with the DAO and could use the support mindfully is a reasonable path forward. This can be done without requesting more governance control, though we understand the paradigm from which the suggestion comes (we respectfully decline this suggestion). It can be done by allowing many pies to grow. We are grateful that one of the KERNEL fellows we\u2019ve spent time with is @krrisis, who I can\u2019t thank enough for his words on the forum today. It has always been a joy to be with you, in Metaspace, in juntos, in firesides, and here. His words on KERNEL and on the considerations of GitcoinDAO both ring true to me and I respect his judgement however he chooses. The largest gift KERNEL has given me is a sense of security in service \u2013 that in web3, and in life, if I can find it in my heart to serve without boundaries, there will be compounding rewards and benefits. I have failed many times in this effort, and I will again. In the process, I will never find perfection, but I may find my way to good. I\u2019ll end with thoughts on the word \u2018good\u2019, which may have tangential relation to the rest of this post and what \u2018public good\u2019 might mean. From the inimitable @cryptowanderer, helped by Henry Zhu, and the special Mary Oliver:  Happily, the language of the good is also a language of self-imposed limits, which seeks perfect expression only as a means towards realizing a convivial life lived together in the golden mean. This golden mean, or middle path, is akin to the program of least complexity, because it requires no additional symbol, only a kind of rhythmic harmony; a balance of the whole.  Balanced by Mary Oliver:  You do not have to be good. You do not have to walk on your knees For a hundred miles through the desert, repenting. You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves.  I love KERNEL, and am grateful that it is my ever-moving home today and will be into the future. It will remain focused on people and poetry, even when ill placed within long governance threads (lol). We will remain amicable with GitcoinDAO regardless of outcome which intertwines with our story in a plurality of ways. We do not depend deeply on each other, but we are stronger together. I trust that the vote tomorrow will play out as it is meant to and wish you all well. ",

                    "content": "    vivek:  what is the difference between fundraising from Gitcoin Holdings and GitcoinDAO   They are two seperate entities.  One is a delaware c corp and one is a DAO with a legal structure based in Cayman.     vivek:  How does the DAO balance these two important categories at an early stage and over time?   I\u2019d encourage you to read through the governance process.  Gitcoin Holdings has gone to considerable length to seperate itself from the DAOs decision making.  There is a balance here though, as until now we\u2019ve been there to catch things when they fall over (as the recent dGrants workstream).  In the future, Holdings will likely fully dissaffiliate from the DAO and will only interact at arms length with it in order to make more clear the seperation. As to your question about focus, the workstream leads recently went through an excercise to ratify the DAOs Purpose and Essential Intent for the next 18 months.  Those are in draft form and not ratified yet.  I expect that a post will be coming about that this week.     vivek:  We sense other web3 protocols will respect and appreciate these two communities retaining the two governance voices in KERNEL, and that it\u2019s a sign of strength to have GitcoinDAO be the anchor partner.   This is where I start to get worried.  Gitcoin is already your anchor partner.  One of the terms we agreed upon in our \u201cSeeding KERNEL DAO\u201d doc was that \u201cGitcoin as Founding Donor of KERNEL\u201d. I feel that were getting into string bet territory here.  Is Gitcoin a Founding partner for KERNEL already?  Or is it dependent on this proposal passing?     vivek:  (As previously mentioned, the Nomic Labs fundraise is our example here \u2013 they went back to the Ethereum Foundation for anchor support of $8MM after having their early support since their inception, and then raised $22MM in donations successfully from protocols, DAO\u2019s, and other stakeholders. This was not a sign of weakness.)   If the DAO had the capitalization of the EF, it could fund at the levels they do.  But the DAO does not.     vivek:  Specific to Kev\u2019s points, this requires the hard position of balancing What would a Lean/Effective Gitcoin look like?  with A Vision For A Pluralistic Civilization Scale Infrastructure For Funding Public Goods?   I do not think that there is a balance to strike here.  Nowhere in the A Vision For A Pluralistic Civilization Scale Infrastructure For Funding Public Goods? post does it imply that Gitcoin would be funding these mechanisms out of it\u2019s treasury. In fact, the opposite is true.  A pluralistic infrastructure requires pluralistic funding mechanisms and sources. (Though AFAIK the DAO does intend to scale Gitcoin Grants to a point where it could fund a project like this)     vivek:  We do not depend deeply on each other, but we are stronger together   I just found out that you asked Gitcoin Holdings\u2019s lead designer to work on the KERNEL brand recently.  As you know, I have trust issues stemming from resources that Gitcoin Holdings are funding, that were supposed to be allocated to our priorities, being allocated to KERNEL\u2019s priorties - especially without my knowledge.  This feels like its an abuse of trust.  Resource misalignment has happened many times in our shared history, but I think now is a good time for it to end.  As the seperation has been finalized socially in Q3 last year, and will be legally seperated soon, I would like to ask you to stop asking full time team members at Gitcoin Holdings to work on KERNEL work, especially on Gitcoin Holding\u2019s dime. The KERNEL syllabus talks about values like \u201cConsider your intention first.\u201d.  \u201cIncentives inform everything.\u201d.  I am disappointed that these values seem to only be selectively applied, either when (1) you want something or (2) within the KERNEL alumni in-group.  You could have considered asking me before you asked our lead designer to work on KERNEL after you\u2019ve already spun out.  You could follow through on your committments after you make them.  But you chose not to, whether consciously or mindlessly, the result is the same.     vivek:  I love KERNEL, and am grateful that it is my ever-moving home today and will be into the future. It will remain focused on people and poetry, even when ill placed within long governance threads (lol).   Regardless of the wrinkles in our shared history, I am happy for you that you found your tribe and your place in the ecosystem.  And I am happy that KERNEL alumni seem to have gained so much from the program.  I know you love KERNEL because I see you pour your heart and soul into it to make it a great experience. Speaking of long governance posts:  I have empathy for KERNEL but I am against accomodating it in this proposal.  Through this conversation I\u2019ve tried to be firm but not mean - especially not unnecessarily.   My apologies in advance for if/when I stepped over this line.     vivek:  We will remain amicable with GitcoinDAO regardless of outcome which intertwines with our story in a plurality of ways\u2026   Likewise, I wish KERNEL the best and look forward to GitcoinDAO and KERNEL being more at arms length together in the DAO of DAO ecosystem.  Perhaps once the dust has settled we can define that relationship further so there are no more surprises. ",
