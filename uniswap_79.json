                    "content": "This post outlines a framework for funding regulatory and political defense of the decentralized finance ecosystem with a grant from the UNI Community Treasury. We will refer to this fund as the DeFi Defense Fund here, which can be set up as a 501(c)(4) in the US for the greatest flexibility, accountability, and benefits. The temperature check showed massive interest in the topic and almost two-thirds of the votes were in favor of moving forward. The biggest concern\u2014raised by those both voting yes and no\u2014was the lack of precise details. We planned to unveil more details in the Consensus Check as the next stage in this process, and do so here. We address the other concerns raised at the end of this post and plan to respond to concerns as they come up during this Consensus Check. This proposal is both a response to external threats and a preemptive action taken to ensure the sustainability of Uniswap\u2014and DeFi more broadly\u2014for the long-term. Decentralized finance is increasingly under regulatory scrutiny, and we need to defend the ecosystem, its democratizing potential, and its decentralization ideals. To date, decentralized non-custodial protocols have logically been exempted from regulatory obligations designed for custodial financial intermediaries. But now governments and international organizations are considering policies that may halt the innovation, expanded access, and transparency it enables. Similar organizations were essential to protecting the Internet from regulatory threats that would have destroyed the internet\u2019s potential long ago. Over the decades, legal advocates had to win the US Supreme Court case \u201cReno v. ACLU\u201d in 1996 (without which most websites would have had to verify that their viewers were over 18 and exclude minors), the Comcast-BitTorrent case in 2008 (without which the largest cable companies would have continued to block peer-to-peer protocols), the SOPA/PIPA bill in 2012 (which, had it passed, would have stifled web 2.0 by targeting platforms for user-generated content), and even the Apple-FBI case in 2015 (where the US government asserted the right to force companies to write new code for increased surveillance). Without these and other wins\u2013by lawyers, advocates, and technologists\u2013the internet could have never reached its potential. As the most prominent and successful automated market maker protocol, Uniswap will not only receive legal and political questions but also will be well-positioned to lead the defense against rushed proposals that would restrict individuals\u2019 ability to use DeFi protocols or attempt to obligate governance token holders to adopt changes that would fundamentally undermine the promise of decentralized finance. We recommend that Uniswap governance allocate funds to set up a 501(c)(4) \u201cpolicymaking machine\u201d with the goals of 1) preempting regulatory, legal, political, and tax threats to decentralized finance; 2) achieving regulatory clarity for decentralized finance and related activity; 3) advancing laws that support decentralized finance and decentralized governance; and 4) spurring other DeFi protocols\u2019 governance bodies to contribute to the effort (through this organization or their own). The DeFi Defense Fund would fund all of the following: 1) Thought leadership: we need more think tanks and academics to write policy white papers, articles, and op-eds explaining the benefits of decentralized finance; 2) Legal firepower: we need to develop strong legal arguments ahead of enforcement actions or new regulations that threaten DeFi; 3) Top advocates: we need more people directly educating legislative and regulatory policymakers about DeFi and advocating for policy positions that favor DeFi; 4) Messaging: We need to better formulate ideas, prepare spokespeople, and communicate to policymakers and the general public the promise of DeFi; 5) Grassroots advocacy: we need to make it easy for individuals who already care about DeFi to voice their opinions to Congress and regulations. Advocacy campaigns usually require a combination of all of these working in concert. Due to the importance of this work to the Uniswap community and the cost of doing this work well, we propose funding the DeFi Defense Fund with 1M UNI tokens. We expect the committee to allocate these funds over 4-5 years. Outline of this post  The regulatory threat Doing nothing is not an option The Uniswap community is best positioned to lead the effort to protect decentralized finance About the DeFi political defense organization Addressing questions raised in the Temperature Check Snap poll  The regulatory threat Governments\u2019 financial supervisory regimes are generally based on the regulation of financial intermediaries (think banks, stock exchanges, money transmitters, etc.). To date, decentralized finance protocols like the Uniswap protocol have generally been excluded from these regulatory regimes because users of the protocols retain \u201ctotal independent control\u201d over their assets and the protocols have been treated more like the Bitcoin, Ethereum, or HTTP protocols. For example, in the United States, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)\u2014the agency responsible for implementing the Bank Secrecy Act\u2014has said that when a cryptocurrency \u201c\u2026trading platform only provides a forum where buyers and sellers of [cryptocurrency] post their bids and offers and the parties themselves settle any matched transactions through an outside venue (either through individual wallets or other wallets not hosted by the trading platform), the trading platform does not qualify as a money transmitter under FinCEN regulations.\u201d This conclusion makes sense and is worth defending. Unfortunately, governments and international organizations are considering whether to move away from this relatively clear delineation of what is and is not a regulatable activity and essentially seek to \u201cshift the goal posts\u201d in order to capture decentralized finance protocols\u2014and their governance token holders\u2014as \u201cregulatable entities.\u201d For example, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international organization that aims to coordinate countries\u2019 anti-money laundering regimes, essentially suggests that decentralized finance doesn\u2019t exist at all: \u201cWhere customers can access a financial service, it stands to reason that some party has provided that financial service, even if the act of providing it was temporary or shared among multiple parties\u201d\u2014such as governance token holders. The FATF suggests also that \u201c\u2026launching a self-propelling infrastructure to offer VASP services is the same as offering them, and similarly commissioning others to build the elements of an infrastructure, is the same as building them.\u201d Switzerland is already proposing to expand the definition of money transmission to include the \u201cenabling\u201d of funds transfers\u2014even when there is no intermediary taking custody of a customer\u2019s funds\u2014and so may capture decentralized financial protocols in their financial supervisory regime (and this definition may even capture Bitcoin and Ethereum). Doing nothing is not an option \u201cIf we do nothing proactive, governments will develop proposals modeled on TradFi regulation that was developed for different systems in a different time and with wholly different risks. \u201cDoing nothing\u201d will lead to \u201cdoing ineffective, irrelevant activities mandated by regulators because they were not yet properly educated.\u201d The enormous costs of this potential future are much less likely to materialize if we invest resources in a defense fund\u2014a modest cost by comparison. If governance of DeFi protocols is to survive long term, we need to actively engage in the policymaking discussions happening right now to ensure the interests and positions of millions of DeFi users are represented. The Uniswap community is best positioned to lead the effort to protect decentralized finance Decentralized and non-custodial exchange over the internet is a net benefit to society that should be embraced by societies seeking to advance economic flourishing and individual liberty. The Uniswap protocol is universally recognized as the leading and most successful automated market maker protocol in the DeFi ecosystem. Uniswap v3 and v2 each have more volume than any other automated market maker protocol. The broader Uniswap community includes many of the crypto ecosystem\u2019s most thoughtful leaders, both institutions and individuals, and the community prioritized properly resourcing the UNI Community Treasury from day one. We have the technological leadership, community, and human and financial resources to win this policy debate over the foundational principle underlying not only automated market makers and decentralized finance, but crypto generally. About the DeFi political defense organization In light of the expense of hiring sophisticated lobbyists, lawyers, and experts, and in light of the urgent threat we see from poorly informed regulatory proposals globally, we recommend an initial infusion of 1 million UNI (less than one-quarter of one percent of the treasury). This entity will not replicate the great work of existing organizations such as Coin Center, Fight for the Future, the Blockchain Association, the Crypto Council for Innovation, the Defi Alliance, Blockchain for Europe, or others. Rather, it would fund these and other organizations to expand their capabilities to be able to more effectively protect DeFi. It would fund across areas including thought leadership, legal analysis, policy advocacy, messaging, and grassroots. Further, this fund will extend its monetary impact by conditioning some of its grants with matching by other governance treasuries, crypto foundations, or crowd-matching. Grants administration for political spending is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated, and thus we propose a grants committee overseen by an accountable entity. This committee would hire a grants-making leader or staff and create an efficient, predictable process for applicants. We propose the following as committee members, with a subset of them serving as the entity\u2019s board of directors. All have expressed their willingness to join the committee:   Jake Chervinsky, General Counsel, Compound Labs & Strategic Advisor, Variant Fund. Jake serves as general counsel at Compound Labs and as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center.  Larry Sukernik, co-founder, Reverie. Larry co-founded Reverie to steward the development of DAOs. Previously, he was an investor at Digital Currency Group.  Rebecca Rettig, General Counsel, Aave Companies. Rebecca is a well-known DeFi lawyer who has advocated before government bodies around the world. Aave is based in Europe so she can help ensure connectivity with European based groups.  Marc Boiron, General Counsel, dYdX Trading. Marc is a DeFi attorney who has designed the regulatory strategies and DAO structures for many of the leading DeFi protocols in addition to having educated regulators on DeFi.  Marvin Ammori, Chief Legal Officer of Uniswap Labs. Marvin has spent his career advocating for new technologies from the internet to DeFi. He has served as a board member of multiple advocacy nonprofits.  Katie Biber, Chief Legal Officer of Brex, Board of Directors of Anchorage. Katie is a fintech and crypto leader and political superlawyer who served as the General Counsel of the Mitt Romney presidential campaign in 2012.  Sheila Warren, World Economic Forum, Executive Committee (Cryptocurrency Lead). Sheila is trained as a lawyer who used to represent 501(c)(4) nonprofits such as Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. She now convenes experts on cryptocurrency regulatory issues at WEF.  These committee members skew towards legal advocates for their expertise in policy formation and analysis and towards US residents as the US plays an outsized role in global financial regulation. We expect that some members will be able to serve pro bono and that the total compensation across the entire committee will be less than $150K per year. Due to the dynamic and somewhat unpredictable state of global policy proposals, we believe the grant-making committee should have considerable discretion, subject to the necessary disclosure of its activities. Addressing questions raised in the Temperature Check Some concerns were raised in the Temperature Check.   Will a student group control these funds? We propose the committee named above, which includes some of the top thinkers and lawyers in DeFI across multiple top projects. In Temperature Check, several people assumed that the Harvard Law Blockchain and Fintech Initiative would control these funds, and we should have been clearer that this was never the intent of our proposal.  Why isn\u2019t the budget small? Top lawyers, lobbyists, and educational public relations campaigns are very expensive. When the US Treasury Department proposed a \u201cmidnight rulemaking\u201d in December, blockchain advocacy organizations were forced to spend millions in just a few months on agency comments and prepared litigation. Given the complexity and novelty of these issues, we need the world\u2019s best talent, and many of them are paid more than professional athletes. The committee will be best positioned to allocate these funds dynamically in response to threats and opportunities. Given the current proposals, the industry needs funding sizable enough to support the multi-front campaign on multiple issues.  Considerable transparency will be ensured. There are considerable public reporting requirements for both 501(c)(4) organizations\u2013regarding grant size and recipients\u2013and also separately for any lobbying expenditures. Further, we expect this committee (and independently others in the community) to provide plain language summaries of these disclosures. Board members of 501(c)(4) organizations are also fiduciaries required by law to act not in their own interest but in the organization\u2019s best interest.  Free-riding can be mitigated but is not worth any upfront delay. In this ecosystem, many of us get to free ride off of one another\u2019s software contributions (e.g., Uniswap governance is a fork of Compound governance, all of DeFi benefits from Ethereum development). Groups also free-ride off of policy contributions. DeFi has benefited from expensive and time-consuming efforts of Coin Center, the Ethereum Foundation, and others as they educated policy makers and defended Bitcoin and Ethereum against attacks for many years. As noted, we expect the committee over time to condition grants on matching funds raised by other affected communities. Further, more funds will be needed over time if DeFi continues to grow\u2014just as internet freedom organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation remain busy and have expanded over time\u2014and we expect other communities will contribute as they wake up to additional threats and rushed proposals targeting them directly. The need for this funding organization is too urgent to delay over negotiating free-riding concerns, and we expect those concerns to be mitigated in months, not years.  The grants would go far beyond lobbying. Nobody likes lobbyists. We get it. But to properly educate policymakers in a way that defends DeFi, the organization would provide some funding to lobbyists and more to the workstreams described above: (1) thought leadership, (2) legal firepower, (3) top policy advocates (some of whom would be \u201clobbying\u201d on specific bills and some would be more generally educational), (4) messaging, and (5) grassroots advocacy.

                    "content": "Dear HarvardLawBFI As I had commented in your twitter account before you uploaded this note here, it would be much more relevant to create a new product (we named our project for something similar DeFiDefense) that the DeFi community would potentially embrace. A great number of NFTs of this product could be distributed to the lawyers working on it (instead of actual payment). They would thus be working for and on it while creating it, and have a vivid interest in seeing it grow. The wider community would more easily accept and \u201cadopt\u201d it this way. If those working on it do not do a decent work, it will fail (along with their reward for it). Moreover, it should not be just a small group of people doing this. Rights litigators (iNGOs too) should first be well informed about it (educated) and then take part. For many reasons, which we can explain in detail. So, one point of objection is: -Why UNI? UNI (and others) could fund it, if they think it is of worth. But it would stand a far better chance if it was a distinct project. Other points are: -The lawyer\u2019s (let\u2019s call it \u201cDeFi defender\u2019s\u201d) group should be clearly distinct from the lobbying one. Lobbyists are not stricto sensu defenders. There is an issue here -if not an ethical one, then one of \u201caesthetics\u201d. -Why just US people? A group should cover many jurisdictions, and continents. Why not make it, to start with, an iNGO (that also seeks consultative status with the UN and regional monitoring mechanisms)? -Why only \u201ctechnical\u201d people in the steering group? There should be diversity. For sure, there is a strong absence of civil, political and economic rights strategic litigators in your proposal, which in my view undermines the whole proposal. It is primarily such a group that should and has, in some jurisdictions- start building up a DeFiDefense. Because it is economic freedom and related (fundamental) rights that will ultimately have to be defended. Before you tackle, legally, a technical inconsistency in a law, a new law may be enacted spoiling your litigation. It is fundamental rights\u2019 litigation -and especially on a supranational level- that may halt the governmental apetite for a coordinated suppression. You can consider this as a given. So, already, a few experienced (in litigation before the UN and supranational Courts and tribunals, because this is where the game will finally be played in case of Governmental crackdown) strategic litigators are preparing on how to respond to an imminent suppression of crypto. It will primarily be a matter of fundamental rights and it will have to take into account the consensus and adoption of DeFi, at the point this happens. However, preferably, the legal work that should be undertaken would be \u201cpreventive\u201d, quietly creating precedents in different jurisdictions, that will be hard to undo when the Governments potentially decide to crack down on DeFi. Such work is already late. -The costs you mention are extreme. Also, they should not be taken on by UNI alone, but by DeFi community more generally TIP: Harvard (Kennedy) School had a very nice course on \u201cLeading non violent movements for social change\u201d. I believe some among those who took the course would love to be engaged in \u201cpeeling the onion\u201d of resistance to the adoption of DeFi, coming up with a series of different tactics and strategies for defending DeFi in time, consolidating and mainstreaming the revolution that DeFi represents\u2026 Maybe, as Harvard students, you could discuss with the Kennedy School whether they can inform former students about the opportunity to participate in something like this. I bet many among them would engage pro bono or with minimal cost. As a strategic litigator with thousands of representations, many of which condemning different countries, also trained in system dynamics and non violence (yes, one of those you would suspect their services cost heaps of money), I inform you that I would help in any such initiative pro bono or contribute to the making of a new asset with these characteristics, as long as it respects the ethos and aims of decentralization, and as long as it leaves a clear and big space for litigating DeFi related issues as a matter of fundamental rights, and no space at all for internal or external manipulation of the community. Good luck. ",

                    "content": "Just to expand on BOR\u00b4s thoughts. Saying that 1M UNI represents only 0,25 % is misleading. The UNI treasury might seem huge when you view its value based on the marketcap, but this is extremely inaccurate estimate of what wealth the UNI treasury currently holds. The real market value what you can get from the UNI treasury is multiple times smaller. Think of it the same way as Vitalik was only able to get 38M USD for the 2B worth of coins he was donated\u2026 My point is that we do not know how much % of the firepower from the treasury this proposal would take in the end. You can say its only 0.25 % of the treasury, but the selling pressure might result in a much larger, unexpected impact. When I say there is huge opportunity cost, I have in mind the fact that we already have a proposal which exerts selling pressure on the UNI token\u00b4s price. If we add another one which is 20x larger, we might NOT enough room for additional proposals which have inherent selling pressure built into them because the price impact will start being very very palpable. Therefore, I\u00b4d much rather support many more proposals which build on top of Uniswap and want funding to improve it rather than to throw it away on lawyers which is not our sole responsibility anyway. Who said Uniswap has to be the lawyer of DeFi? ",

It\u2019s for the benefit of the entire Crypto space.  Some of the people assisting include Compound Labs DYDX Aave.  That\u2019s good.  But the proposal should be brought to a governance vote for all of these other major protocols (Aave DYDX Compound Maker Yearn) to vote to equally participate in this effort.   If it passes for all i\u2019d be open to supporting it for uni if not then I don\u2019t support it. Also, with the deal making that goes on in politics I\u2019d hate to see photo-ops or press releases showing UNI support based on this initiative for some legislative measure that represents a compromise to what many people think the law should be. Finally, what issues/gaps need to be filled that the other associations you reference  (Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, etc.) aren\u2019t already addressing?  I understand you\u2019d support them but you also mention other organizations.  How much financial support are these other organizations getting from other companies compared to what you\u2019re asking UNI to allocate?  (total figure not just percentage).   Where/how did you come up with 1 mill UNI?  It sounds like a one time allocation that you \u201cexpect to be allocated over 4-5 years.\u201d  Why do you need upfront funding for 4-5 years as opposed to getting a smaller allocation at first?  Then, we can see what you\u2019ve been working towards and then you can come back to the community for another vote for more funds every year. ",

                    "content": "I will probably vote against this proposal for the following reasons.  Budget / Proof of work For the current stage of this project, I believe the budget is exorbitantly high. Before supporting a proposal of this scale, I think it would be worth seeing a lot more proof of work. A classic lesson from startup investing or even the early ICO era is that projects should be funded in correlation to their progress thus far, then given more funding as they prove their ability to use the capital to fuel success. This project requests a massive lump sum of cash despite not having done significant work besides writing a proposal.  Reassessment and evaluation The Uniswap Grants Program was initially funded for only 2 quarters, and subject to reassessment and renewal after that amount of time. For a program with 10x the budget, I\u2019d expect to see the same: evaluation after some initial period to determine if this is a success worth continuing. I think it would make a lot more sense to move forward with a structure similar to the beginning of the Uniswap Grants Program: provide a smaller initial budget to fund this work for 2 quarters, then fund it at a larger scale based on the progress up to that point. Additionally, this proposal anticipates that these funds will be allocated over 4-5 years, but there is no formal structure in that regard. Even with full approval, I\u2019d hope to see these funds distributed over time, not sent all at once.  Team structure and payment This proposal anticipates that the compensation across the entire committee combined will not exceed $150K, and the proposal positions this as a benefit. I see this as a huge weakness. In my experience, committees and multi-sig wallets can experience coordination problems when signers are not properly incentivized to participate. In the case of this proposal, I believe the problem is compounded by the fact that most members of this committee have demanding full-time roles that demand their attention, and where they are paid and assessed by their organization. For me to support this proposal, I\u2019d prefer to see a different team structure. First, I would like to see at least one full-time, paid lead of this committee who is responsible for organizing and building consensus when funds need to be allocated. Second, I\u2019d actually prefer to swap out some members for legal experts who have more time on their hands to dedicate to this effort. It\u2019s hard for me to imagine that people with some of the roles above will have the spare time available to read applications, evaluate talent, and allocate $27M dollars worth of funds effectively.  Team buy-in The proposal states that all of the members listed have expressed their willingness to be on this committee. Do they actually want to be on the committee? What\u2019s their level of excitement? I\u2019d like to see every member of this committee commenting here on the forums and describing their motivations and plans for this group. Again, a committee with 1M UNI worth of funds should consist of members who are determined to use that capital effectively. For me, it would also be helpful to see writing or other work these members have done related to DeFi\u2019s legal defense.  Conclusion These are my initial concerns with this proposal. I believe there are significant structural changes that should be made before this moves forward. ",

We understand that $30M is not insignificant. As mentioned above, we anticipate that this will be allocated over 4-5 years. However, we think this amount is necessary up front in the event of emergencies. We want to impress upon you the urgency of this situation. Right now, if regulators decide to take action, we are left with very few options. Governance will not be able to react quickly enough to alleviate misguided action. We have seen how rash and quickly regluators can act (i.e., midnight Bitcoin rulemaking a few months ago). And once laws are set in motion, it becomes astronomically more difficult to change them later. With a fund set aside to protect us, the board will be able to react swiftly and appropriately.  To address a tangential concern here, the board is excited and extremely supportive of this proposal. For example, see Jake Chervinsky\u2019s tweet. We anticipate you will be able to hear more of their specific thoughts soon.  We actually 100% agree that Uniswap shouldn\u2019t need to pay for DeFi defense on their own. However, given the urgency of the situation, waiting to coordinate all platforms at once would be a mistake. We will get to work on it ASAP, but in the meantime having something that can be used is better than being emptyhanded.  Furthermore, this Uniswap board can and will condition the release of these funds on matching contributions from other platforms. For example, if the board decides to fund a project, they can condition their contribution on recieving a commensurate amount from other platforms that will benefit from their action. One of our board members is the Chief Legal Officer of Uniswap (Marvin Ammori), and as someone primarily interested in the success of Uniswap, he would not allow freeriding beyond what is necessary. Lastly, we can always adjust after the fact. We think given the urgency of the situation it is best to get funds in the hands of people who can protect us as quickly as possible, and adjust as needed going forward. We are trying to address as many concerns as we can, and we appreciate your participation. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the thoughtful comments, @jcp. I\u2019ll address of few of your points and wrap into it some thoughts on other points laid out in responses above: 1. Payment and Commitment Each member of the committee was asked whether he or she would like to participate as a member of the committee with an understanding of the time commitment and responsibilities. Speaking only for myself, the issues that this proposal seeks to address are issues that I deal with on a daily basis, whether in my job as General Counsel of dYdX or voluntarily because of the impact the current regulatory status has on the space. That eliminates the time commitment that it would take to understand the issues. Instead, the time commitment is one that would involve assisting with the proper formation of a 501(c)(4) in addition to properly evaluating uses of funds based on the knowledge that I have and continue to acquire on a daily basis. Thus, while the time commitment is meaningful, my job supplements it in a way that reduces the time commitment as compared to many others who could be part of the committee. The same is true for many, if not all, committee members. Similarly, getting paid would not change my time commitment as these are issues that are important to me personally as someone who wants to see DeFi grow without the regulatory burdens that have existed and continue to get worse in addition to as General Counsel of a DeFi company who wants to see companies developing DeFi protocols able to do so without the current risks and lack of clarity that exists. 2. Budget / Proof of Work A request for what is currently $30M is significant. It is very difficult to determine an appropriate budget at the outset but it is clear is that a smaller amount like $5M would not cut it. The scope of the regulatory/political matters that need to be addressed in DeFi is significant. Not only are we talking about risks in US securities laws, commodities laws, AML laws, the OFAC sanctions regime, banking laws, lending laws, and consumer protection laws, we are facing the same risks outside of the US. In some cases, those efforts are coordinated across the US and internationally, such as with FATF. There are other regulatory regimes where that coordination is happening as well but privately. Addressing these issues is no small task and, frankly, requires a war chest. I\u2019m sympathetic to a potential request for a smaller amount than $40M but that will curtail potential efforts, which are multi-year efforts (more on that point below). 3. Reassessment and Evaluation The efforts that the political defense organization would undertake will not be something that can be assessed over a short time period. Likely the shortest time period to see a real impact, that can be objectively measured, is over a 2-year time period. Certainly, there may be small wins in the meantime, but it would be difficult to measure the success of the organization over less than a 2-year period. So, the question then is whether a reassessment should exist following a period of 2 years or more. That would be a reasonable position to take. I think the proposal contemplates the fact that these types of political/regulatory efforts play out over a long period of time and in a fluid and continuous fashion. It is much harder to scope out small uses of funds for clear deliverables as is the case with the Uniswap Grants Program. Ultimately, this point is a reasonable one that I sympathize with while also understanding the purpose of a commitment that is to be used over 4-5 years. 4. Other Projects As the proposal outlines, the hope is that other projects will participate in this effort. But, if Uniswap, the most well-funded and best-recognized project in the space, does not show a commitment to it, then it is very difficult to receive a commitment from other projects. Although I\u2019m not sure anyone is in a position to ensure other projects will commit to this effort, I\u2019m quite confident other projects will attempt to participate in these efforts as it is in the best interest of all of DeFi. With other projects requiring similar proposals to be passed, it is impossible to obtain certainty at this stage that the other projects will be able to successfully pass a proposal. If we wait for them to pass proposals, then we\u2019ll have a chicken and egg situation. One project needs to be the first to commit and hopefully bring the others along, and I believe Uniswap is best positioned and likely has the greatest interest in creating an organization of this nature. 5. Motives Several posts as part of the Temperature Check and here as part of the Consensus Check appear to question the motives of those involved in the proposal or that funds may be used in a way that does not further the objectives set forth in the proposal. First, the proposer, @HarvardLawBFI, will not be receiving any benefit or influence (and the same is true for Harvard itself) from the proposal. I do not see anything in the proposal that even hints at that possibility. Second, the proposal contemplates that a 501(c)(4) be established. To establish a 501(c)(4) a specific purpose needs to be identified and that purpose has been outlined in the proposal (though I suppose the precise language could differ in some ways without changing the gist of it). Once that purpose is specified, board members have a duty to act with care and in the best interest of the organization and remain loyal to its purpose, as opposed to acting in their own interest. So, board members would be exposing themselves to a real risk of liability if they misuse the funds. Lastly, no single board member could take any action on behalf of the organization and I think it is fair to say that, objectively speaking, the board members are incentivized the use the funds in the way it is outlined in the post. In sum, no proposal is perfect. The DeFi community as a whole faces significant regulatory risks, which include risks as users and token holders, that most people just aren\u2019t able to identify and, thus, do not appreciate. There currently are no major efforts to protect DeFi against regulators and incumbents\u2019 political efforts, which puts DeFi participants and projects at a huge disadvantage against those regulators and incumbents. While some believe that DeFi can survive regulatory and political attacks, I do not believe that is true for most DeFi projects at this time and, for those that can survive it, there will be a significant impact on users and those governing projects.

This proposal was broached on the community not long ago.  It could just as quickly be brought up with the other major protocols. ",

Budget // Reassessment and Evaluation I completely agree with your take about startup funding needing to be milestone-based. The proposal, however, isn\u2019t to form a startup. Rather, it\u2019s to form a non-profit entity that engages in funding research, individuals, and entities that assist in protecting defi from regulatory uncertainty. In short, I don\u2019t think traditional startup wisdom directly applies here. I don\u2019t have a sense for what the \u201cright\u201d amount of funding for this organization is, but I suspect it will be an amount far larger than what we think it should be. It\u2019s possible I\u2019m overestimating the cost, but on this front, I believe it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry \u2014 if the difference between success and failure is funding, then we should go with the conservative number: 1M UNI. Team Structure and Payment // Team Buy-In I mostly agree here \u2014 people tend to do better work when they\u2019re motivated, and fair, performance-based compensation is a good motivator for most people. That said, I don\u2019t think this group is \u201cmost people.\u201d We\u2019re all intrinsically motivated to make defi work in a compliant and regulatory-friendly way, and many of us share a mutual destiny on that front. Reverie, for example, is a company I formed with @derek to work with DAOs. But doing so hasn\u2019t been easy, mostly for legal and tax reasons. I am extremely motivated to be on this committee \u2014 even with no compensation \u2014 because it directly benefits the work Reverie and other DAO contributors do. What I also like is every member on this committee has significant skin in the game, which in my mind, is the best membership qualifier. The inverse would be far worse: a committee of individuals who sit on the committee primarily for compensation, suffering no downside risk and capturing all of the upside! Finally, I think having a full-time committee member is an excellent idea. My sense is we can probably form the committee without a full-time member and then recruit/find one if the organization needs to ramp beyond the capacity of the existing part-time structure. ",

The group proposed here can speak on different area\u2019s of the Defi space and ethereum, while also creating bridges to the traditional finance space. In May (just last month) Michael Hsu was appointed by Janet Yellen as acting OCC (office of the comptroller of the currency) and is a former associate director in supervision and regulation at the federal reserve of governors. He has made remarks of fintech and digital currencies reminding him of the pre-2008 financial crises, has created a sprint team to work on regulating digital tokens, and has designated it his appointment focus, while leaving wall street and tradFi alone. I trust the nominee\u2019s designated out in this proposal to be better advocates and more knowledgeable about the potential of the Ethereum ecosystem, than those \u201csprinting\u201d to regulate a nascent technology.

Hopefully voters do the right thing and vote this down HARD. Again, the only thing we should be pushing for is NO regulation at all for at least 10 years.

There is no check-in with governance to assess progress and request more funds.   This should not JUST be funded by Uniswap governance. This is essentially a public good for DeFi and I believe any DeFi protocol that wants to considered as a leader in this space should be expected to contribute.   What I like about this proposal:   The authors are dreaming big! For months I\u2019ve heard people say \u201cUniswap has xxx huge treasury, what should they do with it?\u201d, this is 1). big thinking, 2). legitimately needed and 3) backed by the right people.   The amount of UNI being requested is not crazy. The request is for 1 million UNI, let\u2019s remember the initial liquidity mining rewards were 5 million. Typically, DeFi WAY over pays for capital and way underpays for everything else. If we are willing to give 5 million UNI to people farming and selling the token why is 1 million for ensuring the perpetuity of the industry crazy?   The committee is very solid. People who are questioning the integrity or alignment of this group have not been in DeFi very long.   I believe this proposal is needed. I can\u2019t post links or images here but look at Jake Chervinsky comments on it (proposed committee member and Compound Labs GC). Jake said,    \u201cThe days of DeFi flying under the radar are over. Policymakers worldwide are paying attention. Now\u2019s the time to allocate resources to education & advocacy, & this is the right way to do it.\u201d  Let\u2019s read between the lines here. It\u2019s safe to assume Jake knows a lot of public and non-public information about the regulatory environment surrounding DeFi. Jake isn\u2019t prone to hyperbole. He isn\u2019t saying \u201cthe days are coming to an end\u201d he is saying, \u201cit\u2019s over\u201d. Right now our risk with this proposal is probably that it is too late not too soon. Also, Uniswap GC is on the committee, do you think they would\u2019ve joined if they felt this wasn\u2019t needed? Summary: I\u2019ll vote for the proposal. I\u2019d like to see the proposal adjusted to include:  commitments from the other leading DeFi protocols some sort of check-in before the full 1 million allocation is disbursed  But even absent those changes I would still support this on the grounds above.

I am certain none of the choices were made based off nepotism, and I am sure they are the \u201cbest lobbyists.\u201d But why even open ourselves to that criticism? Not even to be cynical, very likely these people are extremely effective at their jobs but it looks to be very clear what is happening. Winners and losers will be picked from the Wild West that is DeFi. This is simply a bribe to the right people who know how to effectively lubricate the system. No one knows the gears and levers of Washington more than people from the Bush/Cheney Admin (omitted from Biber\u2019s bio). The Whales and VCs who are on the Taxman\u2019s chopping block will obviously support this because they need the clarity. I think the \u201clittle guy\u201d will continue to pursue a more pure form of DeFi through alternative means if possible. Honestly I am seeing more merit to this proposal after it has been fleshed out, but I would want some way for the community to have a voice. Or at least some reporting method where feedback could be gathered so our interests are actually being represented. ",

I\u2019m in full agreement with Leighton here. I\u2019m voting FOR, but question for those voting against, would it be more palatable if there were a milestone set in place where only 25-50% is disbursed by treasury upfront to set up the 501(c)(4) and getting things off the ground? For getting other DeFi treasuries onboard, while I think this is a super important precedent to set, I don\u2019t want to downplay how difficult this type of coordination across decentralized communities is. This could be a prereq for future disbursement (eg. remaining 50-75%) but we should be acutely aware of the coordination costs (eg. time and effort) as well as judgement/curation (eg. who decides who gets to belong?). This has been great discourse so far, but let\u2019s be careful not to devolve into namecalling and non sequiturs to detract from the overall goals of this proposal. ",

But I\u2019m worried that the supporters and commenters above are rallying support for the general idea rather than this specific implementation. Most of my pushback here is around how this will be executed if passed, and I don\u2019t think the points I posted above have been adequately addressed. On the funding side, it\u2019s true that funding a non-profit is not the same as funding a startup or even a grant. However, the idea of accountability and assessment applies to any kind of organization. It\u2019s very possible for us to approve a budget and fund it one year at a time while getting progress updates on the work being done by this committee. I think anyone planning on starting an effective non-profit would be comfortable with that process. My biggest concern here is actually coordination, and I think the risk here is being underestimated. I\u2019ve seen many multi-sig wallets and committees fall victim to sluggish movement and lack of attention by their members, even when those members were prominent DeFi founders and employees. There\u2019s always an initial excitement to get funding and become a signer, but several weeks later, it becomes burdensome even just to gather signatures for a single transaction. The reality is that busy people will experience an attention deficit when forced to do multiple demanding jobs at once, and that\u2019s my main concern here. One remedy is to appoint a full-time member of this committee whose job it is to manage the overhead of evaluating funding applications, documenting decisions, and coordinating consensus with other members. Another safeguard would be to get a commitment from each member of this committee that they will not join any other similar committees over the next 4 years to ensure that they have enough attention for this work. The red flag for me is that over 24 hours into this proposal and after much discussion, no one on this committee besides Larry and Marc has posted their thoughts or participated in this discussion. I actually wonder if some members of the committee have read the comments here. This is a practical concern. If you can\u2019t make the effort to participate in proposal discussion when you stand to gain $40M of funding, will you make the effort 2 years into this committee, when the workload of evaluating grants has increased tenfold? Or when there\u2019s a multi-year bear market that makes other opportunities look more exciting? I agree with all the supporters above that generally, it\u2019s a great idea to use treasury funds to defend the DeFi industry. It\u2019s worth spending a lot of money to do so, and we should keep proposing things here until something like this happens. But my primary concern is making sure that if we do this, we all but guarantee that the funds we allocate are used effectively. I think it makes sense to build that into the structure of this committee. I stand by my recommendations above and am voting against this proposal unless several of these changes are made. ",

In fact, the consensus check was created with little time for discussion or debate. The primary argument against the proposal was that the sum requested, ~$30m, was outlandish. This has not been addressed, justified, or budgeted for IMO. Allocating ~$30m based on this process, to date, signals that there are no safeguards to the Uniswap treasury, and that it can be spent on a short notice, with little discussion and few details; setting a precedent that weakens Uniswap long-term.  I strongly believe that a smaller proposal ($1-2m?) should establish the political defense organization, build a team, pilot its activities, and demonstrate success, before requesting additional resources.

                    "content": "I believe it is important that everyone recognizes the significance of this proposal. If you\u2019re here in this forum, you most likely agree with the following:  DeFi holds great promise to reshape finance for the better. DAOs represent a new form of social organization that has the potential to improve upon the shortcomings of previous ones, i.e. corporations and nation state governments.  Despite recent success (technological breakthroughs, financial gain, and social adoption), both of the concepts mentioned above face an existential threat in the form of bad regulation driven by misinformed or corrupted governments. As DeFi DAO participants, UNI holders are being called on to spend a large amount of UNI from its treasury to mount a defense against this threat. Indeed, the significance of that in itself should not be ignored: I don\u2019t think it is melodramatic to suggest that, should this proposal pass, this is an event that could one day be marked down as a pivotal event in the history of DAOs. I agree with @Leighton that this is the type of \u201cbig idea\u201d that this community should be willing to pay for and I join him and others in support of this proposal. Personally, I believe some of the concerns that others have expressed and that I mentioned in my post in the Temperature Check discussion (I made a new account as to make it clear that I\u2019m speaking on my personal behalf and it won\u2019t let me link\u2026) have been adequately addressed:   Accountability and Transparency: DAOs value accountability and transparency, as is reflected in the structure of the several Community Grants committees that have sprouted up recently across DeFi. Yet, the nature of what is being proposed here does not lend itself as easily to such a funding structure. As Marc Boiron aptly points out, the feedback loops with political and legal advocacy play out over longer time periods than software development. Moreover, in the case of lobbying, for example, sometimes confidentiality is needed. We shouldn\u2019t ignore the structural accountability and transparency afforded by 501(c)4s, despite it not looking and feeling cryptonative. In addition, this Consensus Check proposal commits the committee to \u201cprovide plain language summaries of [the] disclosures\u201d required by 501(c)4\u2019s. I encourage the proposed committee to commit to semi-regular community calls, regular engagement in forums like these regarding actions that have been taken, and quarterly reports of some kind - all of which should be expected from an organization dedicated to championing DAOs to policymakers.  Buy-In from Other DAOs: Though I would have preferred simultaneous governance proposals across the other leading DeFi DAOs, the makeup of the committee and the proposers\u2019 comments in this forum (\u201cthis Uniswap board can and will condition the release of these funds on matching contributions from other platforms\u201d) indicate that other DAOs will be engaged. This is promising.  I encourage others to vote to allocate the requested funds so that we can rise to the occasion and dedicate the resources needed to defend the very idea of DeFi and DAOs. It would be hard be to draft a better committee than the one proposed here. I hope they take some of these objections made by others, such as @JCP and Robert Leshner, to heart and try to implement solutions to assuage the underlying concerns in both the final crafting of this proposal and the administration of the organization that comes out of it. With regard to administration of the organization, I encourage the Committee to strive to experiment with cryptonative tools and traditions as much as possible; if only for the reason that an organization advocating for crypto should want to showcase its potential. Some ideas:  Though certain aspects of the DeFi Defense Fund are not easily fit into a Grants Committee-like structure, others might. For example, why not experiment with direct community feedback about funding thought leadership or other smaller dollar projects that may contribute to the cause? It would be relatively straightforward to enable UNI holders (or the broader community) to vote on ideas like these. The rules for which can be customized as to maximize efficiency and not slow down the broader effort. Related, maybe the Fund could seed crowdfunded campaigns on Mirror for thought leadership. Grassroots advocacy in particular can lend itself well to this type of experimentation. For example, those who contact their representatives could be rewarded with NFTs to show their participation and \u201cpower users\u201d can develop reputation scores as advocates.  I\u2019m excited by this proposal and hope that the DeFi Defense Fund is able to both rise to the challenge we face and live up to its potential as a bridge between policymakers and the DeFi community. Thank you to all those who have engaged constructively in the debate here, it\u2019s been fun to watch unfold. ",

                    "content": "@rleshner @haydenadams  I am posting here a modified version of what I posted in the Temperature Check group because I believe it is critical for us to advocate for DeFi \u2013 but the proposal has some enormous drawbacks. Here are the key ones: 1. The budget is 10x more than any other crypto player has needed to deal with similar threats.  Where will all this money go? 2. The proposal lacks a clear goal, measurable interim objectives and clear criteria for success.. When coupled with a budget that is 10x what other companies have found necessary, where do we actually believe the money will go? 3. The board is not composed of the sort of people we can expect to best advocate for us.  It needs to be expanded to include more gray suits and fewer Twitter KOLs..  The problem here is credibility with the government, and the unfortunate aversion to PR and conflicts of interest we will likely encounter when we engage the government. My Background Before unpacking what I wrote, I wanted to share a little bit of my background without outing myself. In short, I have helped several overseas crypto, fintech and tradfi businesses navigate the halls of DC.  In most cases, the situation was far more dire than what Uniswap faces.  For example, a company may have been facing enforcement for sanctions violations or money laundering issues. In each of these cases, the company resolved the matters and began a regulatory engagement effort. The Big Picture Taking affirmative action like HLSBFI proposes is critically important so that Uniswap and other members of the DeFi industry can avoid the sorts of issues I\u2019ve seen companies face, and instead build a base of advocates with shared interests.  This takes time - and, yes, it takes money, too. Thinking carefully about how to do this is important - and it does require big brains and big connections. Unfortunately there are at least 3 key issues with the proposal in its current form.  They make me a hard no, and I believe they ought to make you a hard no, too. 1. Budget Size is 10x too large. I believe the budget size is about 10x too large because I\u2019ve personally interviewed and hired lobbyists and law firms in DC to attack similar issues with a budget of less than $500k. This was easily achievable because almost every lobbying shop or law firm will offer a package deal for under $100k per year. These \u201clow\u201d rates are possible because the lawyers and lobbyists are already doing most of the work for other clients.  In fact, most large Wall Street and DC shops will offer package deals as low as $25k per year. To right size, I believe Coin Center\u2019s entire operating budget was historically about $1m per year.  It\u2019s lobbying budget was smaller. So, what would be done with $5-10m per year? Which brings me to the next issue\u2026 2. Lack of Concrete Goals, Measurable Milestones and Definition of Success When budgeting money for a project, it usually makes sense to set clear overarching goals, create measurable objectives and to define criteria for success.  That is especially important when the budget is so large ($30m is more than it took build Uniswap, plus Sushiswap, plus Compound \u2026 ) To use an example framework (OKRs): Objective: Advance awareness of DeFi in DC and begin to identify shared interests Key Result 1: Drive awareness of Defi by scheduling meetings with the offices of 10 senators and 15 congressman.  Budget: 0 Key Result 2:  Identify shared interested between the industry and the offices of 10 politicians who appear open to collaboration during initial reachouts.  Budget: $5k Key Result 3: Identify 5 most promising targets from follow-ups to seek further collaboration.  Begin discussing ways to work together on shared interests.  Budget: $5k Key Result 4: Engage K Street shop to help guide dialogues with targets.  Budget: $10k Definition of Success: All key results completed and group has decided on draft engagement proposals for the next quarter Unfortunately, the proposal provides none of this colour right now, so it effectively implies that the money can go anywhere. In addition, this lack of discipline is what allows the request to be so large!  What would the budget look like if we started at zero - and built up each key goal line by line? 3. Board Composition The board\u2019s composition is self-defeating because it mostly comprises Crypto Twitter KOLs.  Although I imagine they are well intentioned, they just don\u2019t give the right optics to most regulators. To see this, just imagine that you are a regulator who is charged with enforcing a US sanctions program or runs a group in homeland security.  How would you perceive  a Crypto Twitter lawyer who is proclaiming how you should be doing your job what the law should be, is consistently PRing himself is advocating for the creation of a $30m lobbying fund that he directs \u2026  while you, the hardworking regulator, are given an impossible mandate, a tiny budget, and are afraid to even accept a free lunch? The standard way to solve this is to stack your organization with revolving door operators who understand how the beast works, and have reputational skin in the game and maintain a relatively low, and conflict-free profile. For us, I\u2019d recommend adjusting the composition of the board to include at most 2 Crypto Twitter lawyers and otherwise grey suits.  This will dramatically increase our credibility. ",

                    "content": "Circling back to my point about proof of work and transparency. A few people have stated that this kind of work has longer feedback loops, and that it would be hard to prove success before several years have passed. I want to push back against this by pointing out that it\u2019s not so hard to create a slightly more structured roadmap, fund a few initiatives, and then simply report on that progress. Even that level of work and reporting would be better than nothing, and enough to show effective management. Though people have mentioned above that DAOs and non-profits have transparency built into their structure, I\u2019d prefer to get some of that transparency and reporting before funding an organization with $40M. Strong agreement with @berlemeans surrounding his point #2. Additionally, even though I\u2019m not an expert on costs here, I think his points on costs are worth noting. Most importantly, I echo @rleshner\u2019s concern regarding the precedent set here if this goes to formal proposal and passes a vote in the next week or so. To pass this so quickly despite how many specific concerns have been brought up would prove that the UNI treasury can be spent on short notice by any group with brand names and a directionally correct big idea. Many people above are stating that this is the general kind of thing we should be funding, and then leaping to the conclusion that it\u2019s time to fund this right now, before addressing the details. However, the details really matter here, and we want to get this right. If there were 3 separate groups all proposing the same thing, we\u2019d obviously start comparing the details of their plans. But for some reason, since there\u2019s only one proposal for this general idea, many have decided it\u2019s time to pass it right away. My sense from this thread is that everyone agrees this kind of committee is worth funding. In addition, everyone seems to agree that the members of this committee are some of the most qualified to do so. Therefore, it seems like the next step would be collaboratively hammering out some of these details before moving to a formal Yes/No vote. With just a few more weeks of work to address the top concerns above and come up with a detailed plan that accounts for them, I\u2019m confident we could get to a place where many of the No votes become Yes votes. But to pass this in the current state feels really premature, and detrimental to Uniswap governance by means of the precedents it sets. ",

So I wonder whats next? What will be the next big proposals that whales will push through? Perhaps it will allocate 50M UNI ASAP without proper clarity, rhyme or reason to some cause which benefits a wide variety of actors having Uniswap pay for it. The saddest part about all of this is that the core idea of the proposal is good and valid, but the budget part is NOT. And it could be easily solved by having first a smaller amount of UNI allocated. When we see results, the governance can approve a bigger funding round\u2026 ",

Why is an intermediary needed to just hold and re-allocate the funds? Why cannot UNISWAP fund lobbying and legal defense activities directly, upon proposal of a committee trusted by the Community and/or via its Grants? I am not familiarized with US tax law, but have good experience with non profits in Europe, having helped dozens get instituted and properly registered. A quick look at the applicable legal framework, though, raises questions. Proxy Tax Tax Exempt Organization Fails to Notify Members that Dues Are Non Deductible Lobbying Political Expenditures | Internal Revenue Service In my view, it would be optimal that any non profit related to Uniswap be rather \u201cpoor\u201d and have an enhanced, but purely consultative and not decisive role about where expenses for political and legal defense go. Uniswap could then allocate sums directly where needed. Political and legal defense are necessary. Including (and primarily) preventive political and legal work to protect DeFi from disproportionate interference and regulation. This is the only thing there seems to be consensus on. Therefore a fund for an expert impact assessment of how this can be done in an optimal manner should precede the 1M Uni (or whatever sum) proposal for a non profit with a fixed BD which would attempt to influence \u201cthe right\u201d regulation in the US (btw, not everyone agrees there should be any intense mobilisation to initiate -any- DeFi regulation at this point).

This leads to the key problem you study in a law school corporations class: how do you regulate the actions of the board (and management) when they are not the owners of the company, and can potentially do things that help themselves, but screw the shareholders? Usually, the ** bedrock principal is that the board should act on behalf of the owners.  In fact, it has fiduciary duties to act that way under Delaware and most state corporate laws.** Most of the case law you study revolves around this issue.  For example, if the chairman of the board wants to take the company private, how do you set up the process?  Or, if a member of the board wants the company to do a deal with a related party, how do you regulate that? The usual answer is through hard and soft regulation, including forming a special committee that does not include the interested board member, securing fairness opinions from banks and accounting firms, and following a number of protective processes to prevent abuse. For a governance token, this is probably supposed to play out with the members of the DAO or the management listening to what the governance token holders direct. So, what is going on here? [Removed picture of HLSBFI saying on Twitter that regulators won\u2019t listen to token holders\u2026and positioning themselves as who regulators will listen to] What is my governance token worth \u2026 \u2026 if an interested party can propose and lead the vote to take funds from the treasury? \u2026 if the people who are directing the funds are opening saying the government will not listen to me - when they they are supposed to work on behalf of me, as a governance token holder?\" Let\u2019s get real @haydenadams. Does HLS Block Fi work for Uniswap governance token holders?  Uniswap equity holders?  Or for themselves? How about after 1m Uni are drained from the Uniswap treasury and placed in a separate fund that none of us (including you) have any control over, and is proposed to be created with literally no governance? This would stink to high heaven under Delaware corporate law.  And HLSBFI surely knows this. Why is it OK here?  And what are my \u201cgovernance\u201d tokens worth? My very honest answer is \u201cnot much\u201d if a delegated voter and a block of interested parties can lead the charge to exit a big chunk of the treasury \u2026  into a separate legal entity with no accountability to the governance token holders pay themselves and their related parties salaries hand out grants with no accountability to the project pursue an agenda that they have EXPLICITLY stated is industry-wide (not related to the project) openly state that the money will be spent to influence people who will not listen to our wants (which pretty directly implies they are not going to be acting on our behalf)  ",

                    "content": "I\u2019m Marvin Ammori, the CLO of Uniswap Labs. Since other committee members have commented somewhere publicly now, I figured I would add my voice. For background, I spent much of my early career as a lawyer fighting for internet freedom and a more decentralized web. I lived in DC for over a decade and was privileged to work on many of the signature internet freedom cases of the era, including the net neutrality fights, some privacy and encryption fights, and some of the copyright/web 2.0 fights. And, while 20/20 hindsight is strong, the truth is we could have lost many of those fights over the internet\u2019s future and were overwhelmingly expected to. But we won most of them. So I saw what it takes to win. In many of these campaigns, I would help quarterback, direct, and allocate funds and resources. I even worked alongside some of the legendary engineers who helped design the initial internet protocols and across party and national lines. I have worked on policy more than most lawyers and on a bigger stage. I have put in 10,000 hours (twice over) on shaping policy and educating policy makers usually against long odds. It doesn\u2019t mean I know everything, but it does mean I learned at least a few things the hard way. And I try to apply that every day in what I do now alongside this incredible community. A lot of policymaking is surprising, counterintuitive, and completely bizarre. I understand why some people are confused. I also understand why people, like Matt Corva at Consensys, who have devoted so much time over five years in the policy arena, strongly support the proposal. I support the proposal and think others should. I am reassured for several reasons:   This money will be well-allocated. The concern over \u201ctoo much\u201d or \u201ctoo little\u201d money seems to really be a concern that money will somehow be wasted, either through incompetence or (some suggest) nepotism or worse. I know many of the people on the committee and I know they are well-suited to manage this process. There won\u2019t be some mad dash to over-invest or misuse funds. They have expertise, are committed to the growth of this space as evidenced otherwise in their own careers, and are also bound by fiduciary obligations, which cannot be taken lightly (as these folks know). We live in a world of imperfect alternatives, but, if you are going to trust a group, I don\u2019t think there is another group of people I would trust more to make these allocations. (If there is simply no group someone would trust, then that is a different point regarding structure and tactics.)   We are not at the \u201cseed fund\u201d stage for politics. We are more like at the \u201cSeries F\u201d stage. For those who think that the size of the proposal alone suggests mismanagement, this is simply (a fraction) of what it costs to win. Politics is sometimes an adversarial game, much like sports or litigation. If you had to beat, say, the LA Lakers at home \u2026 you can\u2019t do it on a $2 million dollar budget. There is no point fielding a team of amateurs that will definitely lose, so you have to go big or go home. The top trade association bosses make over $2M each year (it is pretty sickening but there is often much more at stake, and democracy is better than the alternatives). Many of the most persuasive lawyers who lead teams that win these fights earn more than the average professional athlete. The proposed fund here is actually much too small to hire many of those people, but it could support the hiring of more good, hungry junior talent and a few targeted big hires\u2013as needed on specific topics for limited hours\u2013to field a solid team that can win consistently over time. This team could cost-effectively educate policy makers so that the community does not have too many last-minute, rushed, fire-drill, major threats. There will still be some unexpected major threats, and rebuffing those is where much of the budget will go. That cannot be easily predicted. The \u201cseed\u201d stage time for funding crypto policy was long ago; I was a consultant on a project for Coin Center back in 2015 and I remember having the luxury of time and seed stage budgets.   There will be a full-time hire. Someone has suggested we should name a full-time staff member because the committee members are busy. This is a great point. This overhead is necessary and there will be a full-time staff hire for the 501(c)(4) to focus exclusively on this organization and grant proposals. There would be a process to vet, select, interview, and hire the best person for the role. Interviewing the best people, likely in DC, willing to leave their current employers \u2026 is not something that could be done publicly. But doing so is probably the best way to identify and select talent.   We should agree to move quickly. The industry has had a bit of a grace period at least in the US. The administration change, appointment process, and hiring have given everyone about a 4 month break since the last major battle in January. This relative quiet was a happenstance \u2026 things are not going to stay quiet. Now the new administration is settled in. If this committee were funded today, it would also have to spend weeks hiring an initial staff member, reviewing proposals, analyzing strategy, etc. so that these funds are allocated the most effective way by Fall 2021. So the sooner that process could start, the more likely the industry can get ahead of some issues.   All committee members are strongly aligned with the interests of the Defi industry. Regardless of strategic preferences and tactics, we are all on the same team and striving for a fairer, more accessible, safer future of finance. While the committee does not claim to represent the industry as a whole, the committee does include three head lawyers from some of the world\u2019s leading Defi projects who think about and work to advance these issues every day with considerable real responsibility.   So to summarize:  If you had worried that 1M UNI is too much to allocate effectively in the policy education process \u2026 that\u2019s unfortunately just not the case. If this were a sports match, our side would not even be fielding enough players. To support a winning team on this field, this budget is a great start. If you had worried that the committee needs to prove they know how to allocate money with a small amount before being trusted with a multi-year grant and mission \u2026 you have better evidence than that. This group has demonstrated the necessary experience and expertise over many years. Plus, you simply can\u2019t recruit busy people of this high caliber to join a committee with an ineffective, tiny amount of money. They would spend their time doing something else more effective than that committee. If you simply oppose having a specific group of people allocate funds, and think that there is a better way to allocate these funds to the policy process, you may be right but I doubt it. I\u2019ve been part of many dozens of different policy efforts, all with different organizational structures. Here, a dedicated group with expertise could move most competently, most cost-effectively, and just as transparently on cost without harming the process by leaking too much of the strategy. This is a plan that would work well. Maybe another plan would work marginally more effectively, but I have not seen people put forward or coalesce around a concrete plan for a novel political grant-making structure that solves every problem without creating others\u2013nor a structure that has any precedent for success. No plan is perfect, and you can try to poke holes in any of them, but this plan has a good chance of working. To the extent ideas emerge for new forms of political organizing, activism, or coordination, this committee should fund at least some experimental policy tactics for anyone from the community who wants to apply.  All that said, I agree with many of the suggestions.  \u201cDefi Defense Fund\u201d does sound too defensive. I have been talking with the other committee members and we like the many suggestions to focus on education. We think that something like Defi Education Fund is much better. Open to better branding too. We agree that frequent community updates on progress, grant allocation, tactics, etc. are essential. These updates would not only ensure trust, but will also keep the community informed on when and how they can lend their voice to the process. Ensuring that policy-makers are well informed goes beyond an \u201cinside\u201d game and requires the participation of many more people. It is important not to waste people\u2019s time so that they get involved in ways that have the maximum impact, at the right time, reaching out to the right policy makers. We will provide updates and, where feasible, require grantees to do the same directly. The committee should put out a detailed budget within 90 days of the proposal passing. Of course, budgets, projections, and 5-year plans often must be revised and amended. As Mike Tyson famously said, \u201cEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\u201d When there are surprise punches, as there so often have been in the policy space, we should let you know why and how funds will be reallocated to address them. I agree that this Fund should protect the Uniswap protocol and educate policy-makers on its benefits. It can not be a slush fund at all, let alone for any other causes. But the Uniswap protocol stands on the shoulders of giants in a complicated web of composable code. Threats or misunderstandings about unhosted wallets, cryptocurrency, Ethereum, and decentralized finance protocols will impact the potential for the Uniswap protocol, so they must be considered. As a matter of strategy, much of the funding may go to supporting and educating policy makers about these lego pieces to protect the Uniswap protocol. As noted above, I totally agree on a full-time hire.  I hope people find my views as useful as I have others\u2019 and I look forward to continued discussion. ",

                    "content": "We appreciate the hard work of @hlsbfi in bringing this proposal forward. We think it\u2019s a good start, and wanted to offer some feedback that we think might enhance the idea further. 1. Crypto Native Approach. We agree with the policy objectives of the proposal. However we would encourage the community to consider other, more novel ways of achieving them. Rather than recreating the existing policy infrastructure (or indirectly funding it using the UNI treasury), we think this initiative has the potential to create something unique. In particular, something that is lacking from the current landscape and is uniquely enabled by the underlying technology. In other words, a more crypto native approach. What would that look like? For starters, it would formally be instantiated as an onchain DAO, which at a minimum would provide better transparency, tooling, and interoperability with the rest of the DeFi ecosystem. But more important than its technical form, the project would also take on the more collaborative and community-focused ethos that characterizes DAOs and DeFi governance today. It would seek participation from community representatives of every major DeFi protocol. And it would build consensus from these representatives on key matters. We think this type of architecture would lend greater legitimacy to the organization\u2019s decision making and allow it to more credibly speak on behalf of the broader DeFi community. This \u201cPolicy DAO\u201d could still elect leadership and engage in all of the same functions described in the proposal (just in a more transparent way). But it could also do things that existing industry groups (who lack this sort of community-level buy-in) frankly cannot do. For example, you could imagine it doing something like creating and publishing a set of best practices for new projects to follow. This could include things like security practices, code audits, financial reporting, disclosures, user safeguards, and so on. Many of these things are already done by the leading decentralized communities today (see the quarterly reports published by the Yearn and Maker communities as a great example). This would just be a way to formalize those practices a bit further and publish them for everyone to benefit from. But critically, rather than being dictated by a small few, these practices would be sourced from the participant developer communities, deliberated up through the governance process, and published on an open-source forum like Github for everyone to read. An initiative like this would go a long way towards demonstrating to policymakers a good-faith effort at industry self-governance. It could also meaningfully level-up the development and governance practices of new projects and communities entering the space. Point being, this is merely an example of something enabled by this type of cryptonative model - there are undoubtedly others. We think the proposal should lean into these aspects, rather than shy away from them. Doing so will allow it to add something both valuable and new to the policy landscape.We\u2019re happy to help the community brainstorm ideas and build an architecture that embodies these principles. 2. Take an Inclusive Approach. Building on the prior point, the strongest form of this initiative would be one that has buy-in from all of the protocol communities that it purports to represent. This doesn\u2019t mean the full list needs to be defined up front, but there could be ways to condition/stagger the disbursal of funds on obtaining some minimum degree of buy-in across the industry. We suspect there would be broad interest from other communities throughout DeFi. Assuming that\u2019s right, this should be brought forward as a coordinated effort across a number of communities to start, and not a unilateral one. We\u2019re happy to help drive those efforts. 3. Brighten the Message. Finally, the initiative should take on a much more positive message! The current proposal feels negative and defensive. For example, referring to it as the \u201cDeFi Defense Fund\u201d or a \u201cpolitical defense organization\u201d is likely to engender hostility with policymakers and undermine those engagement efforts. We would also recommend striking all the references to \u201cpolitical lobbying\u201d and things of that nature. The focus from the get go should be on the positive aspects of DeFi and the ways it\u2019s an improvement over the legacy financial system. This is ultimately a messaging point, but it will go a long way towards determining how the group is perceived. We can also help brainstorm ideas here as well. We look forward to working with the community on these points. Jeff Amico a16z For further important information, please see [https://a16z.com/disclosures/].  ",

                    "content": "Hi all, I\u2019m loving the thoughtful discussion on this topic. Overall, it seems like there\u2019s fairly strong consensus that Uniswap should fund outreach and advocacy. Protocol participants face an uncertain and potentially hostile legal environment, and educating policymakers could help avoid damaging conflicts down the road. But it seems there\u2019s less consensus over the amount of funds requested, and the oversight structure. The 1 million UNI requested would represent the largest DAO expense to date, and after approval Uniswap governance would have no direct control over the use of funds. Uniswap governance could approve incremental funding in smaller amounts, but there\u2019s some concern that a minimally scoped initiative would be less effective or risk running out of money before fulfilling its mandate. One potential solution is to add an oversight mechanism to the distributed UNI, allowing governance or an appointed admin to revoke funding if necessary. At Tally, we\u2019ve been working on a project funded through Uniswap grants to enable this sort of direct on-chain oversight: Safeguard.  How it works:  image1914\u00d7902 120 KB   Funds are placed into a Safeguard timelock contract, controlled by an executive multisig. The multisig signers (eg potentially the committee members listed above) would submit a transaction to transfer a portion of funds out of the timelock - these funds could be sent to the organization\u2019s legal entity account at an exchange to be converted to fiat. At the same time, they will communicate details and justification for the transaction to the community. If the transaction is suspicious, goes against community sentiment, or has insufficient information, a guardian mechanism can cancel the transaction while it is queued in the timelock. The guardian can also revoke funding and authority from the multisig entirely if needed. Assuming it is not cancelled during the timelock period, the transaction is executed and funds are sent to the intended parties.  This mechanism is highly configurable, and can support a variety of approval flows to suit the needs of governance. I think Safeguard could offer the best of both worlds for committee funding:  Optimistic governance - additional funding tranches are approved/released by default unless an objection is raised Concrete oversight - governance can block transactions or retrieved remaining funds if the committee loses community support  I\u2019m happy to answer any questions, and look forward to further discussion on this important topic!     GitHub    withtally/safeguard Safeguard is a tool for on-chain Ethereum governances to delegate funds to multisigs while keeping some level of control - withtally/safeguard      ",

                    "content": "These are great ideas.  Taking a more inclusive and crypto native approach will almost surely help to advance the cause and improve the optics here and with any regulator the group engaged with. However, most of the concerns raised before have not been addressed.  Why is so much money needed?  As Matt Corva wrote (see below), each major bank disclosed about $3m per year on policy spend.  This is a lot of money! However, each major bank operates a far larger, far more complex business than Uniswap \u2013 and faces far more legal and policy issues.  They really aren\u2019t comparable businesses.  Yet they only spent $3m per year. Why do we think Uniswap needs to spend so much more to handle a much narrower range of issues? \" To put it in perspective, upon a quick search, it looks like each major bank discloses approximately ~3MM in policy spend per year, and that\u2019s what is reported. That\u2019s not to say that the number proposed is correct or incorrect, but just to put real life costs to what otherwise might seem like a big number. \" Likewise, as Marvin said, trade association heads are paid more than $2m per year.  One example is Robert Cook, the head of FINRA.  Another is the current head of SIFMA.  Is this the sort of organization we are trying to from? If so, we probably need a much clearer plan and a large upgrade in talent.  The folks who typically take these jobs are former head regulators (Cook was a repeat division head at the SEC) - not young crypto lawyers.  What accountability is there?  As currently written, the proposal simply exits 1m Uni with no strings attached.  This is wildly out of line with how budgets work at the bigger banks and how regulatory campaigns are usually undertaken. For example, when the large US investment banks lobbied to influence the regulations promulgated under Dodd Frank, they typically needed to get approval of quarterly budgets and KPIs.  Project managers and often outside consultants were employed to drive the process.  If the results didn\u2019t occur, budget would be cut or changed and people would be fired. Here, what do we have besides a grant of 1m Uni to a small board - without even a clear statement of what success looks like. How is this OK when it is 10x more money than a typical large bank spends a year on lobbying?  Put differently, how do you think Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley would evaluate this proposal?  How is this conflict of interest acceptable?  At the same time as I am sympathetic to any lawyer or policy wonk who is fighting for DeFi, this proposal pretty clearly creates significant conflicts of interest for each lawyer involved, as well as HLSBFI.  Why are we comfortable with this? To see this very clearly, suppose that Hayden and 3 of his friends proposed taking 1m Uni from the Treasury to start a DeFi VC fund.  They then continued to pitch the project to all of you, and piled on to support it on Twitter. Then they pushed the issue to a vote and used their influence to exit 1m Uni to a separate fund that they controlled. Afterwards, they continued to be involved in Uniswap AND to hand out checks from the new VC fund - with no accountability to Uniswap. Why is this OK?  Do the behaviors of the lawyers who would be on this board actually support their being on this board?  As you probably guessed, my answer is no because of the conflicts of interest.  But I actually think it is worse. None of the responses from the potential board members have addresses the basic issues of accountability, budget size or conflicts.  In fact, none provide any evidence why 1m Uni are needed for this effort or how 1m Uni will be spent.  Likewise, none lay out any details on organizational structure, oversight, or staffing (beyond that the group will hire one full time employee). Moreover, may of the responses just seem disingenuous or irrelevant.  For example: If you had to beat, say, the LA Lakers at home \u2026 you can\u2019t do it on a $2 million dollar budget. There is no point fielding a team of amateurs that will definitely lose, so you have to go big or go home. The top trade association bosses make over $2M each year (it is pretty sickening but there is often much more at stake, and democracy is better than the alternatives). Many of the most persuasive lawyers who lead teams that win these fights earn more than the average professional athlete. The proposed fund here is actually much too small to hire many of those people, but it could support the hiring of more good, hungry junior talent and a few targeted big hires\u2013 To put it very bluntly, how is this relevant? And who, then, are the Goldman Sach\u2019s and Morgan Stanley\u2019s of the world hiring for $3m per year?  And, who are these partners? Aren\u2019t they the right comps \u2026, and the Lakers payroll just a side show? ",

                    "content": "I\u2019m Jake Chervinsky, General Counsel of Compound Labs and one of the proposed committee members for this organization. I strongly support the proposal and I\u2019d like to explain why in as much detail as possible here, as well as address some of the community\u2019s concerns. I\u2019ll start with a summary of my main points and then expand on each; if you have any questions or want me to dig deeper on anything, please ask. Summary   The success of DeFi in general, and Uniswap in particular, depends on how effectively we engage with regulators and policymakers over the next 6 to 18 months. If we fail to act quickly and forcefully, the consequences could be severe.   The proposed committee is well-qualified to manage this program, both in terms of skill and experience with DeFi policy and government affairs, and in terms of commitment to the principles of decentralized governance.   Funding for engagement with regulators and policymakers should come from DeFi protocol treasuries at the discretion of decentralized governance. Uniswap can take lead, but other protocols should join as well.   The proposed funding amount is appropriate given the scope and urgency of the task, especially considering how much money TradFi spends on government affairs, and the fact that centralized crypto companies have no incentive to lobby for DeFi.   Programs like this should always operate at the pleasure of decentralized governance, and those involved should always be accountable to the community. This means we, the committee members, must (and will) prioritize transparency.   About Me I\u2019m a lawyer based in Washington, D.C. with a background in regulatory compliance and government enforcement defense. I started my career with a multinational firm handling anti-money laundering and anti-corruption matters for Fortune 500 clients. After a federal judicial clerkship, I joined a boutique firm specializing in cross-border dispute resolution and white collar criminal defense. I fell down the crypto rabbit hole in 2017 and represented a number of clients in crypto-related matters involving the SEC, CFTC, and DOJ before joining the industry full-time. I joined Compound as General Counsel in May 2019 after realizing how DeFi can reshape the global financial system for the better. Since then, I\u2019ve focused all my energy on the legal, regulatory, and policy issues surrounding DeFi. I serve as Chair of the Blockchain Association\u2019s DeFi Working Group and as a Strategic Advisor to Variant Fund. I\u2019m a member of the Uniswap community and I\u2019m personally, deeply committed to the success of DeFi as a whole. Achieving the mission of this program is exactly why I\u2019m here in the first place. DeFi Regulatory and Political Landscape In my view, regulatory risk is the single greatest threat to DeFi today. Before this year, DeFi received fairly little attention from the government due to its small size; the industry\u2019s perception was that DeFi was \u201cflying under the radar.\u201d But with success comes scrutiny. After the rise of yield farming, the DeFi bull market, and Uniswap\u2019s appearance in mainstream media, those quiet days are over. Regulators and policymakers worldwide are now watching closely. Although some of them understand the benefits that DeFi offers, many others are skeptical about a decentralized financial system that lacks the intermediaries they regulate. Initial reactions from some regulators have been discouraging. In the AML/CFT arena, policy changes are now being considered that could significantly harm DeFi. For example, the FATF\u2019s March 2021 draft guidance suggested that governance token holders could qualify as regulated VASPs, or that crypto exchanges could be prohibited from allowing withdrawals to non-custodial wallets. Policymakers are also concerned about the risks posed by stablecoins \u2014 a critical piece of the DeFi ecosystem \u2014 to monetary sovereignty and financial stability. As time goes on, we can expect to hear more questions and concerns about numerous other subjects as well, including the US federal securities, commodities, and tax laws, to name a few. It\u2019s crucial that we take the concerns of regulators and policymakers seriously. Like it or not, they have an unparalleled ability to hamstring the growth of DeFi, and if we fail to engage, the most likely outcome is a draconian \u201cregulate first, ask questions later\u201d approach which could set DeFi back by years, if not permanently. Luckily, we still have time. Most regulators and policymakers haven\u2019t made up their minds yet, and in the US, some high-ranking positions are still waiting to be filled. But we can\u2019t wait; now is our best chance to have a meaningful impact on DeFi policy before these decisions are made for us without our input. Time is of the essence. Proposed Committee and Program Strategy My fellow proposed committee members are among the smartest, most experienced, and most effective advocates for good DeFi policy in the world. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working personally with nearly all of them and I have no doubt that they\u2019re the right people to lead this effort. From the feedback I\u2019ve seen, the community seems to agree, so I\u2019ll leave this here. But what exactly will we do with the funds? Although the decision won\u2019t be up to me alone, and my fellow committee members may have other (better) ideas, here\u2019s generally how I think about our strategy and use of funds:   Education. The vast majority of regulators and policymakers don\u2019t yet understand the technical and practical details that distinguish DeFi from TradFi. Without that knowledge, their initial reaction may be to impose the same regulatory obligations on DeFi protocols as they do on centralized financial institutions. In other words, they may mistakenly assume that Uniswap is an \u201cexchange\u201d like any other, implicating all the same risks and requiring all the same regulatory safeguards as Coinbase, et al. That\u2019s wrong. To avoid such an outcome, we need to educate regulators and policymakers on how DeFi works and why its unique properties negate the need for many traditional regulations.   Advocacy. We can\u2019t just educate government officials about the greatness of DeFi and then hope they leave us alone. Instead, we need to advocate strongly in favor of policies that support adoption of DeFi protocols and against policies that restrict access to DeFi or create a regulatory moat around entrenched incumbents. Good advocacy is both reactive and proactive; we need to address regulatory developments as they arise and advance our own policy proposals. Good advocacy is also both government-facing and public-facing; we need to engage with regulators and policymakers while also building consensus within the industry and grassroots support from the community.   Defense. We need to be prepared to take swift action in case of hostile guidance, rulemaking, legislation, executive orders, enforcement actions, or otherwise. It\u2019s hard to predict in advance what form our defensive efforts might take, and hopefully the need won\u2019t materialize at all. Yet, there\u2019s plenty we can and should do now to prepare for the worst. For example, we could commission legal research on defense theories or constitutional protections that may apply to DeFi. Equally important, it\u2019s a huge benefit to have resources set aside and available to allocate quickly in an emergency.   I anticipate the bulk of this work will involve retaining specialists such as researchers, lawyers, lobbyists, organizers, designers, and consultants, as well as making contributions to other aligned organizations and hiring full-time staff for the 501(c)(4). I understand that hiring lawyers and lobbyists may seem distasteful \u2014 in a sense, it goes against the ethos of DeFi, which emphasizes opting out of the legacy power structures that brought us to this point in the first place \u2014 but as @Marvin put it, this is \u201cwhat it takes to win.\u201d I prefer to win. Funding from Uniswap and Other Protocols Given the importance of engaging on DeFi policy, I believe this program is a valuable use of Uniswap\u2019s resources and a paramount example of how DeFi communities can achieve off-chain goals without sacrificing the decentralization at their core. Uniswap is especially well-positioned to lead this initiative. The issues and strategy that I outlined above are particularly important for Uniswap as a decentralized exchange protocol that allows users to trade an enormous range of Ethereum-based assets, an activity that\u2019s heavily regulated in the traditional centralized context. Uniswap also has the capacity to fund the program thanks to its substantial treasury. That said, I appreciate the feedback from some community members that Uniswap shouldn\u2019t be asked to fund the entire program on its own, or all in one shot (more on that below). There\u2019s no question that, to be effective, we will need to engage with regulators and policymakers on behalf of the entire DeFi sector, not just Uniswap. For that reason, although I do believe Uniswap is the right \u201cfounding protocol\u201d for this program, my hope is that other DeFi communities will see fit to join the effort and allocate additional funds from their treasuries to the 501(c)(4). Initial and Total Funding Amounts As far as I can tell, the point of greatest contention within the community is how much funding the program should receive. In my opinion, the size of the request in this Consensus Check is ultimately appropriate given the magnitude of the task at hand. As @sukernik explained, we aren\u2019t proposing to form a startup that can wait to launch a minimum viable product before seeking additional funding. We\u2019re proposing to form a nonprofit that can meaningfully impact policy on the global stage within the next 6 months. This mission is an expensive one. There are thousands (literally, thousands) of regulators and policymakers worth engaging around the world today. There\u2019s virtually no amount of money that we couldn\u2019t put to good use immediately. Other industries that have above-average success with government affairs \u2014 including TradFi itself \u2014 spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year to influence policy in the United States alone. Make no mistake, we are the underdogs. In my view, if protocol treasuries can help us level the playing field, we\u2019re obligated to use them. It\u2019s particularly important for protocol treasuries to fund DeFi-specific policy efforts because nobody else will. As of now, centralized crypto companies have a tense relationship with DeFi. While they appreciate the role that DeFi tokens played in catalyzing the bull market, they also see DeFi protocols as competitors. These companies aren\u2019t incentivized to, and indeed do not, dedicate resources toward DeFi policy. Coin Center and the Blockchain Association are both fantastic organizations, but neither focuses exclusively on DeFi as the 501(c)(4) would. If this is to be the only DeFi-specific policy organization in the world, we should fund it properly. However, I also appreciate that 1M UNI is a significant sum, even if only a small fraction of the total treasury, and that some community members aren\u2019t convinced that the full amount should be allocated in a single vote. With that in mind, I wouldn\u2019t object to a smaller initial grant to get the program up and running, with the expectation that we will request additional funds from Uniswap and other protocols when appropriate. Although it may be difficult to measure our progress objectively over short time periods, I trust that the community can understand and evaluate our work in light of that caveat. Transparency and Accountability Transparency and accountability are essential to the success of this program and others like it. For many reasons, decentralized governance simply doesn\u2019t work if the governors don\u2019t have equal access to information about the protocol, including how its funds are being used. My goal as a proposed committee member is to provide as much public transparency as possible, to hold myself accountable to the community in the performance of my role, and to hold my fellow committee members to the same high standards. @Marvin has already outlined the steps we\u2019ll take regarding community updates, budgeting, and more. Personally, I\u2019ll endeavor to make myself available to answer questions and attend community calls as much as possible. Conclusion We\u2019re at a challenging time in DeFi\u2019s history. Since last summer, we\u2019ve proved the concept that financial activities more complex than transferring and storing value can be decentralized. As a reward, we\u2019re now a subject of attention for regulators and policymakers worldwide. I strongly support this proposal because I believe it will help us advance good DeFi policy, a goal that is essential to Uniswap\u2019s long-term success and well worth the cost. ",

                    "content": "Dear Colleague Everyone here has agreed that DeFi needs an organized effort to \u201ceducate\u201d lawmakers and governments (not just one Government) about DeFi, in a manner that will prevent overregulation and protect the DeFi ecosystems. Education might be a smarter way to put it, given that lobbying may not be a tax deductible activity (however, if lobbying is underneath education, then it may be considered what it is and not what it proclaims). From what can be understood, in response to the well-founded fear that if things are left to their own fate, there may be a crackdown or overregulation or bad regulation of DeFi, it has been proposed here that a US-based non profit is created, with a fixed committee as BD, in which, if this is voted, you will participate. It has been explained that since the US is an important country for the \u201cfate\u201d of DeFi, the efforts are going to be concentrated in the US. To that end, a 1M Uni fund will be \u201cset aside\u201d (sic) for \u201ceducative\u201d plans and, in fact, for lobbying and precautionary activities, including -but not necessarily- legal ones. The time-frame of spending the sum and achieving the goals (which remain to be further clarified) is 4-5 years. For other members, the first results would need 2 years to be seen. For you, it would take about 6 months for the first tangible results to become visible and able to be assessed. However, you also admit that \u201cit may be difficult to measure our progress objectively over short time periods\u201d. There is no breakdown of the proposed non-profit\u2019s activities meaningfully presented. The best effort so far is contained in your above post. Also. No \u201csample statute\u201d of such a non profit has been uploaded, so that it becomes more clear what kind of provisions you have in mind, in regard to governance, decision making, transparency and accountability. So, up to this point, those of us who follow with interest this discussion, have to guess. A lot of issues are in this manner evading the realm of actual scrutiny This lack of clarity on the part of the proposal, in regard to critical aspects of the project, still rigidly undermine the discussion. You say [quote=\u201cjchervinsky, post:71, topic:12700\u201d] Transparency and accountability are essential to the success of this program and others like it. \u2026 My goal as a proposed committee member is to provide as much public transparency as possible, to hold myself accountable to the community in the performance of my role, and to hold my fellow committee members to the same high standards. [/quote] However, -\u201chow much transparency is possible\u201d? (or, let me put it differently: how much transparency is \u201cnot possible\u201d?). You saying \u201cas much transparency as possible\u201d implies that at least \u201csome\u201d transparency is not possible. -nothing clear has been said about \u201ctransparency and accountability\u201d -how, specifically, do you intend to guarantee it? -what are the \u201csame high standards\u201d that you and the other (proposed) committee members will be bound by? Another issue is that you also do not address the concern of many that the amounts requested are outrageously high. Statements such as \u201cthis mission is an expensive one\u201d and that \u201cother industries spend hundreds of millions each year to influence policy\u201d are not sufficient. The fact that the proposal explicitly stated that it indents to influence US policy (which many did not agree with, given the nature of DeFi) contradicts the statement that \u201cthere are thousands of regulators and policymakers worth engaging around the world today\u201d. While I would of course agree with the latter, as I have stated in other comments above, the discrepancy between the launching goals and the extension of the scope of the proposed Committee\u2019s work and funding (from US to global, that is, almost 200 times wider) might create an ambiance of distrust. It is, again, crucial that you define the project better. Because, if 1M is seen as a lot for influencing regulation in the US, it may seem for working, in parallel, in 200 jurisdictions. Noone would object if 5.000 UNI were used to influence lawmakers in a country. But 1M just for the US has aroused the objection reflexes in many. Many other concerns have not been addressed. Such as why the proposed committee cannot have a strong consultative role. Why it has to play the intermediary in the allocation of funds, alienating them from Uniswap\u2019s treasury even before the action to be taken becomes concrete. Also, whether the BD will be porous or \u201cclosed\u201d. Transparency and Accountability issues. How to keep a decentralized character in it. The \u201crepresentative of DeFi\u201d role is also very concerning. It is also not easy to see why putting aside 1M uni to a non profit is \u201cwhat it takes to win\u201d. Is it because someone said so? Also, tax concerns have not been answered. If giving these funds to a non profit may endanger seeing up to 35% of these sums end up in the Government\u2019s treasury in the form of taxes, which could be averted if Uniswap paid who the Committee suggested it should pay, then why on earth would a non profit need to play the role of distributor of funds? Have you ensured that a huge sum of UNI will not end up being used in taxes, via the materialization of this proposal? It should most probably be considered a given that everyone here wants to see DeFi protected and thrive. As I see it, instead of struggling to achieve regulation -while there is no consensus that there must be any at this infant stage of DeFi- that will be time-sensitive and can be subjected to change (therefore needing a constant outflow of funds -theoretically to infinity- to \u201cstay DeFi friendly\u201d), the true protection of this field is ultimately a question of preparing to set the red lines about how far governments -all governments- can go in regulating our economic freedom and our rights, including and primarily our participatory rights. I believe some experts in fields related to the latter should be part of the proposed Committee. ",

In particular, I\u2019m glad you enumerated some of the specific legal threats you expect to see in the next 6-12 months and injected some of your knowledge about the legal landscape here. In terms of planning and budgeting, I think it would be helpful to enumerate even more of the specific legal issues this group expects DeFi to encounter over the next year. In tandem, it would be helpful to outline an expected budget to be spent fighting for each specific issue. If we plan to encounter, for example, a ban on sending tokens from exchanges to non-custodial wallets, then what does this group think is required to fight against it? What would it cost to hire lawyers, consultants, etc. to sufficiently defend against this issue? For other expected issues? This kind of outline, though it obviously won\u2019t be perfect, would make me feel much more confident in this proposal. Aside from that, my biggest remaining concerns are the all-at-once allocation of capital and the lack of a full-time hire responsible for administrative overhead. If this group committed to a full-time hire and started with an initial allocation of capital to cover the first 6-12 months of operation, I\u2019d probably be in support. Without all of those changes, I\u2019m still firmly against, though I think all of your reasoning behind this group\u2019s motivations is spot-on. ",

So, board members would be exposing themselves to a real risk of liability if they misuse the funds.

Marc Boiron is head of Blockchain Association DeFi group. If Blockchain Association has not allowed transparency and collaboration with the public through now, why would they start allowing it? How will those of you with ties to multiple organizations square your duties to be \u2018zealous advocates\u2019 for those specific organizations with a duty to work in the interests of DeFi in general? Will you recuse yourself every time the interests or rules and policies of your specific organizations conflict with those of DeFi in general? What if a regulator or legislator would make a compromise for projects that are not backed by VCs but maintains that VC-backed projects too closely mirror the traditional IPO path and must be regulated more stringently? Will you accept the compromise for the good of DeFi even though you represent multiple VC-backed projects and are \u2018special advisor\u2019 to a VC? What about if a regulator points out the power and influence of Uniswap Corporation over the DAO and suggests that regulation could be lighter if the DAO had lower quorum requirements or if the Uniswap Corporation were dissolved? How will you decide whether it is \u2018possible\u2019 to disclose this information to the DAO? What about the GC of Uniswap Corporation\u2013he will have a huge conflict of interest in this scenario, won\u2019t he? Since nearly all information you receive from and send to regulators and legislators will impact your legal clients, how is it possible that such information will not be subject to atty-client confidentiality duties and that you can share it publicly? How will you separate your advocacy efforts as part of this nonprofit purporting to represent all of DeFi from your advocacy efforts for your specific clients? Is your assumption that DeFi projects are so incentive-aligned that advocating \u2018for DeFi\u2019 is the same as advocating \u2018for Compound\u2019, even though there may be many distinctions between various DeFi projects and Compound on any number of issues? If you agree that there can be conflicts, how will that be navigated considering that you, Rebecca and Marc are all extrinsically affiliated through current and past organizations/relationships? Won\u2019t you inevitably be biased toward defending structures and situations that you have previously supported and thus reducing your own potential for liability, rather than admitting to the potential legal flaws with those and working toward new creative compromises with regulators? What does transparency mean to you? Many have asked empirical questions about the origins and motives for this proposal that have not been answered. Is that something it\u2019s \u2018impossible\u2019 for the proposers to be transparent about? Would you submit draft legislation to the DAO for review/comment before it is submitted to a congressional committee? What about draft no-action letters? If you were coordinating with specific projects or leaders in DeFi regarding a specific issue, would you disclose that? Will the CEOs of Compound, Uniswap and Aaave have more access to the information and decisionmaking of this non-profit than the core devs of Sushiswap and Yearn? To what extent is this proposal being supported by VCs and team members who may face personal liability regarding their choices? and don\u2019t they have a conflict of interest re: their support, since otherwise they would have to spend (more of) their personal funds on defense? These are critical kinds of questions that you guys are sweeping under the rug. ",

                    "content": "Marvin Ammori, again, the CLO of Uniswap Labs. Providing a few more comments. You can read more about my background and thoughts above. First, I am a big fan of innovative structures beyond traditional corporations. I am particularly in favor of choosing the right structure for the right task. Injecting a novel funding structure in the cryptocurrency political environment, unfortunately, is probably the last place to do it. When policymakers see novel structures, they will not assume transparency but the lack thereof! They understand 501(c)4 organizations and deal with them often and know their transparency safeguards, which nobody would have to reinvent or explain. New structures will likely confuse partners and policymakers and at the least add considerable overhead to most interactions in a pretty traditional town. If the choice is to be effective and trusted in policy circles or to be slightly more crypto-native, for this amount of money and with this much at stake I would choose more effective and we know a 501(c)4 can be effective. Second, I expect some other proposals to distribute funds in tranches. That is not right for this proposal. We are balancing several considerations, which include participation, trust, transparency and, most importantly, effectiveness in spending funds to advance these important goals (a constant topic in this discussion). To tranche out the funds will dramatically weaken the organization\u2019s effectiveness. First, the crypto advocacy organizations would not be able to effectively compete in the job market against organizations that have obviously stable long-term funding versus short term trial grants. I have been involved in trying to hire people to organizations with uncertain funding, and it scares away a lot of the best people who have offers at other organizations with more stable funding. (This is another reason why the committee should not try to hire a full-time person now, as the hiring process is usually very intensive and fewer people will interview for a proposed role rather than a secure role.) Second, organizations in the space applying for funding won\u2019t be able to appropriately make long-term plans without secure funding. Third, policymakers need to understand that their counterparties are credible repeat players. They know well-funded multi-year organizations are not fly-by-night operations. They will be extremely skeptical of and confused by a smaller fund that may be replenished based on ongoing votes. There is no need to hamstring or cripple these efforts. Finally, the proposal to tranche seems inspired by the view that 1M is too much for the purposes here. As many of us have explained, that is simply not the case. Trust and transparency can be addressed in the ways discussed by the committee in many comments above (frequent spending reports, budget, progress reports, community calls etc.). Tranching is another way to address them, but would undermine the fund\u2019s effectiveness. Finally, it is worth noting that 77% of votes in the Consensus Check have been cast in favor of the proposal. Even the small holders are overwhelmingly in favor, assuming nobody tried to game the system by voting multiple times (which would have no effect on the vote\u2019s outcome). While there is some dissent, this process is designed to reach an outcome with a majority of holders and delegates\u2013and not complete paralysis without unanimity. While the community comments, support, and suggestions have been very useful and the proposers and committee intend to incorporate the feedback \u2014 particularly around accountability and transparency \u2014 into the final on-chain proposal, I am delighted to see that there is such majority consensus in this vote among holders and delegates.

One of your main points (which is very strong IMHO) is that tranching would undermine the funds Effectiveness. So what we we do optimistic governance? In this case, Tally has built, for Uniswap via the Grants program, a tool call \u201cFail Safe\u201d outlined by @monet-supply above. This tool could be deployed such that the legal team would be able to make funding requests directly from a Timelock, which if unopposed, would be automatically released. The design of the Fail Safe is such that we could make the Uniswap Governance itself the entity which would have the power to oppose a payment. This would be effective because:   The Legal group has certainty on their funding. The funds are earmarked and only can be spent by the legal group. The group knows that if their funding request is not opposed, they will receive their payments of fund.   To oppose a disbursement of funds, it would require a full Uniswap token holder vote. That means the social capital required to oppose a funding request would be equal to that of a full Governance vote. That should give you assurance that the funds are available because I think everyone here is aware of the enormous social capital needed to organize an effective vote that passes.   The Failsafe project is built by Tally, it is OpenSource and paid for by Uniswap. It gives token holders the tool of last resort to intervene should their worst fears come true and the threshold to success is high enough that it would require the very supporters of this proposal to lose faith in the legal teams effectiveness. There is no need to return to governance quarterly to beg for new funds, the legal team can request funds at their leisure + necessity. Why not consider a compromise like that? It seems like a 2.5m Uni Proposal threshold and 40m quorum would be quite enough to give the legal team certainty they have access to all the funds they need, while also giving token holders confidence that this really is a DAO.

At the same time, this concept of micro-funding and milestones etc. isn\u2019t tenable for a venture like this, particularly if you want to pull in the heavy hitters who are going to dedicate their time to make this possible. There needs to be a budget that\u2019s approved, functional objectives (that can be modified), and perhaps a transparency framework beyond what\u2019s already inherent in non-profits. I\u2019m a pragmatic person, so I don\u2019t think I share any of the concerns about this being a front to pay Uniswap or their investors legal fees (I\u2019m sure they can pay their own, if they have any), so I\u2019m inherently more trusting of the budget because I understand the cost of a project like this and I have confidence in those participating and the non-profit structure.

My notes: $1m budget for first year: Just normal startup lawyers that service ordinary startups cost $1000 per hour. A $1 million dollar budget would give the committee a little under five months of runway for just one person. Once you add in the cost of taxes, accounting, filings, just normal day-to-day business costs for a legal firm, and you\u2019re basically done before September. Edit: (I don\u2019t know the right amount that should be spent per year, but I think $1m doesn\u2019t sound like enough) Committee members subject to tokenholder approval I think the Committee should be judged as a group, if this committee thinks it needs these individuals to make the project work, we either support this group of individuals, or don\u2019t do it. Doesn\u2019t make sense to say, \u201cYeah let\u2019s do it, but oh- you can\u2019t use the people you think you need to get it done.\u201d They need to have the ability to organize themselves in such a way that they believe they are setup for success. Core team & early access investors abstain from vote I understand why this might be a nice provision to add, but I don\u2019t get why the folks who might have the best perspective should be prevented from contributing their voting power. Perhaps their voice has an outsized influence, but so have been their contributions, no? I\u2019m also not crazy about creating classes of votes here, if they have access to their tokens, and it was always understood that they could vote, then they should be able to vote. Feels like weird engineering to construct the eligible voters based on the subject of the vote. It\u2019s either token holder governance or it\u2019s not. (But I\u2019m sure this could be a WHOLE different discussion). No WEF involvement Again, why hobble the committee right out of the gate? I\u2019m not an expert on the WEF, but if the experts we empower think it\u2019s necessary to work with them, in order to achieve their stated goals, I think we have to empower them and trust their judgement. As per this comment:  What urgency? Do you know something that we don\u2019t? Is there impending regulation? Have there been talks with regulators? I have not seen anything to indicate that urgency exists to jump into such a huge commitment. If you know something, you (or core team) need to share it.  If there is urgency, maybe they can\u2019t share it. That doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable. Also reading between the lines, the fact that this proposal is being described in terms as urgent, seems to be a pretty good indicator that, yes, there might be something urgent that can\u2019t be spelled out here in a public forum. Maybe it\u2019s just someone had dinner with someone, a few too many drinks and something slipped out. That happens all the time. Doesn\u2019t mean this is the case here, but it wouldn\u2019t be an unreasonable conclusion.  Certainly something has propelled someone to ask for $30 million and think that was a reasonable response. Finally: I think this proposal should be considered from the pro/con point of view. Whats the risk versus reward calculation here? Clearly the risk is that they abscond with the $30 million and spend it on steak dinners and long weekends in DC hotel suites. Sure. That could happen. But the worst case scenario doesn\u2019t seem like it has the potential to do any substantial harm to token holders or the Uniswap project at large. Sure we will be pissed they ran off with the money, but them being turning out to be rich scammers hardly makes my life worse if it were to happen. They could liquidate the tokens, drop the price by what, a couple dollars temporarily? Sucks in theory, but doesn\u2019t harm us. So then let\u2019s consider how likely that is to happen. These folks are all well known individuals with careers that in their lifetimes could still net many multiples of $$$ more than this proposals value is worth- even though it\u2019s worth quite a lot. In the grand Risk/Reward here- doesn\u2019t seem likely for them to steal the money. So the point is: It neither seems realistic they would outright be corrupt, nor that in the worse case scenario would any true harm come to token holders or the protocol. So then lets consider the other side of the coin: Let\u2019s say we give them this enormous amount of money, and they work hard and fail. Thats the same outcome as doing nothing, so again, no real loss. But let us say we give them this enormous amount of money, and they are right. We empower them with the trust and tools to do the job correctly, (See my and @monet-supply\u2019s posts above for solid accountability tools) and low and behold: It works. They educate policy makers, help create a positive legal environment for DeFi, and now we\u2019re on a path towards global success. The upside here, the reward, is just so massive, that it dwarfs the potential downside. I personally would like to see them use the accountability tools that we have been building for them (All open source) which would empower them with the funds and certainty they need to build a kick-ass team, while leaving Token Holders with the ultimate authority. Otherwise, I\u2019ve come around, and I support this proposal and I think we should find a way to set this team up for success: both in our eyes and their own. ",

Significant incidents involving technical failures and attacks on DeFi services have already occurred. Moreover, questions remain about the actual extent of decentralization of some protocols \u2013 and associated risks, e.g. for manipulation \u2013 and whether DeFi is more than a risky new vehicle for speculation that may open the door to fraud and illicit activity.\u201d According to the proposal we are discussing here, the 7th member of the non profit\u2019s Committee is \" 1.

That WEF -UniPenn \u2018companion report\u2019 was also reviewed by, among others, proposed BD member Sheila Warren (World Economic Forum). Maybe the proposed members of the Committee, who contributed to these DeFi global regulation inspirations, might wish to share their views about the relevance of the WEF\u2019s papers with the present proposal. In my view, as long as it is even conceivable that millions would just flow out of Uniswap, \u201cto start with\u201d, also inspiring thoughts about getting extra sums from other DAOs, we\u2019re going to see a much more \u201crelevant\u201d journalistic coverage, especially as the time approaches for voting the proposal. The latter, as I understand, is already considered as voted for. Which would make a great case study. This bulk of information might also answer some concerns about what could be expected to go wrong. Urging Governments and regulators to take measures (or participating in such efforts) and then proposing oneself as the 40M solution to \u201cdefend\u201d the space from regulation is, to put it lightly, of concern.

I also agree that it\u2019s unlikely this is a front to pay legal fees (there are plenty of other ways for everyone involved to cover them) and speculating about that sort of intent isn\u2019t very helpful because it\u2019s just not knowable. What I find so troubling, however, is the governance structure and dynamic. Regardless of intent, the proposal creates (i) a separate organization, (ii) with a separate board, (iii) no ownership by Uniswap\u2019s token holders or equity holders and (iv) that works to lobby on behalf of \u201call defi.\u201d This is definitionally misalinged with Uniswap\u2019s equity holders, token holders and management has no accountability to any of them once it is funded.  In fact, the grant size is probably large enough to serve as an endowment if deposited into Yearn or a similar yield product. So why would you do this? Why wouldn\u2019t you create a new entity that is accountable to Uniswap\u2019s equity owners, governance token holders and management and fund it like a subsidiary or an oganization that operates on behalf of Uniswap? For heavy hitters, what are you envisioning, and who do you think would decline to participate if there were funding / accountability milestones (like a corporate general counsel would have for running a litigation or a regulatory reform effort)? Again, a lot of what strikes me as odd is the total lack of accountability and linkage of budget to needs. For example, if Marvin were to run this project as a new business unit, wouldn\u2019t we expect that he would ask for dedicated headcount, a budget for those headcount, and then submit quarterly requests for budget based on the needs? For example, I could imagine seeking the following: Annual Budget A. Headcount  1x New head of regulatory affairs - $300k/year 1x New director of regulatory affairs - $200k/year 1x Admin assistant  - $100k/year $600k/year B. G&A - $100k/year Total Yearly Overhead - $700k/year Quarterly Budget Goal 1 - $200k Goal 2 - $100k Goal 3 - $100k In this way, there would be routine accountability to Uniswap, you\u2019d still have an annual budget that\u2019s 75% of Coin Center\u2019s and you\u2019d be able to size and target the budget to realistically and transparently support Uniswap\u2019s needs.

A $1 million dollar budget would give the committee a little under five months of runway for just one person. Once you add in the cost of taxes, accounting, filings, just normal day-to-day business costs for a legal firm, and you\u2019re basically done before September. Edit: (I don\u2019t know the right amount that should be spent per year, but I think $1m doesn\u2019t sound like enough)   CoinCenter\u2019s budget has been $1m/year for quite some time. Why does this fund need a budget that is 5-6x that of CoinCenter?     dennisonb:  Committee members subject to tokenholder approval I think the Committee should be judged as a group, if this committee thinks it needs these individuals to make the project work, we either support this group of individuals, or don\u2019t do it. Doesn\u2019t make sense to say, \u201cYeah let\u2019s do it, but oh- you can\u2019t use the people you think you need to get it done.\u201d They need to have the ability to organize themselves in such a way that they believe they are setup for success.   Fine, then the WEF involvement should disqualify this entire panel. There is zero reason that this committee should involve any politiclly controversial figures.     dennisonb:  Core team & early access investors abstain from vote I understand why this might be a nice provision to add, but I don\u2019t get why the folks who might have the best perspective should be prevented from contributing their voting power. Perhaps their voice has an outsized influence, but so have been their contributions, no? I\u2019m also not crazy about creating classes of votes here, if they have access to their tokens, and it was always understood that they could vote, then they should be able to vote. Feels like weird engineering to construct the eligible voters based on the subject of the vote. It\u2019s either token holder governance or it\u2019s not. (But I\u2019m sure this could be a WHOLE different discussion).   Core team & early investors can conceive a proposal, propose it, then vote it into existence without any community involvement. This completely negates the idea of decentralization. If they want to continue to participate the way that they are, then they should just admit that this is not a decentralized governance process.     dennisonb:  No WEF involvement Again, why hobble the committee right out of the gate? I\u2019m not an expert on the WEF, but if the experts we empower think it\u2019s necessary to work with them, in order to achieve their stated goals, I think we have to empower them and trust their judgement.   \u201cExperts\u201d? There are no experts here. WEF has a stated goal to execute a \u201cGreat Reset\u201d of society and is highly political. There is zero chance that WEF will be acting in the best interests of tokenholders. Their stated goal is to act in the best interests of \u201cthe world\u201d. That is not at all conducive to this capitalist experiment. ",

                    "content": "Here at Gauntlet, we try to focus our participation in governance on outcomes we know well - market risk management and parameter optimization. We often abstain from votes like this, but after careful internal discussion we are supporting this proposal** There has been great feedback, much of which we hope is addressed, but that can happen before or after the proposal passes. However, the value of creating greater regulatory certainty in the space is very high, and we need to bias towards action here. Our team met with the CFTC in 2019 and regulators have had every intention of creating a regulatory environment in which crypto can operate for quite some time. However,  the regulatory \u201cprogress\u201d over the past years has been limited to a few misguided efforts like The STABLE Act. It is clear from our discussions with knowledgeable parties that creating regulatory certainty will be a herculean task. While the sum requested is large, the sum needed is even larger. DeFi should expect this to be the first of many such requests, not just to the UNI community, but to other large DAOs in the space as well. Many of the options discussed, like a small budget to fund an exploratory committee, do not provide a clear path to creating meaningful progress. This is a hard problem, and we shouldn\u2019t kid ourselves when considering other options. If you look at Uniswap governance, there have been two proposals passed since it was deployed last year. The Uniswap DAO is a $7B organization that has, for all intents and purposes, done two \u201cthings\u201d in 9 months. You could chalk this up to token holders being fiscally conservative, but calling this conservative is a euphemism that obscures a somber truth - the DAO is in a state of almost total stasis. Protocols like Compound have been more successful, with 30 or so proposals passed in that same time period. But don\u2019t be mistaken - even 30 \u201cthings\u201d is almost nothing for an organization of this size, which could have a tremendous impact not just for UNI token holders but on the world itself. DAOs need to take more risk, but this risk should be justified by a real chance of an outsize reward. The regulatory risk in crypto is one of the largest impediments to adoption and this Political Defense Organization is a group of people with decades of experience advocating in Washington effectively for improved technology policy. There are no guarantees, but the chance of success here is very credible. Gauntlet hopes this is the first of many more proposals that think big and take a swing at hard problems like regulatory risk. If we had one piece of feedback, it would be that compensation for PDO employees be denominated in UNI (or other DeFi protocol tokens), so that there is better incentive alignment. After all, the PDO should provide value to UNI holders and this would cement that commitment. However, this is not blocking feedback - we trust the committee members to balance this with other tradeoffs that arise.  This trust might be misplaced, but we have much reason to think it\u2019s not and we are willing to take the risk that we are wrong here. In the end, if you don\u2019t risk being wrong, you don\u2019t ever have a chance to be right. This could be a step forward, not just for UNI, not just for DeFi, but for decentralized organizations to enter a new era of faster and greater progress. ** Of course, when the final proposal is published, we\u2019d have to re-evaluate in the face of any material changes.

                    "content": "Thanks to everyone for the discussion. To address a few questions since my last post: Re: the urgency of moving forward, there really isn\u2019t anything confidential you need to know to understand the difficult policy environment we\u2019re in now. It was all over this week\u2019s news. Take the speech from CFTC Commissioner Berkovitz on Tuesday, for example. He said:  Not only do I think that unlicensed DeFi markets for derivative instruments are a bad idea, I also do not see how they are legal under the CEA\u2026Apart from the legality issue, in my view it is untenable to allow an unregulated, unlicensed derivatives market to compete, side-by-side, with a fully regulated and licensed derivatives market\u2026For all these reasons, we should not permit DeFi to become an unregulated shadow financial market in direct competition with regulated markets.  Thankfully Commissioner Berkovitz doesn\u2019t speak for the entire CFTC, but it doesn\u2019t take much for a speech like this to turn into new anti-DeFi guidance or rulemaking. We need to make our case to the CFTC now, not twelve months from now. The same is true for Congress, as you can tell if you listened to Senator Warren and her colleagues during yesterday\u2019s Senate Banking Committee hearing. Re: conflicts of interest, I think DeFi projects in general are incentive-aligned to the point that there\u2019s no conflict in advocating for them as a category. The difficult question is how to define the category, which determines the projects that fall within our scope. This is something I\u2019d want community feedback on, but not something I view as a conflict. For me personally, having worked on DeFi policy for a couple years now, I don\u2019t anticipate any conflicts between my day job and my work here. If a conflict did arise, I\u2019d handle it according to my fiduciary duties, abstaining or recusing myself if necessary. Re: transparency, we\u2019ve said a lot here about the steps we\u2019ll take to keep the community informed and engaged. Because of the nature of the work, there may be some details that aren\u2019t appropriate to publish online (advice of counsel, litigation strategy, etc.), which is why I said \u201cas much public transparency as possible\u201d in my last post. Regardless, I\u2019m confident that we can and will share more than enough information for the community to assess our progress. Re: WEF, I can\u2019t tell anyone what to think about the organization, but I will say I hold Sheila in high regard and think she would bring a unique and valuable perspective to the program. She led the WEF\u2019s DeFi Policymaker Toolkit project which resulted in solid work product, and from what I know, her views on DeFi are well-aligned with the community. Re: funding, I agree with the comments from @dennisonb and @jmo on the size of the request. As I said before, I think the total amount is justified given the magnitude of the challenge. Still, I don\u2019t think Uniswap has to fund it all at once, or alone. I support a smaller initial funding amount than proposed, with the expectation that we\u2019ll make future requests from Uniswap and other protocols. Re: accountability, I support governance having an oversight mechanism to keep the 501(c)(4) accountable, as long as it doesn\u2019t discourage other protocols from contributing as well (such as if Uniswap has special oversight privileges). I don\u2019t have any particular preference as to how oversight is achieved; perhaps a limited initial funding amount with the ability to deny future requests is sufficient. ",

Thing is, why would we seek to solve the slowness problem by giving $25m of of cash, with no strings attached to the lawyers Uniswap has used in the past and who got us here? Isn\u2019t the slowness to act a result of their failure or inability to execute? Isn\u2019t the fact that they seem to be blindsided by the recent CFTC comments a result of their lack of familiarity with futures and derivatives law?  Aren\u2019t any OFAC issues they face the result of their lack of familiarity with the areas at issue? Moreover, what have Uniswap\u2019s lawyers been doing for Uniswap for the past few months - other than pitching us to give them 1m Uni \u2026 and working for other projects? To test how much this should cost,  I reached out to the market a bit. I learned that you can hire Consensys\u2019s primary outside counsel for securities law lobbying and Bitfinex\u2019s primary outside counsel for under $500k/year. @jamico @DCinvestor Why don\u2019t we just hire these firms, who are actually experts and have a proven track record of successfully producing results, for a mere 100k Uni\u2026and actually solve the problems that Uniswap faces? How is this not a better option than giving 1m Uni to the very people who have gotten us here - and are on the payroll of other projects, will have no accountability to the Uniswap token holders, investors and management and are pretty clearly behaving opportunistically here? Let\u2019s take off the kid gloves, folks. We can get the same sorts of results as CeFi exchanges by hiring people who will actually for Uniswap for 1/10th the money.  They just won\u2019t be the guys you heard of on Twitter.  They will be actual experts.  And they will have actual duties to serve you, the client. I\u2019m out. Good luck to all of you.

Each of the board members (except Marvin) is currently employed full time by a different organization, with different goals and reports directly to a boss who has different goals for them.  Each cannot serve both his or her current boss and those businesses while serving the interests of Uniswap.   Most of the board members also serve on lobbying or special interest organisations that have different goals than what is in the best interest of Uniswap.   In addition, several of the board members appear to have been hired by Uniswap in the past to work on legal issues as outside counsel, which creates inherent conflicts on evaluating Uniswap\u2019s current regulatory position and the need for more work (which could be done by them or their previous firms).   Moreover, under the expanded mandate of this proposal, these very board members will be charged with decisions to fund (or not) the other lobbying and special interest organizations that they currently are part of.

Who does Jake serve?  Uniswap or Compound or Variant fund or someone else? Who does Marc serve?  Uniswap or DyDx or ,\u2026? Likewise, who do they support when they push this proposal?

Unfortunately, we are not permitted to post linked or media to show them.  And, it probably doesn\u2019t make sense to start a gotcha witch hunt! More importantly, if you look at their backgrounds, you will quickly see that none (?) of these lawyers has substantial experience with the two biggest legal risks facing DeFi protocols in the US: OFAC risk and Bank Secrecy Act money laundry risk. Likewise, only Katie Biber appears to have experience actually working within government. This is odd. Why this board and not experts in the most important regulations affecting Uniswap and former government officials who have been involved in creating and enforcing these laws? @lex-node @monet-supply ",

We will refer to this fund as the DeFi Defense Fund here, which can be set up as a 501(c)(4) in the US for the greatest flexibility, accountability, and benefits. The temperature check showed massive interest in the topic and almost two-thirds of the votes were in favor of moving forward. The biggest concern\u2014raised by those both voting yes and no\u2014was the lack of precise details. We planned to unveil more details in the Consensus Check as the next stage in this process, and do so here. We address the other concerns raised at the end of this post and plan to respond to concerns as they come up during this Consensus Check. This proposal is both a response to external threats and a preemptive action taken to ensure the sustainability of Uniswap\u2014and DeFi more broadly\u2014for the long-term. Decentralized finance is increasingly under regulatory scrutiny, and we need to defend the ecosystem, its democratizing potential, and its decentralization ideals. To date, decentralized non-custodial protocols have logically been exempted from regulatory obligations designed for custodial financial intermediaries. But now governments and international organizations are considering policies that may halt the innovation, expanded access, and transparency it enables. Similar organizations were essential to protecting the Internet from regulatory threats that would have destroyed the internet\u2019s potential long ago. Over the decades, legal advocates had to win the US Supreme Court case \u201cReno v. ACLU\u201d in 1996 (without which most websites would have had to verify that their viewers were over 18 and exclude minors), the Comcast-BitTorrent case in 2008 (without which the largest cable companies would have continued to block peer-to-peer protocols), the SOPA/PIPA bill in 2012 (which, had it passed, would have stifled web 2.0 by targeting platforms for user-generated content), and even the Apple-FBI case in 2015 (where the US government asserted the right to force companies to write new code for increased surveillance). Without these and other wins\u2013by lawyers, advocates, and technologists\u2013the internet could have never reached its potential. As the most prominent and successful automated market maker protocol, Uniswap will not only receive legal and political questions but also will be well-positioned to lead the defense against rushed proposals that would restrict individuals\u2019 ability to use DeFi protocols or attempt to obligate governance token holders to adopt changes that would fundamentally undermine the promise of decentralized finance. We recommend that Uniswap governance allocate funds to set up a 501(c)(4) \u201cpolicymaking machine\u201d with the goals of 1) preempting regulatory, legal, political, and tax threats to decentralized finance; 2) achieving regulatory clarity for decentralized finance and related activity; 3) advancing laws that support decentralized finance and decentralized governance; and 4) spurring other DeFi protocols\u2019 governance bodies to contribute to the effort (through this organization or their own). The DeFi Defense Fund would fund all of the following: 1) Thought leadership: we need more think tanks and academics to write policy white papers, articles, and op-eds explaining the benefits of decentralized finance; 2) Legal firepower: we need to develop strong legal arguments ahead of enforcement actions or new regulations that threaten DeFi; 3) Top advocates: we need more people directly educating legislative and regulatory policymakers about DeFi and advocating for policy positions that favor DeFi; 4) Messaging: We need to better formulate ideas, prepare spokespeople, and communicate to policymakers and the general public the promise of DeFi; 5) Grassroots advocacy: we need to make it easy for individuals who already care about DeFi to voice their opinions to Congress and regulations. Advocacy campaigns usually require a combination of all of these working in concert. Due to the importance of this work to the Uniswap community and the cost of doing this work well, we propose funding the DeFi Defense Fund with 1M UNI tokens. We expect the committee to allocate these funds over 4-5 years. Outline of this post  The regulatory threat Doing nothing is not an option The Uniswap community is best positioned to lead the effort to protect decentralized finance About the DeFi political defense organization Addressing questions raised in the Temperature Check Snap poll  The regulatory threat Governments\u2019 financial supervisory regimes are generally based on the regulation of financial intermediaries (think banks, stock exchanges, money transmitters, etc.). To date, decentralized finance protocols like the Uniswap protocol have generally been excluded from these regulatory regimes because users of the protocols retain \u201ctotal independent control\u201d over their assets and the protocols have been treated more like the Bitcoin, Ethereum, or HTTP protocols. For example, in the United States, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)\u2014the agency responsible for implementing the Bank Secrecy Act\u2014has said that when a cryptocurrency \u201c\u2026trading platform only provides a forum where buyers and sellers of [cryptocurrency] post their bids and offers and the parties themselves settle any matched transactions through an outside venue (either through individual wallets or other wallets not hosted by the trading platform), the trading platform does not qualify as a money transmitter under FinCEN regulations.\u201d This conclusion makes sense and is worth defending. Unfortunately, governments and international organizations are considering whether to move away from this relatively clear delineation of what is and is not a regulatable activity and essentially seek to \u201cshift the goal posts\u201d in order to capture decentralized finance protocols\u2014and their governance token holders\u2014as \u201cregulatable entities.\u201d For example, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international organization that aims to coordinate countries\u2019 anti-money laundering regimes, essentially suggests that decentralized finance doesn\u2019t exist at all: \u201cWhere customers can access a financial service, it stands to reason that some party has provided that financial service, even if the act of providing it was temporary or shared among multiple parties\u201d\u2014such as governance token holders. The FATF suggests also that \u201c\u2026launching a self-propelling infrastructure to offer VASP services is the same as offering them, and similarly commissioning others to build the elements of an infrastructure, is the same as building them.\u201d Switzerland is already proposing to expand the definition of money transmission to include the \u201cenabling\u201d of funds transfers\u2014even when there is no intermediary taking custody of a customer\u2019s funds\u2014and so may capture decentralized financial protocols in their financial supervisory regime (and this definition may even capture Bitcoin and Ethereum). Doing nothing is not an option \u201cIf we do nothing proactive, governments will develop proposals modeled on TradFi regulation that was developed for different systems in a different time and with wholly different risks. \u201cDoing nothing\u201d will lead to \u201cdoing ineffective, irrelevant activities mandated by regulators because they were not yet properly educated.\u201d The enormous costs of this potential future are much less likely to materialize if we invest resources in a defense fund\u2014a modest cost by comparison. If governance of DeFi protocols is to survive long term, we need to actively engage in the policymaking discussions happening right now to ensure the interests and positions of millions of DeFi users are represented. The Uniswap community is best positioned to lead the effort to protect decentralized finance Decentralized and non-custodial exchange over the internet is a net benefit to society that should be embraced by societies seeking to advance economic flourishing and individual liberty. The Uniswap protocol is universally recognized as the leading and most successful automated market maker protocol in the DeFi ecosystem. Uniswap v3 and v2 each have more volume than any other automated market maker protocol. The broader Uniswap community includes many of the crypto ecosystem\u2019s most thoughtful leaders, both institutions and individuals, and the community prioritized properly resourcing the UNI Community Treasury from day one. We have the technological leadership, community, and human and financial resources to win this policy debate over the foundational principle underlying not only automated market makers and decentralized finance, but crypto generally. About the DeFi political defense organization In light of the expense of hiring sophisticated lobbyists, lawyers, and experts, and in light of the urgent threat we see from poorly informed regulatory proposals globally, we recommend an initial infusion of 1 million UNI (less than one-quarter of one percent of the treasury). This entity will not replicate the great work of existing organizations such as Coin Center, Fight for the Future, the Blockchain Association, the Crypto Council for Innovation, the Defi Alliance, Blockchain for Europe, or others. Rather, it would fund these and other organizations to expand their capabilities to be able to more effectively protect DeFi. It would fund across areas including thought leadership, legal analysis, policy advocacy, messaging, and grassroots. Further, this fund will extend its monetary impact by conditioning some of its grants with matching by other governance treasuries, crypto foundations, or crowd-matching. Grants administration for political spending is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated, and thus we propose a grants committee overseen by an accountable entity. This committee would hire a grants-making leader or staff and create an efficient, predictable process for applicants. We propose the following as committee members, with a subset of them serving as the entity\u2019s board of directors. All have expressed their willingness to join the committee:   Jake Chervinsky , General Counsel, Compound Labs & Strategic Advisor, Variant Fund. Jake serves as general counsel at Compound Labs and as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center.  Larry Sukernik , co-founder, Reverie. Larry co-founded Reverie to steward the development of DAOs. Previously, he was an investor at Digital Currency Group.  Rebecca Rettig , General Counsel, Aave Companies. Rebecca is a well-known DeFi lawyer who has advocated before government bodies around the world. Aave is based in Europe so she can help ensure connectivity with European based groups.  Marc Boiron , General Counsel, dYdX Trading. Marc is a DeFi attorney who has designed the regulatory strategies and DAO structures for many of the leading DeFi protocols in addition to having educated regulators on DeFi.  Marvin Ammori , Chief Legal Officer of Uniswap Labs. Marvin has spent his career advocating for new technologies from the internet to DeFi. He has served as a board member of multiple advocacy nonprofits.  Katie Biber , Chief Legal Officer of Brex, Board of Directors of Anchorage. Katie is a fintech and crypto leader and political superlawyer who served as the General Counsel of the Mitt Romney presidential campaign in 2012.  Sheila Warren , World Economic Forum, Executive Committee (Cryptocurrency Lead). Sheila is trained as a lawyer who used to represent 501(c)(4) nonprofits such as Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. She now convenes experts on cryptocurrency regulatory issues at WEF.  These committee members skew towards legal advocates for their expertise in policy formation and analysis and towards US residents as the US plays an outsized role in global financial regulation. We expect that some members will be able to serve pro bono and that the total compensation across the entire committee will be less than $150K per year. Due to the dynamic and somewhat unpredictable state of global policy proposals, we believe the grant-making committee should have considerable discretion, subject to the necessary disclosure of its activities. Addressing questions raised in the Temperature Check Some concerns were raised in the Temperature Check.   Will a student group control these funds? We propose the committee named above, which includes some of the top thinkers and lawyers in DeFI across multiple top projects. In Temperature Check, several people assumed that the Harvard Law Blockchain and Fintech Initiative would control these funds, and we should have been clearer that this was never the intent of our proposal.  Why isn\u2019t the budget small? Top lawyers, lobbyists, and educational public relations campaigns are very expensive. When the US Treasury Department proposed a \u201cmidnight rulemaking\u201d in December, blockchain advocacy organizations were forced to spend millions in just a few months on agency comments and prepared litigation. Given the complexity and novelty of these issues, we need the world\u2019s best talent, and many of them are paid more than professional athletes. The committee will be best positioned to allocate these funds dynamically in response to threats and opportunities. Given the current proposals, the industry needs funding sizable enough to support the multi-front campaign on multiple issues.  Considerable transparency will be ensured. There are considerable public reporting requirements for both 501(c)(4) organizations\u2013regarding grant size and recipients\u2013and also separately for any lobbying expenditures. Further, we expect this committee (and independently others in the community) to provide plain language summaries of these disclosures. Board members of 501(c)(4) organizations are also fiduciaries required by law to act not in their own interest but in the organization\u2019s best interest.  Free-riding can be mitigated but is not worth any upfront delay. In this ecosystem, many of us get to free ride off of one another\u2019s software contributions (e.g., Uniswap governance is a fork of Compound governance, all of DeFi benefits from Ethereum development). Groups also free-ride off of policy contributions. DeFi has benefited from expensive and time-consuming efforts of Coin Center, the Ethereum Foundation, and others as they educated policy makers and defended Bitcoin and Ethereum against attacks for many years. As noted, we expect the committee over time to condition grants on matching funds raised by other affected communities. Further, more funds will be needed over time if DeFi continues to grow\u2014just as internet freedom organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation remain busy and have expanded over time\u2014and we expect other communities will contribute as they wake up to additional threats and rushed proposals targeting them directly. The need for this funding organization is too urgent to delay over negotiating free-riding concerns, and we expect those concerns to be mitigated in months, not years.  The grants would go far beyond lobbying. Nobody likes lobbyists. We get it. But to properly educate policymakers in a way that defends DeFi, the organization would provide some funding to lobbyists and more to the workstreams described above: (1) thought leadership, (2) legal firepower, (3) top policy advocates (some of whom would be \u201clobbying\u201d on specific bills and some would be more generally educational), (4) messaging, and (5) grassroots advocacy.

                    "content": "It was indeed confusing that a proposal, already open for votes, was titled \u201cConsensus Check\u201d. Maybe it would be wise to not skip the consensus exploration stage, and really, meaningfully engage in it. I guess that would require that you remove the voting prospect altogether for now, and avoid the extreme urgency aesthetics (as if something spectacular could be done on the next day upon voting \u201cyes\u201d) when consensus for 30M is sought. At least until the community has indeed had a chance to explore consensus and assess the implications of this on several levels. People may not know what to vote. The \u201cGive 1 M UNI to an NGO that has not been formed yet and without even a sample institution document ready to indicate its structure, decision making process etc\u201d or \u201cdo nothing for DeFi\u201d is a pseudo-dilemma. The \u201cdo-nothing\u201d option averts those who want to say no from engaging in the voting procedure, because the \u201cdo-nothing\u201d does not express their stance. Maybe a \u201cnot like THAT\u201d option would be more appropriate. I would vote for \"in the right direction, but a lot more needed for saying yes to (part of) it. I definitely believe something should be done to defend DeFi but the proposal, as it is presented, is unacceptably -even shockingly- vague. As paired to the extremely high sum sought for, a \u201cskip the step of consensus\u201d move, together with the numbness associated to the high sum sought for, might resemble a coup. Many questions arise and deserve answers for people to engage in an enlightened manner in acts that affect their situation, their UNI and that of UNI as a whole. You actually say that these few people will be controlling the money to give it to projects and lobbyists. Well. Why can\u2019t the community do that directly, when projects of interest are brought for support? How much will the NGO registration cost and how long will it take for it to function properly? Where will its offices be? Will it have offices in other cities or continents? How much will these cost? A breakdown on basic expenses would be useful. How will people enter the NGO as members? What are the requirements? For example, if I want to be a member, will I be able to? How will they vote about what happens with UNI\u2019s 1 M (or whatever)? Will the BD be steady or new persons entering might overturn it and take control of the funds\u2019 allocation? If a member of the BD does not act in alignment with the aims, what will happen? Will other members be proposed as replacement? Will that be the case in advance? Who will have responsibility for the NGO\u2019s potential debts? How will the finances of the NGO be checked? The allocation of funds will be approved by the community or the plan is to put aside some millions and completely trust the BD for their allocation without requesting approval on the road? Btw, \u201cPaying or hiring politicians\u201d to do this or that, can be seen as illegal  or outrageous. Anyone who has access to this page might use this in a not so nice manner. It definitely cannot be part of a statute, as a means to promote an aim. Lobbying is not bribery, of course, but it does have, in many jurisdictions, complex rules. It may leave a door half open to harassment and have legal implications not only on those engaging in it actively, but also on those funding it. Mobilisation for DeFi Defense is in the right direction. But it is not ok that the project is promoted in this manner and the community pressurized to decide \u201cyesterday\u201d. You are asking the community to trust your project blindly. However, this may affect their rights and obligations, as well as their assets. You have to be far more specific and document the costs.

As an organization, we\u2019ve been engaged in some form of policy/advocacy, either directly or indirectly, since early 2016. Our efforts have historically taken several forms, namely direct advocacy through our own contracted policy experts, industry associations, or self-advocacy. Though useful in some contexts, we found the first two modalities of advocacy miss the mark in terms of our aspirations. Contracted policy rarely works well because our industry is complex and the technology moves so rapidly. For this reason, you spend a lot of time educating your own advocates and by the time they deliver the message the goal posts have already moved. Industry associations are terrific for very big picture items, but less fantastic for nuanced policy, particularly when you have the biggest backers of industry associations largely being centralized exchanges and bitcoin supporters, whose policy goals are at times inverse to that of DeFi/Ethereum. There is also an issue of attention span for those industry groups, and DeFi advocacy is not a trivial amount of work - it\u2019s something requiring intense focus. We see this initiative as checking a number of boxes. Chiefly, those who will be tasked with the advocacy are themselves the foremost legal/policy experts on the technology itself. Second, I do not see concerns of competing interests or advocacy points. There are underlying thematic points of agreement among all participants - and the group should be able to work in unison to achieve a collectively beneficial outcome. Third, time is of the essence on these issues. At ConsenSys, we believe education to provide understanding to lawmakers is of critical importance at this juncture - particularly as we creep towards true aspirational \u201cmain street\u201d use of our technologies. Lastly, as communicated by @marcboiron - the non-profit structure will be hugely beneficial to concerns around use of funds. There should be supreme transparency due to that. Though not an expert on these things, we did a bit of analysis when forming the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and there are some benefits to a 501(c)(6) that may also be worth exploring. In sum, this is a terrific effort and Uniswap taking the first step could break the flood gates of other large treasuries supporting this (or similar) initiatives. In my view, the two best uses for community funds are 1) things that drive real life use of the technology, and 2) simultaneous advocacy. Therefore, we will be supporting this and have already communicated to our portfolio companies our wish that they consider doing the same. Matt Corva, General Counsel for ConsenSys Software Inc. ",

However, we believe there are some issues that must be raised and deliberated over before integrating this proposal into Uniswap:  There needs to be specific details on reporting to $UNI holders/measures to make operations transparent. Though the US Government may mandate reporting requirements for 501(c)(4) organizations, there has to be a mechanism to ensure tokenholders receive these reporting requirements\u2014not everyone knows how to navigate through SEC filings. One idea might be to report the group\u2019s spending/initiatives/activities on a monthly/quarterly basis via e.g. a Medium article. There needs to be a specific breakdown on the lock-up and release schedule of the 1M in $UNI allocated to the grant. Right now, details are vague (4-5 years), without a precise understanding of how much money the committee will have to work with at certain points. Also, a discussion should be had about whether the absolute amount will be refined if funding requirements differ from expectations. Specific proposals for actionable utilization of capital should be discussed before execution of proposal. For example, more details about how outreach to other DeFi communities will occur would be greatly appreciated.  ",

While I agree long-term the amount could be considered reasonable for these requirements, it is too much to ask for upfront without having phase-gates / milestones for demonstrated impact, and with oversight under the committee model, only one Uniswap Labs employee would be involved. Further, the proposal articulates no on-going accountability mechanisms tied to Uniswap governance. It\u2019s not hard to imagine an effort like this starts with funding from Uniswap and quickly diverges from needs tied to the protocol / project over the course of a few years. I would propose that instead a budget for one year of operation be allocated (i.e., ~1/5 of the requested amount of UNI), with follow-up requests each year as appropriate. IMO, this would be a more reasonable ask than requesting ~$30M of UNI upfront.   During that one year period, a key part of the operating plan should be to bootstrap funding from additional DeFi projects. On the proposed board, I see leaders from several other projects. The goal should be to solicit funds from each of these DAOs (and others) so this effort represents a consortium effort across DeFi. I would also be open to an effort more focused on Uniswap; however, the way in which this proposal is written is still quite broad focused on lobbying needs across DeFi.   ",

That being said, Blockchain at UCLA will support this proposal as we believe the benefits outweight the risks. Coordination among influential individuals in the corporate legal setting to champion a defi project such as Uniswap would bring value to the ecosystem as a whole, and this is a good first step towards that vision. Frontier industries which rapidly gain mainstream adoption will undoubtedly experience growing pains, not to mention regulatory risks when considering a topic such as decentralizing finance. Judgement will inevitably be cast upon the industry, the question is whether or not it will be favorable. In terms of allocation, there is 172m UNI scheduled to be allocated in the first year alone to the treasury. We believe 1m UNI, while risky in its current format, is a reasonable enough allocation for the intent of the proposal. ",

                    "content": "Re-positng here from the other (non copied chain) Most law school students take a class called \u201cCorporations.\u201d The key innovation behind the corporate is the separation of ownership from control \u2013 i.e., the shareholders own the company, but the board and management directly control it. This leads to the key problem you study in a law school corporations class: how do you regulate the actions of the board (and management) when they are not the owners of the company, and can potentially do things that help themselves, but screw the shareholders? Usually, the ** bedrock principal is that the board should act on behalf of the owners. In fact, it has fiduciary duties to act that way under Delaware and most state corporate laws.** Most of the case law you study revolves around this issue. For example, if the chairman of the board wants to take the company private, how do you set up the process? Or, if a member of the board wants the company to do a deal with a related party, how do you regulate that? The usual answer is through hard and soft regulation, including forming a special committee that does not include the interested board member, securing fairness opinions from banks and accounting firms, and following a number of protective processes to prevent abuse. For a governance token, this is probably supposed to play out with the members of the DAO or the management listening to what the governance token holders direct. So, what is going on here? [Removed picture of HLSBFI saying on Twitter that regulators won\u2019t listen to token holders\u2026and positioning themselves as who regulators will listen to] What is my governance token worth \u2026 \u2026 if an interested party can propose and lead the vote to take funds from the treasury? \u2026 if the people who are directing the funds are opening saying the budget\u2019s targets will not listen to what we, as governance token holders want? So, @haydenadams - Does HLS Block Fi work for Uniswap governance token holders? Uniswap equity holders? Or for themselves? How about after 1m Uni are drained from the Uniswap treasury and placed in a separate fund that none of us (including you) have any control over, and is proposed to be created with literally no governance? This would stink to high heaven under Delaware corporate law. And HLSBFI surely knows this. Then, of course, there is the size of the budget.  It is more than Uniswap has spent to build it\u2019s entire product.  It is 10x what a major bank has disclosed as its lobbying budget in a regulatory filing. We both deserve answers here. And we deserve to delegate our votes to a party who works for Uniswap\u2019s token holders.  Not for themselves and the people related to them ",

It may, it may not. This form of non profit allows the members to conduct considerable amount of lobbying though. However, there is a caveat to it. 501 ( c)(4 ) main activity cannot be lobbying solely. So in this case, the DeFi educational fund would have to classify its main activity as something else than purely lobbying. This might result in additional costs? I mean, this is just such a huge undertaking that I am starting to think its futile for Uniswap to take on this challenge alone. I like the core idea, but the execution of the idea is just insanely hard, costly, and protracted. This should be a stand alone project with separate funding etc. So all in all, if they manage to get the 501 (c)(4), I dont think taxes could be applicable ",

As it is now, it looks more like a trust fund than a donation to a non profit. Which fall under different legal provisions and have different fiscal treatment in most jurisdictions. However, I don\u2019t see the main problem there, but to the activity, the true aim promoted by the non profit. If a legal person engages in lobbying, then the activity may not be tax deductible and the true aim of the organization may be deemed as latently promoting profit. It is not so difficult to assume that, since anyone can have access to the discussions here. This is why we said it is important that those promoting the proposal inter alia present an assurance that part of the fund will not be consumed by taxes. I am still waiting for an answer to this question, but I don\u2019t see any. A sample charter should also be presented, so that we check it out. I guess they will do it at the next stage. Or they are too certain that the funds can exit the Uniswap budget without much info being diffused, in which case many of us will draw the inferences we deem appropriate\u2026 On the other hand, this is also why I insisted that the \u201crights & freedom\u201d approach is important to be pivotal (and that the lack of any such specialists in the BD is striking). Because it will be really difficult for any State to tax a non profit for an activity promoting and upholding fundamental rights and freedom (or engaging in education), even if it involves lobbying.
