                    "content": " Introduction As discussed on recent calls, the governance process has become less consistent and less secure than is ideal for MakerDAO and the Maker Protocol. We considered two solutions to this issue, Governance Rewards, and Delegation. Based on the complexity and danger of Governance Rewards, we have chosen to focus on Delegation as the near-term solution to the recent issues.  What to expect Over the next few weeks, @hexonaut and @Derek will be coordinating the required smart contracts and front-end work to allow delegated voting in the Maker Protocol. We are pursuing a simple and robust implementation that can be implemented quickly in both the Smart Contracts and UI domains.  Smart Contracts A delegate voting contract can be created by any address. The creating address becomes the permanent delegate for that contract. Once a delegate voting contract is created, anyone (including the delegate) can add MKR to the contract at any time. Any address that has added MKR to the delegate contract may withdraw the same amount of MKR at any time. The delegate address only has the ability to vote with the MKR locked in the contract. It does not have the power to move the MKR at all - even to return it to the owners. Users who lock their MKR into the delegate contract will also be able to take advantage of governance rewards when / if they are implemented. Each delegate contract will be able to vote in both on-chain polls and executives.  User Interface The interface will be available on vote.makerdao.com and will display a list of official (constructed via a factory contract, so that voters can trust that the delegation contracts are legitimate) delegation contracts. MKR Holders may select any address from this list and delegate their MKR to that address. MKR Holders will also be able to withdraw their MKR from their delegate using this interface. Delegates will be able to vote on polls and executives using existing user interfaces.  Governance GovAlpha will be working to ensure that there is a solid set of initial delegates for MKR Holders to choose from when delegating their MKR. We will reach out to those that display interest and together arrive at some guidelines and best practices for being a delegate. In later UI versions, information on each (willing) delegate will be collected by GovAlpha and displayed prominently on the UI. We hope to keep track of and display metrics such as:  Incentive Alignment (to the Maker Protocol) Attention (voting frequently, staying engaged) Communication (communicating reasoning effectively)  By doing this, we hope that we can ensure delegate quality and safety for MKR Holders that don\u2019t have a personal or professional connection to their chosen delegate. We imagine that these metrics will become important for any publicly accessible delegate within MakerDAO to maintain. These metrics (or lack thereof) will never be used to prevent delegates from voting. GovAlpha will also be producing guidelines for both delegates and MKR Holders communicating both expectations for delegates and what MKR Holders should look for and think about when choosing one or more delegates.  Are you interested in being a delegate? If you are interested in being a delegate please reach out to me publicly or privately. ",

As MKR holders, we\u2019ve been waiting for Vote Delegation for a while now - as we consider it a pre-requisite to our ability to participate actively in governance. Because of this, we\u2019ve been highly active on Compound and Aave governance (for example), but not on Maker despite our desire to do so. On the sample metrics laid out in the OP (Alignment, Attention, Communication), I believe we\u2019d rate highly on all 3 once this is implemented. Happy to state here publicly @LongForWisdom that we would be interested in being a delegate, even if only to support ourselves. Also noting here that custodial requirements for larger / institutional investors may present a challenge for them to participate more actively. Once the initial work of enabling delegated voting is done, there\u2019s another layer of work still required for major custodians / exchanges (ex. Coinbase Custody, BitGo, etc.) to integrate the process. Happy to push on that front as well. ",

This isn\u2019t really around groupthink, but more around alignment to the long-term success of the protocol. This can come in several forms. The table below represents some of our current thinking, though I don\u2019t consider it an exhaustive list.     Alignment Source + Type     Holds MKR Extrinsic - Financial   Holds vested MKR Extrinsic - Financial   Paid percentage of revenue Extrinsic - Financial   Maker Protocol is primary employment Extrinsic - Financial   Being a delegate delivers status + prestige Extrinsic - Reputational   Enjoys delegate work Intrinsic   Maker Protocol benefits society Intrinsic    We have been considering how stable these incentives are over a longer time period as well. For example holding MKR shows alignment at the time a delegate is observed to hold MKR. Owning vested MKR would show a longer term alignment. ",

I also want to throw whatever marginal influence I have behind someone who both prioritizes the long- run health/profitability over the short, and who will also be a bulldog about ongoing governance. My experience in more centralized companies is that those who get approved to start new programs tend to be high quality and followed by those who increasingly add little value for the cost, but who are then entrenched and able to extract resources from the organization. We have a fresh start here and I want \u201cdecentralized\u201d to mean not beholden to non-MKR holder interests, as opposed to a capture by management or employees. Anyway, I might have higher wishes than will be delivered upon, but a few AMA posts by would-be delegates would definitely attract interaction from me. Delegation isn\u2019t just a tool to save on gas/time. It\u2019s a tool for groups of MKR holders to form voting blocs to push in the direction they feel is best ",

I check in on votes/polls weekly, have the capability to vote regularly (for the most part). As a delegate my intention would be simply to make direction choices, occasionally offer suggestions for change, and to secure the protocol generally for both vault users and DAI holders. Happy to put up my reasoning and positions on votes before I vote, and discussion positions, etc.   Perhaps a format for a Delegate Platform that has Q/A that might be a useful way for Delegates seeking to distinguish themselves to inform the MKR holders seeking to delegate their MKR.   I may noodle on this and offer up a forum post on the subject.  If someone beats me to it, all the better. Time and detail involved would probably be directly related to potential compensation or lack there-of. ",

Thanks for asking this, happy to expand on it. First a caveat - for Pantera, it\u2019s a multi-dimensional decision on whether we participate actively in governance. The ability to delegate is important, but not the only factor. We also consider whether the scope of a protocol\u2019s governance is actually impactful, whether we can have a significant impact, how much operational overhead it would take, any risks or opportunity cost involved, etc. Delegation offers three key things for us:   Security: It\u2019s important that we maintain a consistent security / custody model around our assets. Any voting mechanism that requires us to stretch outside of the base model by moving assets from our provider to a self-custody solution is a risk-reward decision. Not impossible for us to do (though impossible for some funds that have stricter policies), but we\u2019d need to weigh the benefit of casting a vote against the potential risks and it\u2019s rare that a vote is important or controversial enough for us to make that call. As mentioned previously, the optimal state is where our existing custody model enables governance participation natively on their platform. We (Pantera) can manage to make it work without that, but many others can\u2019t.   Privacy: For all of our positions, it\u2019s important that we not reveal too much information about our strategy. At the same time, we\u2019d like our voice to be heard and publicly identifiable. Being able to delegate provides us with more flexibility in how and when we reveal our MKR position. There\u2019s also a minor downside / trade-off to this, which is that we tend to lose our on-chain voting record when we re-delegate to a new address. For example, we\u2019ve voted on 30+ proposals on Compound - the most of any large funds, despite us not being an early-stage investor - but the Compound leaderboard currently shows us as having 7 votes because of a re-delegation.   Convenience: This is a minor one, but just an operational nice-to-have. It\u2019s useful to be able to assign or un-assign voting duties across different team members without shifting our security / wallet management procedures. While I take on the majority of those duties today, I could foresee this being needed as we scale up our governance-related activity.   I realize that much of the above may be unique to us or to professional investors more generally and somewhat strange (or lame) in the context of a decentralized, open protocol. Ultimately, it all extends from the responsibility we take on when we manage others\u2019 assets, which we take as seriously as we can. Hope that all helps!

Far from being a conflict of interest (in most cases - GovAlpha exception noted), it shows that the Units are committed to the security of the Protocol and want to further Dai and the Maker ecosystem. It  shows aligned interests: they are maintaining/promoting Dai directly through their various activities, and supporting the Protocol via governance. If community members don\u2019t want to delegate MKR to a CU because they don\u2019t agree with its stance, fair enough. But if a prospective CU says, \u201cWe\u2019re doing xyz to help the DAO, but we don\u2019t care much about governance\u201d, then unless there\u2019s a specific reason, it\u2019s not a great look. I\u2019d almost hope many CUs offered to become Delegates by default. ",

                    "content": "    LongForWisdom:  GovAlpha will be working to ensure that there is a solid set of initial delegates for MKR Holders to choose from when delegating their MKR.   I\u2019ve been thinking about this and I wondering if it would be a good idea to Ask MKR Token Holders to Nominate a batch of Delegates and allocate (Stake) their MKR to their Nominees based on an Election Algorithm. In other words, if I hold 1,000 MKR and I wanted to delegate them to say @Planet_X \u2014I would interact with the Voting Contract and allocate (stake) my 1,000 MKR to him. But\u2014what if, I wanted to Nominate multiple Delegates with my 1,000 MKR, and I handpicked Planet X, @franklin (Pantera), @psychonaut, and @PaperImperium\u2014but I was not sure if I should do it 25% each? Or, what if I wanted to nominate 70% of my MKR to Planet X and 10% split 3 ways for the rest of my chosen Delegates\u2014plus I think it will take 4 Transactions(I could be wrong)\u2014wouldn\u2019t it be better if we have an Election Algorithm that can make those decisions based on Randomness that will lead to EVEN distribution? Let\u2019s assume 55% of MKR Token Holders love PaperImperium because he\u2019s super active and they don\u2019t know much about Pantera, or they don\u2019t Trust Planet X. There is the possibility the weights can be swung to one-side versus the other. Does that make sense? Objective:  Determine X, Y, and Z such that:  The minimum backed Delegated MKR Stake is Maximize The total number of Delegated MKR is Maximize. The Variance of Delegated Stake is Minimized.   ",
