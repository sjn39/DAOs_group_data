Kukkio:  1.XDAI can not be considered being even close to the same security or trust level as Ethereum mainnet;   DPOS is the only difference that i can tell.  Less nodes maybe less security but would rather experts speak to this.     Kukkio:  2.It is more or less a testing ground;   This is decidedly NOT true.   xDAI is in use now and NOT a testing ground.  It is also rapidly becoming a L2 hub location with bridges not just to Main net, but soon Matic (March latest), and shortly there after Binance Chain.     Kukkio:  3.Risk level is of the charts;   No clue what this means.   Chainlink is also soon going to be release on xDAI so we will have chainlink pricing oracles (namely for agaave).     Kukkio:  4.Playing with peoples money!!! 5.Playing with the Maker name!!!   These are just made up points.   If you think playing with people\u2019s money on xDAI then you could make the same points of Ethereum\u2026 It isn\u2019t just a risk issue but a usability one.    Dust approaching levels that basically make existing small vault liquidations cost too much.  High Main net fees are pretty much pricing the people Maker wanted to serve (the underserved) out of the market. Here is a valid point.    Technically how would Maker Mint DAI for xDAI chain because you can\u2019t just mint DAI on xDAI.  You have to basically mint DAI on mainnet and bridge it in.   But I expect this is easily surmountable by taking part of the surplus and bridging it into xDAI for use by a Maker fork. I think if there was a real point its that a better L2 probably will show up (optimistic) and it might be prudent to wait for that.   I know a lot of development is lining up for optimistic but I also know a lot of L2s are going now (Matic, Binance, xDAI) and xDAI is focused on bridging as well as becoming a L2 hub. Maker can sit and wait and hope main net fees come down or they can decide now to put up an instance somewhere.   Since xDAI is EVM compatible porting should be easiest on xDAI than any other L2.    Development is the primary hitch here and Agave will be released soon on xDAI (everything is ready to go we just need the reliable oracle hooks). Either way DeFI will make it to L2, the real question is whether or when Maker will move there. You also ignore another important point.   Since the token that powers transaction on xDAI is DAI basically fees will always be denominated with tokens that have a fixed value.  100gwei on xDAI is vastly different in cost than 100gwei on ETH.

Vaults in xDAI could be created by small-fishes, who might benefit from having a 100usd worth Vault. And I believe there are plenty of these fishes.

Note that I don\u2019t know much about xDai and questions could have no meaning! But in general, if we deploy in a network simply for users going there and having to come back to Ethereum to do stuff, we\u2019re not solving the issue. IMHO, what is important is to deploy into a network which have DEFI dapps, where you could earn interest on your crypto, with a Uniswap-equivalent, Maker-equivalent, Aave-equivalent, Yearn-equivalent, new projects pumping up constantly. Otherwise we\u2019ll be just spending resources in all this deployment with very low possibility of usage. I\u2019m going to research more, but if these points are not covered, sadly I\u2019ll vote no (and these above would be the reasons). ",

But a database on AWS and BNB works as well until it isn\u2019t. ETH gas fees are not a problem. It is a feature. ETH gas slows the velocity of money on mainnet just enough, that people are not exiting from their ERC20tokenxxx/WETH pools when the market dumps. It just is not worth it, unless you are a whale. But even a whale might be OK with the profit from a pool. The ETH Gas fee also keeps the not qualified investors away.    Should we explore launching on Binance Smart Chain? Venus protocol endangers DAI!   P.S. I also think the High Ethereum TX Fees are protecting the small & new investors from getting hurt. And that\u2019s a good thing. I heard an attorney say it\u2019s like protecting unaccredited investors.   Maker has an instance on ETH Mainnet. It is the most secure, and should have the biggest vaults. But a high velocity of money environment is also needed. And the Maker vaults were a solution for me, when the fees were low (it is still a solution, because i did ride the wave).

I am not even sure MANA is listed in the default token list.   I own some of that but really have not seen a reason to move my liquidity to xDAI yet. So yes liquidity is still bootstrapping and as volume comes LP returns will increase and this will enable more liquidity and volume.  Even uniswap had to start somewhere.

Now is in a stampede, it has gone from millions to 10 billions in less than 1 month. We sadly cannot have the influence that Binance had over their users, because not many users in fact uses our interface to interact with MakerDAO (and now is even less probable that they do anything there - GAS and DUST to blame). This was told before and IMHO the first step we gave causing us loosing influence over retail investors (many of them probably flying toward BSC now) was a lack of solidification of our UI / UX. I don\u2019t think that it is late though, I propose to reach out the teams in Defisaver and Instadapp, probably the bigger platforms being used to access MakerDAO vaults?, and if we manage to compromise them to help us to promote xDai through their platforms (after we deploy something there of course), then I think we have a good chance to start gaining traction again. With proper UI preparation in those platforms (and in oasis.app) we could route the users toward a deployment in xDai. We\u2019re not guarantee to succeed, but if we don\u2019t try, we\u2019ll don\u2019t have even a chance to know. ",

We should talk with xDAI devs, and definitely push xDAI adoption as much as we can, even if potentially this will not be the final L2 solution. Something we could concretely do, right now is:  start a xDAI core unit. add liquidity to xDAI (e.g., we could bridge 10m DAI + 10m USDC and LP them on honeyswap). start a Validator node on xDAI (this gets us rewards). pay Sourcecred in xDAI. etc  All of the above require no Smart-Contract knowledge. Of course it would be super cool to have some SC development as well. Like moving Governance and/or Vault creation over there. That would be awesome. ",

There\u2019s lots of exciting stuff now happening on xdai, and with us setting up connext bridges to all the L2 solution we may even be able to have Maker on matic, Maker on polkadot, Maker on bsc too (why not I guess). I believe the rapidly approaching future belongs to L2s and L2 cross-chain aggregation. The window of opportunity is still here, but it\u2019s rapidly closing. There are lots of projects now clamoring to be the powerhouses of L2. I don\u2019t think bsc is it. I just think they\u2019re the canary in the coal mine. ",

Long term this might not be enough to attract the best of the industrie talent. The Maker DAO might be able to attract the best of the best, but some serious monetary incentives are key. The Maker protocol  might be able to finance some limited number of skilled people/organisations (the foundation included). A representative democracy of sorts could be a long term solution. ",
