Whats the advantage to giving your votes to someone else unless you have large amounts of trust and/or arent going to participate in voting, esp in the early stages of governance? Personally I had no idea I had to even self delegate to have my votes count, I thought they would be self delgated automatically. At at any rate, to be truly decentralized, we need our votes to count. Spread the word for all UNI holders to self delegate. ",

Best would be if everyone could research everything but that just isn\u2019t realistic. Autonomous proposals would fix nr.1 Generally risk could be greatly reduced by having simple proposals that only do one thing at a time\u2026 ",
