This also allows more focused discussion on individual topics. For example, the Union/Onion vs normalized type discussion does not affect withdrawals. And the SSZ Optional may be useful irrespective of the root format in the execution block header, e.g., for EIP-4844. However, I can also understand the desire to see all changes on 1 page, though. Hopefully, once the PRs are merged, Core | Ethereum Improvement Proposals can be used to regain that overview. ",
