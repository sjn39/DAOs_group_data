ParaFi Capital   Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Yearn.finance (\u201cyEarn\u201d) is a DeFi yield aggregator and optimizer. yEarn uses a suite of DeFi protocols and primitives including yTokens and delegated vaults to maximize yield. YFI is yEarn\u2019s governance token. YFI is an ERC-20 token used to vote on yEarn improvement plans (\u201cYIPs\u201d) and new yield strategies for liquidity providers. Token holders can stake their YFI through the governance portal to earn a percentage of fees generated by the protocol.   Provide a brief history of the project. yEarn was launched in early 2020 and initially optimized yield across Compound, dydx, Aave, and Fulcrum. yEarn has continued to add new DeFi products including yleverage.finance and ypool.finance. In mid-July 2020, yEarn announced the release of the YFI token. Given the number of configurable parameters in yEarn, the YFI token is used by the community to govern the protocol. There was no pre-mine, sale, or allocation for investors/team. YFI was only earned by providing liquidity. 30,000 YFI tokens were minted and have been fully earned/distributed among the community. The community is currently working with firms such as Delphi Digital and Gauntlet to construct an optimal token model and inflation schedule. A 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig has been granted full rights over the YFI governance contract. YIP 40 proposes replacing inactive multisig signers with four new signers. Since the launch of YFI, yEarn has grown from $8M to over $1 billion in total value locked (\u201cTVL\u201d).   Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses.

Token holders can vote on YIPs and stake YFI to earn fees generated by the protocol.   Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral?

YFI trades on decentralized exchanges including Uniswap and Balancer, as well as centralized exchanges including Binance and FTX.   ",

Yes, YFI is relatively new and is still in price discovery mode which brings about a certain amount of risk.  However, given Maker\u2019s collateral onboarding times (polls -> executive -> implemented by smart contracts team), I am guessing this might stabilize even further by the time we get there. This is a similar situation to COMP being voted in which has stabilized relative to when it was first discussed on the forum (and is still not useable collateral). Re: risk paramaters, I would use  risk parameters from tokens like LINK, LEND, REN, and COMP to inform YFI (Have these been discussed yet?)   Doesn\u2019t seem like we have to reinvent the wheel here when it comes to Risk, YFI is basically a DeFi governance token you can stake. ",

Once we vote in yETH vaults, we will see how much of an effect their protocol has on ours which may help further inform our decision.

It\u2019s not the Foundation that decides (or even opines on) what potential collateral types to add. Instead, Domain Teams, those individuals elected by the community and granted a mandate to act, may discern the order of collateral types they want to work on. But they don\u2019t decide what to work on; only you, the decentralized group of MKR holders who control the Protocol, do. While the DAO continually looks for more external Domain Teams to take up the mantle, for now, there is an overlap between members of the Domain Teams and employees of the Foundation. Although that requires us, the mandated actors, to wear multiple hats, we endeavor to act without bias when ordering collateral types for domain review. Practically that means we isolate ourselves from non-Domain Team members when discussing the order of assets to review as part of the onboarding process. More importantly, it means that we do not engage with or take guidance from non-Domain Team Foundation members. And it means that we work to make the domain team meetings, explained more below, transparent to the community. These meetings are attended by @LongForWisdom, the Governance Facilitator, and by @juan, a community aid, who compiles and publishes summaries to the Maker Forum. Ultimately, the goal here is to inform the community about potential collateral types in the pipeline. While there isn\u2019t a fixed methodology, the Domain Teams incorporate the following matrix when coming to a consensus around collateral onboarding: \u201cWhich potential collateral does the community want to see added (greenlight polls)?\u201d \u201cWhich potential collateral has the biggest potential to generate the most Dai?\u201d \u201cWhich potential collateral is the easiest to implement, thereby enabling more collateral to be onboarded?\u201d \u201cWhich potential collateral type would help diversify the collateral portfolio backing Dai? (e.g. gold, rwa) \u201cWhich potential collateral type has unique properties that may help stabilize the peg (e.g. stablecoins)? \u201cIs there significant smart contract risk to onboarding a collateral due to how new it is? These are all competing priorities, and coming up with collateral types that satisfy all of these goals is impossible. The Domain Teams understand that the collateral onboarding process can seem frustrating at times when your favorite Defi token isn\u2019t getting added with the urgency you think it deserves. That said, take a step back and do not overlook the forest for the trees. Onboarding a single token as collateral in +/- two months will not make or break the Maker Protocol. But it is critical to establish a regular and sustainable cadence for collateral onboarding, because future Domain Teams, mandated actors and community members will look to what we are doing today as a guide for how they will act tomorrow.

The misconception you point is maybe on the influence the Foundation has on your work (item 2 and 3 below). Both ways (and everything between) are okay to me.    Adding a poll to prioritize collateral applications   Directing Domain Teams As it stands, domain teams are specifically not required to work on the collateral that MKR Holders most want them to work on (at least at this stage where they are not being paid by the protocol.) Community sentiment towards an asset is meant to be one of the inputs into their decision of what to work on, but not the only input. There are three reasons we made this decision when writing the collateral on-boarding process (which the collateral onboarding MIPs are ultimately based on).  The domain teams have a much better understanding of the risks and ease-of-onboarding within their domain. This lets them prioritise more sensibly to achieve maximum throughput. In the current state of affairs the Maker Foundation pays the domain teams salary, realistically this gives them control of what the domain teams work on, and you can\u2019t hand-wave this away regardless of what you write in a MIP. Asking people to work on things they don\u2019t believe in is a bad idea. It hurts morale, and you end up with work of a lower quality. In the future there is also the possibility of multiple teams within a single domain that have different specialisations. It doesn\u2019t make sense to force a team to work on something they have no experience with.  On the current approach The current approach is not \u2018first come first served.\u2019 The current approach leaves the decision up to the domain teams as to what they work on each month.   ",

Onboarding new collateral types isn\u2019t as quick or easy as whitelisting a new address for one of the oracles. Even if the community did signal to onboard YFI immediately, the domain teams would still need to do domain evaluations of the collateral before it could be onboarded. In practice, we have not done this outside of emergency situations. I would strongly recommend against trying to onboard new collateral outside of the process, absent an emergency. ",
