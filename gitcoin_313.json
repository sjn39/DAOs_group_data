Our two Allo-focused outcomes are:\nEnable Payouts v1\nEngage the developer community\n\nGrants Stack: The primary goal in S17 is productizing QF rounds on Grants Stack. We received valuable feedback during our alpha period and want to focus on addressing so both our Grants Program and self-serve customers can run successful QF rounds. Our outcomes are:\nImprove the project application and review flows\nBuild a project reputation system\nProvide an easy, intuitive QF round experience\n\nOur request is to have funding to fulfill these objectives as outlined in our governance post. Gitcoin Allo (GA) is requesting $803,533 for S17, and we plan to maintain a standard reserve of 60%. Due to price increases from when the S16 budget was funded, absorbing the Moonshot Collective treasury, and strong diversification, we are actually only requesting roughly 165K GTC ($290K) this season to maintain our full budget and reserves.\n\n*The GTC total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally. In this post, we used a $1.75 conversion rate. The vote will request the $USD amount in GTC at the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average.\n\nFull details:\nThe full budget and conversation can be found on the governance forums:\nIntegrated: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-proposal-integrated-gitcoin-allo-budget-request/12920\nDraft: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-proposal-draft-gitcoin-allo-budget-request/12739\n\n",

A particular shout out to @Maxwell for all his help shaping this budget.  Essential Intents During S17, we will continue to prioritize the following EIs  EI1: Protocol Adoption EI2: Financial Sustainability EI3: DAO Organization EI4: Grants Program Success   TL;DR Our S16 goals were:  Launch Gitcoin Protocol Alpha Round Successfully Transition 90% of selected & willing grantees successfully for Alpha round to the protocol Transition Partners successfully to the protocol Determine future of the program + services strategy + structure Plan Partner + community retreat in support of protocol launch  PGF has remained on track to hit these goals. The two caveats are that (1) we\u2019re still aligning on details of the services strategy and communicating that more clearly to the broader community (2) we haven\u2019t fully scheduled and transitioned partners to the protocol. That said, we are in conversation with partners about scheduling rounds from March onward after we launch the beta of Allo Protocol and start testing a fee for service model. We are also in discussions about running featured rounds in April when we launch the next iteration of the Gitcoin Program during our Beta period.  We\u2019d also like to celebrate behind the scenes work that exceeded our goals. We launched the UNICEF Innovation round in Q4 2022 that raised over 130 ETH (50 ETH from UNICEF Innovation and 80 ETH from 15,500 Donors)!!  In addition, a less tangible highlight is how the PGF team has become a tight and highly efficient unit. It wasn\u2019t easy to reorg the team but we\u2019re down a total of 50% of contributors over the past 3 seasons to 9 FT and 2 PT contributors and one contributor on leave (@annika we\u2019re excited to have you back soon). We\u2019re building a strong culture of talented, highly effective, and dedicated contributors. Our main goals for S17 are twofold: Protocol growth readiness and Gitcoin Grants Program readiness. Our overarching priority in S17 is to continue setting up the protocol for successful adoption with solid infrastructure to drive sustainable growth. Overall we will  Developing runbooks and guides for communities to use to run QF rounds and drive adoption Running test rounds with partners to onboard and enable them to manage their own programs permissionlessly Defining and launching the Core Gitcoin Grants Program in April, to embrace our DAO\u2019s goal of funding public goods with our protocol Defining and providing a paid services offering to early adopters until a fully self serve approach is viable   Amount PGF\u2019s total request will be $606,000 USD for S17. A 30% decrease from last season. Accounting for 60+ day reserves and current reserves we are requesting $337,903 USD for S17. A 68% decrease from last season. 1) The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower. 2) The Treasury Request amount is an estimate using the price of $2.10 GTC to calculate the total of the reserves rolled over from Season 16.

First, really appreciate that this team has spent time and energy restructuring this team. I also love seeing this team embracing a test and learn mentality that will allow us to swiftly identify what works/what doesn\u2019t and move forward. I\u2019m also happy to see a partner prioritization strategy planned as I think this will enhance efficiency/effectiveness. I see how the vision for getting program managers/groups on the protocol by bringing them in to the Festival but I\u2019d love to better understand if we anticipate everyone who uses the Stack to therefore initially be a Festival participant or if we will be allowing/enabling autonomous rounds to run this season (totally get it if not, just curious for those asking if they can just spin up their own round now). I see a lot of KPIs tied to number of partners and their relative size, which makes sense given our main audience focus being program managers at this time. Last of my questions was pertaining to the Community Gathering - is this more of a sales play or a reward for a job well done? A thank you? Would love to understand the size of the partner commits we envision coming out of this, and if there are any other KPIs related to donors/grantees that could be tied to this (not sure how just saying) I\u2019d love to see them. I\u2019d also love to better understand where this cost falls within this budget. In future seasons, I\u2019d love to better understand how this relates to the grantees (and thereby donors) attracted/onboarded/converted/retained. Ultimately, and this is not just related to this budget but more broadly speaking, I\u2019d love for us to tie audience-level insights and goals to product-level goals to the broader DAO level goals as they relate to specific metrics we collectively define. Overall - and like I said, I still feel new to this process - looking at the budgets by workstream feels fragmented to me and I\u2019d love to better understand how we look at the larger DAO wide budget first to then inform the workstream ones. If there\u2019s something I can reference like this, appreciate someone sharing. ",

                    "content": " Allo Protocol S17 Workstream Budget Proposal During Season 17, the GPC workstream (Gitcoin Product Collective) has decided to split into two workstreams: Gitcoin Allo which is focused on the continued development of our Grants protocol and stack, and Gitcoin Passport which is focused on our Passport protocol and stack. Splitting GPC into two workstreams will allow for a more \u201ccomplete\u201d team structure in the future.  This will allow for a more \u201ccomplete\u201d team structure in the future. @nategosselin and @kevin.olsen will be workstream leads for this workstream (h/t to @kyle for his assistance getting this initial draft up and running).  Essential Intents We are focused on a number of the Essential Intents. Specifically the following two:  Protocol Adoption + Growth Financial Sustainability   TL;DR This season the Allo workstream will be focused on transitioning from alpha to beta, with Eth Denver as a key milestone and inflection point. At a high level, we will be focused on three key themes:   Finish Protocol v0 \u2014 finalize the payouts interface and build our first payout mechanism so that there is an end-to-end protocol flow  Engage the developer community \u2014 with the foundational protocol complete, we will ramp up our DevRel efforts and work on getting external teams building on Allo  Productize QF on Grants Stack \u2014 Enabling communities to run Quadratic Funding rounds is a major opportunity for protocol adoption and growth. We want to make running QF rounds to be truly self-serve for non-technical operators on Grants Strack. We received great feedback during our alpha rounds and will continue building solutions to that feedback this season.  Based on what we learned in Season 16, we recognize the need to continue being nimble with our development roadmap so that we can quickly adapt to the needs of the market. This season\u2019s roadmap will likely change month-to-month as we get feedback, so our objectives read more as high-priority user needs than concrete features.  For more context regarding our vision, the current state of the workstream and more please refer to the Workstream Notion Page. This page has not been updated to reflect the new workstream structure at time of writing, but you can find details on our vision and what we are building towards.   Amount Gitcoin Allo (GA) is requesting $803,533 for S17. A breakdown of the budget can be found at the end.     Gitcoin Season Season 15 Season 16 Season 17     Season Budget $\u2013 $\u2013 $803,533    1) The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.  Objectives and Key Results  Milestone Report for the past Season Legend  Success / completed / shipped  Incomplete but will hit goal and/or priority changed for initial description  Incomplete, will not hit goal (see description for reasons why)  Canceled (see description for reasons why)     Initiative/Project Always-on Key Results      Round Operators can run a Quadratic Funding round on the protocol NO   Ran 5 Alpha rounds (UNICEF, Fantom, 3 Gitcoin Alphas) + 2 simulated quadratic funding rounds   Round Operator can run a Quadratic Voting round on the protocol NO   The team did significant scoping and discovery but, in consultation with other workstreams, ultimately decided to deprioritize QV in favor of remaining focused on QF, Alpha round support, and payouts work   Round Operator can execute payouts on the protocol NO   The team originally planned to have this completed by Eth Denver, despite including it as a milestone on our S16 budget. We are still on track to build this by the launch in Denver.   Donors can browse and assess the projects in a round NO   All alpha rounds mentioned above used the Explorer front end designed for this experience. The Gitcoin Alpha rounds also included a first integration with Passport for Sybil Defense.   Project Reputation NO   Our workstream had multiple S16 milestones that were effectively the same problem: enabling project reputation. The Grants Hub team spent significant time exploring the problem area of users bringing project reputation to other protocols, but ultimately learned that this was not an immediate need. Given these learnings, we\u2019ve refocused on an Allo-specific funding use case for project reputation and will be working on that area in S17.     Objectives and Key Results As mentioned above, we are tracking three key themes for Season 17. Given the need to be nimble, we will primarily use a monthly roadmap for how we translate those themes into development work. In February we are focusing on three high-priority needs for launch (payouts, repo refactor, and application flow improvements). We will share an updated Season 17 roadmap in the coming weeks and update it on a monthly cadence as our plans crystallize. Note: at this stage of development we have yet to establish baseline metrics for our products. We plan to establish our core metric portfolio and begin measuring baselines this season. Our goal is to transition to metrics-lead objectives in future seasons. For now, we have left metrics blank and instead focused on likely focus areas.  List of S17 OKRs     Initiative/Project Layer Metrics Likely Efforts      Finish Protocol v0Complete the payouts interface so that end-to-end funding programs can run on Allo Protocol. Protocol - - Finalize payouts interface - Build bulk payout mechanism    Engage the developer communityRamp up our DevRel efforts to begin getting developers building on the protocol. Protocol - - Refactor repos into easy-to-use Allo repo- Improve Documentation, Legibility, DX - Partnership and Project Incubation (likely focused on allocation mechanisms + payouts)    Productize QF on Grants StackEnabling communities to run QF rounds is a major adoption and growth opportunity for our products. We want to remain laser-focused on the feedback we heard during the Alpha rounds and build a first-class QF grants exerpeince. Stack + Protocol - - General iteration on Alpha round feedback- Improve Application experience for Operators + Grantees - Improve project review flow for Operators- Improve and enrich the explorer experience for donors- Enable new verified credentials so that projects can accrue reputation (including KYC)     Budget Breakdown We have broken the budget down by staffing, contracting, devrel, opex as we feel like this gives fairly granular details into where the funding will be going.

The Allo budget carries over the GPC Reserves which are in excess of the standard 60 day request, you\u2019ll see the total S17 request is less than the total budgeted spend as a result.     griff:  That said I\u2019m, in general, supportive of this proposal, but I want to ask every workstream\u2026 what would happen if this proposal didn\u2019t pass?   I just responded on the Passport budget, but somewhat similar outlook here on the Allo side. In the scenario where Passport is funded, and Allo is not, Allo would have 80% of the season funded from reserves. The choice would be to reduce spending by 20% to survive until S18 and put up another budget or spin down the workstream. It would be essential to receive direction from the Stewards and the rest of the DAO regarding the preferred path. As in my hypothetical that I explored in my response on the passport budget: if neither budget passes, we would be required to spin down the work pretty quickly. The DAO would need to help produce a contingency plan for this, either sourcing a small team for maintenance and operations, rebuilding a team for in-house development, or finding a new home for the products outside the DAO. Thanks for exploring the tougher topics here, and I hope that helps. ",

In our original S17 budget request (this request) we cited having $645,628 in reserves. When the S17 budget request went to snapshot we cited having $1,049,168 in reserves. As mentioned in our snapshot summary, the extra reserves are due to price increases from when the S16 budget was issued, absorbing the Moonshot Collective treasury, and strong diversification in S16. The main reason we didn\u2019t catch the discrepancy in our actual reserves amount when posting our initial S17 budget request was because a large amount of our reserves were held in the foundation\u2019s coinbase (CB) account at the time. We partner with the foundation to diversify our GTC into USDC to pay contributors primarily in USDC. We realized we forgot to include these funds held on CB when the foundation sent us all of our diversified funds when clearing our trading balance for S16. Another reason we have more reserves than expected is when we requested our S16 budget we assumed that we would have $0 in reserves from S15 due to the falling price of GTC at the time. When our S15 budget was issued we actually had ~$86.5k in USDC and 16k in GTC. Due to an oversight on our end we failed to update our budget request when it went to tally to reflect these reserves. This resulted in our workstream getting slightly overfunded for S16. I apologize for this oversight in calculating our S15 & S16 reserve amounts. ",

                    "content": " [S17 Proposal] INTEGRATED Gitcoin Allo Budget Request NOTE: This request is structurally the same as the draft budget, but with additional detail on our workstream\u2019s remit, strategy, and roadmap for this season. During Season 17, the GPC workstream (Gitcoin Product Collective) has decided to split into two workstreams: Gitcoin Allo (this workstream) and Gitcoin Passport, which is focused on our Passport protocol and stack. Splitting GPC into two workstreams will allow for a more \u201ccomplete\u201d team structure in the future. @nategosselin and @kevin.olsen will be leads for this workstream. It\u2019s worth taking a moment to clarify exactly what this workstream\u2019s remit will be. As outlined on our workstream page, our responsibility is building the Grants Stack suite of dApps and incubating the initial development of Allo Protocol. Why the distinction? The long-term vision for Allo Protocol is that it stabilizes and progressively decentralizes from workstream \u201cownership\u201d to true DAO/community ownership. This team is responsible for shipping this first iteration, but we will work with the rest of the DAO to eventually establish true community governance of the protocol and its code. Over time, we expect this workstream will function more as a product development team for Grants Stack* exclusively, while also being prominent contributors to the decentralized Allo Protocol.  *We\u2019ve decided to call ourselves the Allo workstream despite a long-term focus on Grants Stack primarily for expediency reasons: it\u2019s a shorter name.   Essential Intents We are focused on a number of the Essential Intents. Specifically the following two:  Protocol Adoption + Growth Financial Sustainability   TL;DR This season the Allo workstream will be focused on transitioning from alpha to beta, with Eth Denver / the April Gitcoin rounds as key milestones and inflection points. Our team is focusing on work for both Allo Protocol and Grants Stack, each with associated S17 outcomes: Allo Protocol: The tl;dr for Allo this season is finishing Protocol v0 and beginning to get builders working with the codebase. Our two Allo-focused outcomes are:   Enable Payouts \u2014 finalize the payouts interface and build our first payout mechanism so that there is an end-to-end protocol flow  Engage the developer community \u2014 with the foundational protocol complete, we will ramp up our DevRel efforts and work on getting external teams building on Allo  Grants Stack: The primary goal in S17 is productizing QF rounds on Grants Stack. We received great feedback during our alpha period and want to focus on addressing so both our Grants Program and self-serve customers can run successful QF rounds. Our outcomes are:   Improve the project application and review flow - a major pain point for program managers is the time spent reviewing and managing applications. This outcome will focus on easing that process and providing some high-demand features from the applicant side.  Build a project reputation system \u2014 another angle for improving the review process is enabling projects to build verified reputation so that programs can more easily vet applications. This season will focus on building out our MVP of this experience.  Provide an easy, intuitive QF round experience \u2014 we want the \u201cQF package\u201d on Grants Stack to be simple from end-to-end, with an easy \u201cHello World\u201d setting for programs new to QF and enough tooling that sophisticated users like our Grants Program can tune the system. This outcome will focus on making that a reality.  Based on what we learned in Season 16, we recognize the need to continue being nimble with our development roadmap so that we can quickly adapt to the needs of the market. This season\u2019s roadmap will likely change month-to-month as we get feedback, so our outcomes are focused on key aspects of the platform that will receive the bulk of our iteration cycles. You can check the roadmap section of our Notion page if you ever want to see what we\u2019re up to at a given moment.  Amount Gitcoin Allo (GA) is requesting $803,533 for S17. We will also send some of the treasury to the Gitcoin Passport Workstream (assuming it\u2019s funded) to help split our reserves. A breakdown of the budget can be found at the end.     Gitcoin Season Season 15 Season 16 Season 17     Season Budget $\u2013 $\u2013 $803,533    1) The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.  Objectives and Key Results  Milestone Report for the past Season Legend  Success / completed / shipped  Incomplete but will hit goal and/or priority changed for initial description  Incomplete, will not hit goal (see description for reasons why)  Canceled (see description for reasons why)     Initiative/Project Always-on Key Results      Round Operators can run a Quadratic Funding round on the protocol NO   Ran 5 Alpha rounds (UNICEF, Fantom, 3 Gitcoin Alphas) + 2 simulated quadratic funding rounds   Round Operator can run a Quadratic Voting round on the protocol NO   The team did significant scoping and discovery but, in consultation with other workstreams, ultimately decided to deprioritize QV in favor of remaining focused on QF, Alpha round support, and payouts work   Round Operator can execute payouts on the protocol NO   The team originally planned to have this completed by Eth Denver, despite including it as a milestone on our S16 budget. We are still on track to build this by the launch in Denver.   Donors can browse and assess the projects in a round NO   All alpha rounds mentioned above used the Explorer front end designed for this experience. The Gitcoin Alpha rounds also included a first integration with Passport for Sybil Defense.   Project Reputation NO   Our workstream had multiple S16 milestones that were effectively the same problem: enabling project reputation. The Grants Hub team spent significant time exploring the problem area of users bringing project reputation to other protocols, but ultimately learned that this was not an immediate need. Given these learnings, we\u2019ve refocused on an Allo-specific funding use case for project reputation and will be working on that area in S17.     Objectives and Key Results As mentioned above, we will primarily use a monthly roadmap for how we translate our themes into development work. In February we are focusing on three high-priority needs for launch (payouts, repo refactor, and application flow improvements). We will share an updated Season 17 roadmap in the coming weeks and update it on a monthly cadence as our plans crystallize. Note: at this stage of development we have yet to establish baseline metrics for our products. We plan to establish our core metric portfolio and begin measuring baselines this season. Our goal is to transition to metrics-lead objectives in future seasons. For now, we have left metrics blank and instead focused on likely projects.  List of S17 OKRs     Layer Initiative/Project Metrics Likely Efforts     Allo Protocol Enable Payouts - - Finalize payouts interface - Build bulk payout mechanism   Allo Protocol Engage the developer community - - Refactor repos into easy-to-use Allo repo- Improve Documentation, Legibility, DX - Partnership and Project Incubation (likely focused on allocation mechanisms + payouts)   Grants Stack Improve the project application and review flow - - Improve Application experience for Operators + Grantees - Improve project review flow for Operators    Grants Stack Build project reputation system - - Enable new verified credentials so that projects can accrue reputation (including KYC)   Grants Stack Provide an easy, intuitive QF round experience - - Improve and enrich the explorer experience for donors - \u201cHello World\u201d QF -Improvements for Grants Program operational management- General iteration on Alpha round feedback      Budget Breakdown We have broken the budget down by staffing, contracting, devrel, opex as we feel like this gives fairly granular details into where the funding will be going.

                    "content": " Gitcoin Passport S17 Workstream Budget Proposal edited Feb 14 Given February is halfway done, we reduced some of the DevRel budget and trued up to what we expect to actually spend in Feb. This reduced our total budget by just a bit.  During Season 17, the GPC workstream (Gitcoin Product Collective) has decided to split into two workstreams: Gitcoin Allo which is focused on the continued development of our Grants protocol and stack, and Gitcoin Passport which is focused on our Passport protocol and stack. Splitting GPC into two workstreams will allow for a more \u201ccomplete\u201d team structure in the future. @kyle and @kevin.olsen will be workstream leads for this workstream. Now that the protocols are both live, we feel we should construct each of the workstream teams to focus accordingly. In time, these two teams will run independent of each other. For S17, there will continue to be tight collaboration. Gitcoin Passport is a billion dollar opportunity to create a truly sybil resistant web experience. We are increasingly of the opinion no one sybil solution will be enough, but we certainly have an opportunity to curb the vast majority of sybil attacks with Gitcoin Passport.  Essential Intents We are focused on a couple of the Essential Intents. Specifically the following two:  Protocol Adoption + Growth Financial Sustainability  A case can probably be made that we are also focused on growing the Grants program as we will support Sybil prevention, but that is a secondary goal on our long arc roadmap.  TL;DR This season the Passport workstream is going to focus on the following outcomes:  Continue to grow the number of Passport holders, and the number of communities integrating with passport Introduce and test at least one new scoring mechanism for other communities to consume Create a first class developer experience for those integrating with passport (either in app or scoring), and drive the number of integrations up to 25  Based on what we learned in Season 16, we will continue to refine infrastructure, strengthen partnerships and take a more thoughtful approach to roadmap planning and feature development. We were just crushed by instability in upstream service providers and so we are making some infrastructure changes to prevent this from happening in the future. We are also going to ensure that we give users the ability to record their passport details on-chain, which will further help reduce the load on key components of our infrastructure. We have had changes in our team composition in S16; we lost two team members (and had another go out on parental leave). As a result we will focus on building context and team cohesion while rallying around our two sided protocol (one side for passport holders and one side for those who seek to access passports).  For more context regarding our vision & the current state of the workstream, please refer to the Notion page for Passport.   Amount Gitcoin Passport (GP) is requesting 281,538GTC = $492,691 for S17. We will be leaving all reserves with the Gitcoin Allo workstream, and as a result we are requesting the full amount of reserves be funded (full 60 days @ ~190k GTC). This means however that the Allo workstream should be requesting less GTC as they will have a relatively large reserve. A full breakdown of the budget can be found at the end of this post.     Gitcoin Season Season 15 Season 16 Season 17     Season Budget $N/A $N/A $492,691    The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.  Milestone Report for the past Season Legend  Success / completed / shipped  Incomplete but will hit goal and/or priority changed for initial description  Incomplete, will not hit goal (see description for reasons why)  Canceled (see description for reasons why)     Initiative/Project Always-on Key Results Value Delivered     Gitcoin Grants protocol is able to use Passport to programmatically identify donors as unique humans NO   Passport used in Alpha Rounds Analysis is needed to confirm the expected result (low fraud tax)   Passport has a productized set of scoring methods that meet the use cases of the majority of interested of communities NO   Multiple scoring mechanisms developed with FDD Scoring for alpha rounds, and scorer API   Passport and its components are verifiable on-chain so any dApp can integrate passport, verify, and trust the source of passports data/components NO   the scoring API is live, passports on not on-chain (outside ceramic) This has enabled programatic integration of our scoring service   Passport holders are able to easily navigate their passports to understand how it could be used across different communities (Research and Design output) NO   We have had turn over on the Product Marketing and Product Management roles for Passport, this has slowed down our ability to make progress here This will make advocates of Passport holders     Objectives and Key Results S17 is going to bring a renewed focus on our product practice to ensure we are intentional in the items we are scoping and building. What this means is, we are going to try and get ahead of the feature development we would like to complete, scope those features on Github, and ensure they are appropriately described such that we can bounty some of that scope if we want to. Essentially, this is the first season where we want to build muscle around inviting outside contributors to help us build functionality that we see as valuable. You can expect us to deliver on the following next season:  Improving the passport holder\u2019s user experience by bolstering the education in app and streamlining workflows for stamp verification. (Milestone: Passport Holder User Experience)  On chain passport data / scores. We have found developers want to access this data on chain, and not just through Ceramic. (Milestone: On-chain scoring)  Continued infrastructure scaling to ensure we can handle the load of Gitcoin Grants Rounds  (Milestone: Scoring API Minimum Viable Product)   We are eager to strengthen our partnership with DevRel and Product Marketing to relaunch Gitcoin Passport in February of this year (updated docs, updated marketing, more education, new website, etc.)  You can see some of the progress on the marketing front here (Huge thanks to MMM for leading this work!)  Though we are not defining this as a cmomitted objective, we will also be spending time expanding our GTC Staking use case, and improve that experience. We are seeing adoption of this utility and passport holders are using this as a means to increase their humanity score (for the Gitcoin Alpha Rounds). In time, we want to build out slashing capabilities to create a Sybil hunting microeconomy, thereby rewarding those helping us find and remove sybil actors.  List of S17 Goals     Initiative/Project Always-on Metrics Expected Impact      Protocol Adoption GrowthImprove Passport Holder\u2019s User Experience No * Increase the number of average stamps a passport holders holds by 10% * Reduce the time it takes to verify stamps by 25% - Improved usability (especially on mobile)- Improved sentiment of Passport      Protocol Adoption GrowthImprove integratooooors experience No * Increase the number of devs integrating with Passport * Improved sentiment of our documentation and developer experience - Reduction in time required to integrate- More creative and expansive use cases surfaced      Protocol Adoption GrowthDevelop a second scoring mechanism for integrators to select from No * Multiple scoring methods are used in App - Diversified use cases for Passport     Budget Breakdown We have broken the budget down by staffing, contracting, devrel, and opex as we feel like this gives fairly granular details into where the funding will be going. This does not currently show the cost for each initiative, but we hope to do this next season with the milestone based bounty work we may be doing. We kept some budget for hackathons / contractor\u2019s work on scoring mechanisms, and also called out Dev Rel uniquely as we expect this to be an expense that grows for the DAO in the future. Finally, this budget grows slightly over the past season as we added another developer to bring the team to four FT devs (with a fifth on paternal leave right now). Once our developer who is on paternal leave returns, our extra engineer will move back to the Allo workstream. We are thankful for the coverage during the paternal leave. Our New Multisig for funding the workstream is: 0x19E50fA5623895D5a2976693eaFF5C2F879510ed | the signers for this are: Kyle (kbw), Kevin Olsen, Michael, Janine, Annika)  View: USD per Category     Gitcoin Passport in USD  Feb Mar Apr Total     Staffing         Passport Core Contributors 96,751 96,751 96,751 290,254    Passport Leadership / Ops 26,146 26,146 26,146 78,438    Severance 0 0 0 0   Total Staffing  122,897 122,897 122,897 368,691   Contracting         DevOps 3,000 3,000 3,000 9,000   Total Contracting  3,000 3,000 3,000 9,000   DevRel         Devl Rel 15,000 20,000 20,000 55,000    Hackathons & Bounties 5,000 5,000 5,000 15,000   Total DevRel  20,000 25,000 25,000 70,000   OpEx         Saas Fees (AWS, Datadog, fleek, etc.) 15,000 15,000 15,000 45,000   Total OpEx  15,000 15,000 15,000 45,000           Total GPC Budgeted Spend  160,897 165,897 165,897 $492,691   60 Day Reserves     $328,428   S16 Treasury Balance     0   Total S17 Request     $821,119    Thanks for the consideration.

Currently no, this work has lived in FDD, and the post round analysis is still up in the air where it will live in the new structures. I can see the benefit to having this happen here, or closer to the round operations work. Either way the post round analysis should be feeding back to product to ensure we enable the scaling of this work via software product development.     griff:  I am not excited about such a huge spend on passport this quarter, would prefer a slower ramp up of the reserves.   This is the standard 60 reserve request, because this is a new workstream Passport has no reserves and is requesting the full amount (Allo has maintained the reserves from the former GPC and you\u2019ll see that reflected in the Allo budget request)     griff:  That said I\u2019m, in general, supportive of this proposal, but I want to ask every workstream\u2026 what would happen if this proposal didn\u2019t pass?   Totally get it, and I posed the same thought experiment to FDD on their budget. For Passport, given there are no reserves, it would stop this workstream before it started \u2014 basically a no vote on splitting GPC and a no vote on thin workstreams. We haven\u2019t received any pushback from stewards on this split, so it\u2019s not a scenario we\u2019re seriously planning for. In the hypothetical where both budgets fail, we have less than 2 months\u2019 runway (having brought on the devrel expenses from PGF), and it would be a best effort to meet obligations as we close up shop. I imagine most contributors would be quite distracted lining up their next jobs, and we would expect very low output and high attrition. That would also leave Passport without operations or maintenance. The DAO would need to decide what to do with the Passport product, either shutting it down, finding and staffing a new team, or finding a 3rd party team that would want to take over the development and operations of Passport. In the hypothetical scenario where the Allo budget passed, we could try to pull the workstreams back together. The Allo budget + Reserves could just cover both workstreams operations for the season. But would completely deplete GPC workstream reserves, leaving the re-unified workstream in a precarious position. ",

We look to cut headcount. We don\u2019t have much opportunity on the team to do this, but we can evaluate those actions if needed. As an FYI, the headcount is fixed and is slightly large, but we have a team member on parental leave, so we have and \u201cextra\u201d dev salary right now.

It seems that would be ideal.   I fully agree that as much of this as is possible should live in the product team, but there are two different functions happening here in the post round analysis. I believe one belongs with the product teams (Not only passport) and one belongs with the program. The product goal is to make iterative improvements so the product alone can offer a delightful and trustworthy experience. The program goal is to ensure that the program managers, including our own, are able to assess the issues that come up in a round and use analysis to ensure they get results that will continue their communities trust in the legitimacy and credible neutrality of the round. Here are a few things that might surprise people. I think the passports system of reputation attestation, gating, and a shared ETL layer for transparent algorithmic policy decisions which is needed for Projects and for Programs as well as identity. We\u2019ve discussed this need for Projects in FDD as far back as Season 13. Recently, I\u2019ve been hearing \u201cProject Reputation that works like Passport\u201d from the product team. I an HIGHLY certain we will need the same thing for Programs within a year. Two years max. However, when you ask the product team to solve a problem specific to each individual round, it crosses a known problem in working styles. Zargham is great at comparing the pace of work to its technical difficulty. The product teams don\u2019t work at the pace the program managers need to keep the trust of their community. That is what FDD has been doing this whole time. I suggest that a Fraud Analyst who is focused on the program managers gaining trust from their communities using our product should take a holistic view of the issues. They will look at GRANT FRAUD in addition to identity fraud. They will look at signals that combine the two. They will make recommendations to Product Managers to mitigate the current inadequacies of the products AND work with the product teams to retrospectively understand the issues which needed data analysis to mitigate.     kevin.olsen:  I like this suggestion a lot and see Passport similarly. I have seen a lot of conversations where Passport is mischaracterized as only the front-end prevention. In truth, it relies on the continuous observations and improvements offered by the back-end analysis, and bringing those together into a single workstream feels like a natural fit to me as well.   For the reasons above, I disagree with this. But I think I figured out why we aren\u2019t communicating this well. It is matrix of issues which confuses the situation. Yes, Passport relies on backend analysis to close the loop. Let\u2019s look at a happy path where Passport does in fact close the loop\u2026 Should the Allo protocol be opinionated that preventative sybil defense is the only acceptable option? Should retroactive sybil discounting be applied using only the Passport stamps as signals? Retroactive sybil discounting (squelching) requires other on-chain signals which may or may not be consented to, but are public data. This is because the other non-consented pieces of information are where we find the data delta between legitimate behaviors and illegitimate ones. Depending on how you answer these, we could place both Jobs To Be Done into Passport product: Preventative Gating of Sybils & Retroactive Sybil Discounting (Squelching) However, these are two distinct JTBD that should both be OPTIONS from an unopinionated primative or protocol. And each has its own loop to close. But neither addresses the work that moves at the speed of real-time mitigation. Without this, the Program Managers lose the TRUST of their communities. These communities then lose trust in GITCOIN. Communities want to be paid out ASAP after rounds. We usually take 3-4 weeks. Product teams shouldn\u2019t be trying to work at the pace of prioritized product development AND putting the fires out for specific rounds with real time analysis. Check out the specific section in this article called \u201cClustering Workstream Modes & Frequencies in Decentralized Communities: The Socio-Technical Frequency Map\u201d for more on the pacing issue. This is why I\u2019m advocating for Passport to hire a Data Analyst/Scientist who works closely with a Data Analyst on the Allo team and a Fraud Analyst on the PGF Growth/Program team. I\u2019m willing to learn that I am wrong on this point. Strong opinion, held loosely. But I will take the bet that program reputation is a thing at this time next year! ",

I would expect our DevRel budget to drop at that time, and Allo to increase quite a bit to accommodate a similar build out. It is highly likely we will not use all of the DevRel budget we are requesting, but we wanted to leave a bit of room for opportunistic collaborations.

Currently the core Passport team is 5 engineers (one is out on parental leave), 1 PM, and 1 Designer. Leadership/Ops is a team of 3.     GClayMiller:  Are the 60 day reserves just 2 months of additional runway in case unexpected costs arise? Are they returned to the treasury if unspent or rollover to the next season?   Correct, unspent reserves roll over to the next season, and the following season we will only request the funds from treasury needed (i.e. expected operations + 60 day reserves - current reserves) Thanks for your interest, hope that helps you evaluate your support for the budget!

Amount: Gitcoin Passport (GP) workstream is requesting 404,750GTC* for S17. We will be leaving all reserves with the Gitcoin Allo workstream, and as a result we are requesting the full amount of reserves be funded. *The GTC total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally. In this post, we used a $1.98 conversion rate. The vote will request the $USD amount in GTC at the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average.
