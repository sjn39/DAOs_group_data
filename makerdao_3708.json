Specification  Motivation I, Amy Jung, the Facilitator of Operational Support, am offboarding effective May 31, 2021 on entirely good terms. Operational Support was mandated as a domain using the former structure of MIP23. Operational Support will no longer exist as a domain nor a team in the MIP39: Core Unit Framework. Most of the mandate of this team has merged with Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit: SES-001. This subproposal is largely a formality to confirm the decision and officially remove the authority and permissions I continue to hold as an Operational Support Facilitator.  Core Unit ID  Operational Support was mandated as a domain using the former MIP23 structure and as mentioned, it is not being proposed as Core Unit. There is no Core Unit ID.  ",
