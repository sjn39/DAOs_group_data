I\u2019d like to emphasize here that we at EasySwap believe that UNI tokens are not just a way to make easy money but more important than that it\u2019s a way for us, product/content creator to actively participate on the governance of this Exchange. That said, I\u2019d like to request your attention to the fact that most of the now reputable products had to fight for their space on Uniswap and due to the storm of scams that was and is still hurting users portfolios, the tool we found to protect the Uniswap users was to send the liquidity tokens to a VAULT CONTRACT that eliminates the changes of RUG PULLS. We understand that this was a major step taken by many of us, product providers, and it became the new standard of security for Uniswap trading. Almost nobody buys a coin that is not sent to a VAULT. Of course we didn\u2019t know of the airdrop and what were the conditions to be entitled to these coins and it looks like the airdrop was not given to the accounts Here it is the address of the VAULT contract that holds our liquidity tokens.    Ethereum (ETH) Blockchain Explorer    Contract Address 0x376b512ccd0704ccc4153870918c6dca2c0ee1c5 | Etherscan The Contract Address 0x376b512ccd0704ccc4153870918c6dca2c0ee1c5 page allows users to view the source code, transactions, balances, and analytics for the contract address.

It is 100% possible to have a secure and decentralized listing process. Not only that, there are plenty of other ways to counteract the problem. Do you realize your simply dismissing a team that fundamentally made Uniswap a better platform? So arrogant. Who are you to tell experts in a field essentially \u201csorry, best of luck\u201d without having even the most fundamental concept of decentralization! We already have lists, you could add rankings and clout, implement plenty of trust metrics to listings based on the Liquidity, change in volume, age, etc. to let people know how reputable a listing is. As long as it runs on a decentralized network, and a community comes to a consensus on it, it is decentralized. ",
