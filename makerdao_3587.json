                    "content": "Hi everyone. The key objective of the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit (SES) is to ensure the sustainability of MakerDAO and the Maker Protocol while we scale the ecosystem, avoiding critical failure of the project. Therefore SES is putting together a registry of risks and opportunities for MakerDAO. This registry will be a tool that helps identify and prioritize projects that MakerDAO could work on.  |624.64x351.0040246653235960\u00d7540 16.7 KB  Fig 1: Relationship between Risks, Opportunities and Projects Risks Identifying the risks (operational, technical, legal, \u2026) that MakerDAO faces is important to ensure the robustness of the project as it scales. It can help the community to sufficiently mitigate or avoid issues before they materialize. We will rank and prioritize risks by scoring them based on their severity and likelihood. An example of a risk could be \u201cUSDC blacklists the Maker Protocol, leading to a loss of collateral in the system\u201d. Opportunities Identifying and listing the opportunities of MakerDAO is important to ensure the continued growth and upscaling of the project. We will rank and prioritize opportunities based on their potential growth impact and likelihood of success. This will help guide MakerDAO in prioritizing which opportunities it should pursue. An example opportunity could be \u201cIncrease Dai adoption in Europe through a Euro-pegged stablecoin\u201d. Projects A project is a body of work that either addresses identified risks, pursues high impact opportunities, or a combination of both. Identified risks and opportunities therefore feed into potential projects for MakerDAO, and they help determine the priority of the project. Projects can vary in size from a single task, to a project spanning months, or even enough work for a permanent core unit. In order to get a full picture of the risk and opportunities we recognize the need for broad input from the community. Therefore, as a starting point, we are reaching out here on the forums to gather initial input from all of you to crowdsource entries to the initial registry of risks and opportunities. Our request to you:  List the top risks that are currently on your mind (for example top 3) List the top opportunities that are currently on your mind (for example top 3)  If you have any projects in mind that would mitigate those risks, or act on those opportunities, feel free to add those as well. We will then take the suggestions from this thread, combine them with our own list, and publish the risks, opportunities and potential projects with a lot more information. This will then also clarify the scoring, how the list will be maintained going forward, and how we will continue to collect feedback in the future. Thanks in advance for your input  ",

Risks:   DAI does not scale quickly enough to survive an official digital dollar. We\u2019re in third place in a race that can probably only hold one competitor to actual dollars, should the US government choose to pursue a digital currency that is compatible with blockchain.   Lack of internal oversight. The diffusion of responsibility (thanks to @LongForWisdom for remembering the term) in the DAO means there\u2019s no party on any given proposal who is guaranteed to weigh in on proposals \u2013 budgetary or otherwise. The lack of discussion on some upcoming proposals before being pushed into on-chain voting \u2013 regardless of your position on them \u2013 should worry anyone here.   Lack of plans of succession or replacement of key figures. I know we\u2019re a young organization, but if some key figure in the DAO retires, is incapacitated, or even ghosts on us (maybe they died in a car wreck or something but we don\u2019t know how to contact them directly), we\u2019re in for a world of trouble. We need our CUs and key community member participation activities to be robust to that. What happens if @SebVentures or @LongForWisdom or @hexonaut or one of many other DAO members fall down the stairs tomorrow? We need a way to ensure continuity of operations in all the areas that are absolutely mission critical.   I added a fourth because I believe it to be important, though less urgent. There\u2019s a fairly wide divide between the arm of the DAO that wants profits and the arm of the DAO that wants to more philosophically upend the way finance is done. Both have a stake in growing and securing DAI, so it\u2019s not an issue at the moment. But I think we really need to discuss more openly what our priorities as an organization are. Is DAI a business that does good in the world while making us profits? Or are we willing to forgo profits to maintain a certain philosophical purity? Neither is the wrong answer, but I think the two different sets of expectations will have a collision whenever the course forward on both is no longer parallel.   Opportunities:   Scale even more quickly by straddling the real-world-crypto divide. We already do this with the RWA CU. But given that we back DAI with a promise of at least $1 of assets, there is a lot of room for us to push out DAI as fast as the peg will let us. Instead of waiting for assets to come to us and then mint DAI, we can mint DAI and then buy/hold the assets that are worth (or are) at least $1 in value. We have already begun moving in this direction with the PSM and the Direct Deposit Module. We should continue down this road and be the bridge between real-world financial markets and crypto by effectively bringing dollars into the crypto ecosystem, which is starved for liquidity despite all the protocols that specialize in it. Yields are screaming for more stablecoin, and a bold move in this direction is the only way to surpass Tether and USDC as the reserve currency.   More financial products. The physics of crypto finance operate differently than in traditional finance. Flash loans are a great example. There is a window for us to create more building-block, simple instruments that can be utilized by the various DeFi dashboards and aggregators. Even if we don\u2019t want to build these ourselves, we should still think about what needs aren\u2019t filled yet, and either seed projects interested in those or find a way to collaborate with the retail-facing tier of protocols to provide them. A more robust financial ecosystem will be a more secure one, and thus more secure for DAI.   While it\u2019s not why any of us are here, we are absolutely carrying forward the flag of dollar supremacy in the crypto world. We are as a byproduct doing the job of the Fed, the Treasury, and large financial institutions that benefit from a dollar reserve currency. We desperately need to have regular, standardized communications with some of these entities so we can be treated as partners and not merely affected bystanders by anything they do. The Fed and Treasury in particular can benefit from a closer relationship to us, as a way to both place debt and prevent an unfriendly currency from undercutting a cornerstone of their operations. There are lots of ways to imagine partnership with these entities that both reduces regulatory/legal risk and increases profit potential, all without giving up our independence.   ",

I believe that there\u2019s a warning sign that\u2019s being ignored right now but might come back to haunt us in a few months. In a bull market, DAI supply should easily outstrip demand resulting in a DAI that is below peg. The fact that this is not happening right now has resulted in the PSM filling up with USDC. This is a warning sign that the upcoming bear market will result in one of the following   PSM fills up extremely rapidly with USDC forcing the debt ceiling to rise by orders of magnitude over what it is now or   PSM debt ceiling is hit and DAI goes significantly above peg.   When ETH crashes, DAI demand will go through the roof and vaults will close choking off supply. I have some mitigating actions (however, none are even close to sufficient in my opinion)   We need immediate action to get the USDC out of the PSM. The tout fee should be set to zero. There might be some hope that DAI drops below peg as ETH continues its run and every opportunity to remove USDC from the PSM should be taken.   Set the surplus buffer to a much larger amount e.g. 10% of outstanding DAI. This should be thought of as strategic reserves of DAI, much like the US does with oil. During the bear market, outstanding DAI will decrease and the surplus buffer will then release DAI into the market. This would soften the supply crunch a little bit. The 10% number is just an example but I think the exact number can be worked out with some simulations of ETH price.   ",

Up until this moment, MakerDAO was dealing with crypto-native assets only, market risk was the only core risk to manage (okay, some liquidity risk too). And the level of overcollateralisation and automation through sc execution, keepers, liq 2.0 etc mostly covers those risks. With the move into RWA, market risk reduces somewhat but credit risk and operational risks increase significantly. For that we need capital provision to keep the ecosystem healthy, which the SB is supposed to provide. The full consumption of SB for operations, or even 50% of it, is not warranted at all imho. The whole leverage ratios and risk-weighted assets calcs done by RWF are there for a reason. ",

                    "content": "Thanks @lollike for the encouragement to circle back to this impressive thread. Here\u2019s a few things that have been on my mind as of late, a lot of this is informed by thinking of Maker as playing an infinite game, with all the weight of focusing on continuing to play and iterate rather than look for ways to \u201cwin\u201d something that could all be taken away in an instant if we aren\u2019t focused on building a resilient and versatile protocol. Risks  Tightly correlated revenue streams.   Most of the current Core Units are not profit generating, and thus depend on the protocol as a whole generating enough revenue to cover their expenses. This in itself does not constitute a major risk IMO, but makes the resiliency of the core revenue model incredibly important. Our revenue streams are put at significant risk during a de-levering event, or extended bear market. When the broader crypto market crashes or declines continually there are less reasons to open and maintain a vault, meaning that a revenue haircut is likely. As we build and iterate on our current revenue model, there is significant focus on adding more to what\u2019s been done before. This is good and valuable, but does little to address finding non-correlated revenue models.   Reliance on key contributors/mandated actors    @PaperImperium detailed this so I won\u2019t go into it too much further, other than to say particularly on the dev side a Wrench Attack has the potential to do a lot of harm. I believe this is compounded by the liquidity readily available in the space and other competing protocols in particular. I believe our response to this risk must focus not only on decentralization, but on maintaining an attractive work culture within Maker.   Regulatory Action   Part of this compounds with #2, as public figures within the DAO could be targeted by national governments and forcibly removed from the ability to contribute to the DAO. But there are other attack vectors regulators can take that would have high impact, such as focusing on Crypt <> Fiat bridges that make things like getting paid or incentivizing actors with DAI fair less effective. Other regulatory vectors could simply remove participation from the Etherum network, causing a more essential risk to the broader ecosystem. I believe becoming multi-chain helps mitigate some of this risk, but trying to win a game of whack-a-mole with government regulators would surely stifle innovation at Maker.  Opportunities  Growing NFT ecosystem   NFTs, much like cryptocurrencies themselves, have the ability to disrupt just about any traditional domain. We are already seeing NFTs used as proxy collaterals for NFTs as well as the explosion of crypto-native art. Collateralizing NFTs is a hard nut to crack, with limited market pricing information for each asset the pricing risk for issuing any amount of DAI against an NFT is far from trivial, but with that said, NFTs are objectively assets and finding a way to tap into the market will result in great DAI expansion. Additionally, I would like to see Maker pursue NFT issuance. As one of the oldest projects on Ethereum, our brand and history can produce several valuable artifacts that might be of interest to the broader ecosystem. It is my belief that NFTs could be used more broadly for revenue generation, as well as fundraising for projects within the community.   RWA Expansion   I feel this has mostly been said, but worth highlighting as something I believe could take Maker to the next level of global acceptance and use. By diversifying our collateral polls and touching more traditional lending spaces we can envision much more DAI creation as well as a global reputation that extends beyond crypto enthusiasts.   Tooling for decentralized decision making   By experimenting and improving processes we can make our governance process more efficient and allow ideas to be debated and polled in more effective ways. I believe this exploration will be internally useful and pay huge dividends to the DAO in the future, but also see how it can translate more directly to our financial books. As, arguably, one of the more successful examples of decentralized governance around we have incredible institutional knowledge and experience that other projects could find valuable. Things like our experience with SourceCred and other open source platforms could be packaged and monetized. The story of MakerDAO is a real page turner and I believe there are plenty of individuals and organizations that would pay us for consulting and select publications detailing our experience.   Parting Thoughts Many of the largest and most successful tech companies start to pursue different genres of business with their wealth. While Maker still has much to explore and improve in the decentralized finance space, I believe our frame work has already opened the door for using the Maker brand to fuel other related endeavors (think revenue sharing from CUs like the MakerDAO Shop). As a DAO, we are only as strong as the people we attract to contribute and protect the protocol. By expanding the space we are iterating on slowly and intentionally we can greatly scale our impact and find different ways to keep us in the decentralized game. ",
