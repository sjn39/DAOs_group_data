These offboardings were all approved by MKR voters in the most recent ratification polls that ended on 2022-10-24.  SH-001  DAI vesting stream #5 and MKR vesting stream #23 will be yanked. Per the offboarding proposal, 43,332 DAI and 26.04 MKR will be sent to the SH-001 multsig at 0xc657aC882Fb2D6CcF521801da39e910F8519508d. This amount and address has been agreed by @aburban90.  EVENTS-001  DAI vesting stream #4 will be yanked. There is no MKR vesting stream. Per the offboarding proposal, 167,666 DAI will be transferred to the EVENTS-001 multisig at 0x3D274fbAc29C92D2F624483495C0113B44dBE7d2. This amount is calculated by subtracting the 15,018 DAI in the multisig from the 182,674 DAI amount approved by governance. This amount and address has been agreed by @PonJerry.  RWF-001  DAI vesting stream #35 will be yanked. There is no MKR vesting stream. Unlike the other two CUs being offboarded, the RWF-001 budget flow includes an auditor wallet and the offboarding MIP specifies that any payments should be routed through that wallet - 0x96d7b01Cc25B141520C717fa369844d34FF116ec. I have discussed with the auditors from @SES-Core-Unit and the following steps will take place:  0 DAI will be sent from the surplus buffer to the auditor wallet - the auditor wallet has sufficient DAI balance to fund the remaining offboarding costs. Any DAI balance above 176,000 DAI in the auditor wallet will be returned to MakerDAO via DssBlow. 143.46 MKR will be sent to the auditor wallet - this is the approved 201.46 MKR minus the 58 MKR already in the auditor wallet. The auditors will arrange separate MKR payments to @williamr, @Eumenes, and @teej per the amounts listed in the offboarding proposal.   @williamr, @PonJerry, @aburban90 let me know if you have any comments, questions, or concerns about anything stated above.
