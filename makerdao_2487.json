Let\u2019s say, for example, that we needed 200m USDC debt ceiling in the PSM to restore the peg but we didn\u2019t want to have more than 50m USDC debt ceiling. We could then take the 150m excess USDC and start to run our standard FLAP auctions to buy and burn MKR, which would remove all excess USDC risk from the protocol.  Yes- this would create unbacked DAI which would have the exact effect we want in this scenario- lower the DAI price back to the peg.   It would also provide a massive boost to the MKR price, creating more confidence in the system. Now, let\u2019s say that we overshoot and having unbacked Dai quickly results in Dai falling below the peg.   What would happen then?  We would then raise SF but instead of using the excess Dai to run FLAP auctions, we would first retire the unbacked Dai. Essentially, by using the excess USDC to buy and burn MKR when Dai is above the peg, we would simply be borrowing from future SF income to buy and burn MKR in the present, when we most need it since there is essentially no income to support MKR when SF is at zero and Dai is above the peg.

In a situation where DAI scales to the billions, the system could quickly run amuck, where we need to print billions of MKR to cover billions of stablecoins wrapped through the PSM/PSN. The PSM acts like a wrapper (and I think this is a fear of some people: Dai turns into a wrapper) and should help the protocol scale. Every time an individual converts from USDC to DAI using the wrapper, the system-wide vault possesses 1 USDC for every 1 DAI converted. In this instance, the DAI is backed by 1 USDC (in old-terms, think of it as a vault with 0% LR, 0% stability fee, and some % transaction fee) and is not necessary to use our recollateralization resource: MKR. This PSM does transfer the risk of minting DAI from stablecoins from the vault holders to MKR holders. The only instance in which MKR would need to be printed is if USDC\u2019s value dropped below $0/Blacklist, the protocol-wide USDC vault linked to the PSM module. Other than that, I don\u2019t see another instance in which we would need to print MKR. If we were to use the system-wide vault\u2019s USDC to purchase MKR like you said above, you\u2019re assuming parity in liquidity and low-slippage. If the vault were to purchase $150m MKR (conversion from USDC to MKR like you said), this could easily triple MKR price. On paper, our MKR conversion could look like a sweet deal. If we had to sell this MKR (say we begin to unload the PSM), slippage becomes an issue. After selling the $150m MKR, we\u2019re now left with only $130m MKR and we incur a $20m loss. ",

This inflates the Dai supply and as a result devalues Dai.  In fact it is likely worse because there are a bunch of low liquidity and non-essential transactions being taken that waste value and create slippage. Dai holders will likely be very against this idea as it devalues Dai and also opens it up to more risk.  That is good when you want the price to go down, so I see the logic you are using, but I think the cost is far too high to the entire system.  Again, maybe as a last resort if no better options can be found. ",

Therefore, it would not be fair to MKR holders as they are shouldering the losses if ETH price declines but not receiving any direct benefit.  By buying and burning MKR, its similar to giving MKR holders a short term loan that they then have to pay back when the peg is restored, so its a much more equitable arrangement for them but still achieves the same goals.

The reason Dai is priced over $1.00 is because the demand for Dai in the market as a store of value is higher than the demand for minting Dai and backing it with collateral in the system.  Yes, in the short term it reduces demand for Dai and increases supply, but as soon as Dai hits the peg again and MakerDao removes the additional Dai the issue repeats. I am for this idea so long as every time this issue repeats the additional value of the Dai over a dollar is essentially transferred to MKR holders because that will create value for them while also eventually balancing things out over time.  You can\u2019t keep giving someone $.02 forever or you will run out of money\u2026  MakerDao would have to be darn sure that the value was positive though, because if MakerDao started losing value on this cycle it would lead to system failure.

The large view of the situation is that compound (and soon aave and probably others) is susbsidizing borrowing/lending for the ecosystem. Due to the special curve of Dai, some of the value distributed ends up in the hands of Dai holders with the peg moving above 1. This is bad for Maker because the peg is broken but this is also good because it ensure that dai is still relevant while borrowing on Maker is worst than USDC borrowing on compound in terms of collateral requirement, liquidation penalty and rate after subsidy. What you are proposing is to redirect the value from the hands of Dai holders to MKR holders in order to restore the peg. I agree that it does restore the peg in one direction but IMO from a user perspective it makes maker even less competitive as a platform by sucking value into the hands of \u201cshareholders\u201d. The value would be much better used if redirected towards incentivising usage. ",

For this to happen, it would also mean that Dai would have to remain above its $1 peg even though it was backed by only $0.28 (2/7) in collateral, which is extremely unlikely.  But even if this happened and the peg was then restored, we would then slowly start minting MKR to buy back the unbacked Dai as well as using the incoming SF income to burn Dai until the system was back in surplus.   In reality, we would could also set limits on the initial MKR burn so that we would never have more than 10% of Dai supply be unbacked (in your example it is 70% of supply), so that the impact would be much more manageable. If we got to a situation where we could not restore the peg using the full USDC debt ceiling and having 10% unbacked dai, we are already in a severe failure mode and probably we need ES at that point anyway.

If required, generate unbacked DAI to purchase MKR until peg is restored. For part B, this leaves me with three open questions:  Is it possible/simple to generate unbacked DAI in terms of coding smart contracts and can it be implemented through an executive vote? Does generating unbacked DAI break any social contracts of MakerDAO? (more than a broken peg) If an ES is triggered while there is unbacked DAI, is it catastrophic/undesirable?  ",

                    "content": "It would be fairly easy to covert the current FLAP auctions where MKR is bought with Dai to allow MKR to be bought with USDC.  This would minimize changes to the smart contracts.  If an ES is triggered when there is unbacked Dai, each Dai would just claim e.g $0.95 worth of collateral instead of today where it is $1.00 of collateral. But it would be fully transparent to Dai holders, so I dont think catastrophic,  In fact, it would help rapidly restore the peg. Its also not that much different than today where people pay $1.02 for DAI even though they would only get $1.00 of collateral in the case of an ES ",
