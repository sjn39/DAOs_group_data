Main takeaways are listed below, for more details please reference the deck link above. TL;DR  MakerDAO\u2019s ALM practice is constrained by maintaining DAI\u2019s USD peg and has achieved high liquidity ratios, which provide protocol security, but could indicate less than optimal use of funds. Shift focus to balance sheet optimization to increase net interest income, liquidity buffer and reinvest in the platform. Recognition of vault\u2019s backing collateral (i.e. crypto-collateral) as liabilities, similar to deposits at banks, and as un-invested assets held in reserves. This will establish a baseline for the balance sheet optimization. Focus on balance sheet optimization by converting crypto reserves to generate additional yield by launching an ALM investment program and/or new product features (i.e. notice periods) that will allow funding of short-term investments in crypto native platforms or real world assets. Source investment opportunities to generate yield for the PSM vault. In TradFi this would be similar to the investment program for excess deposits in the interbank market and US treasuries, which is the process by ALM gathers detailed portfolio data, develops scenarios, calculates deposits duration and devise investment strategies for yield-generating investments. Establishing an investment program may lead to a 180 million DAI increase in net interest income. Target state asset returns in table below. Leverage some of these identified investments to increase the robustness of MakerDAO\u2019s liquidity buffer.   1  Target NIM and NII are based on 6/8/22 USD yields and allocation assumptions that may change 2  Crypto market values are based on 5/16/22 market prices 3 NII variance forecast could change based on cryptocurrencies market value fluctuations and investment opportunities @SebVentures ",

There are plenty of areas where we meet:  Focusing the ALM scope more on solvency then interest rate risk (liquidity risk staying important in both TradFi and DeFi). Investing in short-term bonds, area which is underway.  One main difference, and previous commentators have noticed, is taking the collateral of customers as \u201cdeposits\u201d while I take it as a pledge only (enforced by smart contract) in mine. I always took the view that customer collateral is out-of-reach and that we don\u2019t do rehypothecation (like Aave) or anything else with the collateral. From the whitepaper:  Vaults are inherently non-custodial: Users interact with Vaults and the Maker Protocol directly, and each user has complete and independent control over their deposited collateral as long the value of that collateral doesn\u2019t fall below the required minimum level  Yet, it is good that studies like that one challenge this assumption. It might or might not be linked in some ways to Maker Ethereum from the Endgame plan. Overall, it\u2019s really a business question, both are possible. On one side, Aave provide a yield on ETH which make them more attractive to borrow stablecoin there (against DAI), on the other side, having the collateral is pure safety is probably a selling argument as well. Up to the community and MKR holders to decide. ",

                    "content": "@One_Pastrami I think the most elegant solution to Asset-Liability Management is Cash Surrender Value. By pegging DAI (i.e. a stablecoin) to an interest-bearing US Dollar (i.e. a stablecoin) on the balance sheet of a mutual life insurance company, you outsource the interest rate risk. Let the multi-trillion dollar insurance companies and actuaries handle that instead of MakerDAO. Meanwhile, all we do is collect a passive income of 3-6%. Since DAI is overcollateralized and insurance companies are fully-reserved and operate at a surplus (since the Civil War), there is no liquidity or solvency risk. Or to put it another way, if the mutual insurance companies need a bailout DAI\u2019s peg is the least of our problems. It is the closes thing to perfect collateral as you can get to collateralize a digital dollar.    Decentralized Option Vaults and Superfluid Collateral Collateral Onboarding       \u201cIt ain\u2019t what you don\u2019t know that gets you into trouble. It\u2019s what you know for sure that just ain\u2019t so.\u201c \u2013 Mark Twain  Between now and 2045, a total of $84.4 trillion in wealth is expected to pass down either to beneficiaries or charity in the United States. What are they expected to do with all the wealth they inherit? One solution could be an annuity. A fixed interest annuity is a contract with a life insurance company that provides a guaranteed lifetime stream of income. It is like the Soci\u2026         SebVentures:  One main difference, and previous commentators have noticed, is taking the collateral of customers as \u201cdeposits\u201d while I take it as a pledge only (enforced by smart contract) in mine.   This is a good topic to bring up here. Traditional banks use the cash surrender value of a policy that is cross-collateralizing a secured bank line of credit as a cash deposit and rehypothecate it 10 times over. Plus they still get the risk-free yield from the loan. I think it makes sense to rehypothecate only the cash surrender value since it\u2019s the most pristine collateral and has no variance in price. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to use crypto for rehypothecation. Also, the contractual policy loan provision gives life insurance contracts a self-liquidation mechanism (i.e. exit liquidity) at all times. MakerDAO can treat the insurance collateral as the senior secured tranche, maybe if there\u2019s a capital raise or revenue-based financing that would make it the mezzanine debt tranche, and the MKR holders the equity tranche. Some corporations even use IULs as an employee retention program which MakerDAO could employ by issuing them to key persons and instantly their life becomes a cash-flowing balance sheet asset for MakerDAO. Furthermore, the growth in principal from recapitalizing interest can be used as off-balance sheet leverage. All overcollateralized and tax-free until death. Death is not a matter of if, but when. So we might as well be maximizing our CAGR while we\u2019re here.

As such one should be very careful trying to get additional yield on this bucket.   I agree! Due to the volatility of crypto market prices, prudent investment options are needed. Also agree that DAI investment program should be prioritized, and seems to be the case as mentioned by Rune in the comments above and the MIP65 Signal Request. In current state the pledged collateral cryptocurrencies are sitting idle in MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet which is in most cases what collateral should do. Step 1 may be to recognize those collaterals in MakerDAO\u2019s accounting balance sheet to have a line of sight of potential investment decisions that can be implemented without impacting DAI\u2019s peg. A possible outcome may be to continue to have ALL of the collateral sitting idle but my assumption is that borrowers might want to earn a yield on their locked assets (specially as USD rates rise), MakerDAO could earn a referral/commission fee, which could incentivize broader uses and partially reduce repayment risks. This could be a win-win solution for borrowers and MakerDAO. ",

Competitive pressure is another risk that this solution could mitigate, as you rightly pointed out AAVE and Compound pay interest on deposited ETH.     AliceinMKRland:  It\u2019s not impossible, but you\u2019re basically saying take aETH and cETH as collateral   Yes thats a way of thinking about it and this would only be if the DAI borrower opted into those investments and accepted the counterparty risks. As mentioned above the allowed ETH collateral investment should only be the portion above the DAI borrowed amount and a small \u201cliquidity\u201d buffer. E.g. 1 ETH = 1,000 DAI, someone borrowed 10,000 DAI and collateralized 20 ETH (20,000 DAI) into a minimum 150% collateral ratio vault.  ETH Liquidation Price: 1 ETH = 750 DAI. In this scenario, 13.3 ETH (13.3 * 750 = 10,000) would be the required ETH amount to repay the 10,000 borrowed DAI and ensure DAI\u2019s peg, if liquidation occurs. The remaining 6.7 ETH, minus a liquidity buffer, is excess and the borrower could \u201copt in\u201d into aETH, cETH or other ETH-denominated investments. In the case of liquidation, the liquid (13.3) and the invested (6.7) amount would be returned to the borrower. ",
