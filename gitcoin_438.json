We talk about it with regards to tokens, we talk about it with regards to DAOs, and with regards to the entire ecosystem. Lucky for us, people have been experimenting with governance for ages, using everything from religion, to the feudal systems, to roman republics, to modern democracies. Now in Eth land, we\u2019re able to build on lessons we\u2019ve learned from the past and take governance to the next level. We want to propose a workstream that focuses on Prototyping Governance. Similar to the Prototyping Public Goods Workstream, we want to create a group of builders that:  Prototypes new governance ideas Reviews old models to be revamped/updated Discuss existing and review existing governance solutions used by active protocols  This is something that we\u2019ve both been working on at Govrn and Gnosis now for a while and want to expand it with the GTC community. (For more information on our work in governance, check out our proposals here and here). The goal is to meet once a month to review ideas we\u2019ve all been working on, give guidance to builders in the space, and give out grants on a quarterly basis to the builders and leaders making the best contributions (again following the prototyping public goods model). Our goal is to have an active community of 15-20 builders, with a much larger casual contributor and observer group. Come join us and help build the governance systems we choose to live in.  If you\u2019re interested in either role please comment below! ",

It does feel like at some point it might be possible for builders to break out into their own smaller working groups though as time goes on! ",
