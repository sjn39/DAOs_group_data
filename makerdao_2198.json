I\u2019m creating this post as a way of introducing Tally to Maker, and specifically as a way of exploring potential opportunities for Tally to support SubDAOs as part of the Endgame Plan. Tally is the most popular user interface for OpenZeppelin Governor. We are the preferred on-chain governance solution for many of the large DAOs within the Ethereum ecosystem such as Uniswap, Gitcoin, ENS, Compound, and Hop. The Endgame Plan is based on reorganizing the existing decentralized workforce ecosystem into new self-sustainable SubDAOs. Since each SubDAO is a DAO, it will have its own unique governance token, governance processes, workforce, and interfaces. I think Tally can be a very effective governance resource for Maker SubDAOs. DeFi protocols throughout the Ethereum ecosystem choose to use Tally for two reasons. First, because OpenZeppelin Governor contracts are the best-in-class primitive for trustless treasury management and protocol upgrades. Second, because Tally\u2019s UI offers a well-designed, maintenance-free, no-code, on-chain governance interface for DAO contributors. Protocol DAOs use Tally to create proposals, vote on proposals, facilitate airdrops, attract delegates, delegate voting power, and generally stay up to date with on-chain governance. To check out what it\u2019s like to use Tally, visit https://www.tally.xyz/. To learn more about Tally, visit https://docs.tally.xyz/. I would love to continue this conversation with anyone in the MakerDAO community who is thinking about SubDAO governance. Cheers! ",
