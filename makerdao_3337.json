Specification  Motivation I am proposing this budget for the Protocol Engineering Core Unit to be able to succeed in its mandate, specifically; to extend the functionality of the Maker protocol, assist with the maintenance and operation of existing smart contracts and ensure the safety and correctness of protocol design and implementation. The team\u2019s scope involves a significant level of responsibility and exposure, demonstrated by over $7 billion of total value locked in the Maker Protocol. This is coupled with the constant and necessary addition of collateral types, executive votes and code reviews to ensure protocol safety and growth.  New Information: The title of the team has been updated from Smart Contracts Core Unit to Protocol Engineering Core Unit to better reflect the longer-term growth and our mandate to support ongoing protocol implementation, growth, and safety/security. As per the recently updated Protocol Engineering Core Unit MIP (specifically; Motivation, Team Structure and Layer2 Development sections), this proposal has been updated to include two additional senior engineers focusing on growth and innovation, specifically Layer2 development. All data has been updated to reflect this addition below.   Core Unit Name Protocol Engineering Core Unit  Budget Considerations The following considerations have been taken into account when building the budget to ensure a competitive package that allows the DAO to retain and attract talent by providing:  A competitive salary in-line with industry standards Healthcare to compete with traditional company offerings Travel budgets to promote team visibility and speaking at industry events A sign-on bonus to attract new employees  There is also recognition to support the team by removing blockers and covering overhead costs involved in daily work, including:  Hardware for smart contract deployment and independent testing A bug bounty to promote engagement with community whitehat hackers Funds to support audit activities and code reviews for security awareness Funds to cover gas and contract deployments Overhead support for team filing, accounting, legal and reporting A buffer to accommodate unforeseen costs  Compiling the above considerations along with market/competitor research has helped define the following budget.  Budget The yearly budget request for the Protocol Engineering Core Unit is $6.12m. This equates to a $510k monthly expense to support the team mandate. This budget secures a team of 11 - 16 full-time and part-time smart contract engineers, including a team facilitator. It also includes coverage for all operational costs, audits and overheads as presented below;     Summary      Salaries $4,240,250   Healthcare $228,000   Travel $180,000   Hardware $45,000   Referral & Sign-on Expense $100,000   Audits $375,000   Bug Bounty $100,000   Gas Costs $150,000   SC Verification & Quality Assurance $376,000   Legal and Operating expenses $28,500   Contingency Buffer $297,250       Total $6,120,000    Illustrating these details as a percentage of the total budget request for overall comparison:  919\u00d7434 54 KB   Budget Details: Providing additional detail with regards to the above line items; Salaries: The current team has 9 full-time smart contract engineers, 1 part-time smart contract engineer, and 1 proposed Team Facilitator (for a total of 11 members). The team is seeking to grow this by 5 members to a total of 16 members. This opportunity to scale will enable us to better meet the demands of the community. Healthcare: In order to align with traditional company offerings, this proposal includes a healthcare supplement averaging $1188 p/month for full-time employees, based on residency to account for local cost variations. Travel: Engineers may travel to present at industry events or participate in a team offsite. Hardware: In order to ensure we are able to run multiple ETH nodes to support testing and contract deployment, a supplement for a Dev machine (e.g. Intel Quad Core i7-8565U, 40GB RAM, 512GB NVMe) and test node (e.g. Intel NUC; i5-7300U 2.6 - 3.5 GHz Dual Core, 32GB RAM, 2TB NVMe M.2.) will ensure the team has the hardware in place to achieve this. Referral & Sign-on Expenses: Provided at the discretion of the Facilitator to attract top talent to the team. Audits: We have accounted for approximately 5 audits (depending on the size of the code base being assessed we may need to revisit the budgeted allowance - to be approved by Governance). Typically we work with Gauntlet, PwC, Certora, Quantstamp, Trail of Bits, Consensus, OpenZepplin and Peckshield. Bug Bounty: Bug Bounties allow us to support whitehat involvement in the work we do. Payout amounts will be assessed and determined by the team. $100k is a conservative number for this line item, any increase will be discussed and assessed with Governance. Gas Costs: Based on our deployer addresses in 2020, we spent $36,367 in gas. The 2021 budgeted amount has been extrapolated from the last quarter of gas usage which has seen significantly higher gas congestion. SC Verification & Quality Assurance: Part of the team\u2019s focus is on protocol security by verifying high-level properties of the system along with low level bytecode verification. This involves; full year engagement with a 3rd party, dedicated resources and the use of external tooling, to ensure repeatable quality assurance across smart contracts and the development of new tooling. Legal and Operating Expenses: Coverage for managing general operational overhead, legal costs including entity creation, legal officer/company insurance, as well as monthly and annual financial reporting. Contingency Buffer: Approximately 5% of budgeted costs to be sidelined in the event that we underestimated this budget cycle.  MKR Vesting The Protocol Engineering Team is proposing to award 0.1% of the existing MKR supply to each full-time team member, (equivalent to 995 MKR) vested over 4 years. Example payout: Each person staying with the project for the full first year will be entitled to 25% of their award - the equivalent of 248.75 MKR. For our team of 16 (including both full and part-time employees) this is a total of 3855.625 MKR to be awarded at the end of the first year. For reference, our current annual MKR burn is 34,054 MKR or 3.54% of remaining MKR. Details:     Protocol:      Current MKR supply: ~995,000 MKR   Current annual MKR burn: 3.54% (equivalent to 34,054 MKR)   Proposal:    MKR minting: Governance using DssVest will mint MKR   Allocation per full-time individual over 4 years: 0.1% (equivalent to 995 MKR)   Allocation per part-time individual over 4 years: 0.05% (equivalent to 497.5 MKR)   1 year cliff for full-time individual: 25% of allocation (equivalent to 248.75 MKR)   1 year cliff for part-time individual: 25% of allocation (equivalent to 124.375 MKR)   Total vesting period: 4 years.   Vesting schedule: 25% at the end of the 1st year, 75% at equal increments over the remaining 3 years.   Number of team members: 16   Total team MKR over 4 years (15 full-time and 1 part-time member) 15,422.50 MKR   Total team MKR at the end of 1 year (15 full-time and 1 part-time member) 3,855.625 MKR     What the budget does not include: Additional Audits: We have budgeted for up to $375k in audits, each audit typically costs between $50-$100k. If we exceed this amount, we will request further funding and approval from Governance. Increased Gas Expenses: We have budgeted up to $150k in gas costs. If we exceed this amount, we will request further funding and approval from Governance. Keeper costs: We expect a technical/operations domain team to maintain Keepers, including chief keeper, cage keeper, auction kickers and more. As a result, we have not accounted for maintenance or gas costs of keeping keepers operational.  Conditions - Continuous Operation To ensure 3 months of continuous operation in the event of emergency shutdown or protocol issues, the Protocol Engineering Team will be requesting an upfront lump-sum of $1.3m to sit in a protocol owned multisig. Calculation: The lump sum is the equivalent of 3 months of budgeted salaries and essential team expenses. Detail:  The lump-sum will be held outside of the surplus buffer in a protocol owned multisig If normal protocol operation is not possible due to emergency shutdown or other protocol failure, these funds will be used to ensure employment resources get the system back up and functional At the conclusion of the year, the lump sum will remain in the multisig for the following year and may be increased at that point in time due to team growth or the desire for an increased runway.   Updated multisig details for clarity - Smart Contract Implementation Protocol Engineering Core Unit Multisig: 0xe2c16c308b843eD02B09156388Cb240cEd58C01c  Implementation: Initial distribution to the Core Unit multisig will be manual until the Keg is in place. Ownership: This multisig will be anonymous individuals selected by the Protocol Engineering Team. Frequency: Protocol distributions to the multisig will occur during the last week of the month.  Protocol Engineering Continuous Operation Multisig: 0x83e36aAA1c7b99E2D3d07789F7b70FCe46f0d45E  Implementation: This multisig will be funded in full upon successful onboarding of the Protocol Engineering Core Unit. Access: In order for funds to be accessed from this multisig, the Maker protocol must be in a state where it is unable to pay team salaries due to protocol error, shutdown and/or under governance attack. Ownership: The Continuous Operation Multisig will require 3 of 6 signatures from the following keyholders. This may be expanded to other critical Core Units as they are formed:  Derek (Protocol Engineering): 0xe3a76328edE8Fd61d5fA7840b878Dd69cdfD67d8 Nadia (Growth CU): 0xc8E6c287F6c127AFE5e4CB30bC440607b44c35f8 LongForWisdom (GovAlpha) : 0x66f40F044E0e2F77bB746e3275E82e88dCBA2D69 Primoz (Risk CU): 0x5d67d5B1fC7EF4bfF31967bE2D2d7b9323c1521c SebVentures (RWF): 0x0D61C8b6CA9669A36F351De3AE335e9689dd9C5b Cmooney (Protocol Engineering): 0xEeF3026eF864C9398c008195E65d16D9cb42a512 For transparency: I had previously identified keyholders as CU multisigs (namely: Protocol Engineering, the Interim DAO Multisig and the Growth CU), however due to complexity of using nested multisigs, I updated this to individuals.

This module would allow the minting of new MKR - so as long as the amount of MKR minted is less than the burn rate, MKR would remain in a state of net deflation. I chose an absolute MKR value as a percentage of existing supply due to simplicity and the ability to provide all members with an equal incentive.

It would also be unlikely to offer a long-term incentive once the bonus is paid.

I get that it reduces the cost in the short-term but 1) down the line new supply is created and 2) there\u2019s a scenario in which the team doesn\u2019t get its MKR vesting because not enough tokens are burned, perhaps because the Surplus needs to rise rapidly due to growth, or because MKR are created for another reason. (Aside from a debt auction, you can imagine a scenario where multiple teams adopt the same model, and only one or two actually get the MKR.) Also, minor point, but weighting the vesting towards the end of the period (e.g. 10-20-30-40%) would help retain talent for the full term. ",

In a bit more detail: Minting MKR tokens from the protocol can occur regardless of whether the surplus buffer is positive or negative. Minting MKR tokens increases the supply, yes, but - what is critical (in the eyes of MKR holders) is for MKR to retain its deflationary narrative and therefore increase in value over time. This occurs when burning > minting. Whatever vesting mechanism is chosen, this needs to remain the case. If, as you suggest, we flip the model and instead have tokens collected from the existing supply, we would decrease the current buy/burn rate in favour of splitting it into burn/allocate amounts. This would expose us to fluctuations in the price of MKR which means it would be unwise to offer an absolute MKR award because you have no idea of knowing the dollar value of what that might actually be - hence a $ value would be more suitable in such a scenario - but then I think this removes the appeal of a vested interest in the appreciation of the MKR token. Interesting, I\u2019ll explore the variable weighting over time idea you mentioned. ",

In an ideal world, though, I would hope/expect that everyone who worked for the DAO on any kind of longer-term basis would be rewarded with some MKR. It\u2019s not just about the financial reward; it incentivises them to help MakerDAO succeed and grow Dai adoption, gives a sense of loyalty, ownership and agency, and critically enables people to vote for proposals they think will do that as well as what they do in their day jobs. Obviously, there\u2019s a limit to how much MKR it will be possible to mint without causing inflation. Should multiple groups suggest what you have (which seems quite likely), there are risks they would not get their rewards or that governance would have to take some kind of action. Perhaps people have other ideas about how demand for MKR from Core Units could be met most effectively. ",

Our skills are highly sought after and other protocols are trying to recruit us. By lunchtime I\u2019ll have a handful of linkedin messages trying to poach me, this happens every day. Others on the team have the same experience. Many SC team devs have succumbed to this siren song in the past year, and we need to compensate to dampen that. We\u2019d all thrive in both tech and quantitative finance, and these numbers were adapted from leading firms in those industries.

Scenario #1: Maker mints 1000 MKR that sits in a vesting contract for 4 years with occasional payouts. Scenario #2: Half of vat DAI accrued goes to FLAP auctions but instead of the MKR being burned it goes to the vesting contract until it accrues 1000 MKR which goes to occasional payouts over 4 years (in this circumstance). Although I think that in the wash, Scenario #1 is probably more efficient, Scenario #2 is probably more digestible by all MKR holders because they get some immediate benefit from it. Would love to hear your thoughts on this. ",

I don\u2019t like MIP42 and I do not like printing MKR for any reason whatsoever except when the protocol needs refinancing. Once MKR is printed for any other reason MKR prints will be proposed for practically all good causes.

Second, the Maker protocol is pretty complex. In general, it takes a long time to onboard sufficiently. Coupled with the criticality of the protocol, it takes even longer since core code contributions demand impeccable understanding of the system.

Our focus is on protecting property of users and the reputation of the protocol.

I would say that you might want to reconsider what to expect from a professional smart contract development team. I should also mention that no code was changed as a result of Black Thursday. A mis-optimized governance parameter is not \u201cbuggy code\u201d and I resent the implication here. Honestly, I\u2019ve enjoyed working for the Foundation, especially when the Maker Protocol aligned with my ideals as an exclusively crypto-focused project. Now that the DAO has decided to branch out into Real World Assets the protocol is becoming more like a traditional bank, and if you want to hire senior devs in this space to work here the protocol will need to compensate them as a bank would.

You are right, of course, that it is impossible to guarantee 4years of continuous work for individuals. What should be possible, though (and what I meant), is to guarantee 4years of smooth and continuous work for the Core Unit. This might involve finding good replacements, educating them, etc, of course. We (governance) we need to hear your requests (the Budget proposal) and your ambitions, and align them as much as possible with those of MKR holders (i.e., with yours too!). What the MakerDAO needs is:  Good and happy developers/contributors, with the right incentives to act good (like MKR vesting, but again, I think it should be subject to work being done properly, as you did in the past). a CoreUnit that might eventually duplicate itself, so to spread out risk and horizontally increase competences, to reduce the risk of being too dependent of a single Core Unit  ",

Some of your reasoning seems to be based on current annual MKR burn but in 4 years the amount of MKR you\u2019re proposing to mint will probably be a much larger % of that MKR burn. So let\u2019s say in 4 years we 10x and burn % stays the same. We\u2019d be burning 3400 MKR a year which is roughly the amount you would be getting at the end of the 4 years. Is my math right there? Yes I realize burn is closer to 4.5% right now. Whoops I forgot to account for revenues also increasing by 10x so it would still be the same % of burn. Like @iammeeoh said below it would be 10% of annual burn which is more digestible to me personally  than what I originally thought.

Derek:  Current annual MKR  34,054 MKR   and     Derek:  this is a total of 3358.125 MKR to be awarded at the end of the first year.

Or, similarly, what if some money is lost, we lose the SB and need to refill it? Again, this will reduce the amount of burns, but not the compensation of the SC team. What if, for some reasons, SF have to go down (to keep the peg) and we reach 1% SF as in the past?  PROPOSAL: What if we, more transparently, agree on a certain percentage (e.g., 10%) of the MKR burns to go to the Core Unit? Like, for each 1MKR sent to the burning mechanism, only 0.9MKR are really burned, and 0.1 are sent to the SC Core Unit.

So, in principle, I am ok with 10% of the income of MakerDAO going to, e.g., the SC Core Unit. However, in case MKR are not burnt as expected (for whatever reason) and/or MKR price does not fly up, I don\u2019t find equally justifiable to give so much reward to the Core Unit. Conclusion: I think there should be more alignment between the requests (995 MKR after 4 years) and the (hard to predict) performance of MakerDAO and MKR as a token. ",

The growth in TVL, DAI, and Interest Income has been absolutely tremendous! I think governance needs to seriously consider what their token compensation philosophy and objectives are. In my mind, our goals should be to:  Attract and retain the best possible talent Promote the achievement of key strategy and financial performance Motivate long-term value creation; and Align the interests of parties receiving token compensation with all stakeholders  To achieve these objectives, I believe we should:  Have competitive positioning of pay versus our peers Deliver a significant portion of pay in the form of variable, at-risk compensation Align performance measures with strategy Use a combination of vehicles that collectively promote the achievement of positive results, retention and sustainable long-term value creation  Looking at the proposed plan, I do not believe we are fully aligned with the above principles. My suggestion would be to at least make half of the token compensation at-risk and subject to achieving performance objectives. Ideally, this compensation would be 80%+ and a mix of a cash bonus and token compensation (70-80% weighted to the token compensation). The token compensation would be broken up into three different categories:  Token Options (30%) \u2013 incentivizes long-term sustainable value creation Time-based Restricted Token Units (RTUs) (35%) \u2013 promotes retention and aligns interests of recipients with those of stakeholders Performance-based RTUs (35%) \u2013 enables governance to reward recipients for performance that is in the long-term strategic importance for the protocol and stakeholders. Subject to a multiplier based on relative achievement of performance objectives.  Additionally and as mentioned earlier in the thread, the phasing of the token compensation should be weighted more towards the longer term. Is a year 1 smart contract engineer worth the same as a year 3 or 4 on this team? I would think not. My suggestion would be something along the lines of: 18%, 22%, 27%, and 33%. The performance objectives, given the compensation potential and variability, would likely generate a lot of discussion if the community decides to pursue this direction. The below are suggestions from someone very new to the MKR community and intended only as a starting point/example of the direction I believe we should head. As the engine of the MKR protocol, I believe the Smart Contract Core Unit Performance Objectives should be tied in with higher level KPI\u2019s. Performance Objectives:  DAI generated Risk-Weighted Assets DAI market share Net Interest Income Number of Collateral Onboarded Real World Asset Growth Unfavorable Liquidations Additional risk-related metric to ensure growth is sustainable  Given the importance of token compensation, I believe governance should consider hiring a third party compensation consultant to design a plan. This is out of my area of expertise and given the current feedback the proposal has received, most others as well. ",

It is for me super interesting to be here, now, and witness the first baby steps of a multi-billion worth DAO budget definition.  Your Core Unit, being amazing, is a fantastic source of insights and ideas for discussion. The more I think about it, the more I think my proposal (which I am now going to iterate in more details) might be interesting for you, other Core Units, and MKR-holders too. PROPOSAL (in more details):   [Basic Methods] Beside the monthly salary in USD, the Core Unit will receive a percentage p (from 0% to 100%) of the MKR sent to the burner. When a MKR is sent to burn, only (100-p)% are actually burned, and p% are sent to the Core Unit.  [Quality Control] At each time interval (e.g., monthly or quarterly) governance can adjust the value p, in accordance to predetermined agreements: e.g., if everything went well, p should remain constant. If the CoreUnit acted poorly/badly, p will be reduced in accordance to pre-agreed terms&rules.  [Flexibility/Bureaucracy-free] The MKR sent to the Core Unit are managed by the Facilitator. The facilitator will distribute these MKR to its collaborators accordingly to their own rules: releasing them gradually/at the end, giving more to senior contributors/all equal, etc. In other words, MakerDAO trusts the Facilitator to act properly on this (and of course will overlook for good behaviour over time).  [Guarantees for Core Unit] MakerDAO agrees a certain minimum percentage q (from 0% to 100%) that, for the next 4 years, will be used to burn MKR. For instance currently have q=0, because we are using all of our gains to increase the Surplus and we are not burning. This would not be possible if we had set q=50% because q=50% would require to use at least 50% of the gains to burn MKR, and not for other purposes.  \u2192 Note: the \u201cother purposes\u201d include paying Core Unit salaries, increasing the Surplus, etc.  Example for discussion: Let us assume, for reference to the current Budget proposal, that we set q=50% and p=20%. This means that  for the next 4 years, at least q=50% of the profits of MakerDAO will go to Burning and MKR-premiums to Core Units. Using @Derek 's numbers, this means today \frac{50}{100} \\cdot 34,054 = 17,027 MKR/year. Of course this number might go up and down in time (depending on the value of MKR and the profits of MakerDAO). The rest of the profits, not sent to the burner, will be used to grow the Surplus and/or to pay monthly salaries to Core units, etc. Each year, the SC Core Unit will get p \\cdot  17,027 = 0.2\\cdot 17,027 = 3405.4 MKR/year. This is about what @Derek asked (3358.125 MKR) in his proposal. The remaining portion of the MKR to be burned (17,027 - 3405,4 = 13621.6 MKR/year) will be burned or, more likely, partially used to pay other Core Units  and partially used to burn.  What I like about this proposal is:  it requires MakerDAO to make a strategical (long term) choice of the values q and p: how much do we want to send to the burner (q), how much of the burner we want to re-direct to the Core Unit (p) and how much we want to keep for growth/salaries/etc (1-q). It aligns incentives between MKR-holders and Core Unit contributors. MKR holders are happy if the DAO grows well and MKR are burnt (as a buy-back procedure for distributing gains). This has been the model of MakerDAO from the very beginning of its design.    It also gives Core Unit members stake in the game, both in the case of things going very well and bad.   It is a predictable model. As in @Aaron_Bartsch, we avoid the situation of having to pay 10s of millions to each Core Unit members (potentially more than what MakerDAO earns!) should the price of MKR go up like crazy in the next 4 years (which is what we all hope for!)

                    "content": "This proposal uses a top-tier compensation package which is far from the framework other proposals have used. There is nothing good or bad about it. It doesn\u2019t seem fair to me that the average SC dev is 4x the highest rank in Governance or Risk. Actually, even the junior one is way above thanks to the MKR reward. That doesn\u2019t mean SC compensation is wrong. All is a question of framework and fairness which are important to keep a team cohesion over the long run. My main concern is to see some Core Units as important and others as secondary. Tech is a prerequisite but doesn\u2019t make a success. Balancer has better tech than Uniswap but fails to have a proper UX (seems like web/app developers matters as much as smart contracts after all). xDAI is great technically but probably fails due to UX and business development. The guy that can sign an integration contract with Coinbase, Kraken and Binance is worth more than all the tech team. The vampire mining attack of Sushiswap matters more than the tech. Legal and lobbying might soon be about MakerDAO survival. And, lastly, governance might matter in a successful DAO. Not saying SC shouldn\u2019t be paid more, but the framework should be the same. If you agree on that, it\u2019s a lot of MKR to allocate (but not that much neither depending on how you look at it, what is 5-10% dilution to create a workforce from scratch?). There is a good old discussion where Rune is highlighting the importance of culture and wanting to use academia as a standard (it was only about risk at the time).  Whether it is underpaid, or overpaid, depends on what you\u2019re comparing it to. It\u2019s a fundamental question of what kind of culture we want the risk teams and the governance community to have, and a question of how to get real long term value for money. In my opinion the question of culture is one of the most critical points that must be innovated on to prevent maker from falling into the pitfalls that has plagued traditional finance. I also think a good place to look for compensation standards would be research universities and how research positions at such institutions are compensated.

I can also quote an interesting passage:  Being a risk team shouldn\u2019t be a privilege and it shouldn\u2019t be the new alternative to getting a job on wall street, it should be a duty and a public service, and thus be compared with public servant, regulator, academic, and central banker roles.  in reference to this sentence:     brianmcmichael:  Now that the DAO has decided to branch out into Real World Assets the protocol is becoming more like a traditional bank, and if you want to hire senior devs in this space to work here the protocol will need to compensate them as a bank would.   Also, not providing any judgment or conclusion here. On the one hand we can\u2019t expect people to work for the \u2018glory\u2019 and we should reward valuable contributors (especially long-time contributors). On the other hand it is true that MakerDAO does not want to be a bank or compete/align with their salary practices, as Rune pointed out. We need to find some equilibrium in between. ",

I can state (with 100% confidence) that one of the most effective compensation academics receive in research universities is TENURE.  Most people starting postdocs after their PhD, and trying to do an academic career, are attracted to tenure way (way!) more than money. Tenure is about intellectual freedom, job security, stable and respected position: for a life-long period. I am not sure how we can reason about something like this in the context of Maker. But if we are talking about \u2018academic culture\u2019, tenure is one of its pillars. But yeah, the Academic environment is very different than the Banking/Financial environment in that one proposes a life-long secure/respected/interesting career (with a decent salary but nothing crazy) the other proposes a model based on few years of very intensive work, borderline immoral, paid like crazy and oriented towards quitting and retiring early.

                    "content": "For reference, here is data about salaries for Postdocs (i.e., non-tenured, fixed-term, project-oriented researchers holding PhDs) around the world: Results - PostDoc Salaries Examples include:  University of California - San Diego (UCSD, Electrical and computer engineering): $52k usd/year  ETH Zurich\tComputer Science Department: $88k /year  Harvard University (Computer Science): $70k/year  mcgill university (Computer Science): $45k/year   not to mention excellence research places around the western world (e.g., France/UK/Germany/Italy) where the salary can be even lower. Staying in the US, and talking about full professors, we have the following figures (Ivy league): The average salaries of Ivy League university professors  Professors at top schools can make more than $175,000 a year. Harvard University professors make the most compared to other Ivy League faculty members \u2014 they earn $226,394 per year.  Recall that being a full Prof. at the above institutions reflects a life devoted to research, incredible talent, impressive results and decades of hard work. Looking at CV one of the new SC talents (@sctannr , https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilfred-allard, who introduced himself above in this thread) I see a good CV, a promising young talent. Indeed! But I also think that:  it\u2019s kind of crypto-bubble to realise that He (or anyone with a similar profile) will get more than a Harvard full professor for 4 years (250k/year, as in the budge proposal). But ok, it is the merit of being early in a new space!   It\u2019s even more crazy to see that he will receive 995 MKR (about 2 millions) in 4 years (again, as in the budget proposal).  No judgments, no conclusions\u2026 just some Food for Thought.  Addendum: I have been contacted in the chat by a community member (not SC team). They asked me if I was even aware of  salaries in the industry (such as: https://www.levels.fyi/). Of course I am. I just kept discussing academic salaries, following the line of reasoning of Rune\u2019s old post and my previous point about tenure and all. Let me re-state what I stated earlier in this thread:     iammeeoh:  First of all let me say: I personally would approve this budget.   and     iammeeoh:  What the MakerDAO needs is:  Good and happy developers/contributors, with the right incentives to act good (like MKR vesting, but again, I think it should be subject to work being done properly, as you did in the past). a CoreUnit that might eventually duplicate itself, so to spread out risk and horizontally increase competences, to reduce the risk of being too dependent of a single Core Unit    I was just providing some (hopefully) food for thought. Please don\u2019t think I am against the SC team or anything like that. Let\u2019s be clear: MakerDAO needs them. Absolutely needs them. So yeah, we are just discussing and trying to define the \u2018culture\u2019 (more than the concrete numbers) about MakerDAO compensation. ",

Absolutely, they dedicate their lives to research to get to where they are. But labor, or time, is not the only input to that revenue function. Nor are credential levels alone. Especially in such a forward thinking industry as ours. The former would be Marxist and the latter would mean that if I were a post doc specializing in 18th century Art, I should make more than a blockchain engineer. But it\u2019s demand that dictates our pay. Certainly crypto is hot right now, but make no mistake: the skills I and others have on this team are not novelty and quick tricks one learns from going through a crypto zombies tutorial. It is fundamentals, deep understanding of difficult topics that took thousands of hours to become even remotely adept - that is what allows us to do what we do. I am new to Maker, yes. I do no not have a PhD or even a Masters degree. But I live and breathe my discipline. I went to sleep at 5AM and woke up at 9AM today because I was working on formal proofs of Maker - types of proofs that you will not find any other verification tool in the crypto space capable of tackling, even though many of those projects are developed by doctorate-holding researchers with decades of experience. They could if they wanted to, but when you take a bunch of developers by trade with a love for logic and experience in blockchain systems, you get a special combination that exploits the synergistic power of theoretical knowledge for deep understanding grounded by practical experience to ensure value is delivered timely and in a user friendly way. Everyone on the SC team lives and breathes their discipline. I am humbled by how good this team is, in both character and skill. I am honored to work on this incredible project, and I only hope that when more info about this work is shared in the near future, the community is as happy about it as I am. ",

We have researched what the industry is paying and this proposal is, we think a fair one, that will retain developers in this space. Even then, this doesn\u2019t even put the team among the highest paid in the space, so we\u2019re still relying on other aspects of culture for retention. I think there\u2019s a lot of hang up on the token distribution here. These numbers are percentages, adapted from employee equity plans used industry-wide and by Maker\u2019s own VC investors. Anyone who is still here in four years is absolutely worth this amount to the protocol, because you simply can not buy that sort of experience. Keep in mind that many will take better offers elsewhere or simply burn out of this role, and the community will not have to pay out the distribution. The team, however, will lose that experience and the protocol will be less secure and less stable because of it. This system is non-trivial and there are many moving parts, a misstep can cause all of it to vanish, every experienced dev on this project is worth their weight in MKR. ",

We have to understand the SC team context: what they have done for the protocol and what others are willing to pay for a team like this. Although I keep thinking about what someone mentioned in our previous Governance call: How do we know a team is performing well? And I bring this question to the thread because if we all agree that the SC team is doing a fantastic job (as they are) and showing it by clear OKRs, I think the MKR vesting proposal makes total sense. I understand MKR vesting is a strategy to achieve retention. Still, it also could be used as an incentive to create a meritocratic environment, where the best performances are correctly identified and rewarded. I agree with what Tosh said:     Tosh9.0:  a growth unit (which, imo, should have a heavier emphasis on performance-connected comp/commissions)   and that is the reason why we decided to tie the quarterly bonus with each contributor\u2019s performance. Each mandate is different, and it would be great for both the CU and the governance to establish OKRs that help MakerDAO stay focused, aligned, and engaged. ",

                    "content": "Let\u2019s also take a step back and think about valuation - based on Seb\u2019s fantastic  financial presentation, our forward annualized earnings are ~68M, about a 70% net margin off of 95M in revenue (net margin interest). Today, the market cap of MKR sits at 2.22B, meaning our fwd P/E (price to earnings) ratio is 32.7. The Nasdaq trades at 36.6 today, or at a 12% premium to MKR (!). For a business that grew net income 16x in 2020 and is on pace to grow 7.6x this year, this is CRIMINALLY low. For reference, Coinbase grew revenues ~2.4x in 2020 vs 2019 and swung from a -6% net margin to a 10% margin. Based on the private market, many investors expect Coinbase to trade at 30-70x forward revenues when it finally goes public. Consensus forward revenues is around $2B for 2021 which would imply a market cap of $60-$140B! What would Coinbase be trading at if it was on pace to grow revenues at the same rate as MKR? Or if it had a net margin anywhere near MKR? In my opinion, MKR would have to 5x from here to be closer to \u2018fairly\u2019 valued. To be clear, I\u2019m talking about the price of the token here, not the revenue or net interest income. Look at AAVE for example, they have about the same net interest income and $1.5B less TVL, yet they trade at 3x MKR\u2019s market cap on a fully diluted basis. Are their token economics that much better than ours? If MKR became a \u2018household\u2019 name to the extent Bitcoin or Ethereum are, I could see it 10-20x higher than current prices (higher in the future if fundamentals continue to improve). A few additional questions for @Derek  Presumably we will need to continue growing the team in y2/3/4 correct? What compensation would you propose for them? The same DAI but in MKR terms or would these be more junior members and they would be compensated less? Have you considered a shorter vesting schedule? 4 years is an eternity in crypto Could you provide the comps used for the token compensation? With MKR\u2019s volatility, should the token schedule be based on a 30-day weighted average of the price of MKR (in DAI terms)? If MKR doubles in the next two weeks before the proposal is finalized the comp increases dramatically  Generally, I think people are overly concerned with the dilution and token compensation, as long as everyone\u2019s interests are aligned I don\u2019t see an issue with paying at or above market rates for top tier smart contract talent. My assumption is that one of the key bottlenecks to growing the protocol is having enough capable hands on the smart contract team and that we need to be investing here to keep growing. Really we should be investing in all areas (risk, governance, growth, real-world finance, marketing, etc) and growing as fast as we can in a safe and sustainable way. This is the same strategy tech companies use today, grow as fast as possible and grab as much market share as possible. Build the best possible product/market offering and profits will come. If we do that, everyone involved will profit handsomely  ",

I see this being a bureaucratically-governance-intensive task across the community when we should focus on getting things built. Hypothetically, this would give the team a 1 year bonus, reviewed every year based on the previous year\u2019s performance. However! \u2026 With that said, I would hesitate to see the longer term vesting model disappear because it provides a clear incentive to remain with the program at a point when one\u2019s skills will be the most sort after - and naturally the incentive to stay is comparable. I can\u2019t stress how much knowledge and system complexity is in the minds of employees who have been with us for longer periods of time. It\u2019s worth reiterating that if the team (or team facilitator) is underperforming they can be removed by Governance at any time.      Planet_X:  maybe it would be beneficial to provide a bit of historical context on this subject? How have developers been paid in the 2016-20 timeframe?   It\u2019s difficult to draw any significance from a historical point of view because the nature of demand for certain skills has changed so rapidly in recent years. Currently, it is the real-world competition and demand that has driven up the value of individuals which gets us to where we are now - competing protocols and top tier companies are our competitors. Levels.xyz , Glassdoor and competing forum blogs provide some insight into this. I will say that this proposal has kick-started a number of discussions with senior engineers in the industry (external to Maker) who are expressing interest in what we are doing. I\u2019m not going to jump the gun yet, but this is a promising sign to see us being able to get the attention of individuals to support future team growth.  @TheoRochaix and @Tosh9.0 thank you for your support. In similar threads calling out value propositions of different teams, namely from @Guy and @SebVentures , I agree that this proposal is different to other teams - I built it up to be independently competitive with market rates and competing industry offers for smart contract developers. I\u2019m not opposed to a broader framework if it takes this proposal into account.  @iammeeoh thank you for sourcing the academic data and raising the notion of tenure as food for thought in the context of culture. I think everyone realises the competitive market we are in and that the free market has shown that we will struggle to retain employees if the economic incentive is greater elsewhere. I do however think you raise a great point about culture and work hygiene. It\u2019s a much much bigger topic than this thread can cover but in due course I would like to delve into this with the community - the attitudes, beliefs and behaviours that shape us as Maker are important and define why employees (not just engineers) want to work for Maker.      Nadia:  it would be great for both the CU and the governance to establish OKRs that help MakerDAO stay focused, aligned, and engaged.   Thanks Nadia, indeed, we plan to illustrate clear OKRs, and if they change throughout the quarter, we need to communicate why. This is a challenge in crypto because things move so fast, however I\u2019m certain that with our community and governance discussion channels we will be able to continue being transparent.      Aes:  In my opinion, MKR would have to 5x from here to be closer to \u2018fairly\u2019 valued.   Yes! But there is a lot of work to safely get us there and beyond. Regarding team growth. In the first year we have accounted for growing the team by 5 individuals. (currently we have a team of 9). It is expected that these new team members will receive the same MKR, vesting from their start date, as the rest of the existing team members. This budget and growth within the first year is based on meeting current demand. For growth in following years we will submit a new proposal for Governance approval. My initial thoughts were that this would be less MKR due to lower risk but would be structured as the same 4 year vesting plan to incentivise long term commitment. Just a note here on the 4 year vesting \u2026I want to emphasise that It is very unlikely for people to stay in a role for 4 years in this industry. We want our team members to remain because their knowledge at years 2, 3, 4 is incredibly valuable - to know where the skeletons are in the closet and why certain technical approaches work or not saves weeks and weeks of work. I am trying to match the incentive with this skillset. Initially to attract, and then to retain. ^ this eternity in crypto is indeed a long time, which is why the MKR is unlikely to be paid out in full - but if it is, we really deserve those people. Also, during this time we remain accountable to Governance. Alternatively, if we were pursue a 1 year timeframe we may get things out the door quicker to reach a goal but we lose the vested interest in making the protocol secure over the longer term. Regarding MKR volatility - we proposed a % of supply, which I don\u2019t see changing in the coming weeks regarding the existing surplus. If there is some dramatic change, I think it\u2019s reasonable to raise it here for reevaluation. @Aes, you raise good ideas in both your posts thank you. I am still giving thought to the performance based suggestions you had in your first post and will respond when I have a formulated my thoughts.  It\u2019s challenging to convey emotion in forum posts, but I want everyone to know I am grateful for the effort and thought you have put in replying here. Much of this is still being considered and discussed with various stakeholders as we work towards the end of the RFC period. ",

The purpose of a stock option is to align investor goals with employees. It is not designed to be guaranteed money. Maker will be more volatile over the next 4 years then facebook or Google stock however it also has the potential for much greater multiplicative returns. I would also add the proposal is to mint new maker for the SC team at no cost. This is not the same as a stock option A stock option would imply we instead give the smart contract team the right to buy maker at a set price and this option only has value if the price of maker goes up.

However, we have not landed on an agreement for the MKR reward, as a result the team has decided to put forward our original proposal for on-chain MKR voters to decide.   Due to ongoing discussion of the compensation framework, we reserve the right to switch from our MKR vesting plan to the MKR framework that the community has begun discussing, but has yet to agree on. We hope that a suitable overarching vesting framework will be chosen and backdated to the commencement date of the core unit(s). Therefore, we are submitting our proposal as it exists above, with the option, not the obligation, of switching to a community determined MKR compensation framework if/once it is agreed upon.   As per the update to MIP39c2-SP#7, specifically: \u201ccommunity discussion during the RFC process indicated that we should also give immediate attention to laying the groundwork to promote future protocol growth and innovation, in particular L2 development\u201d. I have increased the number of team members by two, included in the budgeted costs.   ",

I\u2019m aware you\u2019re not spending all of that in the year, but it is something you need to operate, and governance doesn\u2019t have access to those funds anymore (as I understand.)

Given the heat in the space probably reasonable but I would honestly expect some pretty high team turnover rates within these 4 year periods because of this - so plan accordingly by staggering quality hires. Hence my next question.   If turn-over is going to be high how is the team going to find and retain the next people?   Also what sort of non-compete clauses are there (any?).  I mean I don\u2019t want a Maker smart contract dev just up and going somewhere else to fork the protocol or to compete with it. It is going to be interesting to total up these Core unit costs and look at the current revenue rate because right now I am seeing some pretty big numbers being put up and I am only on the the second core team. Begs a question who is integrating the financials on all these core units into a kind of business expense run report based on the asks here?

Last time I ran this came up at 115M/yr being the current revenue rate P/R 19.2,   57M/yr expense doubles this as a P/E, 83M quadruples it. We talk about having sufficient funds for operations and whining about having a surplus in the 60-100M and not burning MKR to achieve this as fast as possible when expense run rates looks to be in the 50-80M/yr range??!   I mean sure we can always print MKR, but we really need to be thinking about a secondary reserve as I can see pulling these funds from surplus during bad times could easily start minting MKR. I am back to how much MKR does the foundation have left for these kinds of expenses that will be folded back into the DAO proper as a kind of \u2018rainy day fund\u2019.

Personally, I am not quite convinced this could be applied as a blanket measure across all types of roles within the MakerDAO Core Units.     iammeeoh:  I can state (with 100% confidence) that one of the most effective compensation academics receive in research universities is TENURE. Most people starting postdocs after their PhD, and trying to do an academic career, are attracted to tenure way (way!) more than money.   It\u2019s quite difficult seeing Software Engineering type of activities fitting into that box. It\u2019s quite a collaborative and peer-review heavy approach comparing to other functions. Think of pair-programming for example. For Risk teams, I personally agree that approach can be valid, particularly when it involves modelling parameters. There is relatively little review of existing models by independent teams to allow the research-like activities that you find in modelling teams even within banks and other economics institutions. That leads to potentially not ideal outcomes and a lot of trust given to Risk teams without checking frameworks. While this was OKish when the protocol had just a feel million staked, lack of model documentation and reproducibility by other teams is one of the biggest risks to MakerDAO as the protocol grows.

I totally agree. Perhaps it sounded like I was proposing tenure for the SC team. I was not. Just to be clear, I was just expanding on the Reddit quote from rune:  I also think a good place to look for compensation standards would be research universities and how research positions at such institutions are compensated.  I agree that tenure is a very expensive instrument. It is most definitely not what is needed in a startup/experiment/young-DAO like MakerDao. At least not at this stage.     PaperImperium:  It\u2019s been studied to death in the economics literature and academics with tenure on average publish less, in less influential journals, teach less, and their students report lower satisfaction from their teaching.   It has also been studied that researchers are more likely to commit fraud, publish fake results, target h-index pumps rather than honest research, etc, if they are under the pressure of \u201crenew the contract\u201d or \u201capply for the next job\u201d. From wikipedia:  Tenure is a means of defending the principle of academic freedom, which holds that it is beneficial for society in the long run if scholars are free to hold and examine a variety of views.  Anyway, MakerDAO is not academia. So I 100% agree with you guys that the tenure system is not appropriate for what we are doing here now. ",

For me the low hanging fruit is risk modelling.   I kind of agree with this. But in my opinion (as a tenured academic myself), the best approach is not to replicate academia \u201coutside\u201d academia, but to interact with academia. For instance,  fund PhD/PostDoc scholarships on the topics that we care about (at the \u2018fundamental research\u2019 level). Sponsor academic conferences, run workshops, etc Try to create incentives/rewards for our (research-oriented) Core Units to publish in good conferences/journals (to get peer-review external feedbacks), etc. \u2192 A good example is RWF in my opinion.  As far as I know the CMU has a substantial amount of MKR, donated to them by one of MakerDAO founders: MakerDAO co-creator donates $1.4 million in MKR to Carnegie Mellon | Modern Consensus. That would be a good (top level) institution to start interacting with academia.  ",

Derek:  The current team has 9 full-time smart contract engineers, 1 part-time smart contract engineer, and 1 proposed Team Facilitator (for a total of 11 members). The team is seeking to grow this by 5 members to a total of 16 members. This opportunity to scale will enable us to better meet the demands of the community.   @Derek I understand you are busy however at some point could you provide an update on PE unused funds? Based on makerburn.com on 14 PE members are currently vesting so I guess we should expect unused funds to be returned at some point. Right? ",

I have and intend to provide per-monthly categorised expenses from the PE team, but would like to provide descriptive context first around some of our audit, software and tooling costs so it makes sense to the community. This will include both surplus (salaries) and deficit amounts (audits and gas deployment costs). Keep at me about this, early December should be a quieter time for me to complete this task and provide an insightful report. ",
