After much deliberation, @Primoz presented on his analysis of ETH risk.        docs.google.com    ETH-A Risk Premium ETH-A Risk Premium Risk Model Simulations 3rd September 2020      With this in mind, it looks like it ultimately falls onto the Maker Community (with this knowledge in hand) to choose a risk premium for ourselves. Therefore, I would once again like to request a signal whether to increase the ETH-A RP. What should the Risk Premium of ETH-A be?     0% (No Change) .25% .50% 1% 1.5% 2% More than 2% Abstain     0 voters     Polling will end 2020-09-15T04:00:00Z after which the results will be added as a pull request to be included in the following Monday\u2019s governance schedule.

Determining a value that takes into account perceived long term risk and then keeping it there is probably the best bet for now, at least until we overhaul the way we set stability fees. I could see ETH-A going as high as 4% for RP and then at least we can focus on other things. My main concern is trying to keep track of weekly rate changes from BR adjustments at this point. I hope someone can come up with a better way to do this soon. ",

With the ratification and creation of the base rate, we should begin to look at that as the lever to use to encourage DAI supply growth/retraction. Therefore I am asking the community whether it is time to re-add/add a risk premium to ETH-A to insure the Maker system against future ETH collapse. I look forward to your feedback. Pros:  MakerDAO begins collecting surplus from ETH-A (Positive impact on MKR price) Collected ETH-A stability fees go towards insuring future defaults Promotes the use of adjusting the Base Rate instead of Risk Premium  Cons:  May temporarily reduce DAI supply from ETH-A (as we adjust to using base rate)  Should we increase the ETH-A Risk Premium?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     What should the ETH-A Risk Premium be?     .25% .50% 1% 2% Let Risk Team decide Abstain     0 voters     This poll will run until Wednesday, August 5th to provide ample discussion. If you can think of any other pros/cons I will be sure to add them to the overview. Looking forward to hearing the communities thoughts on the matter! ",

You can just hoard the DAI and it doesn\u2019t cost you anything. You can use up all the debt ceiling and just troll the whole system. Having 0% risk premium is not very smart from a game theoretical perspective. It is better to hoard up all the DAI for free than to hope that someone else does not take the free DAI before you. After all the yield farming craze is over, I am guessing that DAI will dive below the peg very hard. ",

I actually have a sneaking suspicion that increasing the SF/RP will actually have a net positive on the peg counterintuitively. Folks need to stop thinking so straightforward that low SF = more DAI. In theory that makes sense but we have no idea what the motivations of each vault holder are and what drives their decisions. It\u2019s our job to 1) Keep the peg and 2) Ensure that the system doesn\u2019t collapse by insuring it. Right now we\u2019re doing neither. Maybe by doing 2 we can solve 1. ",

This is definitely what is going on, a whale gets a 1M-10M loan without issues, and place it in one of those big pools earning big interest. No DAI in circulation, DAI price continue growing. That said, I would prefer to have an ETH-B Vault with 1% and see how it influences the price before raising further the debt ceiling of ETH-A vault and adding a risk premium. I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019ll be simple to have it ready as easy as voting for changing ETH-A parameters. ",
