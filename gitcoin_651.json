The visualizations and my commentary can be found here:   github.com   ufkhan97/gitcoin_grants_analysis/blob/main/readme.md # 2021 Year-End Gitcoin Grants Trends   Gitcoin grants is an innovative, principled experiment in new ways to fund open source software projects and public goods. It seeks to find new and better ways to crowdfund which rewards projects that appeal to more people rather than to merely rich people. The main driver of this project is a system called 'quadratic funding' which is best explained at [wtfisqf.com](https://wtfisqf.com/)  Quadratic funding seeks to provide projects more funding if they have more unique contributors. In other words: more people, more money.  Gitcoin accomplishes this by having a supply of money called a 'matching fund' for each funding cycle or grant round. Money from this matching fund is paid to grants by Gitcoin proportional to the number of unique contributors of the grant. So far, Gitcoin has been funding projects for 3 years and in that time has had 12 rounds of funding.  ## 20x in 2 years The growth of Gitcoin grants is truly impressive! Since 2019, Gitcoin has 20x'd its impact. 20x in two years.   Let's take a look at the numbers:  ![NumberOfUniqueGrantsByYear](NumberOfUniqueGrantsByYear.png) ![PercentChangeInNumberOfUniqueGrantsComparedToPriorYear](PercentChangeInNumberOfUniqueGrantsComparedToPriorYear.png)  From 2019 to 2020 the number of grants 10x'd. From 2020 to 2021 the number of grants 2x'd. Put together, this is 20x in two years. I am rounding the numbers here to pick out the big trends in the gitcoin grants system. As with any system, there is immense variability if one gets increasingly granular.  This is just the number of grants on the platform, created by users. But what about the amount of **money** that was actually paid out to projects?       This file has been truncated. show original      Please let me know what y\u2019all think! I hope this starts a discussion and am happy to do some follow-up visualizations. Thanks, UmarKhan.Eth ",
