I can imagine some use cases that would use a completely different management system but could still benefit from the resolver interface. For example, 4553.some-nft could always resolve to the owner of Some NFT #4553.  In canPointSubdomain, is the point to prevent yourself being added as a subdomain to a parent you don\u2019t want? If so, what\u2019s to stop a malicious parent just skipping this check? ",

Without it, no resolution is possible. Without a globally accepted root, a name has no meaning. There are no frontrunning mitigations for domain creation.  I\u2019ve seen another alternative to ENS being developed, dmap, which notably does not have an EIP.
