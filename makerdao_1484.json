Apparently the trust will not adjust the fees until they are adjusted on-chain, so Maker is losing revenue by not updating the rate to reflect the agreed-upon terms. This signal requests that the on-chain vault rate reflect the appropriate level, particularly after two substantial rate hikes. Should the 6S vault stability fees be reset to the Prime Rate as published by the Wall Street Journal on August 10, 2022? (August 10th will be the date this signal request is scheduled to close) Note that the credit agreement may or may not allow Maker to adjust the Applicable Rate by a maximum amount, which means it may not be possible to fully \u201ccatch up\u201d the rate in a single raise. Also note that the Applicable Rate at the trust level appears to only update on the 1st of a month, so any executive updating this parameter should keep that in mind. Pros More accurately reflect the fees accruing in the 6S vault Apparently needed to update fess charged at the trust level Marginally more revenue Cons 6S will have a fairly substantial jump in rates since Maker did not raise it as rates rose over the last year    Set 6S Vault Stability Fee to Prime Rate minus 25 bps as published in the WSJ on August 10?

Can you expand on this? It\u2019s not a recommendation. It\u2019s simply updating the parameters to reflect what is in the credit agreement. Maker cannot even fully raise the fees to what 6S agreed upon in the credit agreement. This shouldn\u2019t be viewed as punitive. It\u2019s due to this parameter never being updated, when it should have been adjusted upwards three times already: +25 basis points in March 2022 +50 basis points more in May 2022 +75 basis points more in June 2022 +75 basis points more now Continuing to not raise it to the level in the agreement means Maker risks taking even longer to catch up. As you can see, the fees are already in excess of the maximum the agreement will allow to take effect. ",

I\u2019m under the believe that the 6S deal was structure in the hope that it would scale into the Billions, therefore those terms were proposed. But since I believe 6S has spent more money on innovating via MIP21 and their vault has been pushed to a stagnant phase, it would send a terrible signal to future RWA applicants who want to scale via MakerDAO. Therefore I recommend that this vault should be left as is until the DAO can find a path forward were both MKR token owners and 6S benefit from a mutual relationship. I believe that fundamental business principles are statements that a DAO should also adhere to in order to identify its RWA priorities and guide future decisions. One of those key principles is promoting MakerDAO\u2019s products, services, and it\u2019s strength. The DAO should treat its current and future partners with better business sense. ",

Where and when was notice given to the borrower of the spread change? Either the contract floats off the prime rate and a given spread, or we are updating the spread to maintain an flat rate for the borrower and giving written notice of the spread change to the borrow. IMO we can\u2019t have it both ways. Please let me know if I\u2019m misunderstanding something. Seems like @GFXlabs, @PaperImperium, and I are thinking the same way. ",

                    "content": "The way I see it, there are several key questions here:   Is the 6s / RWA-001 facility a floating or fixed rate instrument?   The original term sheet is quite clear that the pricing is based on a floating component (Wall Street Prime) + a Maker risk adjustment. Notably that risk adjustment is proposed to be a function of the total debt ceiling (representing a rate subsidy vs. prime at smaller debt tonnage).  5105cc75ab408fa5911ca06d0e1152ba18c874401920\u00d72485 209 KB    Somewhere from the term sheet to the finalized CA the structure changed:   \u201cApplicable Rate\u201d means, for any day, a rate per annum (rounded, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the Prime Rate in effect on such day, plus or minus the Spread.  \u201cSpread\u201d means the difference between the interest rate certified by the Verification Agent on a given date and the Prime Rate. Putting these together: \u201cApplicable Rate\u201d means [\u2026] a rate per annum [\u2026] equal to the Prime Rate [\u2026] plus or minus the difference between the interest rate certified by the Verification Agent on a given date and the Prime Rate.     This reads like fixed rate, unless Maker votes on a stability fee change. This is unfortunate because both the original term sheet and the face-value language in the credit agreement suggest a floating rate instrument unless you read very carefully. I guess it depends on whether it\u2019s reasonable to expect Maker holders to read the CAs of every RWA deal?     If it is a fixed rate instrument why has the Lender not provided written notice to update the Spread?  Shouldn\u2019t our Lender be providing written notice to the borrower of spread changes in accordance with the credit agreement? Shouldn\u2019t the arranger (working hopefully on behalf of Maker) be communicating with MKR holders and trying to extract the best possible returns out the debt we have deployed?    ",

I think anyone getting paid by the protocol to issue recommendations about RWA facilities should have read the credit agreement, especially considering that it\u2019s one of a handful of live facilities and the final documentation has been available for a very long time. Ironically, 6s wanted the rate to be attached to prime (hence the borrower-proposed term sheet) and it was MKR-holder feedback at the time that caused it to be changed. Their logic was that they may need to raise the rate over prime, so we shouldn\u2019t box ourselves in. So I think they did read this specific credit agreement, for whatever it\u2019s worth.     pipko:  Shouldn\u2019t our Lender be providing written notice to the borrower of spread changes in accordance with the credit agreement?   Once again I believe you are misinterpreting. The \u201cSpread\u201d is a variable in the agreement that has been set to a formula. The Spread from an economic perspective is variable, the Spread in the legal agreement is referring to the formula. No one is going to provide written notice unless Maker changes the formula. There\u2019s really no point in arguing this because this is obviously how the Trustee and Trust Sponsor have interpreted it thus far. If you want to change it to be that they\u2019ll write 6s every time the spread changes (which happens automatically anyway), that\u2019s an easy thing to do.     pipko:  Shouldn\u2019t the arranger (working hopefully on behalf of Maker) be communicating with MKR holders and trying to extract the best possible returns out the debt we have deployed?   For one, what exactly is an arranger? I\u2019ve only seen this term used as a meme and not in a practical definition. Two, who is the arranger in this context? Three, if there\u2019s any misconception that RWA Co. is an arranger, let me correct that now by clarifying that we are not. Our role in the 6s facility is monthly reporting to the DAO, nothing more or less. ",
