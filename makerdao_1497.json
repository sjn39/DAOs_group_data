MIP79: Recognized Delegate MKR Compensation.  It is recommended that all three MIPs are read to understand the totality of the changes being proposed.  Sentence Summary MIP78 defines the Maker Protocol\u2019s process to award DAI compensation to Recognized Delegates.  Paragraph Summary MIP78 defines the Maker Protocol\u2019s process to award DAI compensation to Recognized Delegates. Governance Facilitators will compute and send the compensation to Recognized Delegates starting from the MIP ratification date, with quarterly payments. These payments will be made in dedicated Executive Votes.  Component Summary MIP78c1: Definitions MIP78c1 defines key terms. MIP78c2: Compensation Formula and Initial Parameters MIP78c2 defines the formula for calculating Recognized Delegate DAI compensation. MIP78c3: Initial Parameters MIP78c3 defines the initial parameters that will be applied if this MIP is ratified. MIP78c4: Compensation Process and Distribution MIP78c4 describes the process for executing payments to Recognized Delegates. MIP78c5: Accommodation for Delegate Contract Migration MIP78c5 outlines how the process of Recognized Delegate DAI compensation will change during the contract migration period. MIP78c6: Modification of Parameters MIP78c6 is a process component describing changes to the DAI compensation parameters for Recognized Delegates.  Motivation Why should we pay Recognized Delegates? The Maker Protocol compensates Recognized Delegates to incentivize their participation in the system. In return, the Maker Protocol receives a group of individuals incentivized to study proposals and cast votes while also communicating their voting decisions. This serves a dual purpose for the Protocol:  It promotes the security of the Maker Protocol by incentivizing consistent support of the hat. If more MKR is securing the hat, the Maker Protocol is more secure. It promotes a feedback loop when Recognized Delegates are incentivized to provide the reasoning for their votes. This not only encourages and stimulates discussion and debate, which can lead to more robust proposals as a result, but it also provides proposal-authors with actionable feedback, potentially allowing them to amend a failed proposal so that it takes on an acceptable form.  Vote outcomes are primarily determined by how well voters are informed. As Recognized Delegates hold a great deal of voting weight, MKR holders are strongly motivated to encourage Recognized Delegates to be as informed as possible and deliberate on Governance questions in depth. Recognized Delegates should be encouraged to discuss proposals with all stakeholders to gain the broadest possible perspective on the questions presented before them to decide. Compensation will help free Recognized Delegates from some of their other responsibilities. For outstanding Recognized Delegates, a secondary goal of compensation is to retain talent and prevent poaching by competing protocols or businesses. Why do metrics need to be taken into account for compensation? Recognized Delegate DAI compensation is based on the Recognized Delegate Metrics defined in MIP77c5. Participation in on-chain voting is one of the most crucial aspects of the Recognized Delegate role. Through this process, they can manifest the voting power that has been entrusted to them by MKR holders. By communicating the reasoning behind their voting decisions, Recognized Delegates allow delegators and prospective delegators to observe their thought processes. Assume Recognized Delegates were compensated purely based on the amount of MKR delegated. In this scenario, without any form of qualification for compensation, any MKR holder could deploy a delegate contract and farm DAI from the Maker Protocol for minimal effort. Similarly, if only participation is measured, a Recognized Delegate could simply vote \u201cAbstain\u201d or \u201cOption 1\u201d on all polls and receive compensation. Requiring communication and reasoning behind voting decisions removes incentives for Recognized Delegates who want to farm DAI for minimal effort, as well as producing social pressure to display cogent reasoning behind votes. What goals form the basis of this compensation system?  Recognized Delegate DAI compensation should be positively correlated with MKR weight. The compensation formula should discourage zero-sum thinking among Recognized Delegates. One Recognized Delegate\u2019s compensation should be as independent as possible from another Recognized Delegate\u2019s compensation. This would not be achievable with a shared pool system. Compensation should be positively skewed toward Recognized Delegates with smaller MKR weight to encourage recruitment of new Recognized Delegates, allowing them to be bootstrapped into the system. There should be a cap on the maximum DAI compensation per delegate to prevent excessive compensation from being paid to Recognized Delegates. This threshold should be high enough to incentivize Recognized Delegates to actively seek out MKR holders to delegate to them, rather than relying on attracting a moderate amount of delegated MKR. The cap may also be important for MKR delegators who wish to delegate but do not want to increase the total Recognized Delegate compensation. If delegating always increases the total Recognized Delegate compensation, then potential delegators might hesitate to delegate. Recognized Delegates who can attract large amounts of delegated MKR should receive enough compensation that they have the option to hire an assistant(s). This will allow them to keep abreast of Governance Proposals in the Maker Protocol, which is critical given that they have the highest MKR voting weight. The system should allow for and appropriately compensate Recognized Delegates acting as part of a team or group, and not just be geared toward single individuals. There should be an overall cap on the amount of DAI that can be paid out to Recognized Delegates to protect the DAO and MKR holders from excessive expense.  Why a new MIP, rather than amending MIP61? This MIP Set splits the content of MIP61 between two separate MIPs, includes marked changes to the amounts of compensation available for Recognized Delegates, and switches the metric period for calculating compensation from lifetime to a rolling three-month basis. It switches the payment cadence from monthly to quarterly and introduces a provision for paying Recognized Delegate DAI compensation in dedicated Executive Votes. These significant changes make a new MIP more appropriate than an amendment, and consequently, the passage of this MIP set will make MIP61 obsolete.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP78c1: Definitions   Recognized Delegate: Any delegate that meets the requirements defined in MIP77c2.  Max Compensated MKR (MKRMAX): The maximum amount of delegated MKR for which a Recognized Delegate will be compensated. MKR delegated above this amount will not increase DAI compensation.  Concentration (C): The concentration of compensation towards larger Recognized Delegates.  Max Compensation (DAIMAX): The maximum amount of DAI compensation which a Recognized Delegate can receive for a given month.  Minimum Performance Threshold (PERFMIN): The theshold of performance below which Recognized Delegates are not at all compensated.  Good Performance Threshold (PERFGOOD): The theshold of performance below which Recognized Delegates are not fully compensated.  Minimum Performance Multiplier (PERFMULT): The minimum multiplier that applies to Recognized Delegates when they drop below the good performance threshold.  Delegated MKR (MKRDEL): The amount of MKR delegated to the Recognized Delegate.  Max Total Payout (TOTALMAX): The maximum amount of total DAI that will be paid out to Recognized Delegates by the Maker Protocol in a month.  Payout Reduction (DAICUT): The reduction to Recognized Delegate pay that is applied in a month if TOTALMAX is exceeded.  Monthly DAI (DAICOMP): The amount of monthly DAI compensation for a Recognized Delegate.   MIP78c2: Compensation Formula  Calculations To calculate how much MKR was delegated to a Recognized Delegate over a month, a daily snapshot of MKR delegated to each Recognized Delegate will be taken. Then, the Governance Facilitators will take the mean average for each Recognized Delegate over the month. MKR values above the Max Compensated MKR (MKRMAX) will not be included in this calculation. The performance thresholds listed refer to the Recognized Delegate metrics defined in MIP77c5. The metrics used for calculating Recognized Delegate compensation reference the most recent three-month period, and the lower of the two metrics over this period is used. So, if over the last three months a Recognized Delegate has a Participation metric of 80% and a Communication metric of 90%, 80% will be the value used. A Performance Multiplier is applied to Recognized Delegate\u2019s DAI compensation. The following principles are used based on their lowest metric:  For less than PERFMIN, the Performance Multiplier will be 0. No compensation will be forthcoming. For greater than or equal to PERFMIN, the Performance Modifier starts at PERFMULT and rises linearly to 100% for metrics of PERFGOOD and above.  This is demonstrated in the following graph:  The following formula calculates a Recognized Delegate\u2019s entitlement to compensation. DAI_{COMP} = DAI_{MAX}*min(1, {(MKR_{DEL})^C \\over (MKR_{MAX})^C}) * PerformanceMultiplier  Maximum Total Payout It the sum of DAICOMP for all Recognized Delegates exceeds the Max Total Payout (TOTALMAX) parameter, then the Payout Reduction (DAICUT) multiplier will be applied at a flat-rate across all Recognized Delegates. The formula to calculate DAICUT is as follows: DAI_{CUT} = 1-(\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}DAI_{COMP} - TOTAL_{MAX}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}DAI_{COMP}}) An individual Recognized Delegate\u2019s compensation will then be calculated as: DAI_{COMP} = DAI_{MAX}*min(1, {(MKR_{DEL})^C \\over (MKR_{MAX})^C}) * Performance Multiplier * DAI_{CUT} If the monthly payments to Recognized Delegates are approaching or exceeding the Max Total Payout this should be considered by the Community as a trigger to re-assess the parameters for Recognized Delegate DAI compensation. Example  TOTAL_{MAX} = 1,000,000 \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} DAI_{COMP} = 1,100,000 DAI_{CUT} = 1 - (100,000/1,100,000) = 0.91  Therefore, all Recognized Delegates\u2019 compensation would be multiplied by 0.91 - a 9% reduction.  MIP78c3: Initial Parameters The following are the parameters that will be instituted if this MIP is ratified:   Max Compensated MKR (MKRMAX): 30,000 MKR.  Concentration (C): 0.6  Max Compensation (DAIMAX): 25,000 DAI.  Minimum Performance Threshold (PERFMIN): 75%.  Good Performance Threshold (PERFGOOD): 90%.  Minimum Performance Multiplier (PERFMULT): 40%.  Max Total Payout (TOTALMAX): 250,000 DAI per month (3 million DAI annualized).   Effects Compared to MIP61 These parameter changes have the following effects compared to the parameters in MIP61:  Max Compensation has been raised from 12,000 to 25,000 DAI. Annualized, this is an increase from 144,000 to 300,000 DAI. However, it has become harder to reach the maximum value, as Max Compensated MKR has increased to 30,000 MKR, compared to 10,000 MKR under MIP61. The skew to more minor Recognized Delegates remains but has been made smaller by changing the Concentration from 0.5 to 0.6. The inflection point where a Recognized Delegate earns more under MIP78 compared to MIP61 is 4,733 delegated MKR.  The changes can be seen in the following graph:  1135\u00d7631 24.3 KB  The following table demonstrates the changes in compensation amounts that a group of hypothetical Recognized Delegates would experience between the two MIPs. For simplicity, assume that all Recognized Delegates in this example have both metrics above 90%:     Delegates MKR Delegated MIP61 Monthly Comp (DAI) MIP78 Monthly Comp (DAI) Change (DAI) MIP61 DAI per MKR Delegated MIP78 DAI per MKR Delegated     Delegate 1 30,000 12,000 25,000 13,000 0.40 0.83   Delegate 2 25,000 12,000 22,409 10,409 0.48 0.90   Delegate 3 20,000 12,000 19,601 7,601 0.60 0.98   Delegate 4 15,000 12,000 16,494 4,494 0.80 1.10   Delegate 5 10,000 12,000 12,932 932 1.20 1.29   Delegate 6 5,000 8,485 8,532 47 1.70 1.71   Delegate 7 3,000 6,573 6,280 -293 2.19 2.09   Delegate 8 1,000 3,795 3,248 -547 3.80 3.25   Delegate 9 750 3,286 2,733 -553 4.38 3.64   Delegate 10 500 2,683 2,143 -540 5.37 4.29   Delegate 11 250 1,897 1,414 -483 7.59 5.66   Delegate 12 100 1,200 816 -384 12 8.16   Delegate 13 10 379 205 -174 37.9 20.50     MIP78c4: Compensation Process and Distribution The Governance Facilitators are responsible for calculating Recognized Delegate compensation every month. Once calculated, the Governance Facilitators will publish a summary of the compensation for the Recognized Delegates on the MakerDAO forum. Compensation for Recognized Delegates will be distributed by Executive Vote. These Executive Votes will take place quarterly, in January, April, July, and October. Executive Votes containing Recognized Delegate DAI compensation are not permitted to include any other changes to the Maker Protocol. This is to prevent a conflict of interest where Recognized Delegates are incentivized to support an Executive Vote they would otherwise have opposed. An exception is setting up MKR Vesting streams to Recognized Delegates as defined in MIP79: Recognized Delegate MKR Compensation, which may be bundled with Recognized Delegate DAI compensation. As with any other distribution of funds through the Executive Vote process, Recognized Delegates should confirm the amount of compensation being paid and the receiving address with the Governance Facilitators in the week leading up to the Executive Vote. If a Recognized Delegate cannot do this, that Recognized Delegate\u2019s compensation will not be included in the next Executive Vote and instead will be included in a future Executive Vote at a mutually agreeable time. These catch-up payments may be bundled with other proposals.  MIP78c5: Accommodation for Delegate Contract Migration When a Recognized Delegate intends to migrate from one delegate contract to another the following points should be considered:  The associated entity should inform the Community the effective migration date no fewer than seven days before and which contracts are affected. The new delegate contract cannot already be involved in a migration (e.g., two delegates merging into one). During a 30-day interim period, the old and new delegate contracts are regarded for compensation as referring to the same entity. Compensation is calculated using stats from the old and new contracts. For example, MKR weight will be obtained by the sum of the MKR weight of the old and new contracts. Participation and communication stats will be calculated across both delegate contracts.   MIP78c6: Modification of Compensation Parameters The parameters that Maker Governance can modify are:   Max Compensated MKR (MKRMAX): The maximum amount of delegated MKR for which a Recognized Delegate will be compensated. MKR delegated above this amount will not increase DAI compensation.  Concentration (C): The concentration of compensation towards larger Recognized Delegates.  Max Compensation (DAIMAX): The maximum amount of DAI compensation which a Recognized Delegate can recieve for a given month.  Minimum Performance Threshold (PERFMIN): The theshold of permformance below which Recognized Delegates are not at all compensated.  Good Performance Threshold (PERFGOOD): The theshold of performance below which Recognized Delegates are not fully compensated.  Minimum Performance Multiplier (PERFMULT): The minimum multiplier that applies to Recognized Delegates when they drop below the good performance threshold.  Max Total Payout (TOTALMAX): The maximum amount of total DAI that will be paid out to Recognized Delegates by the Maker Protocol in a month.  Payout Reduction (DAICUT): The reduction to Recognized Delegate pay that is applied in a month if TOTALMAX is exceeded.  Recognized Delegates are potentially conflicted in consideration of these proposals. For example, there may be a temptation to approve increases in compensation and vote against decreases. Hence, a Signal Request is required to assess broader Community sentiment and spotlight any positions on the MIP78c6 subproposal staked out by Recognized Delegates. The Signal Request Poll must be posted at the start of the Frozen Period. The Governance Facilitators will aim to perform a review of the above parameters on an annual basis. This will provide an objective assessment of these parameters and consider changes in the amounts of MKR delegated, the number of active Recognized Delegates, and USD inflation to ensure that Recognized Delegates remain fairly compensated whilst also providing good value for MKR holders. MIP78c6 subproposals have the following parameters:   Requirements: 7-day Signal Request Thread, passing with >50% of non-abstain votes. If the Signal Request fails, the proposal does not proceed to the Governance Cycle.  Default Feedback Period: 4 weeks  Frozen Period: 1 week  Governance Cycle: Monthly  ",

The proposed system has a centralization spiral: Bigger delegates get compensated so well that they can outmaneuver smaller delegates, who\u2019ll fall further behind in recognition and delegation as a result. Otoh, great delegates should be compensated, and the current level of complexity is such that two persons would be much better suited to cover the whole ground than one. In view of the Endgame Plan and SimpleDAI core, this might become less of an issue but hard to judge from where we are today. Personally, I\u2019d like to see DAI compensation ceilings to be lower and MKR vests higher with a longer duration till maturity and or an issuance schedule over a couple of years. Ideally, the system attracts delegates who are in it for the long run. But I almost feel like delegates shouldn\u2019t be able to vote on this (only half joking). We\u2019re discussing this proposal internally and will come back with more questions and suggestions as soon as possible. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the comments so far.     MakerMan:  The issue here is that this is going to further concentrate delegate power because those who get the most MKR delegated will end up with the highest compensation.   I suspect this is largely unavoidable. The compensation system is positively correlated with MKR delegated (at least up to the cap) because this is how we can infer the value delegators have placed on a Recognized Delegate. Although, it is still balanced in favour of smaller RDs.     MakerMan:  Not clear to me that this compensation model includes different levels of work/responsibility. Like I don\u2019t see any difference between what is expected from a delegate with 3K MKR and one that has 30K MKR and I would hazard there should be.   That is a good observation. From the MIPs\u2019 perspectives, there isn\u2019t a difference between these two hypothetical RDs. However, from the MKR holder perspective, for an RD to be \u201cworth\u201d 30k MKR delegated it\u2019s logical to think they are offering better value/performance in the eyes of their delegators than the delegate with 3k MKR.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Regardless, I think this is motivation to aim for higher delegation from MKR token owners.   This is one of the principle motivations here. At present, a single large delegator can maintain multiple delegates at the maximum amount for compensation. That becomes much harder with the new parameters and encourages RDs to diversify the source of their MKR.     Doo_StableLab:  what would be the additional cost compared to the current system?   Great question. If we assume for the sake of comparison that a) all delegates reset their metrics and maintain good metrics for the entire year and b) MKR that was in contracts that expired eventually finds it\u2019s way back to the same delegate and c) delegation remains static; comparison is as follows:  image874\u00d7480 19.6 KB  So an increase of ~ 143,500k DAI per year ceteris paribus. In reality the number will be different with MakerMan stepping down and I think it extremely unlikely that we won\u2019t see changes in delegation amounts. For clarity, the point below which RDs earn less DAI under MIP78 is ~4,700 MKR, but they now have MKR comp added into the equation. I\u2019ve made a sheet here where you can try out different parameters to see how they effect comp: PUBLIC Delegate Comp Parameter Sandbox - Google Sheets     rspa:  I\u2019d like to see DAI compensation ceilings to be lower   What number do you have in mind?

Enough to pay 2 - 2,5 people at somewhat reasonable rates means 20,000 - 25,000 DAI/month upper ceiling. Personally leaning closer to 20,000. But: Increase MKR vesting and add a cliff. Currently set at yearly pay buying MKR at market rate. Maybe 1,5x that but vesting over two or even three years. MKR could be bought by MakerDAO on a monthly basis, which would be a small kind of burn and DCA the cost. If a delegate fails to qualify, these MKR are available for CU vests or can be kept for other delegates. I\u2019d love to see strong incentives for long-term behavior and fewer incentives for value extraction. That being said: I have a massive conflict of interest here. We love to get paid for work here, and I think it is necessary to pay delegates if a DAO wants to attract good talent. I also think the current pay is good, we\u2019re happy with what we have and have been engaging even when we were not getting paid. But the current system has some flaws, which you also pointed out in the MIPs, mainly that delegates are not incentivized to attract more than 12000 MKR atm and that more pay could allow delegates to bring more talent to bear on decisions.

The absurdity. | by Raphael Spannocchi | Flipside Governance | Aug, 2022 | Medium    Thanks @rspa, this was a good read. On this point:  But if delegates do not get paid, DAOs are at the mercy of delegates donating time. Depending on their financial situation, delegates have to prioritize paid work, even during emergencies. Enthusiasts, true fans, and wealthy idealists are the only ones who\u2019ll stick to an unpaid role. Or malicious actors who fake it, until they can execute a governance attack.  I agree and in some ways, the most likely issue with not sufficiently paying delegates is the resulting transfer of power to the \u2018wealthy idealists\u2019. Being an enthusiast is fine, but we have a problem if delegates were ideologues. The truth is that being a delegate (at least at Maker) is a tough job with a high learning curve, and the need to synthesise a lot of data and concepts in order to cast well-informed votes on a variety of different issues. That\u2019s quite a specific and demanding skillset, one which a collection of passionate ideologues seems unlikely to deliver. ",

One of the recent criticism is that as more delegates join and get more delegated,   Great question. As Josh pointed out we hope that the new cap introduced in this proposal would prevent unlimited spending. The guys at SF did produce a model that would look at the number of delegates and total MKR delegated to calculate pay (as well as some other inputs), ultimately GovAlpha decided against proposing that model because it introduced a large degree of complexity. We value the predictability of our model where if you are delegated X MKR you know you will be paid Y DAI (assuming the cap hasn\u2019t been met) as this makes it easier to explain to prospective Recognized Delegates.

There would be an increase of ~143k DAI/year if we introduced the new parameters and the delegated amounts of MKR remain the same as they were at the time of that calculation (i.e. no MKR in, no MKR out). The cap was set to 3 million DAI per year initially, but I am potentially going to change this - see below.     rspa:  Increase MKR vesting and add a cliff.   There is a cliff of 12 months in the MIP79 proposal, but I am going to suggest some changes where Recognized Delegates can opt for a longer cliff and get a higher multiplier - therefore improving their long-term alignment with their delegators.     Federact:  Will/Should recognized delegates be allowed to vote on this poll?   They will be allowed to vote. Voting is permissionless; we cannot stop them even if we wanted to. Some of them may choose to abstain due to a conflict of interest. Ultimately, their delegators are the arbiters of whether any conflict of interest has affected decision-making, if they think it has, they are free to undelegate their tokens.     rspa:  Let me know what you think.   I enjoyed this article. Thank you for posting it.     Doo_StableLab:  I am planning to vote against it once it\u2019s onchain as right now is premature.   Thank you for the clear feedback Doo. Is there a compromise you would be willing to support? We have had feedback from some people that they think the parameters are reasonable, but we have also had feedback that the maximum amount is too high. We (Payton and I) have discussed this internally and would like to offer up the following parameters as a compromise that we think still incentivizes Recognized Delegates to attract more MKR to their platform:  Max Compensation (DAIMAX) : 16,500 DAI (max. annual 198,000 DAI) Concentration (C) : 0.6 Max Compensated MKR (MKRMAX): 20,000 MKR Max Total Payout (TOTALMAX): 200,000 DAI per month (2.4 million DAI annualized).  At the same time, we would also consider reducing the relative amount of MKR a Recognized Delegate receives from a value of X (where X is the amount of DAI received) streamed over 12 months to 0.75X worth of MKR over 12 months, but with an option to stream over 24 months, in which case a Recognized Delegate would receive X DAI worth of MKR. Using the same numbers as the previous example I posted, this would lead to the following comp levels for the current delegates, again assuming they all reset their metrics and MKR delegated remains constant:  image1037\u00d7485 21.6 KB  As you can see, on an annualized basis, these parameters would save Maker ~125,000 DAI annualized compared to MIP61 (although there would be additional MKR costs). With these figures, the crossover point where a Recognized Delegate would earn more under the new system would be 11,764 delegated MKR. What do you and others think of these alternative parameters?

Its ok to vote \u201cabstain\u201d and to provide a rationale as to why you cant support or oppose its current form.   I completely understand where this is coming from, as nobody wants delegates who just click \u2018abstain\u2019 every vote and then collect their compensation every month. That\u2019s in part why I support the tracking of delegate vote communication by GovAlpha as a reasonable metric for helping determine compensation - it helps MKR holders work out the reasoning behind each vote to abstain. On the other hand, I think it\u2019s really important that the incentive structures in Maker governance do not penalise abstentions, up to and including situations where a delegate has a lack of knowledge. The issue with penalising delegates who vote \u2018abstain\u2019 due to a lack of knowledge is that they will just start voting \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 instead, to avoid whatever the penalty is. Then we have an unfortunate situation where delegates will not admit when they do not understand the context or detail behind a vote - they will just vote one way or the other to avoid the penalty. That surely leads to worse governance decisions, and we wouldn\u2019t even know the extent to which delegates are covering up a lack of knowledge. So on balance, I don\u2019t think penalising abstentions of any kind would be wise.     park:  In light of the volume and complexity of proposals passing through the governance portal, has there been any consideration for ways to optimise for decision quality rather than simply the number of votes?   +1 to this as a critical \u2018north star\u2019 for Maker to work towards (ie, optimising the quality of decisions made). However, I agree with @Doo_StableLab that it\u2019s a tricky problem that involves a lot of subjectivity, making it hard to build a functional set of incentives as opposed to something that could be gamed. I think there are other ways to improve decision quality at Maker (like shifting the taxonomy of things voted on) that are easier to achieve and less subjective compared to delegate metrics. ",

Completely agree, especially acknowledging that jack-of-all-trades governance for something as complex as MakerDAO is not how we win going forward. Abstain for lack of knowledge also could make sense where the volume of proposals, other demands on time (for the DAO or otherwise) means a Delegate did not have the capacity to become educated enough about a particular vote. The myriad of expertise and level of detail, context & due diligence really required for governing MakerDAO well suggests we need to either (1) limit the matters that come before Delegate/MKR holders for vote OR (2) we need a management layer (can be decentralized!) that can digest and consolidate information for presentation to the Delegates with recommendations. These contributors can spend the time to be deeply informed and answer questions/find the answers (rather than our current dependence on the interested parties/proposers to produce this information).

Ideally, we would have delegates serve on their known/presumed expertise more actively and then hire staff or join other focus areas to gain more expertise/breadth on their platform.
