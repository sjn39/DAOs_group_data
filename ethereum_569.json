I will likely start a new thread when all details are finalized.  Original Post I\u2019m currently helping plan ETH Denver Content with the exceptional team. There\u2019s a fast approaching deadline of content scheduling happening on December 11th. I would love to see some magicians attend and speak as well as form gatherings to discuss topics and rings in and around ETH Denver and BUIDL Week Colorado. Please apply here and tag yourself in the description as a magician to have your application flagged for priority review by the team. https://ethdenver.taigamarket.io/apply Also feel free to expand on this topic with any suggestions for content you\u2019d like to see. It\u2019s still early so there is room for improvement of the schedule but the team is eager to nail this down fast. ",
