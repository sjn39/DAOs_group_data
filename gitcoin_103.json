This week we are about ~87% complete with our MVP Goal, with about ~83% of our timeline complete. We also have made significant progress on the reader implementation into Trust Bonus. Grants Hub targets to be dev and testing-complete with Grants Hub minimum viable product by Friday, June 3rd. With this week\u2019s progress, they are about ~30% of the way to hitting that milestone. Their goal is to have Grants Hub production-ready by July 1st, 2022, in time for the GR14 claims period, where we will prompt grants owners to migrate their grants from cGrants to Grants Hub. The Round Manager / Grant Explorer team hopes to run ~3 alpha rounds on their minimum viable product before November. That should enable us to run at least one of the end-to-end GR16 ecosystem rounds on the new protocol. The goal for GR17 is to run all rounds on the protocol. The team aims to scope out the minimum viable product by next week.   Product Work  dPopp Project  Paired w/ engineering to remove the logjam in backlog, knocking out a lot of Acceptance Criteria Planned dPopp Project branding w/ GR14 (launching alpha - for Gitcoin use only) Worked on the path to prod details and any launch plans  Created checklist for prod and determined URL location/domain to use for GR14 Started planning support strategy for GR14   Researched BrightID & Idena integrations  Finish support strategy for GR14 and communicate plans  Coordinate with Gitcoin support team on support details Establish on-call plans for engineering & product support   Lots of product walkthroughs to test UX and clean up small interactions Research usage numbers of previous rounds for better traffic expectations for GR14   Grants Hub  Completed v2 product requirements document with updated phases and timelines available.  Start research for Round Operators (i.e., if grant owner details are needed, et cetera.)  Finalize Round Manager <> Grant Hub flow interaction (applying to a round, tracking grant status, et cerera.)   Round Manager / Explorer  The Round Manager team has partnered with GPC leadership and the Grant Hub team over the past two weeks to officially kick off the Round Manager work and scope the MVP. Given OOO and time zone differences, we\u2019ve been able to have five synchronous sessions of 2-4 hours each. In that time, we\u2019ve reviewed/aligned on the Genesis Brief, documented initial risks, and mapped about 90% of the Round Manager journey, including:  Creating a program and adding team members Configuring a round and deploying it Applying to a round (though this will live in Grant Hub) Reviewing and approving grants Starting, operating, and closing a grants round Note: we decided the round payout process requires more product discovery (see goals below)   Find out more:  Genesis brief Kickoff Miro board Kickoff meeting notes   Map user journey for Grant Explorer Align on the timeline for Round Manager / Grant Explorer Minimum Viable Product Steel thread stories for Round Manager Discovery of KYC/payout requirements   Design Work  dPopp Project  Worked on micro-interactions for a hi-fidelity end-to-end prototype Further work on micro-interactions and small cleanup details Finalize minimum viable product of verifiable credential flow designs in the prototype and Figma doc clean up ready for dev   Grants Hub  Produced high-fidelity mocks for Grant Hub.  Start designs for GR14 Claims flow (prompt users to migrate their grants from cGrants to Grant Hub) Start designs for \u201capplying to a round\u201d and \u201ctracking grant status\u201d via Grant Hub.   Round Manager / Explorer Draft user flows/wireframes for Round Manager  Engineering Work  dPopp Project  Began verifiable credentials: POAP and Facebook Completed several variable credentials: ENS, PoH, Twitter, Facebook Started work on new tracks: Grants & Interface  Created dPopp-reader repo enabling content pull of a passport based on the wallet address Styled verifiable credential interfaces, including updating tests to account for the style changes   Deployed ceramic node on staging Finish verifiable credentials for GR14: POAP and BrightID Finish planning task list for prod readiness details Continue work on Ceramic Mainnet Network, including coordination with Ceramic team to allow listing Complete Grants work - reader implemented into Trust Bonus Monitor and stress test nodes   Grants Hub  Built out \u201cedit project\u201d functionality Made progress on UI \u2014 improved layout of Grants Hub Continue working on UI to match hi-fidelity designs.  Continue research on Grant Hub storage options (IPFS, Ceramic, et cetera.)   Round Manager / Explorer  The engineering team has worked on setting up the technical environments for our team development, mainly mirroring the Grant Hub setup. Relevant links:  Github team Github Project Github Repo   Steel thread development for Round Manager Continue environment setup   Marketing and Communications  The dPopp Project continued work on its branding: \u201cThe dPopp Project is an identity verification application. It provides a secure, flexible & plural container for an individual\u2019s verifiable credentials. Digital applications (such as Gitcoin Grants) adopt the dPopp Project to verify unique personhood and memberships and increase plurality.\u201d At a meetup organized by Ethereum Foundation in Berlin on May 25th, @kevin.olsen and I will give a presentation about the evolution of Gitcoin Grants and how Grants 2.0 can scale up plural capital provision: Ethereum Meetup - May 2022 , Wed, May 25, 2022, 7:00 PM | Meetup   ",

While we\u2019re on course to complete, ideally, we would have spent about 1-2 weeks sooner to give us plenty of time to test everything. Next week, we will evaluate our product, processes, support, et cetera, to make sure it\u2019s ready to run on GR14. I\u2019ll be asking people to jump in, create Passports, connect them to their profile on Gitcoin, and give feedback. On Wed (June 1st), we\u2019ll decide whether we\u2019re confident about running Passport for GR14. So far, things look good, but there are very tight timeframes here.

Grants 2.0 is an open-source technology for pluralistic and scalable public goods provision. We are building a modular toolkit for Quadratic Funding and adjacent social incentive designs that enables decentralized, self-organizing ecosystems to increase and govern their capital.

Momentum is growing substantially. Grants Hub, the grantee project registry, aims to be production-ready by July 1st when we\u2019ll prompt projects in Gitcoin Grants to migrate over. The team kicked off work on the Round Manager. This Quadratic Funding module will connect contributors, grantees, and matching funders.   Product Work  dPopp Project  Planned for dPopp to cGrants integration. Separated work into tracks to scale efforts: verifiable credentials, grants, reader, and interface. Added all stories needed for MVP in the backlog. Added weekly updates and dPopp to cGrants product requirements document. Further research on BrightID and Idena. Finish details on dPopp to cGrants integration. Increase coordination on branding. Prioritize MVP & GR14 deadlines.   Grants Hub  Improved Grant Hub documentation flow. Notion page now hosts hub v1 PRD and weekly team updates. Github Project now includes new requirements from Round Manager kickoff and updated timelines. Get v2 of Grant Hub PRD ready with updated MVP use cases and short-term + long-term roadmap.  Tag team with Eduardo and Nate on user research and testing for Round Manager and the \u201cApply to a Round\u201d flow: Start sourcing partners and questions to ask partners.   Design Work  dPopp Project  Reviewed mockups for MVP UI changes. Created mockups for dPopp to cGrants.  Finish adding micro-interactions: The goal is to create a high-fidelity end-to-end prototype for testing.   Grants Hub  Updated user flows & wireframes with changes from Round Manager kickoff Kicked off user interviews this week. Start testing mid to high-fidelity prototypes with users for Grant Hub & Round Manager.   Engineering Work  dPopp Project  Completed migration of credential storage to ceramic from local storage Worked on build issues w/ dPopp app & reader app, (due to monorepo & shared dependencies). Made progress on ENS, PoH, and Twitter stamps. Built v1 of the Reader, completing a single slice of end-to-end.  Split the monorepo to reduce build issues (also makes codebase easier to fork)  Start work on new tracks: Grants and Interface.  Reduce tech debt: Add Ceramic integration tests into the CI pipeline and improve application unit tests.   Grants Hub  Steel thread proof of concept is demo ready \u2014 included login, create and view a grant, and publish a grant (edit a grant is WIP). Add edit-a-grant functionality. Lint the code base and remove any existing error. Get the front end code coverage up & the UI looking good. Start technical documentation.   Marketing and Communications Organized a dPopp Project branding/naming workshop with @seanmac and @seedphrase and various product stakeholders. ",

In terms of MVP, completing the last stamp (BrightID) marked the completion of MVP. Additionally, we have code up for a Reader on @trust | Gitcoin to give users a Trust Bonus Score. Does it feel done - like we\u2019ve crossed some sort of line? No, not at all. The feedback we\u2019ve been gathering has provided us plenty of UI/UX improvements. It\u2019s helped us validate our assumptions on some problems, and invalidate what we thought were problems elsewhere. It\u2019s helped us discover more about the value we\u2019re providing to our users, and how we can provide more. Grants Hub is targeting to be dev-complete with Grant Hub MVP by Friday, June 3rd. With this week\u2019s progress, we are about 90% of the way to hitting our MVP milestone. Our goal is to have Grants Hub production-ready by July 1st, 2022. This week the Round Manager / Explorer team finished fleshing out the contract structure and tested deploying it to Goerli using some helper scripts we\u2019ve written. We also created a basic UI shell for the Round Manager Steel Thread \u2014 this currently allows you to connect a wallet, but next week we will begin wiring the contracts up and adding more functionality to the UI.

Relevant Documents  Gitcoin Grants 2.0 Vision   Quadratic Funding paper  Decentralized Society paper Demos   Passport: This week\u2019s demo is a bit different. In the spirit of transparency - we decided it would be more valuable to take a minute and talk about the current ceramic node issues we\u2019re seeing. There\u2019s a lot more the teams are learning - and we will certainly know more by the time I update this post later (if there\u2019s not already progress between now and when we recorded) Grants Hub This week Round Manager walks through the functionality of creating a basic program and associated round via our Steel Thread UI. You can connect your wallet (on Goerli) and try it for yourself here: https://rmgitcoin.on.fleek.co/      2022/6/14 Update by @brent (Passport), @michelle_ma (Grants Hub), and @nategosselin (Round Manager)  Highlights  Last week came with both the highs and lows. To kick things off, the Passport had a great first day - breaking 1000 Passports submitted to Grants in the first 24 hours and with minimal issues. Day 2 came, and our ceramic infrastructure started to feel the weight of all the traffic. Part of the pains of launching an \u201cAlpha\u201d Product like this is learning as you go, and this week had no shortage of learning. This week will be spent still stabilizing our ceramic infrastructure while preparing for a hackathon Last week, Grants Hub was 100% dev-complete with the Grant Hub Phase 1 (MVP). We will spend the next 2-3 weeks getting Grant Hub production-ready (deadline 7/1) and kick off Grant Hub Phase 2 (Anchor) this upcoming Monday, 6/13. The Round Manager now has milestones and a demo! The team spent some time this week breaking down the planned goals for Round Manager, turning them into actionable chunks, and aligning on our overall MVP scope/timeline. Our goal is to be code complete with our MVP by 7/5/22. With this week\u2019s progress, we have completed about 85% of our Steel Thread and are about 20% of the way towards hitting our MVP milestone. The team\u2019s ongoing debate was whether we needed a \u201cprogram\u201d shell for MVP and whether that program should be saved on-chain (vs. housed in a centralized database). While there were some UX benefits to housing program metadata (such as operator wallets) in a centralized store, we felt that the overall benefits of pursuing a decentralized program store were much greater and have decided to pursue that route.   Product Work  Passport  More BrightID UX research/strategy Added a bug column and created story\u2019s for improvements Launch communications (also we launched ) Studied user behavior and feedback Explored solutions for user experience Lots of monitoring (support and data) Heavy backlog work to prioritize both SDK work and Ceramic issues Increased pairing time for Brent & Leon (for learning) Dig into the support channel to expose UX failures Explore more solutions for UX Additional hackathon planning and execution A lot more monitoring (support and data)   Grants Hub  Hosted our first DAO-wide Grants 2.0 Playground event Working on Phase 2 Planning (user flow + story mapping) Led our first team retro after hitting MVP milestone  Kickoff Phase 2 of Grant Hub \u2014 have a PRD with user flow and stories ready to review by kickoff   Round Manager  Shipped Steel Thread program/round demo!
