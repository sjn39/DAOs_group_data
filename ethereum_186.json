                    "content": "Some thinking was done around solving for G\u00f6rli\u2019s \u201cempty faucet\u201d problem (amongst others) as part of the Hole\u0161ovice project at ETHPrague in June 2022 (winner of \u201cSustainability\u201d prize). The concept of \u201cephemeral\u201d testnets was discussed, and here I share some of my thoughts from those discussions: I see many pros of having ephemeral testnets, any of which I am happy to expand upon if required: a) to default-sync should be quick, and require less storage because chain will be short. b) faucets can be initialised with a gazillion holETH, solving empty faucet problem, in combination with something like komputing/FaucETH. c) can be initialised with absolute latest L1 codebase, allowing identification of issues sooner rather than later. d) PoS deposit contract can be auto-deployed at genesis, with pre-deposited Validator keys, to enable the potential for a \u201cclean\u201d post-merge network. e) genesis config / codebase could be read from previous testnet\u2019s chainstate/Swarm, which could even be governed onchain. This can serve to reduce reliance on e.g. github, in favour of decentralised storage methods. f) they don\u2019t preclude users from continuing to run them after \u201cofficial\u201d decommissioning, in case they wish to test longer term features. g) can serve to create some kind of framework for a \u201ccadence\u201d / \u201crhythm\u201d to coordinate delivery across the community, e.g. a project can target a release to the testnet launching in December. The duration of the testnets could be divided into agile-like sprints by dev teams, so if the duration were e.g. 28 days, then that\u2019s 4x7day sprints, each sprint 5 on / 2 off (like a \u201cstandard\u201d work week). I believe this can prove to be powerful in terms of ecosystem coordination. h) can work in harmony with long-standing permissionless/permissioned testnets, and indeed provides scope for broader inclusivity in terms of collaboration on base-layer evolution. Some challenges to this approach however: i) newly initialised networks would (at first) be without \u201ccore\u201d protocols e.g. ENS, GnosisSafe, Maker, Uniswap, Aave, Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, Polygon, Livepeer, Swarm, Aragon, ChainLink, Golem (the list goes on and on). I actually think that this can encourage projects to contribute auto-deploy processes, to make sure that their own protocols are available for others to build on. This can also serve to greatly improve tooling for local devnets, or for the likes of scaffold-eth i.e. users could pick and choose which protocols they want to have available to use in their dApp, when running yarn chain. ii) harder for e.g. Infura/Alchemy to support, though perhaps a minor issue given a), as it will be muuch easier to run a node with a few GB of storage. iii) more complicated to keep track of, which is perhaps also a minor issue, requiring a change in the mental model of \u201chow testnets are done\u201d. Some thoughts on this have already been shared here Happy to hear of more challenges though, but for now I am bullish on this concept. To conclude this lengthy post, I believe the prize here is to enable all build environments, whether public testnets or private devnets, to have   the absolute latest L1 stuff: merge, verge, surge, purge etc. for users to develop on top of, providing them with early-access to the known benefits of these upgrades, as well as future-proofed foundations for dApps, and   all network/L2 protocols, for users to integrate their dApps with, providing them with all the \u201cinfrastructure legos\u201d afforded to them by building on the Ethereum network.

                    "content": "EthStaker implemented a solution suggested by potuz to distributing Goerli ETH for the purpose of doing your validator deposit to stake on Goerli. That solution enables anyone to stake using a 0.0001 Goerli ETH deposit instead of the regular 32 Goerli ETH. It uses a combination of a Discord bot, a custom launchpad and a proxy deposit contract to provide an experience that is very similar to the full experience someone can expect on Mainnet while deterring farmers. It has been running for 3 weeks now with good success. The process does not need any harsh verification beside having a Discord account. It should be a solution that works for months for the purpose of testing a validator setup on Goerli. The first major low hanging fruit for any improved permissionless testing network is a much higher ejection balance for validators. Anything close to 31 ETH should help in removing validators who are destroyed or simply not started. An ephemeral and periodically resetting testnet would most likely be another good improvement. Some of the goals and needs of a permissionless testing network for testing your validator setup might conflict with the goals and needs of a testnet for dapp developers. It might be worth exploring splitting both of these use cases in different testnets if possible. Sepolia seems like a nice place for dapp developers. It might be worth spending some time to advertise it as the place to be for testing dapps. ",

Protocols like zkSync bridge G\u00f6ETH over to L2, where they can be used to mint NFTs like the recent zkApe. This means that whichever network is the long-running dApp testnet will always be pathological with regards to its token use: It\u2019ll always have some value. Whether it also has scarcity is another question. Sepolia for example is permissioned, which means \u201cstupid amounts of SepplETH\u201d does not create issues re griefing the validator set. We could sunset - or just restart - G\u00f6rli and have a continuously refreshed validator testground with \u201cplenty of\u201d testETH, while Sepolia becomes the playground for \u201crational actors\u201d, our beloved utter degens. The continous, every N months, refresh of the validator testnet gives a strong incentive for dApps to land on Sepolia, so we don\u2019t find ourselves in this same situation again. We can split the use cases, make testETH not scarce for both use cases, and that should do the trick. We can\u2019t make testETH on the dApp testnet not valuable. It\u2019ll always hold value as long as people want NFTs: But as long as it\u2019s also abundant, that value is so close to zero as to be indistinguishable from zero. ",

                    "content": "Fundamentally, testnet ETH has utility. It is useful in the sense that it can be used to perform work and it can be used to store data. The main way to keep it free is to have an unlimited supply or keep this perception that it is unlimited. Any friction in trying to obtain testnet ETH for any reason will cause someone somewhere to start assigning a real value and a price to that testnet ETH. This is basic supply and demand. Unlimited testnet ETH has some cons. One of them being the ability for someone to spam the network and potentially deny others from using it. Another one is the ability, in a permisionless consensus layer, to spin up a large amount of validators and break the consensus layer with different levels of majority in the validator set. There are various ways to deal with a malicious actor who is trying to spin up a large amount of validators and that will be visible many weeks and months in advance with the current activation queue. The relation between the desire to keep it free and the need to have at least a perceived unlimited supply is a tenuous one. The obvious solutions are to limit supply and/or assign a price above free to testnet ETH. A lot of efforts and energy has been spent in trying to limit supply and find a fair way to perform distribution. Even if we like to say that testnet ETH should be free, the most successful methods for distributing testnet ETH right now force a cost on the user requesting it: time, CPU, third party verification, etc. An unpopular solution that would likely solve many issues around this would be to assign a very low base price to testnet ETH. It could be something like 0.01 USD per 10 testnet ETH. I suspect there might be even better cost or price solutions to be explored. On the supply side, seeding or initializing a testnet with a large amount of ETH, let\u2019s say 1000, in every  wallet address that has ever received or sent a transaction on mainnet or any testnet might be a nice way to seed the distribution. It has a few risks and cons too. It isn\u2019t fair to new developers for instance. It would still need a nice way to distribute new testnet ETH. Faucet distribution is still very hard for any faucet who is going to try to distribution any large amount. ",

                    "content": "\u201cfaucets work fine, what\u2019s actually rendering the network unusable is literally 100% of substantial goerli supply being hoarded instead of sent to faucets.\u201d That\u2019s right. It cannot be prevented when distributing funds freely at the same time. There will always be people that hoard these funds for personal satisfaction or whatever reason they may think of. Ideally there would be enough funds in the network so we don\u2019t need to take special care of them. The current situation on goerli actually introduced a financial benefit for those who hoarded goerli funds earlier. So I\u2019d expect more people are hoarding funds in future testnets as it could happen again. I really appreciate the efforts to inflate the goerli supply, but there are also some caveats we need to think about - especially that the balance of any account must not exceed the max safe integer value as q9f already pointed out. I think that limitation will be problematic very soon if we introduce the withdrawal boost factor. In it\u2019s current proposal state it would allow farmers to multiply their whole balance in every partial withdrawal interval (see my comment on simulate deposits/withdrawals under constraints of prater with various withdrawal boost factor \u00b7 Issue #135 \u00b7 eth-clients/goerli \u00b7 GitHub) Just think about what happens if someone runs 100 validators and repeatedly deposits his whole balance to the validator that gets partially withdrawn next\u2026 \u2026 I\u2019d suggest creating the \u201cHolesovice\u201d testnet much earlier (probably even this year) and initialize it with more than enough funds. That would be a direct successor of goerli, allowing all kind of staking tests etc. We should still keep up goerli for some time. It\u2019s still great for testing, but will slowly die due to the funding issues during the LTS timespan. ",

Let me show why we are important. firstly, the penalty for malicious behavior by the pos network is the confiscation of tokens , on the goelri network, that\u2019s goerli eth . If goerli eth is worthless, then punishment is worthless . Hackers can destroy and attack unscrupulously. Moreover, if goerli can have a large group of nodes that are really validators for their own interests, then goerli will be the closest and safest test network to the mainnet, and the test in goerli will be more valuable. I believe that goerli may also meet some issues will be valuable to ethereum. Secondly, as far as I know, many testnet test coins can be sold for money, whether they are in short supply or not. It is very difficult for the network to provide stable faucet for a long time, and all kinds of problems will occur, not to mention the most famous testnet(goerli) , used by many developers and users . Finally, from the user\u2019s point of view, users hope that they can easily obtain test coins instead of looking around for faucets that are still available. With the current faucet, one person may only receive 0.1 goerli eth a day, which is not enough for everyone, but it can resist hacker attacks. This is ridiculous, the purpose of the faucet is to let the user use it, so almost all faucets failed. But look at our faucet-dao, hundreds of people have bought goerli eth from us, and everyone who bought it is very happy, they are grateful to us. We like to make our project an exploration of the community. Once we sold over 50k goerli eth at a very low price, about 1 $ = 2000+ goerli eth. We don\u2019t have a strong desire to control, we hope to solve the problem of goerli eth.  image1082\u00d7246 43.8 KB  What do you think of faucet-dao, q9f  ,offical team , and u \uff1f ",

It is a huge drawback for any free distributing system / established faucet, because farming activity will be increased drastically. Get something for free that you can sell afterwards is a great way for degens to make money - they don\u2019t care if it breaks anything if they can get some $ for it (from my experience these are mostly indian / chinese users\u2026 they\u2019re worse than blowflies if there\u2019s something \u201cfree\u201d on the table). So if we allow such markets and introduce a price to goerli funds, we\u2019re breaking all free faucets and making them impossible to operate in future. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s worth it. Testnets are meant to be free! If they wouldn\u2019t, you could directly deploy to mainnet too. Currently there are enough faucets left that drop small amounts of funds (including my PoW one). These drops should be more than enough to deploy contracts and test interactions. You normally don\u2019t need bigger amounts of funds for testing. (except testing staking setups, but there will be a new testnet for that soon) So please don\u2019t break these remaining faucets and keep goerli free for everyone like it should be! ",

First of all, let me explain that faucet-dao is not the first person to do goerli eth over-the-counter trading, there have been people trading goerli eth for a long time. Faucet-dao just put the pool on uniswap, so that more people can conduct simple transactions goerli eth instead of p2p transactions. The second point, is it free faucet, really completely free \uff1fWe all know that in addition to the official Ethereum faucets, some of the faucets that get goerli eth need to register an account, and some need to retweets, which indirectly promote the project. These behaviors that bring traffic, I think, can be counted as the income of the project, and they can obtain good financing through these data. As for pow faucets, you can let us mine valuable coins, all power is in your hands.I don\u2019t think trading goerli eth will break free faucets, the core of current free faucets is not completely free.They have their own additional benefits. The third point, you said that the testnet should be free, which I don\u2019t think is entirely true. What are the useful and free things in this world besides air? Goerli eth is very useful for developers, if it is scarce it will have a price, if it is in large quantities, its price will approach 0. I think the official should provide a free testnet, and the pos pledge of goerli-net should be free. This is all done, you just need to be in sepolia, then you are free. I\u2019m a developer and I know it\u2019s important to have a development environment closer to the eth mainnet. We are willing to pay one dollar or two to get an open pos network, not a fake pos network. This is completely different from the thousands of dollars of deployment contracts on the Ethereum mainnet.

Officially, creating a market for Goerli ETH. Starting price $0.10 for 1 Goerli ETH. I completely agree with @sole12343 and laid out very simiar points in my reply to Layer Zero\u2019s announcement even before seeing this post. In summary, this is actually a good thing because creating a market for Goerli ETH means that more people will actually get Goerli ETH now not less.  Free creates scarcity. The more popular ETH becomes, the more scarcity there will be of Goerli ETH Creating a price for Goerli ETH creates a market which incentivizes people to supply Goerli ETH If you want to prevent people being priced out of testnet ETH, the solution is to keep the supply high and flood the market with testnet ETH.  Finally as @sole12343 and I have both said, testnet eth has never really been free. Either we paid with time by going to different services or with attention to companies that got marketing exposure by providing testnet eth. We\u2019ve already been paying for testnet crypto. This simply adds money as one of the options.  FpmdZ-eaMAAps-N888\u00d7499 93 KB  ",
