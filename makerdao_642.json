                    "content": " Correction to Last Week\u2019s Executive Hi everyone, I would like to let you know that in last week\u2019s executive, PECU referenced an incorrect end date for Strategic Finance (SF-001) and StarkNet (SNE-001) DAI core unit payments. This occurred despite it being correctly documented in the Executive Vote Implementation Process spreadsheet maintained by GovAlpha. We will be including the correction in tomorrow\u2019s executive.  Details of the error: For these two streams, the end date of the executive incorrectly had end dates of 2023-07-31, where the end date should have been 2022-07-31. All other streams involved in the Jan 28th executive had a correct 2023 end date.  Remediation: We will be updating tomorrow\u2019s executive to include the correct dates as follows and as documented in the copy of the above executive:  SNE-001 FROM 2022-03-01 TO 2022-07-31 0x6D348f18c88D45243705D4fdEeB6538c6a9191F1 SF-001 FROM 2022-03-01 TO 2022-07-31 0xf737C76D2B358619f7ef696cf3F94548fEcec379  The 4th Feb executive will therefore include the following:  Yanking the old vest at the time of cast Sending the February unpaid amount at the time of cast Sending a bulk payment for the first month (February) less the amount accrued at the time of spell cast Creating a new vest beginning March 1st and ending July 31st, 2022  The result of this change is that the affected core units will recieve a bulk Dai payment immediately in the amount of their expected first month\u2019s vest. They will obtain a new vesting contract for the remainder of the term.  Post Mortem & Future Improvements to Spell Creation PECU have discussed the error internally and will be completing a post-mortem in the coming week with some suggestions as to how we can optimise the spell creation process and the various hand-offs that are involved. We apologize for the error and have informed SF and SNE as to the above pending update. ",
