It\u2019s not as if there will be some catalyst in the future to do this. Build the treasury now and reinvest it into growth. No one is leaving bc of the small fee, especially when it\u2019s issued to build out interoperable pools between layer 1 and layer 2s. Imagine 1 pool that serves L1, polygon, optimism, and so on.
