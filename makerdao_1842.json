A simple way to rally MKR holders to protect the hat, delegate, or determine their own involvement. Simply put, a community for MKR holders, a place to belong. Enter: a token-gated channel on the MakerDAO Discord. Bridging a communication gap between holders and contributors. Opening this environment could increase voter participation, MKR delegation and a sense of community and agency for MKR holders.  image1023\u00d7594 102 KB  Working off the SPACES model from CMX we can target Acquisition, Engagement, and Success for MKR holders by giving them a place for opt-in coordination. We\u2019re suggesting an easy way for large MKR holders first (>500 MKR) and eventually opening the channel to smaller holders. (<10MKR). Core unit members and recognized delegates would be added manually. Delegated MKR counts as MKR held. This informal poll is about community feedback, clustering around the pros & cons of lowering this communication loop and dialing in the numbers. As voter committees start to come online, an async gathering place is especially helpful.  MKR Holders Channel Purpose  Participate  A place to connect with other MKR holders to discuss strategy or just hang out. This channel could be where voter committees (or some version of focused groups), holders, and delegates congregate around agendas and topics (in the form of Discord threads) outside of regular meetings. Voting experiments:  Pulse checks with emoji votes A possible first draft of off-chain polls. Sourcing signal on a hard choice for MKR holders before opening it up for more eyes might cut unnecessary chatter. Vote alerts and MKR in borrowing platforms alerts to channel     Events  Onboarding & special events for MKR holders, with links only going to this channel Forum at a glance and publications dropped in-channel directly Regular for MKR-eyes only calls announced here.   Alpha  Early ticket invites to events from partners Inclusion for testing of products that haven\u2019t been launched yet Product discounts from partners (Nansen comes to mind) Growth can go all out on sourcing cool things for MKR holders exclusively. Safe space for market-cope.  Possible validation platforms are Our Guild or https://collab.land/ to validate a token gate in discord.  Pros  Growth loop: MKR holder joins chat \u2192 publicly talks about the great experience \u2192 sourcing more dormant MKR holders to join and post. Prioritization and blind spot catching. Can run native polls via emoji voting to get quick pulse checks before forum posts or as sentiment before adding things on-chain. Room to grow: include smaller holders, launch its own Discord server, and try fun governance stuff.   Cons  Both Guild and Collab.land are new-ish products and can have some friction  Link outs are spoofy, too,   It\u2019s intimidating to connect wallets to services. Creates a dynamic of exclusion for regular community members or new contributors. More noise to manage for maintainers of the Discord If we use Voltaire for anon discussions: Posting anonymously using a bot has friction, and you\u2019re immediately doxxed if you forget. There is no way for Discord to have hidden roles AND keep single channels anonymous without some heavy javascripting.  Next steps: Should this poll provide positive momentum, we can ask tech-ops how feasible it would be to add either service\u2019s bot, add a channel, add a role or simple token gate, and map this into the MakerDAO discord. Extra credit points: we could enable Voltaire as the bot to enable anonymity.  Polls    Should we pursue a token-gated MKR holder channel in Discord?  Yes No Abstain I hate discord, long live IRC     0 voters        Should we use Voltaire for anonymous participation?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        Should the first MKR gate be:  100 MKR 500 MKR 1000 MKR More? Suggest the amount below Less? Suggest a plan below     0 voters     ",

Example: suppose a CU member join the channel (many CU-members are MKR holders). But at some point they quit (or worse, they are kicked out by a bot). People will infer that they sold their MKR.  it might be the case that he just used the MKR in a DeFi protocol (like aave) It might be the case that he had to sell for a short amount of time, maybe he\u2019s just playing the \u201ctrader game\u201d and hoping to make a profit  in any of these cases, the reactions could be negative with \u201cWTF!?\u201d moments. So I am not entirely sure that this idea will play out positively. Also     ultraschuppi:  we should start with a lower MKR treshold, 10 MKR would be enough from my PoV   while democratic, I am afraid would likely just be perceived as a waste of time/noise by whales with 3k MKR. All in all, MakerDAO discord channel (at the moment at least) already has very few active users, and generally quite polite and well informed. I don\u2019t know if it is worth creating additional Elite channels. ",

We\u2019ll start with asking TechOps if installing guild or collab.land is doable and secure, and then try an MKR channel, because it is very easy to implement.
