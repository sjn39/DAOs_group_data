Wintermute Trading will have to return either the full loan amount or 100 million USDC (~400% premium to current price) in 1 year Wintermute will commit to maintain inventory and liquidity in MKR and DAI across all major centralised and decentralised exchanges.  Wintermute basic background Wintermute was founded in July 2017 by three Optiver veterans. Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO, was previously head of ETFs (screen and OTC) at Optiver Europe, one of the largest ETF market making desks. Wintermute\u2019s trading volume in 2H 2020 surpassed $70B and their average daily trading volumes in 2021 are over $3B Wintermute is backed by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Pantera, Blockchain.com Ventures and others Wintermute Trading is registered with FCA for our OTC business Wintermute Defi and Maker specific background Wintermute believes defi is the future of financial industry and Maker will be one of the pillars of new age. Wintermute wants to lead adoption by committing a significant part of it\u2019s resources and at the same time getting exposure to leading teams by becoming the official MM in protocol tokens or direct investments, examples of recent work in that direction:  Designated MM for major defi projects like Polygon, Indexed, Skale, dydx exchange, Working with Paxos on de-risking Maker PSM collateral by depositing 500mil USDP actively supporting MKR and DAI trading on dex and cex for over two years integrated our trading system with Maker and PSM in order to keep DAI peg  Specifically for Maker community Wintermute commits to:  Provide liquid markets for MKR and DAI across centralised exchanges* Support MKR and DAI liquidity on ethereum and other L2s via trading against the pool or directly LP-ing where necessary fund the other side of the pair with its own capital. If an exchange requires GBP, Euro, BTC, USDC, etc. to settle a trade, Wintermute will be able to provide it. Provide OTC services for large MKR trades - this would give best execution for potential buyers and also protect the price of the token for sellers as well Use MKR tokens received for a purpose of market making only. Wintermute would never lend, yield-farm or use those for voting.  *comprising of: Binance, Huobi, OKEX, Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, crypto.com, binanceus and a few smaller ones EDIT 28th of October - Call option strike price have been raised to $10k per MKR which means much better terms for Maker community and to show our commitment.

If so, how do you maintain that \u201cleg-up\u201d and what are the key benefits that your experience in both MM and the fact you have a head-start in crypto brings to market making MKR tokens? With regards to MM in DEXes ( I personally wish you offered this to the community), any chances you can MM in both DAI and MKR on DEXes like Serum, or Osmosis(Cosmos) via a wrapped token in the near future? Do you think there\u2019s any downside to MM in CEXes exposed to China\u2019s recent crackdown of crypto and CEXes like Huobi, OKEX, cutting back on such? Or, do you think the fact they are also domiciled in other countries like S. Korea and Singapore is sufficient for the exposure to these centralized exchanges? EDIT: BTW, will you be providing Market DATA to Maker \u2013 perhaps to the Oracles Team? Similar to what Jane/Jump trading do for PYTH. ",

This means there is no traditional arm like the Jane Streets, Flows, Jumps, etc. of the world where we have to \u201canswer to\u201d.  We are 100% focused on digital assets and set up to provide a fair, efficient, and liquid market place.  Again, we have a designated Defi team whom have spent years building our backend infrastructure - not sure there is any other firm that can compare. I want to touch base on some points that were brought up and somethings I missed during my talk. We are in the process of integrating with Solana.  What this means is that we can start market making and providing liquidity on protocols on top of Solana once this is completed.  Like so many other projects (Polygon, dydx exchange, etc.), we are/were immensely important to scaling up adoption as liquidity will always be important and necessary. Wintermute will fund the other side of the MKR token leg with its own capital.  This is Wintermute\u2019s cost.  All the pairs, ETH, DAI, USDT, GBP, EURO, etc. that trade across cefi/defi will be Wintermute\u2019s responsibility. As easy as aiding in price discover across different venues sounds, I welcome anyone and everyone to try - banking partnerships, exchange partnerships, algorithmic bots, capital expenditure on each venue, etc., etc., etc. One last thing about liquidity.  Seems like not all are sold on having \u201ctoo much\u201d liquidity.  If your perception is this will suppress the price, obviously this would be mirrored on the way down.  Also, there\u2019s no way any market maker or any asset in this space can have too much liquidity - we\u2019re talking about cryptos right now\u2026 ",

                    "content": "Thank you for the questions, will try to address everything mentioned so far: PaperImperium - we had prior experience of signing MM agreement between Wintermute and DAO directly and DAO treasury releasing token loan to Wintermute multisig. Not sure if that means any complications on Maker DAO side, but we have had it working with no issues before. Alternatively can always go via separate legal entity funded by Maker DAO. On the second question regarding legal implications of provisioning MM, we did not hear about such cases before, hard to answer really, but I think those decisions are taken based on a token, not based on whome you send a token to. ElProgreso - our advantage is that we focus on crypto trading exclusively, including defining-native integrations. More traditional market makers don\u2019t really go that deep into this new financial industry, definitely not deep enough to trade or LP on dex as we do. MMing on Chinese CEXes definitely has an increased risk, but we handle it internally in multiple ways. We are open to providing Market DATA to Maker, but this would be a separate discussion I think. Joshua Pritikin - the problem Wintermute is trying to solve is providing liquidity on DEX and CEX for MKR and DAI. Before this was taken care by Maker Foundation having MM agreements with market makers, but now, that Maker Foundation has been dissolved, this is no longer the case and would have to be handled by Maker DAO. Existing liquidity did not appear out of nowhere, it was provided by previous market makers. There is obviously a natural growth and there are independent traders LPing on dexes as well as trading on cefi, but they rarely can provide guaranteed liquidity if market makers stop providing services.

Because that is its fundamental purpose at this point in the project - the minting and burning aspects exist to incentivise the effective governance of the Maker Protocol, though the mint functionality does have a nice side-effect in that it acts as lender of last resort. Initially MKR was also required for raising funds to support the development of the protocol, given the protocol is now more or less self-sustaining, that purpose is mostly gone. As I said above, the point that owning MKR might lead to holders becoming active in governance is an argument in favour. Easy and liquid access to the token is useful in that it potentially results in more governance participants. My point is more that we should understand that the goal is increasing the number and spread of token holders that are willing to govern the protocol, rather than liquidity being an end of itself.

                    "content": "One thing few people point out is that MKR only has about 1M tokens, A good chunk of those are required for governance to function. I have posted elsewhere a DeepLiquidity thesis regarding how to build community value via a v2 Uniswap contract (not v3) via Token-Stablecoin pair.    The conclusions in my own analysis was that if one could get about 1/3 of the available liquidity paired with a stablecoin the Token price support would be limited to no lower than a 90% drop.  In fact if you figure out actual open market liquidity it simply couldn\u2019t be this bad (you need all the other 66% tokens to come out and sell which is unlikely).   This also presumes LP suppliers don\u2019t pull and sell.   The whole point was to focus trading and liquidity into a single DEX venue where all LPs shared equally in fees and where liquidity and trading could be focused. CEX\u2019s liquidity doesn\u2019t really do dink for providing community value because these MM players can come and go as the winds blow.   Same is true of LP providers BUT if the dominant LP provider IS the community then it is rather unlikely the community governance would pull liquidity.   BTW.  All of this has issues for MKR simply because such a collection of liquidity could be used to attack governance itself (this has already been discussed). I always come back to the prime questions here.   What is the goal of additional liquidity?   Is it to stay listed, is it to backstop community value (so if MKR needs to sell it can get a good price with decent liquidity).   Is it governance activities.? I am back to using MKR as a rewards token honestly because this would get us a good chunk more cycling liquidity, deeper MKR markets generally, etc.   Put simply with a MC of what 2-2.5B there just is no way 200M is going to enter or exit this market without significant price impact.   In fact even 1-2% (10-20K MKR) or 30-60M could move the price around 5-10% easily.   This is just the nature of this market and I don\u2019t see how greasing the wheels for other players to trade here satisfies any of the key goals because there is no reason to believe these players care one whit about MKR valuation.   They are Market neutral which means they will not hold a position so they don\u2019t care which way MKRs price blows. I am not against this because I believe they will move the price, price is going to do what it does.  I am generally against this because I don\u2019t believe the community has any real clear goals. For this reason I was more for creating an additional MKR-R reward token that under conditions could be swapped for MKR, and also could burn in conjunction with MKR (buy MKR to burn then use some MKR to buy MKR-R to burn to form the long term value proposition for MKR-R with MKR etc.) and this way we could finally get a rewards token that has value, with a mint (say 1B instead of this 1M) to focus the value of MKR into a different more highly traded and much more liquid token which focuses back its value on the governance MKR token. The point here isn\u2019t the issues with disconnecting governance value from actual governance but building somewhat separate token to add value in multiple ways to the protocol enhancing the overall value to the protocol in many different ways.  rewarding borrowers expanding deposits and DAI borrow. with possibility of negative rates. Building a collection of token values around the Maker protocol not just MKR Creating a potential to explore new governance models using MKR-R Bringing new people into the Maker governance system. With 1B outstanding and even a price of $1-3 US if MKR holds it\u2019s value MKR-R addition would double Maker community Market cap and give it additional monetary and governance tools.  Maker doesn\u2019t need to be stuck as a one token pony but can use two or more. I honestly really like the two token model of /r/ethtrader where they have the financial token coupled with a contribution token to create the vote=min(DONUT,CONTRIB) where DONUT is the financial and CONTRIB is a earned token that does NOT move from a wallet once acquired. I am not saying we should follow this particular model.  But with two tokens there are many more possibilites for governance and value building than with one token. In the end: I am against this because I think there are a lot more discussion that needs to happen here before governance considers doing deals with MM\u2019s on the MKR token.   Maker needed this in the past I am not entirely sure it needs this today, or at least not via this particular style of liquidity providing and MM making. ",

This is of course not the fault of Wintermute, it was just a case of unlucky timing.   So, I think a point that is being missed here is that adding liquidity to MKR provides opportunities for DeFi Fund style vehicles like the Grayscale DeFi index that holds MKR. IMO these type of vehicles will expand/get more popular and trading desk are going to need the liquidity\u2013especially since most have to work within compliant grounds\u2013meaning via centralized exchanges.

You all are one of the most respected trading desks in the space, and seeing you embrace the transparent process here is excellent. On the proposal itself, I believe these sorts of terms \u2013 unsecured loans with a \u201cquasi-call option\u201d at the loan\u2019s conclusion \u2013 are pretty standard and do not strike me as unreasonable. That said, I\u2019ll defer to others on whether it\u2019s warranted for MKR on CEXes and DEXes, as I do not feel strongly. (Note: I think it\u2019s clear as day why Dai liquidity is essential across the space). While we consider this deal, we should also look at decentralized liquidity provisioning options popping up. One I know of is Tokemak (here\u2019s some interesting literature about the project) though there might be others. To the extent we as a community can locate and engage with a decentralized approach to seeing liquidity provided, it behooves us to do. Disclosure: I hold MKR and TOKE (Tokemak\u2019s governance/liquidity director token), so I would stand to personally benefit from seeing a relationship between MakerDAO and the TokeMak community. ",

                    "content": "Improving liquidity in all the main networks is essential for the Maker Protocol because of the following reasons:  Liquidity is a significant indicator for traders, investors and almost all crypto users to determine if a project is worth it or not.      LongForWisdom:  the goal is increasing the number and spread of token holders that are willing to govern the protocol, rather than liquidity being an end of itself.   Yes, that\u2019s the goal, but we also have to understand that under the current circumstances we can\u2019t expect of asking retail to vote. The reality is that investors are the ones investing in DeFi and participating in governance because they want to see their investment grow.  Liquidity is the base of crypto, is what keeps crypto alive. When exchanges or crypto projects decide which token to integrate, they look for the most liquid tokens. Low liquidity will bring problems in the future for these projects. This has a serious impact on DAI. Right now with the multichain strategy of the entire crypto ecosystem, having low liquidity in the newest networks will have a negative impact on the adoption of DAI. And for MKR is also a problem:   The security of the protocol is semi-dependent on the liquidity of MKR and that in its current state we\u2019re not protecting ourselves sufficiently in a tail event. In the event of a solvency crisis, where we have to mint MKR it\u2019s better to have a lot of liquidity to sell into and not to mint and dump MKR into a thin market.    Greater liquidity leads to fair price discovery and removes the chance of distorted pricing. That\u2019s one of the biggest problems we have now with MKR. We all witnessed how PlanetX selling his MKR had a dramatic impact on the token, and how the recent increase in MKR showed us an unhealthy price action   New networks mean new DAI and MKR distribution channels, and the projects on those networks will be looking for the most liquid markets   I think the current liquidity on ethereum is decent but is not enough to support the expansion we are experiencing on other networks (and is not ideal until we don\u2019t have a decent MKR/DAI pair) and doesn\u2019t protect the protocol in the event of a solvency crisis. Besides that, although it\u2019s great to have community members providing liquidity, we can\u2019t depend on individuals. The protocol\u2019s liquidity can\u2019t rely on individuals. Wintermute\u2019s proposal is fair, what they do it\u2019s not just to deposit MKR in uniswap. They are providing other\u2019s pair liquidity -even fiat, which requires a bank account-, they are maintaining their bots with a neutral strategy, they will deploy liquidity in different networks (talking about that, hop protocol needs DAI liquidity if we want the multichain-DAI) and they want a call option for buying MKR.     Aes:  Additionally, I would like to have a formal service agreement that protects MKR holders from Wintermute running off with the loaned MKR (not that I believe Wintermute would) - we could possible use the RWA Foundation structure   It\u2019s possible, but what I find interesting is to explore other options and understand how they are doing business with other DAOs. Reputation is valuable for us and them, and that\u2019s what allowed us to have an agreement with the Nexo IV without a company. ",

                    "content": "    Nadia:  Improving liquidity in all the main networks is essential for the Maker Protocol because of the following reasons:   There appears to be a distinct lack of understanding of different kinds of liquidity and what more or less of them mean for a particular token or equity. Holders are indirectly a key source of sell side liquidity, and on occasion are a source of buy side liquidity.   Though these players tend to look at the longer term and don\u2019t make a significant difference to liquidity in markets unless there are significant price moves (mostly up where these players may sell some of their holdings to reap profits). Price Arbitragers - these players only seek to profit from price discrepancies between markets and generally take a market neutral position.   Though if you are an actual price arbitrager to be efficient you often have to hold a position (in cash, and in coin) to be able to act to perform arbitrage.     The reason is that cycling latency is often the hitch on price arbitrage (to move cash from one exchange to another or tokens).    Arbitragers are an important part of the ecosystem and while they \u2018can\u2019 normalize prices they do not by themselves move the price in either direction (unless they are entering or exiting making arbitrage on any particular issue).   So they don\u2019t provide liquidity directly. In current markets there is another form of liquidity.   MKR borrowers (who might borrow MKR to short it).  This liquidity is limited to MKR deposits to borrow, and credit of borrowers to put up other deposits to borrow.   This is limited by the available borrow and the equity of the borrowers. Short traders are another key liquidity source btw and probably on par with arbitragers but it is a directional liquidity - not price neutral like arbitragers. There is another kind of liquidity that we have and this is positional liquidity using a type of options note.  For example trading on DYDX in MKR doesn\u2019t trade in the underlying but is a cash settled options position.   This can look like it provides liquidity when in fact it is liquidity neutral, and ultimately price neutral (for every option sold there is a buyer and vice versa). Now every DAO that uses it\u2019s token for governance there is a distinct competition because the governance mechanics are often segregated from the token being used to provide liquidity.   Maker has this problem in spades.   MKR in AAVE is precluded from voting, MKR in governance doesn\u2019t earn a return in AAVE.   This causes division of liquidity for purpose.  MKR in governance doesn\u2019t provide market liquidity for traders, and MKR in AAVE doesn\u2019t participate in governance. Everyone is worried about liquidity but most people seem rather naive about what the actual goal is nor how to achieve it. A number of DAO projects are now starting to focus on managing DAO owned liquidity.  Why?  Because they are realizing just as I have via my DeepLiquidity thesis DAO DeepLiquidity - 1Hive that:  Paring a DAO token with a stablecoin (or some other widely traded valuable coin) can provide a pricing backstop. DAO LP tends to be sticky and doesn\u2019t leave the LP willy nilly. DAOs recognize the importance of their Token retaining value - so much so these contracts are incentivized with farming rewards (which everyone including the DAO earns - so the DAO can feed this back into the LP with its pairing token) DAOs that do this often have governance mechanics that allow LP tokens to vote in governance making it so that there is no competition between tokens seeking return and providing liquidity with providing governance functions.  To this end part of my growth thesis was that Maker should follow this lead and seek to  build a strong MKR-DAI v2 LP using it\u2019s own funds on either sushiswap or uniswap. Alter the governance contracts so that MKR-DAI v2 LP can both participate in governance AND be able to borrow DAI against the v2 LP.  I will have more on the above as it is one of the prime components of a vision for Maker and a growth proposal. Put simply the v2 UNISWAP LP, autocompounds interest, can\u2019t be flash crashed, and if roughtly 1/3 of the available token liquidity is paired with a stablecoin at a price then the token price can only drop by ~50% if 1/3 of the remaining liquidity sells, 1/9 if ALL the remaining liquidity sells and to obtain 1/2 the liquidity in the contract the price has to quadruple.   This is strong price support, fully democratic LP (no LP in v2 has a preference for earning over other LP unlike other AMM LPs). The point here is if MakerDAO is concened about having liquidity to sell 50-100K MKR into we should be seeking to build a DAO based v2 MKR-DAI LP by incentivizing it so it can participate in governance as LP, and have some option to borrow DAI against this LP (just like MKR can do in AAVE or COMPOUND with some caveats I will elaborate in my series of growth posts). Arbitragers will naturally pop up once there is a key DEX trading venue to arb between other networks (hell i would do this more).   Trading would be predominantly done on the DEX under the LP and ALL LP (including DAO owned) would earn fees from this trading. BUT the key point.  If we can get to 200-300K paired with DAI Maker will be able to sell into this market MKR to raise DAI,  in a pinch we could even pull a bit of this liquidity to get our DAI back and sell some MKR. This is the path to MKR DeepLiquidity not this 10K MKR arbitrager that basically wants to be able to take a free stake on the long MKR side (at the expense of MKR) to provide arbitrage liquidity (Wintermute claims it will be market neutral).   Then they also want a 10K MKR call option on top of this.   This isn\u2019t being neutral at all but in fact looking to use their arbitrage opportunity to drive the price up and profit long. Everyone wants to treat Maker and MKR as a shit coin that needs support when in fact all MakerDAO needs to do is a couple of key things that have a distinct result of creating concentrated key liquidity, profit sharing democratically on trades, available for low slippage price arb.   Everyone thinks we need to spread this across networks, if we do that across every network that pops up there simply isn\u2019t enough MKR to provide decent trading liquidity.   Maker only needs one deep market to provide what it needs to itself, price backing liquidity that has sufficient market depth for low slippage trading and a mechanism to include this v2 MKR-DAI LP into governance. Add in governance rewards A DAO willing to stake it\u2019s own MKR with DAI from SB to provide liquidity to earn fees. And some ability to borrow DAI on this v2 Liquidity I think these three things would do much more than anything Wintermute can do. We can still do wintermute.   But without any performance metrics I am against this.   I share the same concern as @psychonaut adding a call option only causes wintermute to have a directional bias to arbitrage.  Given the low current liquidity for Maker this will be an easy hit, and sure can make everyone happy. But don\u2019t we want to build Deeper Liquidity than 10K? Don\u2019t we want to do something that is more sustainable with less risk that everyone can participate in? This idea that Maker needs to give up 30M worth of MKR freely to get \u2018liquidity\u2019 seems excessive to me.   MKR is going to hit 10K because of fundamentals not because of wintermute and if Maker needs to sell 10-50K MKR what wintermute is doing isn\u2019t going to help build that.   Building a MKR-DAI v2 DAO vault with significant liqudity does. ",

MakerMan:  The point here is if MakerDAO is concened about having liquidity to sell 50-100K MKR into we should be seeking to build a DAO based v2 MKR-DAI LP by incentivizing it so it can participate in governance as LP   I believe you are misunderstanding the problem Wintermute and the Growth Team are trying to solve here. Its not just about MKR-DAI LP liquidity, its about many LP pairs (as stated in the proposal) for both DEX and CEX. Perhaps a top-tier trading desk wants MKR-GBP as their prefer settlement process. I believe it is imperative that MKR is available in multiple flavors as institutional interest in crypto increases\u2013and such institutions will take into consideration both credit & default risk in order to proceed via DeFi applications. I also think that it is important for Delegates to understand the core mission that the Growth CU is trying to accomplish. Sending a signal that Market Making across the board is not necessary, will only impede their ability to close deals. Best to reach out and understand their BD goals, IMO. ",
