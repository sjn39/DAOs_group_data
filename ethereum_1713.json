Other topics  it was discussed how to deal with the limited supply of Goerli Ether  the merge will unlock some deposited Ether and make it available again the merge will also introduce actual block rewards   ChainLink will reach out to EF (Tim?) to propose taking over Rinkeby we need to reach out to infrastructure providers to communicate testnet deprecation, e.g., MetaMask, Etherscan, etc.  ",

The main obstacles are not the clients but rather infrastructure (faucets, explores, RPC endpoints) for Goerli and Sepolia; also, deprecating infrastructure for dead testnets and communicating this with key stakeholders. One thing that could be interesting for the ACD is what I discussed briefly with Marius about having a PoA-style beacon-chain consensus for post-merge testnets, i.e., application-testnets not necessarily require 100k\u2019s of validators and might as well run on 16 reliable validators similar to how Rinkeby or Goerli are operated.

Marius, who was at the session, gave an update   PoA-style beacon-chain consensus for post-merge testnets, i.e., application-testnets not necessarily require 100k\u2019s of validators and might as well run on 16 reliable validators similar to how Rinkeby or Goerli are operated.  Yeah, something like this was already planned: having one testnet where the validator set is more open, and one where it\u2019s mostly controlled by client teams & the EF. We\u2019re tracking these discussions in the GH issue you posted previously, and I expect we\u2019ll have some updates on it as we think through how we upgrade the various testnets for the merge. ",

Problem statement:   Goerli only has 115M GoETH total supply  Goerli is the only/main testnet for testing validator setups Circa 80-90% of the total supply is in \u201ccirculation\u201d or locked in deposit contracts Goerli has been traded OTC since 2021 Cannot test validators on Sepolia (permissioned) Cannot test validators on Ropsten (deprecated)   Difficult to test beacon-chain valida\u2026     ",
