                    "content": "Authors: @itzler (Variant), @HelloShreyas and @verto0912 (Llama) Updates: We appreciate the positive engagement and feedback we received from our initial proposal. This proposal has been updated based on feedback from community members. The changes include:  Updated the stated long-term goals of the program to include ecosystem growth over the long-term. Increased the rewards allocated for deposit receipt tokens from 2% to 4% to account for the fact that holders of deposit receipt tokens in v3 will forfeit any of the underlying protocol\u2019s liquidity incentives. Excluded aTokens from ULP as they require a wrapper contract that has not yet been audited. We will consider including aTokens in the future. Updated the overall allocations for ULP based on the increase in rewards for Deposit Receipt Tokens and the exclusion of aTokens.  Note that this is just the beginning of the Uniswap Liquidity Program (v0.1!). We want to start simple and evaluate the program\u2019s effectiveness before we expand it. We will provide periodic updates on ULP to Uniswap governance and seek community feedback. Snapshot: The Snapshot vote will be live for 5 days to get a consensus check. Summary: This proposal outlines a framework for establishing a liquidity incentives program (Uniswap Liquidity Program, ULP) with the goals of: accelerating the migration of liquidity to Uniswap v3; encouraging new market participants to experiment with liquidity provision, further distributing ownership of UNI tokens, and supporting ecosystem growth over the long-term. We propose the program start with an initial maximum budget of 1.662m UNI, to be allocated as liquidity incentives across two quarters. Continuation of the program will require an additional governance vote. Upon renewal of the program, each of the three initiatives can be broken out into separate proposals. The program will aim to bootstrap liquidity across three different initiatives:  Stablecoin pairs Mid-tail pairs (e.g DeFi governance tokens) Deposit receipt tokens (i.e. cTokens, aTokens)  Similarly to the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP), pair selection is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated: any action requires close monitoring and frequent reporting to the Uniswap community. To this end, we propose a discretionary committee of 8 members \u2014 5 core members from LlamaDAO to actively lead & manage the committee, as well 3 members for oversight. Find Llama\u2019s full proposal & management plan detailed here. The committee structure allows for incentives to be allocated efficiently across many pairs without requiring a full governance vote on each pair selection. However, Uniswap governance retains ultimate oversight by granting a budget on a bi-quarterly basis. Purpose & Background: While Uniswap v3 has quickly emerged as the market leading DEX, we believe that it has yet to reach its full potential. In particular, large amounts of liquidity remain locked in Uniswap v2, and a majority of v2 LPs have yet to migrate over the v3. Liquidity incentive programs have seen varying degrees of success. In Uniswap\u2019s case, the initial liquidity incentive program between September\u2014November 2020 was met with considerable interest:  Protocol liquidity quickly increased from ~$750M in the week preceding the program to ~$3B at peak. The number of individual addresses holding more than 0 LP tokens increased by ~75% from ~33,500 to ~59,000. The unique UNI token holder base grew by 14% over the course of 2 months.  A contributing factor here is that Uniswap v2 has an organic user-base, which drives organic swap yields to LPs. We expect and hope that a liquidity incentives program on Uniswap v3 would succeed in increasing wider LP participation, liquidity across sought-after pairs, UNI distribution, and swap volume. Importantly, due to v3\u2019s Concentrated Liquidity feature, Uniswap governance can afford to pay significantly lower reward rates than previous liquidity mining programs to achieve similar market depth. Quarterly Budget:  Max quarterly budget of up to 826,091 UNI across all initiatives to start In addition to the quarterly budget, LlamaDAO (core committee members) is to be collectively compensated at a rate of $150 per hour up to 30 hours a week. Each month, oversight members will be responsible for calculating exchange rate from UNI to USD and appropriate payouts (estimated at ~2917 UNI per quarter), with payments being made in UNI. Oversight members will be compensated at a rate of 300 UNI per quarter.  Pair Selection Committee:  5 core committee members, composed of LlamaDAO team members for the first term, as well as 3 oversight committee members. Each committee has a term of 2 quarters (6 months) after which the program and members need to be renewed by UNI governance. Committee functions as a 5 of 6 multi-sig, with 3 members of LlamaDAO and 3 members from the oversight committee. Committee to share a weekly report detailing the decision making process (using a standard template) and periodic updates detailing the successes and failures of the program.  Committee Members: Committee member criteria include:  Credibly neutral \u2014 need to avoid any sense of conflict of interest Ability to evaluate fundamental strengths of projects and their place in the ecosystem Data driven \u2014 capable of assessing quantitative merits/growth signals  Committee members must recuse themselves from any ULP decision related to a project they hold an investment in or are otherwise related to. Core Committee Members (Llama):   AG: project management and evaluation  Shreyas Hariharan: project management, coordinate with Uniswap governance and stakeholders  Mason: project management, create progress reports on ULP, coordinate with projects  Austin Green: technical and security expertise  Michael Silberling: create Dune Analytics dashboards that help us monitor the effectiveness of the liquidity program and enable us make changes when needed  Oversight Committee Members:  Eva Beylin, Graph Protocol Jon Itzler, Variant Fund Arr00, Core Compound community contributor  Implementation: UNI is distributed to LPs that provide in-range liquidity, with those that concentrate their liquidity closer to the market price (i.e. higher virtual liquidity) receiving larger allocations.

Initial Proposed Reward Distribution Across Initiatives: Stablecoin pairs: We suggest an initial stablecoin/stablecoin liquidity mining program over the course of the next three months conservatively targeting $250m in each of the following pools:  USDC/DAI [0.05% fee tier] USDC/USDT [0.05% fee tier] DAI/USDT [0.05% fee tier]  A reward rate of 2% APY feels like an appropriate target for stablecoin/stablecoin pools as v3 stablecoin/stablecoin pools are already generating organic yields in-line with money market protocols. Based on a 30D moving average UNI price of $20.06, the committee would distribute 741.82 UNI per day to each of the three pools listed above for a total of 186,939 UNI across all three pools over the next quarter. Mid-tail pairs We suggest an initial mid-tail pair liquidity mining program over the course of the next quarter. We are conservatively targeting $100m in each of the following pools:  LINK/ETH [0.30% fee tier] YFI/ETH [0.30% fee tier] MKR/ETH [0.30% fee tier] AAVE/ETH [0.30% fee tier] COMP/ETH [0.30% fee tier]  A reward rate of 10% APY feels appropriate for mid-tail pair pools. Compared to stablecoin/stablecoin pools, LPs in mid-tail pairs must bear more price risk. Based on the 30D moving average UNI price of $20.06, 1,483.64 UNI per day to each of the five pools listed above for a total of 623,130.61 UNI across all five pools over the next quarter. Deposit Receipt Tokens (DRT): We suggest an initial DRT liquidity mining program over the course of the next quarter. Due to Uniswap\u2019s brand recognition and gas optimized contracts, deeply liquid DRT pools may serve as an effective alternative distribution channel for yield-generating platforms. We are conservatively targeting $10m in each of the following pools:  DAI/cDAI [0.05% fee tier] [Compound] ETH/wstETH [0.05% fee tier] [Lido] USDC/PcUSDC [0.05% fee tier] [PoolTogether]  As with stablecoin/stablecoin pools, LPs in DRT pairs take on minimal price risk. Additionally, they earn passive yield by maintaining inventories of yield-bearing assets. A reward rate of 4% feels appropriate. Based on the 30D moving average UNI price of $20.06, the committee would distribute 59.34 UNI per day to each of the threepools listed above for a total of 16,021.8UNI across all three pools over the next quarter. Conclusion: We recommend the establishment of a Uniswap Liquidity Program (ULP), which will actively incentivize liquidity across three strategic categories:  Stablecoin/stablecoin pairs Mid-tail pairs Depositary receipt pairs  ULP will exist as a 8-person committee with 5 core members, where core committee members are tasked with closely monitoring the success of ongoing programs and frequently updating the Uniswap community via regular written reports. The 3 oversight members are responsible for monitoring the core committee and multisig signing. We believe that the targeted nature of ULP\u2019s proposals coupled with Uniswap\u2019s organic user base will help achieve various objectives: wider LP participation, more liquidity across sought-after pairs, further UNI distribution, and increasing swap volume.

                    "content": "Gauntlet has been considering the merits of this proposal and we wanted to share our initial analysis of the stated goals. Accelerating the migration of liquidity to Uniswap v3 This goal risks distorting the market by causing people to enter significantly riskier and more complex positions through incentives. Impermanent loss is magnified through V3 and V3 incentives may induce people unable to tolerate that risk to enter an investment vehicle they don\u2019t understand. Both V2 and V3 have a place in the DeFi space, if V3 was monotonically better than V2 more of the liquidity would have migrated over already. With that said, V3 is much more efficient in drawing volume per unit of capital (~3x more efficient). It is in Uniswap\u2019s best interest to compensate LPs for this risk through incentives to draw in more liquidity since this in turn will be better utilized at drawing in volume versus leaving it in V2. The framing of this as a simple migration is inadequate, it\u2019s compensating LPs for the new risk from migration. Strong consideration should be given to the possibility that when incentives are removed LPs will migrate back to V2. Encouraging new market participants to experiment with liquidity provision Providing subsidized returns to convince HODLers to start experimenting with DeFi is a good idea. This grows the overall pie of capital that can be utilized in the DeFi space. Further distributing ownership of UNI tokens Most of the rewards will be concentrated among certain whale LPs so it is dubious how much true distribution this will lead to. Supporting ecosystem growth It is unclear how this differentiates from the first two points. Overall The proposal broadly makes sense although the function for how rewards are distributed is under-explained and analyzed: UNI is distributed to LPs that provide in-range liquidity, with those that concentrate their liquidity closer to the market price (i.e. higher virtual liquidity) receiving larger allocations. Based on this Gauntlet\u2019s preliminary analysis suggests the vast majority of the rewards will go to pre-existing LPs who can actively manage and concentrate their liquidity. The passive LPs who they hope will migrate from V2, other protocols, and HODLers are likely to earn very little as their liquidity will be concentrated meaning much of the incentive will be effectively wasted. On the flip side, incentivizing all liquidity equally is suboptimal since it can be easily gamed by moving your liquidity to non-useful positions. This is a non-trivial problem to solve. Disclosures Besides acting as a delegate for Uniswap, Gauntlet has active engagements with Sushiswap and Balancer where our platform is used by those core teams and communities to inform token emissions and trading fees.* ",

                    "content": "Authors: Jon Itzler (Variant), Shreyas Hariharan and AG (Llama) Updates:  The multi-sig has been changed to a 4 of 5 multi-sig, with 2 members of LlamaDAO and 3 members from the oversight committee. This was previously a 5 of 6 multi-sig with 3 members from Llama. In order to provide sufficient oversight, it makes sense for the multi-sig to be in the control over the oversight members instead of having equal representation from Llama. We would like to emphasize that the payment of $150/hour for up to 30 hours a week goes to all Llama members. This is not the rate per Llama member. There was some confusion on this point in previous posts so we wanted to clarify it upfront. We plan to post the on-chain proposal on August 31. We hope to get as much community feedback as possible over the next week before we post the on-chain proposal, so that the on-chain vote has already built consensus. So far, we have sought community feedback in our temperature check proposal, consensus check proposal, Snapshot vote, and hosted a Twitter spaces discussion to answer questions about ULP. The Snapshot vote was overwhelmingly positive (99%+ for votes) and we have incorporated feedback from each of our proposal discussions in the final proposal. We have already built a Uniswap v3 Liquidity Program Dune dashboard to track the effectiveness of ULP. (Shoutout to Michael from Llama.)  Summary: This proposal outlines a framework for establishing a liquidity incentives program (Uniswap Liquidity Program, ULP) with the goals of: accelerating the migration of liquidity to Uniswap v3; encouraging new market participants to experiment with liquidity provision, further distributing ownership of UNI tokens, and supporting ecosystem growth over the long-term. We propose the program start with an initial maximum budget of 1.662m UNI, to be allocated as liquidity incentives across two quarters. Continuation of the program will require an additional governance vote. Upon renewal of the program, each of the three initiatives can be broken out into separate proposals. The program will aim to bootstrap liquidity across three different initiatives:  Stablecoin pairs Mid-tail pairs (e.g DeFi governance tokens) Deposit receipt tokens (i.e. cTokens, aTokens) Similarly to the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP), pair selection is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated: any action requires close monitoring and frequent reporting to the Uniswap community. To this end, we propose a discretionary committee of 8 members \u2014 5 core members from LlamaDAO to actively lead & manage the committee, as well 3 members for oversight. Find LlamaDAO\u2019s full proposal & management plan detailed here.  The committee structure allows for incentives to be allocated efficiently across many pairs without requiring a full governance vote on each pair selection. However, Uniswap governance retains ultimate oversight by granting a budget on a bi-quarterly basis. Purpose & Background: While Uniswap v3 has quickly emerged as the market leading DEX, we believe that it has yet to reach its full potential. In particular, large amounts of liquidity remain locked in Uniswap v2, and a majority of v2 LPs have yet to migrate over the v3. Liquidity incentive programs have seen varying degrees of success. In Uniswap\u2019s case, the initial liquidity incentive program between September\u2014November 2020 was met with considerable interest:  Protocol liquidity quickly increased from ~$750M in the week preceding the program to ~$3B at peak. The number of individual addresses holding more than 0 LP tokens increased by ~75% from ~33,500 to ~59,000. The unique UNI token holder base grew by 14% over the course of 2 months.  A contributing factor here is that Uniswap v2 has an organic user-base, which drives organic swap yields to LPs. We expect and hope that a liquidity incentives program on Uniswap v3 would succeed in increasing wider LP participation, liquidity across sought-after pairs, UNI distribution, and swap volume. Importantly, due to v3\u2019s Concentrated Liquidity feature, Uniswap governance can afford to pay significantly lower reward rates than previous liquidity mining programs to achieve similar market depth. Quarterly Budget:  Max quarterly budget of up to 826,091 UNI across all initiatives to start In addition to the quarterly budget, LlamaDAO (core committee members) is to be collectively compensated at a rate of $150 per hour up to 30 hours a week. Each month, oversight members will be responsible for calculating exchange rate from UNI to USD and appropriate payouts (estimated at ~2917 UNI per quarter), with payments being made in UNI. Oversight members will be compensated at a rate of 300 UNI per quarter.  Pair Selection Committee:  5 core committee members, composed of LlamaDAO team members for the first term, as well as 3 oversight committee members. Each committee has a term of 2 quarters (6 months) after which the program and members need to be renewed by UNI governance. Committee functions as a 4 of 5 multi-sig, with 2 members of LlamaDAO and 3 members from the oversight committee. Committee to share a weekly report detailing the decision making process (using a standard template) and periodic updates detailing the successes and failures of the program.  Committee Members: Committee member criteria include:  Credibly neutral \u2014 need to avoid any sense of conflict of interest Ability to evaluate fundamental strengths of projects and their place in the ecosystem Data driven \u2014 capable of assessing quantitative merits/growth signals  Committee members must recuse themselves from any ULP decision related to a project they hold an investment in or are otherwise related to. Core Committee Members (LlamaDAO):   AG: project management and evaluation  Shreyas Hariharan: project management, coordinate with Uniswap governance and stakeholders  Mason: project management, create progress reports on ULP, coordinate with projects  Austin Green: technical and security expertise  Michael Silberling: create Dune Analytics dashboards that help us monitor the effectiveness of the liquidity program and enable us make changes when needed  Oversight Committee Members:   Eva Beylin, Graph Protocol  Jon Itzler, Variant Fund  Arr00, Core Compound community contributor  Implementation: UNI is distributed to LPs that provide in-range liquidity, with those that concentrate their liquidity closer to the market price (i.e. higher virtual liquidity) receiving larger allocations.

Initial Proposed Reward Distribution Across Initiatives: Stablecoin pairs We suggest an initial stablecoin/stablecoin liquidity mining program over the course of the next three months conservatively targeting $250m in each of the following pools:  USDC/DAI [0.05% fee tier] USDC/USDT [0.05% fee tier] DAI/USDT [0.05% fee tier]  A reward rate of 2% APY feels like an appropriate target for stablecoin/stablecoin pools as v3 stablecoin/stablecoin pools are already generating organic yields in-line with money market protocols. The committee would distribute 741.82 UNI per day to each of the three pools listed above for a total of 186,939 UNI across all three pools over the next quarter. Mid-tail pairs We suggest an initial mid-tail pair liquidity mining program over the course of the next quarter. We are conservatively targeting $100m in each of the following pools:  LINK/ETH [0.30% fee tier] YFI/ETH  [0.30% fee tier] MKR/ETH  [0.30% fee tier] AAVE/ETH  [0.30% fee tier] COMP/ETH  [0.30% fee tier]  A reward rate of 10% APY feels appropriate for mid-tail pair pools. Compared to stablecoin/stablecoin pools, LPs in mid-tail pairs must bear more price risk. The committee would distribute 1,483.64 UNI per day to each of the five pools listed above for a total of 623,130.61 UNI across all five pools over the next quarter. Deposit Receipt Tokens (DRT) We suggest an initial DRT liquidity mining program over the course of the next quarter. Due to Uniswap\u2019s brand recognition and gas optimized contracts, deeply liquid DRT pools may serve as an effective alternative distribution channel for yield-generating platforms. We are conservatively targeting $10m in each of the following pools:  DAI/cDAI [0.05% fee tier] [Compound] ETH/wstETH [0.05% fee tier] [Lido] USDC/PcUSDC [0.05% fee tier] [PoolTogether]  As with stablecoin/stablecoin pools, LPs in DRT pairs take on minimal price risk. Additionally, they earn passive yield by maintaining inventories of yield-bearing assets. A reward rate of 4% feels appropriate. The committee would distribute 59.34 UNI per day to each of the three pools listed above for a total of 16,021.8 UNI across all three pools over the next quarter. Conclusion: We recommend the establishment of a Uniswap Liquidity Program (ULP), which will actively incentivize liquidity across three strategic categories:  Stablecoin/stablecoin pairs Mid-tail pairs Depositary receipt pairs  ULP will exist as a 8-person committee with 5 core members, where core committee members are tasked with closely monitoring the success of ongoing programs and frequently updating the Uniswap community via regular written reports. The 3 oversight members are responsible for monitoring the core committee and multisig signing. We believe that the targeted nature of ULP\u2019s proposals coupled with Uniswap\u2019s organic user base will help achieve various objectives: wider LP participation, more liquidity across sought-after pairs, further UNI distribution, and increasing swap volume.

However, I\u2019m left wondering if a centralized committee structure is actually the ideal setup.     HelloShreyas:  The committee structure allows for incentives to be allocated efficiently across many pairs without requiring a full governance vote on each pair selection.   It seems we\u2019re taking it as a given that centralized decision making is the optimal way to distribute a considerable amount of treasury funds, which seems at least a wasted opportunity in governance experimentation. ULP and other programs would be setting an important precedent for how we want to decide on the use of the treasury, we should see these as opportunities to consider what tools could be built to make governance voting and decentralized decision making more efficient, and not just surrender to centralized committees as the default choice.

Given V3 leverages concentrated liquidity, should we be focusing on driving more liquidity or more integrations / volume? In other words, what\u2019s the relative value of liquidity mining at this stage versus allocating more budget to grants for integrations / co-marketing?  Both the liquidity program and integrations are complementary, not mutually exclusive. Getting each of the pools to the target liquidity we have set ($250m in stable pools, $100m in mid-tail pools, and $10m in DRT pools) would be a good first step for other initiatives.  It feels obvious that we should wait to do any liquidity incentives until Uniswap deploys on Arbitrum and / or Optimism to drive liquidity to those pools.  Including Optimism/Arbitrum is definitely an idea we are interested in as the program evolves. These ecosystems are young and it\u2019s best to let Uniswap grow on L2s before adding liquidity incentives. This program focuses on bringing v3 liquidity on L1, which will be important for L2 liquidity as well.  How will we measure success over time?  We are primarily evaluating migration of liquidity to v3. Here are some items we are tracking on our Dune dashboard:  Is incentivizing v3 liquidity providing a better trader experience on v3?  Swap Performance: Share of trades where v3 has the best price (DEX aggregators as a proxy), and price impact trends for incentivized pairs. Benchmark Growth: Share of trades and trading volume for incentivized pairs on v3 vs v2 and other DEXs   Is the liquidity program creating deeper v3 liquidity versus v2?  Liquidity Depth: Monitor total TVL and in-range liquidity for incentivized pairs, and volume of active LPs. New v3 Liquidity: Track v2 liquidity migration to v3 in incentivized pairs, and compare new liquidity going to v3 vs v2.   LP Retention: Track how many users are LPing, how many are new vs returning LPs, and LP cohort retention.  Do we have the right rewards structure in place? What can we learn? UNI Reward Structure: Change in TVL and in-range liquidity by UNI incentive tier. External Rewards: Change in TVL and in-range liquidity for pairs with multiple incentives (i.e. native token liquidity mining, staking), and/or incentives on other DEXs.    ",

Instead of a \u201cPair Selection committee\u201d with an initial proposed distribution selected by some criteria never explained, we make the criteria for selecting pools explicit and codify the rules in english, like we would for the construction of an index fund. An index of pools is created following the specified rules, and the index is updated every determined period. The quarterly budget is distributed among the pools in this index also following some explicitly defined rules. Surely you can see how the distribution of several million dollars from the treasury can be problematic when done arbitrarily by any selected committee, and that we should strive to minimize this when possible.

                    "content": "We at a16z would like to thank LlamaDAO for their hard work on this proposal. After analyzing the proposal, we don\u2019t think that the benefits of the proposal outweigh the cost of ~$50M in payments to LPs for the following reasons:  Uniswap v3 already has dominant DEX market share on Ethereum layer 1 without incentives. A better use for liquidity mining would be incentivizing liquidity provision on layer 2 chains. There are issues with the pairs chosen for incentivization.  Given these reasons, a16z does not support the proposal in its current form. We explore each of the aforementioned points in greater detail below: Uniswap v3 already has dominant DEX market share on Ethereum layer 1 without incentives. Uniswap v3 alone already has >50% DEX market share on Ethereum layer 1. Furthermore, it already has deep liquidity with over $2.9B in value locked.  image1382\u00d7572 64 KB  While there is more capital currently locked in v2, it\u2019s not clear that the benefits of adding more liquidity to v3 will exceed the cost of the program, especially since v3 allows for much greater capital efficiency than v2 by design. A better use for liquidity mining would be incentivizing liquidity provision on layer 2 chains. The most pressing problem for Uniswap v3 on Ethereum layer 1 is not the depth of its pools but rather the cost of interacting with it. The median gas cost of trading through the v3 swapRouter contract over the last 7 days is 160K, which is ~$60 per swap at prevailing gas prices of ~100 gwei. The most effective thing the Uniswap community could do in the short term is migrate to more scalable layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism.** Liquidity mining is most effective when it\u2019s used to \u201cjump-start\u201d network effects in a nascent ecosystem. In Uniswap\u2019s case, a jump-start for liquidity could encourage trading and integrations from applications that require external liquidity. Taker demand and integrations could encourage more folks to provide liquidity to earn trading fees, which in turn could encourage more integrations, and so on. This \u201cflywheel\u201d effect has played out to some extent on Ethereum layer 1 already, but has yet to be sparked for layer 2 deployments. Liquidity mining incentives on these chains could be a helpful jump-start. There are issues with the pairs chosen for incentivization. \u201cDeposit Receipt Tokens\u201d are not a promising DEX market. Redemption of these tokens from the protocols themselves (e.g. Compound) would potentially be more straightforward and less costly (avoiding slippage and a 5 bp fee). Furthermore, COMP rewards accruing to the cDAI in the DAI-cDAI market would be forfeited. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that a relatively small portion of incentives (~2%) will be going toward these pairs. Incentivizing 5 bps stablecoin pairs won\u2019t necessarily make Uniswap v3 more competitive. Offering low slippage on stablecoin<>stablecoin pairs is easier due to their low price volatility. As such, the determining factor is trading fees. Pouring more capital into a 5 bps fee pool won\u2019t necessarily make Uniswap v3\u2019s pricing more attractive, as lower cost pools exist such as Curve\u2019s 3pool (3 bps fees) and DODO\u2019s USDC-USDT pool (1 bps fees). Indeed, most USDC-USDT volume from 1inch is routed to DODO. There isn\u2019t a clear quantitative methodology behind identifying the mid tail pairs. The reasoning isn\u2019t clear behind the 5 DeFi governance tokens chosen for incentivization as \u201cmid tail pairs.\u201d One of these tokens, AAVE, is not a great candidate given that liquidity is dominated by a balancer pool that provides users with LP tokens that can be used in AAVE staking. 1inch AAVE-ETH routing is dominated by this pool.  These shortcomings, in conjunction with the high price tag, should encourage the community to look for other ways to address the core purposes fueling the proposal. In light of this analysis we offer a few potential solutions below and welcome the community\u2019s feedback in continuing this dialogue. Looking forward: There could be some lower cost ways for the treasury to incentivize LP migration to v3:  If the problem is high gas cost, the treasury could subsidize a % of gas costs for new LPs. If the problem is lack of awareness and tools, there could be a grant for building better tools and documentation around v3 LPing. There could be a grant to build easy tools for other teams to incentivize liquidity on v3. For example, Fei incentivizes a large pool on Uniswap v2. Understanding these uses and working with teams to incentivize v3 liquidity instead of v2 could be high leverage for UNI holders.  Furthermore, we think using liquidity mining to bootstrap layer 2 deployments could also be a high leverage use of funds. **a16z is an investor in Optimism. ",

I think using liquidity mining for bootstraping layer 2 makes plenty of sense. As a uniswap user, I have not tried layer 2.

                    "content": "Authors: @itzler, @HelloShreyas, @verto0912 Summary: This proposal outlines a framework for establishing a liquidity incentives program (Uniswap Liquidity Program, ULP) with the goals of: accelerating the migration of liquidity to Uniswap v3; encouraging new market participants to experiment with liquidity provision, and further distributing ownership of UNI tokens. We propose the program start with an initial maximum budget of 1.650m UNI, to be allocated as liquidity incentives across two quarters. Continuation of the program will require an additional governance vote. Upon renewal of the program, each of the three initiatives can be broken out into separate proposals. The program will aim to bootstrap liquidity across three different initiatives:  Stablecoin pairs Mid-tail pairs (e.g DeFi governance tokens) Deposit receipt tokens (i.e. cTokens, aTokens)  Similarly to the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP), pair selection is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated: any action requires close monitoring and frequent reporting to the Uniswap community. To this end, we propose a discretionary committee of 8 members \u2014 5 core members from LlamaDAO to actively lead & manage the committee, as well 3 members for oversight. Find LlamaDAO\u2019s full proposal & management plan detailed here. The committee structure allows for incentives to be allocated efficiently across many pairs without requiring a full governance vote on each pair selection. However, Uniswap governance retains ultimate oversight by granting a budget on a bi-quarterly basis. We hope that the Uniswap community will suggest additional application questions throughout the proposal process. Purpose & Background: While Uniswap v3 has quickly emerged as the market leading DEX, we believe that it has yet to reach its full potential. In particular, large amounts of liquidity remain locked in Uniswap v2, and a majority of v2 LPs have yet to migrate over the v3. Liquidity incentive programs have seen varying degrees of success. In Uniswap\u2019s case, the initial liquidity incentive program between September\u2014November 2020 was met with considerable interest:  Protocol liquidity quickly increased from ~$750M in the week preceding the program to ~$3B at peak. The number of individual addresses holding more than 0 LP tokens increased by ~75% from ~33,500 to ~59,000. The unique UNI token holder base grew by 14% over the course of 2 months.  A contributing factor here is that Uniswap v2 has an organic user-base, which drives organic swap yields to LPs. We expect and hope that a liquidity incentives program on Uniswap v3 would succeed in increasing wider LP participation, liquidity across sought-after pairs, UNI distribution, and swap volume. Importantly, due to v3\u2019s Concentrated Liquidity feature, Uniswap governance can afford to pay significantly lower reward rates than previous liquidity mining programs to achieve similar market depth. Quarterly Budget:  Max quarterly budget of up to 820,039 UNI across all initiatives to start In addition to the quarterly budget, LlamaDAO (core committee members) is to be collectively compensated at a rate of $150 per hour up to 30 hours a week. Each month, oversight members will be responsible for calculating exchange rate from UNI to USD and appropriate payouts (estimated at ~2917 UNI per quarter), with payments being made in UNI. Oversight members will be compensated at a rate of 300 UNI per quarter.  Pair Selection Committee:  5 core committee members, composed of LlamaDAO team members for the first term, as well as 3 oversight committee members. Each committee has a term of 2 quarters (6 months) after which the program and members need to be renewed by UNI governance. Committee functions as a 5 of 6 multi-sig, with 3 members of LlamaDAO and 3 members from the oversight committee. Committee to share a weekly report detailing the decision making process (using a standard template) and periodic updates detailing the successes and failures of the program.  Committee Members: Committee member criteria include:  Credibly neutral \u2014 need to avoid any sense of conflict of interest Ability to evaluate fundamental strengths of projects and their place in the ecosystem Data driven \u2014 capable of assessing quantitative merits/growth signals  Committee members must recuse themselves from any ULP decision related to a project they hold an investment in or are otherwise related to. Core Committee Members (LlamaDAO):   AG: project management and evaluation  Shreyas Hariharan: project management, coordinate with Uniswap governance and stakeholders  Mason: project management, create progress reports on ULP, coordinate with projects  Austin Green: technical and security expertise  Kiba Gateaux: technical and governance expertise (DAO tooling, admin keys, multisig wallets)  Oversight Committee Members:  Eva Beylin, Graph Protocol Jon Itzler, Variant Fund Arr00, Core Compound community contributor  Implementation: UNI is distributed to LPs that provide in-range liquidity, with those that concentrate their liquidity closer to the market price (i.e. higher virtual liquidity) receiving larger allocations.

Initial Proposed Reward Distribution Across Initiatives: Stablecoin pairs: We suggest an initial stablecoin/stablecoin liquidity mining program over the course of the next three months conservatively targeting $250m in each of the following pools:  USDC/DAI [0.05% fee tier] USDC/USDT [0.05% fee tier] DAI/USDT [0.05% fee tier]  A reward rate of 2% APY feels like an appropriate target for stablecoin/stablecoin pools as v3 stablecoin/stablecoin pools are already generating organic yields in-line with money market protocols. Based on a 30D moving average UNI price of $20.06, the committee would distribute 741.82 UNI per day to each of the three pools listed above for a total of 186,939 UNI across all three pools over the next quarter. Mid-tail pairs We suggest an initial mid-tail pair liquidity mining program over the course of the next quarter. We are conservatively targeting $100m in each of the following pools:  LINK/ETH [0.30% fee tier] YFI/ETH [0.30% fee tier] MKR/ETH [0.30% fee tier] AAVE/ETH [0.30% fee tier] COMP/ETH [0.30% fee tier]  A reward rate of 10% APY feels appropriate for mid-tail pair pools. Compared to stablecoin/stablecoin pools, LPs in mid-tail pairs must bear more price risk. Based on the 30D moving average UNI price of $20.06, 1,483.64 UNI per day to each of the five pools listed above for a total of 623,130.61 UNI across all five pools over the next quarter. Deposit Receipt Tokens (DRT) We suggest an initial DRT liquidity mining program over the course of the next quarter. Due to Uniswap\u2019s brand recognition and gas optimized contracts, deeply liquid DRT pools may serve as an effective alternative distribution channel for yield-generating platforms. We are conservatively targeting $10m in each of the following pools:  DAI/cDAI [0.05% fee tier] [Compound] USDC/aUSDC [0.05% fee tier] [Aave] ETH/wstETH [0.05% fee tier] [Lido] USDC/PcUSDC [0.05% fee tier] [PoolTogether]  As with stablecoin/stablecoin pools, LPs in DRT pairs take on minimal price risk. Additionally, they earn passive yield by maintaining inventories of yield-bearing assets. A reward rate of 2% feels appropriate. Based on the 30D moving average UNI price of $20.06, the committee would distribute 29.67 UNI per day to each of the four pools listed above for a total of 9,970.09 UNI across all four pools over the next quarter. Conclusion: We recommend the establishment of a Uniswap Liquidity Program (ULP), which will actively incentivize liquidity across three strategic categories:  Stablecoin/stablecoin pairs Mid-tail pairs Depositary receipt pairs  ULP will exist as a 8-person committee with 5 core members, where core committee members are tasked with closely monitoring ongoing programs and frequently updating the Uniswap community via regular written reports. The 3 oversight members are responsible for monitoring the core committee and multisig signing. We believe that the targeted nature of ULP\u2019s proposals coupled with Uniswap\u2019s organic user base will help achieve various objectives: wider LP participation, more liquidity across sought-after pairs, further UNI distribution, and increasing swap volume. Next Steps: We want the establishment of ULP to be a community-driven process. We actively seek questions and feedback from the Uniswap community over the next 5 days and hope to incorporate relevant points. After this, we will post this proposal for a vote on Snapshot before an on-chain vote. ",

I personally hope this proposal will soon be further adjusted, voted on and be implemented - incl. varying incentives for Optimism experimentation. A few comments     HelloShreyas:  We expect and hope that a liquidity incentives program on Uniswap v3 would succeed in increasing wider LP participation, liquidity across sought-after pairs, UNI distribution, and swap volume.   In our opinion, a liquidity mining campaign for a DEX should mainly achieve   additional swap volume vs. competition (focus especially on trades routed towards Uniswap, not directly on Uniswap)   knowledge increase (e.g. experiment with 2-6 week incentive cycles)   Marketing exposure (e.g. co-campaigns with DeFi protocols, Optimism, etc.)   Encouragement of new token buyers and LPs was well done at the start and is an effective way to bootstrap a network. At this stage, there are better options to broaden the investor base and to educate newcomers about LPing (Guides, Videos, Test Environment/Competition). In fact, the liquidity mining campaign on majors will rather lead to more concentration since pros will farm with disproportionally more funds than newcomers. The LP base will broaden with 3rd party projects offering automated LP vaults - another interesting option for Uni treasury investment.     HelloShreyas:  The program will aim to bootstrap liquidity across three different initiatives:  Stablecoin pairs Mid-tail pairs (e.g DeFi governance tokens) Deposit receipt tokens (i.e. cTokens, aTokens)    Agreed, these target pairs are most interesting for V3. I am especially curious on cToken and aToken liquidity and opening up more use cases - is a collaboration with Compound/Aave being discussed? Targeting $100m in each of the DeFi-ETH pools seems excessive. I have serious doubts about swaps requiring such deep liquidity pools but would be happy proven otherwise.     HelloShreyas:  Committee member criteria include:  Credibly neutral \u2014 need to avoid any sense of conflict of interest Ability to evaluate fundamental strengths of projects and their place in the ecosystem Data driven \u2014 capable of assessing quantitative merits/growth signals    Commitee setup looks very strong and compensation fair. I do believe long-term investors from Paradigm and core developers should also have a seat at the table as they have most certainly thought a lot about important pairs and pair incentivization. Again, thanks for the good proposal. ",

I\u2019m quite doubtful that the size of proposed UNI distributed would achieve to accelerate the migration of liquidity to V3. Selective pair liquidity mining is not a fair approach to other token pairs left in the dust. V2 liquidity for mid-tail pairs not mentioned will most likely remain to stay locked in V2 without UNI incentives. Has there been studies on the migration of liquidity from other DeFi projects?

Our primary motivation for migrating liquidity to v3 is that concentrated liquidity should provide better pricing for swappers, which leads to a better swapper experience. While I definitely agree that there\u2019s a set of users (including me) who would prefer a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d LP model, there\u2019s a challenge of how to balance the best LP experience with the best swapper experience. We\u2019ll be monitoring performance of incentivized pairs to learn if these incentives are creating a better swapper experience or not. For \u201cset it and forget it\u201d options, LPs could provide an ~infinite range on v3 today, but that might not generate reasonable revenue or improve the swapper experience. They could also explore automated managers, who should be able to both generate fees and provide better trade pricing. We\u2019d hope that anyone building to improve the LP experience should benefit from the extra incentives. On mid-tail pairs, we started with what we (subjectively) perceived to have a high impact for v3, rather than incentivizing every mid-tail pair, but definitely let us know if you have suggested additions. Also, it\u2019s worth noting that this is the initial program, so it could expand over time if the community sees enough benefit to. ",

I think it\u2019s a very important thing to introduce users to what LP\u2019ing is and how it works. One piece of feedback: The stated goals of the program are:   migration of liquidity to v3, 2. new market participants to experiment with LPing, 3. further distribution of UNI ownership.   Those are great but I think another very important goal is supporting the Ethereum ecosystem. Providing liquidity incentives to token pairs naturally does this but I think it should be made an explicit goal. This may be out of scope but longer term I think there should be an additional category of \u201cecosystem growth\u201d. Ideal candidates for this would be promising token projects built on Ethereum but not yet trading on any Cexs. The issue is placement in this program could become highly political but I think Uniswap being active in supporting early stage projects would mean a lot to those communities \u2013 you never forget your first supporters! tl;dr liquidity mining is a big win to the whole community and that should be an explicit goal / narrative of the program.

Benchmark Growth: Share of trades and trading volume for incentivized pairs on v3 vs v2 and other DEXs   Is the liquidity program creating deeper v3 liquidity versus v2?  Liquidity Depth: Monitor total TVL and in-range liquidity for incentivized pairs, and volume of active LPs. New v3 Liquidity: Track v2 liquidity migration to v3 in incentivized pairs, and compare new liquidity going to v3 vs v2. LP Retention: Track how many users are LPing, how many are new vs returning LPs, and LP cohort retention.   Do we have the right rewards structure in place? What can we learn?  UNI Reward Structure: Change in TVL and in-range liquidity by UNI incentive tier. External Rewards: Change in TVL and in-range liquidity for pairs with multiple incentives (i.e. native token liquidity mining, staking), and/or incentives on other DEXs.    Re.

We aimed to select the starting set of pairs with this in mind. As the program evolves, it has the potential to add an additional mandate of incentivizing emerging public goods that fall within the initiatives - new stablecoins, additional receipt tokens, etc. Considering & proposing pairs like these to select as additions would be part of Llama\u2019s mandate. We made the decision to start the proposal out with limited scope on this particular set & let it prove success first, but the flexibility of the committee structure means that this idea could definitely be within scope over the longer term.

I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have other questions, but my first is just around the work from the committee. I believe the $150/hr compensation is a fair rate for this kind of specialized work, but I have a question on the weekly hour limit for this committee. The 30 hour/week limit per person is obviously the same limit for the UGP committee, but there are more members of this committee, and I\u2019m curious how the amount of work stacks up. Do you believe the amount of weekly work for this program will be equivalent to something like UGP, where there\u2019s (at least to me) more obvious human hours required week in and week out to keep the project going? My intuition would be that it might be good to have a lower cap on hours per person, or a team-wide hour cap that comes out to where we think weekly work will hit a plateau in terms of marginal utility. Curious to hear thoughts! @HelloShreyas, I see your post above on the dashboard creation and documentation to be done, and I suppose my question is if you think that kind of work could possible add up to 5 people * 30 hours per week.

This proposal is missing that piece as well. Overall I dont think Uniswap in particular benefits from a Committee to manage liquidity incentives, but would perhaps give it more thought if the group was diversified a little better. I\u2019m not sure a committee made up of mainly LlamaDAO members can adequately represent the Greater DeFi Ecosystem, and the exemption of SNX among the selected Defi gov tokens is an example of that. I have no issue with the LlamaDAO members individually, however this proposal misses the mark for me in its current form.  SNX Ambassador  ",

I think the more we incentivize people to keep their uni tokens, the more we incentivize them to stay on the Uniswap platform while also increasing decentralization. Would love to hear thoughts on this. Other thoughts: The general defi public has yet to realize the earnings potential for v3 positions even with 0 incentives.

I was around for initial Uni Liquidity mining and also minted one of the first 500 v3 positions. I remember each time with excitement and trepidation and believe that a renewed liquidity mining program on v3 would not only accomplish the stated goals of bringing increased v3 liquidity, but also bring new users to the protocol. As for the pairs mentioned, we can certainly explore the inclusion of SNX in the initial program if there is support from the Uni community for it. If it doesn\u2019t make it in the first round it can also be part of our phased approach and be incentivized later if the Uni community deems the program to be effective ",

Regarding the statement that we don\u2019t really need these incentives since v3 is already dominating the LP game, would it make sense that we plan to flip the v3 fee switch in addition to providing these LP incentives (after at least one layer 2 roll up is fully open)? I know we have proposal to flip the v2 fee switch, but if UNI members would like to see UNI token holders\u2019 incentives as well as LP\u2019s incentives fully align, a low fee v3 switch could be the answer. Without token holders and/or the treasury benefiting, we are potentially wasting some of the value for LP incentives.

First of all lets go over what you are proposing: First of the goals you mention is:     HelloShreyas:  accelerating the migration of liquidity to Uniswap v3   Immediately you follow with suggesting subsidising these pairs:     HelloShreyas:   USDC/DAI [0.05% fee tier] USDC/USDT [0.05% fee tier] DAI/USDT [0.05% fee tier]    Lets look at first pair *v3 USDC/DAI 0.05% TVL is $118m compared to v2 which only $21m (so here it seems you completely ignore the market, and forces that move it, the lower fee offers better rate for end users and increases trading volume, and hence is natural migration for efficient capital, if we compare last 24h volume its $116k on v2 vs $7.29m (x62 difference), adjust it for 6x difference in fees (0.3 vs 0.05) and 5.6x difference in volume, we get that v3 gives LP an almost x2 ROI, and im deliberately leaving out all the benefits and earnings adjustments of concentrated liquidity Not sure there is any point of going over every pair as what you are here are proposing: is to provide you with funds for exactly this core capability of choosing what pools to incentive + some periphery tooling, like dune, etc (for the latter I suggest applying to Uniswap grants could be more suitable) So at this point I wouldn\u2019t even consider with voting to provide you with budget to allocate treasury funds for allocation between pools Furthermore your suggested weekly rate, which is exactly the same as recent one requested by uniswap grants team, adds even more concerns to me, because I don\u2019t understand how different size team, with different set of capabilities, responsibilities, challenges, etc could be cost the same Lastly I would like to finish where I started is why I think this proposal is utterly boring, I do agree with where you guys are coming from, making a good use of treasury and really feel these two goals you have set out in your proposal:     HelloShreyas:  encouraging new market participants to experiment with liquidity provision, and further distributing ownership of UNI tokens   and that\u2019s why I completely not getting how is this experimental at all, its just basically the same old farming or what it called, that has been in the market for quite some time and personally I don\u2019t think in your proposed suggestion solves further distributing ownership of UNI tokens or experimental, hence boring. What I would like to see, and would gladly vote for is some innovative ideas, i got couple just while reading this thread and writing a reply:  Something like with partnership with unigrants we bootstrap any project/community approved by them with liquidity for their token pairs on v3 We provide UNI/ETH pools with 1m of UNI liquidity incentives, just cause they didn\u2019t get their fees (around $30k) from the defifund dump the other day due some weird reasoning behind it make idea 1 into a proper dapp  Just to finish, as I have said I feel that I share many of the goals you have outlined here and understand where you coming from, but I simply think the proposal doesn\u2019t solve the problem, hence I will be voting against it, if it comes to the vote, agains thanks for your effort and time!

I\u2019m Austin, one of the core committee members from Llama.     wijuwiju:  Not sure there is any point of going over every pair as what you are here are proposing: is to provide you with funds for exactly this core capability of choosing what pools to incentive + some periphery tooling, like dune, etc (for the latter I suggest applying to Uniswap grants could be more suitable)   This proposal is very much the beginning of the Uniswap Liquidity Program (v0.1). We want to ensure the community starts with a strong foundation and is able to adapt as we see the market response through a data-driven lens. Migrating liquidity is just one of the stated goals of our proposal. We also aim to encourage new participants to experiment with LPing and further diversify the UNI token holder base. We believe that incentivizing stablecoin pairs will be a big driver for the latter two goals.     wijuwiju:  Furthermore your suggested weekly rate, which is exactly the same as recent one requested by uniswap grants team, adds even more concerns to me, because I don\u2019t understand how different size team, with different set of capabilities, responsibilities, challenges, etc could be cost the same   Given the experience of the committee and the unique skill set required to implement a comprehensive liquidity program, we believe $150/hr is quite a fair rate. I\u2019m sure most of the committee members are used to being paid much more for their work. The 30 hour aggregate weekly limit means the community will only be paying a max of $4,500 a week for all the manual effort required to help the community manage a liquidity program. Pair selection is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated: any action requires close monitoring and frequent reporting to the Uniswap community. We take this job seriously and are committed to providing weekly updates to ensure the committee is more than justifying the cost of their work.     wijuwiju:  We provide UNI/ETH pools with 1m of UNI liquidity incentives   UNI holders are already highly incentivized to expedite the migration of liquidity to v3, so we figure it will be a better use of funds to start with these pairs.     wijuwiju:  Just to finish, as I have said I feel that I share many of the goals you have outlined here and understand where you coming from, but I simply think the proposal doesn\u2019t solve the problem, hence I will be voting against it, if it comes to the vote, agains thanks for your effort and time!   We\u2019re happy to hear that you share the same goals as us. This proposal is just the beginning of what the Uniswap liquidity program can be. As the program evolves, there is the potential to have a process to add new pairs to this list. Uniswap is a rapidly growing protocol and we think beginning with these selected pairs will maximize our chances to grow with it. ",

The only solution I can think of is wrapping but that creates a lot of headaches and I think is detrimental to the main goal (i.e. \u201cpools may serve as an effective alternative distribution channel for yield-generating platforms.\u201d). Wrapping would be better for the LPs but much worse for the people swapping. So I think the current suggested approach is best. At least for PoolTogether it will provide a meaningfully better experience vs. depositing directly (saves 100k gas). The LPs miss out on the Aave / COMP / POOL tokens but are compensated by getting the UNI tokens. And the Uniswap protocol gets to pilot demand for direct swapping into protocol tokens rather than using protocol UIs\u2026 which I think is a really good strategy for Uniswap. ",

It makes sense to have a research based DAO to help with informing the community on key pairs to be focused on to keep Uniswap competitive with other AMM\u2019s and itself (v1 & v2). I few concerns I have is that the treasury has mostly been spent so far on proposals that increase supply of UNI into the market, such as: UGP winners selling UNI to market, DeFi Education Fund selling $10 million usd worth of UNI. If this proposal passes we will mostly see participants who are coming for the APY in UNI rather than an interest in governance, which again will be more selling into a fragile market. I overall am in support of this proposal, but I do think a UI should be built to encourage more governance participation in what pools are selected for further liquidity programs (supplemented by research done by Llama DAO), and a mindful awareness that UNI token itself losses all value as a governance, and treasury if it has little value.

It\u2019s all fun and games in the beginning when nobody knows about the protocol, we attract liquidity (of course we do, we\u2019re giving LPs free \u201cmoney\u201d). But then how quickly it becomes a slippery slope. Like a drug, basically. We have no choice but to keep distributing rewards and incentives because if we stop, a competitor will come in who will and liquidity is going to migrate to them. Our LPs are addicted. It\u2019s already the case with SushiSwap and others on other chains. And more protocols will be created in the future because everything is open source and forkable and despite what we might think liquidity has very little network effects. Liquidity in DeFi is a mercenary, it will go where it\u2019ll make the most money because there is no switching cost. All this at the detriment, of course, of UNI holders. Case in point, the CRV token, where they are basically printing an unlimited amount of rewards just to try to keep liquidity there. As a consequence the price of CRV just keeps tanking and this despite basically CRV being completely useless outside of staking which is another artificial mechanism created to try to keep people from dumping it. Liquidity providers there are slowly realizing that they are being paid rewards in a token whose value keeps declining so they\u2019re incentivized to sell it as soon as they receive it, which puts further sell pressure on price. It\u2019s a vicious circle. Liquidity mining was never anything more than a financial hack. Perhaps, in the very early days of a protocol, it has value in attracting capital. But it cannot be used all the time. When does it stop? There is no proof that liquidity mining attracts long term capital. At best, it attracts capital while rewards are running and most of that capital will flee elsewhere when the rewards stop. We need a better strategy. We need to think long term. Liquidity mining is very short term thinking. Synthetix lives on liquidity mining and today exists as little more than a zombie protocol. They have an average of 42 trades per day over the past 30 days (!). Can you believe it? See for yourself on their stats site. The fact that they are valued at $1.8B is nothing more than financial hackery that is common in crypto (Cardano, anyone?). They have still not found product-market fit. Uniswap, on the other hand, probably has. We don\u2019t need financial hackery schemes. It dilutes UNI holders but most of all it dilutes the brand and arguably the brand is one of the only sustainable competitive advantages we have against up and coming protocols. If LPs aren\u2019t migrating organically from v2 to v3, then there\u2019s a deeper problem that a few UNI rewards won\u2019t solve, at least not in the long run. Perhaps they don\u2019t want to actively manage their liquidity, which they\u2019ll have to do in v3. Perhaps the solution then would be to create liquidity management tools to help them do that. Rewards are not the solution. I am disappointed in this proposal. It highlights the major problem of protocol governance more generally. Short term solutions will sometimes prevail at the detriment of longer term sustainable solutions. This is not a problem we\u2019d have if governance was in the hands of a small founding team who think about Uniswap 24/7. Arguably given the amount of votes Hayden & co control, it still is, which is a good thing, in which case what we have is simply the illusion of governance. Food for thought. ",

Since in v3 liquidity tokens are NFTs, it would make sense to introduce a square root of time  modifier to fee calculation, making the default fees (slightly) lower and growing to current levels and (slightly) beyond as time goes on. This would incentivise LPs to hold their liquidity pool on Uniswap, as they would loose the higher fees accrued. It can also make these NFT positions a desirable commodity traded as they are, rather than cashed in reducing liquidity. The prices for such \u201ccharged\u201d tokens can be higher than the value of the assets they represent as an investor will buy them for future gains. ",

The Tuple value parsed into the createincentive function in Staker.sol (reward token address, pool address, start time, end time, refundee address) somehow keeps throwing me an error when I tried testing on Rinkeby. I have ensured that the start and end time are within the checks of maxincentive duration\u2026 this is my transaction hash: 0xf7579d8ae405a4eced9579a0f1bae80083a1627e8b24e2c8d531861e6fc01aea is the incentive a 1-1 mapping to a particular pool? and with every pool being unique, is the staker.sol contract essentially just rewarding one particular pool? to put it in context, say there are 3 pools (A,B,C) for wbtc-weth pairing. if i were to create an incentive, I would be creating an incentive for pool A, not (A,B,C) based on that one function call?

                    "content": "Hey @papiporn, off topic from this thread but to directly answer your question about UIs and contracts for liquidity mining Uniswap v3 LP NFTs, we have what I believe is the first full suite front end at Frax Finance. For example, you can check out our Uni V3 farming pair UI and contracts here: app .frax  .finance/staking#Uniswap_V3_FRAX_USDC We also allow locking the NFT LP for an additional boost to increase stickiness of the LP program. The farming contract also allows setting of range/ticks that are incentivized instead of generalized. The contract itself can be found here: etherscan .io/ address/0x3EF26504dbc8Dd7B7aa3E97Bc9f3813a9FC0B4B0 I think the other protocol that might have full Uni v3 farming infrastructure other than FRAX is Gelato\u2019s G UNI system. Maker is using them to manage their PSM module. I think they also are expanding it to generalized farming for end-users right now as well. Hope that helps  ",

From what I\u2019m seeing in this thread, it seems like there is a mountain of Uni tokens and then some stable coins. Besides protocol fees, how are contributors being rewarded? Does the treasury plan to diversify more? Sorry not active in the community and trying to learn more about the treasury. Forgive the noob question please. ",

For example, I\u2019m thinking the payroll component could be automated to reduce time/effort needed on operations and ensure all full-time contributors or contracted (like Llama) get paid on time. I believe Coinshift recently did an integration with Superfluid, so DAO payroll can run automatically via real-time streams and settle multiple \u201csalary streams\u201d in a single batch. ",
