Dashboard charts  image952\u00d7491 69.9 KB  Dashboard numbers now have accompanying background charts that shows their recent development. This\u2019ll hopefully help give a sense of each value\u2019s recent momentum better than just the 24h change.  Burn auctions Makerburn loves burns (obviously), so a bunch of features have been added to visualize the process now that the burner has been properly reignited.  image928\u00d7170 16.1 KB  Running surplus (flap) auctions now appears on top of the burn page with an instruction on how to participate.  image930\u00d7285 21.3 KB  A settlement price chart shows historic settlement prices for auctions. Prices below whatever current market price is at the time of viewing have a teal colour (appologies to all my colour blind friends).  image938\u00d7278 21 KB  The slippage chart shows how much above or below market we are paying when burning MKR. Auctions that went below market are coloured purple (once again appologies to all my colour blind friends).  Liquidations  image938\u00d7252 8.9 KB  A new chart visualizes recent liquidations. That one 8.4M ETH A liquidation really stands out!  Treasury page  image1320\u00d7665 62.9 KB  A new treasury page shows assets currently controlled by the DAO.  image1338\u00d7663 76.3 KB  Each asset may be clicked or tapped to show that specific asset\u2019s history.  Dashboard alerts  image916\u00d7132 16.3 KB  A new card displays a countdown for when the latest executive spell may be triggered.  image914\u00d794 10.4 KB  Another card informs whenever there are active surplus auctions to look at.  Makerburnbot upgrades  Upgrades are being made continuously to Makerburnbot as well. For instance, the bot will now post burn auction offers as they are made and make a note when executive spells are triggered. Check it out in the #bot-feed discord channel.  Other stuff Various minor changes and visual improvements are always being made, so remember to check back from time to time. As always, if there is something you\u2019d like to see changed or added, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. Thank you for using the site and I hope you all enjoy the upcoming holidays  ",

Debt ceilings I\u2019ve spent a lot of time lately trying to put more focus on debt ceilings and our tendency to hit them, stopping growth - not only through updates to makerburn, but also here on the forum (1, 2). To that end, I\u2019ve also created a warning on the makerburn dashboard.  2021-11-08_14-47904\u00d7139 14.9 KB  A click or tap on this warning will take you to the collateral list where a \u201ccapped\u201d filter is pre-applied to single out the relevant collateral(s).  2021-11-08_14-47_1971\u00d7201 24.9 KB  This filter may also be applied manually, and there is an option for \u201cmaxed\u201d collaterals as well.  2021-11-08_14-48965\u00d7377 39.8 KB  There is also a warning on collateral detail pages.  And a new link to @lollike\u2019s web app in case you want to help out and trigger a DC increase yourself. Colouration shows when this is possible or critical.  2021-11-08_14-53_1934\u00d7149 12.1 KB  New collateralization doughnut A new doughnut chart on the bottom of the collateral list page show how much DAI is generated from each type of collateral. ETH, for example, in this case counts the generated DAI total from ETH-A, ETH-B and ETH-C. Note that this chart has filters from the above list applied, so it won\u2019t necessarily show data for the entire system.  2021-11-08_14-53885\u00d7346 36.1 KB  Chart option for P/E estimate Default selection also changed to profit estimate, P/E estimate (price over earnings) and fee income.  2021-11-08_15-231321\u00d7804 45.8 KB  MakerDAO growth page In case you\u2019ve ever wondered how MakerDAO is growing but don\u2019t want to read a chart, Makerburn\u2019s got you covered. Only 9x growth in DAI supply this past year when the year prior it grew by 10x. Woe is us .  2021-11-08_14-59906\u00d7484 66 KB  D3M support Support for the cool new Aave Direct Depost Module (D3M) has been implemented. The \u201cunclaimed interest\u201d counter accrues live based on the current apy of DAI deposits on Aave.  2021-11-08_15-291190\u00d7652 63.4 KB  And finally\u2026 Introducing Makerburnbot  Makerburnbot does his best to provide Discord users with cool updates as they happen.  Right now, he will post when large mints happen, when MKR is burned or when new liquidations are triggered. A \u201clarge mint\u201d means that the amount of DAI generated exceeds 0.05% of the total system supply (4.33M DAI at this moment when total supply is at 8.67B) or 1% of that collateral\u2019s supply (for example 1.5M for ETH-B which is at 150M). Do you think the bot is too spammy? Maybe it should have a lower limit of 1M for new mints? Or maybe you\u2019d even like to see more updates? Let me know in the comments! Other stuff There has also been a lot of minor improvements, like a 2 year duration option for the chart, but I think this post is already long enough. As always, if there is something you\u2019d like to see changed or added, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. Thank you all for using the site  ",

One more plug for an \u201cAnnualized profit per coin\u201d chart \u2014 given Makerburn\u2019s emphasis on burning, I think it would be nice to see that number grow over time through burns as well as profit increases. I know that \u201cAnnualized profit per coin\u201d would be very similar to the current \u201cAnnual profit estimate\u201d, but the latter lacks a measure of how many coins are extant. \u201cAnnualized profit per coin\u201d would also be related/similar to the current \u201cP/E estimate\u201d, but the latter includes prices swings in MKR which muddies the EPS. Thanks again!! ",
