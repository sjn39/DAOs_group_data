                    "content": "I see it\u2019s discussed in multiple threads here, spend over hour reading them but didn\u2019t see getting to anything actionable? As a user that has both significant CDP, MKR and liquidity positions  in uniswap I would like to share the value I see in such decision for whatever it\u2019s worth. Right now I have to choose between collateralizing crypto to access liquid cash (since I\u2019m long term holder and won\u2019t sell at current prices) and putting my assets to work and generate me passive ROI. Well, I\u2019m currently doing both but the crypto that is currently collateral in makerdao is not productive for me. If I can collateralize LP uniswap tokens, I\u2019ll be able to have my assets work for me earning me passive income and at the same time use them to access fresh cash for other, more active investments or ongoing expenses. That for me will be like being able to eat my cake and have it at the same time. Heck, I\u2019ll even (probably) be able to cover the MKR interest from my uniswap income and have some left over. From my perspective having access to debt for free. Now from the makerdao and MKR holders perspective that is also VERY good because ton of people will be generating debt and won\u2019t mind paying the interest indefinitely if they are making more from those assets than the interest. For example right now only the ETH-WBTC  uniswap pool has almost half billion $. In 45 days the UNI rewards will stop and those people won\u2019t have to stake their LP tokens at uniswap but will be able to do whatever they want with them. The other slight positive is that by having LP token that represent 2 assets you average down the risk a little. TL;DR If you have uniswap LP tokens as collateral, it\u2019s great for both the users of MakerDAO, and the DAO and it\u2019s MKR holders as well. Win-win. ",

Honestly I look at this 10B locked in DeFI number and think to myself - how much of this is the same DAI being counted over and over and over again because of the cycling or one asset class into another deposit account to borrow another\u2026 I completely agree that interest bearing assets make it easier to digest a borrowing fee on Maker.
