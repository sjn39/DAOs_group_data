                    "content": "I\u2019m aware of some companies in Europe which had or continue having issues to access to credit lines from banks. I\u2019m talking about entities which have assets (ie. Real Estate), very low or even null debt (due to the issues to access to credit), and even though have this denial from banks. The issues with the banks is as follow, these companies have their work force all over the world, some of them in countries like Belarus, Cuba, Venezuela. Banks deny credit because they should keep their business with USA, and they are afraid of having issues due to it. The risk then is not in the company itself, it is in the sole fact that this company has part of its work force in a country which have sanction from the USA government (and banks need to continue leading with USD of course and be subject to USA-rules); and the \u201cbest\u201d explanation I\u2019ve listened so far is that the bank cannot guarantee that the money lent will not be used to pay in USD to those employees and therefore, they prefer to deny the credit / loan. Once again, nothing wrong with these companies,all the business they do is completely within the legal framework, there is nothing wrong (in most of European countries, or all of them) to make business with naturals or the private sector in the aforementioned countries. I see an important potential in RWA loans to get rid of this annoying situation for these companies, but there are too many unknowns (for me) in this regard.   Have we thought in how to increase the \u201cLenderCo\u201d and \u201cTrusts\u201d  around the world? ie. any projection or interest from somebody in Europe?   Let\u2019s say that a company in Poland (closer known case) is willing to get such a loan, the more reasonable will be to contact a Polish entity which will be the lender. Should this entity respond as well to a \u201cPolish MakerDAO Trust\u201d? or could a LenderCo in Poland have an agreement with any \u201cEuropean MakerDAO Trust\u201d  or even American? Any research done in this regard?   Let\u2019s say that no LenderCo exists in that moment in Poland, and a given entity is really desiring / needing to get that loan. Maybe it can receive support from the community to reach several Lenders in Poland and propose them to make an agreement with a given Trust?   I\u2019m assuming that the community will not want right now that the company willing to get the loan contact or get into agreement directly with the Trust. Is this correct? Is there some work-around to this?   Maybe too early questions for the RWA things, but I guess that somebody out there could have similar questions. Would be great to open this discussion or have links to similar discussions if they exists. Thanks! ",

I think the best issue is to have a Maker entity (or most likely entities) at some point. Let\u2019s call that the Lender Entity. The Lender Entity can be anywhere in the world but most likely in countries with a good legal framework (including tax efficiencies). The real issue with your proposal is that lending DAI to Poland (that might go to Venezuela) is that we take a risk. Is DAI dollars? No one knows but I\u2019m quite sure a court/legislation can decide that yes. Quite sure no one will be willing to pay a fine. So the next step might be to be banned from the US and all our assets in the US seized.  You can say goodbye to the 6S loan. Centrifuge assets are a bit tricker. Technically, any borrower can reuse the 6S template and come to us. It\u2019s up to Maker Gov to decide how much regulatory risk they want to take. ",

I don\u2019t exclude that possibility, but as a user of DAI myself, when I want to \u201cwithdraw DAI\u201d to my local bank, typically I have to use EUR (not USD), ie. Coinbase permits to withdraw only in EUR (not Dollars), or at least it is like that for Polish users. If a company by itself converts those EUR to USD and pays to Venezuelans with it, that\u2019s completely legal (within most of the European legislations), but yes, I don\u2019t discard that US government wants to sanction that company (most that it could make is to forbid it to interact with other American companies, since there is nothing wrong being done here, and that company doesn\u2019t operate in US jurisdiction).     SebVentures:  So the next step might be to be banned from the US and all our assets in the US seized.   Very good point @SebVentures, this means that our risk using RWA in US includes those of centralization of USDC with USDC Vaults right? I need to go in more details through the Risk assessment done for RWA-001, probably this is one of the risks mentioned there. Some time ago a brought to discussion the issue with US government and loans which could end in their black-listed countries. I would like to think that our DAO could have very strong pillars for being able to bypass those issues. In fact, if you ask me about a solution, I would say that ensuring that RWA extends to other countries and keep loans in US under some line or % of total of RWA loans is a very important goal, others countries in the world are not placing sanctions off their jurisdiction as US does, those are much more trustable in my case. Note that I definitely support 100% having 6S and others lenders from USA, that\u2019s a must definitely! specially in the current economical world arrangement. But I will put priority to reducing risks having lenders in many other countries around the world. Not saying it\u2019ll be an easy task definitely, as you say, we need efficient tax structures in the legal framework of those countries. ",
