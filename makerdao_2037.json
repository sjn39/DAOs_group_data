The precedent we would set is that any time there is user error in connection with Maker in some shape or form, Maker is on the hook to pay for their loss out of pocket. This could end up resulting in things such as dai insolvency and people who did nothing wrong losing their savings in an emergency shutdown. That\u2019s not possible to commit to. However I have thought about a long term solution  for cases like this that helps alleviate the loss without forcing others to pay for the user error. The solution is that Maker could create a special \u201clost dai token\u201d (lets call it LDAI) that can be sent to those who have provably made their dai unrecoverable in the dai smart contract and maybe other 100% provably unrecoverable destinations. The lost Dai token would have no rights if an emergency shutdown happens, and wouldn\u2019t be usable to pay down vault debt, but it could safely be made to earn the DSR, as long as its provable that all of the lost dai that the LDAI tokens replace are permanently unable to earn the DSR themselves. This way, users who have lost their dai can still earn yield on the lost dai, and they may also be able to recover some of their funds by selling their LDAI tokens to others who are looking to lock their money into the DSR on a very long term basis and don\u2019t think an emergency shutdown is likely. In the end this feature would still be pretty complex so i dont see it being built anytime soon but it does seem like a solution that would actually provide some kind of compensation for those are unfortunate enough to have lost their dai, but without imposing a cost or unfair punishment on any other users. Maybe there are better iterations of this type of approach, but in all cases it would be good to have a commitment and discussion to figure out what steps maker can take that, without breaking the system, can support users that have lost funds due to user error.

Theoretically I agree although, as it is, the way the Vat would count them is as if they are still circulating. Without a way to rebase the surplus buffer to take into account this $600k Dai that\u2019s stuck means issuing any new Dai would in practice reduce the surplus buffer\u2013to Rune\u2019s point. I agree that they are for all intents and purposes \u2018part\u2019 of the surplus buffer in the sense that they will never be redeemed and are fully backed, but are not \u2018part\u2019 of the surplus buffer in the sense that they will never absorb any losses either. It would then cost ~$70m + penalty to push Maker into insolvency according to its own accounting. Perhaps I am missing a key technical feature? ",

The LDAI approach let\u2019s the market figure out the risk of an ES and would provide a solution that can used by default in every provably irrecoverable dai scenario without having to consider risk management and think more about the problem, even in cases where massive amounts are lost.

                    "content": "Even though it\u2019s very unfortunate for the people who made this mistake, funds locked into the Dai contract represent a very small fraction of the total Dai supply. It\u2019s not fair to the general Dai holder to bear additional risk to help a hanful of people to get their money back. Regarding the LDAI approach, it is something that is technically difficult to achieve. There\u2019s no way to have the recovery to happen entirely on-chain, since we depend on events emitted by the Dai contract to actually track the amounts and the original owners. Someone would have to build a script that would reconstruct the original balances for the different accounts. For gas efficiency, the account => LDAI balance mapping can be compressed into a Merkle Tree whose root would be committed to a smart contract that would control the supply of LDAI token. LDAI would be issued only by users who are able to provide the full Merkle Proof for their account. To make that possible, the entire Merkle Tree would have to be uploaded to IPFS or something similar. The LDAI redemption process would be:  Find the Merkle Tree Look for your account and the appropriate balance Build the Merkle Proof for the node your account belongs to Find the LDAI Issuer contract Submit a transaction from the account you wish to recover funds for with the Merkle Proof.  This is a mouthful, even for savvy users. Most likely there would need to be a nice UI that helps users to go through that process. Notice that anyone could build all that today without even asking Maker Governance about it. However if that were to become an official recovery path, everything described here would have to be validated/audited, either using the existing governance tools, or leveraging some crowdsourcing platform. When it comes to the price of LDAI, It will most likely never be 1:1 for some reasons:  The perceived risk will never be zero, because ES will most likely be possible throughout the entire existence of the Maker Protocol. Why would someone buy 1 \u201calmost Dai\u201d for 1 Dai? LDAI supply will be rather small (last time I checked there was less than 1 MM Dai locked in the Dai contract), so it will be hard to build an efficient and low-slippage pool.  ",

I downloaded the data from Etherscan, however it did require some manual cleanup (Etherscan messes up with decimals when exporting the data). I focused on getting the highest values correct, there may be some incorrect data in the last quartile. Here is the data: https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUzvXPcXK2RpagaGzETUgfqX2X1oUh9kv2ys7feJbZobF.

As unfortunate as it is, the cost of developing/maintaining a recovery mechanism seems way higher than what could be gained as a cut (be it 10% or whatever) of the recovery, even if we take the simplest approach as suggested by @rune.

The Dai contract has the function of additional issuance. The customer\u2019s Dai is transferred to the contract itself and it is destroyed, so the recovery itself is a kind of balance of funds, and the funds will neither be less nor more  Specification / Proposal Details  If people transfer their Dai to the contract address, and the contract address has the characteristic of being permanently non-transferable, then we regard it as permanently destroyed When the Dai is regarded as permanently destroyed, it will be issued to the transferor through the mint function on the smart contract Maker should offer some kind of support for Dai sent to the contract.

The Dai contract has the function of additional minting. The customer\u2019s Dai is transferred to the contract itself and it is destroyed, so the recovery itself is a kind of balance of funds, and the funds will neither be less nor more  Declaration Detail This MIP proposes that people who passively and permanently lock Dai in the Dai contract have the ability to get their funds back. If people transfer their Dai to the contract address, and the contract address has the characteristic of being permanently non-transferable, then we regard it as permanently destroyed. When the Dai is regarded as permanently destroyed, it will be issued to the transferrer through the mint function in the smart contract. Maker should offer some kind of support for Dai sent to the contract \u2014 maybe with a 10% penalty to discourage abuse.

As described in this forum post, DssCure has been built and supports the calculation of debt for governance identified addresses. This means it is possible to calculate the amount of DAI out of circulation (i.e. locked in a particular address). In the interest of transparency, there is outstanding work to make this fully operational for DAI redemption, including:  Write a merkle tree distribution contract (approx 2 weeks of work) that will return DAI to the accounts that incorrectly made transfers to the DAI contract. Have this contract audited by an external auditor Have Governance agree to an ongoing social contract* Governance proposes and votes on an executive  *The bulk of the work will be in the social contract that Governance is signing itself up to, including:  What will be the cadence of this merkle tree creation - yearly, half yearly, quarterly? Who will be responsible for the management of this merkle tree list, and what constraints will be included - e.g. only the DAI contract, programmatic redemptions only to addresses that sent DAI etc), What fee should be levied upon these transfers? Will the protocol cover any gas costs in addition to the fees? Are there any minimum redemption levels etc - I\u2019m sure Governance can think of a good set of clarifying constraints/rules here. Will this fee be sent to the pause proxy or to the team carrying out the work? etc\u2026  Note that there will be a not insignificant amount of work in the above step (2) for the rules to be explicitly stated so there is no confusion as to the extent of MakerDAO\u2019s responsibility - many people have sent DAI to other contract addresses, many people have sent DAI from CEX accounts that may redeem to CEX addresses etc - the use cases should be mapped out so there is no social level confusion as to future redemption expectations.

Another question we want to pose to the greater community is whether the strategic objectives of this DAO will be geared towards Retail in the near future? MakerDAO seems to be in a path of B2B and has forgotten its roots of producing/shipping/partnerships for Retail friendly DAI products. If the main focus will be mainly on institutional graded RWAs then what is the strategic focus on the end-user customer service experience? Is there a desire for such? We ask @Recognized-Delegates to take a close look at Derek\u2019s post above, and think thoroughly when it comes to the strategic end-user relationships this DAO wants to build, if any. ",

Who will be responsible for the management of this merkle tree list, and what constraints will be included - e.g. only the DAI contract, programmatic redemptions only to addresses that sent DAI etc), What fee should be levied upon these transfers? Will the protocol cover any gas costs in addition to the fees? Are there any minimum redemption levels etc - I\u2019m sure Governance can think of a good set of clarifying constraints/rules here. Will this fee be sent to the pause proxy or to the team carrying out the work? etc\u2026  Note that there will be a not insignificant amount of work in the above step (2) for the rules to be explicitly stated so there is no confusion as to the extent of MakerDAO\u2019s responsibility - many people have sent DAI to other contract addresses, many people have sent DAI from CEX accounts that may redeem to CEX addresses etc - the use cases should be mapped out so there is no social level confusion as to future redemption expectations.   If this does pass, I plan to contribute to this governance work. (Though to be explicit I hope to be able to avoid responsibility for on-going management.) ",
