Please familiarize yourself with the Nominations process for RetroPGF round 2.   Overview of Timelines  Project nominations: Jan 17 19:00 GMT - Jan 31 19:00 GMT Final project opt-in deadline: Feb 21 Voting: Mar 7 - Mar 21   image1920\u00d7960 32.1 KB    Scope of this round RetroPGF round 2 is dedicated to projects that support development and usage of the OP Stack. For the category of Tooling + Utilities you may nominate  Work that helps builders create applications on Optimism mainnet Work that helps builders build on the OP Stack Work that helps builders interact with governance of the Collective Work that helps builders use applications built on Optimism  Note: The OP Stack refers to the OSS code powering Optimism. Today, this means the Optimism monorepo and its dependencies. Eligible projects need not be exclusive to the Optimism ecosystem, but there should be a connection. For example,   go-ethereum is an important dependency of the OP Stack, but is not Optimism-specific.  Ethereum L2 explorer pages which give stats on various L2s provide educational impact for the OP Stack, but are not Optimism-specific    How to Nominate a Project Things to consider when nominating a project:  Try to describe as best as you can how this project has delivered impact relating to the scope of this round. Make sure to nominate projects in the relevant category Before nominating a project please see if this project has been nominated already, so we can avoid duplication.  For Projects:  If you are a project looking to participate in this round please have a read of the Project Manual, it has an overview of the process and an FAQ section to answer questions that might come up. For your project to be eligible you will need to opt into the round and complete a project profile in the RetroPGF application manager by Feb 21 - 19:00 GMT. This will include providing more information about your project and verifying your Github or Twitter account. The application manager will be launched by end of Jan, more details to follow on this soon! Any project without a correctly verified GitHub or Twitter account, any project impersonating another team, any project not relating to the scope of the round, or any project without a complete profile may be hidden from the voting round at the Foundation\u2019s discretion. Projects are allowed to nominate themselves. Here the term \u201cproject\u201d can describe work that has been done by both an individual or a group. Collections, a term used to describe projects without a single person or entity that can be verified via GitHub or Twitter, may only be nominated by the Optimism Foundation.   Please use this template to Nominate a project:   The projects name:  A description of how the project has supported development and usage of the OP Stack:  A link to the project\u2019s GitHub or Twitter:  (optional) contact info for the project or project lead:  Project Nominations will close by Jan 31 at 19:00 GMT ",

The projects name: delegation.tools   A description of how the project has supported development and usage of the OP Stack: When the OP token was launched there was some confusion on how users could change delegate after completing all the steps in the airdrop process. I created delegation.tools as a tool to let people see who they are delegating to and change delegate in a couple of clicks. Today it is still used. I started collecting anonymous statistics in October, they are public and you can see them here. Recently I started tracking how many times it was used to actually change delegate. In the last 30 days it has received ~4500 visitors which resulted in ~2000 changes of delegate.

Rigoblock liquidity has generated more than 50MM USD token swap volume on Ethereum mainnet. Our pools have been providing liquidity on Uniswap v3 on Optimism, including OP token pairs. Rigoblock\u2019s GRG token has been airdropped to 9k wallets on Optimism. Work that helps builders create applications on Optimism mainnet:  enabling any holder to use a cold key for moving tokens from/to a Rigoblock smart wallet and a \u201chot\u201d key (that can be stored on i.e. a mobile wallet) for moving the tokens within said smart wallet, i.e. swaps, providing liquidity; enabling the organisation of groups of token holders under \u201cumbrella\u201d smart pools operated by a pool operator. deterministic proxy factory which seamlessly generates lightweight proxies with same-address on each chain (where it gets deployed). original approach to smart contract storage which prevents accidental storage collision between proxy and implementation, improving smart contract security, usable by any developer in their own protocol/application under the Apache2.0 License.  Work that helps builders use applications built on Optimism:  minimizing the DeFi smart contract risk. Each time a wallet is required to set an allowance to an external application, the protocol approves the amount, executes the transaction and removes the allowance without clearing storage, avoiding unnecessary gas costs (i.e. approval abstraction); precompiling and batching multiple transactions. An Optimism user can send one transaction to its Rigoblock pool and execute multiple transactions on one (or many) external application simultaneously. This is also relevant for governance operations that require multiple transactions by a user, improving UX, which is particularly important for governance participation; a simple interface to interact with DeFi applications through Rigoblock.

Project name: rotki - open source portfolio tracker, accounting and analytics tool A description of how the project has supported development and usage of the OP Stack: rotki used a Phase 1 grant to integrate Optimism into the app. The development has been completed and is ready for use on the develop branch, which will be released soon. As rotki is free and open source, anyone is free to build on top of it, or to re-use the code in their own software. This makes it an obvious fit for the first two areas of the scope of this category. On top of that, the founder and CEO of rotki, @lefterisjp is a well-known and active member and contributor to the Optimism Community, one of the top 10 delegates of the Token House. His views and actions are well aligned with the Optimism Collective\u2019s mission, and he puts them into practice in rotki\u2019s architecture and development. It\u2019s important to note that even if someone is not an active Rotki user, it\u2019s in their best interest to see Rotki used and developed, as it\u2019s probably the only local portfolio tracker that puts user privacy and security ahead of fancy UX and catchy features. The fact that we have free, open source software integrated into our crypto infrastructure ensures that this infrastructure is still trustless and permissionless. Even if you don\u2019t use a local portfolio manager right now, it\u2019s important to be able to use it because it ensures that you can keep your data private and secure at all times, without relying on centralised services or intermediaries.

It makes it simple to compile Rust code to MIPs with helpers to read inputs, write outputs and access the pre-image oracle. The results of the execution of this code can be fraud-proven on-chain using the OP stack Solidity contracts. Currently Optimism only maintains a Golang stack part of the official Cannon repo. This template came about as a side project from the 2022 EthBerlin hackathon. It has already been used in the DevCon hackathon (by a team I was part of) to build Zipline a Ethereum light-client bridge based on the OP stack which is seeing continued development. It is difficult to estimate how many developers have used the template so far but as of writing it has around 20 stars on Github. Lowering the barrier to entry for developers to experiment with this part of the stack is important to encourage hacking and innovation going forward.

I was previously using MetaMask until I was recommended Infinity Wallet by a friend. On changing I had a completely new experience that has changed my entire perspective of crypto and blockchain. Its the only wallet I know of that delivers such quality and has unique features. Before I found out about Infinity Wallet using OP was extremely difficult to find out what to do to get started and use web3, or even transact. I have tried more than 20 wallets since 2016 and none of them are a touch on what the Infinity Wallet team have delivered. Since moving to Infinity Wallet my experience on OP has completely evolved from web3 access and discovering the OP ecosystem, to being able to instantly onboard in a single click from any chain, to even making transactions is all seamless. Its like they have jumped forward 5 years into the future compared to everyone else! Infinity Wallet for me is one of the only reasons I am active in OP as it changed my entire experience and that of many other people that I recommended it to now. For me without Infinity Wallet the OP ecosystem would not be the same and I would never have been able to fully take advantage and use apps built on OP without it.

Developers can implement conditions to loan NFTs as collateral, build social recovery mechanisms (Soulbound tokens / non-transferable Tokens / NTTs) or use them as role markers (what we do at Otterspace). Tim Daubensch\u00fctz pioneered the work on non-transferable tokens (with EIP-4973). Upon release of the DeSoc paper, Tim worked with the community to address their concerns around privacy and consent. He organized workshops, gave talks, and interviewed users at multiple conferences in 2022. He expanded the non-transferable tokens narrative with various articles (links below) outlining his vision. At Otterspace we have built atop of Tim\u2019s work and today, over 950 Otterspace Badges have been minted on Optimism using Tim\u2019s standards. Additionally, various other projects (> 200 developer references in GitHub) are building non-financial use cases based on his work. While we at Otterspace funded Tim\u2019s work (2 months) to implement EIP-4973, the majority of his work (> 1 year) remains unpaid. Tim is a big fan of Optimism\u2019s RetroPGF. He successfully nominated the LeapDAO in R1 ( 1.6 ETH). Having faced the community\u2019s critique on Soulbound tokens, developed a solution, and implemented a standard that stands to become the go-to-standard for non-transferable tokens, I believe, Tim would be stoked to receive funding for his work as it confirms its merit, improves his financial stability, and will allow him to double down on more standard development. In my opinion, an Ethereum Magician like Tim is the perfect candidate for RetroPGF!

These tokens can be used to signal community membership and status, in governance, as rewards, education credentials, and more. Otterspace is an Optimism-first project and has brought dozens of communities (incl. Bankless DAO, Radicle DAO, and Cabin DAO) onto the chain. It has helped hundreds of users to get their first experience with the Optimism ecosystem (over 900 Badges have been minted so far). The Otterspace protocol allows other projects to build their Soulbound token protocols on top of Otterspace & Optimism, which projects like the Token Engineering Academy or SafeSend have done. Otterspace is contributing to the tooling & utilities of DAOs and Web3 communities and contributes to making Optimism an attractive option for new communities to start. As a launch partner of the Attestation Station, Otterspace will upload attestations, contributing to the Optimism NFT project. I believe that Otterspace\u2019s work, building and launching tools for DAOs, and the positive impact it is having on the ecosystem, make them a great candidate for the RPGF. Links  Otterspace Website Otterspace Twitter Otterspace GitHub Otterspace Mirror  Disclaimer Otterspace is using the EIP-4973 and EIP-5912 standards for Soulbound tokens (account-bound tokens) that I developed (and am also nominated for) and has funded my work between May 2022 and July 2022. We have been working closely on progressing the state of Soulbound tokens and are proud contributors to the optimistic vision. ",

Our first collection was Oliens which was launched as a free mint on Quix launched on 9th of july 2022 & it quickly got sold out. Oliens has added new unique users to Optimism chain because of its Art and free mint launch and it continued to reach +3.2K trades & more than 47 ETH volume & it is known as a popular collection on Optimism chain. After this collection we continued our journey & created a DAO, based on Oliens holders to engage more with our community to use their feedback for the remainder of the project. Our team in Ospace project carries a lot of ideas & enthusiasm towards NFT & gaming fields & we also believe in optimism\u2019s future which makes us even more interested. We have a community which appreciates new ideas & this OP drop will help us to advance the project towards this direction. Grant Category: NFTs & Gaming Total VOL: 47 ETH Total Sales: 3219 Unique Holders: 1474 Twitter Followers: 10.3K Discord Members: +9K Number of OP Tokens requested: 30,000 Our idea for possible OP tokens usage: We currently feel the need for the op tokens in three areas. If Optimism foundation agrees with our proposal, we will put these 3 options up for voting in our dao & will allocate op tokens to each option according to the percentage of their votes. The three options are listed below: 1: We will be using Createra to get one step closer to our goal of entering the Metaverse & gaming field. Createra gives the opportunity to their Land holders to Build & Grow their creativity of building a world of their own. In this section we\u2019ll use the Op tokens to purchase createra land to design and develop games for Oliens Holders. 2: We will develop a platform where artists can submit their NFT collections & we will select a collection every month depending on its art or its use case & will drop the collection to active optimism NFT users for free ( free mint ). The selected artists will receive a grant from the op stack of this section & these free mint drops will continue until the stack runs out. All the royalties of these collections will be allocated to the optimism public goods. 3: At this stage, we will start creating weekly Quests and Tasks via crew3/twitter/discord & reward users with OP Tokens. The purpose of these tasks is to keep more users active in the NFT field on optimism blockchain. Links: ospaceproject | Twitter | Linktree https://twitter.com/Ospaceproject ",

It is installed as a Hardhat plugin which can be used to create mock Solidity contracts entirely in JavaScript (or TypeScript!). With Smock, writting tests for smarts contracts becomes incredibly easy, improving the security of the ecosystem a whole. Smock was first built out of necessity by Optimism in March 2021. The testing library saw use by the Optimism team, and a few others, reaching a total of 69 stars in Github. Later, in July 2021, Wonderland took the mission to rewrite Smock in a more scalable way, also adding many requested features, and improving the overall developer experience. All of these changes helped Smock become the de facto Solidity mocking library, increasing it\u2019s usage by ~40 times. Added to the development time that Wonderland invested in the library, Wonderland as well funded issue bounties via Dework, in order to incentivise the community continous development and improvement of Smock. How much has been its impact? From inception, its use has been extended among Optimism and solidity developers in all EVM chains, and we\u2019re proud of reaching:  17 releases Depedency in 795 repositories 279 stars in Github  Smock usage can be found all over the main Optimism Repository, and in many other protocols currently deployed in Optimism. Who are we? DeFi Wonderland is a team of top Web3 researchers, developers, and operators who believe that the future needs to be open-source, permissionless, and decentralized. Our partnerships with some of the most successful and promising projects in Web3, including Yearn, Sudoswap, Connext, and Keep3r, have allowed us to tackle complex engineering challenges and help these protocols reach their full potential. We\u2019re excited to continue working with the best in the industry to drive innovation and growth in the Web3 ecosystem.

Remix IDE is a powerful and versatile integrated development environment (IDE) that is specifically designed to support the development and deployment of smart contracts on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain networks. It provides developers with a wide range of tools and features that make it easy to write, test, and deploy smart contracts, as well as interact with them once they are deployed. One of the key advantages of Remix IDE is its support for the OP Stack. The OP Stack is a set of open-source tools and protocols that enable developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain. Without Remix IDE, developers would have to rely on a combination of command-line tools and text editors, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. With Remix IDE, developers can use a single, unified interface to write and test smart contracts, deploy them to the blockchain, and interact with them in real-time. This makes it much easier to build and maintain dapps on the OP Stack, and allows developers to focus on the logic of their contracts rather than the technical details of deployment. In conclusion, Remix IDE is an essential tool for any developer looking to build and deploy dapps on the OP Stack. It simplifies the development process and provides a range of powerful features that make it easy to write, test, and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

While the Foundation releases a fantastic general weekly recap, we feel a governance-focused summary will be useful for delegates and voters due to the rapid pace of governance news and updates. When appropriate we\u2019ll \u2026     Personal note on Boardroom\u2019s nomination: Boardroom received a grant in phase 1, using 80% in incentives for delegations and 20% to maintain and update the site.

The infrastructure allows devs to deploy high scale oracles for any API with the contracts, nodes and front end all ready to use in <15m. This allows devs to create oracles using their own reputable signers in their communities or use a reference oracle by the Scry team to request data to be brought onchain. Optimism is severly underserved by other oracle networks with not even 50 feeds by the largest oracle providers, while Scry enables >200 feed updates with just 1 tx. These feeds also allow new capibilities such as onchain historical lookup for feed values at any timestamp, no code deployment and feed management and custom signer sets that can be updated. New feeds can be deployed in <60s to deployed oracles allowing high-scale data in realtime. Scry allows new use cases such as insurance, financial tools and non financial tools which need external data to be able to deploy to the Optimism network with very little resource requirements and time getting the data there. The factory allows easy oracle deployment by devs without even needing to deploy a contract using hardhat themselves, just a simple etherscan tx, a script and they\u2019re operational. The documenation can be found at Introduction - Scry Protocol Custom Optimism Front End for all oracles to have a front end for data exploration https://optimism.dapp.scry.finance/ The infrastructure is fully decentralized and the ONLY protocol in the space that allows devs to deploy their own oracles and control the oracle and feeds fully using their own security/signers/feed sources, as well as wrapping this into a very simple process to allow for rapid deployment and usability. The deployments have no cost, the node/front end and contracts are all open source. The oracles simply take n signers with t threshold and the oracle returns the med val from n signers that submitted the feed, as long as t signers have submitted for a given slot, the slot being how often the oracle should update. Further grants funds will go towards a reference oracle to allow devs to just request feeds if they do not wish to deploy their own oracle and help serve devs on the fly for data they need, being used for gas to maintain the oracle updates.

The main features of the dm3 protocol are:  to initiate a \u2018central\u2019 registry (utilising ENS) for the information necessary for secure communication, such as public keys for encryption and signatures, and delivery information, and to enable a decentralised and scalable network of independent self-sovereign delivery service nodes.  Currently, Optimism has counted several projects focused on social or messaging interactions: Alchemy, Atlantis World, Etherscan, Gnosis Safe, Nansen, Zerion and counting. With the Interoperability Initiative we are committed to enabling the secure exchange of messages between different protocols, services, and applications using the dm3 protocol to enable an interoperable web3 messaging ecosystem, but also to integrate communication registry information sources like other chains and services, and especially in the Optimism ecosystem. With freely usable components (dm3 embedded widgets, open-sourced under BSD license), dApps can easily integrate messaging functionality with minimal effort (e.g. in-dApp communication, support channels, etc). Optimism can now be ideally used to publish dm3 communication profiles so that users of dApps can communicate with users of any dm3-compatible application or service. The dm3 protocol as a Public Good welcomes any participant of the messaging and social ecosystem to integrate with the dm3 interoperability initiative, and by doing so, also integrates with the Optimism Ecosystem. In conclusion, we built an open standard for messaging and we are bringing it to Optimism. A link to the project\u2019s GitHub, Twitter, and website: You can find our open source project at github (specification and reference implementation) and on twitter at @dm3protocol. The website with more information on the dm3 interoperability initiative and dm3 embedded components, incl. the working reference implementation can be accessed at www.dm3.network.

Optimism has directly benefited in at least three different ways: 1. Direct use by the Optimism team to build Optimism itself, including contracts and testing infrastructure This is visible on Github. The Optimism team also built internal Hardhat utilities to interact with the protocol. 2. Hardhat plugins by the Optimism team for the community to be able to build and test early on Hardhat is designed as a platform for developer tooling to be built on top, which allowed the Optimism team to build different utilities and plugins that made it compatible with Optimism early on when the tech had more discrepancies with Ethereum than today. Hardhat was leveraged to bootstrap Optimism as it was initially the only dev tool available to build on Optimism. The team directly built two plugins for this purpose:   @eth-optimism/plugins/hardhat/compiler. Integrated Optimism\u2019s custom compiler at the time. Now a legacy component.  @eth-optimism/plugins/hardhat/ethers. Integrated Optimism\u2019s ethers.js fork. Now a legacy component.  In addition, they also built Smock on top of Hardhat for internal use, which is now community-driven and heavily used for mocking across the wider ecosystem. 3. Usage by the Optimism community to build smart contracts that run on Optimism Many developers use Hardhat to build the apps and contracts that they run on Optimism. The widely-used and officially maintained hardhat-etherscan plugin also supports Optimism directly.

Sugar: makes Velodrome devs life sweeter Sugar was born as the need to unify the 10+ contracts handling Velodrome into an easy to use interface with full access to the normalized dataset representing the real-time state of our protocol. This massively reduced our RPC costs and improved our V2 UI/UX. It reduced the development time and maintenance, and allowed to onboard partners into protocol mechanics with minimal effort. On the smart-contract development side, it exposed ABI design issues and performance optimizations opportunities. On the infrastructure side, it exposed issues where Vyper support on optimism can be improved and issues with it on optimistic.etherscan.io which we reported back to the OP team. Sugar is also new, I haven\u2019t seen anything like it done before and the reason I\u2019d like to highlight it is mainly for educational purposes. Developers are free to use it to integrate Velodrome liquidity pool data and even historical emissions, veNFT status and available rewards or just display the voting distribution. I believe OP Stack could benefit a lot from good UI/UX and we should strive to achieve that without Web2 solutions  Github: GitHub - velodrome-finance/sugar: Sugar makes Velodrome devs life sweeter \ud83c\udf6d ",

They\u2019ve also been the industry leader in NFT Wash Trading research, after incentive programs from upstart marketplaces led to inorganic volumes. This work was eventually documented, made easily accessible via a Dune abstraction, and trackable on a dashboard.

At OP Labs we maintain and operate our own public RPC endpoints (https://mainnet.optimism.io and https://goerli.optimism.io) as a public good. Our team knows first-hand the cost, time, and effort required to keep nodes up and stable to scalably serve RPC requests. Even with the effort and capital we\u2019ve put towards hosting our own public endpoints as a public good, I\u2019ve heard from multiple builders that the free, publicly accessible Ankr endpoint enables more requests before rate limiting while remaining fast and stable. Unlike other RPC providers, Ankr doesn\u2019t require an email signup or API key to start using its services, resulting in a seamless experience for developers to start developing on Optimism Goerli and Optimism Mainnet.

The project: NFTEarth A description of how the project has supported development and usage of the OP Stack: In just a couple short weeks, NFTEarth has created the foundations for bringing NFT momentum back to Optimism and in a sustainable manner. The team is scaling globally and building a large community of already over 7,000 members in Discord. The new project has already launched an NFT collection that has been traded in relatively high volume, and also led to the minting of thousands of new NFTs on Optimism, helping to kick-start NFT traction again! The goal of NFTEarth is to create a globally  accessible NFT hub for NFT creators, collectors, and DAOs to build NFTs, have educational resources for them, and a community to be a part of - that brings all the fragmented NFT tooling and services under one roof. The first network for NFTEarth is on Optimism with trades already having been completed, process of indexing all historical on-chain NFT data is nearly complete. The team is in talks with multiple infrastructure providers and L1 NFT collections working to bring their support to Optimism, and has tentatively agreed on moving forward with one infrastructure provider, with estimated compute units at over 1.5B/month as of current data usage. Links: Twitter GitHub Discord The individuals: Karthik Gupta and Ihsan Fauzi Rahman - please see their respective LinkedIn profiles here. https://www.linkedin.com/in/karthik-gupta-19030b68/ https://www.linkedin.com/in/ihsan-fauzi-rahman/ I have been working with several dozen people over the last few weeks trying to orchestrate the launch of the new NFT Exchange, many who have made significant contributions - the NFTEarth DAO currently has 39 Contributors on Optimism in the Wonderverse DAO management tool for example, but these two individuals have gone above and beyond to contribute in such an impactful way that I feel nominating them to be rewarded via RPGF is with merit. Karthik is a developer based out of Bangalore, India and has been instrumental in solving API challenges that the team has faced since the beginning of the endeavor. He has worked tirelessly, and together we worked to deploy contracts to be used for the new exchange. Ihsan is a developer based out of Jakarta, Indonesia and also has been incredibly creative and solution-oriented to getting the exchange to a fully globally scalable level. He has nearly single-handedly been able to create the Indexer that NFTEarth is using to create an Orderbook for the NFT exchange, and has delivered on building a fully-live and functional UI and backend infrastructure for NFTEarth to have a long and successful period of growth on Optimism! I\u2019ve attached some screenshots for review of the strong growth of the community and protocol progress here as well that directly show the progress on the utility and tooling efforts in NFTEarth itself.   Building a fully performant and scalable NFT marketplace will require a significant amount of resources, and I think NFTEarth has shown it is up for the challenge. Thanks all!

Its utility can vary from being proof of ownership, being used as a membership card, or being a security asset. In most cases, the actual value of NFT is firmly bonded to its utility. Hence \u201cthe core business\u201d of an NFT project is what matters. With more business-driven NFT projects, more sustainable growth could be expected in the space, which would benefit everyone in the ecosystem in both the short term and in the long run.  Speak of which, we need to reduce the barrier of those project founders who do real business to start an NFT project.  Anyway, it is worth noting that even if it looks easy to launch an NFT project, in reality, it is quite geeky and requires strong technical knowledge to start a quality one. A secured smart contract is required to ensure the smart contract has no security flaws. At the same time, a quality minting system is also necessary to give the user a flawless minting experience. Apetimism Launchpad is created to fulfill this gap and comes with the following features:   A secured and full-featured smart contract that can be deployed directly from the project founder\u2019s wallet. The project founder would own and get full control of the smart contract deployed.  Highly dynamic minting system where the project founder can control in many degrees, for example, mint round, mint limit, ming role, mint price, etc.  Bot prevention minting system to prevent the bot from sweeping the NFT.  Highly-scalable minting system that can handle any amount of traffic to ensure the mint site would not go down under any stress.  With Apetimism Launchpad, a project founder would save weeks or months of work and reduce it to a matter of minutes, which would not only give a massive benefit to the project founder but also to the whole ecosystem since the friction to launch a quality NFT project has never been lower. Apetimism Launchpad will be integrated as a launchpad for Zonic, the upcoming NFT marketplace for L2, which will deliver close-loop experiences for creators to deliver both 1st sale and 2nd sale systems.

The contracts support pricing that requires complex routes with many hops, supports non-standard ERC20 implementations and non-standard AMM curves, and is even optimized to allow for large calls that can best take advantage of the public Optimism RPC without using unnecessary computation. Optimism Prices Contracts are used by Velodrome to accurately price 120+ ERC20 tokens with 100% coverage to display dollar-denominated values on the Velodrome UI and maintain accurate APR data. The Optimism Prices Contracts can entirely replace centralized pricing APIs for the majority of dapps on Optimism, and were designed with the goal of strengthening Optimism\u2019s developer community by building tools that are simultaneously more efficient, and more trustless/verifiable. Future plans for the project include getting the Optimism Prices contracts indexed by Dune, to definitively solve some of the asset-pricing issues the community has been facing lately with not having full coverage for token prices on their dashboards. Other plans include adding support for TWAP prices for any arbitrary ERC20 asset to make the Optimism Prices Contracts viable for use cases that are more sensitive to short term price manipulation.

                    "content": "The Project name: Quark ID Description: CONCEPTUAL APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM In the analog world we physically carry different credentials or attestations in a wallet or purse, to prove each of the aspects that are part of our identity (driver\u2019s license, our ID card, club card, etc.). In addition, in the physical world we rely on a public or private agency to issue these verifiable documents and credentials. Just as we have many physical credentials that prove aspects of our identity, in the digital world there are many applications where we also store IDs that prove aspects of our identity: we have an app for health services, another for paying for public transportation, another for identification documents, etc. The problem is that people (holders) do not have the possibility to select which data to share, to verify an aspect of their identity or their relationship with a good or service; instead, they must present the document with all the information it contains, thus providing more data than necessary when requested. WHAT DOES QUARK ID PROPOSE TO CHANGE? All the applications we use in the digital world have their databases centralized in their datacenters and they are the ones who monopolize their users\u2019 information. Every time we tell our browser to store our credentials for accessing any online service, we are entrusting our data to the manufacturer of that browser (Microsoft, Google, etc.). The goal of Quark ID is that everything related to our identity is under our absolute control. That is to say, that any attribute referring to our identity is defined and guarded by us and we have the power to decide with whom we share it, for what purpose and for how long. WHAT IS QUARK ID? It is a self-sovereign digital identity and security framework co-created with the community of entrepreneurs, developers and experts in Latin America, and promoted by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires, which aims to give people back control over their credentials, with a security anchor through blockchain. Quark ID enables new ways of using your personal information and redefines access to services provided by all types of institutions and organizations, whether public or private. The protocol is decentralized, public, non-permissioned, open and extensible. In addition, it is interoperable and multichain, so that each ecosystem that wants to use this technology can choose the one they prefer. This is where we frame Quark ID as a cross digital identity and security framework and that it can use any blockchain, from a Layer 1 to a Layer 2. We believe the important thing is that this works as a public infrastructure, so that anyone can build value, and to transform and simplify the way the state and society relate, while empowering people by giving them back control over their identity. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF QUARK ID? Quark ID seeks to put the person at the center, that is, that citizens regain control over their data and become owners of their identity. People will have their credentials (which are issued by public and private organizations) on a single off-chain platform. All this information flow is protected by a peer-to-peer interaction privacy design. That means that no intermediary can track the interactions between stakeholders. In addition, Quark ID is \u201call in one\u201d, meaning that all verifiable credentials and attestations are stored in a single mobile application. No one but the users have access to the credential information and it is up to them to decide what data to send to each person or organization. QUARK ID\u2019S MISSION Being an interoperable, open, permissive digital security framework, it is intended that any jurisdiction can adopt it. It seeks to give rise to a new paradigm in which new transactions are secure and agile. This is based on the principle that people are the ones who control their identity, and they are the ones who decide where their information is stored. BASIC PRINCIPLES OF QUARK ID  Open standards SSI protocol Multichain Interoperable Off-chain private data Autonomous governance A growing public/private ecosystem Government user vs. government user  QUARK ID: AN ECOSYSTEM An ecosystem is being generated. Many companies and municipalities started to get interested.
