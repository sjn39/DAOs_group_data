The purpose of this alliance is to help ensure that Gitcoin and Prime can work together to build tooling for DAO2DAO coordination.  Motivation Gitcoin\u2019s vision is to upgrade society\u2019s capabilities to coordinate - with the hope of defeating coordination failure altogether. The next frontier of coordination is DAO-to-DAO interaction. For a D2D ecosystem to flourish, it needs proper tooling to support new ways for DAOs to experiment with collaboration and joint ventures. As a DAO of DAOs, Gitcoin is already a hub for inter-DAO coordination. It\u2019s a natural home for R&D of coordination tools, including mechanisms like Quadratic Funding, that have already impacted the entire web3 space. What is Prime? PrimeDAO is a collective of Web3 builders and DAOists dedicated to researching and building next-generation coordination tools for the Web3 ecosystem. PrimeDAO is working on a product suite which aims to provide collaboration-as-a-service, which include: Prime Launch: A decentralized and curated token offering platform powered by Balancer V 2.0 that enables fair and user-friendly token launches.

Proposal Inverter: A new funding receiver primitive that will allow DAOs to pool resources and co-fund open research/crowdfunded initiatives through semi-automated payment flows. Prime Rating: A permissionless framework for quantifying DeFi protocol risk and quality and a research hub for DAO enthusiasts. Prime Pools: An interface that facilitates the creation and management of DAO-governed liquidity pools which can enable the bridging of liquidity between allied ecosystems and creation of index pools.

We want to establish PrimeDAO as a hub for DAOs to come together and co-build DAO toolings and services. We have seeded this vision in our culture by collaborating with DAOs across multiple phases of researching, designing, and developing our products. As we move forward with our PRIME ($D2D) token launch, we want to signal our intent to make PrimeDAO a DAO co-habitation space by sharing ownership and securing long-term alignment with DAOs we will be closely working with, and we hope to have Gitcoin as one of our core partners in this journey.

But overall I think it\u2019s a good initiative with low cost/risk, and PrimeDAO builders/projects seem to align with Gitcoin pretty well. ",

                    "content": " Summary This proposal, if passed, would issue 50,000 GTC for governance rights equating to 5% of Developer DAO when governance is live. The purpose of this alliance is to help ensure that Gitcoin and Developer DAO can work together to coordinate bringing more web2 developers into web3 than ever before through education and events, as well as supporting the creation and distribution of public goods.  Motivation Gitcoin\u2019s mission is to build & fund the open web. For the open web to continue to grow and realize its potential, we need spaces where existing builders are supported to learn and contribute and new audiences of builders are inspired to take on the challenges and opportunities of web3. Gitcoin is one such space where developers learn and earn. As a DAO of DAOs, it can also support new organizations in ways that help the web3 space on the whole. We\u2019ve been heartened to see this already happening with its support of CLR Fund for the purpose of quadratic funding client diversity. What is Developer DAO? Developer DAO was started by me (Nader Dabit). In just over two months we have grown to 5436 members, mostly experienced builders taking their first steps into the open web. Our goals are to onboard, educate and support these new builders to foster & build web3 tools and public goods. These ambitions resonate well with projects and workstreams Gitcoin has previously supported such as Moonshot Collective, and we have already found some great ways to collaborate on a smaller scale. We see this relationship complementing Gitcoin in the following ways:  Enabling Gitcoin to have a voice in the future direction of Developer DAO via 5% allocation of their governance token into the Gitcoin Treasury Strengthening ties between and improve the shared bandwidth of Gitcoin and Developer DAO teams (Moonshot Coordinator, Austin Griffith, Nader Dabit, Cooper Turley, Preethi Kasireddy, kempsterrrr) Collaborating on educational initiatives including workshops, events and hackathons with Austrin Griffith and the Moonshot Collective workstream, to further the reach and impact of Gitcoin\u2019s public goods mission (building for human thriving) Co-creating prototypes between Moonshot + Developer DAO that play well with the Loot ecosystem vibes / memes   Specification The passing of this proposal would transfer 50,000 GTC to 0x7128f5ff32eD07Ce12E6a9deBE32BB40F9884b3C, Developer DAO\u2019s specified Treasury address. On the launch of Developer DAO\u2019s governance token, a 5% allocation would be transferred to 0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6, Gitcoin\u2019s multisig address for easier delegation / voting. Use of Funds To ensure long term alignment, Developer DAO will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Gitcoin ecosystem. To ensure long term alignment, Gitcoin will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Developer DAO ecosystem.  Benefits See \u201cMotivation\u201d section above  Drawbacks 50,000 GTC would be removed from the treasury. ",
