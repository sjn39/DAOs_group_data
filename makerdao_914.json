Just a brief legal disclaimer before we kick things off. This report is for informational purposes only. It does not constitute financial, investment, legal, regulatory, or tax advice.   Overview of Monthly Results - March 20221557\u00d71077 169 KB   The protocol earned 6 million in revenue last month, a 15% decrease vs. the prior month and a 31% decrease in the prior year. Last March was an extremely bullish period that saw ETH-A rates rise by 5.5%. That means a 13% decrease in net interest income becomes much more palatable with current ETH-A rates: 60% lower today. On-chain workforce expenses increased 37% from last month, driven by the timing of the PE budget draw, which had February\u2019s budget captured in March and March\u2019s budget. One of the few bright spots is that our Oracle Gas costs decreased 45% last month due to a much lower NFT trading volume and minting volume across Ethereum.   Reconciliation of Monthly and Quarterly Results - March 2022 vs. Prior Month &amp; QoQ1558\u00d71075 170 KB   Here is a brief month over month and quarter over quarter, showing the walk from our recurring net protocol income, which captures stability fees and operating expenses, down to our March income. We have a walk from February to March showing that the largest driver is increased workforce expenses. And with a modest offset on lower gas expenses. We see a much higher driver coming from the change in our assets or risk weight assets on the quarter of a quarter view. Then a much more modest offset on the Oracle gas expense side.   Overview of Lending Business - March 20221550\u00d71076 172 KB   We see an ongoing decline in Dai denominated vault collateral sizes and a loss of market share in the lending business. This is mainly because we are not in a full bull market. We have a healthy share between ETH and WBTC even if WBTC is significantly down.   Overview of Balance Sheet Assets - March 20221552\u00d71074 142 KB   We have a small increase in the total yield-bearing assets in the overview of the balance sheet assets. Some Gelato pools are not yielding a lot. One is counted as a yield-bearing asset because it is a loan. We have 62 people that are in USDC. We have much liquidity. That is very good for the peg. The bad part is that we are not generating much revenue from this part.   Overview of Key Risk Metrics - March 20221557\u00d71072 147 KB   From the risk metrics perspective, it has not been a big difference since the last month. The capitalization ratio, surplus buffer or equity, is divided by the yield-bearing assets. That is risky if you include USDC; we are still at three 2.3%, which is not a lot if you want, but still very high compared to historical numbers. One reason is that we do not have a lot of crypto loans outstanding. That is the main issue. The leverage ratio, which is equity divided by all the assets that we have, USDC, PSM, and the crypto loans, has been flat over the last year, more or less, just below 1%.   Overview of ETH Market Share - March 20221552\u00d71074 170 KB   To talk more about the market dynamics. We will go through an overview of the different market share trends and talk about trends on Arbitrum. Here, the prevailing trend in the ETH lending market is one of decline, month on month, quarter on quarter, and year on year. We are flagging the last day of March because there was a significant move in market share literally on the 31st of March, with Nexo moving ETH in and out of vaults. This created a little bit of churn there at the end. One thing worth highlighting from this slide is that in this environment of depressed lending demand, Aave is gaining many shares, largely driven by its liquidity mining incentives. The story is trying to weather the storm, look for growth where it occurs, nurture the whales and make sure that they do not leave the vaults and stop generating revenue for the protocol. Hopefully, wait for Aave to stop pumping money and sending it to people one day.   Overview of WBTC Market Share - March 20221556\u00d71073 166 KB   On wrap WBTC, it is an environment contrary to the one you see in ETH, where lending demand is increasing quite nicely year on year. Aave takes the crown for growth entirely because of the last-minute move again by Nexo, withdrawing 100% of their BTC vaults but intending to reposition them into the protocol eventually. We are hoping to see this move back into the vaults in April. This slide highlights the vulnerability we face in this space and shows how competitive it is. Barriers to entry and exit are essentially zero. This is a very competitive rate-driven space where whales hold sway. It will be important to keep an eye on those in the following months.   Stablecoins on Arbitrum - March 20221560\u00d71077 103 KB   There is an impressive stablecoin growth store in Arbitrum. As Arbitrum, in general, is peeling away from the rest of the L2s in terms of total value lock. The recent run-up that you see towards the end, starting in mid-March, is largely due to the acceleration from the launch of the Stargate Bridge as of the mid of last month. The good news is that our team and PE are in touch with Stargate. I will not speak for how advanced those discussions are. The idea would be to have Dai listed on Stargate, as it cleared the 2 billion dollar value locked mark and keeps going.   3+9 Forecast for FY2022 - March 20221554\u00d71074 158 KB   We are showing a 3+9 forecast for the full year 2022. We break out the interest income on loan balances and the generated interest income. We are looking at things quarterly. So this is full-year actuals for 2021 plus a forecast for 2022. In other words, this full-year 2022 figure, as actuals of Q1 and the forecast for the rest of the year. We have built up the assumptions with as much conservatism as we can stomach. We are looking at a relatively flat ETH lending market, which would be an improvement relative to the lending market today. We hope that these balances are essentially an average the year over the year. We hope that these balances stabilize as the year moves on. There is one major catalyst with the merge and uncertainty on what that will do to lending demand. If it accelerates lending demand and stETH and Maker are uncompetitive, market share gains might accelerate. For Aave, for example, were able to take some of that share, it might turn the trend around and start building the vaults in ETH again. On WBTC, assuming that Nexo returns the BTC into the vault, we are projecting good growth on the back of general BTC market growth. RWA is starting from a very small base as the foundations were built in 2021. They began in April 2021. They did not show up in Q1 of last year. We hope to hit an average of 300 million that is eating a vault capacity throughout the year, which would imply about 600 million towards the end of the year. And then other captures; all the other vaults that generate less yield. We forecast around 40 million Dai in interest income for ETH and WBTC. With another 20 from RWA and the other vaults in the system. This highlights the story. It is important to nurture and grow the whales. We need to be able to make much more comprehensive rent revenue-generating bets. Regarding expenses, it is worth highlighting that 2021 is understated because of the foundation\u2019s dissolution in the middle of the year. Some of these expenses are understated. It is not like the protocol was legitimately running with only 70 million Dai last year. The expenses increased, but it is important not to focus on the absolute amount but instead think about the expenses in ROI turns and look to invest in where they can get the maximum amount of growth possible. This particular environment that we are in is relatively sideways and volatile but challenging to work in. Expenses, particularly salary expenses, tend to have quite a static nature. So this operating expenses line is a fixed liability because the whole protocol is priced in Dai terms, and then the rest of the revenue items are floating relative to Dai. There is a strong exchange rate effect there. As we think about putting these expenses together, it is important to think of them in ROI terms and transparently communicate how those expenses are performing to the Maker holders to hopefully avoid a lot of the fiery back and forth that we have had some of the budget expansion requests. Finally, one thing that is worth flagging, we are not showing a balance sheet picture here. Currently, our balance sheet is yielding very little. And this is a huge opportunity cost that we are incurring as a protocol. It will improve the resilience of the protocol and overall profitability to increase the asset productivity by putting the balance sheet of stablecoins to work, putting our treasury to work. These revenues are diversified, acting as volatility cushions when the markets go up and down. Investing in real-world short-term bonds also has the added benefit of being less correlated to the overall crypto market, providing a stable source of revenue.   Questions 25:09  LongForWisedom: I appreciate the presentation. Maybe we can talk about financial forecasts.  Someone: These are forecasts for the end of the year. We want to highlight that ETH balances were projecting them to be flat, on average, flat relative to the end of March of this year. This would be a gain relative to the trend, given that the lending market is compressing, but we do not know what the lending market will do in the coming months. The key takeaway is to focus on driving as much growth as possible with every expense we make and focus less on the absolute expenses and more on productivity. Making more revenue-generating bets are very important. Related to this asset productivity question, we need to have more conviction and make more revenue-generating bets with the expenses that we are incurring to improve the long-term potential of some of these bets to become a real source of growth. If you look at the RWA\u2019s picture, we are operating in a credit deficit environment where the rates are low, with more competition to get even lower. It is important to get these values as large as possible and as large as we can. The benefit of the RWA space is that it is uncorrelated to crypto. This is a big advantage of this asset clause. I do not have an honest answer for how you nurture the whales. Rates will be a big feature of keeping them attracted or linked to a protocol. The reality is that it is very easy for whales to switch from one to the other. Marketing CU might help increase demand for Dai. In this regard, Maker has a key advantage relative to some of its lending peers, such as Aave and Compound. Now we have a stablecoin that has or should have organic demand around it. The more demand and activity there is for Dai, the more interesting it will be for people to collateralize their crypto loans to create Dai. Aes: We are doing much research as a team into the segmentation of our customers versus Aave and Compound. We are also looking at the different markets for those customers, further digging into on-chain research and analyzing what those people are using Dai and other stablecoins for. In doing so, we can better position the vault as a product. We are talking to growth a lot about these research activities. Hopefully, we will have more to share in the coming months.    28:58  Kianga Daveringston: In terms of the whales, how much behind the scenes do we know who the individuals are? How can we directly communicate with and market to them? In our open community, are we doing that? It is an advantage to have those personal relationships.  Nadia Alvarez: We have a personal relationship where the biggest whales are Nexo and Celsius. We have a personal relationship with them. We are in constant communication with them and receive feedback from them. Thanks to them, we thought about the creation of the institutional vaults. As someone mentioned in the chat, they care about rates, predictability, and capital efficiency. That is what they are looking for. With the institutional vaults, we are trying to give them a product that will solve that. We are in conversations with the users of the protocol that have the largest vault but not the size of the whales. One of them is Gnosis, which has a huge vault with a stETH. When we talk with DAOs that have vaults within Maker, and if we want to do something else with them so they can increase their position, we have to give them something in return. We are considering onboarding their token as collateral, and in return, they have to mint at least X amount of Dai and keep it for one year, or I do not know how long. So we are trying to do this kind of thing. You are right. These whales need our one-to-one support.    31:53  Frank: For the Strategic CU, when thinking about bets and there is the possibility to take on some more risk, should the CU be hiring more? I see many other side chains or L1s deploying all these platforms, and most of the time, they are doing liquidity mining with USDC and USDT. It is frustrating. I get it. You do not want non-canonical Dai to go all over because it gets messy. So, when thinking in bets, how do you feel about CUs hiring more folks so we can keep up with all of these platforms that are raising a quarter of a billion dollars in 48 hours, which is bananas?  Aes: For hiring, it goes back to the ROI. What value is being created by the CU or the expansion of the CU? What problem are they solving? Are they bringing on new revenue? Are they just a cost side but making things more efficient operationally, indirectly leading to more revenue? It is hard to make a blanket statement one way or the other. On the product side, the more we expand and do R&D products, the higher revenue we will generate in making some of these revenue bets. For example, I would hate to underinvest in engineering, especially when we have all these D3Ms and MCDs on L2s and other chains in the pipeline that can drive a lot of organic Dai and revenue growth with the new vaults. Someone: There was a comment earlier in the chats from Lucas asking whether it was cash or accrued type of expenses. One of the disadvantages of transparency in the blockchain space is that these expenses will hit early, and the benefits will be felt later. When you invest in technology, for example, in a regular company, you might find ways to smooth it over by capitalizing on balance sheets; we do not do this in the blockchain. This is worth keeping in mind when you are discussing. So, to PaperImperium\u2019s point, most of this is cash. It is challenging and near impossible to grow. This is worth bearing in mind when we think about budget requests. The final message is to think about the volatility of this market which might turn, and make sure that we are positioned well to take advantage of the upturns. If I misspoke and said Nexo BTC went to Aave, I was referring to a general example of whales going towards it. This was not a specific example.     MIP66: Pairwyse Licensure  Akiva Dubrofsky  MIP66: Pairwyse Licensure1920\u00d71085 91.3 KB  35:58  Hi, everyone. I will tell you a bit about the MIP. We have submitted MIP66. One of the key aspects of MIP66 is joint business development to promote fixed-rate Dai. We believe that fixed-rate Dai is essential to the development of Maker. Not only fixed-rate vault but also fixed-rate Dai. We did that because all financial institutions match their assets and liabilities. Maker DAO is no different. Part of matching your assets and liabilities is matching floating to floating and fix to fix. We see that Maker has a lot of floating assets and floating liabilities right now. It will also need to have fixed assets and fixed liabilities. Part of doing that is using interest rate derivatives. We developed the product for MakerDAO over the past couple of years, which will allow for fixing interest rates without interfering with any of the core Maker code. Somewhat the same way people use money legos and abstract over different protocols. We can abstract MakerDAO similarly with these money legos, creating fixed rates. We believe that this is beneficial from the perspective of assets and liabilities and the perspective of decentralization. It is important to have composable instruments and not tie everything into the same codebase. It is also important to have fixed-rate protocols that abstract over MakerDAO rather than going into the core plumbing. That is why we developed this product. One of the key parts of developing a fixed-rate ecosystem around Maker, and we are ready to go and start doing this right away, as soon as the MIP passes, is this business development. We partnered with two regulated investment banks. One is first Penny Investments in Australia, and the other one is True Altitude in the UK. And using those partnerships, we believe we can grow MakerDAO\u2019s pipeline of fixed-rate investors. All primary largely in those jurisdictions, the UK and Australia, and other places worldwide because those companies also have a presence in UAE and Switzerland. For MakerDAO to achieve maximum stability and decentralization, it is important to have multiple fixed-rate ecosystems, not just one. To get there, we need strong business development and strong decentralization, and that is why we propose that if the MIP passes will also open up our patents to the community, which two of them have been granted. We are willing to open those up to the community. We want to create an open fixed-rate ecosystem or Maker to see DeFi thrive. I will leave it like that if you guys have any questions.   Discussion  Dai Market Share & Liquidity 39:52  Dai Market-Share/Liquidity-Curve Pools &amp; More1920\u00d71078 184 KB   Sam: This is about the recent news of the 4Pool trying to replace the 3Pool on Curve. People that read Crypto Twitter are probably aware of this. This topic is about what we want our response to be\u2014thinking about the ramifications of potentially losing the 3Pool and possible solutions. Niklas Kunkel: Is 3Pool going to survive? It will be something between a 4pool and a 2Pool. How much does it affect us in the short term and the long term? Can we do something about that, and should we? In terms of the peg, we do not struggle with that slightest. We have enormous gobs of liquidity in the PSM that exceed 3X the amount of liquidity currently in 3Pool. 4Pool, we would have never wanted to join because it is UST rug risk.  The way it works with a Curve Pool is you have almost full exposure to whatever is the weakest link in the token pool. In terms of 2Pool, there is not much we can do about that. I see what you mean by Dai plus 4Pool. But the problem is that nobody wants to incentivize that. It works right on Curve because the projects want to incentivize liquidity for their token. They acquire or bribe Curve voters in some way. Without those bribes or votes, you would never get the Dai pool to have enough yield right for any amount of liquidity to build up. Then, should MakerDAO try to get a stake in Curve voting? I would say. One, it is expensive. And two, it is one of those things where the people that got in early got the best chess position here. We would never build up a significant enough stake to swing our ding dong around. Then you can look at it and say, how likely is Curve to be the DEX of tomorrow, three years from now, or five years from now? That is quite questionable. We have seen much jockeying between DEXs, or even DEX aggregators over the years. Nothing tells me that Curve will be the central hub of liquidity forever. Through G-UNI, the increasing debt ceilings, and the amount of leverage that we allow, we have already started building up significant sums of liquidity in the Uniswap V3. That will continue. From a peg and liquidity point of view, it is entirely irrelevant. We are already building up liquidity on Uniswap. The only thing you could argue is, from a user point of view, will they not be exposed to Dai? Because Dai is not in the Curve 4Pool or the Curve 2Pool. I do not know how to answer that. I do not know what the value of something like that is. Looking at all the information, I do not think we have to do anything. Terra is trying to hype this up into being something bigger than it is. It is suitable for them. But it does not matter to us that much.   Sam: This is less of an actual issue for the protocol. It is more of like a marketing PR problem. I do not think it looks great to do anything. If we could make an easy response, I think that could potentially work. One idea that has been thrown around is that they have 4Pool. We can make 5Pool with BUSD, USDC, USDP, and a couple of others, which I am not thinking off the top of my head. This could be a narrative shift in our favor. We would not have to spend anything. We would redirect some of the PSM supply into this 5Pool and give high leverage on it to fill up even with low fees. We do not need to worry too much about rewards. This is a potential option. Niklas Kunkel: I do not think that could work, Sam. The Curve fees are irrelevant. The Curve liquidity is almost 100% dependent on the incentives Cannon is being pointed at a pool. Sam: The fees can be essentially nothing. We can set the leverage as high as we want because it is the same as the PSM. We could set it to even 1,000X, and it will fill up. We can fill it to whatever number we want, as long as we have PSM supply. There is an additional benefit. Curve has become less friendly with us. This may be a nod to them that we want to continue working together. This is for marketing PR reasons and stuff like that, but it could be a good move. It does not require much engineering effort, and it could be an easy win. Niklas Kunkel: From an asset risk exposure point of view, it would be as strong as the weakest asset. If any one of those gets rugged, you get rugged for the entire exposure you have to that pool. If you are willing to take on risk exposure to each of those coins, it would be better to create a PSM for each of those. And then you segment out the risk. If any one of those fails, you only lose that particular segment instead of the entire thing. Plus, it sets us up positionally better if we have this entire network of PSMs. Eventually, it evolves into its Curve competitor, at least from a stablecoin point of view.  48:39  Nadia Alvarez: I like Sam\u2019s idea from a narrative perspective. Everyone is complaining that we are doing nothing against Terra, which is good because Maker is not Terra\u2019s competitor. We are more than just a stablecoin. It will be great for our responses to the crypto and DeFi community to see what we can do with the Rari pools and other stablecoins, like Fei or MAI, which did not join the Cure 4Pool. Suppose we could use the Cure LPToken with the 4Pool plus Dai or 3Pool plus something. Or create a new pool and use it for leverage and give them a zero stability fee. That will create a message around what are the things that Maker is doing. We must start doing things for our community and the external creator community. We need to start being less risk-averse. Niklas Kunkel: I completely disagree with you guys. But I love and respect you guys. S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: We are missing the point. We might lose 1.5 billion of Dai demand if a 3Pool disappears and Dai is not kept. This is not a big problem because we are not doing anything with those 1.5 billion. They are just sitting as USDC in the PSM. They will disappear. It is not a big deal because we are not doing anything. But the problem is that we are not using the PSM. I understand that we can use all this liquidity to provide leverage to initiate some like we are doing for the Gelato Dai USDC pairs, and it is providing liquidity; we can do much stuff. However, that is useless at the end of the day because it is not generating anything. If you want to be useful, we should use all the assets on the balance sheets, get revenues, and give those revenues to Dai we lost. Then, we can fight because of the stablecoin works. The next step is more about giving yield to customers. We have no idea how to do that securely. Someone: We should not dismiss a losing demand. We should plan to grow the interest-bearing Dai supply to meet the demand. That should be our outlook. We should fight someone to keep this demand even though it is just sitting in the PSM for now. Niklas Kunkel: The PSM is dormant capital right now. Presumably, we will find a way to earn yield off that in the future. Keeping up a healthy amount of capital in the PSM is objectively excellent. Someone: This could be a simple message that the crypto media will pick up. Maker response to 4Pool with 5Pool. It is simple and dumb, but people get it. Niklas Kunkel: Here is where I disagree. Now you compare 4Pool and 5Pool, and 5Pool will look like a joke compared to 4Pool. The narrative looks even worse because now we tried to compete, and by the numbers, we lost. Someone: Why would it be a joke? We can crank the TVL to whatever we want as long as there is a PSM room. Niklas Kunkel: Nobody will use it. We will be the only ones using it, and the yield will be nothing. It will be like this dead pool that no one uses. Look at the LPs. It would be one LP, and it would be MakerDAO. S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Listen to Sam. He is saying that Curve is not a DEX. No one is using Curve for anything. It is a way to reward the LPs. You have incentivized the usage of your token by bribing. I am not an expert on CRV, but you are giving a reward on the token. It is more a saving account than anything else. LongForWisdom: To clarify, who is Sam? S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Sam is the co-founder of Frax. He was calling MakerDAO as he wanted to create a PSM with us, and we did not move on this point. Because Frax is another model, it does not fit well with us.  54:58  Niklas Kunkel: I want to caution against starting to do risky things because we feel like we are not degen enough for some narrative. We have never been under the Degen protocol. We have been the risk-averse protocol, which has gotten us to what we are today. It is better to have that property that we can hoist up than to start trying to do degen stuff and still not be as degen as other protocols. They get more growth out of it. But now, we are neither low risk nor high growth. We are in this murky middle where we do not want to be. Someone: I agree. This is not risky at all. Whether the stablecoins are sitting in the PSM or Curve, it is just a matter of they are paying Curve fees. That is the only difference. It is not riskier to hold this stuff in the PSM or Curve. Niklas Kunkel: You still have this homogenous exposure to all of the tokens in that pool compared to having them individually in a PSM. Someone: It is the same risk profile? LongForWisdom: You do, but they are all centralized. Niklas Kunkel: We talked earlier about how we will find a way to monetize the PSM. So having that liquidity in a PSM versus having that liquidity in Curve, I know where I would rather have the liquidity because we can monetize it one day. Mark: To briefly put some numbers on this. Curve had 27.6 million in volume traded through the 3Pool, and the Uniswap v3 pool had a 26 million Dai USDC pair. It has got less than 10% of the TVL. But it is doing effectively the same trading volume. I am not overly worried about Curve 3Pool decreasing significantly, impacting our peg.  57:41  Nadia Alvarez: I am not worried about the 4Pool, but more about the 2Pool because Curve is thinking about excluding Dai in the future deployments of this pool, which is a risk for us. If we see what happened in Arbitrum, where the 3Pool does not exist, we struggle with that liquidity on Arbitrum. Maybe we can solve that by deploying Maker pools everywhere. I do not think we can do that now. But Curve can deploy the 2Pool tomorrow if they want. I want all to be aware of that and the risk that we have about not having Dai included in the 3Pool in the next deployments of Curve in their multi-change strategy because I think that that could be a problem with Dai liquidity, not on mainnet, but L2s and sidechains. Someone: Let us avoid this defeatist attitude that we are bad at marketing. We got to try. We got to work on things that we are not good at instead of saying we are not good at them and are not even going to try.  59:43  LongForWisdom: Does anyone else have any comments? We can talk about liquidity more generally. If we do not have the Curve pools on the L2s and other chains, in what other ways can we ensure Dai liquidity on those chains? Someone: We should message to the DeFi community that we are up for collaboration and this type of initiative. Part of being the boomer coin, or whatever the name, is that we do not do anything. We do not react. We mint Dai. We have a chance to start changing this and be a bit more proactive. Although it is a risky move, it can also give us a nice image for the DeFi community. Someone: I agree. Our public perception is that we do not care, and we snub other protocols. It would be nice to try and change that. Someone: We have plenty of levers to use to model the risks. Let us use them. We should use those levers and try new things. When I say try is doing with a purpose, not just for doing it. We need to do this right. S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: I have a suggestion about making things without protocols. There was Fei on the forum asking for PSM. So I am not sure having a PSM with them was a smart move, but we might want to open them a vault so they overcollateralize Dai as they borrow Dai. And we can get rewards for that. They agree to pay. They said that in the forum. So we can get a newer collateralize Dai loan to fade with an interest rate, which is better than the PSM. No one replied to that. Maybe we can move on that front. Make collaboration with Tribe. Niklas Kunkel: What is the use case for a borrower? Does Dai have significantly better yield opportunities than Fei? S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: It is not about that. Fei is in institutions that have much equity. They have a big surplus buffer of 300 or 400 million. But they have a little failed demand currently. But they are excellent at investing in those assets better than us because they move faster and take a bit more risk. They have more liquidity issues, and that is that they are always needing some dimes. Currently, they have only 20 million Dai for their PSM. They have the same PSM as us. If we give them 100 million, they will be able to invest them in whatever ways they want. It will still be safe for us because they have so much equity.  1:03:37  Someone: I try to stay out of these things. Just be careful about reacting. Only react fast if necessary. Do something stronger. Think about it. I have not looked at this particular issue. But I think it is indicative of a larger issue, which was related to Maker competitiveness, that we are not addressing. We are getting trapped in our issues, and we need to find a way to move forward on them. Figure out first is this a real issue we need to deal with? Is it the real issue? Or can we make a stronger move that silences this and does something bigger and more important for us? Do not let your opponent dictate what you will do. Do what you are going to do and let your opponent react. That is just my opinion. Someone: I agree with that. We could do both. I am suggesting this because it is not like much effort. And we will have some side benefits that come from it, improving the relationship with Curve. Someone: I want to comment on the Curve thing. I think it is entirely unclear to me, given this move, whether somehow we can get on the Curve\u2019s good side. There are some difficult waters here to navigate in both a political and financial sense. When I first thought about it, I was like, let us do a deal with Balancer and have them do a 3Pool with really low fees. I mean, let us take it off Curve and move over. I have not looked at this particular issue. Perhaps some creative thinking here is more important than making a fast and quick, easy reaction that may not be as strong as you think. Someone: I believe they will like it because they are getting more fees. They have another pool. The fees are going through there as opposed to the PSM. Niklas Kunkel: You guys are missing the point. Liquidity swap fees are irrelevant. It is just the token emission. Makerman: Let me add here. This is something I have been harping on for a while. When trying to compete with this kind of farming liquidity they are throwing out, you look at their numbers, which is not sustainable. I look at it across the board, not sustainable. But Maker has not even tried to enter the game sustainably. It is one of the reasons why I finally threw out Maker 3.0. Let us get into this game, let us do it sustainably, and let us have a real message that is to send about what we are going to do with Dai. That is just my opinion. I go wherever the DAO goes, as much as I can. It is a greater strategy we are trying to solve here. I do not know if we can deal with this one issue with one move. We might not make Curve happy with us somehow.  1:07:41  Nadia Alvarez: There is something that we did not discuss. I was joking about adding the 4Pool as collateral. It was a joke, of course. What if we are more flexible with USDT. The community does not like that idea. If we onboard as collateral the 3Pool, that will be an interesting move. But of course, we have to accept USDT in our system. Something to think about. Someone: It is not the same as full exposure to USDT there. We would not offer crazy leverage on that one, maybe. So we can sustain a bit of a hit and potentially even hook it into rewards. Not saying this is necessarily a good use of time, but just spitballing here. LongForWisdom: That echoes monetsupply\u2019s point. 3Pool is equivalent to USDT exposure. All these pools it is good as the weakest component. If one component fails, then the pool empties, and it is all of that component. Niklas Kunkel: To put it into perspective, the swap fees as a percentage on 3Pool, is 0.15%. Even trying to lever that up, the yield is nothing even if we do zero civility fees on it. Someone: You can always find a number. We can go as high leverage as we need to. Niklas Kunkel: That is what I am saying. It is 0.15% right now. If you allow people to get leverage and put liquidity in there, they will not do it because the yield will be low. And even after you start putting liquidity in there, the yield just gets more shit. Someone: Yes, but 0.15% at 100x leverage is 15%. It is not anything. Niklas Kunkel: You will not get 15%. You will get 2 or 3%. Because after adding, you have diluted the pool by that much. Someone: Turn it up to 1000. There is a number you can hit. LongForWisdom: Nick, you are comparing the current API on our 3Pool, which already has 3 billion of liquidity in it. So it is 0.15 on 3 billion. So if it was a new pool with nothing in it, it is potentially way more than that. Someone: Monetsupply is right too. The un-levered people would leave. Niklas Kunkel: Also, the volume going through that pool. Maybe we will find ourselves, but I do not know how much of that pool\u2019s volume is tokens going from Dai or to Dai. There is no 2Pool right now. All of the trading going from USDC to USDT, or USDT to USDC, Dai is getting the free ride, in terms of the LPs of 3Pool or putting in Dai get to intercept the trading fees from USDC to USDT and vice versa. If the liquidity starts to disappear and starts going towards 4Pool, that 15 BIP reward APY could potentially even go lower because all of a sudden, we have to survive off of the yield of just Dai trading. We do not get to leech off the USDC to USDT portion of the trades, which will exclusively be happening inside 4Pool if this whole scheme comes to pass. It is all interconnected. LongForWisdom: That fight is stupid, for sure. If we fix each other, we potentially lose a bunch of volume. Niklas Kunkel: I am not trying to sound like a defeatist here and shoot down everything. I am more in line with what MakerMan was saying and that this is not worth our time to respond to. It is a foregone conclusion. We should focus on what we are good at and our targeting. That will make a difference for us and more than some narrative stuff, which, even if we go in this direction, we are still not guaranteed to achieve. It is more deterministic LongForWisdom: I do not think anyone mentioned this yet. One of the potential benefits I see is that it gives other tokens on Curve; other options to pair against. One of the problems with the current options is that they are all slightly not good for various reasons. 3Pool has Tether. 2Pool, if it comes in, will have Tether. 4Pool, if it comes in, it has Tether and Trax, and UST. If we open the pool, it would have Dai against centralized stables that do all have some level of trust, like USDC, Pax, GSD, etc. Then that is an option for other people to pair against. That does not, in theory, require exposure to Tether or Frax and USD. That does not exist currently. I do not know if that is something people would value. Niklas Kunkel: That is a fair point.   Conclusion  LongForWisdom 1:15:16  Let us wrap up. Thanks to everyone for joining us. I hope you enjoyed the discussion. We will see you all next week.

This is the 188 Scientific Governance and Risk meeting at MakerDAO. My name is Payton. I am one of the governance facilitators, and I go by Prose11 online. I am joined here by amazing people interested in contributing to the Maker protocol. Today is April 28th, 2022; this is our weekly call. This session is being recorded. There is a raise hand function in Zoom. If you are unable or otherwise unwilling to hop on the mic, you can always drop a comment in chat. With that said, this is intended to be an open meeting. We want your input and questions. I will go over the agenda to give you an idea of our discussion. If we have time, there will be an open discussion section: save your comments or drop them in the chat if there\u2019s something unrelated you would like to discuss: awesome. We will start over with the governance Roundup, go over Votes, Maker improvement proposals, and what is going on in the forum. We have initiative update reports that would be great to see and discuss, from conference collateral management to our sustainability questionnaire, from assisting the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit. Our main discussion will be on managing our CU. Those are structures for organizing the DAO and how the work primarily gets done in the current paradigm.

David Utrobin: It is a little funny that I am introducing it because my team decided not to go to Amsterdam, which was hard considering how many people from the DAO were going. Lots of different teams went. Lenka from SCS provided an excellent summary on the forum that I believe Prose11 will break down for us. Feel free to share your experience and pass the mic over.   I know we got into my individual experience a little bit with last week\u2019s call talking about the global governance gathering and Dennis presenting his and Thiagos\u2019s workshop on Governance which was very fun. That was the highlight of my experience, other than meeting many wonderful Maker people for the first time. Shout out to everyone who could grab a coffee or meet up with me and one of the events attending was fun. We had quite the house back there. It was great to see so many Maker people from different teams; we had recognized delegates, just people generally interested in the protocol, kind of all together in one place. Lenkla\u2019s post because I thought she did an excellent job summarizing. David has already posted some key talks out of Amsterdam. Devconnects was a little unique. Several different conferences were occurring across other focus areas over two weeks. There are many opportunities to select what you are interested in. I was at the Global Governance gathering, so we got to see many of those mentioned on Tuesday, including Lenkla\u2019s office hours. Wouter did a talk on bringing Dunbar\u2019s barrier. That\u2019s the number of social interactions humans can keep track of, which is pretty cool. These recordings and the links are in the chat if you want to take a look. We got a special preview of Dennis\u2019s presentation last week. The L2 guys from Protocol Engineering were also there. I heard many good talks and watched the recording, but it sounded pretty interesting with a risk framework. If you\u2019re familiar with L2, that is a great site: how the different L2 are developing and what backgrounds and implementations they are utilizing to work on, whether roll-ups or something else.  17:59  MEV day was after I left, so I did not see any of these talks live in person. We saw a lot of cool tweet threads on them. We had Sam from Protocol Engineering there, who spoke about wallets, aggregators, and apps and hosted and a moderator for one of the flashbacks of the panel. Some of you might recall that one of the recently recognized delegates began to flash bots. That is just one small sampling of several events and many talks, but these are ones with recordings. If you are interested in any of the ones we brought up, you can check that link. I know a bunch of people were there.  Raphael Spannocchi: I think the whole decentralized nature of the events was amazing because one person did not plan it; it was a global matter. Then, others piled on top and did events in parallel. That was fun.    20:17  At the coworking space, you got to meet a lot of very young, up-and-coming devs that are either looking to build something new, learn, or participate in the hackathon. That was the biggest takeaway: there are many late teens to early 20-year-olds looking to get into the ecosystem. They are out there, and they will build something, and hopefully, they will build on top of MakerDAO. To me, that was the biggest takeaway.  Niklas Kunkel: One of Karthik\u2019s stats during the intro session was that 31% of the participants there had joined crypto last year. They are entirely new: talking to some of these people, their idea of what is crypto and DeFi is quite more segregated than what veterans of the industry might think. One of the ways that it was expressed is that Maker has had a strong brand. We have had a strong association with decentralization and DeFi. There are a lot OGs and veterans that naturally support Dai because it was one of the first functional adapts created on Ethereum. Many of the newbies lack that context, and it shows because many of them have no idea what Maker is, or they have no idea about the association between Dai and Maker. And even for Dai itself, some of them did not even know what Dai was. The lack of marketing that we have right now is affecting us. We must expand on that and invest the resources to do that outreach. This industry is still tiny, and the industry will keep growing. This front-runner OG and cultural advantage that we have will keep diluting with the message about Dai, decentralization, and Maker. There were many great things about the conference, but you can check out our post and see them. In particular, this was one of my takeaways and something that we need to work on.     Offchain Collateral Management  Retro 24:21  Retro: I am Retro from the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit. As a project manager, I support the CMOs initiative, and I am also a part of the resources incubating the Real World Asset CUs. I am here to update the progress that the six initiative teams are making on real-world onboard assets. We will have six milestones for review today. The first milestone was created at the start of the CMOs working group. This milestone ensured that all deals progressing through the Real World Finance pipeline due diligence pipeline transitioned smoothly to this new working group. MS1 will soon conclude since this focus on existing deals and production, updates, and the ability to track it will be captured in the new collateral status index that the CES team has rolled out. Today, we will break up this milestone into two discussion points: the existing deals published on the forum and the pre-MIP deals that the team is working on. I will quickly try to go through much information here for MS1A: existing deals. Since the last update, we have updated this chart to show the recently published MIPS that has moved on from a pre-MIP stage: the Oasis pro markets, MIPS, and HVB. To get some flavor around the work involved and the purpose of forming this milestone, we wanted to capture the work going into the assessments and then improve the process and just servicing the deals. To touch upon topics that occurred while servicing these deals, Monetalis is a great example. The initial assessment was submitted for a MIP6, and the deal evolved based on that initial discussion. The deal status update: Real-World Finance teams have delivered all assessments for the MIP6, MIP65, and MIP68. We are currently waiting on the governance cycle for MIP65 and 68. For Sachin, the work is ongoing for technical and legal mechanisms, and it is currently pending a due diligence review for the proposed Dai and Fiat broker. This set of legal documents is three documents where two are further along than the one, and there is also ongoing work to test the upgraded version of the smart contracts. 6S is another example of some of the team\u2019s challenges in working through evolving deals. Specifically for due diligence, 6S and MIP6 had an assessment delivered.  27:59  MIPS72 was published during the wave of self-contained MIPS that we saw a couple of weeks back. Like Monetalis, they delivered the work, and the team is waiting on a response from success at this time. The Oasis pro markets are the two new deals that the team is planning to release on market comparables to provide the community with a way to assess the deals. LTS is also completing a high-issue spotting review for the initial legal elements of the deal. HVP is currently in a green light polling with three days left. I believe it\u2019s still at 100% voting in favor. The reason to include it on this slide is that it touches on some elements of prioritization. Prioritization has been a big subject matter that our team has identified that more work and definition need to go into: this is just a quick summary of these deals. We see evolving due diligence deals, and the other milestones support new challenges that have come up, making them more mature and robust. Milestone 1B then is the work that the Real-World Asset CUs perform for potential applicants. Since our last update six weeks ago, this process has resulted in one borrower determining that they are not ready yet to engage with the DAO and will reengage at a later date once the organization is better suited to meet our standards. This process has also been formalized with the MIP67 ratification earlier this week. Once the borrower\u2019s MIPS are posted to the forum, the MIPS will go into a production cycle again; the MS1 will be depreciated, so the production cycle of MP is communicated in the CSI. This update has been published to the forum that captures a lot of the information I just provided. This was dated April 8th, and over the past three weeks, I have tried to communicate the latest developments. This will be an excellent resource for the community to keep track of a similar detail that I just provided for deals moving through the pipeline and into production. This is planned to be released on a regular cadence moving forward. The MS2 speaks to the restructuring of the real-world finance CU to highlight the support it needs to onboard billions of dollars of real-world collateral. The initial strategies we presented to the community will develop the lending incubator for portfolio expertise. It will also develop legal and transition services CU for legal expertise. Then, the lending oversight team will support all functions of real-world asset activities. The major update here is that Love is planning their RFC publication for the May 8th deadline and is planning to enter the June cycle. We anticipate that LTS will follow close behind in terms of graduation. MS3 was a focused engagement about revamping the collateral onboarding pipeline for applicants. The work manifested from this milestone could be broken down into four different categories, starting with the MIP76. This defined and solidified the methodology for completing reviews for real-world assets. Again, this was recently ratified. Due to this methodology change, the MIP6 application also needed an amendment with both of those passing. Then, we make sure that applications are up to speed with the new standards. Some of this process the community could have already seen for on-chain collaterals. Robert recently posted and went through the greenlit applications that needed updates asking for them to update or withdraw their application. A similar process will follow for off-chain assets based on the ratification earlier this week of MIPS. All this information is now being communicated through the collateral status index for transparency purposes. Those updates that Robert has been providing have given great clarity to the community and organized the work of the CMAF team providing better structure and engagement points for the different CU stacks this one to support the initiatives. Another part of this is continuous improvement. As a quick preview, we anticipate forming a new milestone that will build on the success already and focus on prioritizing MIP assessments.  33:45  Reviewing what this looks like, then to provide some context for off-chain collateral, the applications shown here are currently submitted or undergoing polling. Applications that have been submitted are pending assessments being released. If the assessment has been released, waiting for the poll to go through. Once they move on to the green light pool, they will be prioritized for assessments sitting in a green light, then move into assessment and further implementation. The list of collaterals needs to be refreshed according to the new methodology and application. As a quick review here, this is the current deals in assessment and implementation to show the pipeline that has been developed. The last slides speak to the maple finance D3M research and development specifically for the legal review. Growth, Protocol Engineering, and CES are leading the integration for Maple finance. Real-World Finance, LTS, and Love support the initiative from a legal and credit standpoint. Christian from the incubating LTS CU spearheaded this. In the last update, he was kicking off this milestone with maple. Since then, work has been made to identify a pool delegate, and LTS is now engaging with this new kind of counterparty for further development. In the background to CES and protocol, have a seat scheduled for the technical challenges that are coming up. The next step is to publish the agreements with recommendations for possible amendments if needed. MS5 is similar to MS4 in terms of legal research. This is for a Centrifuge. LTS, Real-World Finance, and Centrifuge have all worked together to produce an indenture, which will serve as the foundational legal agreement for the new structure. This is in the final reviews by LTS and real-world finance and external legal counsel. MS6 is publishing a report on asset management liability strategies: the goal speaks to doing something for the first time and is a way for Maker to bring new assets to replace USDC. With this real-world, DeFi touchpoint, it\u2019s currently locked. The more discussions we have with counterparties, the more clear that this becomes. Christian and the team are engaging several counterparties to continue the conversations and research, and they are preparing to publish a mid-project report. The anticipated timeline for this milestone to be completed is closer to the end of Q3. To keep the community up to date, we will be publishing some of our findings soon. That does it for our update.  ElPro: Retro, thanks for the presentation. This might be more geared towards RWF, and I brought this up to them because I am seeing some progress being made by other competitors in the RWA realm. Some have been MIPS6 applications posted in the Maker forum; they are now shifting. They pretty much have left anyway. Regardless, they seek a different approach; just wondering if there are always some of these milestones can be? Not necessarily fast track, but there is a possibility that we could get something delivered by June of this year.   Retro: I would have to defer to the Real-World Asset team.  Luca: I do not know if there is somebody from Real-World Assets. We want to do differently from Aave or our competitors when real-world onboarding assets in terms of the medium-term ambition. However, I get Frank\u2019s point. Max has commented here that HVB is currently in the green light process. It has the ambition to complete all the milestones by late June, which will be great for us and subject to the approval of the Governance of the MKR holders. The real-world asset team will do its best to make it happen. I think it is an incredible opportunity. We would like to onboard a regulated bank with billions of dollars to deploy, which excites us, and a regulated bank for which linking with Maker is strategic. This is not comparable to the situation around where they had this toy. They have this project to which they dedicate time, but it is not strategic. And that means that they do not have the same sense of urgency that we do.    40:08  Luca: We still hope that it will be delivered by that time, but it\u2019s not in our hands. At the same time, we are waiting for Oasis promarket to bring the two opportunities they currently have on the forum for the next cycle. This depends on them. If they come in and get approved, they should be in good shape. The D3Ms that we are exploring with Maple and TrueFi are hybrid and have the ambition to go live before the end of Q2. Again, I know that there is frustration because this thing is complex; we raised the bar, which has created much noise initially. We are finally in great shape to deliver something tangible to the community. I get your urgency Frank; I have the same feeling we don\u2019t have. We do not have to strive for perfection. Otherwise, we will never get anything done.  ElPro: I heard it through the grapevine that many banks out there in the EU are more focused on dealing with some of the sanctions than figuring out how to make money in Q2 of 2022. Just a little bit concerned if we are going to sit around and wait for a large institution of banks to come in knocking at the door of MakerDAO or if we\u2019re going to take some affirmative action to take some of these innovative platforms that are starting to ramp upright. I only see a trend that I think will get better. You have prominent - PaperImperium just posted Goldfinch. They onboarded a former MIPS6 applicant of MakerDAO. I appreciate the understanding: this is pending, and looking forward to seeing something get onboarded soon.   Luca: I also think that they\u2019re not necessarily competitors. Onboarding somebody who leaves MakerDAO out is what we would love to do because Goldfinch is a different play; they have other risk appetites, cannot absorb losses, and are not magic managing a currency. We hope that Goldfinch comes to us, and they asked for a D3M in the same way that Maple and TrueFi are thinking about, so this will be our ultimate goal. I know that Will is not on the call, but I know that Will is in contact with the Goldfinch guys, so we would love to explore potential interactions with the protocol, the same way we are doing with TruFi and Maple.  Someone: There has been discussion lately with Goldfinch. We were in talks with them a long time ago, actually less last year, but they had their priorities and time to organize themselves. Now they are also getting a bit more in line with our initiatives. Something coming from Goldfinch similar to D3M initiatives is probably not out of whack. I can assure you that the team has already re-engaged with us.   Someone: I think on the other topic covered with you, Frank, they have an internal target date: once the summer holidays hit France, we will not hear from them for two months. They are doing everything we can to get asked implementational all done and validated before summer starts.   ESG Research  Julian Frede 45:34  I\u2019m here to briefly introduce a survey request related to this ESG research. It\u2019s part of SES research. What are we doing with this research? We pulled out relevant topics about sustainability and Maker.  First step: SES and I discussed the range of topics and discussed which of them were somehow related to Maker, and then we clustered them into seven topic clusters:  Ecological footprint Community Cyber ecosystem Financial inclusion Talent & employer Regulation Strategy & Processes    Second step: In Sustainability, you first speak with the relevant stakeholders about how you see the relevance of these topics. For example, here, on ecological footprint:  960\u00d7540 46.8 KB   You drill that down to different topics in that cluster; for example: how relevant is consider the active management and reduction of CO2 emissions? And that is something you now do in a survey approach. From there, the discussion can start. It\u2019s possible to analyze who sees the topic, different topics, and who sees the topics related here as relevant or not relevant; from there, you can start and implement, discuss, and so on. The goal here is to learn which topics are relevant to the stakeholders.   Juan 48:36  Something very interesting for me when we sent the initial links to the participants was that one of them was like, \u201cWe do not need ESG within Maker,\u201d and you told me this is a very valuable point, and it is something that we want to hear as well. So maybe you can comment on that so that we can get more voices, even from dissenting people. That, for me, was very revealing. And I think it\u2019s important to highlight.   Julian Frede 49:13  We usually use this approach as the standard in Travefy, corporations, and financial institutions to grasp sustainability topics. We get this gloomy normative discussion out of the way and go more on a science-based or methodology systemized approach to this discussion.   Discussion  Core Unit Management  Thomas Flitter 50:48  I\u2019m Thomas Flitter, engagement lead for the GovComms team. Longtime listener, first-time caller, and excited to talk discussion segment today. Our topic today is managing our CU. We stand at 19 CUs, with about 115 employees involved in MakerDAO. And we\u2019re facing some challenges. Many of the CUs have at least one facilitator. They manage many things (objectives and vision, developing strategic initiatives, etc.) and develop and submit budgets to support that CU. And on that \u2014the budget proposals\u2014 have their challenges. We want to take a look today at some of those underlying themes and get some feedback from the folks here on the call to discuss some of these challenges and some of these underlying things? We can structure this in three axes:  960\u00d7540 25.3 KB   When you look at Needs vs. Wants, we are talking about clarity on justification: What do you need versus what do you want. And I want to ask everyone out there: what are some of those challenges? Are we limiting ourselves to what we need versus what we want?  I want to open the floor a little bit to ask folks about what are some of those underlying things you\u2019re facing when you\u2019ve got a budget or budget proposal?  Because those proposals have their challenges, I wanted to open the floor up to start generating some thoughts about some of the challenges of budget proposals.   David Utrobin 53:42  I\u2019d like to open it up first and leave my experience with our team\u2019s last couple of budget proposals. As many of you know, GovComms put up SP62 and SP63 to this month\u2019s government cycle. Thankfully, SP62 passed, but for a short while, it looked like both wouldn\u2019t be passing. The interesting thing is that \u2014from our perspective\u2014 SP63 was part of a larger strategic direction for how our team would like to expand so that we can cover our mandate and do better at really fulfilling our mandate. The challenges that I\u2019ve faced are basically how do I make the case to delegates? The value of the proposal: is it a need or is it a want?  Well: I did present a bit of both. Because on the one hand, it is a need. But it\u2019s kind of hard to define that line. Is it something that needs to be approved now? Or can it be approved in six months? The biggest thing that helped was all of the different conversations I had with delegates. Sharpening my relationship with the delegates was key to getting some of that missing feedback that I wasn\u2019t getting throughout the quarter. It was also key to understanding why my budget proposals were struggling. It was also key to helping align the direction that I have in mind for my team with the direction and expectations that delegates might have for my team.   Thomas Flitter 56:25  Related to Tells vs. Asks, good facilitators better communicate how or why they make decisions and justify their costs. Another thing is to think about Growth vs. Trim. There\u2019s been much discussion about being aggressive vs. conservative, where we want to focus on our spending. What are some of your thoughts and approaches to that question of growth vs. strength? because I know that comes up often.   Payton 57:26  From the Governance angle, we did have at least one of the delegates dedicated to not voting for budgets with significant increases for CUs. That\u2019s something that plays into this growth vs. trim debate within the community. That\u2019s perhaps one tangible example of what we\u2019re talking about.   Derek 58:00  For Protocol Engineering, a lot of the impetus for the way we created our budget proposal was driven by direct community discussion. And a lot of that happened in Denver, where we had direct one-to-one discussions with delegates and community members, being the topic of late, of course, the workaround L2. That\u2019s driven many conversations and, therefore, also a necessity for what we\u2019re trying to do and the resources needed. I think it\u2019s key to the communication between the community, MKR holders, and the teams that are doing the work in all these cases. It all comes back to those discussions, the Forum, Discord, and ensuring that that discourse happens.   Thomas Flitter 58:55  Seems one of the main issues is aligning needs between the community and the needs of the CUs. I think it\u2019s the communication and the relationship between the delegates and facilitators; that build that relationship. One of the things too is the direction setting and the delegates in providing that constructive feedback. It\u2019s very important as we continue to develop our CU strategic initiatives\u2014 to have that feedback. One of the other things, too, is that part of the issues do come from dealing with misinformation. We\u2019ve gone through several CUs conversations, the tension between folks coming up with misinformation. And that\u2019s been a challenging piece to it. As you submit a budget and get information back; what kind of misinformation have you been dealing with? And what are the challenges you\u2019ve been facing?.   David Utrobin 01:00:35  I think there were two main buckets:   Number one is misinformation about how the protocol as a whole is doing. How do we view the protocol\u2019s status and health as a whole? And I think this was mainly driven over the last month or two by some UI quirks with Maker Burn maybe not accurately representing financial information.  The second bucket is sentiment, facts, and ideas around CUs themselves. One of the things that our team dealt with during this governance cycle was addressing many criticisms around our team. And some of them were just not true like we\u2019re playing or making a lot more money than we are. Pretty simple things, but things that delegates would be told by the people delegating to them or people in the community. And all that is not verified information that gives a loose idea about the CU and the team. The number one thing that helped us deal with that for our team was direct communication with delegates. I appreciated it when two or three different delegates came to me and said, \u201cHey, this is the problem,\u201d and they gave me the chance to defend myself and to give them our viewpoint that aligns everybody closer to the truthful information and the real cause of helping us grow. So, yeah: direct communication with delegates is the key message that I want to share.     Juan 01:03:00  To Thomas: What are you referring to with misinformation? Do you have any particular case that you wanted to address?    Thomas Flitter 01:03:05  With \u201cmisinformation,\u201d we refer to folks not being clear on the objectives for the CU and what the strategy is. I also think it was a question about profitability and ensuring that certain aspects of that CU are communicated correctly. And so that was one of the things we wanted to point out. And I see many people not liking the misinformation.   David Utrobin 01:04:06  I think there\u2019s a difference between saying something is misinformation or something is just a flat-out lie. And I think misinformation as a term has been overused. I think it captures a neutral stance on a person\u2019s motive regarding the information they share; is it a lie? Is it intentional? Unintentional? Has the person who shared the info just been misinformed? MakerMan makes a fantastic point. He\u2019s not a fan of binary thinking concerning the information. Certain kinds of information have statistical relevance, but, in general, information changes, and getting an accurate understanding of the current case of things is also important. Maybe you hear something that might have been the case a month ago, but it\u2019s not the case today. I\u2019m interested and excited to see how direction setting at the DAO evolves because I think one interesting aspect of it is that CU facilitators are the closest people on the ground to their work. So they have the most wisdom and insight concerning their function. I feel there\u2019s a little bit of space between delegates and facilitators in this regard. I feel delegates are tempted to be direction setters. But at the same time, soar facilitators.   Kianga 01:06:45  David, as you mentioned direction setting, I\u2019d love if anyone else on the call would share their views on the role of the delegate.  What is the view today from the community of what do you think delegates should be doing? Setting the direction or doing more listening to kind of try and perceive what the community wants and then provide leadership around that input? And how do we get that input?   Someone spoke about this idea of an executive delegate role in the call we just had before this on the strategic initiative.   Unknown 01:08:08  I can just add a little more context about the mentioned call. With SES, we have started the Strategic Initiative, the DAO Resilience Improvement Initiative. And that one has two big elements. One element is truly about creating a roadmap for the practical execution of tasks and changes that may improve the resilience, whether it be on the financial or operational level of the DAO. But to put the roadmap like that together and make it possible to make also big changes might require more coordination than we\u2019re currently capable of. I think we need to have a clear expression of the vision and the strategy that each delegate would want to pursue. And maybe also see which delegates are closer to each other in their outlook of what Maker DAO should be in the future and which ones are further apart, and what the different dimensions are like: is there a difference in opinion about decentralization? is there a difference in opinion about risk appetite? Is there a difference in opinion about the aggressiveness of growth? There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know yet. We don\u2019t even know if these are the right dimensions. But this is what the DAO Resilience Improvement Initiative also includes. There is a Discord channel on the MakerDAO Official Discord for people interested in that, which is called The Resilient Stakeholder Initiative. Today\u2019s meeting was recorded and made available, and future meetings will also be open attendance. So everyone interested in those aspects is welcome to join. This is a longer-term focus, and we\u2019re trying to get to the bottom of the issues and find how delegates are aligned or not aligned around vision and strategy. We only just kick-started it today. But I hope it can add a lot to the conversation we\u2019re having here. As it goes to direction setting delegates vs. facilitators, if we do assume that delegates have a clearly expressed vision and strategy for MakerDAO (even if there may be competing ones), then I think that\u2019s the level of direction setting that we would typically like to see; it\u2019s very high level, and it does not stay away from micromanagement. In the absence of high-level direction like that, people tend to micromanage instead, which risks removing a lot of the advantages that a decentralized organization should have. And I think that if there is a high-level direction that is set by the delegates, and \u2014as a consequence\u2014 they can stay away from micromanagement and just fund the projects, the CUs, and the budgets that they support through their vision strategy and make it clear why or why not, then there is plenty of room for facilitators to create their projects and manage their CUs with a great degree of freedom, which is needed to keep things going in a DAO because people need to be able to operate fairly independently from one another. They need to be motivated, work the way they like, and not have too many micromanagement rules to worry about.   Eric 01:13:57  I guess one question/observation I have is\u2026 should delegate at times take more initiative around difficult subjects?  At times, there are decisions to be made or not made, and where the community might have split. We\u2019ve generally found that when a complicated issue arises, the delegates want to hear about it but don\u2019t necessarily want to step forward and lead on it. And at the end of the day, how much are we supposed to be leading? In some of these things, we\u2019ll get accused of being tangled. And if we just report to the delegates, should they be taking more initiative on tough issues? Providing leadership and honestly taking some personal risk by taking a position and bringing it out before the community?  Otherwise, it always falls back to the CU, and I wonder how that should work out? Because on the one hand, they want to see you take the initiative, but on the other hand, you got a fair amount of criticism when they see us take too much initiative.   Niklas Kunkel 01:16:00  I wanted to give the counterpoint to what I just heard about delegates stepping up and making decisions vs. \u2014as I heard on the other side\u2014 facilitators that need to take charge and contribute to tough decisions As a facilitator of a particular CU (Oracles), my mandate is just to do Oracles. So, often, when it comes to these decisions within the DAO, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m supposed to be contributing to those decisions. When I do, am I contributing as a community member who would like to see a decision be made in a certain direction, or am I contributing as an Oracle facilitator who technically has no authority on anything outside of Oracles?  I think there\u2019s a little bit of a disagreement; it\u2019s quite unclear. Some people feel that it\u2019s within our remit to contribute to decisions outside of our mandate. In contrast, others are more strict constitutionalists and go, \u201cthis is my mandate, and I shouldn\u2019t be contributing to anything else.\u201d Having a little more clarity around what the expectations are, I think, will help things go a lot more effectively in whatever direction we go.   Nadia Alvarez 01:18:21  I agree with you, Nick. But I also see that sometimes I would love to stick to my mandate and do that, but there are so many things that I see that someone has to do in the DAO, and no one is doing, like the Twitter account. We have so many holes in the DAO that I can\u2019t just sit on my mandate and do nothing else. At the same time, I understand what you said about facilitators not being involved in these decisions. Still, we are doing everything, and we understand what\u2019s happening within the protocol from a different perspective. I don\u2019t know who else is that much exposed as we are to the current situation of the protocol. I hope that, with this new initiative that SES is leading, we can define it because I see that there are so many things to do but then when we arrive at a crossroads. We need to make a decision, some say yes, some say no, and then it is super hard to do something and commit yourself; there is a disconnection.   Niklas Kunkel 01:21:09  I don\u2019t disagree with anything you just said. There\u2019s much stuff to do, and there\u2019s no one responsible for doing it, and so people step up, and they do things that are outside of their mandate, and it benefits the protocol, and the community, but is that a long term, viable process?  I disagree. I think it\u2019s a failure of the DAO not to have committed people and/or teams for those things being medicated by people like Nadia and Sam stepping up and doing things going above and beyond right and doing things outside of their mandate. I guess one of the things that concern me too is\u2026 we\u2019re trying to get more oversight and more accountability in the DAO; more transparency of the CUs, but, ultimately, I\u2019m going to be judged based on how the Oracles CU is performing, and so I\u2019m incentivized to focus on my CU because if I start solving all of these problems that are outside of the CU. Then the CU suffers for it; I\u2019m doing a poor job, right? I think everyone feels differently about this. But I think it will fall back to that type of behavior. So we need to plug these holes that we see and not just expect people like Nadia and Sam and a whole host of other people to do that work. That is not a sustainable way of working. It\u2019s just a stopgap.   MakerMan 01:23:38  I want to echo both what Nadia and Nick are saying. In the loosest sense, who has the authority and responsibility here? Maker holders, right? In this case, delegates fall in the middle of this: if we weren\u2019t here, it would all fall to Maker holders; that\u2019s where you would want to see such a strategic unit form. The way I see it as an organization is this: it has many groups that should be focused on third tasks and their tasks alone; they can look across the spectrum, and they definitely should coordinate, but when it comes to information and doing their job, they do their job, and then they feed information up to somebody or some Unit. Everybody hates this idea of centralization, but the concept is valid, that information must flow up to some group that then makes a strategic decision and then basically allocates resources that then funneled down to everybody that sets the new direction. I liken it to a ship with many rollers: if the Norse were across the ocean and all these guys who were rolling were barking orders, they wouldn\u2019t get anywhere. You needed one guy going, \u201cwe\u2019re going this way, and we\u2019re doing this,\u201d and maybe they argued about it, but in the end, somebody had authority and responsibility to do it. I see that MakerDAO doesn\u2019t have a centralized direction. Delegates could form a strategic unit because we\u2019re the ones with most of the vote, and we can coordinate. CUs can funnel up information and how they\u2019re doing their jobs, and then we set the strategic tone and direction, right? I agree there\u2019s a huge hole that needs to be filled, and from my seat (and I\u2019m not doing this just because I want to be this person or this delegate), I think it\u2019s the delegate\u2019s mandate to form such a strategic unit and coordinate CUs.   Open Discussion  Max Glass 01:26:06  Firstly, that conversation was wonderful. And I think that we could talk about growth vs. trim as it relates to Content Production CU, which is oriented towards increasing growth, and at the same time, I think it would run on an incredibly lean budget or at least lean margins for the for Glass Entertainment. We had a conversation this morning with Mariano, and he was wonderfully helpful. I look forward to working and collaborating with him and getting his guidance. We\u2019re committed to coordinating with him and with Growth CU. I think he described the potential path to this group (Glass Entertainment), getting a development budget so it can put together a cool proposal,  and I think we will collaborate on putting that in front of everybody. I see the comments saying that if we want to onboard new CU, we better figure out what message we want them to project, and that\u2019s part of this three-month development process of us being in the community and communicating with as many parties as we can to figure out the best narratives. And this is all about narratives. It\u2019s all about storytelling. And Glass Entertainment is a storytelling machine. The idea is to leverage this storytelling machine to identify the best narratives for the benefit of MakerDAO and each CU and get those narratives pre-approved. I\u2019d love to see if anybody has any questions for us. I think that the long-term goal is not to be an outside provider. I work in MakerDAO every day related to onboarding real assets, so I\u2019m sort of on the front lines of one part of the growth strategy. I don\u2019t know as much as Nadia about how MakerDAO operates, but I\u2019m trying my best, and I am doing my best to understand the levers. I think that being better at telling our story is one great lever that we can pull, especially with so many growth initiatives coming online with L2 scaling and all of our institutional options. I think instead of being an outside contractor, the idea is to build in a crypto native and MakerDAO native group that\u2019s embedded, that has real long term, long-standing relationships with the CUs, that understands truly how to operate in this political system, and is essentially long term incentivized in the same way the CUs are. The CUs, ultimately, by proving themselves, can earn an MKR vest once they\u2019ve proven that they\u2019re worthy of it. And I think that if you look at the budget proposal for the initial 125,000 development budget, there\u2019s only 10% that\u2019s actual profit for Glass Entertainment Group. 90% of every dollar shows up on the screen, and they are a low-margin business that primarily serves cable television, which is a dying industry. So, I think there\u2019s an opportunity for that company \u2014It\u2019s my mom\u2019s company\u2014 to serve a growing industry instead of a dying one. But they can still operate superlean, in 90% of it showing up on screen and then earning a low production fee.   Nancy Glass 01:30:53  We\u2019re also a huge digital unit and a huge and super successful podcast unit. We\u2019re one of the top 100 companies in the world in production. We don\u2019t think about it 10% profit; we usually make less because we don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve never thought about money in my life; what I think about is: how do you tell a great story? How do you get involved in something that is super cutting-edge? We have been involved in the growth of so many different companies because that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting. Somebody asked us an interesting question: are we trying to be the brand messaging leader or just content production itself? Well, we want to be both. But what we want to do is respond to what you need. When you say, \u201cyou guys are gonna hate working with us because we have different ideas every week, and it will be opposite the last one,\u201d well: welcome to my world! This is what we do. Every day, I have dealt with executives who say, \u201cI want it to be smart, but not intelligent,\u201d and \u201cI want it to be fresh but familiar.\u201d We don\u2019t care what we\u2019re attracted to our brains, innovation, and opportunity. We just launched a brand new fitness app. It\u2019s a new piece of fitness equipment that works with AI and robotics to measure what your body is doing and respond to you instantly. We did it just because it\u2019s fun. We will eventually make money on it, but it was so exciting and fun in such a successful launch. And it\u2019s an international launch. We also understand the international audience.   Max Glass 01:32:49  Just a comment. We don\u2019t want to step on anyone\u2019s toes. We don\u2019t. And I think the advantage of Glass Entertainment it\u2019s listening first. It\u2019s about listening. I\u2019m new. I\u2019ve only been involved in Maker since August. And I\u2019ve made a little bit of an impact so far. I hope. And I think everybody here intends to do more listening, primarily listening and not being pushy or stepping on anyone\u2019s toes. I think Glass Entertainment has been successful for many years, working for some very difficult clients.   Jen 01:33:50  I have a question. I guess where I\u2019m landing is the model, right? Why does this need to be created as a CU when you guys can excel, as you have been successful for so many years? I don\u2019t think anybody is questioning the quality and the potential you guys can bring. You just said you\u2019re going to have to operate in this DAO political landscape. Why would you want to bring on that additional burden to yourself when you could be freely left alone and operating through, whether it\u2019s a brand CU or another CU, to funnel you the pertinent information you need, and then you execute on that?    Max Glass 01:34:48  Well, because I don\u2019t think we want to burden you with that. I don\u2019t think we need to be seeking CU status off the bat. I think it\u2019d be nice to get funding to do this development budget and have a three-month period where we can prove that we can work in the community and don\u2019t have to be a burden on Growth to be a conduit to all of the other CUs. Instead, I can have direct relationships and be savvy enough. The other answer is that the idea here is not to make money from the DAI. It\u2019s not about squeezing dollars out of this thing (because \u2014again\u2014 90% ideally goes on screen). It\u2019s about earning a stake in MakerDAO long-term. And that\u2019s my understanding of CU: they have long-term compensation; they\u2019re aligned to Maker DAO. And we\u2019re not asking for any MKR at this point, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d ask for six or eight months until we\u2019re up and running in production and we\u2019ve built credibility. Does that make sense? Is that reasonable?   Jen 01:36:12  Definitely. And it\u2019s great to hear you want to be long-term in Maker. I see it will be much more difficult right off the bat in this developmental phase for you to source the critical information you\u2019ll need to the on-ramp and get your heads around this world. If you liaised with CU, that could guide you, which will make your lives a lot easier. You can simultaneously participate as a community member; you don\u2019t have to be a paid community member; you can simultaneously buy MKR, should you want to, and get that upside (I\u2019m not recommending that, of course). It feels unnecessary to start as a CU when it could be much more elegant in a hired agency capacity.   Max Glass 01:37:11  I understand. And I think we don\u2019t start on day one as a CU so long as maybe Growth can provide a budget to get the development started. If that\u2019s a possibility (I think Mariano had said that was a possibility), we could be incubated inside Growth. However, part of my job every day is helping outside institutions understand how to interact with MakerDAO. And I can provide that service to Glass Entertainment. I\u2019ve got a good relationship with the company. I can provide that guidance. Hopefully, you and Mariano will be okay providing guidance. Initially, we just want enough development budget to get this going.   Nadia Alvarez 01:38:04  I don\u2019t think it is because of your proposal; I think we, as a DAO, do not know when someone should be a CU or a service provider. That is a question that will happen currently, and we have no idea that. It is not just because of your specific proposal, but it is in general, we do not know. If companies like yours become CUs, we will have 500 or 1000 CUs. I do not know what should be the path that we should take. And I think the community does not know either. There is much debate around that.   David Utrobin 01:39:07  I think one thing to consider is the tools that potential contributors have at their disposal, so you do not have to go for CU status. You can, as you mentioned, approach a CU like Growth or SES to see if they have a budget to help incubate you or give you some sort of chance. I want to point you guys to the SPF tool in the MIPS. SPF stands for Special Purpose Fun. It can be used to propose a limited engagement or project, and it sounds like that might be perfect for Glass Entertainment.   Max Glass 01:39:47  That is great. I have never heard of the SPF. So thank you so much, David, for suggesting that. I think that my goal here is to get to the point where there is a development budget as fast as possible so that Glass Entertainment can show you what they are capable of. I have my credibility on the line here if they fail. I hope to have a long-standing, good standing with this community, and they have their reputation. And reputation is essential \u2014over the long term\u2014 what matters most. So I do not think they\u2019re going to fall on their face or let anyone down with a 125,000 development budget to put together an amazing proposal.

My name is Payton; I go by Prose11 online. I am one of the Governance facilitators. This is our weekly sync where we go over things relating to the Governance and Risk aspects of the protocol. As usual, we got a bit of an agenda to get through. This meeting is being recorded. We encourage open participation. If you have a question and want to hop on the mic, it is helpful to raise your hand. You can also drop it in the comment section; happy to read it out for you if you cannot hop on. If there is a lull in the conversation or you have a question feel free to jump in. Today we will start with our two minutes Roundup. I will get into the vote updates, starting with the polls.

Moreover, as the internal coordinates, MakerDAO calls it CMON. This initiative is quite large. The collateral leads us to think about it as just onboarding and offboarding, but a holistic view of collateral also includes the maintenance and everything that goes on top of the three foundational functions.   2802\u00d71374 159 KB   This includes priority-setting processes and workflow coordination between the many different CU involved in this initiative. I have listed the main ones here: Collateral Engineering Services, Protocol Engineering, Sidestream, Auction Services, Oracle\u2019s Risk Growth, my team GovComms, and Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling. Today, I will give you a brief update on this initiative. First, I will give you the products in implementation. I will talk about what we have achieved in terms of collaterals, D3Ms, PSMs, institutional wallets, what is in progress, and the upcoming. Following, I will go into the actual initiative milestones from a very high level.   2628\u00d71558 137 KB   For the first section, we will go through all the different implementations we have been keeping an eye on and tracking for the last couple of months. For one, we have achieved the milestone of onboarding the curve LP token for SD staked Eth over Eth. I believe we recently got that up at the beginning of this month. The next collaterals under consideration are wstETH-C, PAXG, GNO, rETH, and sETH2. At the moment, the groups involved in priority and priority setting are determining what should be next. There are some more exciting updates because the groups just published recommended metrics for collateral onboarding to help guide these decisions and an updated collateral status Index Sheet.   2468\u00d71364 126 KB   As for D3M implementations, the quick update is that, in general, there is a large code rewrite happening to make onboarding D3M\u2019s from various platforms easier, more streamlined, and efficient. In parallel, the compound D3M goes through an internal or an external code review before it is formally launched. As for institutional vaults, we have had a long-running initiative to partner with Nexo on their big institutional vault, which is still in progress. It has been a bit slow going back and forth them making progress on this. Nadia and the team from growth are looking for other potential clients to work out institutional vault all deals.  Nadia Alvarez: It has been taking a long time because institutional vaults are like a product on their own, and many risks are associated with these vaults because they are so large. We have been developing the product for the last month. It is important to audit the code that Nexo is using to automate the protection of the vault because we do not want that vault to be liquidated. We need to understand that everything is correct. Nexo or any other institution will need an interface to access this vault. We have been talking with Oasis, who also is building this interface. It is a complex product for within data. After we launch it, it will be easy to onboard new institutions. We are reaching out to all of these institutions with this product; it is attractive.    16:32  David Utrobin: Thanks for providing context; the first one is always the hardest, but things get easier after that. That is it for our products and implementation section; we will polish that for next time. In general, this is the comprehensive milestone list for the initiative. I have grouped milestones into four main categories because we have 10.   2404\u00d71422 230 KB  Process upgrades, technological upgrades, housekeeping, and products developed within collateral management.  Today, I will talk briefly about the categories one at a time to condense the ten milestones into four significant updates. This has been the highest priority milestone within the initiative since we started regarding process upgrades. Robert has spearheaded milestones one and four to revise the collateral onboarding process. This includes different things: it is an update of the collateral application process. It is the onboarding of CES as a domain team and publishing a new collateral status index. It is also determining the prioritization criteria for collateral. It updates the actual process documentation itself, and finally, it creates a process for parallel work alignments between all the different teams involved from step one to launch.  Robert: There is much work currently in progress; we just completed our Q1 review. In the meeting prior to this, we will post the video and give you more detail about what we did in Q1 and what we are planning on doing in Q2. The key to ensuring we have a process that works for our community, that onboards collateral, and we can do this in a safe, secure, and cost-effective manner. Today is part of that process to do the outreach into the community and collect feedback to make sure that we hear what the community is experiencing. We take that in and incorporate it into the following steps related to collateral offboarding. This is part of our collateral maintenance; we have onboarding and collateral maintenance in the collateral management lifecycle. There are two distinct phases and steps to get the collateral into the system. And then we have to manage it. I am excited because we hired an individual as a program manager to take over all the processes we are managing. She has experience in program management and bringing people together. So, during the quarter, we will start to work more fully on the clutter offboarding because it is a pretty significant area of work, and there is a lot of feedback and opinions on how we might go about doing this. We will also build on the MIPS that has currently been published today to build on collateral offboarding.    20:10  David Utrobin: Another key thing with these two milestones is trying to depersonalize the reasons for prioritizing one thing over another and offboarding something. Often, I hear in the community that CU tends to be seen as the gatekeepers for collateral, and in many ways, that is true. However, in other ways, this process revision aims to standardize and objectify those recommended metrics so that it is less about the subjective opinions of CUs and more about objective guidance that can bring everybody to the same answers, regardless of personal opinion.   2118\u00d71186 210 KB  For MS2: liquidations infrastructure cleanup, the main goal was to hand off all of the touchpoints for liquidations to the new sidestream auction services Core Unit. We want to completely transition from the old auction UIs into the new UIs that SES has developed and transition to the new auction demo keeper that SES has been working on. All these things are in progress. I believe auctions.makerdao.network is where the SES UI is, and it is very close to being ready to be switched over for the main MakerDAO UI. - Someone: I can add just a little more color to that: they are piggybacking off the code they have made for the UI to make an actual standalone keeper in the same way we have the option demo keeper. From the protocol engineering units perspective, that is a huge help because we have been maintaining a keeper that is a little bit outside of our core discipline, and it is going to be nice when we can hand that off, and that is not part of the collateral onboarding process for our team as well.  David Utrobin: For MS10, we have the delivery of a DM3 and rewrite.  Chris: There are many ways of providing credit or Dai into other protocols. We have Aave D3M, and it became clear that other potential protocols compound the refusals; different protocols could benefit from the same thing. We went with much breath in order to figure out what the requirements would be for each one of these and do a bit of a rewrite. Once we are finished, it will be easy to hand this off to collateral engineering to deploy these bespoke D3Ms if governance wishes.   David Utrobin: Lastly, MS7, the lowest priority of everything I have mentioned so far, is PSM improvements. This one is slated to be a focus more on Q3. Those are the three main technological upgrades in the queue. As for housekeeping, there are only a couple of milestones here. One is the stable coin vault cleanup, which is thoroughly in progress. TUSD is being offboarded, but what is left is USDC, USDP, and there is one more. In the traditional sense, there are three different stablecoin vaults, like USDC-A type vaults rather than PSM. The idea is to offload the remaining vaults and have all of our stablecoin exposure at MakerDAO managed through PSMs. The next step for MS6 is to offload the other three stablecoin Vault types in a bundle, which would essentially liquidate them into the PSM.  26:18  Chris: The high level is T-USD, which will be a sort of typical liquidation turned on a rate-limited liquidation through a normal liquidation mechanism to recapitalize Dai. The other stablecoins, like USDC, PAX, and G-USD, have Vault types and PSM components. We will take this contract that will allow us to effectively liquidate the underwater vaults directly into the respective PSMs. That way, it is not so much like reclaiming Dai; it is shifting Dai over to the PSM available in the PSM.  David Utrobin: For housekeeping, we want to respond to all the greenlit MIP six applications. This is just the part of increasing the stakeholder experience for people who want to come in and partner with MakerDAO; whether they end up bringing a deal to fruition or not, we find it to be important to respond and have a high standard for how we communicate with people applying at MakerDAO.   Robert: We plan to start posting onto the existing MIPS 6 that are greenlit - this does not change the status. It allows them to look at the proposed collateral application template, which is currently in a formal submission. They can look at those questions that clarify the guidelines published today take, and then update their MIPS sixes to include the additional information and signal to us if they still are interested in moving forward in the process. Also, for those uninterested, simply let us know so we can remove them from the list. We believe this will help us understand who is interested in moving forward and not doing the first round of cleanup on the collateral status index. I have posted the draft index that we are starting to use. We use it in our collateral alignment meetings, both the on-chain and off-chain, this week. It seemed to work well to quickly move through where collateral was at, how we are working through that, and the next steps. Then it is clear that there are some issues: Greenlit collateral sitting there for an extended period. Hopefully, that is helpful for the community to understand what some of the following steps are.  29:34  David Utrobin: Finally, the last bucket: our products. We have three milestones relating to products. One was to onboard the curve stETH/ETH LP token, which is delivered. The only thing left with this milestone is to do the debt ceiling expansion. I believe that there is a small expansion plan for this next executive vote from 3 million to 5 million, but then following a proposed parameter foreign post by Risk proposed 50 million. This milestone will be considered complete once the debt ceiling is expanded. Milestone five is to onboard the compound D3M. This is happening in parallel and is blocked by the D3M rewrite. It might be that it is already Code Completed. It is just going through reviews.  Derek: We are doing an internal team review now. We are hoping to get it in for the next audit window. This is the modular discussion that Chris mentioned earlier, so we are making sure that it is extensible and scalable. That is driving some discussion around how we build the internal Maker piece and then the external bit to help all the integration.     Discussion  Collateral Management  Robert 34:31  Since the MCD launch, which is the multi collateral Dai launch at the end of 2019, I do not think any of us would have anticipated the growth we have had with the protocol. To support this growth, our collateral and onboarding have tried to keep up with the quick pace of our industry. We went from onboarding ETH and BAT at the launch to onboarding just about ERC20 collateral we could find; we exhausted those tokens. We offboarded some and created the wrap BTC market. We experimented with other strategies like LP tokens, adding PSMs and institutional vaults, and now D3Ms, RWAs, L2, and some hybrid solutions that are starting to pop up. Some of the processes we have today were not built to handle the evolution of our collateral over the past two and a half years. I want to use our RWA as an example. What it looked like to onboard in our RWA was completely unknown. Back then, members of the community like Long Charles, Rune, Planet X, and others wrote the initial MIPS and processes to define collateral onboarding. I am sure they were not thinking about our RWAs, let alone these hybrids that are slightly off-chain and on-chain technology, business, legal, and deal making. History is important, and it is also easy to forget. It is helpful to remember as we shape our future.   2694\u00d71286 218 KB  36:18  Today, we have a collateral onboarding process. Yes, it is real, and we use it to our best ability. We are referred to are the on-chain collateral stakeholders, the off-chain collateral stakeholders, and the mandated actors. To be clear, this list includes protocol engineering, Oracles, Risk, Real-world Finance, Growth, CES, SES, GovComms, GovAlpha, and the incubation CUs LTS which is legal, and Love, which is Luca and the Oversight Committee. The process was created by the MakerDAO community members shortly before the Maker Foundation was dissolved. I mentioned a few of them just a moment ago. We all realize the process is not perfect, but there is a process with prioritization, and we have a baseline. From my perspective, our growth opportunities are in the transparency, communication, prioritization, and commitment areas. The current process may or may not look like this graphic when we are complete with the next iteration, but I just want everyone to know that CES is committed to finding a solution that works, whatever that might look like, to scale the supply of Dai safely and securely in the most cost-effective manner possible. As it relates to our current challenges, my assessment of the feedback that I have received is around what I am calling the Big Four, transparency, communication, prioritization, and commitment. I believe these areas represent a critical component of the evolution of our current collateral processes. During our CES Q1 update today, we went into more detail about our plans for Q2; the video will be posted shortly. I recommend a listen when you get a chance. I do not want to spend time telling you what I think. I want to ask you what you are experiencing, so we can make this process better. I am also again participating in this discussion because I, too, have a lot of unanswered questions. Well, we have done a lot of work between the CUs, and work remains to ensure all key stakeholders are aligned. When there is an issue identified, and there is already a defined process, my first step is to take a big step back, collect information, and then move forward again; that is what I hope to do on this call. Feedback is a critical component of surfacing a solution that will bring alignment as it relates to our collateral onboarding. To start this conversation, I will share one of the most prominent challenges CES face regarding collateral onboarding or collateral process. How do we effectively prioritize collateral in the context of our DAO priorities? If you look at some of the conversations, initiatives, and implicit agreements that we have in our community, it is clear that we want to reduce the dependencies on USDC in the PSM. There are a lot of ways to go about that. I think that is a worthwhile goal or objective. We also have what we are saying RWAs or real-world assets are a priority. Well, which ones? Clean money ones? Arranger ones? There is another side to this: we have collateral technology critical to enabling the onboarding of collateral. When we see technology like D3M, there is a possible solution to help us assist in the generation of Dai. This is great. It is challenging for me to understand the priority based on our DAO objectives; I am happy to align on whatever this might be because it makes my job a lot easier. I would also realize it is common to have multiple priorities and focuses; that is the usual way of things working. My goal is to ensure the CES CU deliverables match the community\u2019s expectations. Back to my question, I just posted out to the community ideas on how we effectively prioritize collateral in our DAO priorities. That is all I have; I want to leave it there and allow the discussion to continue. I would love other people to ask other questions that continue this discussion.  41:12  David Utrobin: Could you touch on the difference in the time it takes for on-chain collateral to go from application to implementation versus real-world asset or off-chain collateral?  Robert: Generally speaking, for an on-chain piece of unchained collateral, the process works from when the MIP6 application hits two weeks in RFC, then two weeks in the Greenlit poll. Once it comes out of there, we enter into a prioritization process. Currently, the old status of the collateral status index being used in the forums does have a tab of a prioritization model that we have been using to help us guide the decisions we make on pulling collateral in. The front end of this process is four-plus weeks. The quickest you can get through is four weeks; the back end of that process, the way it is defined and the way the documentation reads, is about four weeks. Some things can move faster. For example, once we have onboarded a piece of collateral, like stake ETH, and the discussions to do different vault types. We can easily move that through much quicker than an eight-week process. But if it is known near c20, we have done work with it before, and we have the tech already available to us, we can rapidly move this through the system. On the real-world finance side of things, our challenge becomes in the deal and the legal aspects and knowing exactly what we have. It seems like from a tech perspective, all roads lead to the MIP21. MIP21 essentially means that all areas in the way of liquidations are pricing. If there is any aspect of that, or if there is a token, most of these deals do not have that, so it is a dummy token and emergency shutdown. All of that has to be defined in a legal agreement that is off-chain, and the amount of time that can take is entirely up to the deal\u2019s complexity. We might see incompleteness in the application or in the terms that are being defined if anyone from the real-world finance team wants to pipe in. However, that can greatly expand the deal. If you look at the new collateral status index, I have a T plus column, which means the time plus the application. You will see that the current real-world assets that have been onboarded or Greenlit are significantly more time than the on-chain ones. It is different, and we need to know that it is different. We are trying to put together the processes that recognize the differences to move that through the system.    45:39  LongForWisdom: I want to comment on Robert\u2019s point about not having good privatization tools currently available. A key part of this process is transparency and communication between Governance and Core Units. Thus far, all our voting processes have been used to prioritize topics in a vacuum without comparing them to other things we might want to do. Although better than nothing, it\u2019s not workable in the long term for obvious reasons. The general hope is to provide a voting primitive that better handles relative privatizations. GovAlpha and DUX will be working on this. If everything goes well in this quarter, I hope to be able to try something in the next few months. We potentially should have prioritized this earlier, in addition to other stuff. The lack of that contributes to the confusion and tension around collateral onboarding and our general implementations.  Prose11: I want to follow up on that statement; it is not easy to communicate cross core units because different Core Units have different priorities. We have all budgeted for other objectives for different initiatives. When the DAO comes along and votes for something new, a lot of coordination effort needs to occur. We have come a long way with setting up across core unit initiatives. However, working things into a true priority framework that prioritizes governance input while still preserving Core Unit autonomy is a tough nut to crack. We are open to collaborators and further ideas on that. I expect the forum posts from the US on the subject tomorrow to get things started. There are still a lot of difficult questions to answer.    48:29  Wouter: I wanted to quickly try to connect the dots with the MIP65 posted and the reaction against it. It is essential to see that these are connected. The prioritization discussion is an old discussion. Since the beginning, there have been a lot of concerns that the prioritization is not transparent. Outsiders have been concerned that CUs have too much discretion in deciding which collateral types get prioritized. For insiders, it is a very different situation. We know there have been coordination processes in place. The discussions about prioritization have always been intended to be as objective as possible. But due to the even perceived lack of transparency, there is difficulty convincing outsiders that this is the case. In that sense, the CUs may be making their lives unnecessarily difficult. Although it is not easy to make it entirely objective and transparent, MIP65 is somewhat of a rift in the community. MKR holders and delegates asking for more information are pitted against the Core Units. I do not know whether this passes or not is super relevant. But if it passes, I see it as a crude way of prioritizing. If it passes, I hope it is a motivation point to ensure a transparent and open prioritization process. Once we have that process in place, it is hopefully no longer necessary for people to post a MIP like MIP65. While many people have commented on the thread, it is a step back. It might be good if we can see this as an opportunity and an extra motivation to get to this transparent and well-defined privatization process.  51:50  Justin: I was one of the first delegates to voice my opinion on the MIP65 and was taken back by the responses\u2019 forcefulness. We need to be careful about allowing organizations inside the MIPs themselves because it can easily lead to an arms race, which we have already seen examples of. I am not happy about that part of that. I do not think it behooves us to do detailed privatizations for the Core Unit because it will lead to overwhelming governance. We will have to create these nitty-gritty details on the DAO level. However, we do need a level of strategic prioritization on the level of the DAO. Then, the MKR holders feel they have a say in the prioritization process and the details of the Core Units. Once you get into the weeds of the details, it reveals things you did not necessarily know once you started this process. This makes a difference on what types of collateral it makes sense to onboard. As we have said before, the bigger issues ask if we should focus on the RVAs of the clean money initiatives. These kinds of strategic privatizations should probably be at the DAO level.  Prose11: Thanks for sharing your perspective there. LongForWisedom: That is close to what we aim for in our production. We need methods for MKR holders to communicate those priorities.    54:10  Wouter: Regarding prioritization, I put in the concept of budgets and expanding budgets in my delegation. You want to do prioritization periodically. During a meeting, everybody comes to grips with what should be prioritized, what will be done, and then you go off and do the work. Then, you come back and do it again. Let us get pasted this idea of reprioritizing every month. We will be lucky to do it every quarter or semiannually. We need to think about timeframes, processes, and how to prioritize. We also need to consider the point of view from outside parties. If I am a party that put half a million into legal fees and getting an RWA, I would want a quick answer to: 1.)   Should I even make that investment? 2.)   If I did invest, will I get in? There is a genuine issue of a mismatch between outside parties and how we can do process and timeframes. I see these as real issues. We can do them, but I think we need to do them organizationally and across the board.  55:39  David Utrobin: I am against hard prioritization rules within MIPs. People external to the prioritization process should not have strong guidelines to block people from doing other work. There are objective shared metrics with any collateral that we can compare. When you are dealing with the collateral, there are nuances to each. You are mandated to work on this collateral to exclude everything else. There is also some problem part of that process that requires, let us say, eight different back and forths with the collateral applicant and the engineering teams. Why should that block other collateral that might be on the wayside? Let us give core units the proper amount of autonomy to make these decisions because they are more involved with seeing those nuances. As Long said, I find it crude to include these things in MIPs.  Prose11: To present the other side that we have heard on the forums: collateral applicants claim that it is challenging for them to engage with the process. In reward lending, you can sign a letter of intent. If everything checks out, the deal is good. Whereas with the DAO, it can go back on its word anytime. It is much harder to anticipate when deals might be finalized. There is also always the unfortunate deal-breaker that MKR holders could vote down the proposal at the last moment. The feedback we received states that prioritization is included in some proposals because it allows teams to ensure that spending money on legal structure will be fruitful. This will play into our process as we scale, regardless of if we choose to accept prioritization frameworks self-contained within MIPS.    59:01  Prose11: Do we have more to say about the current management, either cycle or general ongoings in the forum?  Unknownspeaker: If we include prioritization in the MIPs themselves, it would have a chilling effect on the future. The organization\u2019s goal is to increase the throughput of our ruled assets that we are getting in as collateral. We start letting MIP prioritization happen in this way. Future RWA\u2019s will look at that and say, \u201cwell, I am sixth in line with the current priority prioritization. I am not even going to attempt this until we get through some of this\u201d. We will see fewer RWA collaterals get proposed. We may be less willing to take on smaller RWA\u2019s if they take this prioritization approach. We do not want to block some future unknown RWA that might come through and must be deprioritized because we passed a ten-million-dollar trial run with priority. There may be other collateral prioritization costs beyond the Core Unit perspective.    1:00:35  Eric: I came from the real world regarding RWA and worked in finance for too long. I want to speak on what we are doing and what we do not know how to do. In the real world, you would work with a potential borrower. You agree on a reasonable set, not all the terms, but high-level terms. You would sign a term sheet on both sides. It is not legally binding, but we always sign it because your reputation matters. The idea is further diligence confirms what the borrower told you; you will do a deal with those terms. We have a bunch of challenges. Borrowers will come to us with a proposal. They will want an 80% advance rate with a 2% stability fee. The market would give them a 65% advance and a 5% stability fee in the real world. So, their request is markedly worse to Maker than they could ever get in the real world. We are not there to negotiate. But then what do we do? There are stages of when this will happen, but we are getting a lot of proposals that are arguably very unfair to Maker in real-world market terms. If Maker subsidizes someone, they want to know how much they are subsidizing them. Since we are not negotiating, how does this ever get dealt with? Do we post in the community and say they want 80 loan-to-value? The real world is supporting 60, and here is my evidence. Token holders, do you want to vote on this? Part of the next-level challenge is not just about the debt ceiling. Christian may speak to this if he is here. Before you get a deal done, there will be dozens of points that matter. We can have them all posted and negotiated on the forum by the Maker token holders, but it will be boatloads of votes and things to think about. Let me be honest about part of the challenge in the real world. Maker could get all 20 terms at once with a smart borrower. But if the smart borrower receives the following 150 terms, you could never get your money back, and they would not violate the agreement. There are many ways to hollow things out and unfair things to Maker. When people are asking unfair things to Maker, at least in our professional judgment, how does the community want to handle this?  1:03:17  Wouter: Eric is bringing up good points. However, there are two different discussions. Prioritization does not necessarily mean that the deal must be accepted. That is another discussion and another challenge. How are Core Units supposed even to know what is acceptable and not acceptable according to Maker governance? It is a big one and should be discussed separately. The other thing I wanted to bring up is that sometimes the assumption is made that there is one way of doing things correctly. If Core Units are following the right way, then it is a matter of showing that to MKR holders, and then everyone will be happy. But of course, the complicated reality is that MKR holders and delegates do not necessarily agree on what is the right way. That is the specific issue with collateral onboarding. People bought up this point before. Your belief in the right priority depends on which vision strategy you want to follow for the DAO. This puts the Core Unit in a challenging position to make their own decisions regarding prioritization because they are following different rules. It does not matter how diligently and objectively you stick to the rule. There will always be MKR holders and delegates who are upset that you prioritize one way or another. Due to that situation, transparency is the only way for Core Units to defend their work. You may disagree with a CUs prioritization method, but that is a different discussion. At the very least, we can show that we follow a consistent and objective set of rules. We do not take or pick favorites. I think it is essential to separate these discussions. It is very different from having someone unhappy with the prioritization order followed. Having Core Units following objectively defined rules and someway agreed upon is better than having CUs work in a less transparent manner built on the blind trust of professionals to make the right decisions. Of course, some degree of trust is needed. Sometimes, there are genuine disagreements on which approach should be taken. In those cases, transparency is your best defense because you can show that you follow an objective set of rules and not pick favorites. That is very important. That is very important.  1:06:57  Kianga: I would like to hear from the Core Units: how much time they are spending on defense. I appreciate that we need transparency and communication. However, I am concerned about the energy, focus, and capacity to execute the vision with the offensive leaning in. We are like sitting ducks to being flooded with proposals and questions. Then, you all must respond, communicate, and defend. At what point are you feeling sabotaged by that dilemma? How do we find that balance of expectations around communication? I love to see you all be able to spend time getting your goals accomplished that does not change in terms of prioritization every week or month. Are we going to keep going like this?  Eric: I hope Christian is here to give you his input. However, we spend a lot of time on stuff that is arguably way off-market in what the folks are asking for. We need to be more proactively transparent. We have tried not to share the dirty laundry and say, \u201cwe think you are not qualified for these 15 reasons\u201d. You do not want to slam people in public. We need to share more politely. Then the community wants to do it; they should do it. However, this is why we think it is not a good idea. As everyone knows, we spent much time around a few big-name transactions. When you tell them, \u201cwe are off-market, and we think these six items are very problematic,\u201d they end up being political and finding many ways to make it happen. We need to rush to give our top six reasons. They disagree with us, so Maker and token holders, what do you want to do? Luca: I can add to what Eric has said. We need to acknowledge that while the parties that want to do business with Maker may have the best possible face, they do not have their incentives aligned. They have business interests that do not necessarily align with the DAO. Instead, we should assume that the Core Units are working as servants of the DAO. This is a preamble to say that we would expect adverse selection on the communication intensity. Those with the lowest quality proposals will be the most vocal on forums. So, we need to trust the Core Unit to handle it. Otherwise, as Eric said, it will be biased toward those whose proposals most distance from market standards. These will be enhanced and hijack most of the attention. As Wouter mentioned, this will ultimately be a matter of trust in the Core Units. Eric: That is a good point: the lender is never really aligned with his borrower because every dollar of interest he must pay us is $1 out of his pocket. You can try to make it more aligned, but there is a zero-sum going game. You are not making friends as a lender. You want to be fair and respectful, but you are not out there to make friends.    1:11:00  Prose11: Thanks for the good input. I see a lot of comments in chat about proactive transparency. The facilitator must be the touchpoint for the Core Units with the DAO structurally. While you as a facilitator might be spending a lot of time on transparency and discussion, you could have a team working on your objectives. While reviewing the questions, the Core Unit\u2019s facilitators handle and structure what within their teams.  1:11:43  Juan: I wanted to hammer down on the voters\u2019 point. We spent a lot of time on defensive communication. Maybe it is true that the loudest people are the worst. We need to do as a Core Unit to focus on transparency. Otherwise, the MKR holders do not see progress or how things are moving forward. We do need to make sure that this happens. This might not be the best. There are many things that I will address, but eventually, the community will say it does not see the priorities. Please do something about this because this needs to be fixed.  1:12:42  Prose11: Awesome. We are getting towards the end of our typical time length here. Are there other last comments or questions we would like to submit before wrapping up today?  1:13:15  Eric: We need a better process with a lot more transparency. However, we need a process that works for potential borrowers as well. Maker\u2019s in the market wants good borrowers to come to us when we are out there. They must think there is a fair, reasonable process to work with. At this point, it feels like we have got a two-legged horse pulling a one-wheeled cart. It is very hard. I am not stating what the right process is. But when we are trying to do business with quality counterparties in the real world, it needs a reliable and consistent professional standard. If it gets robbed every two months with a new process, it will not get good borrowers. People do not want to put up with our drama. Frankly, I would not be a borrower.  ElPro: Eric, pushing back on that, though, we went from an arranger model; to a proposal of looking at an arranger model, which has been forgotten. This is Frank from 3F Delegate. I was super excited about a ranger model. A few MIP6 RWA applicants lobbied me. I told them to be patient and wait for the arranger model. Suddenly, it disappeared. From someone who has been here for quite a long time (it feels like forever), it has been quite frustrating waiting for our RWAs to come to fruition. You mentioned that 80% LTV is probably impossible in the real world. But then, what is the advantage of the product-market fit of Dai and MakerDAO if we cannot give borrowers 80% at competing for stability fee rates versus interest rates in the real world? Why should they come to us if we do not give them maybe 75% to 90%? There are defaults in the world. You know this, Eric. It is going to happen; Maker is going to take a default. We need to stop sugarcoating it. I get that RWF, the legal team, and everyone wants to protect the DAO. However, there comes the point where we need to accept that defaults down the road are to be expected. Where do we draw the line and say MakerDAO is the place to come on board instead of JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs? Eric: I like the arranger model. I hope it comes through, but it has never been voted. I have never seen a serious proposal to do it. And it is not entirely clear what it is. I think it\u2019s a cool idea, but it has never been voted or flushed out.    1:16:30  Luca: We have been discussing the arranger model for a long time. There is a bit of misconception. In finance, everybody is an arranger. Unless you meet the specific borrower, a bank and asset management is an arranger. Everybody is an intermediary. I led the input of the arranger model that we tried to incorporate in the so-called sandbox RWA work. Instead of working with many borrowers, we wanted to work with a few large, relevant counterparties. That could have been a great channel for us to do at scale. We still want to do that. That is why HVB is a bank and is a great potential arranger. Asset managers are great potential arrangers. Other startups like Monetarists also hold great potential. The arranger model does not mean endorsing a black box with hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to people that might have limited experience in deploying money. It is creating a gatekeeper, which is a bit different. Your second point is that no one wants to be in a business with zero default. Eric wrote a methodology that says we want to do investment grade. This has a certain level of default, which is prudent. If we deploy hundreds of millions, we want to do this with big people incentivized alongside us to do good quality work. So, we get hit. They also get hit. If not, we work with counterparties without skin in the game that will beef up risk because they will not get hit. Only we will get hit. We want to avoid this. We have been doing this for the past few months. We are going back to Wouter\u2019s point with RWF. As incubated lending oversight, I am one step remote. However, I can see what RWF does daily. If RWF spends 90% of its work defending why it is not working, this will increase the work time needed by ten times. It is that simple. Myself included, we need to give these gives some level of trust in finalizing the deals. Otherwise, we will go backward. We discuss a proposal that is not market standard. We convince the delegates and community. Good. Then, two weeks later, there is the same proposal with another spin. We discuss it, and we move on. Two weeks after that, there was the same proposal with another spin. It is like a Catch 22. We need to stop this cycle. Otherwise, we work with only 10% of the effective time. This ultimately goes back to trusting the transparency. From here on out, we hope to work on that. I know that RWF has a lot to improve. We are all working as a CU to do that.  1:19:42  Eric: I have a response to one of Frank\u2019s points. I mentioned 60-80 LTV as an example; it is not specific. But let me try to paint the point. Maker should make off-market deals. However, it should also understand how off-market it is. Let us say a deal where the real world does a 70 LTV, and Maker wants to do 80 LTV. With the same interest rate, that is fine. Do it. However, if you had to sell our loan the next day, they would probably pay 85 or 90 cents on the dollar once we did it to another sophisticated investor. So, for a $100 million loan, we give that borrower $10 to $15 million out of our pocket in subsidy. I have nothing against that but know you are explicitly subsiding that borrower in their activities versus what the real world would fund it. It becomes an important question: Whom do you want to subsidize, and how much?  Prose11: Thanks for that perspective. Are there any other thoughts or comments before we wrap up?    1:20:59  Kianga: To Frank\u2019s and Eric\u2019s point, we want to do something off-market (this might not be the appropriate term if we are talking about the real world, this Web3 or DeFi); we should know we are doing it for a reason. To your point, Frank, why would people come to Maker unless we give them better terms? It should be aligned with our strategic vision or that counterparties can help us achieve an obvious and tangible goal. That is a decision nice to make in strategic terms. For example, we would do something off-market relative to the real world rather than on a case-by-case basis. This would help educate the community to know what the difference is. So, if a proposal comes in that is nice in terms of its concepts, it\u2019s about presenting why people may like it. The community does understand what we may be giving up or just what those differences are. We are voting in an informed way and in a strategic way.

My name is Payton, I go by Prose11 online, and I am one of the Governance facilitators here at MakerDAO. Thank you, everyone, for joining us both live and later in the recording for our #187 Governance & Risk call. Today is the 21st of April 2022. A group of awesome people who contribute and are otherwise interested in the Maker protocol is joining me presently. We have a bit of an agenda to get through today. Before we get there, let me remind you that we are recording this meeting. Try not to talk over one another. If you want to add to the conversation, you can use Zoom\u2019s raise hand feature, and I will call you when appropriate. Nevertheless, we want this to be an open conversation: if you have a question, if someone touches on a topic you would like to explore further, do not be afraid to speak up in the chat or hop in the conversation.

He led a workshop at the Global Governance Gathering in Amsterdam. We are thrilled to have him talk about what he did and its outcomes. I will let him present it himself. Deniz: Thank you for the introduction, Payton. I should start by saying I was not on my own. Tiago was on the team\u2013he is our Designer\u2013, and he happens to be a Design Thinking veteran. We used to work together before Maker. It was nice to be in person with him, jamming together on a workshop again. Context: As DUX, we are now focused on governance tooling, trying to build a relevant roadmap and deliver upon it.  As you work on governance tooling, it is inevitable to conclude that DAO governance is a very intertwined domain. There are not many things you can achieve as a single core unit by just iterating on a web app. You need to coordinate with other core units and look at processes, policies, and incentives. Following that train of thought, it makes sense to start thinking about governance and evaluating it in relation to how other projects are doing it. As a core unit, we have been slowly finding our cadence over the past couple of months. At this point, we are running very smoothly. We have plenty of head-space to do research, think, and talk to others. Back in Lisbon, there was an event organized by The DAOist\u2013an organization that does high-quality events and online gatherings\u2013to talk and think about DAO governance frameworks and their processes. It was great. Then we learned that we were doing an event in Amsterdam called The Global Governance Gathering.  That was our cue to decide to do something this time; it was a huge opportunity. Tiago and I are from Amsterdam; we are local\u2013right now, we are at the conference\u2013. We put in a little sponsorship for The DAOist event\u2013big shoutout to the Growth core unit for helping us with that\u2013, organized a workshop, and invited other prominent DAO and governance thinkers from different projects. We spent the day figuring out the main challenges of DAO governance, and we tried to reach a solution or concepts that might be interesting to pursue.     I will now run you through the presentation that I did at the DevConnect conference on Tuesday, summarizing the workshop itself. The recording is also available. After this, we can discuss some of these governance challenges\u2013that we might also be facing at Maker-- and the avenues we could explore to find solutions to said challenges.  18:47  DevConnect Conference - Maker Governance Portal Redesign960\u00d7540 212 KB   We did a redesign of the Governance Portal that will be launching in a couple of days on Tuesday. Here is a teaser of what it is going to look like. We are eager to get that out there; we have been working on this for a long time. We think you are all going to like it.   DevConnect Conference - DAO Governance960\u00d7540 90.9 KB   The core thought of the workshop we organized is that improving DAO governance systems is complex since those are deep-rooted within the rest of a project.  For example, a large part of a governance system resides on-chain, which is hard to change\u2013especially when you are a DeFi protocol that manages a couple of billion worth of value\u2013. Still, there are also the processes the community uses daily. It is very complicated to disturb existing data structures once they are running.  Despite its difficulties, there is enormous potential for improving DAO governance. You only need to pay attention to other layers of the stack.   At DUX, we firmly believe there is plenty of low-hanging fruit on the UX level. We need to figure out the right UX for the interface people use to interact with these governance systems and the level of processes, policies, and more malleable incentives than smart contracts.    20:30  DevConnect Conference - Logo960\u00d7540 542 KB   This is the name of the session we organized with the DAO Governance Design Jam.   DevConnect Conference - Group960\u00d7540 185 KB   It was a very intense\u2013nine-to-five\u2013workshop based on design thinking. We needed to make sure not to invite too many people. We wanted to have seven to nine guests, but, at the conference itself, there was a sense of serendipity, and we ended up inviting two more.  I am still amazed that we could get eleven people together in that room. I am not sure if we will ever reunite this kind of group again. For this particular niche, it is an impressive lineup.  After the workshop, we connected with all these people and built a relationship with them. We created a Telegram group, and we kept seeing each other over the week. I feel this experience will become extremely valuable in the months to come as we try to figure out ways to improve our governance.       DevConnect Conference - Double Diamond960\u00d7540 546 KB   We designed the workshop based on the Double Diamond model.  We designed the workshop based on the Double Diamond model. The program switches between divergent and convergent thinking constantly. In that process, you try to capture the input of everyone\u2019s minds while aggregating and clustering, creating abstraction from all that; that way, you can effortlessly figure out the most relevant problems and solutions.     DevConnect Conference - Identify Challenges960\u00d7540 355 KB   We started with introductions and creating a shared context. At a certain point, we wrote down all the challenges and frustrations that we face being part of a governance system on sticky notes. We put those on the wall, and everyone took about fifteen minutes in silence to take notes for themselves. Then we tried to get duplicates and cluster them to create categories.   DevConnect Conference - Find Synergies960\u00d7540 389 KB   There was a form of abstraction in that process. You begin to understand where lay each participant\u2019s interests and main concerns. Groups were forming around that.   DevConnect Conference - Sharing Methods960\u00d7540 418 KB   Tiago shared ideation methods from the Design Thinking methodology framework. He has been doing this for some time. He was helpful.   DevConnect Conference - Jamming960\u00d7540 568 KB   This was the most fun part of the workshop.  This was the most fun part of the workshop. Although some stayed inside the venue, the three sub-teams went out into the city to jam together. My team found a nice spot near the water, and we used street signs as whiteboards to work on a challenge statement and do ideation. It was fun, and we had plenty of good conversations.  We were able to empathize with one another. For example, I was on a team with someone pretty high up at Yearn. He is involved in figuring out how to scale that DAO. Yearn is a different dial from Maker: there was no \u2018Yearn foundation.\u2019 Yearn started from scratch. Nevertheless, we are all dealing with the same challenges on a certain level.   On the left, Laura from Other Internet, a research collective. I am utterly impressed by their work. They wrote research reports about communities and DAOs and reported on Uniswap and gathered many insights. It was absolutely interesting to spend the afternoon with these people.     DevConnect Conference - Pitch Time960\u00d7540 325 KB   From time to time, we got together as a group to do some intermediate pitching and give each other input and feedback.   DevConnect Conference - Final Pitches960\u00d7540 412 KB   Every team presented one concept that they worked on that might be interesting for the other groups to pursue.  25:04  DevConnect Conference - Biggest Challenges960\u00d7540 359 KB   Looping back to the first exercise we did, Tiago and I still have some work to do digitalizing everything and creating a slide deck or a spreadsheet to make all the challenges and problems we identified available. This week has been messy; it is a conference week. We have not been able to do that yet.  Despite this, we can say that the top three challenges that participants voted on were related to Onboarding, Accountability, and Participation.  Onboarding is related to designing a beginner-friendly process for DAOs. One that does not involve sending too many resources to new entrants that need too much contextual knowledge.  Accountability is interesting. How do we hold teams accountable for their work after their funds have been rewarded? For example: once a research grant proposal has passed or a team budget proposal has passed, what we often see in DAOs, is that there is a lack of accountability processes.  Compared to Web2, if two companies were engaging in some collaboration, it usually would start with a signed quote. Then you would have payment terms and such. There are a lot of legal milestones that create an accountability structure. That is what is lacking in DAOs, generally speaking.    Participation is obvious, and it is the most relevant to Maker. How might we incentivize quality governance contributions that are pure voting participation rates and engage in discussion and co-authoring proposals, et?   I almost forgot to mention: we will share all the results\u2013including all of the abstracted governance challenges that we surfaced\u2013on our Twitter (@MakerDUX) later.   DevConnect Conference - Onboarding I960\u00d7540 520 KB   The first team focused on Onboarding, and their challenge statement was: \u201cHow might we empower interested new members to self-select their role and contributions to a DAO?\u201d    DevConnect Conference - Onboarding II960\u00d7540 421 KB   The core concept behind what they came up with is a diamond-shaped onboarding flow that acts like a funnel, where the first steps of the onboarding process are noob-friendly, narrow, and agnostic to DAO.  It is primal to understand where people\u2019s interests are, their skillset, and their availability. This knowledge will not be specific to any particular DAO.  As the members move on and progress through this funnel, the following steps and exercises will become personal and more specific to DAOs. At one point, these practices should optimize for self-selection. If a contributor follows through with this onboarding flow, it should be relatively easy to understand what might be a good role for them to participate in Web3 and which DAO might be a good fit.   Another engaging aspect of this design is that it aims for a quick win: In the first days or weeks of the process, when the new member is guided and supported in their contributions to the DAO\u2013which can be minor\u2013, there should be a sense of reward and motivation. This is also a potential solution to the need for contextual knowledge. For example, if I were to share the Maker Operational Manual, which I like and think is a good resource, it could be overwhelming with someone who has zero knowledge about Maker. In parallel to this onboarding funnel, there should be a DAO Librarian. This is a new role for DAOs. The Librarian would be in charge of guiding the people entering this onboarding flow if they want to learn more about specific subjects or whenever they get stuck. The Librarian should be up to speed when managing existing resources, what is happening in the DAO, and any potential opportunities.   This is the first concept that the team surfaced. And it is just a concept. No one is currently working on it. This shows that if you get a group of people together in a room and get them to focus on a challenge statement, they can whip up a solution feasible to implement for existing DAOs in only a few hours.  That was the goal of the day. To experience that and come up with some good ideas applicable to existing DAO systems. Too many people are talking about new DAO governance frameworks starting from scratch, but that will not be valuable for the existing governance systems.    30:56  DevConnect Conference - Accountability I960\u00d7540 499 KB   The second team focused on Accountability, and their challenge statement was: \u201cHow might we hold teams accountable for their work after their grant/budget proposal has been approved?\u201d    DevConnect Conference - Accountability II960\u00d7540 139 KB   They came up with a process innovation where they defined requirements for proposals that request treasury fund spending. This requires a definition of success or a definition of done written objectively and measurable way.  The authors of said proposals should spend time thinking about that, and they should explicitly include those definitions in their proposal. This should be based on the nature of the work.  It should be easy to find a definition of done for a product-related endeavor. A definition of success would be more fitting for a research project or a growth initiative\u2013which is also more complex to define measurably, but still\u2013.   For proposals that exceed a certain threshold for the number of funds spent, that proposal should also include appointed members of a committee of advisors.  Advisors can be individuals from other teams within the DAO or individuals from other DAOs\u2013who might need compensation to be a part of this committee\u2013.       DevConnect Conference - Accountability III960\u00d7540 162 KB   After the governance vote, the committee of advisors will involve in periodic progress reporting and evaluations of that particular team.  The concept is similar to that of an investor board. If you are a Web2 investor, an investor board can be valuable because it provides a safe space to talk about how things are transpiring, and it can help figure out where to go next and how to deal with certain challenges.  This also makes for a good accountability setup. These individuals are appointed to your committee of advisors; they associate with your team, initiative, and work. If they are not happy with your work, they will hold you accountable. To make that more explicit, the committee of advisors could be required to approve budget top-ups or periodic payments based on performance. These advisors would be staking their reputation by associating themselves with these teams or initiatives. That adds to the overall accountability setup.     This process innovation should be feasible to implement for existing DAO governance systems\u2013including Maker\u2013and it would be a great way to round up the accountability aspect. And I agree: accountability is difficult in DAOs.   DevConnect Conference - Participation I960\u00d7540 431 KB   The third team\u2013the team that Payton was on, I like what they have been working on\u2013focused on Participation. Their challenge statement was: \u201cHow might we incentivize quality contributions to DAO governance?\u201d   DevConnect Conference - Participation II960\u00d7540 459 KB   Their concept is called Vested Voting Incentives, an incentivization mechanism where a protocol must provide funds for incentivizing governance participation.  The idea is that the distribution will be calculated based on an equation with several inputs. It will not be only about voting participation or voting weight\u2013in our case, this would be MKR Token holdings\u2013but it could also be about the extent of the contributions of a certain individual\u2013for example, co-authored passed proposals\u2013. It could be related to forum participation, communication, and their activity on proposals that passed, so you can figure out to what extent the voting of this member is in sync with where the votes have been going in general. These incentives would be vested over a year. The rewards could be in the native governance token, stables, NFTs, etcetera.    35:57  DevConnect Conference - Participation III960\u00d7540 413 KB   My favorite aspect of this idea is that these incentives will be split between the delegates and the delegators. This makes an interesting mechanism that incentivizes delegation.  Suppose an individual feels like they will not be active enough in governance to do well in this incentivization scheme. In that case, there will be an incentive for this individual to delegate their tokens to a good, active delegate. Then, this individual would still catch some upside of the hard work of their delegate, thus, incentivizing delegation.  I feel like this is an unsolved problem, especially at Maker, which might be something to consider. I am looking forward to continuing talking about this, Payton, once the dust settles.     Once again, this is compatible with existing coin-voting systems. It is a mechanism of incentivization that should be feasible to implement.   DevConnect Conference - In Short960\u00d7540 329 KB   The main takeaway that I shared in the talk is that we should prioritize DAO governance, which is difficult because DAO governance is an interconnected domain. It is hard to get stuff done as an individual team. You need to do cross-CU coordination. We should also apply Design Thinking methodologies when designing the UX and designing incentivization mechanisms or new processes. Try to have the various stakeholders in mind and empathize with them.  Try to utilize this methodology while thinking about these things. It greatly succeeds in putting the users center stage.   We should innovate on processes, policies, incentives, and governance tooling levels. We can all agree that there are better voting mechanisms than coin-voting, but the truth is that it is difficult to change that for existing DAO systems.  There is plenty of low-hanging fruit for processes, policies, and such. Let us focus our efforts there.   The last point I made is to collaborate with cross-DAO governance big brains. There is plenty of wisdom out there.  To a certain degree, we are all dealing with similar issues. There is a lot to learn from one another. I am really happy that, as a core unit, DUX is moving in that direction, collaborating with other CUs more closely compared to half a year ago. We created many good connections out of this particular conference. We are going to be able to leverage that.   That was, basically, the talk that I gave. It would now make sense to have a low-key discussion or bring up suggestions about things we could do or innovations on the abovementioned levels that might be useful for Maker and how we might coordinate that.  There is a lot already happening behind the scenes, but it could be fruitful to open this up for a broader discussion at the G&R call.    39:44  Prose11: I thought this did an excellent job capturing what we were jamming on and the problems we are facing. I see Kianga, one of our recognized delegates. Do you want to take it away?  Kianga: Yes, that was terrific. I love seeing our leadership for the broader ecosystem. We have a lot to offer. We often talk about our challenges, and it is valuable information. He is dropping in another community orca protocol, one of the participants presented, and I think he will pay dividends across several things. We are also talking about our goals, growth brand, all these things; taking what we do here every day, what you have done, and being a leader and helping teach and convene leaders and other protocols is fantastic, thank you.   Prose11: Thank you. As a participant, I could not thank you more; that was an excellent workshop. I know the connections I got and having other brains bounce problems off like Thiago does, obviously for the facilitation. He kept our group in check as well. We were nerding out over governance things, which provided us to be productive, which was an important nudge.   Open Discussion  Speaker 41:59  Robert: I am all for accountability, and I think we need more of it and the DAO; the question is: how much? As I mentioned in the chat, this is not intuitive and is not straightforward. There are no best practices and working from a DAO. I am glad to hear that we are way ahead, Dennis. I feel we are a huge DAO figuring out problems. I am excited about that, and at the same time, it is just a balancing act. I want to be held accountable. I want to make sure my team\u2019s work is valuable. We are contributing to the DAO. However, it gets challenging if I have 20 bosses and I am going for re-approval every month or every quarter. It is especially challenging to retain full-time people because they do not know if their jobs are in jeopardy every time I go around for one of these discussions, so there are many things to consider. I am grateful for the work that is being done. I appreciate everything that we are considering, but just something to keep in mind.  Prose11: Thank you, Monkey Irish facilitator of the Collateral Engineering Services CU - for anyone unfamiliar. I know that came up, but a couple of the panels and discussions and this question of how do you have discussions about performance in the DAO space? Right? Because obviously, it takes much labor from many different individuals to address concerns. If all you are doing is talking about performance, you are not performing either. It is a balancing act and not an easy question to solve.   Robert: I will give a specific example because of a sense of transparency. I have been hiring a team, and that is challenging in itself. Before we had a full team, and on May 11th, maybe I will start our final full-time hire, we are also hiring an engineer. What is interesting is that now that team is built out. We are not wearing multiple hats, and now we have the opportunity to circle back around and work with each of the people on my team to set specific goals, roles, and responsibilities. And beforehand. We ran all over the place, trying to get things done and organized to know what we were doing. I had the overall vision of what I felt we needed to do at CES. Because of the experience, we know that we understand how the DAO works, and basically, it is a design and moves forward. Grab feedback where you can but keep pushing. Do not wait is a key learning experience we have had because people may or may not give you feedback; you will get feedback when you get things out there. Keep moving forward is the best advice that I could give.  45:14  Prose11: Thanks, Robert. It is helpful to ground that with an example. I see Wouter in the chat saying that there should be much more continuous feedback, rather than just either reaffirming budgets or extreme earthquake events, referring to whether it is off-boarding or completely denying a budget. These things can derail not just an individual team but also the DAO and a lot of the people contributing. Keep in mind that the things we did not workshop were just people throwing their heads together and trying to develop their best solution in a day. That does not mean that it is an optimal solution. I was pretty intrigued by the ideas of how we could better hold people accountable.  David Utrobin: One idea that I saw was that each CU would have a board of advisors that keeps it in check. I like this idea because we have one problem right now: CU and their output are looked at various quantitatively; it is de-personalized. When you have a dedicated individual looking in to ensure their team is accountable, they also get to feel for different things that might change. This could be a change in objective, context, or obstacle out of your control, which puts your team back by a quarter. I like the personal aspect of having that kind of advisor. Having a group comprised of professionals who have had some experience would also be great to share best practices and get that more continuous feedback loop in place. From my team\u2019s perspective right now, I get that with a few individuals, but it would be pretty cool to get formalized and have dedicated people that can follow along with the story in the case of your team.   Kianga: I have a question in terms of onboarding. I love seeing how we are reactivating Twitter, and we have the Discord; it is a question of how we are thinking about each of these spaces in terms of onboarding, location for the community, and the hierarchy if that makes sense. As a delegate, how should I prioritize where I spend time or keep up? Is there a sense that the Discord is where most new people start? Is that more so happening on Reddit? Is it happening simultaneously? Anyone\u2019s observations in terms of our different spaces: how do you think it is currently perceived or used in terms of the onboarding process of new people?  Prose11: Who is our target audience when we are talking about onboarding? Who are the people we are trying to reach? How are they getting to us on the platform?   Someone: I believe we should also ask what type of users, right? Are they looking to contribute to governance? Are they looking to use vaults? Are they looking to use Dai? Well, what are users?  49:48  Kianga: And for all the CU, are you keeping up with where people engage? There are threads and channels in the Discord, the forum. Do you have an everyday practice? Like checking different channels. Are you seeing that one particular channel or app is where a certain type of activity or conversation happens versus others? In your day-to-day, how are you engaging across all our main spaces?  DUX: From my experience working for MakerDAO, users previously on RocketChat now on Discord are much closer to the protocol and the things happening at the protocol. Then, you have social media, people who engage with Maker DAO, which is probably more like engaging in a DeFi level or a crypto level and not on a governance level.   Prose11: Sure, and to echo that, I bet, Chris, you had a good comment in the chat pointing out that depending on what you are going for, people tend to go in two different directions. Perhaps CU is a little biased because moderation is a part of it. Also, in theory, these are things that we want everyone to be able to read and engage with. It is important to think about how much time it takes to split up and keep track of everything.  Deniz DUX: This week, I spoke to many people also from other DAOs. I feel we should be asking ourselves what we are trying to achieve or what kind of people we are trying to reach when we are talking about improving the governance system. For example, suppose you are a DeFi protocol that secures billions of dollars in value. Why you pursue decentralization and a healthy governance system is entirely different from many other projects I have discussed here. For example, when I talked to someone from Live Peer yesterday, they were doing all kinds of things to figure out how to decentralize or whatever they were trying to bootstrap their communities to launch DAO and lean into the community to do Decentralized Governance. However, I was like: your problem is that you are looking for people to use your product, so you should be going for the content creators who are now putting their stuff on YouTube and other platforms. That is a whole different audience, and it is also a whole different purpose for pursuing decentralization. I think it also indicates this is a personal opinion. Still, I believe that something like Maker, the governance of a protocol, is not something we should pursue. Every user should participate in all governance roles because the governance votes need much knowledge. I will say that the first question we should be asking is, what are we trying to achieve? What kind of persons are we trying to engage and then apply this design thinking principle to empathize with particular individuals and try to see ways to activate them further and retain their attention in this space where there are many opportunities.    55:00  David Utrobin: Another interesting aspect of this problem is that we are building a large organization that manages a ton of money. We need and want highly talented people, but the problem is that because crypto has such a high barrier to entry - there are just a lot fewer talented people that are also crypto natives that you can bring in. One challenge is getting people from outside of the crypto world into a DAO, so my team has had a little bit of experience with that. Our third full-time hire was Thomas Flitter. He had 10 to 15 years of engagement, leadership experience, and the US energy industry, so he came in two GovComms, not as a crypto native. I could tell you the learning curve was long: it took a couple of months to wrap them up, to ramp him up. I think it is now six months out, and there are constantly things he is learning to get himself more: more aware of how the DAO works as an organization, what our actual products are, and who use our products and get the entire understanding of the business. There is a massive challenge in finding those highly talented people and bringing them in because historically, Maker has thrived from just finding very passionate and talented individuals to build the organization. We are getting to a place where we need even more specialization and higher degrees of talent. Another key I see is finding those people and later bringing in the passion.  Prose11: Thanks, David. That was onboarding. That was another one of the things we tackled in the workshop because I think everyone who attended mentioned that it is a pain point in crypto regardless of your DAO\u2019s focus.   David Utrobin: Yes, shout out to Colby Anderson. He is doing a Maker Academy Incubating a project. I think it is a CU, but I am not sure.  Deniz DUX: I would like to hear opinions on what things you believe we should be trying to improve regarding our governance system: the voting system, governance processes, policies, and incentives. People think about this every day, and initiatives run behind the scenes. Does anyone want to share any thoughts on that? They might be helpful to us.   Robert: I will share something, MonkeyIrish. Anything that we can do around understanding strategic objectives and how each of the CU can plug into that at a data level would be super helpful. I realized there had been some talk about how potentially we would decide to do that: some of the tools that might be available for us to do that, as well. I think it would be a real big help for the DAO - and there are different opinions - I realized this would be super helpful to know that the work I am doing as a CU is strategic and valuable for the DAO. Based on the feedback and the input that I get already, I can decide, but it is nice to know that we are working towards some common goals.  1:00:18  Someone: Yes, I would echo that sentiment. One thing you get in the hierarchical, centralized organization is clear top-down direction. While I think the DAO has many strengths, I would say that is a weakness of the model: knowing whether or not we are all strategically aligned and working in the same direction, even in broad strokes. It would be nice to know that even if CU has some autonomy or the autonomy to execute, we were all tugging the ship in the same direction.  Deniz DUX: This reminds me of a conversation I had with Payton yesterday: this is what we talked about. As a DAO, I am impressed by how well the CU model has held up to keep the lights on and everything running. It is challenging to find consensus on the more abstract topics: like growth strategies and the big picture stuff. Usually, the big picture stuff is handled by C-level individuals or the board of investors because they are not bogged down with the operational stuff: they have the big picture. I feel that Maker - and Payton agreed there; also, many people think that we lacked the collaboration and infrastructure to discuss this. Many quality discussions are happening on the forum and Discord. I feel we have a lot of leaders or thought leaders in this in this community, but we do not have the infrastructure or the platforms to have like proper debates about these bigger things and try to try to get a feel of what the sides are right and what their arguments are. It seems like a challenging thing to coordinate in that timeframe. I feel there is potential in figuring out a platform for that to have those debates in a structured manner.   Prose11: Yes, I would love to be working on it, spending a little time and collaborating with others to figure out the best way to bring that; it was exciting getting to talk with Dennis about this. I am grateful to participate and share this with the DAO because I think bringing in different perspectives and being willing to talk about the pain points is one of our biggest strengths. Historically, MakerDAO has been good at acknowledging risks and drawbacks; how can we improve the situation?  Will: I agree. I think the question is how to get more value than MKR token holders expect. Then, the issue at times is distribution in the CE level of MKR. Token holders are distributed: it is hard to get a standard view for many of them. In a DAO, a force of proposition appears that comes from the bottom over to MKR. The bottom is the agents in operations. The agents coordinate together as different CU facilitators and teams. They work together on our strategy and propose that back to the MKR holders. The people who are not involved in the operations can say yes or no to any opposition force. That is probably the biggest challenge, which involves the whole aspect of the allocation. They have independent teams working on their verticals of what they think is essential for the DAO, and they have to raise that to the CE level in a coordinated fashion. That is not only individual, their CU, but actually, it is to the whole DAO, so that is probably the biggest challenge. Seeing a little bit of a workshop where the team has done their design thinking, I think it is perhaps possible to leverage some of those frameworks to develop those Dai level principles and the direction of travel. This is an alternative model to what we have been doing until now.    1:06:10  Prose11: Thanks. I see the discussion in the chat about token holders, how we value their opinions, the extent we use that to guide our future structure, and the optimal path for doing so. We will not solve all these significant challenges in one call. I appreciate everyone willing to discuss these issues. Meantime, let me give a massive shout-out to Thiago for the workshop that we had on Monday. In addition, he also helped put together some of those awesome graphics on the slide; they brought our ideas to life. Thank you, Thiago and Dennis. I love to see a lot of the side chat continue on the forums, I think discussing budgets, direction, and prioritization is something we will be focusing on coming up here. Moreover, we would love to make sure we get those all shared, even if the GNR may not be the best, best way to preserve that, so please, if you are so inclined, the type that up on the forum, and we can continue the conversation there. Thank you for joining us. Like I said, please keep it going in the forums. We will be back same time, the same place next week.
