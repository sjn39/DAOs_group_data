Many people oppose it. Here are some arguments why fee burning is a bad idea.   Psychology.  People simply are not used to burning money. It feels unfair and wasteful.   Miners feel victimized since the network prefers to burn money vs paying miners.   Security.  Fee burning will immediately affect the security of the network, as the hash rate is paid by miners. Less money for miners means a lesser hash rate.   Fairness.  Fee burning is good for whales since it makes the price of the token higher.  Bad for miners.   So rich guys will become richer at the expense of guys that secure the network.   Fairness.  Small miners invested in hardware. Noone told them about fee burning.  Now they will make much less money.   Changing rules is unfair.   Can cause ETH to Fork.  Many miners are so unhappy, they are openly talking about forking the network.   ",

GPU miners invested in hardware with the expectation that ASICs would not be allowed on the network. 1559 just further agitates the miners as they see developers working with other communities to help profitability. The difference however it is written in the yellow paper that Ethereum opposes ASICs. ",

The magnitude of this upwards pressure doesn\u2019t seem to have been quantitatively modeled in the existing simulation notebooks (probably as a result of it being an explicit non-goal of this proposal to minimize user transaction costs, despite what many people seem to think around the internet). Effectively, fee burning acts as a transfer of value from the transaction user to the ETH holder, which brings me to another major counter-argument (acknowledged by the EIP-1559 proposal text itself): It precludes fixed supply, making the inflationary behavior of the currency even more difficult to predict with this proposal.  I don\u2019t question the utility of a progressively deflationary monetary policy (like Bitcoin\u2019s) as means to preserve the value of the currency, but this way of doing things seems like a bit of a gamble to me (as it might to other investors), since it\u2019s basically impossible to predict beforehand whether the fee burn will exceed the block reward or not (The modification other people have suggested of banking and redistributing base fees would address this problem).

I guess if the function is only to rally the troops (i.e. solidify existing support) then it might do that. But again, if the troops know it to be a bad argument, will it not fail to rally them? All five of your arguments boil down to miners and their reduced profitability. So it\u2019s one argument and one that\u2019s entirely anticipated. I personally think that Ethereum\u2019s user experience is so horrible that miners have it quite good compared to users. So a tradeoff between the two makes sense. Not to mention that miners have benefited from multiple years of delay in proof-of-stake, and they may well see multiple years more. If I were them, I would be focused on getting the Ethash replacement done, which has been unfairly delayed and unscrupulously maligned for far too long. ",
