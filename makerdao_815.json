Shoutout to @blimpa for the graphics, @LongForWisdom for the coordination, and @Patrick_J for owning the Recognized Delegate process.  @TheExistence cooking up an off-chain incentivization proposal for the community, currently being reviewing and refined by GovAlpha leadership.   Quarterly Focuses  Participation  As highlighted, we brought a new Recognized Delegate aboard last week.  @hernandoagf has been crushing a Governance Dashboard Prototype, linking to last weeks version so we don\u2019t leak too much alpha    @LongForWisdom and @prose11 continue to work with DUX for framing on-chain incentivization.   Exploration   @Gala and @Sebix have been training under @blimpa for processing MIPs, while this might be more of an \u201cother,\u201d their work is crucial for maintaining a resilient and decentralized governance team.  @prose11 met with @layerzero and @astrogator to give feedback and explore a method for requesting legal review of new proposals.  @AstronautThis continued Maker Operational Manual work, much of which is being translated for the Spanish-speaking community by @Sebix.
