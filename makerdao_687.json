During a Debt Auction, MKR is minted by the system (increasing the amount of MKR in circulation), and then sold to bidders for DAI. Doesn\u2019t this action devalue MKR as its total supply increases? If yes, then what is the economic incentive behind buying a token which is being devalued by design? Is it like the existence of Surplus action, where DAI is sold for MKR, keeps the system functional? ",

This mechanic removes MKR from the circulating supply, which should increase the value of MKR over time. If MKR holders govern the protocol poorly, in such a way it leads to unbacked Dai and debt in the protocol, the surplus buffer will over time be emptied, which will cause flop auctions, where new MKR is minted by the system and sold off in the market to recapitalize the debt in the system. This mechanism dillutes the MKR supply, and causes the price of MKR to go down. ",
