Under the supervision of @blimpa, Gala has taken on nearly all duties expected of a MIP Editor while offering perspective on how we can improve our MIPs-related output. I have full confidence in Gala and trust her judgement on all MIPs related maters. For the community, not too much should change but we have another officially appointed person to deliver decisions about MIPs and take ownership over the process. We expect to continue our rise in MIPs-related content and with another official MIP Editor we believe we can keep serving the community and delivering value to MKR holders.  A bit overdue, @Gala. Thank you for your continued commitment to the team and I look forward to seeing all you accomplish in your official duties  ",
