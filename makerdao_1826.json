                    "content": " Overview The Asset Allocation for MIP65 was set 20/6/2022. Much has changed since then in the capital markets (!) and consequently we\u2019d like to propose a change to this asset allocation. Here\u2019s the previous Asset Allocation Poll for reference.  Proposal We would like to propose reallocating the DAI 250M, initially allocated towards a mixed, medium-term focused, corporate and government bond investment mandate with Baillie Gifford, to ISIN IE00BGSF1X88 : 0-1y US Treasury ishares/Blackrock ETF product resulting in the following ultimate allocation of the DAI 500M under MIP65:     Amount ETF W. Avg. YTM W. Avg. Maturity 3y SD     350M 0-1y US TreasuryIE00BGSF1X88 3.5% 0.37 0.38%   150M 1-3y US TreasuryIE00BYXPSP02 4.3% 1.86 1.77%     Considerations This reallocation proposal is a reaction to two principal concerns:  Corporate Bond performance under a recession This could be the best time in history to buy Corporate Bonds - or it could be the worst. Recession is more and more a definite and we - nor anybody else - has a crystal ball to predict how the corporate bond market would react under a prolonged period of recession. We feel uncomfortable making a bet on this market. We might have been comfortable moving towards highest quality Corporate Bonds (AAA), but our concern about general market volatility (below) leads us to unfortunately propose leaving this asset class for the time being.  General market volatility Just about all asset markets have increased dramatically in market-value volatility - for many reasons. The recent UK Gilt shock is a good example of the current materially increased randomness put into the capital markets dynamic system. Whilst we might be comfortable about the long-term return and value of highly rated (AAA) corporate Bonds and long-term Government Bonds, we are concerned about short-term shocks in market-values that could lead to sentiment-driven negative extreme shock actions on Maker and DAI. Thus we, for the time being, propose fundamentally only deploying capital towards short-term government bonds in a highly liquid ETF product.  1139\u00d7493 93.4 KB  ICE BoFAML MOVE Index (essentially measures volatility in bond markets) The resulting portfolio above is more a \u201cCollect basic yield and wait-and-see where the world goes\u201d portfolio than a \u201cbet\u201d on a particular path for the world economy. We would expect to propose a further reallocation as the world economy finds a more stable trajectory.  Our patient friends at Baillie Gifford This reallocation is, of course, a disappointment as we were keen to start work with Baillie Gifford and engage them further with the Maker Community. Luckily Baillie Gifford is 114 years old and takes a long-term view on things such as partnerships. This reallocation closes no doors with Baillie Gifford and we hope to include them in any future reallocation discussions when the world economy shows some basic stability in direction (pending, of course, how regulations and compliance requirements develop - as we all know - this area remains in substantive flux in most countries on crypto). We will remain positively engaged with Baillie Gifford to explore opportunities and thank them for their engagement with Maker so far and hope we find ways to collaborate soon.  Asset Reallocation Vote on MIP65 / DAI 250M     Reallocate to ISIN IE00BGSF1X88 : 0-1y US Treasury ishares/Blackrock ETF Do not reallocate Abstain     0 voters      Next Step This signal will run until Sunday, 2022-10-23T00:00:00Z. If more than 50% of the non-abstaining votes are in favour it will move to an on-chain poll on Monday, Oct 24th. ",

We came independently in the view over the last months that credit/duration risks have little to offer in the current situation. We will soon get (?) 4% \u201crisk-free\u201d so what\u2019s the point on getting to 5.5% with risk? Especially as we are still in the learning phase. It is not so much additional basis points that should be the focus for now, but how to have a bigger base invested. Should such a Signal Request succeed, it will be used to indicate a non-binding sentiment of the MakerDAO community towards prospectives \u201casset managers\u201d/liquidity strategies. IB01 is not without duration risk, but with an average duration of 0.4 years, any mark-to-market loss would quickly be covered by the 3.43% yield to maturity  (a 100bps unexpected rate hike would be amortized in a month). It is the shorter duration treasury bonds we have to chose from. The fact that we invest by 50M bulk is also good to mitigate this risk. I am also disappointed that we are not investing right now with Baillie Gifford. Working with a separately managed account (SMA) and a top tier asset manager will provide more flexibility and probably a better optimization. It is quite complementary to a ETF investments. Nevertheless, KYC is still in process and so I view it is only as a delay. Proposing a thread for community to have a more broader discussion on the short-term bonds strategy. Feel free to discuss the broader topic there and the specifics of MIP65 here. ",

                    "content": "A few thoughts for you. Let me start by showing you two charts from Pensford - maybe you have seen them before.   My bet would be that Fed will probably hike in November (75bps), December(50bps) and once next year(25bps) - and then it will take 1 year or so to start reducing rates - to ensure transmission into the economy - hike has been very fast. That is somewhat a good case I guess. I think a good number of countries will have to truly throw in the towel if increasing rates are going to continue over 2023 at the current blazing pace. Anyhow - stable market are not expected for quite some months to come in my basic view. A duration of 0.37 - with this backdrop - may not produce us to largest returns, but ensures lowest market value variability - which is really what I am most worried about. The markets are hypersensitive and seem to be reacting almost violently to small upsets - and I am concerned that this hypersensitivity can be even amplified in \u201ccrypto-land\u201d - a paper market-value loss on a small portfolio can lead to very odd behaviours when everybody is on the edge. So I like a very short duration portfolio that can somewhat follow the movements that seem reasonably sensible to expect being in store and that doesn\u2019t act out too much in even extreme cases. If all goes well rate stability comes in February/March (I hope!) and we can start thinking a bit more long-term on assets that have a market-value consequence we need to consider - and reallocate to something more interesting. Remember this is an allocation made to sit in the low-risk/high liquid/large scale bottom of the balance sheet pyramid. Not the small, high-yielding, private asset, long-term top-end of the pyramid. So primary focus probably is stability with some return, which today, my bet is, only really comes in the form of very short US Treasuries. \u2026and - I guess - if I am wrong - ie. you could have made more return on longer durations safely - well then that is a better kind of wrong, than if someone is wrong about being in longer duration bonds and gets a market-value smack-down that ignites all kinds of drama.

While I am sure that all/most our delegates can handle the complexity of this signal request, I think in the future it would be useful, at least for  `methodological\u2019 reasons, to ask a third (external) opinion to inform better the community and delegates. What I mean is something similar to what, e.g. PECU, asks regularly for critical new smart-contracts: an external audit with a clear professional report and opinion, that anybody can read. This said I have a very naive question:     SebVentures:  We will soon get (?) 4% \u201crisk-free\u201d so what\u2019s the point on getting to 5.5% with risk? Especially as we are still in the learning phase. It is not so much additional basis points that should be the focus for now, but how to have a bigger base invested.   QUESTION: why not going 100% with 0-1y US Treasury (IE00BGSF1X88)? ",

This validated the investment in t-bonds. For the details it\u2019s more like parameters of Liq2.0 given by risk or what the MOMC is proposing (which I hope the MOMC will take the duty to ease the burden at some point). Going all in on 0-1y is an option probably. It\u2019s just that it start to be very small nuances that don\u2019t matter much. An allocation to 1-3yr will be needed at some point so we might as well keep it to avoid too much transaction fees. Using the 0-1yr is really a liquidity buffer (imperfect but the best we have in this structure). The goal of this reallocation is more to remove the credit risk which there will be no longer in MIP65. ",
