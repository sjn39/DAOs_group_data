The ability to flash mint Ethereum will be critical to Defi\u2019s market efficiency. It allows the arbitrage of much smaller price discrepancies since users no longer need to pay flash loan fees. Late transaction value debiting can be implemented in clients with extremely small changes, compared to dedicated flash mint opcodes and precompiles. ",
