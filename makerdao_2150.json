                    "content": "As you may have noticed, I just posted so-called \u201cskeleton drafts\u201d of all of the 12 Scope Frameworks, to enter them into RFC. Stability and Liquidity, Decentralized Collateral and Real World Asset Collateral also have actual content to be used as a starting point for the final content that will go to a vote. The next step is to edit these in a public process during the course of the MIP RFC period, so that they can contain the necessary logic to support the launch of the Pregame Maker Constitution when it becomes active late march, if the votes are successful. This week there will be no Endgame call, but when we start up next week we will transition to 3 calls per week, on Tuesdays, Wednesday and Thursdays. All will happen at 8pm CET and last 1.5 hours. The focus will now be practical edits and considerations of the Scope Frameworks to prepare them for activation. Next week, tuesday 14th, wednesday 15th and thursday 16th, we will focus on the Stability and Liquidity Scope, the Decentralized Collateral Scope and the Real World Asset Scope. Since these already have content, there is a good starting point for thinking about concerns, challenges, game theory, missing content and other gaps etc. If you leave posts and comments and input in the relevant threads, or prepare input and feedback for the calls themselves, we will be able to rapidly iterate and improve them with the necessary updates in preparation for launch. Important to keep in mind: As soon as the Scope Frameworks are approved, we should expect them to be immediately edited the following month, and every month there after for the first many months. So right now our most important goal should be on the most practical key requirements that must be designed and specified so that nothing breaks in April - already in May we can have another update, that we can prepare over the course of March, so the focus here in February really should be as short term and practical as possible since this is the time to determine what will be in effect in the very beginning in April. The following week, tue/wed/thurs 21/22/23 we will focus on the other 4 Scope Frameworks that are critical for April: Ecosystem, Protocol Engineering, Finance and Arbitration. This will cover many different topics, and I will provide the skeleton content for each of them in advance to give the necessary context - the most complicated will be Ecosystem and Arbitration, which will have to clearly define how exactly we should expect the Constitutional Voter Committees and their subcommittee meetings to work, and how Constitutional Delegates will work. We also need to define a lot of budgets for Incubated Ecosystem Actors that are being reorganized from the Core Units for Endgame, and the milestones and KPIs to monitor of them as we take baby steps towards project based funding. Also please read the Constitutional Boundaries text that is written at the bottom of the Maker Constitution, for the critical Scope Frameworks. The text is of course still just placeholder, but it provides useful context to help consider what kind of feedback and input to provide. ",
