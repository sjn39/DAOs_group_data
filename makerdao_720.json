                    "content": " 240 Minutes of One-on-One Due Diligence with Proposed Talent CU Facilitator While attending EthDenver we had the pleasure of sitting  with @manomad on two separate occasions. We discussed his believes and traits as a former headhunter, and Human Resources generalist. We ask Mano to frame his goals as a talent CU facilitator. He explained his believe that he can deliver the Talent needed, as well as offer the current Core Units procedures that can be implemented if they choose to. We discussed the lack on an off-boarding process, the need for DAO\u2019s to implement Human Resources procedures, and the difficultly of implementing such because of the nature of DAOs. We discussed the battles encountered by SES when coordinating the Talent Core Unit, including but not limited to replacing Facilitator candidates, the difficulty creating a Talent Core Unit for a DAO, and the need to acquire New Talent that is not a friend-of-a-friend referral. These topics were opinionated from our end, and his. But throughout our conversation it became clear that SES has not properly prepared this Core Unit, and has possibly incubated a Core Unit that is not prepared to scale efficiently. Questions were ask with regards to possible improvements:  Mano pointed out how HR procedures could be benefiting to a DAO. He described the difficulty in finding people that know something about the workings of MakerDAO. But also the difficulty in finding people who have an interest and passion for the Ethereum + crypto ecosystem. We both agreed that Maker Academy is desperately needed in helping educate potential hires. We agreed that the Talent is out there and it is possible that MakerDAO can acquire the right kind of right.  During one of our two sit-downs, we discussed Mano\u2019s past successes which included hiring CES team-members by an external headhunter contributor. We discussed the tools needed in order for this CU to be successful. We felt that SES communication with Mano\u2019s, had not been aligned. One example of why we believe there\u2019s miss-communication between SES and Mano is KPI reporting. It is confusing to 3F Delegate as Mano has proposed to use a 3rd party tool/dashboard, versus the proposed SES Ecosystem Performance Dashboard.  3F Delegate believes SES attempt at Incubating a Talent Core Unit is Inadequate Since inception the search for a Talent Core Unit has been a rollercoaster adventure for @SES-Core-Unit. The search for a facilitator along with a structure that will work best for a decentralized community like MakerDAO has been a difficult and undefined task. We believe this undefined Talent CU vision occurred because SES is incubating multiple core units, and maybe there\u2019s a need for an experience SES team-member with previous experience in headhunting/HR that can help guide the incoming Talent CU properly. Perhaps SES should hire internally someone who has previously led a Headhunting Firm, worked as a Human Resource Officer/People Officer. Or perhaps SES has not had the time to consider such requirement in order to efficiently provide MakerDAO a Talent Core Unit, that will help this DAO achieve greatness. We understand that SES is busy scaling the DAO\u2013super appreciated\u2013you folks Rock! Therefore, we believe it will be necessary to hire extra-brain power in order to tackle each type of sector incubation efficiently, with proper direction, a roadmap, and the willingness to prepare to win. \u201cLots of people have the desire to win, maybe even the will to win. But very few people have the will to prepare to win.\u201d \u2013Bobby Knight 3F Delegate believe SES needs to incubate a Talent CU that will showcase how they will help CUs with onboarding, growth, retention, and off-boarding. A core unit that will showcase their talent in recruiting, before onboarding officially as a Core Unit\u2014a CU that has a gigantic list of candidates that can be hired if needed on day 1. We believe SES should have investigated prior to releasing Talent CU to a Vote, if existing Core Units want procedures related to Human Resources topics and if this is a vision the DAO wants to implement. The recent successful strategic focus @lenkla and her SES teammates placed on gathering Project Xray\u2013that same approach could have been used to understand if current CUs are open to HR procedures. Again, we believe SES might be overwhelmed with their current backlog.  Proposed Core Unit Facilitators & Team-Members  Need To be Anti-Fragile, Resilient, Showcase their Talent before Incubating The team-members you onboard defines the DAO you will create. The first lesson we can refer to is that choosing a founding-team wisely is the same as making sure you don\u2019t buy a house with a broken foundation\u2014a house with a broken foundation can\u2019t be fixed later. Core Unit Facilitators need to ask, \u201cwhy will our team build a winning-core unit in the category we are determined to create?\u201d And why is that   question important? Because creating a winning team within each Core Unit is the key to making sure MakerDAO\u2019s ultimate goal is aligned within the Core Unit. Teams that don\u2019t share common goals and values will not help MakerDAO achieve greatness. CU team members need to have complimentary skills and perspectives. We ask @manomad to take these lessons and display resilience. A great example of Facilitator resilience is @monkey.irish who was voted down by MKR token owners and bounced back with one of the highest Voter turnout in Governance Polling history. From top-whale MKR owners to goldfish MKR hodlers, All came out and voted in support for the onboarding of CES CU. And believe us! We watch Mano throughout the EthDenver conference hustle and grind every single day that we attended the conference, or at an evening event. Mano was there, hustling. We believe he has the hunger and has bought into the MakerDAO way. He is a community member\u2013no doubt. However, we believe Mano cannot create a hiring-forecast going 6-months out\u2013because either SES and the rest of the Core Units cannot help Mano visualized what is needed, or perhaps Mano as a facilitator tried and failed to analyze such requirements. An incoming Talent CU facilitator should have a list of potential candidates that are ready to onboard to established Core Units or/and incubating Core Units from day 1.  The Talent CU should also have their FTE/PTE ready to onboard. MakerDAO cannot wait 3 to 6 months to get things rolling. As @manomad knows, recruiting Talent takes full-dedication, spending many hours acquiring talent, and if the Facilitator is not passionate about recruiting, your Core Unit will fail to achieve greatness.  We ask SES to re-incubate a Talent Core Unit MakerDAO deserves. We ask Mano to be resilient, as we recognize his belief in MakerDAO, his hunger and beliefs in achieving greatness. We request from both SES and Mano to ask: \u201cwhat type of person should we hire to drive this DAO towards greatness?\u201d ",

                    "content": "Thanks for your kind words.  As of January 2022, I was part time being engaged to support the MakerTalent CU Facilitator with defining the talentCU strategy and budget Based on the comments of the community on the existing MIPs, review of relevant papers (e.g. ProjectXRay) and discussions we had with both SES and MakerDAO delegates about needs and priorities I suggested to make the scope more strategic, more comprehensive and much more decentralized. I proposed to build a decentralized operating model for the TalentCU, further leveraging the \u201cemployee experience\u201d operating model which has replaced traditional HR operating models already in the most agile and decentralized web2 companies (e.g., Airbnb, Netflix, Spotify, GE, Tata). This type of operating model is based on the insight that the experience an employee has with an organizations\u2019 people practices from the moment they enter until they exit, is key to setting yourself apart from your competitors. While this is very much the case for web2 companies already, it\u2019s even more so for fully decentralized and open-source environments like DAOs. The better experience contributors have with your people practices (e.g., hiring, onboarding, OKRs, performance, compensation, learning, internal mobility, exiting), the more eager they are willing to join and stay for the longer term. DAOs who fail to understand this will be nothing more than revolving doors. Core to this operating model is that the Talent CU acts as a center of expertise, researching, designing, and deploying scalable people practices empowering CUs to autonomously attract and retain core contributors in the most efficient manner. The central driver for defining challenges, needs and priorities for the Talent CU will not be the CU facilitators but the core contributors in general. This \u201cactively listening in\u201d to the contributors is being facilitated by the deployment of a contributor experience management platform that underpins all different touchpoints (e.g., hiring, onboarding, OKRs, performance, compensation, learning, internal mobility, exiting) a core contributor has along their journey with the DAO. This \u201clistening in\u201d enables the TalentCU to respond quickly if contributors indicate unhappiness with any of the people practices. Given we haven\u2019t deployed the contributor experience management platform yet we for now decided the 2022 priorities (hiring, on/offboarding, job evaluation & Compensation system, basic WFP) based on comments of the community on the previous MIPs, review of relevant papers (e.g. ProjectXRay) and discussions we had with both SES, Governance CU and MakerDAO delegates. Once the \u201ccontributor experience\u201d operating model has been successfully voted for, the TalentCU will also involve all relevant stakeholder groups to build each of the touchpoints of the contributor experience journey, so everyone is on the same page from the original needs analysis up to final deployment. While still pending final MIPs approval, the TalentCU is already actively talking with tooling companies to identify not only the right platform and tools but also to find a team that is willing to take the risk and work alongside MakerDAO to further adapt it to our specific web3 needs. Whenever TalentCU comes across tools that we believe could be interesting for other CUs as well then, we arrange CU introductions to the vendor accordingly. We so far have introduced two types of tools already to Governance CU of which one (Sobol) will be taken forward by them given it enables a nice visualization of the different stakeholder groups within MakerDAO and each CUs/person\u2019s role & responsibility within the DAO. Once they have deployed this tool TalentCU will make sure that every new core contributor to the DAO will have access to this tool as part of their onboarding as well. All tools that TalentCU may be deploying will be underbuilt with data analytics to provide much needed insights to the TalentCU and in partnership with SES we will decide which of the data analytics will be reported out to SES for inclusion in their CU Performance Dashboard as well. I am still very new to MakerDAO but as per my understanding the role of SES is providing procedural guidance to the new CUs and while there is always room for improvement their guidance has been adequate as far as I am concerned. Even more so, I decided to contribute to the TalentCU MIPs (despite massively being underpaid for it) because Wouter understood the model needed for success from the first conversation I had with him. His insights were quite remarkable given many traditional HR executives are not even able (or willing) to grasp the basic concept of the model which basically breaks the power of middlemen like HR Generalists in favor of HR specialists directly working based on input of the employees/contributors. Given few people within (and even outside) MakerDAO have had exposure to these kinds of advanced decentralized operating models which put the contributor experience at the center of everything, many questions and well-meant suggestions about outdated HR concepts, expectations of building centralized databases (if possible, overnight) and requests to provide output before we even have built the framework are suddenly popping up. This indicates more education and communication is needed from TalentCU side which we will happily provide although we may not be able to fully deliver this before the end of this voting cycle. As to your question to what my role will be moving forward, it is my understanding that there is only USD 5,000/m available to engage me until the MIPs has successfully been voted for. Given my level of seniority this gives you only a limited number of hours which for now are being used for developing the TalentCU OKRs, looking into tooling vendors and kickstarting a high-level project plan for the on-boarding/off-boarding part of the contributor journey. As to what may happen after the MIPs approval, I am still pending further clarification given nothing was budgeted for me as part of the TalentCU MIP even though I had indicated that I was willing to free up 75% of my time for MakerDAO.

                    "content": "Thank you all for dedicating time to analyzing Maker Talent\u2019s proposal. I believe that these discussions are necessary and healthy. I respect Frank\u2019s beliefs and I also think that a \u201ccommunication and implementation plan\u201d is something to include in every upcoming CUs strategy. So not only me but any new facilitator will benefit from this. On the other hand, I believe this comments are stuck in failures from the past, instead of analyzing the main proposal and the real problems that MakerDAO is facing today in terms of hiring/retaining contributors. The SES program is based on hiring the minimum structure needed to validate the business model of the CUs, and then, only after ratification, the FTE/PTEs are hired using the budget coming from the protocol. I recognized that, when I arrived, the already existing team was not executing properly, and as a consequence, I decided to try a new model: the new team was composed of one external headhunter for the complex tech profiles and an external HR consultant to help me strategizing the CU. By then, Veerle was not available full time and the budget we had was enough to hire her per project, but not full time. The Data problem. One of the biggest problems that we see here is that, when it comes to talent, we don\u2019t have any data. For that reason, all we have on the discussion table are likes and dislikes, impressions about people\u2019s competencies, but no real data insights that can take us to smart business decisions. In MakerDAO we didn\u2019t have any tools to measure and predict our workforce according to our plans. And this is the first problem that Maker Talent is trying to solve. The questions that I ask the community are:  Is MakerTalent roadmap identifying realistic problems of MakerDAO? Are these \u201cpriority one\u201d problems that are draining money and resources from the protocol? Are we proposing landed projects, with clear deadlines and metrics to solve those problems?  All of these answers are YES. What we are proposing today is something that nobody else is doing in other DAOs or Web3 environments. We are creating an operating model that empowers CUs so they can decide their talent priorities, acting as partners, helping them perform as independently as possible. Our plan consists of:  Tools to measure the success of people practices so we can be more efficient when forecasting our workforce needs (when we arrived, MakerDAO was not collecting any data on hiring, hence we were unable to properly forecast future hiring needs). An empowering strategy that DO observes the scientific results obtained from the X-Ray project (this allows us to only select the ones that are ready for the challenge of working for Maker, and improve our value proposal when hiring ). A compensation framework and a job evaluation system (at this moment, in MakerDAO facilitators do not have any source of reliable data to calibrate their internal budgets and job-offers according to the market and a comprehensive compensation plan). An offboarding system that is fast and efficient (the community identified this as a top priority and MakerTalent will be the owner and governance a major stakeholder). A fast and efficient onboarding system, so we can be better aligned and automate manual processes, that are also coordinated with the educational material that Maker Academy will be providing.  Finally, I believe that SES is doing an amazing job, and because they detected an opportunity to scale up better through Maker Talent (by having all the touchpoints indicated above) they hire me as a facilitator. I\u2019m really thankful to SES for choosing me as a facilitator. This is what I have been doing all my career in tech startups, what is my passion, what I love doing, and the reason why I accepted this challenge. As a sign of resilience and example for the colleagues that believe in me (and the facilitators that will come in the future), I will continue with this project and work on the communication and deployment plan to make sure that all the areas of concern are covered. I\u2019m happy to have another 240 minutes of conversation to get @elpro feedback on this plan. ",

I think this is also a good place for me to ask question regarding this:     manomad:  The questions that I ask the community are:  Is MakerTalent roadmap identifying realistic problems of MakerDAO? Are these \u201cpriority one\u201d problems that are draining money and resources from the protocol? Are we proposing landed projects, with clear deadlines and metrics to solve those problems?  All of these answers are YES.   So from what I understand, there are already Core Units that utilized Maker Talent Services. How was it? I did hear some were hired via them (correct me if I am wrong) but was it significantly better than how the team has been doing? Such feedbacks from Core Units would be helpful ",

                    "content": "@flipflopflapdelegate, @Artem_Gordon, @psychonaut , @Doo_StableLab I helped Maker with Recruiting, in an external capacity,  since 2017 and collaborated on and off on specific needs. In April of last year, when the team was in full-transition mode to the Core Unit Model, the team asked if I would like to join on a full-time basis. From my discussions with the SES, one could clearly realise that Maker had ambitious growth plans, considering more than 100+ hires per year (in 2022). We initially scoped about 20+ hires in May, last year. Talent Team Industry Practices Taking example from other teams, who have went through a high-growth period, most of these organisations have an army of people in their Talent Acquisitions practice, ranging from: - Head of People / HR: Responsible for the overall Recruiting and People Operations Strategy, and their abilities covered: recruiting, onboarding, employer branding, culture, performance and payroll) - Head of Talent: Responsible for strategy and operations of Talent Acquisitions, their responsibilities cover, assuring recruiting strategy and operations, building the team, owning the processes and documentation - Recruitment Project Manager: responsible for the overall job backlog, assuring communication between hiring teams and recruiters, assuring documentation, hiring plans, processes and communication channels - Recruiters: Responsible for day to day recruiting, both inbound / outbound, the OKRs, for a senior recruiter, are between 2-4 hires for month, and this depends on the complexity of the role and agility from interview to hire. - Recruiting Coordinators: Responsible for coordinating the entire process, their focus should be on improving efficiency from the 1st interview until the offer stage - Onboarding and Contributor Experience: This person should be responsible for the overall onboarding process and contributor experience. - Recruitment Marketing & Employer branding: Responsible for cultivating the Maker employer brand and driving the collaboration with a Maker CU that is responsible for Marketing & Comms. A senior Talent person could cover all the above, but the questions will be how to optimise workload and show efficiency. What should they focus on, what tradeoffs should they make? Should this person focus on setting the strategic direction first or assure day to day operations. Without the day to day operations covered, the Core Unit won\u2019t get any traction and visibility in front of Hiring Teams and other CUs. If we look at other Web3 organizations, that have went through a high-growth period, the teams from Chainlink and Protocol Labs have around 7-8 Senior Recruiters and about 4-6 Coordinators on their teams, in order to satisfy a growth rate of 100+ people per year. With Chainlink growing from 100 to 250 people last year, and Protocol Labs growing from 100+ to cca 300 people, by following the above model. Regarding forecasting: A talent team can forecast to a certain extent, but this only with the help and input provided by the other CUs when it comes to planning their growth ambitions. @monkey.irish  has been incredible at providing a clear plan for hiring within his CU from day 1, but throughout the past months many needs have been signalled impromptu, which makes it difficult to forecast what the talent CU should look like from a capability perspective. I\u2019ve created a job map for recruiting here (Miro | Online Whiteboard for Visual Collaboration ) when I first joined Maker in an in-house capacity, we have yet to finalise the onboarding and integration part.  What we would also need to stress in front of hiring managers and CU\u2019s is that hiring is a lengthy process, and in regular cases, the pipeline build stage, takes anywhere between 2-4 weeks, with that period extending for more complex roles. ( e.g. Lead Engineers, Solidity Engineers) My point is that, in order to successfully forecast, a talent team needs:  the capability to hold all stakeholder conversations clear objectives from hiring teams on their growth ambitions the experience and history to plan ahead for impromptu needs the right capabilities and talent team to do it in a timely and efficient manner  As Mariano, I was introduced to an already existing team, which is no longer at Maker. All new teams go through a series of stages, like Forming, Storming, Norming and Performing (Using the Stages of Team Development | MIT Human Resources).  With us, it did stop at the storming stage, but this is good example of how lack of a clear on-boarding plan can impact the success of a team. Doing a retrospective, we missed well defined R&R\u2019s, which lead to difficulties in making decisions and assigning our work. Also, a lack of clear ownership of the roles, led to being counter productive and focus more on solving disagreements rather than taking action. Hiring Costs Also, in order for a Talent CU, to become self-sustainable and rely less on the protocol to sustain its day to day operations, the other Core Units must realise that each hire comes with a cost, there is a cost per hire that each company occurs and this diverts to advertising, tooling and recruiting staff. IMO, as each Core Unit is an independent entity, they should be responsible for covering the cost per hire, which should be budgeted in the CU MIP, and not rely on the protocol and DAO to support this service. As each role is different, and each CU has different needs, the hiring cost will differ from role to role, and even simple things, like cost of advertising, will be difficult to forecast as prices for job boards differ and we need to use specific channels for specific roles. The Maker protocol, should only cover for the initial incubation of the Talent CU and perhaps cover some of the basic operational costs. This should also incentives the Talent CU to provide a better and more efficient service, as opting in for Talent Service is not going to be mandatory. I agree with @manomad\u2019s focus on a tactical plan and assuring day to day operations, until the CU is approved and properly staffed, the team will have little room for strategic initiatives. And unless the ecosystem realises this, it will run into similar problems with any Talent Facilitator. While the goal is to operate as lean as possible, I would like to stress the importance of setting the right expectations, having clear objectives, well defined service level agreements and having the necessary capabilities, within the team, in order to measure the performance of the Talent CU. Suggestion What I have proposed back then, and still consider as an ideal model to allow scaling up and down, depending on needs, is a portal/product that will allow Maker to interface with a network of recruiters via a bounty based model for each role. This will allow a Talent CU to focus on operations, processes  and contributor experience, without onboarding and hiring an army of recruiters, which will come with a high-overhead. This can also be combined with a Metaverse Hub, for Maker contributors, which will facilitate training, onboarding and getting up to speed on Maker in general. These are initiatives that take time and come with a certain costs, so while they can be included in a long term strategic plan, the CU\u2019s pain points in terms of hiring are immediate, and we also need to rely on a short-term tactical plan to satisfy current needs and get approval from the community.

Assuming full 8 members, this is 480k to 1120k per year which is actually less than the budget requested by the set up with 3 full time contributors for Talent Core Unit. Of course, this is just their salary so I assume they also had some for operation cost and etc. So in your view, is the current budget suggested by the Talent Core Unit reasonable? ",

We are, of course, respecting the MKR vote outcome and will reconsider the options within this new context. We wanted to restate some clarifications:  SES Incubation Program  Maker Principles The Incubation Program provides support and guidance to teams to scale and grow the Maker Ecosystem according to its core principles \u2013 permissionlessness, openness, and decentralization.  Independence The purpose of the incubation program is to scale up MakerDAO in a decentralized way. It has to produce Core Units that are independent, with facilitators who have the authority to make their own decisions and are accountable for those decisions. From About Y Combinator: We try to interfere as little as possible in the startups we fund. We don\u2019t take board seats or many of the other powers investors sometimes require. We offer lots of advice, but we can\u2019t force anyone to take it. We realize that independence is one of the reasons people want to start startups in the first place. And frankly, it\u2019s also one of the reasons startups succeed. Investors who try to control the companies they fund often end up destroying them.  Fairness The Incubation Program does not guarantee a positive outcome in the Governance vote. It will never replace the MKR holders as the ultimate decision-makers. Core Unit proposals from the SES Incubation Program are evaluated based on merit. All governance proposals should be assessed on an equal basis, whether they result from the SES incubation program or not.  The Facilitator One of the key learnings during the first batch was that incubated Core Units have a higher chance of success when a Facilitator has a strong vision, full ownership, and supports the values of decentralization. This person is likely:  a generalist within their field a self-starter with an entrepreneurship mindset great at navigating complex organizational systems  SES cannot dictate the candidates\u2019 decisions when developing the vision of their Core Unit. We can advise, and we can support. We can paint the red lines within which the facilitators must work to maintain their funding. But we cannot make decisions in their stead.  Improving the Incubation Program  V2 Launch for the new Context We have come a long way with the Incubation Program. What\u2019s more, MakerDAO is in a much stronger position than back then. Based on this and the feedback received during the first months, we are including several changes that should improve the program:  revamped content increased capacity sentiment polls with the Community  Read more about the v2 on this forum thread.  The Technical Aspects of the Incubation Program While it might help to know about the incubee\u2019s field of expertise to provide even better feedback, the support and guidance of the Incubator Program are mainly about everything else. As an example, the support provided to @dux-core-unit was not about the latest React library (or anything within their expertise). ",

I believe we need to take a clear break with the seemingly never ending TalentCU discussion about (outdated) centralized web2 operating models and tactical recruitment plans because that was not what the updated Talent CU MIPs was about. MakerDAO needs to become a more agile and accountable organization so they can more rapidly scale and adapt to the constant changes in the defi world. This will require us to design a more efficient and more collaborative way of working cross CUs, identifying duplications/inefficiencies, and clearly defining who will be accountable for what type of outcomes. This new way of working will give birth to new a type of CUs that will act as centers of expertise supporting the traditional CUs with researching, designing and deploying scalable and measurable solutions for a certain capability (e.g. Legal, Finance, Auditing, People, Marketing, Data Analytics, Communication, Social Impact) that doesn\u2019t make sense to be built within the traditional CUs or to be outsourced. One such Centers of Expertise will need to focus on the building agile and measurable people practices and solutions whereby the contributor experience concept will need to be core to the design itself given its competitive advantage in attracting and retaining talent. I therefore will put myself forward to be voted as a Facilitator to establish a Contributor Experience CU which will act as a center of expertise, researching, designing, and deploying scalable and measurable people practices and solutions for all touchpoints a contributor has with MakerDAO from entering to exiting (e.g., hiring, onboarding, OKRs, performance, compensation, learning, internal mobility). In line with the MakerDAO\u2019s core value of decentralization, this Contributor Experience CU will be a decentralized web3 operating model empowering contributors themselves to drive the agenda (challenges, needs, priorities) and define the contributor experience they expect from MakerDAO. CU facilitators will be empowered to autonomously attract and retain contributors and SES will be provided with much needed actionable data insights cross CUs. As part of this initiative, I will embark on listening to all stakeholder groups involved (CU Facilitators, Contributors, delegates, etc.), educating them about this type of agile and decentralized operating model (which is very different from traditional \u201cHR\u201d operating models) and reviewing the priorities and road map based on their input.
