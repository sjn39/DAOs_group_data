It was intended to use the IRV ranked voting option rather than the plurality option. Unfortunately with Labour day, it may not be fixed until tomorrow. Please hold-off on voting for the time being. Once I can coordinate with Foundation people, I\u2019ll have them remove the poll from the front-end and I\u2019ll replace it. Sorry for the inconvenience. I\u2019ll add an item to my checklist to double-check this option specifically in the future. Edit: New and correct poll is now live https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmnxitxuc5u4inynq8ekh5vvbgomjzl6fudwzhawbshhgh ",
