Ropsten, Ethereum\u2019s...       Peter on Rinkeby:   twitter.com    @  Rinkeby is too centralized around the Geth team and around me. It's too large to easily investigate, and it would get even more complex merged in with a beacon chain. I don't see transitioning it over to a community effort, nor do I think it's worth dragging that data with us.          ",

What are the blockers to redeploying this on another testnet? Would be curious to better understand and see if other projects are in the same situation. One note re: Rinkeby is that it won\u2019t be run through The Merge (or future forks), so as of The Merge, it won\u2019t be a good staging environment for mainnet. ",
