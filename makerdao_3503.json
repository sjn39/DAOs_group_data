The SC team has been working double duty to come up with patches and keep us on on track for Governance, the least we can do is hunker down, grit our team and push past these high gas prices. The safety of the protocol is of the upmost importance and these fixes can\u2019t go live until we push them through.  Voting to Say Thank You Moreover, this executive represents over a year of hard work from the SC team, designing a complete overhaul of our liquidations system to combat the events of another Black Thursday. In addition to thanking the all-stars working tirelessly on the protocol (and maybe agreeing to pay them as a core unit while you\u2019re at it) one great way to show your appreciation is to vote this executive through. Sure it would be nice to get a couple of whales to take care of this, but while we work on that, how about we send a message with voter participation and show how grateful we are to have such a strong team behind the protocol?  Motivating Memes If my words aren\u2019t enough  hope a few choice memes are     image1000\u00d71000 125 KB   Thanks Again SC Team   What do you say we get this passed today?

Perhaps if delegation comes on line but then who knows.    Given I might want to be a delegate (then again once I get into this I may not) it seems prudent.   I was looking at making a commentary on my own votes - to elaborate my choices - and then defend my reasoning for how I voted.  I started on this and after an hour of trying to set up a reasonable format and start commenting on the polls as well as the aspects of the Executive (there probably was 20+ things in there I could comment on) I gave up realizing it might take a good 1/2 a day just to do this one task.  For what exactly?   Some hope that it would be important and Maker \u2018some day in years\u2019 might determine is has value to compensate me in some minimal way.   All this thinking does is discourage - not encourage. My biggest problem here are entities that hold vast amounts of MKR that won\u2019t even communicate.  Heck we didn\u2019t even pass the letter to a16z.   I mean if entities that hold 10K\u2019s of MKR are not going to participate doesn\u2019t it behoove the remaining in the protocol to mint MKR and issue it to those who will?   Even if this is via a set of vesting type wallets. We still are piddling around with compensating key core contributors with MKR so they can actually secure and influence the system beyond the work they do.    Want to maybe get these players to vote well lets see them vote down some proposals to mint and distribute MKR to vesting contracts for our working/contributing people can put their actions into votes to secure and direct the system.   MKR gini coefficient I expects stinks.  What we really want to do is improve this - but to do it in direct response to participation. I wanted to take my BT compensation and buy another 13MKR when the price was low.  I got that compensation when after the price rose 4x.    so I could buy what 3MKR to get above 10.   It kinda hurt. I can\u2019t imagine all the other folks working for MKR being paid in DAI and holding no MKR.   @LongForWisdom  do you even have a single MKR for all the work you have done for the protocol? There are a lot of active people here who probably don\u2019t have hardly any MKR that really should\u2026 So while we can talk about MKR not voting or participating and try to \u2018whip\u2019 them into action.  Let\u2019s talk about the active people here with a pittance or no MKR that would love to have a real reason to continue participating and to have a real stake to secure and direct this system. ",

Ya, in retrospect I think we All wished we had bought more after the BT events\u2013but yes, the BT working group did have to wait quite a long time to be compensated.

And to be fair, lots of folks here like to learn, enjoy the Financial Nerdiness, and love the wisdom that folks like LongForWisdom and others bring to the table. I know I do\u2013I get a ton of knowledge which has help me create a bunch of opportunities that I am thankful for. And besides, a MKR Vote is a MKR Vote, whether you can only afford 0.00001 MKR, or if you\u2019re just being an active community member\u2013also, it does matter if your dream is to become the next Jay Powell, or Beyonce Knowles\u2013just as long as you know that everything around you that you call life\u2013was made by people that are no smarter than you.
