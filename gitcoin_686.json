                    "content": " Summary  This proposal looks to discuss and finalize how funding allocations for the Gitcoin Grants Round 13 Matching Pool are distributed. After previous successful Grants Rounds, this proposal aims to continue community-owned decision making regarding the structure of the main matching pool.  GR12 Matching Pool Results   Background  Prior to Grants Round 12, the pool was governed by categories that assigned specific percentages of the pool to grants in specific disciplines or geographies. In Grants Round 12, the community voted to run an experiment proposed by the Public Goods Funding workstream to test Vitalik\u2019s theory that Quadratic Funding should be as effective at allocating funds as allocation via categories. By doing away with specific grant categories and having all grants listed together, we took a step towards simplifying and decentralizing matching. See GR12 Matching Pool Allocations brief for more context.  Results  On the whole, the Public Goods Funding workstream believes the experiment was a success \u2013 directionally, at the very least. We believe the experiment was helpful in getting funding to more grants without complaints from top earners, and allowed us to test our assumptions about removing categories. Barring a small implementation error in the cap logic that was fixed mid-round, the matching cap operated as intended and resulted in a small number of high-funded grantees being capped off at the 2.5% threshold. All of this said, it is a subjective exercise to define what success of the matching cap looks like \u2013 success will depend on one\u2019s philosophical stance on the QF mechanism and how much, if at all, caps should be involved to achieve more democratic outcomes for the long-tail of grantees. With that out of the way, some information for you to interpret as you please: The numbers:*   In GR12, 10 of 758 grants (1.3% of grants) funded organically hit the matching cap of $25K   The total matching funds for these 10 grants represented 25% of the entire pool (10 grants x $25,000 = $250,000 on a $1M pool), and it would have been about 64% of the pool ($664,000) if we\u2019d had no cap   So, as a result of the cap, $414K (= $664K - $250K) was redistributed to the remaining 748 grantees, with each grantee receiving about 1.7x their otherwise expected match as a result of this cap   See also this great analysis by FDD contributor @kylin on matching cap results. *Note: These numbers are based on the preliminary round results as of Dec 16. They should be interpreted as directional, as they do not include removals after-the-fact by FDD. And some qualitative data points:   The Public Goods Funding workstream did not receive complaints about the cap amount from grantees or funders   In the GR12 finale event, Vitalik suggested the matching cap was a successful experiment, noting that \u201cin some ways, it might even be accelerating Gitcoin finding its product-market fit\u201d   Unfortunately, we do not have the ability to do a concrete \u2018what-if\u2019 analysis directly comparing the GR12 results under a matching cap structure versus categories, because the underlying metadata isn\u2019t there. Grants were no longer assigned a category as of GR12 \u2013 so without manually going in and assigning a category to each of the 1,000+ grants that came in after GR11, which we have not prioritized for obvious reasons, this analysis is not possible. So, with all of the information above \u2013 and the full GR12 results at your fingertips \u2013 we would love to hear from community members as to whether you agree that the cap was a success, and if & how we should continue with it in GR13. A statement from the PGF workstream: We don\u2019t know for sure yet if the main pool approach works best long-term, but we do know that there were major benefits for a longer tail of grantees and that it exceeded our expectations despite bugs, and we think it\u2019s worth trying again before we drastically change course.  GR13 Proposal  The Public Goods Funding workstream proposes that the structure of the round remains the same for GR13 at a high-level. In summary, the structure of the round will have:  A Main Pool Cause Rounds Ecosystem Rounds  Details on each:  Main Pool  The GR13 main pool will be a single matching pool fund/distribution of $1,200,000 in matching for the round. No individual grant\u2019s matching contribution amount shall exceed X% of the overall matching pool fund (i.e., $XK) \u2013 as voted on by the community (see options below).  Cause Rounds  In addition to the main pool, Gitcoin DAO will continue to leverage the multisig as a pass-through for cause rounds (aka thematic rounds), funded by external sponsors for clear sets of global public goods. As part of our work with Other Internet, we received a wide range of submissions about new types of public goods we should consider funding beyond just web3. In GR12, we experimented with rounds on climate, blockchain advocacy, and human longevity with net new funds. These cause rounds are a foray into Gitcoin moving beyond Digital Public Goods, and into Public Goods more broadly. By all accounts, these cause round experiments were successful first tests. We raised $1.7M in matching funds across the three causes (more than the main round matching pool!), and have continued to see meaningful interest here \u2013 both from our usual Web3 partners as well as from some Web2 donors \u2013 moving into GR13.  Ecosystem Rounds  Finally, the DAO will operate ecosystem rounds for groups like Uniswap and Polygon, as we have continued to do in the past. These are pass-through funds that are not drawn from the existing multisig balance.  Vote  The Public Goods Funding workstream has outlined three options on which we would like the community\u2019s input before moving to a Snapshot vote:  Option 1: Main Pool @ 2.5%  Stick to exactly what we did in GR12. No individual grant\u2019s matching contribution amount shall exceed 2.5% of the overall matching pool fund (i.e., $30K of the $1.2M pool).  Option 2: Main Pool @ Different Percentage  Stick to the GR12 structure, but with a new percentage. No individual grant\u2019s matching contribution amount shall exceed X% of the overall matching pool fund (i.e., $XK of the $1.2M pool). We would like to see community members perform their own analysis & propose percentages we might try in the comments on this post.  Option 3: Alternative Community-led Proposal  Gitcoin Stewards and the wider community decide on a new matching breakdown and propose such. This could include going back to categories, or something entirely new. We encourage any Steward or community member to submit their own matching pool breakdown if there are ideas! Please submit your proposal this week so that we have sufficient time to incorporate it into the vote!  Next Steps  Once we have feedback on both this and any other proposals, the Public Goods Funding workstream will gather all formal proposals and submit a Snapshot vote to decide which to move forward with. Please do not submit a snapshot vote for your proposal specifically! This just adds confusion and makes it harder for the community\u2019s voice to be heard effectively. ",

I like that more builders are benefiting with the cap in place, while the big projects are still doing very well. There are a few goals that are sometimes in tension here:  to support builders working for the open internet & the open economy\u2026 (more grants getting ~$5k/quarter) to allow the community to decide what projects are most deserving of matching funds (supports a less restrictive cap) to increase scale/impact of grants, which requires building awareness, comprehension & support for QF/grants as a credible mechanism for allocating funds (simpler is better)  To me, the 2.5% cap and this structure strikes approximately the right balance between these goals.

In particular:  I agree with @seanmac that it helps give a larger pool of builders the chance to raise sustainable funding; and that it helps us in turn scale the number of grantees that will be comfortable sticking around in following rounds without needing to scramble and look for funds elsewhere  The case for Option 1 specifically for me comes down to the fact that we aren\u2019t just funding public goods but running experiments in how these goods should be funded. To make sure we\u2019re getting all the data we need, we should at least try the same options a couple of times over to make sure there are no anomalies (unless it\u2019s immediately clear that the choices made were failures, which doesn\u2019t seem to be true for GR12). One thing I\u2019d eventually like to dive into deeper is how ecosystem rounds could effectively serve as a kind of replacement for independent categories, instead creating an overlapping mesh of different opportunities for grantees (e.g. we could imagine a project, like Dark Forest, that fits into a zktech round, an NFT round, and a gaming round). As @owocki has mentioned, QF can stack:  b606ff5a76790c5460a740cf9febb7a0826f5bd7_2_1380x8621380\u00d7862 52.8 KB  However, this progression is already happening naturally, and is fully compatible with Option 1. TL;DR: As always should be making sure we get the experiments we run right, and so pushing forward with Option 1 to measure twice / cut once would be my choice. ",

As a grant funder, they might have different funding priorities such as Polygon\u2019s focus areas when kickstarting their ecosystem round and designing a grant allocation mechanism that coordinates funding to these focus areas could become a new feature of ecosystem rounds too.

Sticking with the existing percentage (2.5%) seems totally reasonable. One thing we might anticipate, though, is that, as the total amount of matching funds goes up, we may wish to impose a hard-number limit as well. So perhaps, the cap becomes something like, \u201c2.5% with an absolute max of XX US dollars.\u201d In this way, as the amount of matching funds increases, more small projects would get more funding and the projects that are hitting the max are still doing very well (depending on XX). If a project is getting a couple of hundred thousand dollars per quarter (at some point in the future), I would argue that they should use some of those funds to hire a business consultant to figure out how to monetize. I much prefer a broad distribution than a concentrated one in the long run and 2.5% is totally arbitrary after all. ",

I appreciate the post and thoughtful nature of the options. I would advocate we hold the round at $1MM given the market turbulence and the increased funding in the cause rounds. This is mostly an intuition thing from many rounds before, but I figured I would flag that for thoughts.     annika:  Option 2: Main Pool @ Different Percentage   I was originally going to propose a smaller cap (1.5%) based on the work from Kylin, but Scott\u2019s thoughts below have left me conflicted. I like the idea of not changing too much too quickly. So I will hold on that being a formal reccomendation.     ceresstation:  To make sure we\u2019re getting all the data we need, we should at least try the same options a couple of times over to make sure there are no anomalies (unless it\u2019s immediately clear that the choices made were failures, which doesn\u2019t seem to be true for GR12).   One last thought - Gitcoin had been a beacon for funding when others were not offering funds. This enabled sustenance for many projects that have now grown immensely. I am continuing to think about we encourage new projects in the space to find their footing using a Gitcoin Grant, and to reward well established projects less and less. Something to consider on the product side, is to evaluate if longevity of a project is worth factoring in. ie, projects formed in the last 6 months have a cap of 2.5% projects over 6 months in tenure have a 2% cap and projects over a year old get 1.5%. This might help us bootstrap more projects and more innovation (though I recognize more ecosystems will fill this gap too). ",

Part of the reason this has been done is that each time we agree to raise the matching pool we actually move closer to our goals (across several workstreams) of scaling our impact, we shouldn\u2019t simply raise the pool to make things easier for ourselves here but we should also always err on the side of helping more grantees reach sustainability,   I do think it\u2019s important to figure out how to remain net zero on new funds each round, but in this upcoming round we\u2019ll be receiving approximately $1.5m in total funds from matching partners in addition to the $4m in AKITA, so I think $1.2m would be a small increase relative to new funds, if net inflows were lower (despite the macro market) I\u2019d be more inclined to hold back.

I echo @ceresstation\u2019s points - and will add that with how main pool contributions are coming in so far, we\u2019re going to end up with a large majority of that $1.2M being net new funds earmarked specifically for GR13, which makes me feel good about the $1.2M route. At a more macro level on round size, IMO we should find ways to be more scientific / less subjective about this for future rounds. Principally, I agree with @ceresstation that we should strive to be net zero on new funds each round. Given that we often get new contributions after this proposal is finalized, I wonder if we might shift to having the matching pool size ratified alongside payouts post-round, rather than pre-round with the allocations. On project longevity as an input to cap amount: I love this thought - given that a lot of the ethos of grants is around getting new projects off the ground, I agree that testing creative structures like this might better bootstrap early-stage innovation. Let\u2019s explore this as we plan GR14! I\u2019ll loop product in on the concept. ",

The aim of introducing the cap is to prevent a few grants from dominating the matching pool and letting the rest get more funds. It seems to me that the vision of the re-distribution is not clearly stated. It would be good if we can set specific goals that we want to achieve by introducing the cap, like:  ~$5000 is generally enough for a grant in the short term. We want to see at least the top 5% grant could hit this amount. we aim to let half of the grants get at least $500 to help their development.  With some explicit criteria like these, it will be easier to determine what percentage is optimal. I am very happy to work on this if more specific goals can be available. An alternative way perhaps is to let the owners of grants set up caps for themselves before a round starts - a sensible short-term amount that they will need between the current and next round. Once a grant hits its pre-specified cap,  the excess funds will be re-distributed. The advantage of doing this is each grant can have a separate cap rather than a fixed one. It seems more reasonable that projects of different scales/stages/difficulties would have different levels of caps? @DisruptionJoe ",

Something I said in the previous round and I would like to revisit and saw also others suggested is to make the system a bit more modular. In essence allow grant owners to specify how much they and their team needs for a given quarter and once that is reached that is the cap for the round. There should probably be another cap on top which should be the max they can get but I think this would optimize the rounds (assuming most grant owners are honest). ",

I also support @tjayrush\u2019s addition to add a max amount to this cap, but maybe this is only necessary at a later stage - could be good to have two identical rounds in setup to compare data, as Scott suggests.

With regard to the categories I think it\u2019s important to keep on having these clearly on the site for easy navigation (even still a lot to improve here), having all funds into one category (excl side and ecosystem rounds) makes total sense. The distinction between funding categories & thematic categories should be further clarified (although not an immediate solution there, I think it\u2019s a lot for non gitcoin people - and even gitcoin people - to wrap their heads around), good thoughts by @ceresstation on this above.

For instance, my Cheerbot project has been early-stage simmering for a bit, waiting for Web3 to get more involved in the Maker and IRL space. This finally seems to be happening if ETHDenver2022 is any indication! The more likely a project will make a big difference, because it\u2019s a major innovation or paradigm shift, the more likely it\u2019ll take time for that project to find the right moment of opportunity as the market catches up. I hope we don\u2019t accidentally penalize forward thinking projects that pick patience out of prudence with a one-size-fits-all longevity cap. ",

Further, there may be a threshold that needs to be reached before any funding is given (ideally from individuals as well). For example, I post a project of something I am planning to do, but only commit to this idea if I can get $500 in funding. If I dont raise this amount, I will not move forward and the funds I did receive should be returned. ",
