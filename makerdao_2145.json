Paragraph Summary MIP111 establishes the Infrastructure Scope Framework. This includes Keepers, infrastructure tools, Maker Teleport, Oracle needs for Maker Core and Oracle standards for SubDAOs, and other infrastructure related topics. All rules for Infrastructure for the DAO are contained in this framework, including the procedures of the Infrastructure Scope Framework Advisory Council.  Component Summary MIP111c1: Preamble Contains the Preamble to the Infrastructure Scope Framework. MIP111c2: Scope Framework Articles Contains the Scope Framework Articles for the Infrastructure Scope Framework. MIP111c3: Responsible Facilitators Contains details on the Responsible Facilitators for the Infrastructure Scope Framework. MIP111c4: Scope Framework Articles Modification Subproposal Process Contains details of how the Infrastructure Scope Framework can be amended.  Motivation The Infrastructure Scope Framework is necessary to define the Scope as per the Maker Constitution.  Specification  MIP111c1: Preamble The Infrastructure Scope Framework covers Keepers, infrastructure tools, Maker Teleport, Oracle needs for Maker Core and Oracle standards for SubDAOs, and other infrastructure related topics.  MIP111c2: Scope Framework Articles  1: The Infrastructure Advisory Council  1.1: The Infrastructure Advisory Council definition The Infrastructure Advisory Council is a group of Infrastructure Actors that have been approved by Maker Governance to carry out advisory work related to improving the content of the Infrastructure Scope Framework.  1.2: Infrastructure Advisory Council membership management Members of the Advisory Council are directly approved by Maker Governance through a governance poll, and must fulfill specific criteria.   1.2.1: The Responsible Facilitators must ensure that potential Advisory Council Members can apply to be approved by Maker Governance, using an open process with clear instructions.     1.2.2: Advisory Council Members must be Infrastructure actors that are not involved in any business activity that could result in a conflict of interest, either directly or indirectly. They must also have relevant skills for providing professional expert input on the content that the Infrastructure Scope is covering.     1.2.3: The Responsible Facilitators must periodically, when it is relevant, review the Advisory Council Applications, and if they find applications that are suitable, bring them to a vote through an MKR governance poll. Approved Advisory Council Members are added to 10.2.3.1:.     1.2.4: The Responsible Facilitators may, if they deem it necessary, hold a vote to remove an Advisory Council Member. If an Advisory Council Member has not done any paid work for the Scope for at least 1 year, then the Responsible Facilitators can choose to remove them at will, if they deem it necessary.     1.2.5: The current approved Advisory Council Members are recorded in the soft element 1.2.5.1.  1.2.5.1:  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 Current list of Advisory Council Members: * N/A \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4    1.3: Infrastructure Advisory Council projects and funding The Advisory Council is paid on a project basis to do specific work that improves all or specific parts of the Scope Framework.   1.3.1: Each Quarter, if they deem it necessary, the Responsible Facilitators must solicit proposals and find one or more suitable Advisory Council Members to perform a project that will result in output that can be used to improve the Scope Framework. This work output will be presented to the CVC Subcommittee Meetings as the starting point for the CVC Scope Framework Position Documents. As many CVCs as possible should be supported this way, prioritized by the Responsible Facilitators.     1.3.2: In case an ambiguous, uncertain or challenging situation arises related to the Scope Framework, the Responsible Facilitator may approach one or more Advisory Council Members to perform a reactive project that aims to specify the language of the Scope Framework to take into account the specific situation. The Responsible Facilitator can then directly propose the change to the Scope Framework in a weekly governance poll, quickly resolving the challenge.     1.3.3: The Advisory Council may not produce work output that is directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Framework. In this case the Responsible Facilitator must either transcribe it themselves, or hire an Ecosystem Actor to perform the transcription. This role does not require preapproval by Maker Governance.     1.3.4: The Responsible Facilitators may also produce advisory input on the content of the Scope Framework themselves, as long as it is focused on improving process and governance content. They are prohibited from providing unilateral input on expert subject matter content.     1.3.5: The Responsible Facilitators have a budget available to pay for Advisory Council Projects per quarter. All spending must be limited to only what is deemed necessary and with a high probability of producing clearly measurable value, and this must be transparently be accounted for in a forum post at least a week before any transaction occurs.  1.3.5.1:  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 The Advisory Council project budget is as follows:     Quarterly Budget (DAI) Method of Distribution Maximum Limit (DAI)     0 Keg - streamed at a linear rate over 3 months 0     \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4    2: The Implementation of the Infrastructure Scope Framework through Software The Responsible Facilitators must in collaboration with the CVC Subcommittees, periodically review possibilities of integrating DAO toolkit innovation into the processes and content of the Scope Framework.  MIP111c3: Responsible Facilitators The Responsible Facilitators of the Infrastructure Scope Framework are defined in MIP113c2.6.1.2.1A.  MIP111c4: Scope Framework Articles modification Sub Proposal process During the Pregame the Scope Framework articles can be modified through the Monthly Governance Cycle using a MIP102c2 subproposal.
