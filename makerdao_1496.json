MIP79: Recognized Delegate MKR Compensation.  It is recommended that all three MIPs are read to understand the totality of the changes being proposed.  References   Delegate platform template. Contract Verification Instructions #1 Contract Verification Instructions #2   Sentence Summary MIP77 provides a base definition of the role of delegates within the Maker Protocol. In addition, it delineates the distinction between a Shadow Delegate and a Recognized Delegate.  Paragraph Summary MIP77 provides a base definition of the role of delegates within the Maker Protocol. In addition, it delineates the key distinctions between a Shadow Delegate and a Recognized Delegate. MIP77 outlines how any individual or group may become a Recognized Delegate and the metrics used to monitor Recognized Delegates. MIP77 acts as a foundation for further iteration on the role of Recognized Delegates as the Maker Protocol matures.  Component Summary MIP77c1: Definitions MIP77c1 defines key terms relating to delegation. MIP77c2: Becoming a Recognized Delegate MIP77c2 outlines how a delegate may become a Recognized Delegate. MIP77c3: Recognized Delegate Code of Conduct MIP77c3 specifies the Recognized Delegate Code of Conduct. MIP77c4: Recognized Delegate Roles and Responsibilities MIP77c4 defines the base roles and responsibilities of Recognized Delegates within the Maker Protocol. MIP77c5: Recognized Delegate Metrics MIP77c5 defines the relevant metrics that the Governance Facilitators will use to monitor the activity of Recognized Delegates. MIP77c6: Recognized Delegate Metric Reset MIP77c6 describes the process for a Recognized Delegate to reset the metrics displayed on the voting portal. MIP77c7: Recognized Delegate Resignation MIP77c7 lays out the steps for a Recognized Delegate to resign.  Motivation MIP77 provides a baseline definition of the Recognized Delegate role within the Maker Protocol. However, by design, it does not fully encompass all the roles and responsibilities that a Recognized Delegate may wish to undertake. Instead, it is preferred to leave the majority of this interpretation to the Recognized Delegates themselves to provide a rich and diverse array of delegates from which MKR holders may select their chosen representative(s) for their delegated MKR. Nevertheless, setting some fundamental roles and responsibilities to align expectations between the Maker Community, MKR holders, Core Units, and Recognized Delegates is crucial. MIP77 acts as a foundational MIP upon which additional MIPs may interface to further iterate upon the Recognized Delegate role. This includes mooted proposals such as Executive Delegates and Specialized Delegates, which should use this framework to develop the system further.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP77c1: Definitions Delegate: Any individual or group that has ownership of a delegate contract. Delegator: Any MKR holder that has delegated MKR token voting power to a delegate. Delegate Contract: A smart contract that can be created permissionlessly to allow MKR holders to delegate the voting power of their tokens to the contract owner, the delegate. The delegate can only use these tokens to vote; they cannot be transferred. This means they cannot be used to trigger Emergency Shutdown via the Emergency Shutdown Module. Recognized Delegate: Any delegate that meets the criteria defined in MIP77c2, as determined by a majority of Governance Facilitators. These delegates may associate a name with their delegate contract and will be listed prominently in the UI. The following are some of the benefits of becoming a Recognized Delegate in the Maker Protocol:  Recognized Delegates are listed prominently on the voting portal compared to Shadow Delegates. A prominent listing on the voting portal provides an advantage over shadow delegates to Recognized Delegates when competing for delegators. Recognized Delegates are eligible for DAI and MKR compensation from the Maker Protocol under MIP78 and MIP79. Becoming a Recognized Delegate carries prestige as a prominent community member and a greater ability to influence DAO activity and proceedings to align with the aims and ambitions of the Recognized Delegate.  Shadow Delegate: Any delegate that does not meet the requirements to become a Recognized Delegate. These delegates may not associate a name with their delegate contract but will still be listed in the UI.  MIP77c2: Becoming a Recognized Delegate The followings steps must be undertaken by any delegate wishing to become a Recognized Delegate in the Maker Protocol, although they need not be completed in this specific order:   Inform a Governance Facilitator of the intention to become a Recognized Delegate.  Read and sign-up for the Delegates Code of Conduct. The canonical Code of Conduct is defined in MIP77c3. The sign-up method is left at the discretion of the delegate. Some options include:  Signing a message on-chain. Confirming that they have read and agreed to it within their Recognized Delegate Platform post (see step 3). Upload a copy of the Code of Conduct to a content-addressed distributed file system with a statement saying they have agreed to it. For example, IPFS or Swarm.    Fill in and post a Recognized Delegate Platform to the delegates category of the MakerDAO forum. The Recognized Delegate Platform is a chance for delegates to lay out what they stand for as a delegate within MakerDAO. It is the lens through which MKR Holders will see Recognized Delegates and their actions. Deviation from the template is acceptable, but delegates should try to cover everything in the template. Contact details and Conflict of Interest disclosures are mandatory. The sections that can be ignored are marked as \u201coptional\u201d.  Participate in a \u2018Meet Your Delegate Meeting\u2019. The Governance Facilitators will schedule this in collaboration with prospective Recognized Delegates and will host and manage the meeting recording. The Governance Facilitators will arrange for the meeting recording to be uploaded to the MakerDAO YouTube channel. The Governance Facilitators can arrange to remove the recording in the future if the participant wishes to cease being a Recognized Delegate (see MIP77c7). There is no requirement for a prospective Recognized Delegate to appear on camera, but audio is required. The general format of these meetings is as follows:  30 minutes total duration. 5-10 minutes presentation by the delegate highlighting their platform, relevant background, and what they feel they can offer as a MakerDAO Recognized Delegate. The remaining time will be used for a Question and Answer session for members of the Maker Community to ask questions of the delegate.    Set up a delegate contract using the voting portal UI here. It is recommended that delegates verify the contract on etherscan (instructions here and here).  Add Recognized Delegate details to GitHub. A Pull Request should be made to the MakerDAO Community Github repo. The Pull Request should include updated versions of the template files that can be found here. The addition of an avatar is not required but is recommended. These files should be copied to a new folder whose name matches the delegate contract address. The Governance Facilitators can arrange assistance with this step if required.   MIP77c3: Recognized Delegate Code of Conduct  Good Faith Recognized Delegates should always act with honesty, integrity, and transparency.  Best Interest Recognized Delegates should operate and vote in what they believe is in the best interests of the Maker Protocol.  Due Care and Attention Recognized Delegates should make a professional and unbiased review of each proposal before submitting their vote.  Communication Recognized Delegates should ensure that they communicate the rationale behind each of their votes in a clear and accessible way.  Professional Knowledge Recognized Delegates should maintain a working knowledge of developments at Maker and in the wider cryptocurrency space.  Conflicts of Interest Recognized Delegates should avoid conflicts of interest and mitigate their impact when not possible. Disclose in writing any conflicts of interest. Publicize any offer of external compensation related to delegation or the Maker Protocol.  Availability Recognized Delegates should \u2014within reason\u2014 be accessible to the community to answer questions, respond to comments, and discuss issues.  MIP77c4: Roles and Responsibilities of Recognized Delegates The role of a Recognized Delegate can be expressed in two parts:  To express opinion in on-chain Governance processes by casting regular votes. To communicate their voting decisions and the rationale behind them.  Recognized Delegates expressing their opinion by voting is essential to the Governance process at MakerDAO, particularly regarding Executive Votes, as these execute the technical changes required for the operation of the Maker Protocol. By expecting Recognized Delegates to communicate their votes, we can ensure that there is sufficient transparency to allow delegators to evaluate whether their chosen Recognized Delegate is acting in their and the Maker Protocol\u2019s best interests. It also provides valuable feedback to proposal authors. If a proposal is unsuccessful, this feedback is crucial and may allow a refined proposal to pass the Governance process. Beyond this, Recognized Delegates may take on additional roles and responsibilities as they see fit. Examples might include:  Authoring Governance proposals. Evaluating Proposals in the pre-polling stage on the MakerDAO forum. Participating in calls and discussions centred on issues related to MakerDAO.  Future MIPs that build upon the Recognized Delegate framework may require that Recognized Delegates take on additional roles and responsibilities \u2014 but these two responsibilities should remain intact.  MIP77c5: Recognized Delegate Metrics  Participation Metric The participation metric is a percentage of all on-chain polls and executive proposals a delegate has voted on. For this metric, \u201cAbstain\u201d is a valid vote. Executive Votes and polls are tracked separately and also as a combined value. For example, a score of 100% would mean that a Delegate has voted in all possible polls and Executive Votes since they started their role as a Recognized Delegate. It is expected that Recognized Delegates vote on Executive Proposals, or voice their explicit opposition, within 72 hours of them being posted to the voting portal. Due to the security and operational issues surrounding Executive Votes, these votes are weighted by a factor of five when calculating the participation metric. Failing to vote on an Executive Vote may occur in an emergency or when a Recognized Delegate disagrees fundamentally with the contents. Failing to vote for an Executive Vote does not count against Recognized Delegates for participation tracking if they can provide sound reasoning for their abstention, as assessed by the Governance Facilitators. The outcome of an Executive Vote will have no bearing on participation tracking for that Executive Vote. However, the Governance Facilitators strongly recommend that Recognized Delegates and delegators consider the security and operational risks that opposing an Executive Vote poses to the Maker Protocol.  Communication Metric The communication metric is  expressed as a percentage and contains two components:  Has the Recognized Delegate communicated how they voted on a proposal? Has the Recognized Delegate given a rationale for the voting decision?  Recognized Delegates are rewarded with a higher score for providing the reasoning behind their voting decisions. For example, if a Recognized Delegate communicates a vote without reasoning, they receive a score of 50% for that vote. On the other hand, if they communicate their vote with reasoning, they receive a score of 100%. An overall score is calculated by taking the mean average for all votes. For example, a score of 100% would mean a Recognized Delegate communicated all of their voting decisions AND gave reasons for reaching these decisions. On the other hand, a score of 50% would indicate that a Recognized Delegate conveyed their choices but did not provide any reasoning for these decisions. A score of 75% might suggest a Recognized Delegate had communicated reasoning approximately half of the time but always communicated how they voted. Due to the security and operational issues surrounding Executive Votes, these votes are weighted by a factor of five when calculating the communication metric. Recognized Delegates are expected to communicate their vote within seven days of a Governance Poll concluding, or from the execution of an Executive Vote. The exception to this is when a Recognized Delegate is opposing an Executive Vote (see the discussion above regarding the participation metric). The assessment of reasoning for any given vote is subjective. Governance Facilitators have the final say on whether the provided reasoning is sufficient.  Metric Tracking The Governance Facilitators are responsible for tracking the communication and participation metrics and for ensuring their accuracy. If a Recognized Delegate has a query regarding their metrics, they should contact a Governance Facilitator. Metrics will be displayed on the delegate cards on the voting portal with a further breakdown on each Recognized Delegate\u2019s profile. The Governance Facilitators should aim to do this weekly, where possible. The calculated metrics will be:  The metrics for the last twelve months \u2014 these will be the primary metrics displayed in the UI. The metrics for the total duration of time a Recognized Delegate has been active. The metrics for the last three months \u2014 these will be used to calculate Recognized Delegate DAI compensation (see MIP78) and by extension MKR Vesting (see MIP79).  When a Recognized Delegate moves to a new delegate contract due to their previous one expiring, their metrics will be ported over with their Recognized Delegate profile.  MIP77c6: Recognized Delegate Metric Reset Recognized Delegate metrics will only apply to the most recent 12-month period. However, there are reasons why a Recognized Delegate\u2019s ability to perform the role may temporarily be disrupted. Examples of valid reasons could include technical issues, accidents, illness, family leave, or vacation. Similarly, a Recognized Delegate\u2019s personal circumstances may change allowing them to devote more time to their role as a Recognized Delegate. In this instance, a Recognized Delegate may request to reset their tracked metrics. Such a request should be approved by a majority of Governance Facilitators. Recognized Delegates should post requests to reset metrics and the reasoning for the request to the MakerDAO forum and notify a Governance Facilitator. This can only be done once every twelve months to prevent system abuse. A Recognized Delegate may choose any date within the last three months as a new start date for their metric tracking \u2014 this is useful if a Recognized Delegate wishes to demonstrate a renewed commitment to participating and communicating their votes prior to requesting a metric reset. Once a request has been made and approved by the Governance Facilitators, the Governance Facilitators will reset the metrics displayed in the UI. This also applies to the three-month metrics used for Delegate Compensation. An indication that a Recognized Delegate has reset their metrics will be displayed in the UI. Upon ratification of this MIP all Recognized Delegates will have the option to reset their metrics, regardless of how long they have been active.  MIP77c7: Recognized Delegate Resignation If a Recognized Delegate wishes to step down from their role, they should take steps to ensure that their delegators are informed. At a minimum, this should include a post in their Delegate Platform thread. The Governance Facilitators recommend that one month\u2019s notice is appropriate. The Governance Facilitators will organize the removal of the Recognized Delegate from the UI, once they have been informed of their resignation. ",

If the DAO decides to turn Recognized Delegates into a \u201cmanagement council\u201d or a \u201cboard of directors\u201d, it will corrupt the entire governance process. Delegates represent their delegators and their unique POV. They do not represent the entire DAO nor do they represent all MKR holders. Delegates should never be forced or expected to reach off-chain consensus as a final destination. On-chain governance is there for a reason - delegates and MKR holders are expected to disagree on DAO issues and those disagreements can only be settled by an official vote. Turning RDs into a committee that makes off-chain decisions in a subjective manner is subverting the entire idea of decentralized governance and turning the DAO into a \u201cfirm\u201d or a \u201ccompany\u201d. Recognized Delegates are independent people or organizations who have stepped up to represent the interests of MKR holders who choose to delegate to them. That is the extent of what RDs are.

Aren\u2019t RDs incentivized to remain formally active in the system   As @ultraschuppi says, this is about ensuring that the life-cycle of an RD is accounted for. Obviously, an RD can choose to ignore this, and there isn\u2019t much we can do. But the incentives will drop off rather rapidly anyway if we transition to a three-month view of metrics, so the social cost of doing so may outweigh the financial benefit.     pvl:  Maybe the term \u201cdelegate\u201d is no longer adequate for the role? Not sure what the replacement should be, but do you guys think about looking for one?   We didn\u2019t discuss changing the name internally. I think the terms delegate, shadow delegate and recognized delegate accurately convey that the influence these individuals possess has been delegated by MKR holders, whereas something like council or board introduces an element of complexity to the casual observer.     MakerMan:  I would expect compensation to run till end of term   Yep, agree with this.

I will think about the best way to word it and then add something in.     MakerMan:  Also I would think some sort of fire-drill tests for performance measures of response to such emergencies should be undertaken IF important to the protocol.   My view of fire drills is that they are a good example of what is meant in the MIP by:     Patrick_J:  MIP77 acts as a foundational MIP upon which additional MIPs may interface to further iterate upon the Recognized Delegate role.   If we want to continue fire drills going forward, we should have a MIP that defines fire drills and their use in the Maker Protocol, and that MIP should reference MIP77 and the expectations of Recognized Delegates in the fire drill process.     ultraschuppi:  How is missing executives (or not communicating why no support is given) being weighted against polls? Same weight?   Under MIP61 and the current proposal, executives and polls have the same weight.

I think this is an important aspect and should be included in pay, especially if delegates are responsible for high amounts of voting power. Maybe this could be startified: If a delegate is representing more than 5000 MKR due response to fire drills is a necessity for receiving compensation. Fire drills should require less than 48hrs till responding. This is below the security window and would reflect the real world.     teemulau:  We are probably voting abstain to any polls relating to MIP77 - 79.

                    "content": "To be fair, this is a classic problem in Judgement and Decision Making research (JDM). If we use the Dual Systems theoretical model popularized by Kahneman and Tversky, we can make some reasonable predictions using the theory of situated cognition. People prefer to reason intuitively as it reduces energy expenditure. People will only apply effort and reason systematically when a decision is of high consequence (which college to go to) or of personal relevance (which car to buy). You can also guide people to use either system with incidental cues (i.e. Processing Fluency). That being said, people will use heuristics as their primary inputs for making decisions. What you are describing is in essence is changing the heuristic. Rather than look at \u201cgut feeling\u201d they will look at the KPIs. This may or may not be a better heuristic, but we hope it would be. Having KPIs does not ensure one will effortfully reason regarding a judgment. To make your point even more clear. In the absence of data or the ability to reason, individuals can only use heuristics and will substitute the data input to make a judgement (e.g. how much do I like the facilitator?). The long and short of it is that governance UX is not an easy problem to solve. You need to provide the right information and the right incentives to produce good judgements. KPIs sourced bottom up are unlikely to solve our issues of strategic alignment, but it is likely to cost a significant amount of energy. It seems the best time to engage in this activity may be after there is some agreement regarding the general vision and strategy for Maker. If we approach it in this way, KPIs can be matched bottom up to the high level objectives. This approach would require us to focus on aligning the DVCs first. ",

Given that fire drills will likely take place no more frequently than quarterly, I think it is reasonable to wait until this MIP set is ratified before adding a MIP specifically for fire drills.     rspa:  If a delegate is representing more than 5000 MKR due response to fire drills is a necessity for receiving compensation. Fire drills should require less than 48hrs till responding. This is below the security window and would reflect the real world.   Interesting approach.
