Who\u2019s in? Follow on: The biggest hurdle I see (at present) is the fact that a lot of these projects are running into sadness with griefing whereby they need to deploy contracts for an adjudication process. I think we can mitigate these deployments through raising the cost of griefing through an additional bond in each channel - the implementation details of this being left up to the implementer. ",

We don\u2019t need \u201copen standards\u201d that aren\u2019t informed by real world usage, because then we\u2019re just speculating about the real world usage. The risk that we\u2019ll have to change something is high, and the cost of collaboration along the way is also high, meaning prioritizing forming a ring around this would actually only serve to slow everyone down for no reason. Much more immediately important is putting channels in front of real users and seeing what sticks. If you actually care about pushing this forward, work full-time alongside Connext, Kyokan, and SpankChain as we upgrade our production payment channel hubs, or with one of the other teams close to shipping a production channel implementation. It\u2019s not as sexy as \u201cbringing everyone together\u201d, but making progress isn\u2019t always sexy. [Edit] Actually in this specific case, making progress on SpankChain\u2019s tech might actually be sexier  ",

I agree about getting things done, and we can get things done while not going down a path where we get to a \u2018best viewed in Internet explorer\u2019 world.
