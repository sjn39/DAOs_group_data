Notwithstanding having previously completed KYC/AML review for RWA Foundation and having completed a first DAI-USD conversion for RWA Foundation on Thursday, August 4, 2022, Genesis Global Trading, Inc. (GGT) has now determined that it is unable to undertake DAI-US Dollar conversions for RWA Foundation. As a consequence, the 25 million DAI transmitted to GGT on Saturday, August 6, 2022 will need to be returned to RWA Urn. This will require the MKR token holders to approve a change of the wallet address in the RWA Foundation portal with GGT from RWA Jar to RWA Urn. The following is the Executive text: If this Executive Proposal is passed The MKR token holders authorize The Director of RWA Foundation to instruct Ankura Trust Company, LLC to update the RWA Foundation portal with Genesis Global Trading Inc. by replacing 0x6C6d4Be2223B5d202263515351034861dD9aFdb6 with 0x1818EE501cd28e01E058E7C283E178E9e04a1e79 The Director of RWA Foundation to instruct Genesis Global Trading Inc. to return 25 million DAI to 0x1818EE501cd28e01E058E7C283E178E9e04a1e79 The Director of RWA Foundation to take such steps as are necessary to give effect to the above Ankura Trust Company, LLC to update the RWA Foundation portal with Genesis Global Trading Inc. to reflect the above changes to the RWA Foundation portal with Genesis Global Trading Inc.

Unfortunately, At Genesis it is only possible to hard code one destination address for sending DAI back to Maker. So it was initially set to reflect until termination of the Master Participation Agreement that all DAI sent to MD reflected fee and other income. Upon termination of the MPT, governance needs to issue an instruction to have all capital/principal repaid to the RWAUrn at which time the DAI debt in the urn can be wiped. Where ever we can we try to minimize manual steps - however this was deemed as necessary to enhance the security of the Real World Structure and ensure strict control for changing of wallet addresses.
