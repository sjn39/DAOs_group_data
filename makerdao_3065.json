I have firsthand evidence that there is an attempt to take over the protocol.  The recent price depression of MKR is no coincidence.  It is an orchestrated attack, by DeFi\u2019s greatest villain, DegenSpartan.  Please see our private exchange below.  I\u2019ve written about it as part of my investigative reporting: here  Takeover632\u00d7802 151 KB  I believe it is time to expose his villainous acts and restore the price of MKR to it\u2019s rightful place. Godspeed, Uncle ",

I think there are some other factors at play in the current market price, and this is giving far too much credit to DegenSpartan, but everyone should understand that whoever controls the MKR controls the protocol, that is not a secret. Everyone has the same opportunity to buy as DS, and if an anon twitter shitposter gets control of the protocol, then those are the rules of the game. There\u2019s always Emergency Shutdown and global settlement if other majority holders don\u2019t like it. ",
