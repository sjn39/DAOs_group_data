It would be nice if DApps instead contained all their functionality (including user interface) on-chain. This ERC would provide a framework to create a set of components (like navbars, modals, forms, and links, which would be standardized in a subsequent ERC) that would allow for a wide variety of user-interfaces. This ERC would also provide a mechanism for DApps to request to create their own components. With ERC-4834 - Hierarchical Domains Standard by Pandapip1 \u00b7 Pull Request #4835 \u00b7 ethereum/EIPs \u00b7 GitHub, the DApp\u2019s contract address could be resolved with a human-readable name. This would mean that interacting with fully on-chain DApps wouldn\u2019t be significantly different than using a web browser, except that the applications are now fully on-chain, and accessibility is improved due to the fact that all websites now use a common set of components (which could potentially be customized by the user).
