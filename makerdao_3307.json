Overview Gas prices are getting higher and higher. The rapid growth of Binance\u2019s BSC is showing us that, while perhaps not the final answer, sidechains will play an important role in the next few months. xDai (official website: https://www.xdaichain.com/) is an Ethereum sidechain with dPoS (delegated proof of stake) mechanism. It is one of the most promising scaling solutions that works today. It is a direct competitor of BSC and it is interesting to us because:  it is more decentralised (in fact I will propose another time that MakerDAO could run a Validator on xDAI) gas is paid in xDAI (1:1 backed by DAI), and so the success of xDAI seems to be linked to that of DAI (and so of MakerDAO).  The Problem Currently the xDAI chain holds ~40m usd worth of assets that have been bridged from Ethereum mainnet (this includes more than 7m DAI). Source: xDai (xDAI) Explorer This number is growing quickly (it was ~22m about 10 days ago) but is still low. What is needed are more Liquidity providers moving their assets to xDAI. For example, in the following screenshot, you see how horrible the MKR/xDAI pair is on Honeswap (https://honeyswap.org/), an Uniswap clone running on xDAI: Screenshot 2021-02-22 at 16.47.49892\u00d71372 103 KB Proposal. I propose to:  mint (or buy in the market) a number N (example N=1000) of MKR. take a corresponding amount of DAI from the SB (now (~2.2k * N)  DAI) Act as LP on Honeyswap on the MKR/DAI pair.  Technically, this will be done manually using the mandated actor multisig to buy MKR and add liquidity on Honeswap: xDAI accounts use the same private keys as in Ethereum, furthermore Gnosis multisig is compatible with xDAI (see source: here). This would be done gradually (to manage risks with usage of the xDAI platform) over the course of a few weeks. The expected result is:  help/boost the growth of xDAI make MKR one of the most liquid tokens on this network.  (see https://info.honeyswap.org/ for an overview of statistics on Honeyswap).    How many MKR do you want to bring to xDAI for LP?  50 MKR 100 MKR 200 MKR 500 MKR 750 MKR 1000 MKR 1200 MKR 0 - I don\u2019t want to do that. Abstain     0 voters     ",

So it\u2019s not really the same as inflating the MKR supply by 1200 all at once. It\u2019s more like the system sells off a bit of MKR when the price rises, and buys back a bit of MKR when the price falls (the amount is equal to the impermanent loss in the pool). I see this as a way to bootstrap some TVL in a sidechain that is more amenable to decentralization than the other one, improve MKR liquidity, and earn some small trading fees for the protocol. ",

It is a balance sheet manipulation (assuming the AMM code is safe, of course, which is a reasonable assumption since HonwySwap is a clone of Uniswap and it has been running for 6 months).

See this thread.    xDai Validator (again)       Hello everyone,  I wish to take back ownership of the xDai Validator. I was an initial member of the first validators and am still in control of the private keys, this would mostly be a matter of running the software needed again as well as actively participating in xDai voting and decision making.  I have spoken with Igor and the team from POA as well as the Maker Foundation and they\u2019re ready to do the handoff.  If anyone has any questions, please let me know.     Not sure if this is still up or not I have not checked. As to Maker itself putting MKR on xDAI and backing a LP in Honeyswap.   Honestly would rather do something more productive with funds. One single person could pull some MKR over and fund the MKR/xDAI pair in Honeyswap.   If one larger MKR holder doesn\u2019t see this as useful why should we? Personally I think it would be a good idea.  I have been trying to put up liquidity for some smaller communities (not enough to be sure) and I will see once delegation comes on line whether it even makes sense to continue paying $10-20/vote for MKR as this is pretty expensive for the size of MKR stake I have. I simply don\u2019t have enough liquidity to put up something to get some trading going there. Interestingly MKR on xDAI can\u2019t easily do anything on Main net so this would be MKR that is effectively locked both out of governance and ES or anything else governance wise.   I have to think it would be a thorny issue to be able to use MKR on some sidechain/L2 to control the functioning of MKR on main net. This keeps making me think a Maker fork to xDAI is probably the most logical way to approach this.  Then just fork MKR mainnet balances to some version on xDAI and just go from there.   The whole minting of DAI generally becomes more complicated and honestly I have not even wrapped my brain around the idea generally but this is probably the best way to get MKR on to xDAI.   HOnestly the devil will be in these details. The longer Maker waits to at least think about this the more chance sidechain/L2s will just implement other solutions.  If people want to trade MKR on sidechains well they can put up the liquidity. So I am voting no on this even though I personally would like to be able to trade MKR on Honeyswap. ",
