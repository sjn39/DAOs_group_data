More informed stewards + constituents creates more legitimacy IMO. To achieve that, I\u2019m copying Kris and Kyle.  Kris and Kyle created voter guides ( 1 2 ) which explain which way they are voting and why in S13.  I\u2019ve found that voter guides was an effective way for them to communicate a synthesis of their perspectives on the various budgets + also create accountability by summarizing which way they were voting. To facilitate more discussion of digested budget information among stewards, I am creating a template for a voter guide for S14.   I encourage you to fork it and distribute your own voter guide! Here is what the template looks like:  I encourage you to fork this resource + make + distribute your own copy. ",

My approach was to work with the Ethelo tool to not only surface the reviews (which we have evidence that reviewers are more likely to use and finish reviews), but also to find the true intersubjective consensus. THIS IS A TEST We worked to have this ready for this budget review time. https://gitcoinbudget.ethelo.net/ It uses the tool we use to review grants in FDD. They tool will find the least polarizing, highest consensus answers to allow us to make collective decisions. I think combining a tool like this to allow us to rank the importance of \u201cthin workstream\u201d outcomes overall would be helpful. Then we could use it to review if the amounts being requested are reasonable. @Rebelry and @M0nkeyFl0wer are working to make one better than this implementation for us, but this FDD designed first attempt can showcase quite a bit. Additionally, we could weight the users input in a variety of ways. For example, stewards could weighted by their health score on the report cards. Then ANYONE could participate, but only stewards are weighted to the output scores. Many other options like this could be designed. ",

FDD Budget \u2022 Gitcoin Holdings - Google Chrome 2022-05-19 at 1.28.38 PM1892\u00d71250 206 KB    I am still of the opinion that the following items are not necessary (126.4k USD):  FDD Storytellers (14.4k USD) i\u2019m still not convinced this is needed Gone  FDD Mandate Delivery (16.5k USD) I think this can definitely be a much smaller one-off project that doesn\u2019t cost this much either I don\u2019t think we are communicating the extent of this role. Kish is actively taking over the synthesizing of all our info to understand if we are living up to our mandate in addition to building out dashboards. He will be putting together the entire FDD budget proposal next season. This removes a key man issue. This and oXS are crucial to how we function.  Sybil Detection DAO (60k USD) taking up 9.2% of the budget, I think if its spinning out into a DAO, it should be considered as part of mutual grants We would really like to do the discovery before asking for a mutual grant. What we can\u2019t do is commit to a stake before the other initial governance partners arrive, cause that would kill the concept. Maybe Danilo answer here helps to explain it better. [S14 Proposal] FDD Season 14 Budget Request - #50 by danlessa  Ethelo (13k USD) should be kept separate. We did use it before in public library and I think its a great tool but it isn\u2019t clear why FDD should be developing it. Gone, but we are finishing the already started work of integrating it to the grant review system. We needed a tool to scale our ability to review the massive number of grant applications. We tested ethelo and it worked. They have put up the risk of paying for most of the development this far. The budget was to containerize and automate some processes. Not needed, but will result in lower quality results and higher manual labor costs. (Which is confusing because we are being told to use software solutions instead of increasing manual labor!)  Reward modeling (22.5k USD) when I dived into it and its goal is \u201csystem for incentivizing reviewer participation which maintains output quality is simulated and designed\u201d I think having a budget and paying people for work done is The new format has this in the options. This work would lead to us having a way for communities using grants 2.0 to use community curation for eligibility rather than delegation. I think that would provide communities better results in terms of their desired outcome - better allocating resources to the will of their community. (The other option is to delegate authority through their governance, but we have only seen systems with a central point of failure get corrupted a few times so I may be blowing this out of proportion!) Really though, the fundamental reason why Twitter and Facebook don\u2019t build a system that is more  representative of peoples desires in content moderation is because A - It\u2019s cheaper to delegate  B - They cant have assymentric advantage in how the system works. Reason A is why I think we need to provide this. Because it is a public digital infrastructure, no one entity will invest in it. AND we are SOOO close already!     ",

                    "content": "Voter Guides on the rise Just as in Q1/S13 I created a voter guide. I\u2019d invite all Stewards to create guides as a way to show accountability on voting, plus also to inform their peers, as a way to increase intersubjective consensus. You can start with the template created by @owocki here or you can duplicate this post and make it your own. As a reader, know that you can and should hold your steward(s) accountable on fairly representing you, you can find your (future) Steward via the Steward Health Cards, where you can (re)delegate your voting power at any time. I hesitated to create this because every workstream who worked massively hard on this deserves a way longer explanation than the below, but because so much is at stake (bear market, overall direction of the DAO, and because perfect is the enemy of good (enough)) I went ahead: below some holistic thoughts on how I\u2019ll be voting plus some details per workstream in the table. Background: DAO Operations On the note of lacking time, this is due to working more than full time in the DAO Ops workstream, so I\u2019m looking forward to dividing the workload over some more talented contributors in the near future, and slowly getting there  We\u2019re currently looking for a community management lead and a support lead, a treasury management job description is in the making but feel free to already reach out, and help us spread the word. Other ways to support us is by commenting on our workstream proposal and if you are a Steward we hope you\u2019ll vote YES. I want to note that although my comments are pretty concise they are deeply informed. Know that as an active contributor and co-workstream lead in DAO Ops I am - together with @Jodi - basically part of all the cross-workstream calls and with our various initiatives & its leads we cover a lot of ground within the DAO (Accounting, Community Experience, Community Governance, Devops, People Ops & User Support). It gives a good view on how this organism, this \u2018slime mold\u2019  is evolving and how we can make it better, together. There\u2019s a lot to do. Gitcoin\u2019s Purpose and Essential Intent Especially helpful are our weekly CSDO calls (Cross Stream DAO Operations) which are part of the community experience initiative (in DAO Ops) and the extra strategy sessions (facilitated by @samspurlin from The Ready), which we\u2019ve organized in preparation for S14, where we dove into objectives per workstream. Our latest session, which was about GitcoinDAO\u2019s Purpose and Essential Intent, was the session that I was waiting for to make my own decisions as a Steward. The document you can find here is not our final output - next steps are being worked on by a core team - but we did reach alignment on the fact that we want to focus on 4 points as a DAO (random order!):  Improve Coordination Intra Gitcoin DAO Gitcoin Grants 2.0 (Protocol) Grow Grants GMV Financial Sustainability  The first is at the core of what DAO Ops is about, 2 will be the key mission of the new Grants 2.0 workstream (S15) and part of what Moonshot Collective will be doing in the next seasons. Number 3 is key for Public Goods Funding and FDD (when it comes to anti-sybil defense), and 4 is spread over DAO Ops, future Grants 2.0 and MMM in my opinion, all in their own way. Logically a living organism as Gitcoin DAO does a lot more that indirectly ties into this but the above points plus my logic derived from this will heavily influence my voting behavior. Workstream feedback With that said, here is my assessment of the S14 Budget Requests (as of May 10th \u2013 subject to change) Edit: first change, changed my vote for kernel to Yes     Workstream Recc Comment     MMM Yes I will support this budget as is. It\u2019s been great to see MMM evolve and see it find a balance between being strategic and objective-driven and still leaving enough room for creativity & bottom-up initiative emergence. For me S13 was a transition season and I hope S14 will be the season MMM truly shows its leadership on all things memes, merchandise & especially marketing. More thoughts here    PGF Yes I will be supporting this budget as is, especially with the revised amounts for the categories Publication and ImpactDAO. I hope there will be lots of deep integration with MMM, DAO Ops and others + more budget transparency. More thoughts here.   FDD No I tried to read the many many comments under FDD and grasp the totality of what is being proposed, but I do not have the time to dig in deeper and read it all. I want to vote no, because I think FDD is too complex and is doing too many things that are not focusing on anti-sybil. I wanted to abstain because it feels uncomfortable to vote no without having the time to read through it all but 1) some comments during the Stewards Council made me realize it\u2019s ok to sit with such discomfort and better to vote no than to abstain. 2) the fact that other stewards also mention (during the council) that they cannot evaluate FDD because it is too complex to them is to me the sign that it is. I will defer to other comments under the proposal on where and how budget reductions could be possible, to me it seems it can happen in all initiatives, as there seems to be a lot that is not focused on its core mission. I hope they will take this opportunity to drastically simplify their approach.   Kernel Yes Edit: Changing my vote to Yes based on the updated proposal, of which the amount was amended for the second time. Original thoughts: I appreciate the revised proposal by Kernel and I am one of the biggest promoters of Kernel as an initiative in this space. However, seeing the draft priorities as outlined above of what Gitcoin will be focusing on in the time to come, this is still too much at this moment. For me it makes more sense to immediately fund Kernel as a mutual grant project, which I\u2019d definitely support. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the best interest of Gitcoin to add the complexity of creating another workstream at a moment we want to focus more than ever, I also do not think Kernel wants or needs this distraction while pursuing their mission. Education is however a core public good, and web3 education for that reason lies even closer to my heart. Kernel is in my opinion invaluable, so I see two options here: a lower amount for this season or passing it separately as a partnership & mutual grant. I would support @Fishbiscuit\u2019s proposal for a budget of 49K GTC.   DCompass No I will just copy most of Annika\u2019s comment as it best reflects my views. Given our focus on Grants 2.0 & becoming a Protocol DAO and my lack of clarity as to how dCompass fits into that, I plan to vote no here. However, given how much time and effort has already been put into this project a mutual grant makes a lot of sense to me, and I\u2019d definitely support this. Given the fact that Gitcoin has funded all development up to this point I however hope that we will be able to receive a higher amount of tokens than the 5% mentioned in the comments.   Kudos No This was a tough one. It is a pretty small budget request, but in the light of our need for focus, this makes no sense to me. If we continue to build a decentralized Kudos version, I hope the team can apply to become a part of either Moonshot Collective or the upcoming Grants 2.0 workstream. Another separate workstream at this point does not make sense to me. Again, an alternative is a mutual grant.   MC Yes Moonshot CoIlective has been bringing a whole lot of extra structure into their team in the past season. On top of this it plays an important role in creating the building blocks of Grants 2.0, such as dPopp.   DAO Ops Abstain I will be abstaining here as co-workstream lead who co-created this proposal.    \u2013 Thanks for reading, looking forward to comments and more voter guides.

I\u2019ve done my best to give every budget the attention it asks for (reading everything and deliberating) QZ\u2019s guide tl;dr     Workstream Amount Recc Comment     MMM 152.9K GTC Yes I am supportive of S14\u2019s budget to give MMM some breathing space to hit its stride. Gitcoin\u2019s brand is one of the strongest in the space and I hope to see S14 put MMM into a great position to be able to start reeling in costs come S15 and have a stronger focus.   KERNEL 49K GTC Yes I am supportive of Kernel joining the DAO as a workstream especially with the changes proposed following my recommendation   FDD 118K GTC Abstain As of now I am leaning towards an abstain on this season\u2019s budget because I\u2019m 60% in agreement with FDD\u2019s direction and budgeting. The last week has been brutal on the market and I am of the opinion we need to buckle down our hatches. If during S14 FDD can demonstrate that there is demand for sybil defence outside of Gitcoin and provide a service, then the economics of this workstream will change drastically.   DAO Ops 115K GTC Yes I am voting for this budget but would like to see a clearer reign on costs. Similar to the rationale behind lowering FDD\u2019s budget, I think DAO Ops should aim to try and do more with less season by season.I see DAO Ops as similar to HR/Finance functions. So DAO Ops ideally shouldn\u2019t take up more than 5-6% of GitcoinDAO\u2019s entire proposed budget. Assuming nothing has changed, 115k GTC is 17% of the combined budgets of MMM, PGF, FDD, DAO Ops, and MSC.   MSC 83k GTC Yes I think its important for Gitcoin to keep building our new ways to fund public goods and to fund ourselves. Looking forward to putting some of these tools to action!   Kudos 6.6k GTC No I am voting no because of several reason but ultimately this cannot be a workstream in a DAO as it is its own entity already. Instead lets explore a grant leading to a future token swap. This isn\u2019t a vote against the project itself, but against this method of getting funded.   dCompass 19K GTC No To be this is a clear no because there\u2019s more reserves than what is requested + the format is wrong     ",
