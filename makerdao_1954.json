                    "content": " Executive Summary This post lays out the process for the Fallback Selection of Interim Facilitator for Collateral Engineering Services (CES-001). This is being done according to MIP41c6. Please note this is the first time this procedure has been used and we will have to make many judgment calls that are detailed here. Ultimately, we are looking to find someone the elected facilitators of Maker support for filling the facilitator role for CES. Those interested in this Interim Facilitator role have 24 hours to confirm their intention in this thread. Anyone may volunteer themselves for consideration in the voting process. If an individual is nominated by someone else, we will ask them to confirm they are willing to accept the nomination. We will allow volunteers to propose themselves as co-interim facilitators if they wish. In this instance, they will be voted on as a single option. @Core-Facilitators please note, that per MIP41c6, in addition to any volunteer nominees, all facilitators will be considered. Out of respect for people\u2019s autonomy, we will be allowing current facilitators to withdraw themselves from consideration in this thread for 24 hours. After this nomination process, we will have a 1 week-long vote between active facilitators to consider nominees. This will be done with a ranked-choice (IRV) format. If the IRV process results in a winner, that person will be ratified as interim facilitator effective immediately. Alternatively, if at least 10 facilitators have the same nomination as their first choice after 3 days, we will end the vote prematurely as no other candidate could win the vote.  Timeline  This post announces our intention. Nominations will be open until 21:00 UTC, tomorrow November 24th. Please keep in mind, multiple people can run under one ticket provided they have the consent of all parties. Facilitators will be automatically considered for the vote unless they revoke their nomination in this thread before that time. After 21:00 UTC on 2022-11-24, @Patrick_J and myself will reply to this thread with all nominations, and notify all active facilitators that the vote is on. Each facilitator will be assigned a codename in a joint Discord DM with Patrick and me. Here they will reply with their Ranked Choice votes (including all parties they would support for a role). As Facilitators DM their votes, Patrick and I will update a public spreadsheet showing the anonymized choices here. After 21:00 UTC on 2022-11-27, any nominee receiving 10 or more first-ranked votes will be automatically ratified. If no early termination takes place, voting will be finalized on 2022-12-01 at 21:00 UTC. If IRV produces a winner, that nominee will be immediately ratified. If there is no winner on 2022-12-01, we will be following the 2nd Fallback process, dictating that we repeat these steps but with a 48-hour vote.   Considerations MIP41 requires results for voting to be public. We believe by assigning codenames we can ensure the accuracy of Patrick and my reporting (anyone who has their vote recorded incorrectly can point out the impropriety) while making the process easy for facilitators to participate transparently. Since MIP41c6 says a \u201cminimum quorum\u201d may be used, we intend to use the results at the end of the week, regardless of how many votes have been submitted. The only consideration is if IRV returns a winner, which can only take place when over 50% of voters have listed support for a nominee. Finally, it would be ideal to decide before a full week of waiting. Since it is mathematically impossible for anyone else to win the vote if 10 facilitators list a nominee as their first choice, we will end the vote early (as mentioned above) if this condition is met after a reasonable campaign time, in this case, 3 days. We believe this timeline should result in some clarity for the DAO on a quick time scale, while still respecting that many facilitators might be at lower capacity due to holidays in the US.  Feedback Welcome and Encouraged If you have issues with the above please raise them ASAP. Once the voting starts we will not be changing our methodology, so please consider reading this ASAP @Recognized-Delegates. ",

I have included a screenshot with a highlight for emphasis. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m afraid I have to disagree with your pessimism about IRV as a voting method. Is it perfect? No, no voting system is. But it is used successfully by multiple electoral systems around the world. ",

For consideration, I helped jumpstart and facilitate the CMOFF calls through July of this year in cooperation with CES (7 months). I also co-developed the Auditor Framework and have the governance knowledge required for the role.

Notwithstanding that none of the remaining CES members do not currently have contracts with the CES core unit - we met this morning and we are unanimously in support of @lollike. Furthermore, in good faith myself and my colleagues are prepared to continue working prior to finalization of this vote to deliver the commitments of CES Core Unit - under the assumption that we will be retroactively reimbursed for the services we are providing - by whoever is the new interim facilitator. Also, in good faith, as CES has lost or will lose imminently access to our infrastructure and services I personally have put my personal credit card up to reinstate and transfer these services for the team so that we can operate pending the outcome of the fallback voting process. Collectively the team has decided that until the new interim facilitator is in place we will not be accessing or utilizing any funds from the Operations wallet until a new facilitator is in place. I personally am committed to help @lollike in successfully performing the interim facilitator role. ",
