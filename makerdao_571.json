                    "content": "Authors: Adam Cader, Mika Honkasalo Thanks to Kurt Barry and Hexonaut for review of the proposal Summary of the proposal Instead of voting with MKR, as is done today, this proposal suggests gbMKR (governance-boosted MKR) replace MKR in governance voting. MKR would be locked up to 4 years in a contract to mint gbMKR. The voting weight is equal to: voting_weight = MKR * duration_locked/4_years. Motivation The current Maker governance system allows any holder of the MKR token to vote on proposals that have meaningful long term effects on the protocol. gbMKR improves on existing MKR governance by empowering long-term token holders.  Security.  Currently, governance attacks are possible via borrowing MKR on a platform such as Aave or Compound, or alternatively through an OTC desk like Genesis, and using the MKR to participate in an adverse change to the protocol . As a locked token, gbMKR would aim to secure the MakerDAO system and mitigate such governance attacks.   Long-term value alignment.  gbMKR would benefit MKR holders who intend to hold tokens for a long period of time and be active participants in governance.   Locking MKR supply off the market.  A decrease in the MKR supply means less of it is available on the open markets to sell. This is important because the protocol is healthier if MKR price is higher given MKR backstops any collateral shortfall.   Increase the incentive for DAOs to hold (gb)MKR.  DAOs and protocols can more easily accumulate voting power to influence governance (asset listings, collateral parameter modification, stability fees, etc.). DAOs vote to increase respective debt ceiling or lower the borrowing rate specifically Still, they would have to remain aligned with the long-term growth of the project because of the lock up. For example, lending protocols direct the D3M to their respective money market protocols.    Mechanics Instead of voting with token amount a, MKR tokens are lockable in a VotingEscrow for a selectable locktime t1, where t1 < tmax, and tmax = 4 years. After locking, the time left to unlock is t \u2264 t1. The voting weight is equal to: w = a*t/tmax. The voting power of gbMKR decreases linearly as a function of time since lock. For example, when a user sets a 4 years lock for some amount of gbMKR - that amount has an initial 100% voting weight. After 1 year the weight will be 75%, after 2 years the weight will be 50% and so on. gbMKR holders must continually extend their lock time to maintain voting weight. gbMKR is a non-transferable token. However, as pointed out by YFI, this can be \u201cbypassed via wrapped derivatives such as the Yearn yveCRV vault or Convex\u2019s cvxCRV product.\u201d As additional consideration, users could unlock their gbMKR back into MKR before the set lock time. The tradeoff for the early unlock would be a MKR penalty that is distributed back to the other gbMKR holders. Engineering Considerations Mandate for Maker Developers to create the components at their discretion.  Emergency Shutdown module (deposit gbMKR). Modifications to governance contracts (Voting is based on the internal balance of the caller with the Chief contract. Delegation. Participation in governance could be lower if not considered.  Future considerations This proposal gives gbMKR token holders a governance boost but no additional economic incentives. The following could be implemented later to introduce further incentives:  Ability to borrow DAI at an attractive rate (0% or even negative interest rates). Distribute a part of protocol fees (stability fee + liquidation revenue) directly to gbMKR holders.  Once the maximum level of surplus is reached, DAI is sent to gbMKR holders. Based on community and core team feedback we notice a preference for DAI yields instead of MKR tokens.   Use stability fees to buy back MKR and distribute to gbMKR holders. gbMKR could be added as a collateral type to MakerDAO at an advantageous collateralization ratio, pro longed liquidation time when oracle is called, and 0% stability fee  Additional notes This proposal was partly inspired by the Rune\u2019s comments on his Sagittarius Engine (borrow Dai using their MKR as collateral at a 0% rate with preferential liquidation) proposal: \u201cMKR holders don\u2019t want to borrow money, they want to get money.\u201d The key problems identified with the Saggiratirus Engine proposal was that:  Increasing MKR supply (by an additional 2m MKR) would devalue MKR.  MakerDAO has previously said not to MKR rewards for depositors, borrowers, etc. Existing MKR holders would be diluted.   The SE is too complex and hard to understand.  Compared to existing similar token models such as veCRV, gbMKR initially would be focused on long-term governance participants. Next Steps We welcome any feedback and would like for the community to discuss this proposal and for it incorporate items as needed.    Should MakerDAO implement gbMKR with the described implementation:  Yes Yes (with additional economic incentives including burn, fee distribution, and buyback) No Abstain     0 voters     Signal ends in 7 days (2022-02-08).

It seems more feasible to reach consensus with the smallest possible change.     paraficapital:  gbMKR holders must continually extend their lock time to maintain voting weight.   Considering gas prices, this gives me pause. Instead of a continuous linear curve, how about discretized 1, 3, or 6-month linear steps (if this isn\u2019t clear, happy to provide a formula)? Also, it seems reasonable to allow a locktime t1 > tmax as long as the voting weight is set to min(t,tmax)/tmax.     paraficapital:  As additional consideration, users could unlock their gbMKR back into MKR before the set lock time. The tradeoff for the early unlock would be a MKR penalty that is distributed back to the other gbMKR holders.   I like the idea, but I\u2019m not sure whether this could be implemented in a gas efficient way. Would the early withdrawal penalty be distributed proportional to the amount of MKR locked in gbMKR or proportional to the gbMKR voting weight?  Misc questions Some work is needed to map out how to transition from MKR to gbMKR. How much gbMKR must exist before we switch over? Could Core Unit MKR budgets be distributed in locked gbMKR instead of MKR? ",

                    "content": "I think protecting the protocol from being affected by borrowed MKR is a worthwhile endeavor, and that this is one solution to this problem. You cite two factors as a motivation for this proposal that I believe warrant further investigation:  governance participation may suffer locking MKR supply off the market  My hypothesis is that: Without economic incentives for locking up MKR, this proposal would:  decrease the already paltry governance participation the lockup mechanism will be ineffective at relieving sell-side pressure on MKR  You have three sets of MKR holders: A. a large majority who have no interest in participating in governance B. a small minority who delegate C. an even smaller minority who actively participate in governance Adding lockups without incentives to participate in governance won\u2019t stimulate anyone in set A to lock-up their tokens. Members of Set B and C are already participating in governance and empirically tend not to sell, but some subset will stop participating in governance due to the undesirable restrictions of locking up their tokens. Conclusion: This proposal would add a defense mechanism against a subset of governance attacks utilizing borrowed MKR. It does not cover the cases where the rewards of executing an attack outweigh the fair market value of the borrowed MKR. It will not decrease sell-side pressure on MKR and may even increase it. The proposal does this at the expense of governance participation which will likely further decline if it\u2019s implemented. I suspect you already know this, and you mention that this simplified mechanism was chosen because it is more likely to pass Maker Governance. My premise is that without incentives it\u2019s a net negative rather than a net positive. My suggestion to \u2018fix\u2019 the proposal would be that you remove MKR burning (or dai yield to MKR holders) and only burn gbMKR (or Dai yield to gbMKR holders). And at that point you may as well just go full Sagittarius Engine mode and let people generate Dai against gbMKR with favorable rates to further incentivize lockups. ",

I would be interested in seeing to what extent this proposal can be regarded as a subset/component of a larger MKR tokenomics redesign (ie. Saggitarius Engine ). I was intrigued by this idea by @AstronautThis though:     AstronautThis:  Is it possible to change the voting power of MKR tokens from the current function where each token has the same weight to some function that depends on how long it has been since that token was deposited into the voting proxy or a delegation contract? For example, deposited MKR has a voting weight that increases linearly for x days until it reaches it\u2019s full voting weight.   This would be like an activation period affecting the voting weight of MKR tokens that enter the governance system from outside. The countdown affecting an actor\u2019s voting weight would start once their MKR is deposited in Maker governance through either the Chief contract, a delegate contract or a vote proxy. Not sure how we\u2019d account for the MKR that\u2019s simply held in their wallet though\u2014currently these funds to contribute to poll voting weight.  ",

For example, MKR simply held in a wallet could have a voting weight of 0.5 which would be the same as the voting weight of MKR deposited into the contracts on Day 1. You could increase that weight all the way to 1 over some period. This choice doubles the cost for an attacker using borrowed MKR.

I\u2019m a big proponent of transferring governance power to long-term believers to improve decision making and (valuable) participation. However, as @NikKunkel pointed out, the main flaw in your proposal is that there aren\u2019t enough incentives in place for tokenholders to lock their tokens. I propose the following changes to your proposal: In order to increase their governance power, users must stake MKR in a voting proxy or delegation contract. In doing so, they will earn gbMKR over time. gbMKR is a non-transferrable token which gives you a boost in governance power and will emit according to the amount of MKR you staked and how long it\u2019s been staked for. This means that:  The more MKR you stake, the more gbMKR you get The longer your MKR has been staked for, the more gbMKR you get The more gbMKR you hold, the more your governance power is boosted  Basically, gbMKR\u2019s sole purpose is to determine the extent of your governance power boost. Tokenholders should be able to unstake their MKR from the voting proxy whenever they want (with no lock-up). However, if they unstake even just a tiny fraction of their staked MKR from the voting proxy, they would lose all of the gbMKR they accrued over time. This would make sure that if a tokenholder sells even just a tiny fraction of their MKR, they would lose their boosted governance powers, since they\u2019d have to unstake their MKR from the voting proxy to do so. A flaw that could emerge from this mechanism: tokenholders could just create multiple addresses to earn a controlling amount of voting power in the protocol. To prevent this from happening, there would be a max amount of gbMKR that could be earned over time. This would increase the voting boost linearly for x days until max voting boost is reached. This is just an initial idea that came to mind after reading the proposal and comments, so it would need refinement of course. I encourage you to poke holes in this mechanism and share your thoughts. But overall, I do believe that it would be a better mechanism as users wouldn\u2019t need to lock their tokens up to boost their governance powers. Also it would make sure that they lose their boosted powers as soon as they sell any of their MKR. ",

                    "content": "I\u2019m not a fan of veTokenomics, and will try to share my main reasons for skepticism below. Reduced investor base Governance decentralization depends on a broad group of stakeholders/token holders sharing power. Long term token locking (such as veCRV tokenomics) makes it difficult or impossible for many persons or entities to own MKR; this could include defi or custodial index funds (see DPI index exclusion of CRV due to locking), VC fund holdings, closed end funds and trust products (eg. Grayscale funds), and small to medium sized retail owners. Simply put, many potentially valuable stakeholders and investors don\u2019t have the luxury to be able to accept long term illiquidity. So adopting long term locking could lead to concentration of governance power and less decentralization. Staking derivatives In the same vein, long term locking creates incentives for staking derivatives which can potentially split economic interest from voting power while concentrating control over the protocol. Examples of this within the Curve ecosystem include yveCRV and cvxCRV. This has the potential to reduce governance decentralization (eg. Convex has around 50% of Curve voting power), and also leads to incentive alignment issues because users have no way to exit or withdraw voting power from a poor manager and managers have only indirect exposure to asset value. Short term incentives In a market as volatile as crypto, we can expect investors to use a high discount rate when judging risk adjusted returns. When combined with long term (eg. 4 year) token locks, this heavily depresses the net present value at stake for each unit of voting power. As an example, if an investor assumes a 20% discount rate on their investment and 4 year lockup, the net present value of their locked tokens is only 48% of the current market value. For owners or protocols that continuously relock their stake to maintain maximum voting and earning power, their return becomes similar to a perpetual bond, where the value of locked tokens drops to $0 and only payouts are included in NPV. This can create perverse incentives, where locked token holders can increase the net present value of their stake by favoring short term focused payout increases (either through risky protocol changes or accepting bribes) at the expense of long term value creation. Bribery Bribes are often touted as a huge benefit of the veCRV token mechanism. There\u2019s no denying that they can be lucrative. But Curve represents a special case, as protocol governance doesn\u2019t have access to user funds and doesn\u2019t offer insurance to LPs. This means the financial risk of accepting bribes for Curve voters is limited to just the cost of any CRV incentives issued. For other protocols with large treasury reserves, user funds at risk, or protocol level insurance, governance faces much higher risk. This makes bribery unsuitable for lending or stablecoin protocols like MakerDAO. Projects bribing for liquidity incentives are only willing to pay up to a certain percent of expected reward value as bribes (otherwise they would just incentives liquidity directly), meaning that the deal is always value negative for Curve before accounting for extrinsic value of incentives (higher TVL, better overall protocol adoption, trading fees, etc). But as long as the bribe yield (bribes paid / CRV rewards) is higher than the percent of CRV locked, veCRV holders still come out ahead by essentially profiting from dilution of unlocked holders. This is a troublesome dynamic which could lead to potentially worse outcomes for protocols with more expansive governance power like Maker. For example, if potential credit losses from onboarding a low quality collateral are less than bribes paid divided by share of tokens locked in governance, voters would come out ahead by accepting the bribe (private gains, socialized losses). By forcing investors to effectively discount the value of their tokens through locking, the threshold to get owners to accept bribes (even if they are negative for token price) is much lower. We can also expect a portion of investors may lose confidence in the project while their tokens are still locked; for investors expecting a large markdown due to mismanagement and self-dealing, there\u2019s almost no financial incentives at stake to prevent accepting value destructive bribes. Prisoners\u2019 dilemma Vote locking is praised for raising the cost of governance attacks; attackers can\u2019t sell their voting stake back to the market so any tokens used are effectively a sunk cost. But vote locking also raises the cost of defense against governance attacks and takeovers. Resisting a takeover would require starting or increasing token locks, which imposes significant costs on defenders (risk of losing relevant governance votes, plus factoring in illiquidity discount on locked holdings). Large owners may find it difficult to safely exit their investment, with long periods of declining governance power and system security before tokens can be sold on the market to new owners. Whenever there is a transition of ownership, the amount of MKR \u201con the hat\u201d would fall for multi year periods. We can\u2019t depend on leaving investors to relock their tokens to defend the protocol. In addition, owners may further discount the expected exit value of their tokens due to governance risks as they withdraw; this would exacerbate issues of poor governance and incentive alignment caused by low value at stake. I personally consider veTokens to be uninvestable due to these incentive issues and high likelihood of governance breakdown. ",

From the 2 biggest MKR holders in the chief contract, the biggest should lock for 4 years. A16Z (the second one) will probably not. Let\u2019s assume all the others lock (or not). Hence you end up with a higher concentration of voting and more power for the first one. This is how I see it, I can be wrong. If you are a small investor, you have less influence so less incentive to lock. In the scenario above (even in case only the first one lock, you can lock as much as you want, you still don\u2019t matter much.

From the point of view of the large owners and the whales, thinking in purely financial terms, it is indeed a problematic system. But let\u2019s look at it from the perspective of the small and very committed owners. I think a long term vested MKR is good for the protocol and equally good for these small long term owners, because:  Combined with a proper reward system, it can be a great benefit for smaller MKR owners who do not have to bear the risks of another lending protocol and their long-term vested MKR will benefit them in the present.  Depending on the amount of tokens committed, this method can mitigate the risk of price falls generated by stop loss orders, panic selling, etc. in the event of sudden market dumping such as we have just experienced.  If we assume that in the long run a \u201cmany small owners - at most one or two large owners\u201d is a more desirable ownership structure for the Maker than a \u201cdozen large - small amount of little\u201d, then this could be a good direction, it is a question of who we want to favour. I voted to abstain because in the absence of a reward system, I see no point in talking about \u201cve\u201d tokenomics due to lack of motivation, and the Saggitarius Engine also contains an adequate solution to the problem.
