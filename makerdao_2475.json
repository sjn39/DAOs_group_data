                    "content": "Hello, This is my proposal to include Chi Gastoken (CHI) as a collateral asset for MCD.  1) Who is the interested party for this collateral application? wjmelements, founder of bitcog LLC, former engineer at TrustToken, MetaMask, and Snapchat  2) Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. 1 CHI corresponds to 1 SELFDESTRUCT refund, currently worth 24000 gas. It\u2019s value tracks the product of its ~36000 gas creation cost and the long-term \u201csafeLow\u201d gasPrice. It\u2019s primarily used by traders on 1inch Exchange to offset gas costs by up to 50%, but anyone can mint or redeem it. ERC20 Address: 0x0000000000004946c0e9f43f4dee607b0ef1fa1c  3) Provide a brief history of the project. Chi Gastoken was 1inch.exchange\u2019s submission to the 2020 ETHGlobal hackathon. 1inch.exchange launched Chi Gastoken 45 days ago as a more-efficient alternative to the long-established GST2. It has overtaken GST2 in AMM liquidity and volume but hash reached 1/3 of GST2\u2019s market capitalization in that short time.  4) Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. No audit available  5) Link to any active communities relating to your project. 1inch Telegram 1inch Twitter  6) How is the applying collateral type currently used? Investors primarily acquire CHI in anticipation of saving gas during network congestion, during which network bandwidth is more valuable. Gastokens provide stability to the gas price by both consuming cheap bandwidth and doubling bandwidth under high demand. Chi is directly integrated within 1inch.exchange, but other services may integrate it, and they would hold their value even if 1inch ceased to exist.  7) Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? No, CHI is fully decentralized and trustless.  8) Where does exchange for the asset occur? Uniswap V2 and Airswap ",

As a better example than the one I produced above\u2014imagine that 100x the current totalSupply of GST2 were minted 3 years ago when the token was first created. That would mean that the market cap of GST2 would be $140M right now. In that case, the USD value of each token in this scenario would be equivalent to what it is today. That 100x number could just as easily be 1x or 1000x, but the USD value of the tokens would still remain bounded by the floor and ceiling while the market cap could be anywhere from 1x to 1000x what it is now. As an FYI, the ceiling mentioned above is the gasPrice and USD price combo where someone can mint and sell for a profit in a single tx and the floor is the gasPrice and USD price combo in which arb bots will buy and use the token for a profit in a single tx. There are already bots performing both actions right now. I do not disagree with what you are both saying. I am pointing out that these token\u2019s value can be better described by the bounded floor and ceiling of the cost of their mintability/useablitiy relative to the current gasPrice. ",

Long-term the price should in theory stabilize around the two fundamentals: the price of gas in ETH and the price ETH in USD, with probably a discount because actually using CHI is a bit of a hassle. However, this has not happened yet, and there is no guarantee that it will. At the time of writing this, CHI is traded at $1.18 yet it contains nearly $2 worth of gas. A few hours ago it was over $3 and the price was falling. In this case the natural ceiling has not been reached as it would now still cost more to mint CHI than the AMM price. ",
