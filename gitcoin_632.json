As you well know, the Gitcoin mission has been focused around building and funding public goods. As the DAO continues its journey to accomplish and strengthen this, I would like to propose the following as a better crystallised goal and modus operandi. Gitcoin DAO builds for human thriving. Gitcoin\u2019s vision is to establish an empowering, open and collaborative space where individuals and communities can access resources in proportion to their value creation independent of their geographic location, education, background or offline identity. By creating collaborative, decentralized funding mechanisms, Gitcoin has become the natural choice for seeding and supporting digital public goods. The DAO enables building for the public, by the public by helping individuals and communities start, fund, and scale open source projects. All thoughts, comments and responses to this are welcome and encouraged. ",

The DAO enables building for the public  One thing - I think it would be useful to define who the public is here. My personal view is that the public is a series of circles that sometimes overlap and sometimes do not. e.g. the public that serves ENS can also be the public that Gitcoin serves can also be the public that Ethereum serves. Whats exciting to me is the intersection of these overlapping circles + the opportunity to force multiply projects that serve multiple public goods.  Screen Shot 2021-12-14 at 1.00.53 PM2128\u00d71182 404 KB  e.g. if Project X\u2081 is in QF Matching Round Y\u2081, the matching multiple of that is Z\u2081. And if you add Project X\u2081 to Y\u2082Y\u2083\u2026Y\u2099, then the matching multiple of it becomes Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083*\u2026Z\u2099.  essentially if each QF round for each public is a fan, then all-together they stack to be a jet engine.
