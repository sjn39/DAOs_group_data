UPDATE: NO LONGER APPLICABLE, SINCE THEY HAVE RAISED REQUIRED FUND FOR THE MOVIE, lets just wait and enjoy the premier! I think it would be of great benefit for Uniswap community to become one of the major backers for the movie, for various reasons:  Promotion through titles, etc Further solidify ourselves as a major player in ethereum community Potential opportunity to market among non-crypto masses  Costs: It varies, but if we set to become the major backer of the movie, current top giver is at 20 ETH, so that would require use to donate around 2500 UNI Further ideas: Since becoming top 3 backers receives certain unique ecosystem artefacts (NFTs) and in future there will be more opportunities to participate and some of them would require constant monitor of the metaverse and ability to execute as fast as possible, I could envision some sort of fund, i.e Uniswap museum where professional committee of artefacts gatherers could act on our behalf to gather and present the pieces of the metaverse, but for now I think we can focus on becoming of the top 3 backers for the movie and set out a precedent and proof for further discussions regarding the need for such fund/entity Lets discuss the most suitable approach and try to act quickly upon this, since funding goal is at 30% as of right now disclaimer: I\u2019ve personally funded 0.25 ETH towards the movie, as seen in this tx Link to snapshot: I don\u2019t have enough UNI to start a proposal, so if anyone wants to delegate to me or start one on this temp check behalf, feel free to do so, and ping me, to update this post!

This is something I could refer my mother to, and she might take more away from it than \u201ccrypto is a scam.\u201d Looks like there\u2019s a pretty good value add considering the production crew\u2019s history, Vitalik\u2019s involvement. It is surely something UNI should back- even 10 ETH might have a better social reach that the broadly defined Defi Education Fund (which essentially ends up being bribes one way or another). At least this is opens doors to folks that have no clue about the cryptocurrency community as outsiders looking in. If the film reaches millions of views the value add, is pennies per view. Considering the reach can break out of our community I see any contribution as extremely beneficial to Uniswap. ",

Since we are a little time restricted by funding deadline which is on Friday, July 16th at 3pm PDT/6pm EDT and by the actual funding limit, which currently sits at 500/750 ETH  top bid at 25 ETH to get into top 20 and hence mentioned in the titles will require only ~3-5 ETH  We shouldn\u2019t  be letting our hopes down, although we haven\u2019t even started discussing technical aspects of execution this funding. Some update as of right now: We would probably require at least 3300 UNI to make a 30 ETH for top bid (only 56 000$, in comparison unigrants paid $15 000 to bankless dao for one month of integrations on their YouTube) But I would suggest getting for this proposal 4500 UNI for ability to incrementally bid in auction, and after send any unused funds to unigrants or something like that ",
