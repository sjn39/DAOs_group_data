Abstract This standard outlines a smart contract interface based on ERC-721, which is a standard for non-fungible tokens. The key issue of using it is that an original author who creates an item cannot receive any fees after giving or selling it to another.  Creator\u2019s Royalty Token enables creators to get a fee whenever the token is transferred, which has a function of the decentralized exchange. Hence, a partial amount of the transaction value will always be paid to the creator.
