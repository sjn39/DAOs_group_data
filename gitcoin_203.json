My grants now for every 100 dollars I receive 1, is there any reason why the grants are like this? Is the quadratic distribution algorithm not working for all grants?

Gitcoin has grown quite a lot and some of the top grants now see thousands of contributors, which means that grants with less than 50 contributions dont get much matching. We have been getting feedback that some folks in our community wish we had more support for OSS, so in GR16 we may do a round just for OSS devs like yourself  ",

I\u2019m a big believer in the project, but I\u2019m really not happy with how things are working out. In the last round there was even a celebration of the funds that remained in the pool, but if they stayed it was because they were not distributed. I even thought I was attacked by spam but I was not notified. ",
