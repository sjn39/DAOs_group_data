The end is a horizon to guide us through this maze. This maze is a road on which we see only a few paces ahead, and then must choose: Which way, right or left?  The last minute events of the Gemini GUSD PSM partnership vote have caused quite a stir in the community and controversy. We love to see it. (For those unfamiliar with the details: Coindesk covered it - we have no private knowledge as to the accuracy of the facts.) The essence of the controversy is MakerDAO\u2019s integration with TradFi via its reliance on CeFi and the legacy markets. The ongoing debate neglects what is equally true: TradFi is integrating with us. This pleases ACREinvest as we said on Thursday, but not for the reasons many may assume. Perhaps some readers were surprised we voted in favor of continuing the Gemini relationship given how assertive we have been in raising the alarm about escalating risks since MID NOVEMBER and emphasizing the need to actively manage them. So, why are we pleased? And why share this meditation? We share our views here to answer a question posed in community Discord conversation. We also hope it provides transparency and a public record of what the ACREinvest Platform stands for and seeks to stand-by in our service as a Recognized Delegate. Please hold us to this. Long-standing, heart-broken, frustrated and furious liberty-maxi members of this community want to know - they want to hear even a single argument as to - how what\u2019s going on can advance their goals for a permission-less, censorship resistant and truly decentralized MakerDAO-powered ecosystem of open finance for the world. These were the original principles and the cause that drew them in at the first. Let us be clear. ACREinvest is firmly and resolutely WITH the Originalists. For us, their goal is the right and only one. Where we may differ is that we believe the goal is located at a horizon line and to get there we must first traverse a maze. If we conflate our end-goal with the means needed to get there, we will fail. This point brings us back to why we are glad today. Not because MakerDAO is becoming MOAR dependent on Gemini or Circle or Paxos, or any centrally controlled and U.S. regulated institutional player. No, we do not celebrate that. We celebrate what the GUSD vote proves: They are becoming more dependent on us.  MakerDAO finds itself at an interesting moment of demonstrated utility as DeFi market infrastructure that CeFi needs to stabilize capital flows, burnish tarnished reputations and mitigate capital losses for TradFi market participants so that the contagion from our current industry crisis can be contained. PLEASE READ THAT AGAIN  This is what we meant by:    ACREinvest Delegate Platform   Speaking of reputation, we think maintaining the PSM at this difficult time may provide some relief to those who are victims of the contagion and this is a role MakerDAO should be proud to serve.   And the proof is in the pudding:   twitter.com    Maker @MakerDAO  Maker Governance is seeing a new all-time high and record levels of activity.  \u2022 Total MKR delegated hit a new all-time high of 162.04k MKR  \u2022 Total MKR deposited in the Maker Governance contract is approaching its previous all-time high of 215.22k MKR. https://t.co/fm8JnySiRR   5:53 PM - 19 Jan 2023           34                9            The GUSD controversy has given us Originalists more of what we actually want: Greater participation and active engagement by all stakeholders, especially large MKR holders. Whales ousting whales at the buzzer is fine by us, especially if enough whales do it so there\u2019s some kind of balance of powers at play. We are NOT fine to find out there is evidence someone may have intentionally tried to disrupt the vote with a DDOS attack. On the other hand, this lets us know that we must be involved in something worthwhile and important enough to rouse sleeping whales and be targeted!  What if we told you in the END there is a flippening. No, not that flippening. We speak of an Infrastructure Inversion that\u2019s not at all about L1 supremacy per se. But it\u2019s what we are after here at MakerDAO. The road to the END must also embody a vision for how we can possibly survive anywhere close to as intended while integrating and cooperating with such filthy things as laws and regulatory authorities. MakerDAO has an opportunity that Providence has probably only granted to us given the project\u2019s history, network effects and demonstrations that even among our most powerful and influential whales - competition (and de-centralization) among them is alive and well!  This is GOOD NEWS for DAI holders and the Originalists. As we go forward, ACREinvest believes a culture of maximum transparency and accountability will continue to hold us in a delicate balance with the leverage we need to be at the tables where our ultimate fate will be decided.  If we can become an essential partner in supporting the liquidity and asset conversion needs of TradFi and show with on-chain proofs that our methods are uniquely able to add a backbone of SAFETY and SOUNDESS for the larger world-wide financial system, then\u2026 Frens, we can have our say as to the appropriate rules under which MakerDAO shall be confirmed to operate lawfully in every jurisdiction whilst preserving the outcomes we hold most dear.  Our most dear outcomes are not the further enrichment of Founders or any institutional incumbent whether crypto-native or otherwise. The outcomes we must seek are the only ones that will fortify us toward victory in the years ahead. Outcomes for the people that need fair access to finance. Outcomes that keep the rest of global finance honest. Our transparency and trust model must be superior. We will out compete any competitor with our values and the demonstration of them. Not by good intentions, but by cryptographic proofs. We are well on our way.  ",
