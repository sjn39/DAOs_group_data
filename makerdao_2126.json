                    "content": "  In short   In the first month of 2023 DUX team has been working on a technical Proof-of-Concept application for the SubDAO app project (ie. one of the Pregame products and blockers for Early Game launch).   We\u2019ve also progressed with its visual & UX design and started engaging with relevant stakeholders on the design front.   The first usable milestone of the SubDAO app will be fully focussed on easy governance and is being referred to as\u2026 Easy Governance Frontend.   We are currently making improvements to the Governance Portal backend, in order to make it more robust & efficient.   We were confronted with a (D)DoS attack on the Governance Portal and collaborated with TechOps to handle the situation and implement mitigation steps   Lots of positive team updates this month, including a new fulltime dev hire      Product updates  SubDAO app The highly challenging requirements for this application (regarding resilience and extensibility) are pushing us towards a web3 tech stack that we\u2019re less experienced with. In order to account for this fact we\u2019re currently working on a barebones proof-of-concept application of the SubDAO app, in which we put the feasibility of our architecture design into practice. The goal is learn quickly and fail early, so that we can tweak the technical architecture design early on and have more confidence during implementation of actual end-user-facing features. In the meantime we\u2019re also shaping the first usable milestone of the app, which will be fully focussed on Endgame governance. This \u2018Easy Governance Frontend\u2019 will allow for quick & easy delegation of MKR voting weight to governance strategies formed by voter committees and supported by delegates. This milestone is our #1 priority at this point.  Governance Portal This month @hernandoagf joined our team to work on the Governance Portal while the rest of the team focusses on Endgame-related projects. Besides small fixes & tweaks in the UI we\u2019ve defined some backend improvements that will make the Governance Portal run more efficient and robust, so that it can run reliantly without too much attention over the coming few years. Also, last month we were faced with an alleged (D)DoS attack on the Governance Portal, which occurred just when a controversial governance poll was expiring, and temporarily disrupted the app\u2019s performance. We collaborated with TechOps to handle the situation when it happened, conduct a root-cause analysis and define improvements to mitigate these events. We\u2019re happy to report that the most important mitigation steps have been implemented by now. Big shoutout to the @techops-core-unit team for their response time, thoroughness and support this past month .   Team updates  New fulltime hire After an intense hiring process with quite some capable candidates, we\u2019re happy to share the news that we hired an additional fulltime developer to help us deliver on Endgame-related projects. H\u00e9ctor will be starting work in March but we\u2019re already collaborating on his onboarding. We\u2019re excited to have him join us and we\u2019re confident he\u2019ll bring a boost to the DUX dev team.  Return of unused funds February 2023 marks the start of our new budget cycle, hence we\u2019re working to return unused funds from our previous budget cycle. DUX will return a total of 748,494.08 DAI (plus dust) to the Maker protocol via DssBlow, from our auditor wallet. Shoutout to @Dracaena27 from the SES team for helping us calculate & return the sum, and also for continuously helping us out with financial reporting matters over the past year.   New DUX baby!   We\u2019re very happy to report that one of the DUXies was blessed with another healthy newborn DUX baby in January!    Questions or comments based on this update?

CU Governance & Administration  Continued the repositioning of SAS to make us as productive as possible regarding Pregame and Endgame. Out of this, a few new work streams emerged in January. See in the other sections below. Evaluated different financing options as the current financing expires by End of March. Based on this evaluation, new MIPs will best posted shortly.   Endgame Mandate  Strategic  As part of the Governance Security group, members of SAS are contributing to the design of the governance security scope framework. Especially focusing on bringing in the perspective of future software development service EAs. Smart Contract Toolkit for SubDAOs: We wrote an early draft of it and conducted a few more interviews. We encountered a few practical blockers in the SC development process, which we need to resolve next. This might take some time, so this stream will have lower priority in the next month. Engaged with different stakeholders to identify opportunities to work on Eendgame-related artifacts. We will build the Switchboard Ecosystem API as part of the Powerhouse product suite that is spearheaded by SES. Based on ideas from an Endgame work group, we kicked off a new developer accessibility stream: SAS Developer Diary.   Technical  Went through a full review cycle with PE on 1inch callee and improved the contract along the way Formalized input and learnings from PE and encoded as much as possible in a dedicated linter (solhint-plugin-makerdao)  Will incorporate linter in our development process to ensure more resource-efficient review cycles in the future   Development of a second exchange-callee contract that takes advantage of the Uniswap Smart Order Router \u2013 a frontend-friendly library to compute the best exchange route using liquidity from both Uniswap v2 and Uniswap v3 liquidity sources as well as working with split routes out of the box . In comparison to the 1inch callee developed last month, this one uses less liquidity sources, but does not depend on any off-chain API and is therefore more robust. The contract and its test were published and are currently under review (see PR).   Auctions related  Pushed the development stream to package the Unified Auctions UI into a Desktop application Enabled configuration of the RPC URL via UI Released v1.0.0 of the Unified Auctions UI Desktop app  The first version doesn\u2019t include an update strategy, yet. Users need to proactively check for newer releases and update the app accordingly. Once the update strategy is in place we will inform more broadly about the desktop app.     1304\u00d7984 71.8 KB   Outlook February  Engaging in the RFC phase of the MIPs that define the future of SAS Moving forward the Desktop App development stream with an update strategy and extension of supported wallets Extending the Unified Auctions UI and Keeper with the two new callee contracts Identify further opportunities to improve DX for protocol contributors Work on Switchboard Ecosystem API with SES Collaborating with PE, GovAlpha, and CES to further formalize the Governance Security Scope Framework  ",

                    "content": "  In short   In February we finished work on the technical proof-of-concept application for the SubDAO app project, which left us feeling confident about our stack and optimistic about building resilient frontends using web3 tech.   Right now we\u2019re working on designing & developing the Easy Governance Frontend (EGF) which is slated for launch in pregame. In parallel we\u2019re coordinating with other teams and stakeholders to figure out how Maker\u2019s governance and delegation needs to change in light of Endgame (ie. Sagittarius Engine, governance strategies, CVCs, etc.)   We started our first team offsite of the year, scheduled around the ETHDenver conference.   Wrapping up work on the Governance Portal API work to make it more robust and efficient\u2014we\u2019ll deploy the changes after the Endgame Constitution MIP poll concludes.   Took some security measures for the Governance Portal, in light of the upcoming controversial Endgame Constitution MIP poll\u2014we\u2019re expecting a lot of traffic for this one.     Product updates  SubDAO app Earlier this year we started work on a technical proof-of-concept application to prove the feasibility of the app\u2019s architecture design. Last month we finished that milestone and shared it with some individuals across relevant CUs and stakeholder groups. Right now we feel confident about building the EGF and SubDAO app based on our selected stack/designed architecture. For clarify; the EGF (Easy Governance Frontend) is a first workking milestone of the SubDAO app and will be made available as a separate app. Currently we\u2019re progressing on the UI/UX design and technical development of the app. Over the past few weeks we\u2019ve slowly started sharing progress and sneak-previews with select stakeholders throughout the DAO. We can\u2019t wait to share some designs once certain Endgame mechanisms are designed/confirmed. Okay, here\u2019s one little sneak preview    Screenshot 2023-03-09 at 14.17.591478\u00d71156 155 KB  In parallel we\u2019ve coordinated with Rune and other core units in order to understand the design of the Sagittarius Engine and required changes to MakerDAO\u2019s vote delegation system. We\u2019re actively contributing to this process since the on-chain components will be very influential to the UX of the EGF.  Governance Portal Earlier this year Hernando joined our team to work on the Governance Portal whilst the rest of the team focusses on Endgame-related projects. Hernando recently finished work on the Governance Portal API and app to make it more robust and efficient in terms of handling governance data. We decided to push back the deployment of these updates until later this month, after the Endgame Constitution MIP poll closes. On that same topic; since the Endgame Constitution MIP poll seems highly controversial and high-profile we\u2019ve collaborated with TechOps Core Unit to define some additional measures to protect the Governance Portal from attacks and keep it running amidst traffic peaks:   We\u2019re increasing the frequency of automated testing   We\u2019re introducing high-attention timeframes for both teams\u2014during these times both teams are extra attentive of the Governance Portal performance and availability (incl its dependencies)   We\u2019ve created a new channel on the MakerDAO Discord server called  voting-support, where any issues can be reported.   Later this week we\u2019ll share documentation on how to manually vote using Etherscan, in any scenario where the Governance Portal becomes temporarily unavailable. We\u2019ll do everything we can to keep it running      Team updates  ETHDenver offsite    Last month we started our first team offsite of the year. Besides spending quality bonding time with the team we had some goals for the offsite. Primarily; defining and breaking down work related to the EGF and SubDAO app, which is best done in person. We also set out to coordinate with other teams and stakeholders\u2014we met with people from GovAlpha, PE, SES, the Ecosystem Scope, some delegates, and more! The focus was mostly on the Sagittarius Engine, changes to delegation and the EGF. Last but not least we got inspired and energized by the ETHDenver conferences, and we were able to build our relationship with protocol/tooling teams that we rely on (eg. Alchemy, MetaMask, Hats Protocol)  Philip back from paternal leave   We\u2019re happy to report Phil is now the dad of a heathy newborn, and he\u2019s slowly getting back into gear. Right now I\u2019m feeling very good about our team\u2014we\u2019re in a good shape right now! I\u2019m feeling proud and grateful to be working with a fun and talented team    Questions or comments based on this update? Please reach out in the comments below or join our Discord server.  ",

CU Governance & Administration  Repositioned CU to become a trusted custom software development service and to acquire as many project-based funded MakerDAO projects as possible. This is reflected in the proposed mandate adjustment and rebranding into Sidestream Automation Services (SAS) and the team\u2019s role in the Ecosystem Scope. Published new budget proposal to finance CU operations. The core idea is to rely on project-based funds whenever possible.   Endgame Mandate  Enablement  Continued contribution of SAS members to the design of the governance security scope framework. Especially focusing on bringing in the perspective of a future software development service Ecosystem Actor. Smart Contract Toolkit for SubDAOs: Created a first UI mockup to further conceptualize the product idea. Given some practical blockers in Maker\u2019s current Smart Contract development process, we timebox the time spent on this work stream to not waste resources\u2026 Started conversations with different stakeholders to source more software project opportunities in the Maker universe (e.g. UI for Dai bridge). If you hear of any software development opportunities in the Maker universe, please let us know.   Execution  Got 1inch-based exchange callee merged into the exchange-callee repository in close collaboration with PE (see PR) Kicked off Switchboard Ecosystem API development  gathered requirements for full project as well as more detailed requirements for first phase (see issue) kicked off development: initialised repo, added org-members, figured out permissions, added linting, testing, \u2026 started to work on first features: authentication, db models added, orm initialization etc.     Auctions related  Refactored code base to accommodate the new exchange callees Released v1.18.0 of the Unified Auction UI including an update to the desktop app  New app image creation (for all major OS) is now part of the CI/CD pipeline Automated update strategy for existing app users     Outlook March  Finish MVP of Switchboard Ecosystem API Get next exchange callee merged into the exchange-callee repository Integrate two new callees to Unified Auction UI Identify further endgame-related development work opportunities  ",
