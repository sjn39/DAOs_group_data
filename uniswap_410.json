As UNI holders, we are enormously reliant on the continued engagement of liquidity providers, yet unless they are both a UNI-V2 LP holder and a UNI holder, their voice is ignored from snapshots and governance. They currently have no way to create a unified way to voice their opinions and concerns. I am recommending that we aim to solve this by introducing a Snapshot.page that allows UNI-V2 LP holders to signal their opinions. I say this because if we consistently make decisions that push away LPs we are in deep trouble. While this of course would not entitle UNI-V2 LP holders to protocol fees, their input into the governance process - I feel - will be a net good for all stakeholders.  EDIT: I should also clarify that I don\u2019t think we should expect LPs to buy UNI to have their say. As mentioned, we are reliant on LPs and should make their input as frictionless as possible. I also wouldn\u2019t imagine LP holders would have UNI proportional to their value as an LP (put simply, if they LP for 10% of the protocol, it\u2019s reasonable to assume they won\u2019t also have 10% of the UNI supply).

I agree that they are an intrinsic part of Uniswap, but why should they be able to voice their opinion, if they are not loyal and can change the DEX they provide their liquidity on at any time? UNI token holders have put their actual money as their vote, which acts as a great method of filtering opinions.  This isn\u2019t about voicing an opinion. Liquidity providers do this purely because of economical incentives. We\u2019ve seen this with sushiswap etc-  as soon as rewards dry up, they leave. So let\u2019s not make this about anything else. We should be focused on making uniswap the #1 DEX after free UNI incentives dry up. If uniswap remains the largest DEX - people will have interest to provide liquidity since they will earn part of the fees. ",

But in the context you mention loyalty; I think LPs would be far more interested in providing liquidity to Uniswap if they also knew they had a voice and that governors listened. This isn\u2019t about LPs taking over governance. This is about us - as responsible stewards of Uniswap - understanding the viewpoint of all stakeholders and aligning the platform in a way that benefits all (and thus capturing more value to UNI). I feel dismissing stakeholders (not least the most important stakeholders on the network) and looking at UNI price with blinkers on, is enormously risky when the goal is to establish a dominant DEX that captures value over the very long term.

Giving them some form of representation is definitely a good start, but more could be done. The Curve protocol might provide a good case study as they have recently started redirecting half of the trading fees away from LPs and toward CRV stakers. They did this without experiencing a significant drop in liquidity. The catch is that LPs are now entitled to receive CRV, so in a way, they can still get these fees by staking that CRV. Note: I\u2019m not saying that we should copy Curve, nor that Curve is the DEX gold standard. But they recently went through a similar process of taking fees away from LPs towards governance participants and it seems to have worked out for them (so far). ",
