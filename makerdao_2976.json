I personally spend a lot of time around here, and still have an hard time grasping the whole picture and keeping myself updated. After last week\u2019s poll outcomes (see thread), where even very involved members (and perhaps more importantly, voters!) might have not understood perfectly how the governance polls work, I had the following idea. What I did:  I took the liberty to contact the following youtuber (youtube link). He has a channel with more than 25k viewers about DeFI, and I find his videos extremely clear and well done. I asked him (email) if, under proper compensation, he would consider making some professional videos (similar to those in his channel) regarding: a) What is MakerDAO, how to open a CDP/Vaults, the associated benefit risks, fees, DSR, etc, b) Governance: how to vote, polls and executives votes, etc c) > MKR-token(omics), annual burn, Stability fees, surplus, MKR-burning, forum activity, etc   He kindly answered as follows:   Hi IamMeeoh, Thanks for reaching out. Just to clarify. Are you interested in these videos to be published on our channel? If that\u2019s the case, we usually don\u2019t offer sponsored reviews, mostly because the requests come from unknown projects. The idea of creating a video sponsored by basically the MakerDAO community grant looks quite interesting and I can clearly consider doing that. Best, Jakub  What I am asking in this forum poll: Would you agree to invest some of the money of the surplus (a MIP for spending this money is already available, but so far we have not used it) to pay the youtuber (Finematics) what is needed to produce high quality Youtube videos? Details, such  how much money? how to release these videos? How many videos? What format? What topics should be covered? when?  will be discussed, with the youtuber  (Finematics), if the poll ends with a majority of YES, before proceeding with the formal MIP to approve this.    Do you want to invest money from the surplus to make high quality Youtube videos explaining Governance (and other topics) to a large audience?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     ",

I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve seen our Youtube channel, but we have a few videos already for basic MakerDAO topics: Intro to MakerDAO series. There are a few more resources curated by the community on our awesome-makerdao. It could definitely use a brush up of more content! For some of the questions you asked, a good reference point might be one of the Community Development project: Few months ago @reuptaken and Tom created an English and Polish Oasis Vault walk through!. This was funded through a mini grant framework we use called Community Development Improvement Proposal (CDIP) -  CDIP 1 These took about 2 months to develop the script, revise for feedback, edit audio and video. He requested 1500 Dai for the first video and ended up spending about 3,500 Dai for one video. That being said, things to consider when it comes to developing and paying for content:  Will this age?: Interfaces or change/update quite a bit at Maker. It\u2019s good to keep this in mind when thinking of specific topics to cover (For example, the Oasis video is already outdated! or another example: DSSGov will change the \u201chow to vote\u201d process) Who will confirm the information is correct? This may delay time for production depending on feedback turnaround.  All in all, these types of projects are perfect for community grants! ",

I have no idea what is comparable, maybe someone can chime in who knows this business:  having 28k subscribers - is that a lot? the Aave/Compound-video hat less that 5k views - is that a lot?    It depends. If you compare with big YouTubers, it\u2019s not\u2026 I personally have a big problem with this metric. If you look at \u201cbig\u201d YouTubers or Crypto Tweeter (CT) some have a lot of followers, but when you start to look at the impact of their content, like views, likes \u2026 you are very often disappointed. Very often you see 50k followers CT, with 6 likes on their tweets. Even with 400 followers I have a better visibility. It\u2019s also good to keep in mind that it\u2019s super easy to buy followers. Short story: I\u2019m involved in several DAO, and few weeks ago a youtubeur open a proposal to ask 5k in order to make a video speaking about the project. And he said that it\u2019s a discounted price because he likes it\u2026blablabla\u2026 I was a bit shocked about the price and the way he did it. But the proposal was approved very quickly and apparently youtubeurs with +100k followers ask around 20k for a video ( and  it\u2019s ok, it\u2019s a \"good price). But I think it\u2019s also depend on what you want.  Target a very large audience, but 99% won\u2019t care and will never use it. (eg: 100k crypto youtubeur) Target a smaller audience, but with more potential users. (more specialized youtubeur, speaking sometimes about DeFi) -Target an even smaller audience but with a lot of potential new users (very specialized)  I have a website about crypto and I\u2019m trying to focus on DeFI. I don\u2019t have the biggest audience, but I can share with interested readers. I usually write 2 type of articles. Some guides, to present protocols, and tutorials, where step by step i show how to do. And people really like that. They can learn, and at the same time also understand how to join the protocol. It was already said, but I think you should first decide what you want to do exactly (tuto, articles \u2026). Then you need to decide the audience you are targeting. And then you need a nice way to share it. I also really like when the community propose things. You can do a contest like \u201cBest tutorial to open a CDP on maker\u201d. I\u2019m sure some  people here are very talented and will be happy to help and be involved.   Or you can have small grants, and people can apply. Big YouTubers usually don\u2019t care about the project, and they just want to make money. So as a community i think it\u2019s also important to know what you want. Involved the community are not PS: This is not against Finematics, I personally really like his/her videos  ",

Real world assets into crypto is an event worthy of considerable and potentially durable media attention. Personally I know absolutely nothing about marketing but I will be paying close attention and see who can spin that event the best.

And it will be up to them to assess and go through such promotions.   This is a very good point and there is currently a small working group in Community Development tackling this challenge. There is a Declaration of Intent for a Governance Communication working group that is focused on a system for communication between the DAO, DeFi community, and the public. Internal Communication Currently this working group focuses on communication projects that help keep stakeholders informed with the Maker Relay, a weekly governance recap, and Snippets a low-latency key summary of the G&R call. We also run a community twitter focusing on governance updates. One campaign profiled all the amazing new features of the new Gov Portal with animated gif walkthroughs. This is one way to expand the reach into a larger ecosystem (top of the marketing funnel, awareness stage, that helps nurture interest and bring people in) High quality educational media on YouTube is another great way to do that. External Communication I think producing educational media, interfacing with PR, and other community lead communication strategies are related to this. I\u2019m very interested in exploring and talking to anyone who has ideas on how we can improve community and governance communications. If you have any comments on that proposal, please leave any feedback!     Planet_X:  What is missing is the attempt to reach out into mainstream media, especially when Maker is soon opening up for real world assets. Real world assets into crypto is an event worthy of considerable and potentially durable media attention.   Agreed. It\u2019s important that we have processes in place so that we can take advantage of notable events like those and tap into larger media ecosystem. ",

One campaign profiled all the amazing new features of the new Gov Portal with animated gif walkthroughs.    I didn\u2019t know that account\u2026 It has 220 followers. The main Maker account has +73k followers.  The animated gif, has 4views !!! (3 before mine). I think you have a LOT to do in terms of communication. You already have some nice content but I never saw it\u2026 I\u2019m still new on this forum. But so far what I like:   This place is amazing. I think it\u2019s the best DAO I\u2019m following. Contents are incredible. People really spend time and go very deep. I\u2019m learning a lot. Mostly reading because it\u2019s hard for me to take part in some discussions as the \u201clevel\u201d is too high for my knowledge.   But on the other side, as a new member, it\u2019s very hard to find infos. Between the forum and the website there is a LOT of infos, but I personally struggle to find what I need. A simple example. I was wondering MKR stakers received reward for taking part during votes. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. But It doesn\u2019t seem to be the case right now. Right ?   The protocol is amazing and very well managed. But you maybe forgot new members and beginners on the way. It\u2019s hard to catch up. I think you should also create very simple content like \u201cELI5\u201d or others very simple tutorials (maybe it\u2019s already the case and i missed it). Based on feedbacks and traffic I have on my website, people really like tutorial and very simple explanations. On the other hand it will also bring less \u201ceducated people\u201d (in terms of knowledge of the project), so it can lower the quality of the forum. But it\u2019s also a balance between quality, and number of people involved in the DAO. ",

I guess what people are really asking is make MakerDAO like staple in global mainstream news. However, even right now, only Bitcoin and Ethereum fall in that category, and let\u2019s be honest, did they manage that by paying mainstream media? As size grew, it became natural for these news to pay more attention to them.

To all those who voted ABSTAIN: this was just a first informal poll. If YES wins, I will enter in contact with Finematics and (openly, in the forum) prepare a precise and detailed proposal which will have a subsequent formal poll. To those suggesting Marketing/Media Working Groups: absolutely, that would be fantastic (and some already exists!) But current working groups, as we know, are already full of work, so I guess it\u2019s good if community driven side-projects (outsourced to third parties) are launched. These can be (re-)assigned to a Working group whenever said group is ready to handle the additional work. ",

IMHO, it\u2019s a great idea to make high quality videos and walkthroughs, but I would not use the MIP14 process to fund it. Because parameters are in 10K increments and a transfer ceiling of 250K, my interpretation of MIP14 is it\u2019s structured for more meaningful, but perhaps temporary or one off work. While I think it\u2019s an amazing first step for the DAO to start paying for things, it can be funded through Community Development which has the grants infrastructure to fund smaller projects like this.

Then when there\u2019s more infrastructure for spending funds (ie. onboarding and hiring a marketing domain team), then the DAO.     swakya:  this level of granularity (ordering specific media production for the DAO) seems too fine for the governance-forum level. A marketing domain team with a budget would be able to execute on an idea like this a) faster b) with more expertise c) as part of a larger strategy they own. Getting a domain team in place sounds more like our job.   Yup totally agree with you here. Prioritization is really important. If it\u2019s immediate need or one-off, we can set up a grant. If we want to be more intentional and thoughtful, we should lean on the marketing or communications domain.     flipflopflapdelegate:  couple of Pods called \u201cMeet the Makers\u201d and \u201cTake the Maker 101\u201d hosted   I think this would be perfect for The Voice of MakerDAO podcast from @JerryAG!

I see your points, and I agree with them to a very large extent. I just feel that the path of  create a Media/Marketing team vote for it Run it initially by the Foundation Eventually give it to the DAO, etc  is pretty long and bureaucratic (@amyjung said, e.g., \u2018the next 3 months\u2019). It is certainly something that we need. So I am all in favour for the above steps. But I\u2019d also be happy if we could promote several small-ish working group popping up trying to accomplish several small/specific tasks without, necessarily, a central coordination. In other words:  It\u2019s definitely good to have a well-organised structure, vision, etc but would also be good to promote some kind of AGILE ENVIRONMENT, where stuff happens without the need of coordinating between several layers of bureaucratic complications.  In the specific case, I still think it would have been worth the DAO\u2019s money to invest a few kUSD on making a couple of videos with Finematics , just to see how it goes. Conclusion: This said, I think the discussion that arose in this thread is very interesting. I am now personally inclined to do the following:  Wait that the poll is finished Inform Finematics (the youtuber I contacted) about this thread, so that they know we have discussed the topic. Maybe Finematics can add their opinion, their will to cooperate in the future with MakerDAO, etc but I will personally not push this any further, at least for now (because there is no urgency to make Youtube videos), even if YES has ~36%, because I don\u2019t feel there is a sufficient support, due to so many ABSTAIN\u2019s.

The Foundation already has MarComms, and as @Anna pointed out, we currently have a Declaration of Intent / Working Group level of a communications community team who are interested in exploring this further. (Noted that Marketing and Communications are two different areas, but may share some overlap)     iammeeoh:  @amyjung said, e.g., \u2018the next 3 months\u2019)   Domains take time to develop and require nurturing, unless some team comes ready to tackle the entire thing. Even then, they need to put in a lot of work to develop a reputation in the community. My proposal for an \u201cagile\u201d environment in this sense is if the community wants to give a grant to make this video from Finematics to happen, we can do that through the Community Development Foundation grants. If you\u2019re looking for a marketing team, that should be nurtured and probably discussed in a separate manner. ",

Everything is well-organised, you have amazing content. Also, Maker and Dai is the \u201cbase\u201d of Defi. And unfortunately when you speak to people, they don\u2019t really know what is Maker\u2026 After my last message I spend some times trying to find infos. And I think you already have everything. I never saw this one for example: https://oasis.app/borrow     Anna:  What kind of content do you think would be the most helpful to a beginner? Are there any particular topics you wish were more covered aside from the example you mentioned?   Based on what I\u2019m doing, so only my personal experience. People are sometime very lazy and what work the best it something like that:  Small introduction of the project (very simple) Tuto step by step with screenshots      Doo:  I guess what people are really asking is make MakerDAO like staple in global mainstream news. However, even right now, only Bitcoin and Ethereum fall in that category, and let\u2019s be honest, did they manage that by paying mainstream media? As size grew, it became natural for these news to pay more attention to them. And I believe that will be the same case for Maker system (to clarify, reaching out to mainstream media is a good idea but paying them for exposure is questionable in my opinion).   Not sure about that. I think what people want to know, is why should they put their tokens on Maker  instated  of another protocol like Aave, Compound\u2026 So again I think you already have the content, and he is super nice. For exemple I really like this : https://twitter.com/MakerDAO/status/1327335078477774848 Can you do something similar to quickly explain what is Maker ? To sum up, I think that more than Media production you need a better communication. Example the Twitter account for the governance ! Only 220 followers. Why ? As I said before the video posted on this group is very nice but has only 3 views !!! It probably took hours to make it, and nobody sees it \u2026 And as I said in my first reply. You really need to know what is your target. I\u2019m not sure asking big YouTubers, will help. They are followed by newbies, and only want to share their referral links. I think you want \"smaller crypto \"influenceurs \u201c\u201d(really hate this word). Who will present the project properly, and can help users if needed, and create useful content. I personally really like contests, and content made by the community. For the DAO it\u2019s less work, you usually have amazing submission. You have free publicity, because people will share their work on social media. And community members are happy because they can help, and maybe win a prize. ",

E.g., what type of content they\u2019d might be interested to produce for us, how long, which platform will publish the videos, etc. In other words, what their \u2018offer(s)\u2019 could be.   What is the compensation, more or less of course, that they would ask. In usual business, of course, this is not a topic to discuss on a public forum. But MakerDAO is a DAO, and necessarily we need to see these numbers in public to have a proper discussion.   others\u2026   This thread can of course be extended with further insightful discussion.

For the sake of transparency, I copy it here:  Hi IamMeeoh, I\u2019ve read the whole thread - great to see the conversation going. It looks like the community wants to fund media production, but there is still a lot of unknowns. For example, it doesn\u2019t look like there is a consensus when it comes to the actual topics that should be covered and creators who should produce it. I\u2019m planning on creating a video on MakerDAO anyway as this is something that is missing from my basic DeFi explainers. I\u2019ll probably work on it in January. After that maybe you\u2019ll have more clarity when it comes to the type of content that the community wants to fund. Cheers, Jakub  So the message is positive. They are still going to produce MakerDAO related material. And are open towards possible interactions with us (Governance of MakerDAO) in the future, when we\u2019ll be more ready and organised. ",

Obviously no need to, but having them some speak to the Com-Dev or Gov-Coms groups might be pretty valuable and, I imagine, the quickest way to finding some productions if that\u2019s something we could reach a consensus on. As a channel clearly into the DeFi space I\u2019m sure tools we\u2019re using like SourceCred or our updated voting portal would be worthy of some exploration. ",
