                    "content": " MIP52: Dispute Resolution  Preamble MIP#: 52 Title: Dispute Resolution Author(s): Gregory Di Prisco (g_dip) Contributors: None Type: General Status: Formal Submission Date Proposed: 2021-05-04 Date Ratified: n/a Dependencies: MIP3c1 Replaces: n/a   Sentence Summary MIP52 outlines a process by which any community member or stakeholder can elevate the resolution of a dispute directly to MKR holders  Paragraph Summary This MIP outlines a process by which any community member or stakeholder can elevate the resolution of a dispute directly to MKR holders. There will be two primary components to this MIP, one which allows for the dispute to be settled in the normal governance cycle and another that permits for an immediate resolution, and a third component which sets a parameter for the immediate resolution component.  Component Summary MIP52c1: Standard Dispute Resolution This component outlines a process by which a community member or stakeholder can have the MKR holders vote on a binary outcome in the ratification polls of the monthly governance cycle. MIP52c2: Immediate Dispute Resolution This component outlines a process by which a community member or stakeholder can cause an immediate on-chain binary option poll in the next eligible weekly governance cycle. MIP52c3 - MI52c2 Burn Amount A parameter set by governance which specifies the amount of MKR that must be burned to utilize MIP52c2.  Motivation While bureaucracy and delegation of tasks is necessary to ensure the smooth operation of the DAO, all stakeholders should ultimately have recourse directly to MKR holders. As the DAO continues to add Core Units and add Mandated Actors, it is inevitable that a community member or stakeholder will disagree with a decision being made by these groups or individuals. This MIP will allow that community member or stakeholder appropriate recourse. This will also allow the MKR holders to have a process by which they can have their voices heard in any situation.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP52c1: Standard Dispute Resolution In the event that a community member or stakeholder disagrees with any action of the DAO, whether that action has been taken by a Core Unit, Mandated Actor, or any other person or group directly or indirectly elected by MKR holders (the \u201cOfficial DAO Members\u201d), this community member or stakeholder may use this MIP to call a vote which provides a binary outcome for MKR holders to determine. The language used by the community member or stakeholder must be structured as a yes or no question. Both parties involved must be given the opportunity to write their own language for the poll. The language in the poll itself should be limited to a number of characters set by the Governance Facilitator (and must be the same for both parties), but each party may provide a link to a forum post outlining a longer form argument. This question will then be presented to MKR holders in the ratification polls of the monthly governance cycle. The poll will resolve with a simple majority of MKR, but must meet the positive participation threshold for all Ratification polls. The outcome of the poll will be considered a binding resolution to the dispute. Any ambiguity in the outcome of a poll will be deferred to the judgement of the Governance Facilitators. Once the outcome of the dispute has been determined by MKR holders, any Official DAO Member that refuses to comply with the outcome shall be considered to be acting explicitly against the will of the MKR holders.  MIP52c2: Immediate Dispute Resolution Since certain circumstances are time sensitive, this component provides a path to immediately resolve a dispute. Please note that this component is separate from MIP5 and is not intended to be used in emergency situations. Since an immediate resolution causes friction and overhead to the DAO and MKR holders, there should be a cost associated with utilizing this component. To deter abuse and ensure a sufficiently high bar to utilize this component, the community member must burn a predetermined amount of MKR (the \u201cMIP52c2 Burn Amount\u201d). In order to avoid confusion, the address from which the MKR will be burned should be posted publicly in the forums before the MKR is destroyed. The community member or stakeholder shall burn the MKR by sending it to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 after posting a MIP52c2 subproposal which includes the address that will destroy the MKR. If there remains any doubt that the community member or stakeholder is in control of the address destroying the MKR, a Governance Facilitator may demand further proof of control by requesting the address to sign a message. Once the MKR is burned, the poll will be placed in the next eligible weekly cycle. In the event that a community member or stakeholder disagrees with any action of the DAO, whether that action has been taken by a Core Unit, Mandated Actor, or any other person or group directly or indirectly elected by MKR holders (the \u201cOfficial DAO Members\u201d), this community member or stakeholder may use this MIP to call a vote which provides a binary outcome for MKR holders to determine. The language used by the community member or stakeholder must be structured as a yes or no question. Both parties involved must be given the opportunity to write their own language for the poll. The language in the poll itself should be limited to a number of characters set by the Governance Facilitator (and must be the same for both parties), but each party may provide a link to a forum post outlining a longer form argument. This question will then be presented to MKR holders in the ratification polls of the monthly governance cycle. The poll will resolve with a simple majority of MKR, but must meet the positive participation threshold for all Ratification Polls. The outcome of the poll will be considered a binding resolution to the dispute. Any ambiguity in the outcome of a poll will be deferred to the judgement of the Governance Facilitators. Upon completion of the poll, the Governance Facilitators shall determine whether to return the burned MKR to the user of the MIP and, if choosing to do so, may include the transfer in the next eligible monthly governance cycle. Once the outcome of the dispute has been determined by MKR holders, any Official DAO Member that refuses to comply with the outcome shall be considered to be acting explicitly against the will of the MKR holders. MIP52c2 will override any calendar exceptions outlined in MIP3c4.  MIP52c3: MIP52c2 Burn Amount This component specifies the amount of MKR that a community member or stakeholder must burn in order to utilize MIP52c2. It is recommended that it be initially set to 10,000 Dai worth of MKR (at the previous day\u2019s price of MKR on Coinbase at 4:00pm EST) and can be modified via subproposal. MIP52c3 is a Process MIP component that allows the amendment of the burn amount in MIP52c2 If onboarded through a MIP52c3 subproposal, the amount and pricing mechanism are thereon utilized for the purposes of MIP52c2. MIP52c3 subproposals have the following parameters:   Feedback Period: 1 week  Frozen Period: 1 week  MIP52c3 subproposals must use the template located at MIP52c3-Subproposal-Template.md. This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status. ",

Suggestion Is it worth considering returning a percentage in the case of a successful outcome for the immediate path?  Example If someone in the community had 2x the Burn requirement, it would only make sense for them to intervene if not doing so would creator the MKR price by more than 50%.  Returning even just 25% of the MKR here would lower the cost/benefit for the above caller to a 37.5% expected drop in MKR price, while retaining the full opportunity cost for maliciously called disputes.  Reasoning If we wish to count on members to do the right thing when a situation is severe enough (but not necessarily going to heavily impact MKR price) having a rebate percentage not only lowers the calculus on the financial incentives for doing the right thing, but adds a social validation for making the \u201cright\u201d call. This would, in effect, lower the cost of immediate responses made in good faith while still keeping those made in bad faith at full cost. ",

Is it an individual/organization that holds MKR, or do you need to get certified as an \u201cOfficial\u201d? Usually in PoS networks such as Cosmos, Polkadot, etc., if a governance proposal is made by a Token Holder, he/she, or Entity must stake a specific amount of tokens, and if the proposal passes the Staked Tokens are returned, if it fails they are burned. I guess as an easy example, if an MKR holder dislike the fact that the BD Team was integrating DAI into the Costa Rican Government (as an odd & silly example), an Official DAO Member can dispute such? Is that an easy understanding of a basic scenario that can possibly occur? ",

I would like to raise several points that are unclear to me from the current formulation.     g_dip:  In the event that a community member or stakeholder disagrees with any action of the DAO, whether that action has been taken by a Core Unit, Mandated Actor, or any other person or group directly or indirectly elected by MKR holders (the \u201cOfficial DAO Members\u201d), this community member or stakeholder may use this MIP to call a vote which provides a binary outcome for MKR holders to determine. The language used by the community member or stakeholder must be structured as a yes or no question.   How do we resolve ambiguities and who should be responsible for doing so? In a decentralized system, every stakeholder is bound to have a varying perspective on any issue presented. And yet, we may only have good decision-making if we agree on the underlying concepts. It\u2019s for this reason that MIP0 states:  A MIP must not have equally valid conflicting interpretations. MIP Authors and MIP Editors must strive to reduce ambiguity. A MIP must be as clear and easy to understand as possible.  I would present the argument that an objective poll describing a dispute is impossible. Inherent bias while formulating complex issues into binary outcomes will prove to be a challenge for any party, no matter how well-willing, and thus also to the voter tasked with resolving such a dispute. My question is then, who will ensure the issue is well-presented and the outcome is based on valid assumptions?     g_dip:  Once the outcome of the dispute has been determined by MKR holders, any Official DAO Member that refuses to comply with the outcome shall be considered in breach of their mandate.   What does one\u2019s breach of mandate entail? Is it something more than shaking a finger at a facilitator? It seems to me we would still have to offboard them by using MIP41c5 in case they don\u2019t comply with the outcome. The instant resolution of the conflict is then in essence a non-binding waste of 100 MKR. While I do believe that a tool for dispute resolution could prove useful in the long run (I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ran into any major disputes yet), we might need to look for something more light-handed and with less governance overhead, or alternatively a tool for dispute resolution with more serious outcomes for the parties involved. I don\u2019t think we can easily get the advantages of both. ",

The premise of this MIP is that any stakeholder should have the ability to present a Yes or No question to the MKR holders. If the user of this MIP leaves ambiguity in the question, it will fall to the governance facilitator to direct the outcome. By the time someone is aggravated enough to use this MIP, I think they will remove any ambiguity from what they are looking to achieve. I\u2019d also encourage you to think about a scenario where two core units are in disagreement - a mechanism like this will be a \u201cneed to have\u201d not a \u201cnice to have\u201d should we wish to avoid a stalemate.     Elihu:  What does one\u2019s breach of mandate entail?   This is a great question and cuts to, in my opinion, the core of decentralized governance. There\u2019s really not anything that this MIP explicitly does in terms of punishment, and that is by design. But, if a person or unit is in breach of their mandate and the MKR holders have made it clear, it will likely compromise the credibility of governance itself should further action not be taken. This MIP will not presume to know what the appropriate further action should be, it just gives that further action a foot to stand on. ",

However if the goal is to cut down on Governance overhead, it might make sense to defer the decision to the Governance Facilitators. This can get problematic (especially considering I\u2019m suggesting it as someone who wants to be a Governance Facilitator), but I think can be solved with language like \u201cX will happen, provided the Governance Facilitators do not consider the passed resolution malicious or out of order.\u201d  Disparity of the current proposal Whales and early builders can get an expedited decision while everyone else has to wait a month. In order to align incentives perhaps there will always be an element of that, but without a rebate for a \u201cgood\u201d use of the immediate resolution option you not only have to rely on whales, but altruistic ones should an urgent situation arise. As @Elihu pointed out MIP41c5 allows for removing of a facilitator if that is the goal of a dispute, but that process takes at least 1 month as defined by the MIP. I believe we need quicker options with more nuance than only being able to call for removal. This MIP provides for both of those desires, but for a much smaller section of the community. If a community member has a dispute it\u2019s certainly easier to make the case to someone with that level MKR that they can get the tokens back if they think the community will agree with the resolution to the dispute.

The second component, which would be used rarely and only when an aggrieved party has some serious skin in the game (i.e. they \u201ccan not wait\u201d until the end of the month for a resolution and also cannot convince the governance facilitator that they deserve an immediate resolution), requires the user to burn MKR. They have no guarantee of getting this MKR back and can basically just ask nicely if they want it back. But I don\u2019t think we should be considering this second component with such complexity - it\u2019s a tax on impatience, not a game-theoretic solution to unfairness, the user has several other options to achieve resolution and is forcing the MKR holders to convene outside of the normal governance cycle.

I do see your point that it is much less cumbersome than an emergency poll though. Overall forcing skin in the game is fine and deciding on the ultimate fate of the bond at dispute resolution time or later is not very important unless I\u2019m missing something, so I\u2019ll stop bikeshedding and agree with the proposal with the caveat that the MKR does not go to 0x0 but to a contract that obeys governance and can send MKR back. The bond size can always be reduced to 0 later. ",

                    "content": "Hey Greg, will start off by saying I definitely think we need something along these lines. That said, I have some comments      g_dip:  The language used by the community member or stakeholder must be structured as a yes or no question.   So I agree completely on the binary nature of these, that makes sense. That said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to have the community member determine the contents of the poll itself, I worry that this will end up with polls that are presented as very one-sided issues, where the truth is likely to be more nuanced. There are a couple of options there.  Allow both parties to add their PoV to the poll (there should be a fairly strict word-count limit. Have the Governance Facilitator write the poll itself and present it as objectively as possible. Put very little information in the poll, and instead link to forum thread(s) in which the issue is debated.      g_dip:  This question will then be presented to MKR holders in the inclusion polls of the monthly governance cycle.   Inclusion polls are changing to \u2018Ratification Polls.\u2019 But otherwise this is doable.     g_dip:  nor must it meet any inclusion thresholds - a simple majority of MKR will determine the outcome.   Simple majority is fine, but there should be something similar to the positive participation threshold as proposed for Ratification Polls. Otherwise you risk a tiny amount of MKR swinging a poll that no one else wanted / was bothered to vote on.     g_dip:  The outcome of the poll will be considered a binding resolution to the dispute.   This is tricky, and potentially dangerous. What exactly is the poll author allowed to demand in terms of resolution? Like, is it reasonable to have a dispute poll lead to the immediate firing of a Core Unit, for example? As written this MIP leaves it a bit up in the air as to what the possible resolutions are to a dispute.     g_dip:  Once the outcome of the dispute has been determined by MKR holders, any Official DAO Member that refuses to comply with the outcome shall be considered in breach of their mandate.   Again, what does this mean in practice? I\u2019m sure I and others have breached our mandates accidently in the past, none of us are perfect. What does a \u2018breach of mandate\u2019 mean in this MIP? What actions does that trigger?     g_dip:  To deter abuse and ensure a sufficiently high bar to utilize this component, the community member must burn a predetermined amount of MKR (the \u201cMIP52c2 Burn Amount\u201d).   Might be easier to just leave spam-control up to Governance Facilitators. Realistically facilitators control the processes anyway, if a Governance Facilitator is refusing to put up a dispute that they disagree with that\u2019s already grounds for removal.     g_dip:  To deter abuse and ensure a sufficiently high bar to utilize this component, the community member must burn a predetermined amount of MKR (the \u201cMIP52c2 Burn Amount\u201d).   I would also suggest that you return the MKR in the event of the community member \u2018winning\u2019 the dispute. This is more or less how we handle stuff like the ESM, and should become common practice. You shouldn\u2019t be penalized for doing something the majority of MKR Holders end up agreeing with.     g_dip:  This question will then be presented to MKR holders in an on-chain poll that will have a duration of three days.   This should happen in the next weekly cycle, at the usual polling time, and this should be written into the MIP. I know this is intended to be immediate, but:  3 days isn\u2019t immediate enough to actually have much of an affect in an emergency. Larger holders already have trouble voting in 3 day long polls. Having 3 day long polls at times voters aren\u2019t expecting them is asking for minimal participation, which is not what you want when you\u2019re trying to resolve a dispute.      g_dip:  MIP52c2 will override any calendar exceptions outlined in MIP3c4.   I would rather this wasn\u2019t here, personally. There shouldn\u2019t be any regular governance actions happening to disagree with during the calendar exception periods. If there are, then they\u2019re likely to be emergency actions that need to be done swiftly. In the event MKR Holders disagree with the emergency measures, they can vote them down in whichever emergency executive takes place. In the event that Governance disagrees with a successful emergency action, dealing with the dispute probably doesn\u2019t need to be done in the immediate aftermath (presumably everyone involved will still be dealing with the emergency.)     g_dip:  MIP52c3: MIP52c2 Burn Amount   If this is a process component from which subproposals can be triggered, it requires a feedback and frozen period. I would also say it makes more sense to set this amount in dollars and require a dollar-denominated amount of MKR burned. Though again, I would recommend against using MKR burn as an anti-spam measure for governance processes of this nature. This is more or less why we have Governance Facilitators.      g_dip:  But, if a person or unit is in breach of their mandate and the MKR holders have made it clear, it will likely compromise the credibility of governance itself should further action not be taken. This MIP will not presume to know what the appropriate further action should be, it just gives that further action a foot to stand on.   Don\u2019t love this. It\u2019s basically saying \u2018breach of mandate means governance is invalid and someone should sort that out.\u2019 Someone needs to presume on appropriate further action. If you want to leave this strictly up to Governance Facilitators, then make that clear in the MIP. Alternatively, make it clear in the MIP what outcomes should be expected with a successful dispute. Otherwise you\u2019ll end up causing more confusion and issues if a dispute like this is successful.      g_dip:   Prioritization of collateral types by domain teams Quorum required to turn a Signal Request into an urgent on-chain vote Outcome of a poll that would change the stability fee on a collateral type    In what ways were existing governance process unsuitable for these situations, and how would this governance process have changed things? On 1: That was dealt with using a signal request, I\u2019m not sure having a dispute mechanism would have been easier? Indeed it would have taken longer to use the monthly cycle versus a signal request. On 2: This doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me. In almost all examples of us needing an urgent on-chain vote we have had less than 3 days to take an action. That\u2019s why we used the urgent process. Also, like how does this help in this situation? Also (assuming I\u2019m the one that set the quorum) and the outcome of the dispute is \u2018I set the quorum wrong\u2019 how do I fix that without being in breach of mandate? The urgent vote may have happened and that couldn\u2019t be easily reverted. On 3: Again, I don\u2019t think a 3 days dispute would have prevented the issues you\u2019re referring to, and I\u2019m not sure why putting up a dispute is more effective than just starting a signal request to reverse the decision (and optionally consider the facilitator in \u2018breach of mandate\u2019.) Like, we can\u2019t stop doing what we\u2019re doing while waiting for the dispute to resolve, which means it\u2019s always going to be used to send a message over decision-making after the decision has been made. In this case I\u2019m not sure how having a 3 day dispute process helps versus having a month long (or signal request length) process. ",

                    "content": "Thank you for the (as always) extensive feedback      LongForWisdom:  So I agree completely on the binary nature of these, that makes sense. That said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to have the community member determine the contents of the poll itself, I worry that this will end up with polls that are presented as very one-sided issues, where the truth is likely to be more nuanced. There are a couple of options there.  Allow both parties to add their PoV to the poll (there should be a fairly strict word-count limit. Have the Governance Facilitator write the poll itself and present it as objectively as possible. Put very little information in the poll, and instead link to forum thread(s) in which the issue is debated.    I\u2019d like to cross suggestion (2) off the list as it seems as though the governance facilitator themselves may be party to the dispute. As for the other two, I would lean towards a hybrid. I think (1) is a fair compromise considering (3) would struggle to remain binary, but (3) is likely necessary for additional context given the word count limit.     LongForWisdom:  Simple majority is fine, but there should be something similar to the positive participation threshold as proposed for Ratification Polls. Otherwise you risk a tiny amount of MKR swinging a poll that no one else wanted / was bothered to vote on.   Fine with this. Should I amend it in the MIP? If so, do you have a preference for a minimum threshold?     LongForWisdom:  This is tricky, and potentially dangerous. What exactly is the poll author allowed to demand in terms of resolution? Like, is it reasonable to have a dispute poll lead to the immediate firing of a Core Unit, for example? As written this MIP leaves it a bit up in the air as to what the possible resolutions are to a dispute.   I think I addressed this in another post but I can find it. The concept of \u201cbinding\u201d is very loose in the sense that no outcome of this MIP can ever achieve anything without the follow-on actions of the DAO. I consider it binding in that it should be very clear that those asked to act are now in breach of their mandate (which I see you address below and I\u2019ll reply in line).     LongForWisdom:  Again, what does this mean in practice? I\u2019m sure I and others have breached our mandates accidently in the past, none of us are perfect. What does a \u2018breach of mandate\u2019 mean in this MIP? What actions does that trigger?   A breach of mandate, in the specific context of this MIP, means that you are not abiding by the actions requested to you from the MKR holders. This is why the poll needs to be objective - if the author leaves any subjectivity as to the desired outcome, then they\u2019ll be deferring to the interpretation of the governance facilitator.     LongForWisdom:  Might be easier to just leave spam-control up to Governance Facilitators. Realistically facilitators control the processes anyway, if a Governance Facilitator is refusing to put up a dispute that they disagree with that\u2019s already grounds for removal   This is the exact scenario I am trying to avoid. I do not like how in the current system, disagreements with a core unit are ultimately resolved with \u201cwell if you don\u2019t like it, vote me out.\u201d The explicit purpose of this MIP is to put a check on the powers of DAO members by eliminating ambiguity in the desired outcome (by polling the MKR holders already). I think the ability to circumvent the governance facilitator in placing a poll is critical to the efficacy of the proposal, as once again I believe the governance facilitator may find themselves the counterparty of the dispute.     LongForWisdom:  I would also suggest that you return the MKR in the event of the community member \u2018winning\u2019 the dispute. This is more or less how we handle stuff like the ESM, and should become common practice. You shouldn\u2019t be penalized for doing something the majority of MKR Holders end up agreeing with.   I have no objection to leaving the return of funds at the discretion of the governance facilitator, but I wouldn\u2019t want it to be automatic and therefore expected. One should expect to never see this MKR again and can rely on the goodwill of the governance facilitator to get it back.     LongForWisdom:  This should happen in the next weekly cycle, at the usual polling time, and this should be written into the MIP. I know this is intended to be immediate, but:  3 days isn\u2019t immediate enough to actually have much of an affect in an emergency. Larger holders already have trouble voting in 3 day long polls. Having 3 day long polls at times voters aren\u2019t expecting them is asking for minimal participation, which is not what you want when you\u2019re trying to resolve a dispute.    This is fair, will integrate it.     LongForWisdom:  I would rather this wasn\u2019t here, personally. There shouldn\u2019t be any regular governance actions happening to disagree with during the calendar exception periods. If there are, then they\u2019re likely to be emergency actions that need to be done swiftly. In the event MKR Holders disagree with the emergency measures, they can vote them down in whichever emergency executive takes place. In the event that Governance disagrees with a successful emergency action, dealing with the dispute probably doesn\u2019t need to be done in the immediate aftermath (presumably everyone involved will still be dealing with the emergency.)   The goal of the burn amount is to create a sufficient deterrent to using this MIP for \u201cimmediate\u201d recourse. But some things, that the governance facilitator may not find critical, are critical to other parties. Again, this is more in line with having a concrete way to bypass the governance facilitator. I don\u2019t think there should be any limitations on it as it can be increasingly diluted if that happens. [quote=\u201cLongForWisdom, post:37, topic:7845\u201d] If this is a process component from which subproposals can be triggered, it requires a feedback and frozen period. Can you elaborate?     LongForWisdom:  I would also say it makes more sense to set this amount in dollars and require a dollar-denominated amount of MKR burned.   Agreed, will integrate.     LongForWisdom:  Don\u2019t love this. It\u2019s basically saying \u2018breach of mandate means governance is invalid and someone should sort that out.\u2019 Someone needs to presume on appropriate further action. If you want to leave this strictly up to Governance Facilitators, then make that clear in the MIP. Alternatively, make it clear in the MIP what outcomes should be expected with a successful dispute. Otherwise you\u2019ll end up causing more confusion and issues if a dispute like this is successful.   I think you might be overthinking it. Any ambiguity is explicitly left to the governance facilitator. So I feel this is already covered?     LongForWisdom:  On 1: That was dealt with using a signal request, I\u2019m not sure having a dispute mechanism would have been easier? Indeed it would have taken longer to use the monthly cycle versus a signal request.   If I recall, this signal request did not produce the result the party wanted as the dev team just told them \u201cthanks for the feedback but we have our own prioritization framework\u201d. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s a good example of the process not working. If this MIP were used, it would have been the next collateral type onboarded and it would have been binding (as defined above).     LongForWisdom:  On 2: This doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me. In almost all examples of us needing an urgent on-chain vote we have had less than 3 days to take an action. That\u2019s why we used the urgent process. Also, like how does this help in this situation? Also (assuming I\u2019m the one that set the quorum) and the outcome of the dispute is \u2018I set the quorum wrong\u2019 how do I fix that without being in breach of mandate? The urgent vote may have happened and that couldn\u2019t be easily reverted.   Perhaps it\u2019s a bad example. In this proposal the window was 3 days, so if the urgent request was 5 days this would have worked, but I am making changes that nullify this based on your other comments.     LongForWisdom:  On 3: Again, I don\u2019t think a 3 days dispute would have prevented the issues you\u2019re referring to, and I\u2019m not sure why putting up a dispute is more effective than just starting a signal request to reverse the decision (and optionally consider the facilitator in \u2018breach of mandate\u2019.) Like, we can\u2019t stop doing what we\u2019re doing while waiting for the dispute to resolve, which means it\u2019s always going to be used to send a message over decision-making after the decision has been made. In this case I\u2019m not sure how having a 3 day dispute process helps versus having a month long (or signal request length) process.   I\u2019m referring to when Cyrus wanted the USDC rates lowered. In this case I agreed with your decision, but I do think Cyrus may have elected to use the second component of this MIP (which as drafted would have resolved the issue in three days and likely saved a significant amount of his principal).

I think you may have misunderstood me here. Governance Facilitators control what polls go up on the frontend. You can\u2019t get around this without either:  Replacing the frontend Convincing tech-ops that the Governance Facilitator has gone rogue.  Just saying \u2018The Governance Facilitator must put this poll up as directed\u2019 doesn\u2019t solve for the situation where there is a malicious Governance Facilitator. The situation where the Governance Facilitator refuses to put up a non-spam dispute poll when they themselves are one of the parties, is a malicious governance facilitator and they should not remain in their position. I agree we want to avoid the \u2018if you don\u2019t like it, vote me out\u2019 where possible, but if the Governance Facilitator is refusing to put up and honour valid dispute polls, then you need to remove them immediately, there is no middle ground there.     g_dip:  I have no objection to leaving the return of funds at the discretion of the governance facilitator, but I wouldn\u2019t want it to be automatic and therefore expected.   I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right way to go about this. It should be expected that disputing parties get their MKR back if they have a valid dispute. The expectation should be that if the dispute is upheld then the MKR is returned.     g_dip:  Again, this is more in line with having a concrete way to bypass the governance facilitator.

Any ambiguity is explicitly left to the governance facilitator. So I feel this is already covered?   Technically yes, but it makes my life a lot easier if I can point to a MIP that says \u2018Yes the Governance Facilitator deals with confusion or ambiguity in this situation.\u2019     g_dip:  If I recall, this signal request did not produce the result the party wanted as the dev team just told them \u201cthanks for the feedback but we have our own prioritization framework\u201d.

The response was more along the lines of \u2018yes we have our own prioritization framework, but, message received we\u2019ll push up RWA\u2019 The signal in question directly led to SIXs and NS-DROP becoming a priority.     g_dip:  If this MIP were used, it would have been the next collateral type onboarded and it would have been binding (as defined above).   What? The MIP doesn\u2019t define that at all. Does \u2018please prioritize RWA\u2019 in a binding form become \u2018The next collateral you onboard must be RWA\u2019, who decides that? That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying it needs to be more explicit. Also, the original onboarding MIPs explicitly give the domain teams decision-making power over which collaterals they work on, which rolls back around to the \u2018breach of mandate\u2019 thing.     g_dip:  I\u2019m referring to when Cyrus wanted the USDC rates lowered. In this case I agreed with your decision, but I do think Cyrus may have elected to use the second component of this MIP (which as drafted would have resolved the issue in three days and likely saved a significant amount of his principal).   Mmm, that\u2019s sort of what I mean though. I don\u2019t think the emergency version would have helped him much because any parameter change wouldn\u2019t have materialized within 3 days. The time-to-implementation is still pretty long.  +1 to 3 days waiting for the next weekly cycle. +3 days polling. +1 day for exec to be written. +x days for executive to pass. +2 days for GSM delay.  Like, it would have been faster to use the urgent signal functionality, which already exists (though that comes with the caveat that you need to get it past the community in addition to MKR Holders). I\u2019m not sure if that functionality existed at the time.  In conclusion it feels like we\u2019re missing two things:  The ability for anyone to put up MKR polls without going through the governance facilitator (though we probably don\u2019t want this on the main governance portal). A general purpose framework for objecting to decisions made by Core Units or elected actors.  I\u2019m hoping we can bring snapshot online for #1 (which is in the works). I think that this MIP is already pretty close to solving #2, so I\u2019m really happy you proposed it. Its worth considering we can modify the process as we see it work as well, the MIP can be amended in the future if necessary, so it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect first time. ",

I think snapshot will solve for this issue more cleanly, but I think this is fine in the meantime. I wanted to clarify intent, and it looks like we\u2019re on the same page.     g_dip:  Sorry I still don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Do I need to do something to this MIP to be compliant?   Depends on your intent. Let me grab an example. So here. You see this:     MIP7c3:  MIP7c3 is a Process MIP component that allows the onboarding of a domain team using a subproposal. If onboarded through a MIP7c3 subproposal, the domain team is added to the The Current Domain Team Roles list defined in MIP7c2 by a MIP Editor. MIP7c3 subproposals have the following parameters:   Feedback Period: 3 months  Frozen Period: 1 month  MIP7c3 subproposals must use the template located at MIP7c3-Subproposal-Template.md. This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status.   If you want to make this explicitly a process component, you need something like the above. Otherwise the MIP can still be modified, but it requires an amendment using MIP4. The advantage to making it it\u2019s own subproposal is that it signals to governance that the subproposal is only affecting stuff related to this MIP, whereas an amendment subproposal under MIP4 can modify any MIP. This means it\u2019s reasonably safe for MKR Holders that don\u2019t care about this dispute process to ignore an amendment to the MKR burn amount if it\u2019s defined in this MIP. It\u2019s never safe for MKR Token Holders to ignore a subproposal under MIP4.     g_dip:  there was no MIP to send an explicit Signal that the (at the time) domain teams were overtly acting against the will of the MKR holders. I am saying that there\u2019s currently ambiguity around the expectations of core units to comply with the will of MKR holders - this MIP removes that ambiguity.   I appreciate the intent here, but I do worry that this is an ambiguity that\u2019s actually helpful. I don\u2019t think that Core Units currently feel like they are required to comply with the will of MKR Holders, and moreover, I\u2019m not sure that they should. To take the example we were talking about, would it have benefitted to signal unequivocally to domain teams that they\u2019d done something wrong? What did they do wrong in this scenario? Because in my mind, absent signals from governance to the contrary, the only thing anyone did wrong in this scenario was to prioritize differently from an (uncommunicated) set of priorities held by MKR Holders. If you start calling people out for this, everyone will be reluctant to show initiative in the future. I would say it\u2019s much easier for people to throw up disputes after the fact, and second guess decisions made by Core Units, but ultimately Core Units are making those decisions because they haven\u2019t received prior guidance / instruction from MKR Holders. I don\u2019t feel that the RWA prioritization signal was an example of bad governance.  MKR Holders determined that they had a priority that hadn\u2019t been expressed, they expressed the priority, and Core Units prioritized the thing. So, in conclusion, I\u2019m slightly worried that this process will end up being misused to communicate priorities after the fact when they should have been communicated beforehand. Also concerned that it\u2019ll be used to tie hands, for example: \u2018force\u2019 Core units to do Y immediately, which gets you Y slightly faster, but also delays X and Z with the aggregate result being that everything takes longer than X, Y and Z would have if done in the originally planned order.

Yes, this is the core issue at play. As we become increasingly more dependent on Core Units, I worry that MKR holders will lose control they currently believe they have. Perhaps that\u2019s what some MKR holders want and perhaps it\u2019s even better for the DAO as a whole, and if they feel that way they should reject this MIP. Personally, I think MKR holders need total control over the DAO and I think that this MIP offers a nice middle ground between Core Unit independence and micromanagement. ",
