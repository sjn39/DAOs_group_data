                    "content": "EIP-1559 sole purpose is to make stakers more money, while creating a fake deflationary system (burning fees) to cover the stakers inflation of ETH (~8%). The only reason they are so against the miners is because miners are taking the profit away from stakers, stakers don\u2019t want to wait for ETH2, they want more profits now. I also feel its very hypocritical to talk about miners and inflation, while they have no concern whatsoever by giving stakers 8%, this will severely inflate the system, burning fees is just a gimmick to cover the fact of this inflation. EIP-1559 is solely designed for stakers and their profits, nothing more, nothing less. Looks like big money has officially taken over Ethereum, every future push will be to strictly benefit stakers and their returns. ",
