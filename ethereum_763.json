Technical acceptance is defined as:  there are no \u201cover my dead body\u201d objections by Core Devs in the discussion typically GitHub Issue or EthMagicians thread as the discussion location and, an EIP has been added to the agenda of a Core Devs call (Ethereum/PM GitHub issue) and there haven\u2019t been any remaining technical issues raised and there is a commitment to write/merge code in clients  For now, the Istanbul Roadmap Page on the Ethereum wiki has a list of proposed EIPs for the Istanbul hard fork https://en.ethereum.wiki/roadmap/istanbul \u2014 this link is included as an example of upcoming EIPs.

                    "content": "In response to the specific question, I think \u201ccontentious review\u201d happens sort of incidentally currently. First of all, the Core Devs call is open to anyone to sign up and join the discussion to talk about an issue. It\u2019s sort of the \u201cpublic hearing\u201d of Ethereum\u2019s governance. If we get any active dissent in the call from someone who does not typically join, this is where we hear it out. On the other hand, most people are quite busy and cannot attend these calls. The Core Devs (and this doesn\u2019t really reflect any particular person\u2019s job at the moment) summarizes the discussion in the forum threads and take it under consideration. If the dissent makes sense to them, they might discuss it during the call. Their own dissent may fall under this category too. It\u2019s a very fuzzy process, but they try to account for things that affect implementation of the proposal, including non-technical things like \u201ccommunity sentiment\u201d. If there are no known dissent that the participants, especially the client developers, deem to be a blocker to the implementation, a decision to move forward is made.  I think documenting how this system works by analyzing old calls and proposals would help document the process. We could draw clear parallels between this political process and other political processes across the world and look for opportunities for improvement and avoidance of capture. For one, I think formalizing the Core Devs call as a sort of \u201cpublic hearing\u201d may help formalize things a bit. There are many parallels to a public hearing. There is a chairman of the discussion (@souptacular), there are the \u201clawmakers\u201d (aka client devs and other interested parties), there are people who sign up to deliver public remarks. It gets recorded and documented for others to reference. I think there is a clear parallel. Typically, in public hearings nothing gets \u201cDecided\u201d, it\u2019s just everyone\u2019s voice is heard. Perhaps what could be done is we could optimize for that, and then more contentious discussion of whether or not to implement to a different chat that gets deliberated with something like Chatham House rules so Core Devs feel more free to voice their concerns and the concerns of others without feeling targeted. This might improve things.  However, it is usually lawmakers that participate in these public hearings as the central figures. They are elected officials, whose time to hear out the discussion is paid for by the people they represent. We have a different system. The Core Devs call is made up of people from EF who have various capacities they speak to, client developers whose time is paid for by their respective employers and who obviously implement the discussion, and whomever signs up to discuss an issue. We\u2019re not necessarily getting a representative sample of key stakeholder concerns, and we\u2019re not getting detailed analysis from parties who may raise more legitimate issues with a proposal (such as security professionals and \u201ccrypto-economists\u201d if I might use that term loosely). This is because people are too busy to attend the often 2hr+ call, and it would be volunteering so no one wants to do that either. The wider governance is such that this harm is mitigated a little bit, although definitely not in an optimal way. In the end, full node operators specify what the network is by \u201cvoting\u201d with their node whether or not to operate a particular software upgrade. Some nodes have more of a say than others. Mining pool operators, exchanges, and infrastructure operators all have a real legitimate say on the final state of the network, but at the expense of causing a contentious fork (which everyone wants to avoid). Adding a signaling mechanic for full nodes (e.g. an eth_vote(EIP) -> bool API endpoint) and random-sample querying nodes over a relevant period of time (1 month might be enough to make \u201cvoting\u201d by sybil nodes overly costly) might be enough to gauge sentiment of what is the final layer of Ethereum\u2019s governance. Node \u201creputation\u201d could be leveraged as well in help to filter these results. We might know which of these nodes are operated by those key parties mentioned above. We can use uptime and endpoint access metrics to determine the \u201csybil-ness\u201d of nodes who choose to remain anonymous. Everyone in the community could vote in this way, and we help the ensure the security of the network as well in the process. This is just one concept, but every single proposal for how to deal with Ethereum\u2019s governance requires a method of voting by \u201ckey stakeholders\u201d, so we\u2019ll have to do something like this eventually.  Who is willing to put time into figuring this out? That is the toughest question. We are all busy and so far these type of analytics has been an unpaid and thankless job. Those with an interest in making core governance stronger should fund efforts to make it so, but these kind of wishy-washy statements from onlookers like myself are why nothing every happens. I don\u2019t know how to solve that. ",

Are the changes proposed technically sound, and will they improve the functioning of the network and/or improve the health of the network?   The Ethereum Core Developers develop and manage a technical platform and service.  Like all service providers we must remain reasonably neutral among the users of our service, and thus relatively narrow in the considerations that are relevant to our deliberations.  Where an issue cannot be presented in technical terms, even as broadly stated as \u201cthe health of the network,\u201d  I think the Core Devs are simply not equipped to make a decision. The review that matters to the Core Devs is finalized as a consensus in the AllCoreDevs call.  Reaching consensus on contentious issues is difficult enough.  Contention that occurs after consensus in is reached is nearly impossible to deal with.  So it seems essential to reduce contention by participate in the process before proposals get to the core devs, including the discussion and Last Call process. One way to participate\u2013and perhaps the best way to present issues to the Core Devs in a form we can take action on\u2013is to prepare an Ethereum Improvement Proposal.

Then when it got pushed up to the core devs, no clear decision was made and no clear process was followed for making a decision on it. This is what EIP authors have to look forward to right now, a lot of hard work followed by an undefined process for decision making and no clear decision as the outcome.  This is certainly not incentive compatible with encouraging people to write good EIPs, it instead incentivizes people to first try to radicalize the community or have backdoor conversations with core devs to get a feel for how the undefined process will go prior to putting in the effort. With a well defined process for deciding what goes into clients, EIP authors have a chance at being able to predict the outcome before they sink a ton of time into the project.  If their prediction is that it will go through, then they can dedicate the effort to do all of the work. ",

One reason is that, while not all decisions are purely technical, nearly all important decisions have at least a substantial technical component. Another is that, while most of us, myself included, would prefer something more closely resembling a democracy, that is simply not possible unless and until we have a more formalized conception of identity, which we\u2019re nowhere near close to. The core devs should establish a steering committee. This would be off-chain but a little more formalized than core devs and would have a mandate of deciding on these more contentious questions. I envision seven or nine people who are trusted, who have a strong technical understanding of the protocol, representing most or all of the largest groups of stakeholders, and including experts in relevant areas such as economics, philosophy, governance/political philosophy, ethics, law, etc. (or with the resources and mandate to call in experts as necessary). Yes, it may be hard to assemble such a group but I believe it\u2019s possible. They should rotate often, every year or so. And it should be an \u201copt in\u201d process whereby the core devs refer individual issues that they don\u2019t want to decide on.  There are 1000 ways you could poke holes in these ideas and I encourage you to do so, but please be constructive and offer alternative ideas. No, this won\u2019t please everyone but I believe it\u2019s a workable proposal. ",

What I would like to see is a person or group who is willing to make decisions even when they are contentious.  Someone or some group who will stand up and say, \u201cwe have heard the arguments from all sides and we are going to do (or not do) X\u201d.  This person or group needs to be respected enough by the core developers such that when a decision is made, the core developers will strongly prefer following it over \u201cdo nothing\u201d (of course, they still retain veto power).

What I keep calling for is more self-organization of communities of users and operators, and more discussion within and across communities.  I think the Magicians have shown how that can work. That could reduce the amount of contention in the first place, and focus remaining contention into arguments that the Core Devs can actually deliberate. But in the end the Core Devs have to decide what software goes into the next fork, and the community takes a huge risk not to follow.  I don\u2019t know that we can avoid that responsibility. ",

Unfortunately some fairly significant parts of the development tooling ecosystem (myself included, at the time) weren\u2019t aware that this change was coming and only learned of it when our users (Dapp developers) complained that web3 was erroring when initialized with providers that hadn\u2019t yet been updated for the change. This issue is water under the bridge as far as I\u2019m concerned (major appreciation to @nivida for this!), but I think it\u2019s worth looking at in a retrospective context as a case where contentious review happened after the point at which the lack of such review would impact the community, and a case where unknown unknowns (e.g. how providers are used by web3, who produces these providers, and how much of the community consumes them) caused a fairly significant disruption to the development community.
