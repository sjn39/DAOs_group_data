I\u2019ve been interested in the blockchain space for a while, but never had the time to dig deeper. I thought the best and most fun way to do this would be by picking up a small project, creating a lot, and getting feedback through it.  Do you know anyone who\u2019s looking for design help? ",

However, some proposals and discussions would have UI / UX implications, and might benefit from design brainstorming and prototyping. For example, this ERC-3450 proposal by @dstreit; this is cryptography-related, but has UI implications because it helps users secure their funds from key loss. Maybe the proposal could use some UI mockups or a demo. To get into the weeds: ERC-3450 is a standard way to split a BIP39 mnemonic / word phrase into another set of mnemonics which can then be distributed to other parties for safe-keeping. Later, a predetermined number of them could be brought together to reproduce the original BIP39 mnemonic / word phrase. Check out the JS module implementation: danielstreit/shamir-bip39 ",
