Abstract This ring intends to create several structures for the community members to preserve their integrity and others. We choose the word \u201cintegrity\u201d because we believe that either physical or mental, this is the most essential thing to preserve in a person. This is, by all means, a more \u201chumanistic\u201d EIP. Ethereum has been scaling and the community growing, and a CoC will help teams to be better equipped when needing to react to adverse situations. Rings will exist in two types:  Fields : Created to gather expertise and interested parties around a specific unifying Topic and designed to be non-expiring. (E.g. Cyberbullying, Doxxing) Working Groups : Created to address a specific problem or to produce one or more specific deliverables (Code of Conduct, Protocol for Victim Protection) and is ephemeral by design. (I.e. will dissolve upon completion of its goals and achievement of its objectives.)  It is expected that membership intermingles among Fields and that from Fields Working groups be formed and reformed as needed. These Rings can also be called upon to scale the Core Devs process, as it is understood that the necessary experts and interested parties have been gathered together and done work before approaching the Last Call process. Additionally, over time, high-quality Rings can be called upon for comment or expertise, rather than all Core Devs needing to be experts in all topical areas. Motivation See above.

Building a network of teams able to connect to prevent limit situations that might affect a person\u2019s integrity. Building prevention protocols to educate more people coming into the space, and those already present. Coordinating actions when the CoC is breached, especially if the most serious breaches occur.
