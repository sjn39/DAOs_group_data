I bought eMax, and uniswap bought the wrong version of this (guess its the old version) It shows up in trust wallet with an icon that says \u2018deprecated coin do not use\u2019 When buying it in uniswap i typed in eMax, and the correct looking coin popped up.(red diamond in a blue circle) and everything looked fine. I cant figure out how to move what i bought from the wong eMax to the right one (red diamond in a blue circle) in trust wallet\u2026im new at this and how things like this happen mystify me?? Shouldnt uniswap remove old icons or tokens of the same name so things like this dont happen. It also says that i have $50k of this wrong eMax\u2026odd when i only bought $200 worth\u2026very confused. Edit\u2026 Figured out that i chose the old icon in uniswap\u2026traded them back so all is good now. In the future ill copy the contract address into uniswap so it knows exactly what coin i want and not rely on uniswaps search. ",

You probably can try to same, or maybe even convert from EMAX to eMax directly that just came to my head, you will only pay fee once. There is still problem with a leftovers that are in my wallet and not sure how to deal with that. My preference would be a to erase it completely from the wallet without any trace. Hope this helps.

I am facing this issue with this token. Can this kind of scam be stopped on Uniswap? Because It is very strange that there is only one way not other, then what is the meaning of SWAP if one can\u2019t swap his token in ETH back. I can understand we should do our own research about a token. but it doesn\u2019t mean that Uniswap allows this kind of blatant theft by only allowing to buy a token and not sell. Please help.
