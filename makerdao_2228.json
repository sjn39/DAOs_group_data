Instead I will be talking about the long term vision of Endgame v4 at the call tomorrow, same time. There are a lot of final pieces of the puzzle that have been coming together and I\u2019m excited to share this stuff, because it will be the starting point for all the details and decisions we\u2019ll have to flesh out over the Pregame. Topics will include:  Maker Rollup/Multichain compatible L1 Using AI and large language models to simplify governance accessibility, verify workforce results and project negotiations and decisions, and grow/\u201cpopulate\u201d/market SubDAOs Rebranding for Endgame and preparing an educational campaign Tokenomics changes, including Dai rewards from the Sagittarius Engine as the next step of the technical roadmap (this will mean large scale voter incentives arrive sooner) Reduced ossification of the constitution - with some changes to the design of the voter incentives, and through large scale leveraging of AI to power governance processes and make them more accessible and intelligent, I believe we can achieve a more desirable long term governance equilibrium where small, sensible adjustments to the Maker Constitution are feasible, and won\u2019t cause dangerous misalignment risk.
