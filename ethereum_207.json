Built it because as I was designing for a DAO certain web2 design patterns didn\u2019t make sense for the blockchain, and I ended up having 5 dApps open just to check how the UX of depositing liquidity worked. This is for designers and devs alike. If you guys want to help improve the state of UX of crypto, can I ask that you:  Use the site Suggest dApps that I can add to the library Spread the word Support the site by being a paying subscriber in the future Suggest ways for it to be improved     Yep.so    Yep.so Build landings pages that convert in 15 minutes.      Thanks a lot. ",
