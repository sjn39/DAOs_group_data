Please come with governance-related questions or topics in mind!  I feel like there are a couple of advantages to running a more informal, drop-in style meeting like this.  It should provide people within MakerDAO a less intense venue in which to ask questions and to learn about how governance works. The nature of the questions (particularly repeating questions from multiple sources) should help me figure out what content we need to cover as a priority in written governance documentation. It will hopefully help to increase governance participation and widen the pool of people that might be interested in working for MakerDAO on a formal or informal basis. It may help me to identify individuals interested in taking more of a role in the governance process.   ",

Let\u2019s try another way.  Here are the questions, you tell me how I can best find the answers:  When will dss-gov-rewards be implemented? Will we be able to vote on how much MKR can be locked into these interest-bearing accounts? Will we be able to vote on the yield rate for these accounts? For MKR to be a profitable investment the market cap of DAI would need to exceed 5x the market cap of MKR. When do you believe this will happen? Since the time of ETH Denver in 2020 MKR holders have lost 70% of their value measured in ETH. Over the last 8 months holding MKR as an investment has equated to shorting ETH. This trend is only likely to continue in the coming year as the probability ETH will exceed 2,000 USD increases. PART 1: What is the narrative going forward for holding MKR? PART 2: Why should investors not sell MKR now and cut their losses?  ",

                    "content": "@LongForWisdom this time was very valuable, thank you.  In summary, this is what I learned:  Implementation of dss-gov-rewards is greater than 60 days out. There is a greater priority in the developer community to create new collateral types than there is for implementing any form of yield for MKR holders. Being long on the value of MKR doesn\u2019t make sense if ETH goes to 2,000 by the end of 2021 because there is no mechanism for guarding against loss in that scenario because holding MKR is effectively a short against ETH. Threats in the medium term from regulation or changes in market conditions provide disincentives over waiting for a long term yield from the value of MKR increasing.  Whatever narrative developers have in their minds is not adequately factoring in this cost. Although some models could show providing a yield of 12% would terminate the incentive to short MKR using AAVE and could potentially remove a large amount of MKR from the market thus stemming the hemorrhaging of the MKR price the community prioritizes burn over yield because they have a narrative that does not take into account risks in the medium term.
