An inconvenience still remains that the liquidity needs to be withdrawn manually after the market price moves across the liquidity range or it could get swapped back again if the price retraces. Is there a reasonable gas cost method of flagging a liquidity provision as a limit order and only allowing it to participate in trades that are one direction. Whenever a trade currently happens it is already counterpartied with a list of valid LPs where the validity is determined by their range. If outside the range, it is not part of the trade. Can the same be done directionally only allowing the liquidity to be active for swaps in the desired direction thereby also updating the backend to make limit orders? ",
