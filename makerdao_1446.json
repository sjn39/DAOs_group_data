A key element of the Endgame Plan is that these features must be described with as much detail and context as possible, and as early as possible, since this helps ossify the Endgame state and decrease  the likelihood that things will change once the Endgame Plan has been launched. At the same time, the product roadmap will of course never be 100% immutable, as very strong ideas or obvious flaws can of course be implemented or changed if there is a very good reason to do so. But the key is to reach a point where changes only happen for very good reasons, minimizing or eliminating the possibility that control of the protocol scope becomes a tool of political contention and power grabs, or leads the protocol towards fundamentally changing its focus away from securing the Dai Stablecoin, which would potentially put users savings at increased risk. Because the product roadmap needs to ossify as quickly as possible, and must aim to describe the entire future scope of the Maker Protocol, the features need to be highly future proofed and remain long term relevant. This necessitates that the community considers very advanced designs up front - before ossification - while it is still possible to iterate and change them, as whatever ossifies in the short run is what the protocol ends up getting permanently. The advantage is that there are no resource or time constraints on these designs, as the community can take as long as it takes to develop all elements of the Product Roadmap as long as their details are agreed on and well understood enough to a point where over time their designs and specifications can improve unambiguously without resulting in governance disputes. This approach provides a unique opportunity for Maker, which already has massive network effects and resources, but has still not ossified to the point where it cannot introduce and plan for new, advanced, future-proofed designs. The goal of the Endgame Plan Product Roadmap is that the Maker protocol will be able to build up long term, large scale network effects and momentum for core products that will remain competitive with the designs future startups and innovative projects that are not constrained by the ossification and inertia of true decentralization.  image3032\u00d71824 492 KB  The Endgame Plan Product Roadmap uses a unique timeline framework that attempts to deal with the uncertainty around long term planning of smart contract development, and the way priorities have to shift based on external events and market dynamics. Instead of making a linear, chronological list or predicting specific timeframes of months/years, a system of very broad chronological phases is used. The basic logic is that all features of an earlier phase must be completed before work on a later phase can begin at full scale. For the most part, all products from all phases are integral to the Endgame Plan Product Roadmap and must be completed, but there are a few exceptions where some products can be skipped entirely. Overall, the roadmap is split into 4 parts: Pregame, Early Game, Midgame and Endgame  Pregame Pregame products denotes the products that must be in place before the Endgame Plan Launch can happen, and are low cost, high impact products that can be developed quickly by reusing as many pieces from the broader DeFi ecosystem as possible in order to maximize the generation of short term momentum during the early stages of the Endgame Plan.  Early Game Early Game products are simple products that follow the same logic as the Pregame Products of being optimized for easy development and high impact, but are not developed and launched until after the Endgame Plan Launch, using \u201cfast-follow\u201d tactics. If resources and prioritization permits, some Early Game products may be built before the Endgame Plan Launch, and then launch alongside the Pregame Products, but they are not prerequisites for the Endgame Plan Launch. Early Game Products are generally the only Products in the Endgame Plan Product Roadmap that can be skipped.  Midgame Midgame Products are the most important new innovations built by the Maker ecosystem. They are completely new primitives and long term efficient building blocks unique to the Endgame Plan. Their completion allows Maker to sustainably capture the momentum and network effects that the Endgame Plan Launch builds up with its easy and high impact products. The Midgame products likely won\u2019t be developed until several years following the Endgame Plan Launch. The Midgame products will be the first products to be developed through the Creator Quest framework for a more patient and transparent development process that provides significant rewards directly to the MetaDAOs that successfully build the Midgame products.  Endgame The Endgame Products represent the most advanced long term designs of products that converge on the theoretical limits of efficiency gains that are possible for a DeFi protocol like Maker, including highly advanced tokenomics. The Endgame Products could take a decade to develop fully, and some of them may be iterated on and further improved for many more decades as they seek to reach ever greater levels of efficiency and security. The Endgame Products are developed through the Creator Quest framework.  image3298\u00d71522 460 KB  The Pregame Products contain all the requirements that must be in place before the Endgame Plan Launch can happen. The focus of the Pregame products are to deliver the greatest possible impact in terms of growth and short term momentum that can become long term sustainable with the follow up developments in the later stages of the Endgame Plan Product Roadmap. Almost all Pregame Products are simple copies of existing DeFi primitives, very simple smart contract mechanisms, and in some cases out of the box solutions (such as balancer or uniswap LP tokens). The objective of the Pregame Products are to bootstrap the MetaDAO ecosystem, maximize Dai generated from Staked ETH which is critical to future proof the decentralized collateral backing of Dai, and to incentivize MKR holders to delegate their votes in order to increase voter participation in Maker governance, and make governance decisions more diversified.  Endgame Plan Launch within 12 months The technical pieces of the Pregame Products are simple enough that it may be possible to prepare all of them within 12 months, allowing for a quick Endgame Plan Launch to build highly impactful short term momentum. Alongside the technical implementations, a comprehensive clustering process for the first MetaDAOs must also occur, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to finish before the technical pieces are in place and the MetaDAO tokens can begin distribution.  Detailed list of all the Pregame Products The following section contains each of the Pregame Products alongside a detailed description.  image3226\u00d71774 303 KB  The Endgame Plan Launch MIP Set is a MIP Set of multiple interdependent MIPs that together implement the Endgame Launch. The MIPs in the MIP Set play fundamental governance roles similar to MIP0 and MIP1 by defining fundamental rules of governance that will be binding on all future MIPs. Alongside these core rules are also many specific decisions and specifications that help maximally define the Endgame Plan Launch and promote ossification and minimize confusion and uncertainty and the ability to switch directions or make fundamental changes to governance.  Purpose and Values The MIP Set will contain MIPs that establish a social contract in the community enshrining values such as Clean Money and funding for charity and public goods, that will later be directly implemented through RWA allocation frameworks and MetaDAO tokenomics. The MIPs will also spell the intangible value that the community expects to gain from following the purpose and values, in order to ensure the community will better be able to align in the long term on the fundamental logic of why the purpose and values exist, rather than just seeing them as some boxes to check.  Immutable tokenomics The MIP Set will contain a MIP that defines completely immutable tokenomics schedules for both MKR and MetaDAO tokens. These token emission and distribution schedules should be impossible to change after the fact, in order to provide complete certainty around long term token supply and distribution, and prevent power struggles related to to control of token emissions.  Constitution The MIP Set will contain a constitution that defines what aspects of governance processes are immutable and should change minimally, as well as fundamental expectation of different governance participants, including voters and the decentralized workforce. It will particular spell out neutrality requirements for different Decentralized Workforce participants, and explain the reasoning and the risks involved if neutrality isn\u2019t upheld, in order to maximize the likelihood that voters in the long run will choose to enforce the constitution through their understanding of how exactly it benefits them to do so.  Endgame Plan Product Roadmap specification MIPs A MIP for each of the Endgame Plan products provides as much clarity as possible around their implementation and requirements. Creator Quest payouts will directly rely on these product specification MIPs, in order to maximize their potential for ossification and minimize the chance that the product roadmap will randomly change or become sources of power struggles. The Endgame Plan Launch MIP Set is implemented entirely through MIPs, meaning it is purely governance proposal text and has no technical component to it, and requires no technical resources.  image3260\u00d71800 504 KB   ETHD I: EtherDai EtherDai is the central user facing product of the entire Endgame Plan, as all other mechanisms and incentives aim to drive users towards EtherDai Vaults. ETHD I is the Pregame implementation of EtherDai, and uses a \u201cshortcut\u201d approach in order to quickly bootstrap the product rather than implement the full, long run scope of the product. The goal is to have a staked ETH token under the control of Maker governance, that can ultimately be upgraded to become a fully fledged synthetic asset which will provide many additional benefits and greater utility to users and the Maker protocol. ETHD I is implemented through a simple ERC20 token wrapper around Lido\u2019s Staked ETH. The ERC20 token wrapper allows users to take STETH and wrap it into ETHD, or take ETHD and unwrap it into STETH. Maker Governance has backdoor access to the ETHD collateral, as well as the ability to set permissions for minting and burning of ETHD. This allows Maker Governance to eventually upgrade ETHD to it\u2019s full Synthetic Asset form in the Midgame. Before this upgrade occurs, ETHD will be a very valuable and useful product that can easily generate network effects, as it piggybacks on Lidos best in class security, liquidity and efficiency. EtherDai must also be onboarded as Maker Vaults, possibly with multiple different options for risk parameters, or just with the same risk parameters as Steth. In order to facilitate large amounts of Dai generated from EtherDai vaults, the liquidity of EtherDai will need to be boosted with captive liquidity. This is initially done using short term yield farming of ETHD/DAI on uniswap (Explained later). This short term captive liquidity will be replaced by long term liquidity provided through Elixir accumulation (Explained later). EtherDai and the EtherDai Vaults are the only pregame products that can be launched before everything else, and their development and release should be the very first priority of the entire Endgame Plan. Before the other systems are in place, demand for EtherDai vaults can be bootstrapped by providing them with a temporary stability fee of 0%. This will build up a userbase that can later be monetized when Stability Fees and MetaDAO farms are activated.  Elixir I Elixir is the universal long term liquidity solution for Dai, ETHD and MKR in the Endgame Plan. Eventually, it is used to automatically provide sustainable, captive liquidity on all key decentralized marketplaces, and across all important L2s and L1s without needing manual intervention or short term incentives. The Pregame iteration of Elixir, Elixir I, is a simple balancer pool that consists of 1/3rd Dai, 1/3rd ETHD and 1/3rd MKR. During the Early Game Elixir I is accumulated by MetaDAOs by selling their MetaDAO tokens using the Anti-Rush Mechanic (Explained later).  Limit Order Staircase At the Endgame Plan Launch, large amounts of MKR and MetaDAO tokens are put into fixed limit orders on external decentralized exchanges to sell in a limit order staircase that accumulates Dai. The accumulated Dai is then exchanged via dss-kiln to Elixir. The obtained Elixir is used for various purposes, but in all cases as it accumulates it helps bootstrap captive liquidity for ETHD and MKR. This creates an accessible buying opportunity for new community members at Endgame Plan Launch and during the Early Game, and prevents unsustainable price action as a result of the new Rainbow Tokenomics and yield for MKR.  MetaDAO Tokens MetaDAO Tokens are simple ERC20 tokens that are administratively owned by the Maker Governance Security Module. They Initially have 7 billion tokens generated and sent to a Maker Governance account, from where they are distributed to Yield Farms, Workforce Bonus pools, and other end destinations. Once the MetaDAO Permanent Emissions System is ready for deployment in the Midgame, the ability to Mint and Burn MetaDAO tokens is authorized to those systems. The initial 6 Launch MetaDAO tokens are manually created, and starting with the 7th MetaDAO the tokens are created automatically by the Incubator (Explained in Midgame Products).  Meta Elixir I Meta Elixir is the core liquidity pool for MetaDAO tokens against MKR. Like Elixir, the goal is to be able to use Meta Elixir as the main source of cross-market and cross-chain MetaDAO token liquidity. It also helps establish MKR as the main trading currency for MetaDAO tokens across all markets. Meta Elixir I is a simplified version that is implemented through a simple Uniswap pool token of MetaDAO tokens against MKR. During the Early Game Meta Elixir I is continuously acquired by the Meta Elixir Acquisition Accounts, at a rate of 6667 MKR per year for the Meta Elixir Acquisition Account of each Launch MetaDAO (More details later in this part)  Simple offchain voting One of the only technical requirements necessary for MetaDAO governance to function, is the existence of a simple, offchain and gasless polling system that will allow MetaDAO token holders to vote in non binding polls that Maker Governance can then interpret and execute. The simplest form of this system, which would be enough to meet the requirement for Endgame Plan Launch would be to directly use snapshot.org polls with no additional configuration or development needed. However, it is possible that an adaptation of the Maker rollup based voting system could be available in time, which would provide a more secure gasless voting solution that also supports delegation (an Early Game Feature)  image1920\u00d71075 140 KB  The Rainbow Tokenomics is a central driver of the Endgame Plan. It brings modern tokenomics with maximized intangible value creation to the Maker protocol, while powering the MetaDAO ecosystem and solving long term sustainability issues related to workforce compensation. The name Rainbow Tokenomics refers to the fact that the Tokenomics system enables a wide range of diverse and unique MetaDAOs to exists and be freely available for MKR holders and Maker Protocol users to farm in a gamified and enticing user experience. The Rainbow Tokenomics significantly overhauls the tokenomics of the MKR token by introducing a permanent, continuous token emissions schedule that initially generates a fixed, additional 50,000 MKR tokens per year, or almost 137 MKR per day. As income generated by the protocol continues to be used for burning, this creates a circular flow of tokens that are emitted and then burned. Since the amount of tokens that are emitted are fixed, and the amount of tokens that are burned is variable based on protocol income, the total supply should converge towards a supply equilibrium where equal amounts of tokens are emitted and burned each day.  Interim Rainbow Tokenomics during the MetaDAO Proof of Concept phase The permanent activation of the Rainbow Tokenomics requires that the MetaDAO Proof of Concept phase passes, meaning that the initial 3 PoC MetaDAOs must hit the validation targets specified in Part 4 before it is viable to activate the MKR Permanent Emissions System. This requirement ensures that during the PoC phase no irreversible changes are made to the Maker Protocol and it will still be relatively easy to abort the MetaDAO Endgame strategy and pursue the Rai+ Endgame strategy instead (This is explained further in Part 7). During the Proof of Concept phase, no MKR is emitted, and instead 3333.3 MKR for each of the 3 PoC MetaDAOs (10000 MKR total) are manually transferred from the MKR reserve to the Meta Elixir Acquisition Accounts (explained further below) of each of the 3 Proof Of Concept MetaDAOs, to bring them through the 6 months of the Proof of Concept phase without requiring actual token emissions.  Early Game Rainbow Tokenomics After the MetaDAO PoC has been successfully passed after 6 months, the regular Rainbow Tokenomics that will be in effect during the Early Game are activated and the MKR Permanent Emissions System begins to emit 50000 MKR per year into the Rainbow Account. This account can whitelist other smart contracts to pull tokens from it, so each of the automatic components of the Rainbow Tokenomics can be plugged in to it one by one by Maker Governance. Initially, only Maker Governance has access to the account, and will manually perform operations on it that stand in for, and effectively simulate, the long run Rainbow Tokenomics. Over time, the manual functions are then replaced with automatic actions from smart contracts triggered by keepers. The 50,000 MKR from the Rainbow Account are split across 4 different accounts:  Meta Elixir Acquisition Up to 40,000 MKR goes to the Meta Elixir Acquisition Accounts. During the Early Game, these accounts are simple dss-kiln implementation that uses MKR to acquire Meta Elixir, at a rate of 6667 MKR per year for each active MetaDAO. Meta Elixir Acquisition Accounts for inactive MetaDAOs that have not yet launched, simply burn their MKR again. This means that the effective MKR emissions begin at only 20001 MKR per year after the MetaDAO PoC phase has passed, and before the 4th MetaDAO is activated. As specified above, during the MetaDAO PoC phase the Meta Elixir Acquisition Accounts are activated early, and are manually funded directly with 3333.3 MKR each (for a total of 10000 MKR) to last for the 6 month PoC period. In the Midgame, the Meta Elixir Acquisition Accounts are replaced by a single Rainbow Elixir Acquisition Account, and the acquired Rainbow Elixir begins to be distributed to Rainbow Engine users. The Meta Elixir that was accumulated before the activation of the Rainbow Engine and the Rainbow Elixir Acquisition Account, are converted to Rainbow Elixir, but are kept in a special Endgame Rainbow Engine Yield Boost Account where they remain until the Rainbow Engine receive its final upgrade and Rainbow NFTs are activated. At that point, the Rainbow Elixir of the Endgame Rainbow Engine Yield Boost Account is used to provide a short term additional yield boost to Rainbow Engine users, to smoothen the effect on the Rainbow Engine yield since some of the token emissions are redirected towards the Rainbow NFTs internal yield.  Workforce bonus Up to 4000 MKR per year is funneled from the Rainbow Account and into the Workforce Bonus Account. The Workforce Bonus Account is used for long run MKR bonus payment to Delegates, Council and Core Unit members. The MKR available in the Workforce Bonus Account is the only MKR available for decentralized workforce payments, and the decentralized workforce has no ability to tap into additional MKR emissions or bonus programs beyond the Workforce Bonus Account. The Workforce bonus emission schedule reduces with 400 MKR every 4 years, until 20 years after the Endgame Plan Launch when it permanently settles at 2000 MKR per year. The workforce bonus emissions reductions are offset by equal increases of the MKR getting funneled to the Rainbow Elixir Acquisition Account, meaning that over time less MKR is funneled to workforce bonuses and more MKR is funneled to Rainbow Engine MKR holders and MetaDAOs. This reflects that in the long term there will be very beneficial economies of scale that results in the relative requirement of administrative work compared to the size of the decentralized ecosystem will go down and be replaced with a greater reliance on the decentralized ecosystem itself.  MetaDAO incubation 2000 MKR per year is funneled from the Rainbow Account and into the MetaDAO Incubator Account. All MKR in the MetaDAO Incubator Account is converted to Elixir immediately through dss-kiln. The MetaDAO Incubator Account is used by the Incubator to provide seed Elixir for new MetaDAOs. The seed Elixir helps new MetaDAOs compete against existing, established MetaDAOs in the Elixir Wars and provides the tokens an intrinsic value from the moment farming starts. It also means that newly incubated MetaDAOs have collateral available at genesis which allows them to perform Results Guarantees for Maker, and allows them to receive D3M capital that they can allocate to their MetaDAO Lending Engine.  Creator Quests 2000 MKR per year is funneled to the Creator Quest Account for a period of 10 years (total of 20000 MKR). The Creator Quest Account immediately converts all received MKR into Elixir. This Elixir is then rewarded to CreatorDAOs as they complete Creator Quests by building Midgame and Endgame Products specified in the Endgame Plan Launch MIP Set. After 10 years, the 2000 MKR per year stops being funneled to the Creator Quest Account, and instead an additional 2000 MKR per year is funneled to the Rainbow Elixir Acquisition Account. At this point going forward, the total amount of Elixir availabe for all remaining Creator Quests will have been reached. Development on additional iterations of Endgame Products, beyond what is covered by the Creator Quests will be incentivized only through regular budgets and workforce bonuses.  The Well liquidity system The Well liquidity system is an advanced backend system of 3 liquidity pools that are owned directly by the Maker protocol. They play a unique role in providing liquidity for the Rainbow Tokenomics to function efficiently, and can only receive tokens, never send them out or spend them. Since they all market make against MKR, they also play the role of creating more captive liquidity for MKR and helping the ecosystem absorb MKR dilution events. A total of 2000 MKR per year is initially sent to the 3 different permanent liquidity pools . 1700 MKR per year is sent to The Well and converted to permanent Well LP tokens, which helps provide liquidity for MKR, Elixir and Rainbow Elixir. 250 MKR per year is sent to The Meta Well and converted to permanent Meta Well LP tokens, which helps provide liquidity of the different Meta Elixir tokens against each other, and against MKR. 50 MKR per year is sent to The MANO Well and converted to permanent MANO Well LP tokens, which provides liquidity for MANO against MKR. Every 4 years, the amounts sent are reduced by 10% of the original amount, until they reach 50% of the original amount at year 20, for a total of 1000 MKR per year. As the amount of MKR funneled to the Well Liquidity System reduces, the amount of MKR funneled to the Rainbow Elixir Acquisition Account increases correspondingly, resulting in an additional 1000 MKR per year going to Rainbow Elixir yield at year 20.  Rainbow Tokenomics end state In the very long term the Rainbow Tokenomics Permanent Emissions System emits tokens as follows: 45000 MKR per year to the Rainbow Elixir Acquisition Account for Rainbow Engine yield 2000 MKR per year to the Workforce Bonus Account 2000 MKR per year to the MetaDAO Incubator Account 850 MKR per year to The Well 125 MKR per year to The Meta Well 25 MKR per year to The MANO Well  image1920\u00d7888 110 KB  In addition to the emissions schedule of the Rainbow Tokenomics, the MKR Reserve of 77800 MKR that currently sits in the Governance Security Module (also known as the Pause Proxy) is used to bootstrap various tokenomics accounts that play a crucial role in the Endgame Plan Launch and during the Early Game. Many of these accounts are were already mentioned in the earlier section, but are listed here with their MKR reserve bootstrapping amounts included. This list isn\u2019t fully detailed of all tokenomics accounts of the entire Endgame Plan, and is just meant to give an overview of the requirements of the Endgame Plan Launch. Part 8 of the Endgame Plan will have the exact details of all accounts used across Maker and MetaDAOs.  Meta Elixir Acquisition Accounts As mentioned, before the Rainbow Tokenomics is activated when the proof of concept MetaDAOs hit the validation results specified in Part 4, the Meta Elixir Acquisition Accounts for the 3 PoC MetaDAOs will be bootstrapped with 10000 MKR, which will be used to acquire 3333 MKR worth of Meta Elixir for each of the MetaDAOs over a period of 6 months (the proof of concept phase). Following the PoC phase, the Rainbow Tokenomics is activated and the Meta Elixir Acquisition Accounts of the 6 launch MetaDAOs will receive MKR emissions at a rate of 6667 MKR per year. The Meta Elixir Acquisition Accounts work by receiving MKR, and then using dss-kiln to turn the MKR into Meta Elixir. The Meta Elixir is then accumulated. In the Midgame, once the Rainbow Elixir system has been developed, the Meta Elixir Acquisition Accounts for the 6 launch MetaDAOs will be replaced with Rainbow Elixir Acquisition Account that begins to acquire Rainbow Elixir at a rate of 40000 MKR per year (with increases over time to 45000 MKR per year based on the Rainbow Tokenomics specification).  Workforce Bonus Account The Workforce Bonus Account is an MKR account that holds the MKR that is used to pay out workforce MKR bonuses. It initially receives 33000 MKR from the reserves, and then receives an additional 4000 MKR per year once the Rainbow Tokenomics has been activated.  Incubator Account The Incubator Account is used by the Incubator system of the Forge. It is an account that receives 2000 MKR per year in MKR emissions from the Rainbow Tokenomics, and then converts the MKR to Elixir via dss-kiln. The Elixir is accumulated, and when the Incubator incubates a new MetaDAO, some or all Elixir contents of the Incubator Account is transferred to the new MetaDAOs Ember Account. The amount is determined by Maker Governance, and defaults to using all of the accumulated Elixir for new MetaDAOs. The Incubator Account does not receive any bootstrapping MKR from the MKR reserves, but immediately begins to accumulate MKR that is converted to Elixir once the Rainbow Tokenomics is activated.  Creator Quest Account The Creator Quest Account is a temporary tokenomics account used during the Creator Quest period, which lasts at least 10 years. The Creator Quest Account receives 13500 MKR from the MKR reserves, and converts this initial batch of MKR to Elixir using a Limit Order Staircase (described above) with a price range that is determined immediately prior to the Endgame Plan Launch. Any Dai received by the Creator Quest Account from the Limit Order Staircase is then converted to Elixir using dss-kiln. Once the Rainbow Tokenomics has been activated, the Creator Quest Account receives 2000 MKR per year for 10 years. This MKR received from MKR emissions is immediately converted to Elixir via dss-kiln. The Elixir is used to pay out Creator Quest Rewards based on predetermined rewards specified in the specification MIPs for each Midgame and Endgame Product.  The Core Well The Core Well is a core tokenomics backend infrastructure that is built in the Midgame. The Core Well Account also plays an important role in bootstrapping Elixir Liquidity at the Endgame Plan Launch. The Core Well receives 13500 bootstrapping MKR from the MKR Reserve, and, similar to the Creator Quest Account, this MKR is used to create a limit order staircase that sells the MKR for Dai, and then converts the Dai to Elixir using dss-kiln. All additional MKR received by the Core Well Account once the Rainbow Tokenomics have activated just accumulates as MKR, which remains dormant until activation of the Well. When the Core Well is activated, all of the Elixir and MKR in the Core Well Account is converted to Core Well LP tokens, and all additional MKR received by the Core Well Account is instantly converted into Core Well LP tokens. Once assets have entered the Core Well Account they can never leave again, and the Core Well can only grow its liquidity over time. The Core Well Account also accumulates capital from the MetaDAO Permanent Emissions System of all active MetaDAOs.  The Meta Well The Meta Well is a tokenomics backend infrastructure that is built in the Midgame, like The Core Well. The Meta Well Account is used to store MKR in preparation for the activation of The Meta Well in the Midgame. Before its activation in the Midgame, The Meta Well Account just sits dormant and accumulates MKR. It starts with a bootstrapping MKR amount of 2300 MKR, and accumulates 250 MKR per year from the Rainbow Tokenomics MKR emissions. It also accumulates capital from the MetaDAO Permanent Emissions System of all active MetaDAOs.  The MANO Well The MANO Well is a simple tokenomics back end infrastructure that provides liquidity for the MANO token against MKR. It is created from a simple uniswap LP pool of MANO/MKR liquidity. It is bootstrapped with 500 MKR from MKR reserves, and receives 50 MKR per year from the Rainbow Tokenomics MKR emissions. It is activated in the Early Game, once the MANO token is launched, and at that point begins to use its accumulated MKR to accumulate MANO/MKR LP tokens using dss-kiln. The MANO/MKR LP tokens remain permanently in the MANO Well, and the amount can only grow over time. It also accumulates capital from the MetaDAO Permanent Emissions System of all active MetaDAOs.  ETHD bootstrap liquidity mining The ETHD bootstrap liquidity mining account gets 5000 MKR from the MKR reserves. This MKR is used to fund a liquidity mining program that lasts up to 2 years, at a declining rate over the 2 year period. If enough Elixir is accumulated in the interim and ETHD liquidity in general becomes stable enough, then Maker Governance can choose to stop the liquidity mining program and transfer all remaining MKR to the Core Well Account.  image3390\u00d71834 448 KB  The Rainbow Farms are the main way to distribute MetaDAO tokens, making them central to the Endgame Plan. Additionally, there\u2019s also a farm specifically for incentivizing ETHD liquidity on Uniswap following the Endgame Plan Launch. The key to the successful bootstrapping and evolution of a MetaDAO is the distribution of its token. By getting the token into the right hands of people who are aligned with the vision, brand and metaverse of the MetaDAO, the community will be able to generate intangible value and be a force multiplier on top of the fundamental business models and income streams that the MetaDAO inherently contains, and can develop in the future. An important risk to consider is that if the MetaDAO token is distributed the wrong way, it simply becomes \u201cfree money\u201d that is sold for cash by the users and promptly forgotten about. This risk can never be fully eliminated, but it can be mitigated through a value preservation strategy. This means that the MetaDAO token is only distributed to users that are already users of Maker is some way. This way, at minimum Maker will be able to recapture some of the value that is being distributed with the free MetaDAO tokens. This is why Dai, ETHD Vaults and delegated MKR was chosen as the farming targets. In addition to the 3 MetaDAO token farms, there is also a 4th auxilliary farm targeting ETHD liquidity, in order to help bootstrap the usability and liquidity of ETHD, and make it suitable for a large scale Maker Vault debt ceiling.  Dai Farm The Dai farm is the simplest type of MetaDAO token farm. It is a smart contract for each MetaDAO token that exists, and users can deposit their Dai into one of the farms and begin earning MetaDAO tokens on their Dai. Using Dai to farm MetaDAO tokens makes the Dai ineligible for earning the Dai Savings Rate. This means that MetaDAO tokens can help make a higher Dai Savings Rate sustainable since it guarantees not all Dai will be earning it. The amount of MetaDAO tokens that goes to the Dai farms changes depending on Maker Governance adjusting the MetaDAO Token Balancing Lever (explained later).  ETHD Vault Farm The ETHD Vault Farm is the MetaDAO Token farm that is most likely to distribute the most MetaDAO tokens. It plays a central role in the Endgame Plan since it is the main mechanism that incentivizes more users to generate more Dai from ETH collateral, which makes Dai more decentralized and resilient. The ETHD Vault Farm allows users to farm MetaDAO tokens based on the amount of debt they have in their ETHD Vaults. There is a farming smart contract for each MetaDAO token, and the users picks which MetaDAO token they want to farm and deposit their ETHD Vault into the farm. They then begin to earn the MetaDAO tokens. The amount of MetaDAO tokens that users earn from ETHD Vault farms depends how Maker Governance has adjusted the MetaDAO Token Balancing Lever (explained later).  Delegated MKR Farm The Delegated MKR Farm is a key mechanism in solving the issue of MKR voter apathy in the short run. It is a set of farming contracts, one for each MetaDAO, that allows users to pick which MetaDAO token they wish to farm, and then deposit their delegated MKR into the farm. It is only possible to farm MetaDAO tokens with MKR that is actively delegating and participating in governance. This may require a change to the delegation system in order to make the receipts users get when delegating transferable or otherwise compatible with a farming smart contract.  ETHD/DAI bootstrap liquidity farm The ETHD/DAI bootstrap liquidity farm is a simple uniswap farm that rewards MKR to users that deposit ETHD/DAI full range Univ3 LP tokens into it. It is made from an out of the box univ3 farming solution. Unlike the other Singularity Engine farms, the ETHD/DAI bootstrap liquidity farm pays out MKR as rewards, not MetaDAO tokens, and there is only one farming smart contract available.  image3302\u00d71746 457 KB  The Rainbow Farm frontend is a basic prerequisite for the Endgame Plan Launch, that makes it user friendly for people to farm the MetaDAO tokens. It is designed to be as simple as possible, and expose no functionality beyond depositing into Rainbow Farms themselves. The frontend can also contain instructions about how to obtain the farmable tokens in the first place, and later, more advanced iterations could begin integrating the entire user flow into the frontend - this eventually evolves into the Midgame Decentralized Frontend Product.  image1920\u00d7993 108 KB  The token supply for each MetaDAO follow a similar distribution scheme. The primary way that the initial MetaDAO tokens are distributed are through the 3 Rainbow Farms. A total of 3 billion MetaDAO tokens are distributed via yield farming for new MetaDAOs. The distribution of the 3 billion MetaDAO tokens follows a halving scheme comparable to Bitcoin mining, but with a fixed end to the distribution after 4 \u201chalvings\u201d, with the 4th and 5th interval distributing at the same rate. Initially the halving interval is 2 years, but this increases over time for new MetaDAOs, as more MetaDAOs have launched. This is the distribution scheme for the 6 initial MetaDAOs that all follow the 2 year halving interval: Interval 1 (Year 0-2): 1.5 billion tokens distributed in total Interval 2 (Year 2-4): 750 million tokens distributed in total Interval 3 (Year 4-6): 375 million tokens distributed in total Interval 4 (Year 6-8): 187.5 million tokens distributed in total Interval 5 (Year 8-10): 187.5 million tokens distributed in total (No halving, so the issuance ends) Of the total distributed each interval, the MetaDAO tokens are split across the 3 types of Rainbow Farms: Dai, ETHD Vaults, and Delegated MKR. The Delegated MKR farms always receive a fixed amount of MetaDAO tokens equal to 1/3rd of the total supply being distributed each interval. The ETHD and Dai farms receive 2/3rds of the total supply of MetaDAO tokens, but it is split dynamically between ETHD and Dai vaults. This is because the MetaDAO token distribution affects the demand and supply balance of Dai. This means that it can affect the peg, and as such must be a risk parameter adjustable by Maker Governance in order to help stabilize Dai, rather than destabilize it. This mechanism is called the Farm Balancing Lever, and is a variable parameter that determines how much of the MetaDAO tokens goes towards the Dai farms and how much of the MetaDAO tokens goes towards the ETHD Vaults. The value of the parameter is defined as the fraction that goes to the Dai farms. All MetaDAO tokens are affected equally by the Farm Balancing Lever.  Example As an example, if there is a single MetaDAO that was launched one year ago (meaning it is in its first 2-year interval), and the Farm Balancing Lever parameter is set to 0.2, then the MetaDAO farms would distribute token as follows: The Dai farms would get: (\u2154 * 1.5 billion) * 0.2 = 200 million MDAO per year, or 547000 MDAO per day And the ETHD Vault farms would get: (\u2154 * 1.5 billion) * (1-0.2) = 800 million MDAO per year, or 2.2 million MDAO per day Since most of the MDAO token incentives goes to incentivize Dai generation from ETHD vaults, there is a lot of Dai supply in circulation generated from vaults. If suddenly there\u2019s a demand shock and Dai demand drops as users sell their Dai for other tokens, then Maker Governance can react by changing the Farm Balancing Lever parameter. If the parameter is changed to 0.5, then the daily distributions would change: The Dai farms would get: (\u2154 * 1.5 billion) * 0.5 = 500 million MDAO per year or 1.37 million MDAO per day The ETHD Vault farms would receive the same amount as a Farm Balancing Lever paramter of 0.5 means an exact 50/50 split between Dai and ETHD Vault farms. The result would be that the number of MDAO tokens farmed by Dai users each day would increase by 823000, and the number of MDAO tokens farmed by ETHD Vault users each day would reduce by the same amount. This immediate change in number of tokens farmed by Dai users and ETHD Vault users, would make it more attractive to hold Dai, and less attractive to generate Dai from vaults. The resulting increase in demand and decrease in supply would help support the price of Dai and help prevent depegging. Should there be an even more extreme demand shock, then Maker Governance could choose to set the Farm Balancing Lever parameter to 1. This would result in the entire 1 billion MDAO tokens per year to go towards Dai farms only, and ETHD Vaults would receive no tokens at all. If this significant shift in demand and supply for Dai still wouldn\u2019t be enough, then Maker could use its more traditional monetary tools, such as increasing the Dai Savings Rate.  image2818\u00d71662 459 KB  In addition to the 3 yield farms, which act as the primary means of MetaDAO token distribution, some additional bootstrapping distribution funnels also exist.  Workforce bonus tokens First is the MetaDAO Workforce Bonus account, which is a MetaDAO governance controlled account that holds MetaDAO tokens that can be used to pay out workforce budgets in MetaDAO tokens, in order to reward DAO contributors in tokens that help align their incentives with the MetaDAO. The 6 launch MetaDAOs, and any additional MetaDAOs that are created before the long term MetaDAO Permanent Emissions System is activated, are created with 750 million MetaDAO Tokens in their Workforce Bonus Accounts. MetaDAOs created after the MetaDAO Permanent Emissions System is finished are created with 500 million MetaDAO tokens, since they will immediately receive additional tokens from the MetaDAO Permanent Emissions System. The Workforce Bonus is critical for MetaDAOs, since it is very important to attract key talent that is long term aligned to help bootstrap and incubate the MetaDAO in its earliest phase. For this reason it is important to have significant amount of tokens available to pay out with long term vesting to the right people.  Treasury funding tokens In order to raise cash to pay bootstrapping costs and early contributors, new MetaDAOs are created with 250 million MetaDAO tokens in a Treasury Bootstrapping Account, which uses dss-kiln to sell the MetaDAO tokens over a 2 year period for Dai. This helps create a baseline amount of Dai that can be used to pay early contributors and build up a collateral pool, to allow the MetaDAO to get off the ground.  image2862\u00d71680 196 KB  The Anti Rush Mechanic prevents MetaDAO tokens from being too volatile when they are launched by having 3 billion MetaDAO tokens available as sell liquidity for each new MetaDAO. This is useful both around the Endgame Plan Launch for the 6 Launch MetaDAOs, but also for long term MetaDAO launches in general. The Anti Rush Mechanic works with a simple approach of setting up a massive sell limit order staircase that ensures that lots of new MetaDAO tokens are sold on the market if the price starts to rise fast. This ensures that MetaDAO tokens are less volatile early on, and that any price volatility is captured by the MetaDAO itself and converted to permanent treasury value, that will help the MetaDAO build sustainable momentum rather than just fleeting price increases. The mechanism works by using an external DEX to place 100 limit orders. Each limit orders is for 30 million MDAO, and start at a price of 0.01 DAI per MDAO, with each additional limit order placed at 0.001 higher increments, until the final limit order at 0.109 DAI per MDAO. Before the MetaDAO Ember Burn Engine is ready, the Dai from Anti Rush Mechanic limit orders accrue to the Anti Rush Mechanic Account, and the Anti Rush Mechanic Account then uses dss-kiln to convert all received Dai to Elixir that is accumulated in the account. Once the MetaDAO Ember Burn Engine is ready, all accumulated Elixir from the Anti Rush Mechanic Account is transferred to Ember, and all Dai acquired from future Anti Rush Mechanic limit orders is sent directly to the MetaDAO surplus buffer.  image3090\u00d71502 207 KB  This slide gives a unified overview of the various accounts that the 6 Launch MetaDAOs will be created with during the Pregame and Early Game. Most of these accounts are temporary and will eventually cease to be used once they run out of their initial allocation of MetaDAO tokens, with the exception of the Workforce Bonus Account which will be used by the MetaDAO Permanent Emissions System. More accounts and details of the long term tokenomics are described in the Midgame Products.  image3202\u00d71394 322 KB  The Early Game is the phase immediately following the Endgame Plan Launch, after all the Pregame Products have been finished, the Endgame Plan Launch MIP has been approved, and the Launch MetaDAOs have been successfully launched. The main focus of the Early Game products is to act as \u201cfast-follow\u201d products that can build on top of the momentum created from the Endgame Plan Launch and act as a force multiplier, reaching a critical mass that can keep the momentum going until the Midgame products are released several years later. The Early Game Products are the only phase of products where some of the products can be completely skipped, which will be determined by the MetaDAOs and Maker Governance in practice once the Early Game is reached. It may turn out that in some cases Early Game products will be skipped due to prioritization, if the value they deliver isn\u2019t enough to make up for delaying work on Midgame Products.  image3340\u00d71828 508 KB  The MetaDAO Vault Adoption Mechanism is a product that can be launched immediately following the Endgame Plan Launch. It uses a MIP by Maker Governance to provide a MetaDAO with a Vault Adoption Debt Ceiling and Cost of Capital, as well as other requirements such as junior capital. Once a Vault Adoption MIP is in place, the MetaDAO is then able to use its governance process to onboard collateral directly to the Maker Primary Vault Engine. Adopted Vaults technically function like regular vaults, but Maker periodically transfers all stability fees earned from them in excess of the Vault Adoption Cost of Capital. So if the stability fee of a vault type is 3%, and the Vault Adoption Cost of Capital is 2%, then Maker will transfer 1% of the average debt of the Adopted Vaults to the MetaDAO. All liquidation penalties are also transferred to the MetaDAO. In return for these benefits, the MetaDAO assumes all risks and running costs of the vault. If undercollateralization and liquidation losses occur, then Maker will use the MetaDAOs treasury and reserve assets as junior capital to fully reimburse any losses. If there\u2019s not enough treasury and reserve assets, Maker will issue additional MetaDAO tokens until the losses are fully recovered. Additionally, the MetaDAO has to develop all smart contracts and oracles, and pay for ongoing oracle costs. MetaDAOs can use Adopted Vaults to experiment with different oracles, including using the Medianizer directly without the Oracle Security Module, or using other oracle providers such as chainlink. They can also develop advanced Vault mechanics, including institutional Vaults or fixed rate Vaults. The MetaDAO Vault Adoption Mechanism will also be used for all RWA Vaults until the MetaDAO Lending Engine is developed in the Midgame. Existing Maker Vaults, including RWA Vaults, can be migrated to Adopted Vaults following the Endgame Plan Launch. It requires Maker to designate the vaults as \u201cadoptable vaults\u201d using a MIP. MetaDAOs can then use their governance process to apply for adoption of a Vault. if they already have an active MetaDAO Vault Adoption MIP and have available Debt Ceiling. Then application must then finally be confirmed by Maker Governance, which must decide who gets to adopt the Vault if two MetaDAOs apply to adopt the same Vault.  image1920\u00d71111 119 KB  A key opportunity of the Endgame Plan is to quickly begin tapping into the enormous untapped potential of the Maker Oracle Network, the worlds oldest functioning oracle system that pioneered many core innovations of decentralized oracles. After much research it is becoming clear that the basic business model of running oracles for profit isn\u2019t realistic for Maker when competing with projects that have massive economies of scale such as Chainlink, and instead the value can be realized by expanding the oracle node network into becoming about more than just oracles, since Maker has invested into the significant cost of having a large, reliable and trusted network of high security nodes. The basic oracle function can then be offered for free as a reliable public good consumed by the Maker Protocol and potentially other ecosystem participants.  Rollup New opportunities for the Maker Node Network includes running decentralized sequencers for a future Maker Rollup (an Endgame Product), making it a lot cheaper to operate such a system.  Staking The most economically powerful opportunity for the Maker Node Network is operating nodes in a native Maker Staking Network based on the Lido model (another Endgame Product). This backend product can provide a way for Maker to monetize the ETHD product without having to cut into user fees, by instead allocating a small slice of the ETHD collateral to the native Maker Staking Token and earn protocol fees from it that are competitive with other staking network protocol fees.  Nodes as a service The Maker Node Network can also perform \u201cfor hire\u201d services by providing nodes to other protocols, including staking protocols such as Lido that may be getting a lot of adoption from being ETHD collateral, or running Chainlink nodes or nodes for other successful node-based protocols such as other rollup sequencers or other L1 blockchains.  $MANO fundamental value and Delegated Staking The significant potential value contained in the vision for the Maker Node Network can be tapped into and amplified with an ecosystem token: $MANO, the Maker Node Network token. This token has a simple design where MANO holders can stake their tokens towards existing Node Operators, locking the tokens behind an unlock duration. If any issue occurs with the Node Operator, the delegated MANO staking capital takes first loss on 80% of the penalty or loss, with the MetaDAO that has adopted the Node Operator only taking first loss on 20% of the penalty or loss. In return MANO Delegated Stakers earn 50% of the guarantee premium of the Node Operator. If the staked MANO isn\u2019t enough to cover 80% of the total penalty or loss, the MetaDAO that has adopted the Node Operator is fully responsible for paying all remaining costs. The staking functionality will not be developed until later in the Endgame Plan, and the token will initially just be a simple ERC20 token where the income streams from oracle guarantee premium payments from Maker will be funneled to the MANO Well to provide liquidity for the MANO token. This means that even without the staking feature, MANO tokens will have real fundamental value from the the moment they are launched.  image1920\u00d71027 101 KB  The MANO tokens are distributed quickly in order to begin bootstrapping the Maker Node Network ecosystem as soon as possible, and to provide intangible value for MetaDAO token holders by making the tokens interactive from very early on. The distribution happens through Singularity Engine Farms similar to the Dai farm, with MetaDAO tokens for each MetaDAO as the farming tokens.  Early game distribution The MANO token distribution to the MANO farms follows a permanent emissions schedule similar to MKR in Rainbow Tokenomics. Initially with a fixed amount of up to 50 million MANO tokens emitted per year. During the Endgame Plan Launch, the Launch MetaDAOs each receive a fixed allocation of 8.33 million MANO per year distributed to their MANO farms, so the amount of MANO emitted ramps up until it reaches the full 50 million when all 6 Launch MetaDAOs have launched. Once at least 6 MetaDAOs have launched, but before Midgame has been reached and the long term distribution has been activated, the 50 million yearly MANO tokens are split equally amongst all the active MetaDAOs.  Long term distribution In the Midgame, when Rainbow Tokenomics have been fully activated, the permanent MANO emissions schedule is updated to also emit an addititional 1% of the total MANO supply per year. This ensures that there will always be a significant amount of MANO tokens available for MetaDAOs to farm in the very long run equilibrium. Additionally, the split of the MANO Emissions that goes to each MetaDAO farm begins to follow the same split as Rainbow Tokenomics, and is based on the relative amount of Elixir each MetaDAO has.  MANO Rollup Ecosystem Account As described above, the MANO token will among its many other uses also act as the native Delegated Staking token for the Maker Ecosystem Rollup, and as a result will benefit from the rollup capturing a rich ecosystem with significant network effects. To help this along, the MANO Rollup Ecosystem Fund is an account controlled by Maker Governance that is created with 100 million MANO, that is meant to be distributed for yield farming rewards to external protocols that launch on the Maker Rollup, similar to the ecosystem funds of other Rollups or L1s Since MANO doesn\u2019t have its own governance, all decisions related to the MANO Rollup Ecosystem Account are made by MKR holders.  MANO Development Fund In order to ensure that the development of the Maker Node Network helps contribute to the value of the MANO token 100 million MANO is put into a special Workforce Bonus account. This account is meant to partially replace other workforce bonuses that developers that are working specifically on the Maker Node Network would receive, and is also used to provide grants for independent work that benefits the Maker Node Network or MANO in some way. Since MANO doesn\u2019t have its own governance, all decisions related to the MANO Workforce Bonus account are made by MKR holders.  image3258\u00d71844 272 KB  Rainbow Vaults are a powerful but simple Early Game Product that provides short term utility to MKR before the Rainbow Engine is ready in the Midgame. It works by creating a regular Maker Vault Type that can take actively delegating MKR deposited in a Rainbow Farm as collateral. This allows MKR holders to continue participating in governance, while also farming MetaDAO tokens and at the same time also generate Dai. The Liquidation Ratio for Rainbow Vaults must be very high, and, depending on its complexity, the feature of having an even higher starting collateral ratio could be implemented (as it could justify a lower LR, making for less liquidations and better UX). Rainbow Vaults, like the Rainbow Tokenomics Engine (described in the Midgame Products), creates Dai backed by MKR which would result in greater losses to Dai holders in an Emergency Shutdown event. This downside is mitigated by the fact that it provides a significant incentive for MKR holders to participate in governance and delegate their MKR. Increased governance participation helps mitigate risks that can lead to an Emergency Shutdown in the first place, such as a governance attack.  image1920\u00d71067 65.2 KB   MetaDAO Vote Delegation MetaDAO Vote Delegation is a feature that is necessary for MetaDAOs to scale up their governance and communities over time, as it would allow them to operate higher bandwidth governance without token holders being extremely active. Unlike Maker, MetaDAOs aren\u2019t at high risk if there are only very few MetaDAO delegates, so vote delegation is purely a benefit for MetaDAOs.  Unified DAO Toolkit The Unified DAO Toolkit is a critical tool that will help organize the Decentralized Workforce and enable the community to have a possibility of actually following the work of the decentralized workforce, without requiring additional bureaucracy and paperwork. It works by streamlining and organizing all processes into a single system with modules for each of the Scope Maps of Maker Governance (Described in Part 7). The Unified DAO Toolkit uses a consistent language, design and user experience to make it as easy as possible to understand the information being presented, and it acts as a single source of all information necessary to deeply understand and participate in governance or the decentralized workforce. A key feature of the Unified DAO Toolkit is that it unifies the tooling used both for governance and for work processes, rather than splitting them up into an operational component and an \u201cinvestor relations\u201d component. This means that the format used to report the KPIs and results of a Core Unit, such as a transparency or budget report, is the same format as actual work and collaboration, like a kanban board or internal process documentation.  image3172\u00d71850 288 KB   Sharded Vault Engines Sharded Vault Engines are a technology Maker has been working on for a very long time, and the first iteration involves deploying new versions of the original MCD codebase, with modifications, on Optimism, Arbitrum and Starknet. This work can be finished during the Early Game to help further boost Makers momentum alongside the other developments of the Endgame Plan. The Sharded Vault Engines will enable the Homebase System, that benefits CreatorDAOs by giving them a small revenue share of all income earned by the Sharded Vault Engine on the Homebase they choose. Sharded Vault Engines also enables the development of Multichain Rainbow Farms, and will enable MetaDAO Vault Adoption to become multichain as well. Since L2 adoption has not yet reached critical mass, the launch of the Sharded Vault Engines is a major opportunity to build momentum for L2 adoption and combining it with as many other multichain initiatives will be the best way to achieve this.  Maker Teleport Maker Teleport is an L2 bridge system that enables fast withdrawals from Optimistic Rollups. It is useful in creating a better L2 user experience and giving Dai a unique advantage when it comes to multichain UX. It is a part of the Sharded Vault Engine roadmap and leverages the same infrastructure and features, with some additional technology required by the Maker Node Network.  image3178\u00d71680 285 KB   Multichain Rainbow Farms Multichain deployments of the Rainbow Farms would allow Dai users and ETHD Vault users to also farm MetaDAO tokens on an L2 where a Sharded Vault Engine is present. The main technical challenge to make this possible is an additional mechanism similar to the Farm Balancing Lever, called the Multichain Farm Balancing Lever that splits up the MetaDAO tokens between mainnet and the L2s. The Multichain Farm Balancing Lever works automatically based on oracle input to regulate the amount of MetaDAO tokens that go to each multichain farm, in order to make the returns earned when farming the same MetaDAO tokens roughly the same across all shards. As a part of the multichain expansion of the Maker Protocol with Sharded Vault Engines to L2s, it will be crucial to combine as many efforts together as possible in order to concentrate the possibility of network effects emerging on the L2s, something that is currently not the case. Multichain Rainbow Farms will be a crucial piece of this combined approach as it provides a very strong incentive for users to migrate to L2.  Multichain Dai Savings Rate Similar to the Multichain Rainbow Farms, Multichain Dai Savings Rate would also allow users to access the Dai Savings Rate on L2s, making for a better user experience. This feature is relatively straightforward, and would require no balancing mechanisms or similar. It would simply either tap into the ability for Sharded Vault Engines to generate Dai on an L2 they are present on, or be pre-funded with Dai bridged to the L2 directly from the Maker Protocol core surplus buffer.

                    "content": "Thanks for the questions, will be very helpful to go through this and try to explain things from some different perspectives     flipflopflapdelegate:  What will be the network effects of early ETHD I (pregame) end users? In other words - what would you say is the advantage to have ETHD versus just using wSTETH to open a Vault? How long do you believe it it will take to get to the ETHD/DAI bootstrapping liquidity farm? Is your thinking here that ETHD will be gain traction in MetaDAO interval 1 ( Year 0-2)?   The main reason to do this is because we can begin to build up userbase for ETHD Vaults, so that we have as much Dai as possible generated from ETHD, which will then be even more valuable to us once we upgrade ETHD to a synthetic asset. The network effect is that we can begin to build liquidity for the token directly. Meaning we can get exchanges to list ETHD and we can get AMM positions for ETHD, and DAO treasuries can hold it etc. Mainly we should expect this kind of usecase to emerge because of the demand for using it to generate Dai and farm MDAO with. ETHD would gain significant traction right from day 0 of the Endgame Plan Launch because it would receive massive MetaDAO token benefits for those who generate Dai with it. The ETHD/DAI bootstrapping pool is necessary to be able to handle large scale liquidiations of ETHD Vault positions. This is only necessary in the very short run until we have built up enough protocol owned Elixir that we don\u2019t need to rent liquidity any longer.     flipflopflapdelegate:  This is high emissions \u2014 being there done that \u2014 most sell as soon as they get rewards \u2014 how do you believe this can be overcome? Perhaps I missed your proposed solution. Will the selling pressure be negated by the Anti Rush Mechanics?   You can never eliminate this risk, and shouldn\u2019t try to because it\u2019s better to just deal with it so you have a higher likelihood of attracting the holders as well, by making the UX as good as possible. Instead you can mitigate the risk through a value preservation strategy  An important risk to consider is that if the MetaDAO token is distributed the wrong way, it simply becomes \u201cfree money\u201d that is sold for cash by the users and promptly forgotten about. This risk can never be fully eliminated, but it can be mitigated through a value preservation strategy. This means that the MetaDAO token is only distributed to users that are already users of Maker is some way. This way, at minimum Maker will be able to recapture some of the value that is being distributed with the free MetaDAO tokens. This is why Dai, ETHD Vaults and delegated MKR was chosen as the farming targets.  Essentially, we will be able to charge a stability fee on the ETHD Vaults to recover some of the value of the tokens we are handing out.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Okay I see \u2014 you\u2019re going to un-entice token owners from selling by issuing a start price of 0.01 but to be honest I would lower that to 0.005   You misunderstood what the Anti Rush Mechanic does, it is a sell wall. So it doesn\u2019t prevent people from selling or encourage them to hold, it prevents the token from pumping unsustainably or used for a pump and dump. We don\u2019t necessarily care if people excessively sell the MetaDAO tokens. Because they have real and significant fundamental value, if they are underpriced that just creates an opportunity. The Maker protocol will then be buying them for cheap with the Rainbow Tokenomics, and so will the long term community members that can understand the real value proposition.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Ok if I understand this correctly this allows a MetaDAO to fund itself when necessary.   MetaDAO Vault adoption is a way for a MetaDAO to simulate a d3m by using Makers own vault engine to operate vaults. I\u2019m not sure how to phrase it more clearly in the post, but let me try to quote a relevant part:  Adopted Vaults technically function like regular vaults, but Maker periodically transfers all stability fees earned from them in excess of the Vault Adoption Cost of Capital. So if the stability fee of a vault type is 3%, and the Vault Adoption Cost of Capital is 2%, then Maker will transfer 1% of the average debt of the Adopted Vaults to the MetaDAO. All liquidation penalties are also transferred to the MetaDAO.   In return for these benefits, the MetaDAO assumes all risks and running costs of the vault. If undercollateralization and liquidation losses occur, then Maker will use the MetaDAOs treasury and reserve assets as junior capital to fully reimburse any losses. If there\u2019s not enough treasury and reserve assets, Maker will issue additional MetaDAO tokens until the losses are fully recovered. Additionally, the MetaDAO has to develop all smart contracts and oracles, and pay for ongoing oracle costs.  Basically it\u2019s vault thats owned, governed and backstopped by the MetaDAO, but that is implemented on the Maker Protocol.  Is the idea here to also look for high-frequency trading platforms to also join the network by providing nodes to different markets that Maker is currently not offering? This is cool.  The idea is to use the same set of highly trusted and insured nodes that we use to run our oracles, to also tap into business opportunities in other node networks such as lido and chainlink. They are protocols that basically broker deals between end users and nodes, so our nodes can participate and potentially earn profits because of their economies of scale since they have such significant security and governance already in place. Thanks, hope people will ask more questions! ",

                    "content": "Still trying to wrap my head around the full extent of the Endgame proposal, so bear with me here\u2026  Some questions related to MetaDAO governance and delegation:   Since core MakerDAO will be farming MetaDAO tokens it will also accrue voting power for these MetaDAOs. How do you envision MakerDAO to \u2018wield\u2019 this influence\u2014would it be through proactive governance participation or only \u2018reactive\u2019 in case of high-impact governance decisions at the MetaDAO? Or would MakerDAO simply abstain from participation in MetaDAO governance?   I would expect core MakerDAO delegates\u2019 influence and respect to also seep into the periphery of the project (ie. MetaDAOs), which would make them perfect MetaDAO delegates. Such delegates would have MKR delegated to them, but also MetaDAO tokens (eg. MZR) and therefore would have multiple \u2018voting weights\u2019. Is this something that fits your Endgame vision, or do you regard this as conflict-of-interest that should be discouraged through policy. Probably won\u2019t be possible to fully mitigate this from happening due to the nature of on-chain vote delegation (eg. MakerDAO delegates also participating as MetaDAO shadow delegates).       rune:  One of the only technical requirements necessary for MetaDAO governance to function, is the existence of a simple, offchain and gasless polling system that will allow MetaDAO token holders to vote in non binding polls that Maker Governance can then interpret and execute.   I think the gasless poll voting system we\u2019re working on right now could be a good fit for MetaDAO governance, which will require fast and cheap/free token voting. We\u2019re building the system on top of the current voting infra, and it could easily be forked and fitted with a simple frontend (one for each MetaDAO) or we could adapt the Governance Portal to support multiple MetaDAOs in addition to core MakerDAO governance. This would also allow for multi-DAO delegates as previously mentioned in question #2, in addition to some other benefits such as linking MetaDAO proposals to MakerDAO execs, using common governance/voting primitives (eg. poll types, delegate features). We\u2019ll launch this gasless poll voting system for MakerDAO governance in Q3 and it will use Arbitrum, but the architecture is rollup-agnostic (barring some technical requirements). As you can tell I\u2019m still piecing together my understanding of the Endgame vision for MakerDAO<>MetaDAO governance\u2014as it starts to become more clear I\u2019ll try to share some ideas (and maybe some visual prototypes) for governance infrastructure/tooling bespoke to the Endgame vision.

It will particular spell out neutrality requirements for different Decentralized Workforce participants, and explain the reasoning and the risks involved if neutrality isn\u2019t upheld, in order to maximize the likelihood that voters in the long run will choose to enforce the constitution through their understanding of how exactly it benefits them to do so.   It strikes me that this is very much in line with Hasu\u2019s proposal at Simple MakerDAO \u2014 Governance from first principles, ie:    Create a rock-solid foundation of underlying principles of Maker. The constitution defines those parts that are explicitly NOT subject to frequent change and from which other decisions (e.g. on strategy or tactics) derive.  Encode in writing what we can\u2019t encode in smart contract code. Create a yardstick against which all other parts of the decision supply chain (delegates, council, MAs, CU members) can be held accountable \u2014 both by each other and by MKR holders.    For reasons I still do not understand, the very proposal of a constitution took a lot of flack in the latter thread. But it seems to me that many different members of the DAO want essentially the same thing: to ossify the core mechanics of governance and protect the sanctity of those processes. Funnily enough, both \u2018sides\u2019 of recent governance debates agree that Maker\u2019s existing governance system is under threat to some extent. Coming together to build a constitution could help unite the DAO around things that everyone agrees on: transparent decision-making, accountable leadership, etc. Even aside from the Endgame Plan, that exercise could do a lot of good for the community.
