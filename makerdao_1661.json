                    "content": " Introduction After working on it for almost a year, it is time to finally put the Endgame Plan to a vote. To kick it off, I\u2019m planning to submit a number of MIPs before next Wednesday to the September RFC/October voting cycle.  What MIPs to expect This post gives an overview of the Endgame Approval MIP Set that will be proposed on the forum before next Wednesday. Together, if all of them are approved (Except the optional LDO OTC swap MIP), they will trigger the Endgame Plan Pregame phase according to the Endgame Plan v3 Overview forum post. The MIPs will be posted as soon as possible, and most of them will not be submitted to RFC in their final shape, but just to ensure their inclusion in the October Governance cycle. There\u2019s a lot of technical requirements to make them completely ready and eligible for voting in October, so help will be appreciated from Delegates and others who wish to participate. It\u2019s important to note that just like the Endgame Plan itself has been heavily modified and overhauled multiple times over the past year based on open community feedback through various channels, these MIPs will be improved during the RFC period based on what we find to be the best solutions to the practical challenges we\u2019re dealing with.  1. Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters This MIP aims to normalize the preliminary efforts that are currently underway by some of the members of the Decentralized Workforce to \u201ccluster\u201d and prepare small coherent teams that could onboard to act as the internal decentralized workforce for the 7 Launch MetaDAOs of the Endgame Plan. There are currently 7 high quality clusters being developed, and as a result the Endgame Plan will prepare for the creation of 7 MetaDAOs at Endgame Plan Launch.  This MIP will establish the 7 Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters These are preliminary teams headed by an Incubating MetaDAO Facilitator that are authorized to use their resources in the Core Units to make preparations for onboarding proposals to the Launch MetaDAOs The Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters consists of 3 Creators, 2 Protectors and 2 Governors. A Recognized Creator Cluster will be attached to the DECO Core Unit. This means the resources of the DECO Core Unit will transfer to the MetaDAO that onboards the Cluster at Endgame Plan Launch. A Recognized Protector Cluster will be attached to the Strategic Finance Core Unit. This means the Strategic Finance Core Unit can use its governance powers to onboard RWA collateral that will be adopted by the Protector Cluster. Additionally, Strategic Finance will also use its governance powers to onboard RWA collateral on behalf of the other Recognized MetaDAO Launch Cluster The remaining 5 Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters will not attach to Core Units and instead informally operate within the existing Core Unit structures until their onboarding proposal to a MetaDAO at Endgame Plan Launch. 7 Forums and 7 Discord channels will be launched to enable the MetaDAO communities to begin their own clustering process, self-selecting the Internal Clusters to match with the most suitable communities.   2. MIP0 Endgame amendment The amendment process will be used to make MIP0 \u201cEndgame-ready\u201d. The main change is to make the RFC period of MIPs longer (3 months at first), but with Endgame Plan Launch MIPs specifically exempted. The secondary change is to deprecate almost all active MIPs, significantly cleaning up the MIPs and changing the way Maker Governance works to primarily work through Facilitator Governance Powers. For instance, this will completely deprecate and disable the MIP6 collateral onboarding process, and the signal request process, and many other MIPs that currently steer processes but often in ways that are different from how they were designed, and in many cases completely forgotten.  MIP0 will be amended using the MIP4 process The RFC period for all MIPs will be changed to 3 months The Endgame Plan Launch MIP Set is exempted, and has an RFC period of only 1 month All MIPs will be categorized as either Legacy or Endgame MIPs Legacy MIPs will generally be deprecated and not in effect, but during the first 4 years Governance Core Unit/Tribunal members can temporarily reactivate them and follow their process in individual cases if it\u2019s deemed necessary to fill a gap emerging during the transition to the Endgame MIPs. After 4 years Legacy MIPs will become completely deprecated and no longer useable for anything other than historical precedent. Endgame MIPs will continue to be active as now. Of the existing MIPs, these will convert to Endgame MIPs: MIP0, MIP4, MIP38, MIP39, MIP40, MIP41 (+ others, still needs to be filled out)   3. Optional LDO to MKR Swap MIP This MIP is completely optional, if it is rejected it doesn\u2019t impact the approval of the Endgame Plan. The proposal is to swap 20 million LDO from my holding company (originally obtained as early stage investor in Lido) for MKR in the Maker Pause Proxy at a large discount (around 33%) in Maker\u2019s favor. At current prices this would be a swap of approximately 40 million USD of LDO for 26.7 million USD of MKR. LDO has 3-5x the liquidity of MKR and is currently one of hottest tokens among smart money, and it is extremely hard to get ahold of large allocations. I\u2019m making this highly beneficial, optional deal available to Maker Governance because I believe in the public good potential of Maker and the Endgame Plan and want to show my own willingness to contribute to make it work. I also believe that Maker owning a large LDO stake is a crucial boost to the success potential of the Endgame Plan and helps make a lot of the economic dynamics come full circle early on. The Endgame Plan focuses on maximizing usage and accumulation of EtherDai, which during the first several years is a wrapped version of Lido Staked ETH. If Maker also holds LDO, then Maker gets to benefit massively from the significant Lido Staked ETH adoption that the Endgame Plan will cause. The 40 million USD of LDO can be used as liquid, decentralized starting collateral for the Protocol Owned Vault (unlike MKR, which cannot be used as collateral by Maker itself), establishing a much stronger starting position for the protocol to accumulate large amounts of decentralized collateral. This is further explained below, in the section about the Protocol Owned Vault. Additionally, if my holding company obtains a large additional stake of MKR in connection with the Endgame Plan that shows my commitment and belief in the value of MKR, which should signal confidence to other stakeholders on the sidelines. As always I will continue to work on the project for free with no other motivation needed than my existing MKR stake, and will ensure the DAO safely transitions to a stable equilibrium after the Endgame Plan Launch where my own involvement will no longer be necessary, before I leave. Obtaining additional MKR also increases my voting power further (back to about the ATH amount of MKR I\u2019ve had in the past) which will help lock in the irreversibility of the Endgame Plan by ensuring a hidden coalition of MKR voters cannot overturn the Endgame Plan if it has already been triggered by the approval of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set. This will force opponents to show up to vote in the first round, and will help establish greater certainty and remove potential for disruption for the workforce during the difficult transition period As stated above, this MIP is optional, but even if it is rejected I believe the fact that I made the proposal at all is critical for establishing a strong and positive meta of the Endgame Plan, as there can then be no bad feelings about how I will potentially personally benefit from the significant adoption of Lido Staked ETH the Endgame Plan will cause, due to the significant LDO holdings of my holding company.  This MIP establishes an OTC deal between Maker and Rune\u2019s holding company. If the MIP is approved, Maker Governance commits to send MKR from the Pause Proxy after receiving LDO from Rune\u2019s holding company to a predetermined Ethereum Address. The transfers will be in two rounds, with the first swap of about 75% of the amount done immediately following the successful vote, and the second swap of the remaining 25% happening around December 17 (due to remaining vesting periods). The exact rate of the swap will be locked at the moment the vote ends successfully. It will be determined based on a formula that gives a higher discount to Maker if MKR is lower is relative to LDO, and a lower discount if MKR is higher relative to LDO. At current rates (LDO @ 2 USD and MKR @ 800 USD) the discount will be approximately 33% in Maker\u2019s favor.   4. Collateral Onboarding Special Mandates One of the biggest impacts of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set is that it will completely change collateral onboarding in Maker, most notably by shutting down the MIP6 process (by turning it into a Legacy MIP), which will as a consequence effectively reject all active MIP6 applications, or any other kind of external collateral onboarding application. Instead all collateral onboarding can only be done \u201cinside-out\u201d based on the conscious priority and decision by a Core Unit Facilitator, and they will have no obligation to honor the massive governance debt the old collateral onboarding processes have accumulated over time, unless they consider it to be in the best interest of Maker. Dealing with the unsustainable nature of the old collateral onboarding process is a key step to cleaning up Maker Governance and moving past bad decisions and organizational debt that has accumulated due to the over complex nature of Maker Governance. By formally cleaning up and ending the ever-growing pile of collateral onboarding backlog, Maker Governance will be able to give more clear signals and set realistic expectations to external partners about their chances of getting onboarded to the Maker Protocol.  4.1 Temporary RWA Collateral Onboarding Mandate amendment for Strategic Finance Core Unit As the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set offboards the RWF core unit in order to reboot Makers Real World Asset efforts, restructured based on the Protectors and the Protector Clusters, it is critical that action is taken to ensure continuity of important RWA efforts in the meantime, especially as the Endgame Plan emphasizes the importance of growing revenues that can be used to fund the Protocol Owned Vault as quickly as possible. The proposal is to use the Strategic Finance Core Unit which is also has a Protector Cluster attached to it, as the temporary solution that allows RWA work to continue, and improves it by removing red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy that currently exists. In practice the degree that this power is used should be limited to cashlike RWA that can deliver immediate, scalable, low risk yield, and to do strategic RWA deals with Arrangers that are clustering to one of the two Protectors, in the interest of supporting the momentum of the Protectors.  This is a subproposal MIP to the Strategic Finance Core Unit Mandate It authorises the Strategic Finance Core Unit to temporarily make RWA onboarding proposals at will that help facilitate the Endgame Plan and the Protector Clustering. The Strategic Finance Core Unit needs to follow best practice and obtain adequate assesments from relevant experts, such as legal and credit risk, when it is relevant. Collateral onboarding is prioritized by the Facilitator solely based on what they consider in the best interest of Maker, without having to adhere to an external prioritization process. This power is useable by the Strategic Finance Facilitator without requiring any process or bureaucracy beyond the judgement of the Facilitator.   4.2 Collateral Onboarding Mandate amendment for Risk Core Unit In order to ensure continuity, as well as simplification, of collateral onboarding, the mandate to prioritize collateral onboarding and propose collateral onboarding governance polls and executive votes is added to the Risk core unit for the limited types of Collateral that are permissible in Maker Core in the Endgame Plan, including ETH and ETH related collateral, major Altcoins, D3Ms, and PSMs  This is a Subproposal to the Risk Core Unit Mandate It authorises the Risk Core Unit to make collateral onboarding proposals that relate to ETH, or ETH-derived collateral (such as LP tokens or Staked ETH), Major Altcoins (with a revenue potential of at least 1 million per year), D3Ms, and stablecoin PSMs The Risk Core Unit needs to follow best practice and obtain adequate assesments from relevant experts, including smart contracts and oracles when it is relevant. Collateral onboarding is prioritized by the Facilitator solely based on what they consider in the best interest of Maker, without having to adhere to an external prioritization process. This power is useable by the Risk Facilitator without requiring any process or bureaucracy beyond the judgement of the Facilitator.   5. Protocol Owned Vault Emulation activation The Protocol Owned Vault is a key element of the Endgame Plan that helps achieve real resilience and decentralization by increasing the amount of Dai backed by Staked ETH. It is crucial to begin accumulatinng protocoled owned Staked ETH as quickly as possible, because this will enable the protocol to buy at a slower pace, reducing the risks of the activity. The Protocol Owned Vault Emulation means using the ability of surplus buffer to have negative lower limit to emulate a Protocol Owned Vault, and this way enable Maker Governance to immediately begin accumulating Staked ETH without requiring any new technology.  This MIP will activate the Protocol Owned Vault Emulation The Protocol Owned Vault Emulation will be manually administered by the Strategic Finance Core Unit through proposals to Maker Governance 40 million Dai from the Surplus Buffer will be used as starting collateral for the Protocol Owned Vault If the optional LDO Swap MIP is approved, the starting collateral will be a total of 76 million USD worth of assets. The collateralization ratio of the protocol owned vault is 225%, equivalent to 1.8x leverage(?) This means the protocol owned vault will have a debt of 60 million initially, which is emulated by setting the lower limit of the Surplus Buffer to -60 million. 100 million Dai (40 millionn starting collateral + 60 million debt) is transferred from the Surplus Buffer to the Pause Proxy. The 100 million Dai is used to accumulate Lido Staked ETH at a rate of 500,000 Dai per day. Strategic Finance will have the temporary responsibility to monitor and propose halting or changing the parameters of the Protocol Owned Vault accumulation strategy with no delay (can be done directly with governance poll followed by executive vote)   6. Budget Reduction  6.1 Strategic happiness offboarding  MIP to offboard Strategic Happiness Core Unit with standard severance bonus   6.2 Events offboarding  MIP to offboard Events Core Unit with standard severance bonus   6.3 Real World Finance offboarding  MIP to offboard Real World Finance Core Unit with standard severance bonus   6.4 Future Reductions  This item is not a MIP, but by approving the Endgame Plan MIP Set the community signals its intention to significantly reduce the recurring budget of Maker Core, with a soft aim of reaching less than 22.5 million per year (a 50% reduction from current levels of 45 million). This will be achieved by reorganizing core units into MetaDAOs that will have to earn their own income (Which is already covered by the Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters specified above), or letting go of contributors aren\u2019t needed to directly work on any of the key priorities of the Endgame Plan or the Launch MetaDAOs.

Considering the majority of your delegators voted against the offboarding (and other MKR holders) why does it seem appropriate to propose another offboarding directly after a failed offboarding vote? How do you see the result changing this time?  Our CUs activities are directed towards promotion and brand awareness for Maker which is completely independent of the Endgame Plan or any other direction the DAO may take. While delegates\u2019 past votes don\u2019t guarantee future support.  Barring any performance issue with our CU I\u2019m not sure how delegates\u2019 votes will differ in 2 months. The more direct question here is @rune do you plan on un-delegating your MKR to ensure such a MIP passes? Also, tagging @Recognized-Delegates as your feedback here would be appreciated as you just voted on this exact issue. ",

There is a large and established professional validator industry which MKR can leverage as well as established models for managing them (Lido and others) that we could emulate. This would be better for MKR and for Ethereum as a whole.   As Lyt already mentioned, this is actually exactly the plan - but through an even more advanced product than just a liquid staking token, which is to use a synthetic asset (basically a stablecoin pegged to ETH with liquid staking tokens in PSMs). This product is called EtherDai II, or alternatively just Synthetic Assets, and would be available in Midgame (so maybe after 3-5 years). Once we have EtherDai II we can take the final step and also back a part of it with ETH staked with our oracle network (which in the endgame plan has massively improved security and decentralization because the work is outsourced to the metadaos with major incentives). This would not happen until the Endgame in the current roadmap, which means it could 5+ years out. So before we can get to those very attractive end results in the Midgame and Endgame, we need to immediately accumulate users and build momentum for the product, and that\u2019s the role of EtherDai I, which needs to be as simple as possible so that it fits into the Pregame - hence the logical choice is to build a simple wrapper around Staked ETH. The reality is that we already have existential exposure to Lido Staked ETH - if it gets fully compromised Ethereum dies, regardless of what action we take in the short run. We may as well support it and try to improve its security and prevent it from getting compromised. This is the same logic that is applied to Pigeon Stance and USDC and RWA exposure. There is no realistic path to immediately get out of it in the very short run, so we may as well double down and get as much value out of it as possible, so we can accumulate resources and capital for the time when actually building something more diversified and resilient becomes realistic.

                    "content": "I have been working on the MIPs and will post most of them in a few hours. Any that remain will be posted tomorrow to ensure they all can enter RFC and be edited to completion in time for the October voting cycle. My top concern is obviously that we can smoothly and unambiguously approve and execute the Endgame Plan, including doing the necessary restructuring the workforce. The biggest risk of all isn\u2019t that the Endgame Plan is rejected, but rather that it is neither unambiguously approved or rejected - the only thing more dangerous than being stuck in the status quo is if we flip flop after initially activating elements of the Endgame Plan. To reduce any possibility of uncertainty around this I will be pooling all of my MKR votes into a shadow delegate account during this initial voting period, and will be voting for all the proposals - including the optional LDO to MKR swap proposal. Edit: In practice I will keep MKR on delegates that I can be certain are going to vote in favour of the proposal, but the outcome should be expected up front to be equivalent to voting in favour with all my MKR. I think the LDO to MKR swap is particularly crucial to deal with the risk of a flip-flopping scenario as it will create a \u201clock-in\u201d effect (both real but also game theoretically) by increasing my own voting power. This ensures that any attempts to reject the Endgame Plan will have to happen now, rather than become extremely damaging attempts to overturn the Endgame Plan later after it has already been approved. Additionally, while the LDO to MKR swap MIP remains optional, I will implement a strategy to prevent the approval of the Endgame Plan MIPs if they are not approved with a significant margin (more than 25k MKR) and the LDO to MKR swap is not approved. So it will still be possible to reject the LDO to MKR swap MIP, but if it is rejected then the Endgame Plan will only be approved and locked in if the other MIPs are then approved with a clear approving majority. To further help address concerns that it is not favourable for Maker to swap MKR for LDO I have changed the exchange rate modifiers to be even more in the favour of Maker to make it more of a no-brainer. The exchange rate modifier schedule that will be included in the MIP is pasted below:  Increase to LDO per MKR exchange rate based on relative exchange rates:  MKR/LDO 751+ = +10% MKR/LDO 701-750 = +15% MKR/LDO 651-700 = +20% MKR/LDO 601-650 = +25% MKR/LDO 551-600 = +30% MKR/LDO 501-550 = +35% MKR/LDO 451-500 = +41% MKR/LDO 401-450 = +47% MKR/LDO 351-400 = +53% MKR/LDO 301-350 = +59% MKR/LDO 251-300 = +65% MKR/LDO 201-250 = +71% MKR/LDO 151-200 = +77% MKR/LDO 101-150 = +83% MKR/LDO 51-100 = +90% MKR/LDO 1-50 = +100%    So with this set of modifiers at the current rate of 372 LDO per MKR the modifier would be +53% resulting in an actual rate of 569 LDO per MKR. I personally expect this rate to change a lot over the next 2 months that the proposal will actually play out, and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the MKR price increases relative to LDO during this period as many of the upsides of the Endgame Plan become better understood by the market. The final rate that will be executed by the MIP, if it is approved, will be the exact rate at the moment voting stops and the MIP passes. ",

I think you may be better off either (1) pulling all delegations into a shadow delegate contract to vote directly, or (2) leaving all delegations unchanged, but committing to pull delegations from any delegates that vote against your preferred outcomes. Selectively pulling votes from some delegates beforehand might have a negative impact on the reputations / perceived independence of the remaining delegates who retain your voting power support.     rune:  I think the LDO to MKR swap is particularly crucial to deal with the risk of a flip-flopping scenario as it will create a \u201clock-in\u201d effect (both real but also game theoretically) by increasing my own voting power.   Have to admit this makes me a bit uncomfortable. But on the other hand I think LDO is a strategically valuable asset with strong fundamentals, and the pricing you laid out does seem to include a reasonable control premium. If you are planning to take an even larger stake of MKR in the protocol (potentially enough to push through votes near unilaterally), I\u2019d appreciate a commitment to not increase the ESM threshold above the existing 150k limit (and maybe even to consider reducing the threshold). If EMS threshold is increased higher under these circumstances, the value and rights of minority holders of MKR is put into doubt. ",
