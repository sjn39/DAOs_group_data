                    "content": "With the high transaction fees caused by the rise in the overall price of Ethereum, Ethereum network applications are gradually transferred to other such as binance smart chain, Tron and heco. I propose to focus on optimizing the smart contract fees in the subsequent upgrading process To solve this problem, my optimization idea is  The Ethereum main network compensates the gas usage fees involved in contract transactions. The fixed rate of client handling fees has been realized, and eth can be returned in proportion to the actual usage rate In the smart contract interface, the block function provides the actual use parameters of the current transaction. The DAPP application team can make token compensation according to the user\u2019s actual use of gas For example: Bob deploys a smart contract. According to the gasused cost of the block function, the main network outputs 80% eth from the 0x0 address and returns it to Bob\u2019s wallet address Alice initiates a transaction with Bob\u2019s contract address, and Bob\u2019s contract address returns the corresponding service charge to Alice according to the calculated service charge proportion If this scheme can be passed, Ethereum\u2019s ecological application will be steadily improved. From the advent of bitcoin to the subsequent emergence of various main chains, many application teams are deterred by the high handling fees and switch to other places. Now Ethereum is facing this problem, which I think needs to be solved urgently Second question The wisper project in Ethereum network seems to be at a standstill and is not supported by most providers. On the premise of decentralization, I think we should provide users with a fee free contract interface method for users to share real-time chat data This method only does data transmission without storage. If the contract administrator requires storage, a certain gas fee will be charged. I hope to receive the latest message from the chain in a getter like manner, and then wait for the next message to load  ",

                    "content": "I\u2019m not talking about reducing the network service charge directly from the chain link. It\u2019s just a compensation measure, Compensation measures include two aspects, which I have mentioned in the article The first way is to realize compensation through the main chain. In order to stabilize the use of network fees, the main chain can verify the actual use fees when the transaction is packaged on the chain, and then wake up the compensation mechanism for fee conversion. It creates a compensation fee from the \u201c0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\u201d address to msg.sender A simple code verification, the actual expansion should be much more complex if(block.gasUsed > fixedPoint || block.GasUsed.mul(fixedPoint.div(100))){ super._mint(msg.sender, block.gasUsed.sub(fixedPoint)); // or  super._mint(msg.sender, block.gasUsed.mul(fixedPoint.div(100))); }  The second scheme is to open the service charge field to the block for the contract. At present, the block structure is as follows { blockHash: \"0x0\", coinbase: \"0x0\", difficulty: \"0x0\", gaslimit: \"0x0\", number: \"0x0\", timestamp: \"0x0\" }  I think we should add an extra field to the block that actually consumes eth. The contract creator can provide service fee compensation according to this field, which can be selected by the contract creator and sent to msg.sender According to the actual operation needs of the project party, Ethereum can be returned directly or compensated to the user in token or other forms About the second scheme I just saw someone tx.gasPrice And gasleft() Two functions provide support, but how to use them remains to be verified ",
