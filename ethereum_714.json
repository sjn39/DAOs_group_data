This means having some people do security reviews \u2013 which might mean engaging external auditors. But it also means communication around the Core EIP proposals that are effectively Last Call, but focused on security issues. Pay attention, have a look, does this impact your current or future use cases. I\u2019ve suggested 2019-06-21 (June 21st), this is half way between the hard deadline for proposals, and the soft deadline for major client implementations. ",

Otherwise the time will drag on, and review will only happen just before the hard fork (and it does nowadays). ",

This proposal is adapted from the IETF\u2019s Request for Comments (RFC) system (RFC 7322 - Section 4.8.5) where this is mandatory already.  The Meta EIP is currently in Draft status. We would love to get you involved making \u2026     I think embedding the security considerations into the EIP itself is important. ",
