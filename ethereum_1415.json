This involves a group of people managing the assets together in a democratic way. I have created a high level contract standard for these kind of scenarios. But before that wanted to check if there is any existing standard for the same and also wanted to get your opinion whether such a generic standard will be useful for the community?

This is needed when the contract need to buy/possess assets by transferring funds. The funding by multiple people is challenging as today most of it is done based only on trust. The following proposal addresses it in an elegant manner Proposal Have an Escrow contract (which is deployed by the multi party contract) to which users can transfer funds. Once transferred only the user/multi party contract can withdraw funds from the escrow contract Have a method to withdraw funds in the multi party contract. Then create a funding action like below to fund the contract Action : withdraw(address1, 1) withdraw(address2, 1) Before this step, the users have to fund the escrow. Once the action is executed the multi party contract gets funded by the escrow in a secure manner ",
