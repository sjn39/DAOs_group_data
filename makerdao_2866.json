                    "content": "Polls are at the end of the post. Following the post on the Centrifuge Model, I want to discuss more about the covenant part and get community sentiment about it (two polls at the end of this post). I expect this concept to be used for most RWA vaults where the token (S in the schema below) is just a tokenized illiquid debt on a legal entity in the real world (the Special Purpose Vehicle, SPV) which owns a portfolio of loans (for real estate, inventory, \u2026).  What is a covenant? A covenant is a promise in an indenture, or any other formal debt agreement, that certain activities will or will not be carried out and/or that certain thresholds will be met. Having a loan on the SPV, we want to have some control on what the SPV is doing. A covenant therefore is a set of rules, that, if breached leads to Maker action. In general that would be triggering the vault liquidation. The covenant is an integral part of the risk assessment, negotiated with the asset originator and that governance agrees on. When is a covenant used? The covenant is periodically assessed (quarterly or monthly depending on the collateral). It is also assessed for every debt ceiling increase. In the Centrifuge model that can happen frequently as it\u2019s the best way to control what is done with the borrowed funds. With the Trust model, the control, operation per operation, is delegated to the Trust trustees (which are overwatched by the Maker Representatives). So Maker Representatives will make sure that those rules are followed. Is the covenant application discretionary of mandatory? Usually a covenant breach leads to a liquidation mechanism (just like any failure to keep the colletarization ratio high enough in a crypto vault). By default, if the risk team find a covenant breach, they are mandated by MakerDAO to trigger the liquidation (an executive vote might be needed depending on the actual implementation). Nevertheless, some easy to solve breaches or unexpected events can lead to an unwanted liquidation. Therefore, a mandated actor can suspend the liquidation and emit a signal request to avoid liquidating the vault by an executive vote. Depending on the actual mechanism (if the liquidation is easily reversible or not), the liquidation is either triggered then suspended or never triggered at all before the executive vote. Covenant structure The covenant regulates those following parts:  Allowed investments Minimum overcollateralization ratio Concentration risk Stakeholders rules  Allowed investments The first rule set will be the investment that the SPV can do. For instance a ConsolFreight SPV can only invest in freight shipping invoices that are due in less than 90 days. That would basically be given by the MIP6 application. Contrary to a crypto vault, where you can only put ETH in a ETH vault (limited by the smart contract), the SPV isn\u2019t bound by any program (managed by humans). That part is easy. Nevertheless, details are important as for instance ConsolFreight is now using Centrifuge Series for freight shipping invoices but also cargo, which is a different kind of loan (on the item being shipped not the service of shipping). Minimum overcollateralization ratio The second part of a covenant is about the liquidation ratio. As introduced in the beginning of this post, the vault is filled with a token representing the promise of the vault owner to pay DAI in the future (with an interest rate). Therefore, the vault collateralization ratio is 100% (you get a loan of 100 DAI for every 100 DAI of debt, that\u2019s a tautology). Obviously, the protocol wants to make sure that at any time the loan is overcollateralized by the SPV assets. The senior tranche of the SPV (the tokenized debt) has priority on the SPV assets on liquidation. Therefore, if SPV assets are greater than the SPV debt, we are safe. The SPV assets are composed of loans and liquidity. Loans should be valued. For instance, Centrifuge has an embedded method to evaluate a loan portfolio. Even liquidity should be evaluated as the SPV can have dollars and not DAI (therefore the conversion rate should be either the market rate of 1 DAI = $1). If the asset value is lower than the agreed upon collateralization rate, the risk team will trigger the liquidation. Concentration risks The last section covers the concentration risks. For instance, we might want to avoid having a portfolio of 100 loans made only to one entity. That would defeat the whole point of diversification of risk. We might want the minimum overcollateralization ratio to be still true even if one counterparty defaults. If the underlying is real estate, we might want to avoid having more than 25% in a specific city. We might also want that no counterparty has a risk exposure greater than the equity part of the SPV. Concentration risk is a challenge in the beginning, as the first loan for SPV will breach this rule (as there is only one debtor). Therefore, these rules will apply only at scale (a predefined amount) or with a ratio that depends on the amount borrowed. Again, failure to comply with those rules will trigger the liquidation from the risk domain team/Maker representatives. Stakeholders rules The previous sections are about the soundness of the SPV\u2019s investments. Nevertheless elements outside of this scope can affect the risk of making a loan to this SPV. The diagram below shows all stakeholders that can gravitate around an SPV (excluding SPV borrowers) 1029\u00d7576 26.2 KB Depending on the collateral, some stakeholders from the diagram can be missing or a given entity can have multiple roles. For instance, 6S Capital doesn\u2019t have co-investors, while the Centrifuge Model requires co-investors. In some cases, the equity investor will be the asset originator, sometimes it wont. Nevertheless, there can be conditions on each stakeholder that, if not fulfilled, lead to a liquidation. Asset originator As the asset originator manages the SPV (bringing deal flow and managing the loans), it is of paramount importance that the asset originator is in good financial shape and without a major legal risk. A discretionary review by the Maker risk team should be performed to ensure that the asset originator can remain in business for the next 12 months. We should also be careful that the asset originator manages the SPV in the most fair way. For instance, if the asset originator manages multiple SPV that can have the same kind of assets, we don\u2019t want to end up with the worse performing ones while the other SPV gets the best ones. Token issuance platform The token issuance platform is in charge of bridging the gap between the SPV debt and the debt token (for instance the DROP token in the Centrifuge model). It can be technological and/or legal. For instance, in the Trust model, the SPV debt is managed by the trust that itself uses other entities (the Tax Efficient Entity and the OTC Broker Dealer) to operate the Maker vault. Some rules (financials and/or technological) should be defined to ensure that those stakeholder will continue to make the system work. Equity investors In the SPV, the first to have a loss are the equity investors. We might have a rule that the asset originator needs to own part of the equity in order to have skin in the game. The ratio of equity versus debt should already be taken care of in the Minimum overcollateralization ratio. Co-investors For collaterals that use the Centrifuge model, there will also be a co-investor ratio for the senior tranche tranche tokens. Indeed, we expect co-investors to enforce the contract if need be. We might want to ask for co-investors to hold at least 25% of the tokenized debt amount. Polls Do you agree on having a discretionary liquidation? This is big difference from crypto vaults where there is a liquidation and no way to discuss the matter before action. It is our opinion that such way makes more sense for real world assets (closer to what already exist in the real world).     yes no abstain     0 voters     Do you agree with the concept of covenants? The covenant structure is a centerpiece on how we intend to handle real world assets. Therefore I want to see if the community agrees with it. A lot of work is done off-chain even if the idea is to automate a maximum of it. Poll recreated as there was no public results.     yes no abstain     0 voters     ",

Anyway it looks like Matthew is aiming for discretionary application through Report back to the community the abstracted summary of the above:  Fully Compliant Compliant with minor comments. Material Breach - Not in compliance.  So in his setup there will be a discussion around the rules/covenant, not any mandatory action. I think it is adviceable to at least start out this way and then later change to mandatory later as part of an automation process. There could be so many \u201cforce majeure\u201d issues in the beginning that mandatory action is not practical. ",

                    "content": "It\u2019s close to the list that @mrabino1 provided. I\u2019m mainly trying to generalize a bit what they are bringing. I hope we expect to have >10 asset originators next year and it will be simpler to understand if there isn\u2019t >10 frameworks. We are also working on a risk assessment template for illiquid RWA where the covenant is one part and really take over most vault parameters. So basically, I\u2019m saying that what was in the vault smart contract with parameters is now a covenant that is enforced off-chain. Quite a move for Maker. I don\u2019t see any other way for RWA but I still want to highlight that to the community and governance. The covenant structure is a really important piece of agreement between the asset originator and MakerDAO. It\u2019s a gentleman agreement (as we don\u2019t sign contracts) so anyone should expect that those rules will be followed. You can\u2019t unilaterally define a new rule after that. The Maker community may, or may not, want to enter in such agreements with asset originators. That\u2019s the intent of the second question. For discretionary liquidations, I\u2019m not sure about that. The process is not described in the @mrabino1 post. But if Maker representatives finds a major breach, the intent is most likely to trigger the liquidation. You are assuming that Maker Representatives can assess the gravity of the breach. If the collateral ratio is 104% and the threshold is 105% there is no subjectivity it\u2019s a Material Breach - Not in compliance. But if 6S capital is committed to add equity to the SPV in the next few days, then we might to suspend the liquidation. But that\u2019s not the role of the Maker Representative to decide. He is given a covenant agreement and he has to check the rules one by one. Only Maker Governance can decide if a breach is serious or not. You might call it a process detail, but some might see it differently. Again, I\u2019m highlighting the question and proposing a process that the community and governance can agree or not. PS: Just saw that the second form is not with public vote. I will change that. Sorry for those that voted already. ",
