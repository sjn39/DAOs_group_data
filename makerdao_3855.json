To choose a winner, MakerDAO\u2019s Content Production Core Unit is sponsoring an art contest! The winning logo will decide what the mascot should be.    Grand Prize: 400 Dai + Swag Runners up: Dai + Swag Email your submission(s) and ETH address to [email\u00a0protected]  Deadlines Submissions will be accepted until July 31. After July 31, we\u2019ll create a post in the Maker Forum to let the community narrow down the top 10 submissions, which will then be put to a poll to decide the winner. Runners-up will be announced August 15 Winners will be announced August 31  Capybara vs Dragon  Team Capybara A number of community members have rallied behind the friendly capybara, making a strong case for its personality fit. Just look at them! They\u2019re like the Zen Mammal.  706\u00d7459 224 KB Capybaras are sociable pack creatures that tend to play nice. Native to South America, the Capybara goes by several names, depending on who you ask:   Capivara in Brazil.   Capiguara in Bolivia.   Chig\u00fcire in Venezuela and Colombia   Carpincho in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay   And Ronsoco in Peru   What is unique is how they make-up that pack. The capybara is an incredibly inclusive animal that regularly co-exists alongside any number of water dwellers. That inclusiveness is an idea that perfectly aligns with the Maker Protocol\u2019s support of banking the unbanked. In South America, around 70% of the population is unbanked or underbanked and serving these individuals aligns with the vision and values of many in the Maker community.  Team Dragon According to Rune Christensen, the founder of MakerDAO, Dai was originally named after the world\u2019s first paper currency, the Chinese JIAO \u4ea4 (ji\u0101o), which means, to exchange. Unfortunately the character for jiao (\u4ea4) can also be used to represent intercourse\u2026 so he pivoted, eventually settling on d\u00e0i (\u8cb8), meaning, to lend or to provide capital. With a name rooted in ancient Chinese history, the Chinese dragon certainly makes for a fitting mascot. Aside from that - It just fits. Picture an ancient dragon as the Keeper of the Maker Vaults. Others point to accessibility as the dragon\u2019s primary advantage:  753\u00d7131 11.5 KB  Whichever direction you\u2019re leaning, show the Community how you envision Maker\u2019s new mascot. Your hard work may end up representing the movement!  Submit today! Send your submissions and ETH address to [email\u00a0protected]. ",
