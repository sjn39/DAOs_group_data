As you may already know, we post snippets along with in-depth semi-transcribed summaries of the Governance and Risk weekly meetings. My question to everyone is whether you would like to have something similar applied to the other calls and meetings? Some of them may not require an in-depth summary; Maybe more people would prefer to have snippets or relatively shorter editorial-styled summaries? Which of the following do you believe would benefit from snippets or any type of summaries? If there is an option that is not listed, feel free to comment on it. If anybody has any thoughts or ideas on this topic in general, I would love to hear them. Below is a polled list of various public calls and meetings. Answers are not limited to only one. Thanks!

What I would like to have is some automated transcript so the meeting is available in text format. In case I am interested in let\u2019s say \u201cMIP33\u201d I could just  open the file and search it for \u201cMIP33\u201d and know immediately if the topic was discussed or not and what was said about it. Is there no app for this anywhere? ",

There are AI applications for this but so far the ones that he had tried are unable to accurately transcribe the terminology we use. Also, the formatting is very jumbled, but that should only matter to people who actually want to carefully read that transcript. One idea can be to find an application that works well and then have a reviewer do a quality assessment check for terminology. If anybody knows of an app or software that they would like for us to try us, send it our way =) ",

It certainly has some flaws in the auto transcript generation but learns your corrections over time. It can also create hashtags that relate to certain clips/summaries so anyone who listens to calls could just hashtag topics / seems that would be searchable. (ie. MIP33). Happy to walk you through the basics of using the tool if you decide to use it. ",

We could probably do more in-depth transcriptions for the top 2 or 3 calls that have the most activity. For the remaining calls, I am trying to see if we can integrate some automated service and then just have one reviewer clean it up and prep for posting. I\u2019m just brainstorming at the moment but thank\u2019s to everyone for their opinions and ideas! ",

The purpose of this poll is to find out what are the top 3 being requested and then create an efficient workflow from there. At the moment, I don\u2019t want to involve more work than contributors can handle as well as keeping in mind the budget especially being that the Gov Communications CU hasn\u2019t yet moved into the Executive. Don\u2019t want to throw on too much on the plate before we know exactly how large that plate will be =P ",
