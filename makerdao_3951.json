                    "content": " Context Following the work that we are @christiancdpetersen is doing on designing a legal structure for RWA (here and here), we are soon to release the documents describing a Cayman Foundation and a MIP to formalize the communication between the DAO and the Cayman Foundation (the WIP MIP is located here but not finished yet). While SolarX is used for the proof of concept, this structure could be used for most RWA collaterals where the MIP6 isn\u2019t addressing the legal structure. This component should speed up RWA onboarding a lot. This post is a way to get feedback from the community on the overall structure and on some open questions in order to be able to change the structure if needed. What is presented here is already the 3rd iteration. I would recommend that we keep it high level, leaving discussion on details with the MIP post (which should go live in early August).  Description The overall structure is to have a Cayman Foundation holding SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicle), most likely one per project. The SPV will be simple structures like member-managed Delaware LLC (i.e. the Cayman Foundation controls and manage the SPV). The Cayman Foundation is the bridge between the real world and DeFi (Maker Protocol and MakerDAO).  image592\u00d7511 5.95 KB  For the management, the current plan is to have servicing companies taking the role of supervisor and director (those are distinct roles, but we can summarize that both run the Foundation). How much power they will have is a discussion point. Nevertheless, while it remains to be seen what they agree to do, one can expect that they will not take any non-obvious action anyway and request guidance. Those servicing companies can be supplemented by a committee of MakerDAO members. Those will be able to instruct the directors to act on some predefined items. They will not have any power to represent the Foundation by themselves. Here is a list of actions we suggest the committee could instruct the directors  Notify the borrower of a default; Take any time-sensitive measures to protect lender rights; Immaterial (non-monetary) waivers under financing agreements; Immaterial (non-monetary) amendments under financing agreements; Administrative matters to maintain SPV security (UCC filings, renewals); Authorize payments of administrative fees, costs and expenses for loan management.  There are also some items that the servicing companies will not want to carry, especially for things that are outside of their jurisdiction. For that, we introduce the authorized signers. Authorized signers can sign for the Foundation for things that are delegated to them. It can be a one-time delegation (like open a bank account) or something open-ended. There is also a cost element to it as using directors to do things might be way more expensive.  Discussion points  How much control does the DAO want to keep? It is our view that we need at least to give delegate power to supervisors and directors to pay the bills and do whatever is need to keep the lights on in the Cayman Foundation (and the underlying SPVs). More tricky is the power delegation to the committee and the authorized signers. We can make that evolve with time. But do we start a bit too wide to get things running or by not even having a committee nor authorized signers? If MakerDAO confirms 6S in the interim, should we start with similar specific powers to authorized signers? Who should be on the committee? Who should be authorized signers?  Is a MakerDAO executive the source of truth? The proposed structure gives full power to MakerDAO through executed spells. We haven\u2019t figured any reason why that would be risky but this is a point that worries me. But if someone can execute a MakerDAO spell against the will of MKR holders, what happens for the Foundation is probably not our main problem. A provision like having the ability for the committee to delay directors\u2019 actions by one week might be enough. Happy to have other thoughts on this one.  What if MakerDAO goes dark? There is a plan to add resolutions for the case where MakerDAO is not responding or is no longer alive. For instance, if MakerDAO fails to appoint a director that is resigning, the supervisor will appoint an interim director (and vice-versa).  Should we have many Foundations? I would say one is enough as it is unclear what protection have duplicate bring. This reduces cost (as a % of \u201cassets under management\u201d) as well with scale. But it doesn\u2019t cost much to leave room for an upgraded version of the legal construct. Happy to discuss others topics as well related to this legal structure. ",

In my view, it will expedite matters if the borrower proposes a thought-out and well structured transaction. It is critical for the borrowers to be proactive in structuring the deal (this is not the same as being aggressive). Using the FoundationCo and a Delaware LLC as the \u201clender\u201d is very easy. Setting up a new Delaware LLC owned by FoundationCo for each transaction takes very little time. ",

I guess I\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around what distinguishes Maker as a lender for RWA projects versus traditional alternatives. In my understanding there are few things: (1) Economic incentives: The rate of the loan is obviously a huge factor, and maybe projects are ready to absorb some element of \u201cDeFi\u201d risk for lower rates. This also may include the other costs of doing business. (2) Regulatory incentives: Maybe the borrower cannot use traditional facilities due to its history, track record (or lack thereof), few things that maybe Maker can waive due to its flexibility in procedures. (3) Ideological/Psychological incentives: The borrower might be interested in doing business with a crypto-native project due to personal interests or as an experiment.  There also might be some advantages in partnering with a DAO? Finally, there is always a component that borrowers might be onboarded by individuals they trust that are already part of Maker (I believe this is what @g_dip does?) (4) Process incentives: This is what I\u2019m interested in figuring out. Does Maker want to distinguish itself by its ease of process and speed? If complications are required due to Maker being a DAO, then other elements should be stronger. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it seems like Maker can offer competitive rates and still turn a profit due to its low cost base. Hence, priority should be targeted towards economic incentives and not simplifying the process at the cost of safety in controls. I\u2019m not a lawyer so I don\u2019t understand everything \u201cprocess-wise\u201d but that would be my initial reaction. Anyone feel free to chime in. I will also ask people I know in the solar business who went through traditional facilities about what they think. ",

I would say that besides the cost you also have the risk of mismanaging many Foundations. Hard to keep track of everything. The purpose of the Cayman Foundation is to use a great legal system. And yeah, that allows us to enforce creditors\u2019 rights (but any legal entity would solve that). @NH98 I would say it\u2019s a bit nuanced. Most of the people we are speaking with are crypto enthusiasts. Some are fairly small and wouldn\u2019t be able to get proper funding. Securitization works starting from 50M and banks loans would be expensive and complicated to get. Others are bigger and there is a PR component to it. At least 2 are willing to provide better term that what they would get because it\u2019s PR and strategic. But process is super complex right now. Legal and structuring part is not easy. Governance is quite stressful (maybe gates where it\u2019s unclear how the decision is taken). This is somewhat counterbalanced with the fact that we provide credit facility and when you get one, we don\u2019t ask to much on a deal per deal basis. I think our strategic advantage is not so much in economics and clearly not in the process. It\u2019s that we provide access to a new source of capital, DeFi. While we can compete on economics right now (as we have 60% USDC), this will not work at scale. ",

Beijing is pursuing other goals: reining in the power of its tech titans and boosting startups; protecting social equality; and making sure the cost of living in cities isn\u2019t so high that families aren\u2019t willing to have children. And Beijing is suspicious of companies that are skilled at raising capital overseas\u2014beyond its watchful eye. There\u2019s one practice it\u2019s especially concerned about: a variable interest entity (VIE) corporate structure commonly deployed by the hottest unicorns.

I somewhat think developing a general (yet hopefully specific and detailed) framework for control, governance, enforcement, delegation, tax intent, licensing/regulatory etc etc for how the DAO would like to manage RWA\u2019s generally would be good idea. I have a sense that, given the broader aspirations for RWA growth and diversity, there will ultimately be numerous legal structures - each handling certain unique issues with certain specific RWA opportunities. Seems more likely than trying to fit all into a few \u2018swiss army knife\u2019 structures - at the very least here at the beginning of this RWA strategy. Many of the RWA projects today seem to be proposed with unique legal structures already as far as I can tell. By developing above robust framework, it would be easier to provide guidance to the RWA projects - and ultimately easier to make an informed decisions on these RWA projects by the community. (now obviously if this framework already exist, please do point me to it and forgive my lack of such basic knowledge - I am still novice here) ",
