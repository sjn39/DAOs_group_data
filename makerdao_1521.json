                    "content": "RWF-0x - 07/22 Real World Asset Report Authors: @teej @Eumenes @christiancdpetersen As of: 8/03/2022 Preamble On May 7, 2022, RWF-001 last published an April report on the Forum, detailing RWA vault performance and RWF activities. This report was prompted, compiled, and finalized entirely by @christiancdpetersen, @eumenes, @teej, and @luca_pro and after strong prompting was posted by the RWF facilitator on the Forum. Outside of @teej\u2019s HVB-related reporting and @christiancdpetersen\u2019s legal-related reporting, there has been no reporting from RWF-001. We, as prospective RWF-0x, believe that it is important to include the community and MKR holders in the activities of the core unit, especially given the complexity and strategic value of RWF. As such, please see the below July Report broken out by existing vaults, green-lit vaults, newly onboarded vaults, and prospective vaults. An approved RWF-0x core unit will provide the community and MKR holders with monthly reporting of this form in addition to greater transparency and engagement going forward. Assisted by our colleagues at @collateral-core-unit and @data-insights-cu, RWF-0x hopes to bring to RWAs the same transparency and visibility that DAI/MKR holders are accustomed to on the crypto-native side. Summary   Existing Vaults: Active RWA vaults, totalling 40,076,113.92 DAI in principal outstanding, continue to perform well despite a sustained downturn in risk assets, both external and internal to crypto.  Green-Lit Vaults: Green-lit vaults include OPM ATDC and MIP 65 Monetalis Clydesdale (a split SF/RWF initiative) while a New Silver debt ceiling increase request was given the nod by signal request.  OPM ATDC is at loggerheads on price\u2014an external specialist has advised that, as per the risks present, MakerDAO ought to require a higher interest rate compared to the current ATDC offer. RWF0x, if approved, will work with MKR token holders for a clearer and/or more directed pricing mandate. RWF-0x will, if approved, continue to dedicate resources to the structuring of Monetalis Clydesdale, a proposal to monetize up to 500MM of the MakerDAO PSM. NS has achieved confirmation via Signal Request for RWF to evaluate a debt ceiling increase.    Newly Onboarded Vaults: The executive for Societe Generale and Huntingdon Valley Bank collateral was passed yesterday. DAI will be minted against these collateral types tomorrow, August 4th. When these vaults go live, RWAs will account for 170MM of MakerDAO\u2019s collateral.  Prospective Vaults: Pando, Cabot Renewables, and Blocktower have submitted MIP-6 proposals while we expect Anchorage to post a MIP-6 for a hash-power backed lending facility shortly. The Pando green-light poll is currently live.   Screen Shot 2022-08-04 at 11.43.00 AM1920\u00d7384 94.7 KB  Existing Vaults Summary of Vault Statuses     Vault Debt Ceiling Current Exposure Comments     6S 15MM DAI 14,281,779.99 Performing. @GFXlabs initiated a signal request to modify the 6S stability fee to Prime - 25bps.   Centrifuge New Silver 20MM DAI 17,348,980.77 Performing. Signal request to dedicate RWF resources to DC increase successful here.   Centrifuge Consol Freight 2MM DAI 1,277,342.21 Performing. Consol Freight has utilized its vault significantly since May.   Centrifuge Harbor Trade Credit 7MM DAI 1,803,446.96 Performing. HTC secured a sizable TIN investor and has begun drawing on its vault.   Centrifuge FortunaFi 15MM DAI 5,364,563.99 Performing. FortunaFi has drawn down twice since the last RWF report, once in May and again in June, increasing total indebtedness to 5.36MM.    Adjusting to Market Conditions In late June, @teej assayed the community\u2019s interest in enhancing risk monitoring on and re-pricing existing RWA exposures, e.g. New Silver, 6S, ConsolFreight etc. When market conditions change, whether in terms of rates/risk premia or risk asset performance, a senior secured lender will take stock of its portfolio and adjust accordingly. A signal request titled \u201cWeather-Proofing Existing RWA Vaults Against Market Conditions\u201d was posted, allowing the community to elect how to proceed\u2014not at all, or to move towards an on-chain poll:  912\u00d7684 168 KB  Though no one option successfully achieved 50% of the vote when abstaining voters were factored out, the MKR community displayed interest in enhancing risk monitoring. This can be corroborated by summing the votes for \u201cYes to Both\u201d and \u201cYes to Risk Monitoring, No to Re-Pricing\u201d. These options combines received 77% of non-abstain votes. RWF-0x, if approved, will embark on a systematic review of all existing vaults and upgrade surveillance/reporting consistent with the standard put forth by the HVB structure. The goal will be to \u201cbring vaults forward\u201d to the new Maker Standard. This enhancement will be done with the advice of @collateral-core-unit and @data-insights-cu. Vault Parameter Changes Prospective RWF-0x members, in response to New Silver\u2019s debt ceiling increase, had started re-underwriting with (first time the current RWF-0x members are evaluating New Silver) extensive due diligence. Of course, a 100MM exposure presents a different level of credit risk to the protocol than a 20MM one. As such, RWF has begun work, including:  Legal Risk: Does the Indentured Trust structure, assisted by @christiancdpetersen, give Maker sufficient rights and remedies? Economic Risk: In a broad economic slow-down, do bridge-loans on primarily for-sale products pose outsized credit risk to the protocol? Unit Economics: Does the business model work with senior capital priced at market rate? Opportunity Cost: Do the tens of millions of DAI deployed here have a better use elsewhere? Risk Analysis: Is NS modeling its losses appropriately conservatively as per demand destruction and recent softness in residential sales? Does a sensitivity analysis  When approved, RWF-0x, will continue the due diligence, negotiation, and structuring of a potential debt ceiling increase. Greenlit Vaults     Vault Debt Ceiling Current Exposure Comments     Oasis Pro Markets - ATD Combustors 30MM 0 Green-lit by MKR holders. No alignment on indicative pricing/due diligence.   Monetalis Clydesdale 500MM 0 Green-lit by MKR holders. Legal evaluation and structuring forthcoming.   Backed Finance 500MM 0 Green-lit by MKR holders. Legal evaluation and structuring forthcoming.    Oasis Pro Markets Oasis Pro Markets - ATD Combustors was greenlit by MKR holders in May 2022. Due to the esoteric nature of the jurisdiction (Egypt/UAE) and asset type (heavy fuel furnace), @teej recommended that RWF enlist the expertise of an energy project finance professional who has contributed in good faith to the protocol in the past. Prospective RWF-0x members and an external specialist have been working in good faith with OPM. Usually a commercial deal will not enter the due diligence/negotiation phase until a working commercial premise is established. What this means is that both sides recognize that, as per the nature and inherent risk of the transaction, there\u2019s a certain window of commercially reasonable terms to work within. At the moment, OPM ATDC is at loggerheads on price\u2014the external specialist has advised that, as per the risks present, MakerDAO ought to require a higher interest rate compared to the current ATDC offer. RWF0x, if approved, will work with MKR token holders for a clearer and/or more directed pricing mandate. This is one of the nuances we aim to clear up once approved. i.e. Does RWF-0x have the authority to lean on its structured credit expertise to spearhead commercial negotiations for the benefit of MKR holders? Or does Maker prefer we sit in a more passive role? Treasury Management Initiatives - Clydesdale + Backed Finance RWF-0x, if approved, intends to prioritize, with both legal and commercial resources, both short-term treasury management strategies. We regard the monetization of the PSM as an existential issue needing immediate execution. The reasons such initiatives are so existential are: A) Impact: For a fairly minimal structural/negotiations lift, these initiatives drive serious revenue upside for the protocol. (If we assume a 1-year UST rate of 3.14% and 1B outstanding across Backed and Clydesdale, this translates into 31.4MM of revenue) B) Timing: If we are in fact entering recession, rates on US treasuries will not stay high forever. In fact, if we enter these positions now, they will appreciate as the Fed responds to weakening economic conditions with dovish policy Newly Onboarded Vaults Summary of Vault Statuses     Vault Debt Ceiling Current Exposure Comments     Societe Generale 30MM DAI 0 SocGen OFH covered bonds were approved as MakerDAO eligible collateral. SocGen Forge to decide its actual DAI minting date.]   Huntingdon Valley Bank 100MM DAI 0 HVB participations were approved as MakerDAO eligible collateral. First 1/4 of DAI will be minted on 8/4.    As of Tuesday 8/2, both HVB and SocGen were approved via Executive vote, bringing on 130MM of new eligible collateral. SocGen collateral is covered French residential real estate bonds. HVB collateral is commercial real estate loans, construction loans, business loans, residential real estate loans, and consumer loans. Given the unprecedented nature of both transactions, RWF-0x team members onboarded these deals swiftly and within a robust and defensible process. We regard the SocGen deal as a bellwether for the institutional deals to come\u2014prospective RWF-0x have noted an uptick in commercial inquiries since this deal was publicized. To be very clear, just because we can now onboard institutional RWAs does not mean we should. But unlike the past, our problem is now too many deals, not too few. Aside from on-boarding a new quantum and quality of collateral, the HVB structure serves as the market standard for how the real world and DeFi talk to one another. This set of innovations, from how token holders interact with collateral to how performance is transparently monitored, will only iterate from here. As we evaluate, structure, and negotiate new RWA vaults, we will ensure that each deal is better than the last. For a summary (not a 30 page risk memo!) of how the HVB deal works, we\u2019d direct your attention to this podcast. Go hop on an exercise bike or take a long walk in the August heat and try not to roll your eyes as @teej rants incessantly about RWAs. Prospective Vaults:     Vault Debt Ceiling Current Exposure Comments     Pando 210MM DAI 0 Pando, currently in greenlight voting, is seeking >200MM DAI to fund a pool of long-dated consumer solar loans   Cabot Renewables 12MM DAI 0 Cabot, a subsidiary of Exos, is seeking 5-year DAI funding against BTC mining machines in Paraguay.   Blocktower 150MM DAI 0 MIP-6 filed to onboard short-term asset-backed credit via Centrifuge   Anchorage Unknown 0 Anchorage Digital has expressed an intent to explore commercial opportunities with MakerDAO, specifically within the hash-power backed loan space. A MIP-6 will follow imminently.    New Horizons As we can see based on ALL of these prospective vaults, the average quality of deal/asset manager seeking funding via Maker has gone through the roof. Maker is in a position of strength now\u2014we\u2019ve demonstrated a consistent ability to execute on structured credit. From here on, every deal should be an improvement upon the last. RWF-0x, if approved, will continue proving that Maker is worthy of a seat at the future of innovation, both on the crypto and real world sides. ",

Our goal with respect to this report is not to merely to report on our activities, but to deliver a monthly snapshot of RWF that is actually useful to token holders, the community, and prospective/existing originators. We know that RWAs are not the simplest nor the most interesting (to many\u2014of course, to us they are), so feedback that will actually get these reports read is most welcome. ",
