                    "content": "Since we\u2019ve just received the very first - I believe - collateral onboarding submission by TUSD, I think it would be useful to discuss a question that is often brought up: What\u2019s the point of locking up a stablecoin to generate a stablecoin? Why would anyone ever open a CDP backed by TUSD, USDC etc if they have to pay a stability fee and there\u2019s no possibility of the asset going up in value? The answer is that not everyone would want to do this, but there are some who really want it: Market makers and keepers. For market makers, being able to collateralize stablecoins allows for highly flexible and efficient inventory management, and the result is that Dai will become significantly more liquid against any stablecoin that is onboarded as Dai collateral. This is because a market maker will be able to offer large trades at very low spreads, since their capital intensity becomes very low, because stablecoins can have extremely low liquidation ratios. At scale, you can almost think of it as if Dai starts behaving like a fiat backed stablecoin itself, in that it will be so easy to exchange it 1:1 with very low spreads to USD and fiat. Here\u2019s some specific examples: Imagine a USD-backed-stablecoin as Dai collateral that has a liquidation ratio of 100.5%, and imagine a market maker with 1 million of the USD-backed-stablecoin in his inventory. A counterparty then approaches the market maker with 100 million USD, and wants to convert that to Dai. It seems like converting 100 million USD into Dai in one go would be very difficult without significant slippage, but with stablecoins as collateral it now becomes trivial. The market maker simply receives the 100 million USD, converts it into the fiat backed stablecoin, and together with his own 1 million in capital he\u2019s able to instantly generate 100 million Dai and close the trade. Because his only costs are the cost of his 1 million in internal capital, and the stability fees on the stablecoin CDP until his trades balance out in the other direction (which in a very liquid market shouldn\u2019t take long), he can charge a razor thin spread and still make a lot of money because the volumes get so high. Another and more simple use case is for when the price of Dai trades above the peg, like what\u2019s currently the case. To earn some free money, a keeper can take his capital and turn it into a fiat stablecoin 1:1, and then generate Dai, buy more fiat stablecoins (at a rate above 1 USD because Dai is above the peg) and continue the cycle of buying fiat stablecoins with generated Dai. A single keeper would theoretically be able to bring the peg back down by doing this, if the debt ceiling for the fiat stablecoins were high enough. However the strategy does rely on Maker governance continuing to lower DSR and stability fees in this scenario, since otherwise the keeper will be stuck paying the stability fee on non-appreciating fiat stablecoins and could ultimately end up loosing money. However as long as there is a way for keepers to signal that they are this kind of position and will eventually unwind it, it should work well together with governance ensure much greater stability of Dai.

What about a third use case? if the Dai adoption was too high so that we lose the peg to more than 1$ with 0% DSR and we almost run out of safe collaterals. can we use stable coins with a liquidation ratio of 100%  and 0% SF to buy us time until we can scale the protocol instead of Global settlement?     -ve DSR vs centralized stable coins as collaterals!

But it\u2019s important that all collateral types in the system always have an LR of more than 100%, or an SF of more than 0%, since they always introduce some level of risk to the system. (There\u2019s only one exception and that\u2019s for SCD in its specific use as collateral during the SCD -> MCD upgrade) For centralized USD stablecoins I believe the risk parameters can be extremely low. SF could be less than 1%, and LR could be 100.5% or maybe even less. For centralized fiat stablecoins that are different from USD, the risk parameters would have to be a little higher, and probably would have to be similar to the terms offered when doing forex margin trading (100x leverage).

                    "content": "Hi. Agree that giving MMs and Keepers the best tools possible is somewhat paramount to this project. And hence adding stablecoins as collateral would be a great benefit. However I believe that there are at least some in this community (me included) that are worried about (not necessarily against) adding centralized coins as collateral. Would it not be possible to create baskets of centralized coins wrapped in a ERC20 and then use this basket as collateral instead? The purpose would be to alleviate some of the centralization risk. For example if five fiat stablecoins were wrapped in a basket (20% each) with a LR at about 130%. Then theoretically one of the stablecoins could basically collapse (assuming the stablecoins are not correlated) and there should still be more than a 100% in collateral hence no MKR printing when liquidating CDP. The way I see this is that some of the centralization risk is moved from MTH to CDP owners. So instead of MTH deciding on introducing centralization risk we can kind of pass on this decision to CDP owners who would have to consider if opening a CDP with this basket of collateral would be worth the risk or not. I realize that a LR of 130% is very different than 100.5% but maybe this would be a more balanced approach considering the pros and cons of centralized stablecoins as collateral? Assuming I am not missing any details that renders this approach impractical what is peoples opinion on using baskets of centralized coins? ",

As long as the stability fee is set correctly to match the expected loss over time, and the portfolio as a whole is sufficiently diversified, the net effect on MKR will still be deflationary. I know it\u2019s scary to imagine putting your trust in risk models, but being able to do so is the fundamental premise on which not only Maker rests, but society in general due to the role of finance in capitalism. Now if your concern is that you\u2019re worried about Maker imploding in the short run, before it can feasibly reach strong diversification, the thing to keep in mind is that the alternative to expanding the collateral portfolio as much as possible is to keep completely reliant on ETH, which isn\u2019t really any better. Most people in the ecosystem tend to underestimate the inherent risk of ETH because it seems so old and so permanent when counting in blockchain ecosystem time. But the truth is that ETH has a similar and very real risk of sudden total collapse when compared to centralized stablecoins. While the network itself is decentralized, it has significant reliance on just a few centralized exchanges for its market value, most of which - unlike a centralized stablecoin - aren\u2019t regulated or overseen in any manner whatsoever.

Makes sense. I think my counter argument to that would be that isn\u2019t it more difficult to quantify the risk of a centralized coin compared to a more trust less system then? I might be wrong on that though. But still it seems to me like there is a path to somewhat mitigating the risk of trusting centralized collaterals by using a basket? So still not convinced that this is not a path worth taking at least long term (even though it gives less flexibility in regards to setting risk parameters).     rune:  Now if your concern is that you\u2019re worried about Maker imploding in the short run, before it can feasibly reach strong diversification   I am not really considering the short run. Long term however I would be worried about MKR taking a significant hit (because of MKR dilution) in a scenario where a centralized collateral goes to zero. If the LR is set to 100.5% and the collateral goes to zero does it not mean that at least in theory close to 100% of this collateral would need to be covered by MKR dilution? Agree that such a loss could be covered by a correctly set SF long term. But short term this would imo likely be a very volatile event which would be very nice to avoid  Congrats on becoming a dad by the way  ",

But maybe the cause would rather be the government of the centralized stablecoin\u2019s jurisdiction shutting down the stablecoin. Or if a majority of an admin multisig were compromised etc.   Something to keep in mind is that both of the scenarios you are mentioning are unlikely to cause the value of the stablecoin for keepers to go to 0. In both cases the legal claim by legitimate holders of the stablecoin still exists, so as long as the underlying reserves aren\u2019t compromised it should be possible for keepers who can prove that they have legitimately obtained the stablecoin to get legal recourse to their claim on the custodian of the reserves. Even if the reserves are also frozen, eventually the claim should go through if it is legitimate. Only if rule of law or property rights are compromised (which governance can select for when accepting a centralized stablecoin from a given jurisdiction in the first place), or by some other means the underlying assets backing the stablecoin aren\u2019t there, do we end up in a situation where bidding on the collateral would actually be worthless for keepers. As an example of what it looks like when a centralized stablecoin is shut down and how innocent users are treated in such a scenario, I think e-gold is a good case to look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold I think the creative MKR-shorting attack scenarios are more important to consider with legal analysis (from a risk-of-collateral-going-poof perspective), since they deal with completely unknown territory in terms of case law and legal precedent, so it is harder to predict what happens in those kinds of edge cases.

I am a Dai market maker, and I have no interest in borrowing DAI on a CDP funded by USDC or similar tokens because those tokens have extremely high black swan risk. That is, they can be seized because of government action without due process, and then the frozen collateral can destabilize the entire Dai ecosystem. We know that Dai is being incorporated in some SK-SNARK privacy schemes as a wrapped token. I could easily see a legal order from a financial regulatory body deciding to seize all regulated stablecoin Dai collateral \u201cbecause of terrorists\u201d and the entire system collapsing due to this. I believe the path to growth for Dai comes from a higher ETH price, not from accepting dubious, government-compliant collateral bearing \u201cfreeze\u201d methods. I\u2019m much more open to non-stable semi-centralized tokens like wBTC, DGX and the like, because they actually bring additional market types to the table. Given the fungibility of stablecoins and extreme ease of exchanging one for another, trading a slight increase in Dai liquidity for a large dallop of systemic risk seems a bad deal. Put me down as a hard \u201cno\u201d on this idea. ",

                    "content": "Hi IslandHunting and welcome to the discussion, With regards to growing the DAI ecosystem there have historically largely been two major strategies, with the difference between the two being how the DAI system should interact with the existing financial system. Call them \u201ccrypto-only\u201d and \u201clove-KYC\u201d or anything else you want. With the \u201ccrypto-only\u201d strategy collateral is exclusively sourced from other crypto assets, making the system lighter in terms of governance and more resiliant against attack. The downside is less collateral, fewer types of collateral and a more niche profile for DAI. The system interacts only weakly with existing financial systems as all funds first pass through other crypto. In the \u201clove-KYC\u201d strategy collateral is additionally sourced from fiat stablecoins and any security token we can lay our hands on. The upside is a huge increase in collateral and a much larger role for DAI, at the expense of more complicated governance and more risks connected with all the new collateral. Additionally the new types of collateral will increasingly make for tougher KYC requirements which is hugely unpopular in some crypto circles. Right now we are more or less headed in the \u201clove-KYC\u201d direction unless external events force a change. It is however very valuable to have participants with opposing views so please continue sharing your doubts. ",

Maybe I\u2019m missing a big piece of the puzzle here, but it seems to me that if MakerDAO starts accepting TUSD, USDC, etc as collateral, then any one of those companies facing legal problems, regulatory issues, or even worse - collapsing - could wreak havoc on the DAI system as well as the value of MKR. I understand the desire to make DAI more liquid as @rune outlined above, but this \u201clove-KYC\u201d idea certainly does not seem like the right path for providing a frictionless alternative to traditional finance, which is what I thought MakerDAO was all about and why I\u2019ve been so attracted to it.

And as such not dependent on any one of these. Actually having only crypto as collateral is currently somewhat centralized as all crypto correlate more or less. Also as long as Dai and hopefully also MKR and some collateral types stays non KYC I think that is good enough imo. All that being said I share your concern to some degree. Which is why I raised the subject of putting centralized collateral types into baskets to mitigate the centralization risks even further. Anyways hope I provided at least a tiny piece to your entire puzzle. And that you stick around and keep making those awesome videos  ",

Then the government has suspended the rule of law by seizing property that legally belongs to the token holders (if I understand correctly, for TUSD the USD reserve belongs to the token holders and is held by a third party). It\u2019s always possible, but the likelihood seems small that a first-world government would do this. The government can\u2019t seize this collateral without screwing over their own citizens who own the token. Most everyone is reliant of the continued good faith of their government and the maintenance of the rule of law. It isn\u2019t something most governments are eager to screw around with because it ultimately leads to civil unrest as their citizens start to feel that the law doesn\u2019t protect them (or their property) from their government.

Even if it\u2019s unlikely to occur, the risk level will no longer be zero, and that\u2019s a big deal. The idea of introducing debt ceilings for each centralized coin (max % of total collateral pool) could be a good way to mitigate this risk. However I\u2019d suggest that those ceilings should be agreed to at the same time or before approving the assets as collateral - not after they\u2019re already approved. My \u201cYes\u201d vote would be contingent upon satisfactory ceilings being agreed upon. I\u2019d be very interested in seeing data simulations proving that the ceilings will be low enough to mitigate the effects of any centralized disasters in terms of both DAI peg and MKR value. ",

However in a hypothetical world where I\u2019m looking for maximum safety and I have the choice between a pure dollar-denominated ETH debt instrument and a mixed debt with assets under the power of several countries + crypto collateral, all in reasonable proportions, I will choose the mixed instrument. That seems pretty obvious. It also seems pretty obvious that the \u201creasonable proportions\u201d part is crucial, as mentioned by @Planet_X. If MKR holders disregard safety (i.e.: act against their self-interest), they could give too much influence to an entity with control over a large part of the total collateral. But that\u2019s just one risk among many, and in the long run choosing to have 100% exposure to a single risk (including the current, pure ETH risk situation) is also less safe than the alternative.

Even if it\u2019s unlikely to occur, the risk level will no longer be zero, and that\u2019s a big deal.   The risk will no longer be zero, it\u2019s not right to say that\u2019s necessarily a big deal. If the risk is much greater than zero, then yes, big deal. If the risk is infinitesimal, then no, it\u2019s not a big deal. The chance of my guessing a private ethereum key is non-zero, but that\u2019s not a big deal. It depends on the chance of seizure/shenanigans happening, which is admittedly difficult to judge.     ChrisBlec:  The idea of introducing debt ceilings for each centralized coin (max % of total collateral pool) could be a good way to mitigate this risk. However I\u2019d suggest that those ceilings should be agreed to at the same time or before approving the assets as collateral - not after they\u2019re already approved.   My understanding is that this is how such options will be presented: A collateral package that includes a debt ceiling, a liquidation ratio, and a risk premium.     swakya:  One of the features of Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. is precisely to reduce reliance on the continued good faith of a government, and in general saying \u201cwe\u2019re somewhat reliant on them anyway\u201d shouldn\u2019t justify increasing our reliance.   I would argue this doesn\u2019t appreciably increase our reliance. Any government can make cryptocurrency illegal and strangle crypto to fiat transactions in their jurisdiction. If the U.S does this, many other governments will follow and it will effectively destroy crypto. The risk has always been there even though everyone likes to pretend it isn\u2019t.

Pretty much agree with this, we\u2019re probably a little early to be discussing this in such detail. It\u2019s also worth noting (as David said) that we may be able to effect how early or late this risk analysis happens by voting on the Asset Priority List.

So why would anyone be ever encouraged to open a CDP with any crypto currency? In my opinion it is only suitable for leveraging one\u2019s speculation on a rising value of a currency. Of course there will always be people who search for the risk, but should this be the foundation of a stable coin?     rune:  Imagine a USD-backed-stablecoin as Dai collateral that has a liquidation ratio of 100.5%, and imagine a market maker with 1 million of the USD-backed-stablecoin in his inventory. A counterparty then approaches the market maker with 100 million USD, and wants to convert that to Dai. It seems like converting 100 million USD into Dai in one go would be very difficult without significant slippage, but with stablecoins as collateral it now becomes trivial. The market maker simply receives the 100 million USD, converts it into the fiat backed stablecoin, and together with his own 1 million in capital he\u2019s able to instantly generate 100 million Dai and close the trade. Because his only costs are the cost of his 1 million in internal capital, and the stability fees on the stablecoin CDP until his trades balance out in the other direction (which in a very liquid market shouldn\u2019t take long), he can charge a razor thin spread and still make a lot of money because the volumes get so high.   I don\u2019t really get why anyone should put that much trust in it and make a huge amount of DAI- debt?     rune:  Another and more simple use case is for when the price of Dai trades above the peg, like what\u2019s currently the case. To earn some free money, a keeper can take his capital and turn it into a fiat stablecoin 1:1, and then generate Dai, buy more fiat stablecoins (at a rate above 1 USD because Dai is above the peg) and continue the cycle of buying fiat stablecoins with generated Dai. A single keeper would theoretically be able to bring the peg back down by doing this, if the debt ceiling for the fiat stablecoins were high enough. However the strategy does rely on Maker governance continuing to lower DSR and stability fees in this scenario, since otherwise the keeper will be stuck paying the stability fee on non-appreciating fiat stablecoins and could ultimately end up loosing money. However as long as there is a way for keepers to signal that they are this kind of position and will eventually unwind it, it should work well together with governance ensure much greater stability of Dai.   This actually sounds like a huge Ponzi scheme and a good governance could never allow something like that. Today we are in the \u201cCorona Crisis\u201d and as I\u2019ve read, many assets had to be liquified, in order to hold the stability of the coin. This is not really suprising for me. If you speculate and you are wrong, you simply lose assets and that\u2019s the thing people have to be aware of, if they open a CDP. But CDP\u2019s are the only way, to create the stable coin. That\u2019s why this process is essential for the system, right? The only thing which could make it interesting for a investor, would be a high savings rate. If I look at the risk, and compare it with a debt crisis of a nation, the savings rate would have to be above 20% to make it interesting for an investor. And even then I\u2019d simply wait for someone else to make debt, and sell me his DAI. So he would be in debt and take the risk of liquidation. I would be without debt on the other hand and simply take the interest rate. So why should I ever open a CDP? I\u2019d really appreciate, if you or anyone else could help me out with my questions. Thank you in advance. ",

Another use of a CDP will be to just get dollars you want to spend without selling your crypto. Here the interest rate is again very competitive. A similar service from a centralized company like Nexo (which are growing like crazy, btw) will give you an interest rate of over 5% and collaterization requirement of 200%+. ",

Providing liquidity for market making Arbitraging the peg  For 1 (liquidity) the PSM is a much better approach (small fee to put fiat-backed currency in, none to get it out, see here PSM Governance Timeline ). Having a vault is a risk, I don\u2019t see why the inventory would be kept. I\u2019m amazed how the arbitrage is good on Uniswap so liquidity is there. Still the debt doesn\u2019t move much on the downside. For 2, raising USDC from 40M to 80M didn\u2019t help much. It seems that no one is in the mood to arbitrage the peg. As the peg is an ongoing issue and we haven\u2019t been able to solve it, it\u2019s far from a riskless arbitrage as the carry is high. You can arb if you expect steps being taken in weeks, it is not the case here. In any case, we seem to be yearlight from LR of 100% (or 100.5%) and 0% (or 0.5%) SF (see Signal Request: Lower the USDC-A Liquidation Ratio and Risk Premium ) and both 1 and 2 need that. 1 is arbitraging the peg before it deviate and 2 is arbitrage it after. I dig a bit to see what USDC is used for. I used http://makervaults.descipher.io/ for that. Main accounts using those vaults are 0xf7bCD7bB00f4D081775FedEF64e92017a10d4b25 and 0xa4214cab2b92900F82a32Ee881D15a8809F764ee. Together they represent 80% of the pool. They both started with USDC, made a vault to get DAI then leveraged that up in Compound to farm. Together they represent 10% of the amount of DAI on Compound (around 125M thanks to leverage). We can argue that they provide a bit of liquidity to compound as they borrow only 73% they bring while 86% of DAI in compound are lend, but \u2026 that\u2019s not much. We can expect that when the farming season ends, they will revert back to USDC. DAI creation, DAI destruction => balance empty (in fact, they will have to buy on the market to pay interest). No conversion risk, we custody their USDC. They don\u2019t care about the price of DAI, they will not arb it. The PSM is different as there is no promise to get USDC back at the same rate. This is still anecdotal evidence but I don\u2019t see the use of stablecoin vault to help the peg in normal markets. ",

                    "content": "@SebVentures More DAI liquidity on compound is still decent. People can arbitrage the peg from there. Also, with the new compound DAI interest formula, they\u2019re going to be demanding more DAI liquidity until they can get utilization down to 80%.     SebVentures:  This is still anecdotal evidence but I don\u2019t see the use of stablecoin vault to help the peg in normal markets.   I do agree that the stablecoin vault isn\u2019t the best in normal markets. We might just see a lot of rate arbitrage. Which is why I think we always want to keep a healthy risk premium on USDC, so we can at least profit off of people doing rate arbitrage. This is why we can\u2019t have a 0% SF, and we can\u2019t have a very low LR without a buffer for stability fees. Another thing to note is that in normal markets, we don\u2019t need the PSM to help do DAI market making in normal markets. Curve will offer a ton of bid and ask liquidity for DAI then. ",

The rapid fall in the price of ETH can easily trigger a black swan event (for example: 3.12 event). (2) Stable coins are assets with stable prices. Stablecoins may be locked due to legal issues. Let us compare the probabilities of the two, and then we can know the correct answer. I choose to support @rune. Because assets like ETH often have high price fluctuations, I will relatively choose stable currencies (not easy to produce black swan events). ",

                    "content": "I agree that stablecoins are great as collateral from a MarkerDAO perspective. There is only a protocol risk. Assuming a risk premium and enough collateral diversification with uncorrelated risk, that easy to manage. From a customer point of view, there is no interest in using $1.1 as collateral to borrow $1 with a 4% interest rate. The rational way is to swap.There is now enough liquidity. Sure on a 20M amount, they will have to pay slippage, they will destroy the peg for a short amount of time, but that\u2019s how you create a market maker ecosystem. As a framework, the collateral should be more valuable that the borrowing asset. We can expect PAXG, WBTC or even ETH to be inflation protected while USD (therefore DAI) is not. It makes sense to borrow DAI against such collateral at least until the SF is above inflation or the risk free rate (whatever that means here). @rune proposed cDAI, I\u2019m all to study that (with aDAI, cUSDC, \u2026), I would add uniswap liquidity pools as well. That the kind of collateral that makes sense (more valuable than a DAI). It would also allow to influence interest rates on compound, aave and solve liquidity issues. I agree that with USDC facility at 4% we should see DAI supply rate at maximum around USDC borrow rate +4%. That\u2019s not far from that at the moment in Compound. Okay, but the problem is more why there is such a difference. Look at the supply rate between stablecoins. That\u2019s not normal if it stays that way. The market is telling something. ",
