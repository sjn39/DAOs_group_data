That way a user can see that a decentralized ID is part of a collection with other IDs for example, and they can click through to the collection to find other projects they might be interested in. Basically, make collections discoverable from grants as much as grants are discoverable from collections. It would also be nice if projects could self-organize by adding tags to categorize themselves. Then users could click on the tags to see what other projects had put themselves in the same category, or find similar projects by putting tags in the search bar. ",

                    "content": "Looking from the user perspective I believe that Gitcoin offers plenty of ways for them to search, filter, and find the grants they want to fund. I agree that a lot of times great grants get buried down the list but whatever we do to bring them up we are the ones enforcing that, thus making other grants come into their place (there\u2019s always gonna be someone at the bottom). This is a usability and UX research topic and something that need to be worked on deeply understanding existing user profiles and their interactions on the site in order to provide simple solutions targeting their specific needs and solving the bigger problem. Personally, I just take an hour or two and simply go throug  e v e r y   s i n g l e    g r a n t  and decide which ones to add to cart. But my path, intentions and motivations are not the same as to others. Therefore, I suggest doing more research and tracking site metrics, looking for dropoffs, and finding ways maybe through browsing the site to encourage further discovery (suggestions, similar grants, people who viewed also viewed etc. / just thinking out loud). I didn\u2019t offer an explicit solution but hope this helped a bit. ",

Even if people do see and use them they might not know what is best and they\u2019ll probably try different ones at random. The collections are also a great idea, but one of the downsides to them is that if I for example have a grant I\u2019m basically begging the popular folks to include my grant in their collection. You\u2019ll be highly dependent on your existing social networking skills, and as a developer that is not to great at pitching himself it\u2019s extremely difficult to get a proper footing. This is also why I started out with Grandiose, where my goal is to make finding grants fun without relying too much on social networking skills or possible biased algorithms. Instead, I\u2019d prefer to explore grants while doing fun little games that don\u2019t rely on different ordering or networking. I\u2019m currently taking a small break playing World of Warcraft, and this game also makes the most mundane and borings tasks fun. With Grandiose I aim to do the same, by making exploration fun and non-biased without the user having to think about anything at all. I\u2019ve started out with a Tinder like system of swiping and aim to re-implement collections as I think there\u2019s much more to them than simply being shared with others. Other things we could try to \u2018gamify\u2019 exploration is by introducing mini-games such as memory or other games that allow grants the opportunity to be seen without some kind of ranking or sorting algorithm. Another venture would be multiplayer kind of games with leaderboards, but we\u2019ll have to be wary that it doesn\u2019t simply become a popularity contest again but with extra steps. ",
