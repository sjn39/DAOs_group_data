Welcome to episode #11 of Focus On. I am Retro from the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit. Today, I am excited to be joined by New Silver to give an update both on the housing market and a quick recap of the past year of New Silver serving as the first RWA onboarded by MakerDAO. April 21st, 2021, was the first Dai minted on-chain backed by RWA by New Silver. We will discuss the macro and micro-economic trends affecting the U.S. real estate markets and some strategies about how they plan to navigate the environment. For other episodes of FO, please check the forum.

Is that time frame 12 months out that you are seeing, or would it be longer? 28:06 - Teej: Regarding credit scoring, in terms of this line in the sand between \u201cborrowers with experience and without,\u201d what is the science behind that? 33:36 - Teej: How do you think about when you underwrite what weights you are giving to LTC versus LTV as we shift into a new rising rate environment? 37:01 - Retro: Loans are typically about 12 months, and we are about at that 12-month period since your first onboarding. How are you seeing borrowers re-engaging with your team? Are you starting to build a client base that is consistently coming back? 40:22 - Retro: Is the surplus buffer going to be driven by new customer attraction and new market segments, or is it more of this repeat business that you feel? 42:28 - Teej: In terms of the New Silver product, is the intention to originate fixed or floating or both? Is the intention to stick within the single-family RESI wheelhouse or widen the aperture? 46:06 - Teej: Another nice feature of single-family stabilized is there is a large marginal buyer in the market in Blackstone and the Ilk. They will buy these things up in the thousands. 49:20 - Retro: What is the best way for the MakerDAO community to reach out and engage with the team?  Closing Comment  Retro  Outro 50:19  Thanks, everybody, for joining today. We will see you in the forums.   Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary.  @gala produced this summary.
