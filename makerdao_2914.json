                    "content": "Preamble MIP13c3-SP#: 8 Author(s): Hugh Karp (@hughkarp) Contributors: n/a Status: Request for Comment (RFC) Date Proposed: 2020-11-09 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd> Declaration Statement: Maker Governance wishes to engage Nexus Mutual to provide cover for the Maker Protocol. Declaration to Replace: n/a  Specification Context and Motivation  The Maker Protocol burns MKR in good times when surplus is being generated and mints MKR in bad times when debt is accrued. As was demonstrated on Black Thursday this tends to result in MKR being burned at high prices and minted at low prices. It can be beneficial to purchase cover on Nexus Mutual that provides DAI when bad debt accrues to dampen MKR minting, with the cover purchase being paid for using high MKR prices. Recognizing this procyclical nature of MKR minting and burning, MakerDAO wishes to purchase tailored cover on Nexus Mutual to provide DAI claims when material bad debt is accrued by the protocol. Over cycles this is expected to result in a lower MKR supply. MakerDAO may also benefit from more material tail risk coverage in the future which can be worked towards as Nexus Mutual grows as it would be a relatively easy extension of the proposed solution.  The following is declared: Declaration Detail   Provided pricing is at or below 4% pa (to be discussed in RFC stage), MakerDAO wishes to purchase four (4) tranches of Maker Protocol Cover of 3,000,000 DAI per tranche for a period of 365 days (up to 12,000,000 DAI total) on the basis of the following claims payment terms:  If the Maker Protocol accrues bad debt of more than 5,000,000 DAI in any 30 day period, one tranche of 3,000,000 DAI claim will be paid; and If the Maker Protocol accrues bad debt of more than 10,000,000 DAI in any 30 day period an additional tranche of 3,000,000 DAI claim will be paid; and If the Maker Protocol accrues bad debt of more than 15,000,000 DAI in any 30 day period an additional tranche of 3,000,000 DAI claim will be paid, and If the Maker Protocol accrues bad debt of more than 20,000,000 DAI in any 30 day period an additional trance of 3,000,000 DAI claim will be paid, up to a maximum of four (4) tranches and a total claim payment of 12,000,000 DAI. Maker Protocol bad debt definition to be defined in detail through discussions with the working group (see below), so that a) it is simple to determine if a claim should be paid; and b) can\u2019t arbitrarily be triggered by MKR holders; and c) doesn\u2019t weaken MKR holders incentives to build surplus.    Note: the above is a suggested framework and can be altered through discussion with working group.   The MakerDAO community, wishes to enact a working group titled \u201cMaker Protocol Cover Group\u201d led by TBA to:  Review the claims wording before it is launched on Nexus Mutual to start the price discovery process, in particular the specific definition of bad debt and how it can be measured in the Maker Protocol; and Review if any changes should be made to the Maker Protocol to ensure flop auctions can be avoided via direct claim payment into the protocol; and Determine the best way for MakerDAO to technically interact with Nexus Mutual\u2019s smart contracts including;     a) the cover purchase process;  b) payments made from the Maker Protocol; and     c) submission of claims. Review the pricing threshold and claims payout structure outlined in the declaration detail and make changes if considered appropriate.

My one comment would be that we should find an alternative measurement to \u201cbad debt.\u201d I say this to protect Nexus, not MakerDAO. If the MKR holders wanted, they could mechanically trigger these contracts by collecting fees beyond 100% collateralization (by turning off liquidations) and using this Dai to buy MKR. This would technically be \u201cbad debt\u201d but the MKR holders in reality would be double-dipping. I would defer to the working group to see the best specific language for the coverage, but I think what you\u2019ve presented so far is more than enough to move forward. ",

How I read the provision above: If MakerDAO allows a 4 million DAI surplus buffer to accumulate, then would need to incur 9 million DAI liquidaiton shortfall to trigger first tranche coverage. If MakerDAO allows only a 1 million DAI surplus buffer to accumulate, then need to incur a 6 million DAI liquidation shortfall to trigger it. Do I understand that correctly? If so, doesn\u2019t that create a (perverse) incentive to not hold a surplus buffer? In my view, \u201cbad debt\u201d is the shortfall when a specific vault is liquidated but the amount recovered after disposing of the collateral is less than the outstanding debt.  The sum of all such vaults is the total bad debt. Why should the surplus buffer matter any more than how much money you have in the bank matters when you get an insurance payout for your house burning down? ",

I think it\u2019s widely agree that the coverage would have a negative expected value to MakerDAO (based strictly on the premium vs. expected payout). The main proposed benefit to MakerDAO is avoiding the need to auction of MKR during a time of depressed MKR prices (which seems likely to be correlated with bad debt, such as during the March 2020 crash). Some things to consider:   There are other ways to avoid large Flop auctions during a time of crisis, such as:  Increasing the Debt Buffer (how much debt is allowed before Flop auctions start) Limiting how much MKR can be out for auction at a time by adding  the same Litter/Box functionality recently added to collateral auctions    B. Protocol has reduced the chances and amount of any potential bad debt. If MakerDAO wanted to spend some Dai to reduce the chances of bad debt further, it could grant some Dai to the rewards pool to further incentivize vault holders to move over.  Even 5% of the proposed cost of this proposal would probably go a long way.   This kind of coverage is highly gameable because interested parties can easily ensure they never need to make a payout. All they need to do is run some auction keeper bots. In fact, anyone potentially on the line to pay out millions of DAI if bad debt accrues would be irresponsible if they did not do so (remember, it was only the lack of sufficient well-functioning keepers that caused the losses of March 2020). This may be a valuable behavior to incentivize, but B. Protocol incentivizes behavior with similar results but no payments from MakerDAO.   If MakerDAO is mismanaged, and despite all points above the system incurs large amounts of bad Debt, is it really undesirable to conduct auctions of MKR at the prevailing market price? Doing so would dilute the voting power of MKR which badly managed the system and give newly minted MKR a chance to do a better job.  It could be that\u2019s actually beneficial in the long run.  In other words, this coverage could be a moral hazard.   This is a proposal to charge MakerDAO a premium of hundreds of thousands of DAI, per year. Unless there\u2019s a lot I\u2019m missing here, this seems extremely expensive what what MakerDAO gets. ",

Insurance is great when you want to outsource the risk management. But MakerDAO is directly managing its risk profile (Risk Teams), it is setting up the min. coll. ratios to handle it, and corresponding SF. All in all, I feel like MakerDAO should handle the risk internally (as it was always designed to do) and do it well. One notable exception are stablecoins: we might want to insure ourself against the crash in value of any of the stablecoins we use. This is because it would be very unlikely that we can handle such situation with the tools at our disposal (margin calls and auction mechanisms) since the coll. ratio is 101%. But hopefully we will reduce our exposure to stablecoins in the future. ",

Also, I think incentivising extra keeper bots can only be a good thing for the Maker Protocol. On the moral hazard point, I think this is a genuine concern and is why I suggested a maximum 60% payout. It provides significant dampening but maintains alignment of interest. From my experience if you start getting close to 80% there can be problems. Of course there is a question on value for money, and that will always be hard to answer, as we\u2019re talking about extreme risk. While the EV in DAI terms over cycles should be negative, if large claims occur early and prices subsequently rise then Maker can choose not to renew. Expectations always differ from actual results when dealing with risk transfer. ",

I want to echo some sentiments.     iammeeoh:      Spidomo:  Unless there\u2019s a lot I\u2019m missing here, this seems extremely expensive what what MakerDAO gets.   I generally agree with your point of view   Let me add a few points.  Excuse me if I may not get the number accurately here but I am roughing it here.   I see 3M on every 5M lost on top of the 4M or so banked.  So we are looking at maximum of 12M coverage on 27M(40% coverage) loss (4M of which is already covered by surplus).   Maker takes a 12M Nexus covers 3M (25%), 17M, 6M(33%) etc.   so even if this was bonded to the full 12M (which it won\u2019t be) the money earns 4% which isn\u2019t bad in the current near zero rate environemnt. Honestly have to wonder what scenarios this is going to mitigate losses.   I mean if we are looking at catastrophic events it literally is like 10M or 200M here with a DAI outstanding of almost $1B.   The idea that somehow a 12-25M loss could be targetted with this kind of insurance on a potential 1B outstanding seems ill thought out here.  When I resolve risk in this case there aren\u2019t many circumstances where this isn\u2019t an all or nothing insurance. Once we got to 1B and had some reasonable fees 2-4% ( skip the debate on USDC-A here on surplus) the protocol is earning 20-40M/yr and a 10M hit while distasteful is something the protocol \u2018should\u2019 be able to handle via fees and risk management. (imo).  Do we really want to give someone else .5M/yr for a up to 12M insurance policy? Then a thought came to mind that led to the following questions for Nexus Mutual here:  Does Nexus Mutual own MKR currently? If yes to 1 - does it vote that MKR? If no to 1 - does it intend to buy MKR if this insurance is accepted? or voluntarily declare not to buy MKR to avoid any possible governance conflicts of interst while insurance contracts are active?  My problem here is that someone could literally take 5-10M now and buy MKR and vote to affect Maker actions to reduce the risk here and guarantee profit (as well as added extensions/increases in price etc. potentially).  Which if you think about it is a good incentive one might even want to require of such an insurer (that they place their money where their mouth is on insurance by owning AND voting the MKR).   But this could also become a double edged sword an insurer with vested interest in Maker not wanting Maker to take on risk to grow\u2026 So before I would vote to accept an insurance contract I want to know up front whether our insurer has a stake in MKR, plans to obtain some conditionally on insurance being accepted, or whether they fully intend to avoid any conflict of interest here by not owning MKR so I could have full disclosure at least on intentions. Generally I think Maker should take a more global look at this issue, characterize risk events and whether we should even try to offload pieces of the risk profile on to other players. Other questions.   Where does this player expect to source DAI during such events? What is the time frame for calling on insurance and delivery of DAI funds?  Minutes, hours or days? End result of this is unless I have missed some other more lengthly forum thread/discussion avenue I think a more general risk and risk mitigation discussion should be had within MakerDAO, with some polling on this generally.   Where do Maker risk teams sit on this. ",

                    "content": "@g_dip I presume it\u2019s relatively easy to measure any protocol losses that occur that would reduce the buffer, if so we can use that as the trigger instead. eg if losses > $xm within a month then trigger a claim payout. You can also get more complicated if required, eg by linking the claim payout to some combination of strategic reserves and losses incurred. This would allow you to calibrate to the right level of self insurance vs reinsurance. @ejbarraza your structure makes sense to me. One point, cover with Nexus is probably more valuable to Maker when you haven\u2019t built up any strategic reserves yet, as this is when you are more exposed. It may make sense to implement cover first and then build up strategic reserves rather than the other way around. ",

                    "content": "@Hugh_Karp The reason I suggest building a strategic reserve first is that having the funds in place means Maker DAO can move quickly to stabilize the system if necessary. If we opt for buying Nexus cover without first having reserves, then we are at the mercy of the claims payout timeline. I presume that it will not be immediate which in DeFi can lead to catastrophic losses (e.g. Black Thursday). How long do you think it would take from a legitimate claim being filed to the point of Maker DAO being compensated? ",

I believe this fits within the current flop auction time window (but I\u2019m not 100% on that). This would be a technical detail to pick up in the working group. The goal would be to get the claim payment in before the auctions start. re reserves, my only point was you still have to build reserves up whether you have Nexus cover or not, and building them up will take time. Nexus cover can help bridge that gap. ",

With some of the recent Declarations of Intent we\u2019ve found that having the contents be highly specific has caused frustration on all sides when it comes to implementation. Generally, with something like this the domain teams may want to provide feedback and analysis regarding the numbers and mechanics involved. Given their current workload the domain teams aren\u2019t going to have time to look at something until it\u2019s passed a governance vote. However, it is possible that they will feel obligated to recommend changes to the proposed numbers / mechanics after the Declaration of Intent vote takes place. This can cause problems if governance or the author of the subproposal thought they were voting for specific numbers / mechanisms that were already set in stone. I think this process will move more smoothly if the Declaration is more general. This also helps capture support from those that agree in principle, but disagree with the specifics. I would maybe clarify in the wording that the pricing and / or tranches is a starting point, and is subject to change pending recommendations from the working group and / or relevant domain teams. I\u2019d also like to clarify that the domain teams aren\u2019t obligated to work on implementation or analysis of this declaration if it does pass through governance. ",
