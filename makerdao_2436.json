Note that ETH has not has any other hard forks to recover funds since then, e.g. the Parity multisig issue. ETC on the other hand has had a well publicized 51% attack, and many exchanges require 1000+ confirmations before crediting ETC deposits. For now, ETH is far and away the most reliable base layer.

                    "content": "You\u2019re making it sound like the reversal on the DAO hack was this horrible thing. Most people disagree. Those funds were hacked, aka stolen, and the hard fork returned funds to their rightful owners. Also keep in mind the transactions were not actually reversed, they were hard forked. A hacker can\u2019t come in and reverse transactions, at least without a 51% attack. Someone could hard fork Ethereum and try to make it more popular than than the original\u2026 but uhhh\u2026 good luck! Unless the community agrees with you by nearly consensus, the new fork will not go anywhere. So there\u2019s no security issue here based on the DAO forking. ETH is much more secure than ETC. At the core of your questions though is a legitimate philosophical discussion: whether it is better to have an immutable ledger that accepts catastrophic errors as the responsibility of individuals and the community at large because \u201ccode is law\u201d, or that blockchains should be symbiotic democratic systems between code and people and a situation we all agree is bad should be able to be fixed in a democratic way. Personally I find the second option of people able to use all tools we have available, including hard fork when bad things happen, the most robust way for blockchains to grow and function. Code errors happen inevitably, humans are fickle. If code is faulty it will produce poor results and sometimes it makes sense for that to be fixed. The fact that code issues can be fixed retroactively with public blockchains is a feature, not a bug. ",
