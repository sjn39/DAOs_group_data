Nevertheless, this is a complex undertaking, with a new asset class (13 pages of risk assessment), huge contractual documentation (100 pages), 2 technical MIPS (MIP21, MIP22) that took 9 months since the MIP6 application. Therefore, I want to share the presentation early and be happy to discuss any point you need more clarity on. This will help to improve the presentation and the following documentation.   docs.google.com    New Silver Onboarding - GR Meeting Presentation MakerDAO New Silver Onboarding MIP22 April, 8th 2021      ",
