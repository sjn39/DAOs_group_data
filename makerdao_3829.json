                    "content": "Greetings from the Content Production Core Unit! Previous updates have focused on our actual content production but some comments were made on our last update about the team\u2019s output so we\u2019re switching up the format to try and be more transparent about all of the work we\u2019ve been doing to get the team up and running.  Administrative Updates The topic of legal protection has recently been raised (here and here) so I want to address the fact that we\u2019ve formed an LLC to protect contributors from personal liability. We\u2019ve put a lot of effort into understanding what it takes to accommodate candidates who prefer to enjoy the perks of traditional employment rather than a higher pay rate (healthcare/insurance, w2 instead of 1099, 401k, etc.).  Set up accounting Set up a business bank account Created job ads and conducted interviews for three positions Hired and started onboarding one writer and one video producer Made an offer to a social media/community manager   Content Production We\u2019ve created a dashboard to track the Requests for Comment we\u2019ve received from the community. Please note this is not an exhaustive list of the content the team is producing; just the work we\u2019re collaborating on with other Core Units.  Met with dTalent (being incubated by SES) to support the development of a Talent Portal. Published video, audio, and a transcription of the AMA with William Remor of Real-World Finance Hosted a discussion on marketing and product development  Transcribed What the World is Doing With Dai Featuring CurioInvest Met with SES to discuss needs around the Community Portal Published Maker Relay Ep 49 and Ep 50  Started planning updates to the Community Portal   Looking Ahead In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll be:  Announcing details of the Mascot Logo Contest to decide between the Capybara and Dragon for MakerDAO\u2019s mascot Continuing work on the Community Portal Starting to work on the production of educational videos Hosting an AMA on Centrifuge and Tinlake With Lea, Lucas, and Martin Strategizing with GovComms to expand the scope of Maker Relay And more!  As always, check out our Transparency Dashboard 13 to see what we\u2019re working on and please join us for our weekly Office Hours on Tuesdays at 14:30 UTC. ",
