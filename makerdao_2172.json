Paragraph Summary This subproposal onboards Prototech Labs LLC as a Facilitator for the Protocol Engineering (PECU-001) Core Unit. The Prototech Labs business entity will be represented on the forum as @Prototech_Labs , with official communications also coming from its representative, @Derek.  Specification  Motivation The motivation for bringing about this update is to have a professional business entity and business relationship for all activities. PECU work will continue as per the team mandate and will be conducted by Prototech Labs as experts in blockchain research & development. This formality also helps to move the team forward in terms of branding and alignment with the Endgame as PECU prepares for new scope discussions as an independent entity. If the MIP4c2-SP34 in RFC passes on which this MIP is based, and if this MIP passes, the facilitation of the PECU-Core-Unit will be handed over to Prototech Labs LLC and its representative, @Derek. If MIP4c2-SP34 does not pass, there will be an open position for PECU facilitation after a three-month handover period.  Details  The existing PECU multisig and stream will continue to operate and will come under the new ownership of Prototech Labs. To avoid any doubt, Prototech Labs does not and will not participate in any governance polling or voting. As such, approval of a vote to onboard Prototech Labs will constitute acceptance of our terms of service and our business relationship with MakerDAO.   Contacts: Core Unit ID Name - Protocol Engineering ID - PECU-001 Facilitator name and information Name - Derek, on behalf of Prototech Labs Forum - @Derek on behalf of @Prototech_Labs Discord - Derek_#5520 on behalf of Prototech Labs ",

If MIP4c2-SP34 passes, then this proposal onboards Prototech Labs as Facilitator of the Protocol Engineering Core Unit (PECU). Prototech Labs will be represented by @Derek. If MIP4c2-SP34 fails, then there will be an open position for PECU facilitation after a three-month handover period. This MIP is intended to pass in conjunction with MIP41c5-SP15 which offboards the current facilitator. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.
