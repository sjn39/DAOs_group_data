With a broader approved scope, 6s Capital can then focus on growing its lending operations within that scope, raising the needed institutional equity, running the operations, being in compliance with the Credit Agreements, and engaging with governance. Crawl. Walk. Run. - Part 1. Part 2. Part 3. Part 4. With MIP72, it is 6s\u2019 hope that other participants engage with the DAO and follow the path that 6s has set forth to also be a non-bank operating commercial lender. We need more LendCOs. What does an \u201cArranger\u201d do? In summary, an arranger is a DAO-empowered role that causes real-world commerce while doing so with \u201cchecks and balances\u201d based on a framework and scope / authorization approved by the DAO. Further, this role is one that should \u201crise-above\u201d the legal nuances (leaving those for licensed experts) and focus on core implementation, construct deals, and cause commerce.  General Context, Motivation, and Background: The DAO is composed of various members spanning the globe, each with a unique skill set and contribution to Maker. While the DAO is relatively young, it has grown to now utilize external collateral as well as digital collateral. Such collateral must be properly attached (in both digital and \u201creal-world\u201d forms). Attached in this context means a construct that would allow for a senior lien foreclosure in a court of law. To protect itself, the DAO must approach attaching various forms of collateral with humility and always yield to trusted external experts that have industry experience in securing said collateral.  Certainty Lenders (all of them) revolve on certainty. The business of a lender is lending money to others. The first responsibility of a lender is to know they have a source of money to lend. Before even allocating the resources to start engaging with would-be borrowers (regardless of scope), they rely / thrive / require certainty they can execute, while operating within certain boundaries. Reputation and ability to \u201cdo what you say\u201d is paramount, as well as contractual obligations to do so. Once onboarded, engaging with the DAO must not gate transaction capability.  Monolithic vs Modular There are various implementation techniques to allow for attaching collateral in the real-world (especially evolving to new collateral).  Monolithic Structure On first pass, the inclination is to just amend the existing Credit Agreement over and over. In this context we would have the world\u2019s most extensive and broad credit agreement (and associated security agreement) to encompass a known scope without knowing how to properly attach each underlying collateral. When a borrower agrees to a blanket lien, it is paramount to be able to secure all associated collateral. It is illogical to assume we will know before we engage with a would-be borrower each type of collateral and have received governance approval for the legal language to attach each type. Each collateral type would have to be described and referenced in a document that would be in a state of being \u201cever-amended\u201d (with each amendment needing governance to approve). While conceptually possible, the notion of a monolithic solution is referenced to contrast why a modular strategy is superior in every conceivable way.  Modular Structure By utilizing a Delaware Series LLC (aka a segregated portfolio company in other jurisdictions), an unlimited number of registered Series each legally isolated from the other may be created. Each series would have its own equity and its own debt. Thus each Series within the LendCo would then have its own Credit Agreement tailored to the specific type of collateral to be attached or even more broadly per project. In addition or alternatively, a wholly owned newly formed Delaware LLC may be substutied for a new Series as the case may be.  0UzDldt9u1ujx7s2J4RQHYqlZXGixDhSMQG3oMFLgxeFidrwJLjq5mArD4zNpkrZeXxrx9zoaZI2m35vF1YmvGSdHB8-RJpDNXlJ1Y-0H1dCPYhNGCf2m_zx4hobtDSaCq7FXO8b1600\u00d7900 157 KB   4haQyQblyCyIdqoPJXBh9H2nOxbKYPFJISbFhRdi32l6G69cd2KiW7vgPuJBMrXi0nRdUAfJzc5DBzkcqSkrWuuDA1XiJ-cYPGn528WCzOcaSoSkKyZbFwcCAfVSshfKfi53iHsG960\u00d7540 42.7 KB   FxeCKK01rlA7_cZGvoRoDsuJuOVxGwlKCC3qMB6FSpQXpxJQGfg3kia-3PuXzg0rs4_ErOYgoQECEc-VbrIfaCFv_u1i22mDrozhl7O7egm6LSm8GaX9o5DML3skKGCVFICnWQ7E1600\u00d7900 133 KB   FBbxUv-hb4go5SE5yNOAZqt58gwl3GExFXw9D9pjlfwPuRsuyeB1VJ9Ez8EFz1bQr-C1AdZZwFyABF90hgvvrcHbEHnUmkdYeMoa406UTuBOzZX0WuWoXrwFREBOHB8jNCkCnCpy1600\u00d7900 178 KB   OfN-nhO8jI2BZ0O2DmQFfg9atrM-6QqT7EsFlpioBvRW4BxyA1GcmdubNGEblgC3mJqzv1_QUPavhUdI9Sy-w8JJ-Ex_lpRBAlHRt-2-3YKuQBO08p5uivkL-0z8adfV8MZ4mPeg1600\u00d7900 153 KB   H4MGcHRMcdvUQsG6KZuPQNAoDk6gLbjo6AFKH521rQ6K8T-41AAmsWc3_7jhSTB5HFo0r27Xz9Pft-G38pqroL00iUsJLrc35sZerwV1KVJ_aGLVtnwYlBCvVGL1FIUdtO4JcM3v1600\u00d7909 156 KB   LtGNkFh3_TH3WwOcotOQOc59OwGEud5K3CvLfPJUi-o1K7ZbkNUTAHoIeyvmG2PeOK6BHqw9wwnMYpHrv6Fxly4FlkmD49m12Ed_acTsc0W2tjfd_cFC09OBtmsGrD_ojK20wE4F1600\u00d7888 172 KB   1uaqaUZXEZ-L2AO3B7yE1bCbye_igS_HgB9lZc34GG2zNUrQXAEnJ-j--3kOyG5WNguoo7mFcoOIZSwUmoMy3djZZIJXEEp9l7hxELWrfw1Z9QDoSCf3W22PqZn4atSWa4XJb9CL1600\u00d7900 198 KB   MQWKFVc9S8Q0AHy0eXUdF3gTIGl6fkASZNtizevzPl6T2H2HkT0pnL_MEMVL3T0p3gS0C6Jr5SVDfU3G3ucKKesT4nvhgjYciK92OwP_JXvtjppNH4MmwphI5bVrXLhidmJtHV8u1600\u00d7900 170 KB   _CrT2G_gTWgBIziRUT8lCXCAODZ2-znIQgj2u85blYxnmZ4R6TYVUGnWwk4a3xrOdTmirjMxWlo_fQ-LbeDrp3HSHxY2gDXjY94H0g3_REQTrAQcUpvhgX6CbpUtW2jJpmjO1Uy11600\u00d7900 123 KB   Why is this important In a monolithic credit agreement design, the agreement would be in an ever-present state of amendment to properly define the type of collateral (same with the security agreement). Each amendment would then need governance\u2019s approval. As presently implemented, each new transaction (if the collateral did not attach the same as the others) would then require a LendCo to approach the DAO for a governance approval. Given the non-standard nature of collateral onboarding in the private credit space, this creates uncertainty for LendCo and LendCo\u2019s customers and would likely create delays that could cause LendCo\u2019s services to be less attractive than traditional lenders. From a practical standpoint, this is operationally impossible as properly securing each collateral type (outside of real estate) would then need amendments and put the DAO in a perpetual state of governance approvals of legal documents. It is our belief that overloaded governance cannot lead to good governance. Further, raising equity for such a monolithic design is problematic as some equity investors want specific collateral segregation and certainty around liquidation to be more defined before they will invest. The existing Credit Agreement and Security Agreement that the DAO has seen covers one specific type of real estate collateral. Given the scope of the DAO\u2019s future credit activities (including the Clean Money initiative), it will be necessary for the DAO to permit not only additional types of real estate collateral (commercial, industrial, multi-family, infrastructure, conservation, agriculture, etc.) but also other assets which are part of, or necessary to, such real estate projects (e.g., equipment, receivables, leases). Each of these \u201creal-world\u201d collateral types has different characteristics that must be covered in one or several new credit agreements and security agreements. Put bluntly, one size does not fit all.  Impossible to predict all use cases It is simply impossible for a senior secured lender with an expanded scope to know or draft (ex-ante) all potential use cases into one credit agreement. For example, how does one attach fishing rights in Florida as collateral? Or power purchase agreements with an Iowa utility company? While these examples are assets that might be used, one can imagine the cognitive load for LendCOs to continually approach the DAO for contract approvals or amendments, let alone considering the DAOs ability to properly evaluate such legal contracts.  Knowledge and expertise In addition to the above point of not knowing all potential use cases, certain collateral must be attached differently based on standard commercial practice. That is to say the DAO can and will learn how to properly attach collateral in many jurisdictions over time. Today however it is largely blind on how to properly do so, consistent with Delaware law or other U.S. / Canadian laws. The DAO would be far better protected to authorize a well-defined and well-documented scope and let industry experts structure, draft, and implement multiple credit agreements that attach collateral specifically rather than stumble through (and most certainly make mistakes that are easily avoidable by yielding to the Trust\u2019s legal counsel for both engaging with an ethics bound counterparty and providing the comfort of proper legal drafting). No different than the CEOs of two companies negotiating and agreeing on a term sheet. Neither will draft (or possibly even read) the nuanced legal documents, each will delegate that authority and responsibility to his / her legal team to ensure the underlying transaction documents are consistent with the term sheet (and are enforceable under applicable law). The DAO urgently needs to implement such a mentality.  Legitimacy A DAO can empower individuals to complete certain tasks. Further the DAO can grant authority. The DAO cannot however grant legitimacy or industry knowledge. Specifically for how to properly attach and secure collateral, the DAO should not empower mandated actors (or their teams) to learn / gate / approve this, as the \u201creal world\u201d already knows how to do this and will >> always << do it better. Rather, the DAO should rely on the intentional feedback loop with an Attester (or an Established Legitimate Party) and the Trust\u2019s & Trustee\u2019s legal counsel and not waste cognitive load on the legal minutia and debates by non-attorneys. The DAO needs to instead focus on the business terms and assess the overall risk of the Term Sheet (with the requirements outlined therein e.g. senior secured lien with a first-loss equity requirement), and which mandates it wishes to implement (and the area of debate and consensus).  RWA Attester and Portfolio Core Unit When working together in concert, an Attester & Established Legitimate Party alongside the Portfolio core unit provide a potent collaboration tool the DAO can rely upon. They in-effect annually \u201ccertify\u201d an Arranger / LendCo to operate within a Delegated Collateral Attachment credit authorization from the DAO. This is important as each operates to accomplish uniquely collaborative components. Ensuring known quality of underwriting is being performed at the LendCo level and all underlying agreements, including the drafting of the Credit Agreement(s). To that end, no one should approve an Arranger / LendCo, less MakerDAO. Rather an Attester should \u201ccertify\u201d them as compliant. (e.g. Not Rejected does not equal an Approval). As an Attester or an Established Legitimate Party must be pulled into the process during the drafting / pre-closing of any new credit agreement, a full circle feedback loop is created as a result to ensure quality and compliance. The DAO must clearly delineate the private entanglement of DAO actors (Core Units) from Arrangers; this is most pronounced when documents are being drafted pre-closing with 6s\u2019 legal counsel and legal counsel of WSFS (which represents both the trust and the trustee) along with input from an Established Legitimate Party. This separation of powers is an important prudent discipline to ingrain in the ethos of how we do Arrangers. Private entanglement is a slippery slope that can cause real problems and can be addressed and mitigated if implemented at the beginning. WSFS\u2019 requirement of common counsel for both the trustee and the trust was driven because the DAO cannot be represented by counsel.  Established Legitimate Party As further outlined in the sub proposal hereinbelow, the concept of a Established Legitimate Party is a private (non-DAO Core Unit) actor that must be ratified by the DAO who has the responsibility to ensure that any Credit Agreement that 6s assembles is consistent with the authorization outlined herein. To start, the first Established Legitimate Party will be RWA Company LLC. It is fully expected that Party may retain counsel to \u201cspeak the same language\u201d and interpret the markups of the drafts. To the extent it is useful, this process may also be done with non-confidential / redacted copies being published. Further, it is fully expected that other Observers may also do the same. 6s welcomes input in the drafting stage. One can imagine in the future large fully established firms (e.g. Ernst & Young) participate in this capacity.  Equity buffer for risk mitigation In addition to attaching collateral properly for a variety of use cases, each credit agreement would continue to have affirmative equity covenants (at both the company and series level). LendCos must raise equity to fill the first-loss position (or junior capital). To do so, a LendCo is faced with two fundamental decisions, pursue equity that will accept a \u201cpeanut butter\u201d approach in covering all collateral types OR equity wanting exposure to a specific type of collateral, leading to multiple Series each with different collateral types, each with its own credit agreement. The choice of how equity is raised is a strategic decision that should not concern the DAO, less it just has to be there. Rather anything that helps the LendCo raise that loss equity, indirectly helps the DAO, by mitigating its risk of loss. While either approach is possible, equity investors (especially institutional) will most probably opt for the latter as they want and need to price their risk and liquidation position with collateral they can understand (e.g. they may not want their preferred equity investment to have exposure to both wind power generation and a water desalination plant if they are energy investors). Without the above, the ability for LendCo to have a broad scope and raise equity is a challenging exercise. Moreover, given the SEC disclosure requirements for a U.S. equity offering, the required disclosures could either be too vague or so detailed that the offering document is hundreds of pages long. From a MakerDAO risk perspective, there is no downside to authorizing multiple credit agreements provided they function materially and legally the same as the existing credit agreement, allow collateral (all types) to be properly secured to the Trust AND allow LendCOs to more effectively and efficiently raise the first-loss equity buffer needed.  Moving the cognitive load For no other reason than safety and to ensure a senior secured structure is maintained with a variety of collateral types, the DAO should move the cognitive legal review load from the DAO to where it is best suited: the trustee, trust and their counsel. The DAO already \u201cTrusts the Trust\u201d to hold cash and liens. The DAO should delegate and extend that same confidence in their ability to ensure legal documents are drafted correctly to properly secure the collateral consistent with traditional institutional commercial transactions (provided a feedback loop is implemented, trust but verify). While it is a directed Trust, the Trustee can acknowledge DAO instructions (which are legally permissible and will not harm the Trustee) that are / will be relayed by the Trust Sponsor to the Trustee.  Will the DAO ever be able to gain the experience to properly know how to attach all collateral? Possibly. Should the DAO try, yes. Should the DAO always yield to experts, Absolutely! How does one attach fishing rights as collateral in Florida? Or aircraft in Oklahoma? The DAO will struggle to know, but experienced law firms already know how to do it better, safer, and faster. Period. Always. The DAO should focus on taking strategic decisions about the broad risk pools and sectors it wants exposure to. This should be done during the proposal approval process. Today the DAO does the same with attaching digital assets and rightfully delegates that authority to the Protocol Engineering team as not all ERC-20s are the same. Instead of relying on DAO nominated parties, we should use licensed attorneys that represent the Trust to the DAO\u2019s favor (as MakerDAO is the beneficiary), as they have the legal obligation to act in the best interests of their client as well having a Established Legitimate Party review during the drafting phase.  How do we handle the stability fee / risk pricing? As each credit agreement has (and will have) reporting requirements that LendCo must fulfill (or else be in breach), parties like RWA Company LLC (and other-nominated, and mutually-agreed upon, Observers) will see the precise list of loans (and all underlying transactional documents, including the underwriting), made per Credit Agreement. (The process to add / remove / replace Observers is further outlined in the sub-process outlined below.) As most of the lending risk can be computed from the financial ratios associated with a given loan, the portfolio of loans could then be priced after each reporting window. Further as more technological advances are made (e.g. a platform for RWA Company) an almost real-time information flow can be achieved for the risk-team to further evaluate and price the risk of underlying loans and allow for proper asset liability evaluation. That said, the more equity that is added to a portfolio (e.g. credit enhancement), the less risk for the senior secured creditor. This proposal includes a Stability Fee pricing design to allow for a hybrid of a treasury management buffer / capital battery at the Trust. For example, when the RWA001-A vault is set low (e.g. 0 bps), capital would be held in US Treasuries until such time as it is later deployed pursuant via the credit authorization outlined herein to LendCo, where the cost of capital will be a (RWA001-A + DSR) or 200 bps, whichever is higher. This creates a cost of capital floor to LendCo. This is important as it provides an elegant dual-purpose mechanism to unwind any treasury capital battery positions at the Trust without impacting LendCo and yet also allows the DAO to take full advantage of a Delaware Statutory Trust with an institutional regulated Trustee holding cash (or US Treasuries) with institutional safeguards in place >>> regardless of capital balance <<< .

Further, a future authorization may add, amend, replace, or terminate a previous one. While the authorization contained herein contemplates a variable portfolio weighted average rate, should a future project specific fixed-rate transaction be contemplated, 6s need only request such authorization from governance and complete the appropriate governance cycle to gain that authorization via a new authorization request as outlined in the sub-proposal below.  xza-KVHlsY-6inx9elBM_NS0mQc4gxSCbOq4FHSkerVYxkij3mHhsXiJ_AuzFftf4yCp7mA8_VBfdATolKIZ4l1m-el0qkCa03VqbTpPJU0rOS5bm0xiu-KCpC36ZXHusk7UBYqy1600\u00d7867 183 KB   Addressing LendCOs Credit Concentrations To start, concentrations will exist. It will take time to both grow and diversify a portfolio of senior secured transactions. LendCOs must acknowledge their intent to diversify with time and similarly the DAO must grant LendCOs the ability and time to properly diversify. The DAO started off with using senior secured commercial real estate as the first collateral to properly and securely attach. While by and large this will remain the majority of collateral for the immediate short-term, the DAO should not constrain itself to one form only. The DAO must learn. To do so, it must iterate and have industry experts opine and draft different documents that attach different types of collateral. There is no better way for that skill and knowledge to come to the DAO than for an Arranger / LendCo wanting to attach new collateral, and showing the world how to do it. Thus far, we have had to wait on parties to approach the DAO. This will not scale well. However, based on this proposal, a would-be borrower could approach a LendCo with a new unique type of collateral (that is in the clean money scope for example). LendCo could then either set up a new series (or form a wholly owned newly formed Delaware LLC), or utilize an existing one, without changing the risk profile to the DAO or burdening it with cognitive load. Should that LendCo or the Trustee determine that, to properly secure and attach a new form of collateral, a new credit agreement is needed, it would engage with the Trustee and enter into a new credit agreement and the DAO would always see the conformed versions and would learn. This last feedback loop is essential. Quite similar to how the SEC Edgar filings are public, seeing the underlying contracts for new collateral (its description and how it was attached) is a critical part of how the DAO will learn with time.  KBGME89A9QEpjKafl9fqbtisgBrzv7gM-9ORL3UpPEsq7czg-na9h1ZSn8PtNFEXufag_s6EAEqIxg0yL9UMdtB8rdXVO83bgM987qyJJxChsEUOYXYpgi1kzE-Xa0umbXbUJhwa1600\u00d71022 50.9 KB   VUcDr0xWGpvCjNV9a5FYrAMje8hfa-3dkUtCCFY1UN-IVakUXgeQQ2de1fyxhTUsaYWwb5hlWSFkOaGNfhJ4Qg0YOo9u6a4z6kM2jtfrSP-tuayie7JSZo5FdTbRl9t4lSOqu9o11600\u00d7902 43.6 KB  In a few years, one can imagine hundreds or thousands of credit agreements with many LendCOs (thus the existing implementation is actually rather rudimentary). The DAO does not possess (nor should it) the ability to run so many credit agreements while this is precisely what a trustee is built for. The DAO should leverage service providers and their legal expertise to ensure collateral is securely and properly attached and the covenants (financial / reporting / other requirements) are in each credit agreement. A compliance framework / feedback loop is an essential part of properly safeguarding the DAO to report any \u201cout of compliance\u201d events.  The spirit of the AAVE D3M but for RWA While not intended to technically replicate the Direct Deposit DAI module, there are many similarities that are worth noting. With the Aave D3M, the DAO is pricing the risk associated with Aave\u2019s ability to be a DAI distribution point, thus the obligation to properly secure such DAI with collateral has been delegated to Aave (and its engineers). Further, the DAO gains economies of scale by outsourcing many functions to known counterparties. As the DAO now prices the Aave D3M risk on aggregate, the analysis can then be consolidated. One can imagine a Compound D3M (or the next upcoming D3M) and the analysis needed becomes more manageable instead of the DAO managing the risk directly. That is to say, the DAO can focus on the risk associated with the portfolio of collateral, not the implementation of how to securely attach the collateral. This MIP is intended to largely replicate the operational spirit of the D3M but for RWAs and utilize a trusted institutional counterparty (the Trustee), that is both independent and regulated, and its counsel to handle and ensure credit agreements and security agreements are properly drafted / enforceable / secured in nature. With this we allow for a delegated collateral attachment approach for credit with an approved lending scope. This enables scale, not only for LendCo, but for the many other LendCOs that follow this path.  Hardware vs. Software Another analogy that may further crystallize the thinking would be to evaluate how to get additional functionality out of a given device that is planning on running an important function. In all scenarios, the hardware specifications must be known to evaluate the safety. Subsequent functionality can either deploy new hardware that requires re-evaluation of the hardware requirement each time, or use a known authoritative update server that can be designed to update the software on the existing hardware. Clearly the latter makes sense and scales better for new functionality. In this context, the existing Trust, Broker/Dealer, MIP21 are all hardware. They are known (Trust enforceability opinion) and verified (circuit test). The credit agreements and security agreements for new collateral are the software. The Trust\u2019s and Trustee\u2019s counsel are the authoritative server that provides the updates constrained to the scope. The objective of the hardware was \u201cto get the dollars to Delaware.\u201d Once there, held protected in a bankruptcy remote Delaware Statutory Trust, the software (the Credit Agreements and general corporate commerce) is then a known quantity where over the last 100+ years seasoned legal experts have perfected the ability to properly secure collateral with legal documents.  What power does the DAO retain? Regardless of what collateral credit arrangements the DAO authorizes, the DAO will >> always << retain power over the following:  Debt Ceiling (the aggregate for all credit agreements constructed from the Trust \u2192 6s) - Settning to zero impedes all downstream cash deploment Stability Fee  As designed, prior to any release of capital from the Trust, the Credit Agreements require the Verification Agent, Wilmington Savings Fund Society, to verify sufficient debt ceiling capacity remains before allowing credit to be released. Therefore, if the DAO wants to stop all lending activities, it needs only vote the debt ceiling to zero, and absolutely all subsequent lending activities downstream will come to a halt. Similarly, the DAO may change the interest rates that impact the downstream credit agreements as outlined in the term sheet. Finally, the DAO can reduce the debt ceiling to zero which will cease all lending and cause all collateral to be orderly paid-down across >> all << credit agreements. The above was designed to replicate the DSS as closely as possible but using the existing legal system.  Operational Leverage Under the assumption (and hope) that there will be many more LendCOs that approach the DAO similar to 6s (e.g. Arrangers), the DAO would be well-served to adopt the above delegated collateral attachment approach to allow for tens or hundreds of LendCOs while maintaining a flat quantity of Established Legitimate Party to handle this scale. While unlikely, it is imperative that the Arranger model / framework function in a sustainable resilient manner. We must even contemplate the scenario that the DAO one day has no core units, as the only thing constant with a DAO will be change. Certification of compliance with reputable parties (e.g. at minimum a Trustee and then others) must be built-in. By default, an arranger could always publish a redacted Borrower Compliance Certificate per Credit Agreement per quarter (Exhibit F of the Credit Agreement) in the forum to demonstrate compliance and rely on the Trustee. The objective being that operational leverage would then allow risk teams to focus on the portfolio of collateral rather than the implementation thereof.  Leadership Team Experience Matthew Rabinowitz has overall responsibility for 6s Capital LLC including managing the financial resources (banking, financing, equity capital) as well as the financial service providers (accounting, audit, insurance, and tax). He has run point on strategic planning / business development / creating strategic alliances / contract negotiation / SPV implementations & management including assisting in the overall strategy, negotiations, and contract support for a large (~10GW) renewable energy consortium including Boone Pickens, Fluor Corp., BNSF Railways, ABB, and Siemens. Thereafter, he assisted in the overall strategy, negotiations, and contract support for two Life Settlement Trust Certificate bond offerings utilizing a Delaware Statutory Trust. He co-managed two private placement debt arbitrage pooled investment funds. To achieve the best pricing on debt securities, he co-founded and ran back office operations for both an SEC Registered Investment Advisor and subsequently acquired a FINRA licensed Broker/Dealer. He co-managed an oil & gas SPV to acquire an operating oil field asset which was subsequently divested. Finally, he co-founded a commercial real-estate development firm and designed its corporate structure. Matt earned a Master in Business Administration from the University of Texas at Dallas and a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Texas Tech University. Matt intends to resign from his officer role at 6s Development LLC, an affiliate of 6s Capital LLC, at the end of 2022 (or sooner). In addition to pioneering the structuring for the first institutional Delaware Statutory Trust with an institutional Trustee for MakerDAO, the principals and officers of 6s Capital bring experience of a combined >$5Bn of historical transactions closed, including 30+ years of transactional structured finance legal experience in-house. The officers of 6s Capital have run regulated financial services businesses and are seasoned professionals that thrive in a compliance driven environment.  Arranger Delegated Collateral Attachment Architecture / Framework This proposal shall be later moved (subordinated) to being a sub-proposal of a future Arranger Delegated Collateral Attachment Architecture / Framework or as a MetaDAO, subject to MakerDAO governance approval.

We should all be cautious & curious if it were to happen too fast. Should this proposal be accepted, the community should expect that it will take 6s months of effort of engagement with equity participants as well as borrowers in different collateral sectors before any material capital is deployed. The current bootstrapped credit tenant lease (commercial real-estate) will continue to be the baseload loan origination space as new loans originated for other sectors come online. While deploying short-term cash into US Treasuries may occur quite fast, the downstream true commerce engagement is a sustained long-term effort. 6s is up for this challenge.  Specific Next Steps   Request For Comments - community discussion / debate (RFC)   Formal submission in the governance cycle (pending)   Inclusion of polls for proposal (pending)   Governance poll for proposal (pending)   Executive vote for proposal (pending)   This shall modify the outstanding debt ceiling to the proposed amount, modify the risk-premium to the proposed amount, and provide clear guidance to RWA International Ltd. and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, in its capacity as Trustee over the RWA Senior Lending Trust, of the DAO\u2019s consent and authorization to allow multiple credit agreements by and between 6s Capital Partners LLC (including the various or newly created series or wholly owned newly formed Delaware LLCs thereof) and RWA Senior Lending Trust for the scope and purpose set forth in the term sheet hereinabove.   An affirmative outcome authorizes RWA International Ltd. and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, in its capacity as Trustee over the RWA Senior Lending Trust, to create / amend documents to allow the Trust to hold U.S. Treasuries and engage a MakerDAO ratified (via the sub-proposal outlined hereinabove) SEC Registered Investment Advisor(s) to trade such U.S. Treasuries provided that the investment policy may be amended from the DAO based on the outcome of future \u201caffirmative vote of MakerDAO\u201d polls / executives.   An affirmative outcome ratifies @maarten from a MakerDAO perspective in the role as an Authorized Representative for RWA International Ltd. as well as the process to modify individuals / entities for that role in the future.   An affirmative outcome ratifies not only the proposal but also all of the included sub-proposals outlined hereinabove.   With this final action, LendCo shall be able to borrow USD pursuant to the above approved scope and have the Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, enter into various credit & security agreements with LendCo as determined by the Trustee to ensure all collateral is properly attached provided that the conformed version of both such credit & security agreements are placed in the public domain (e.g. via the MakerDAO forum) and legal opinions for the agreements must have been issued by the Trust\u2019s counsel prior to closing / use.

Further, this would require an Established Legitimate Party (defined herein) as an essential part of the feedback loop. Please read the entire MIP (including the addendum).  Important Updates since initially posting  The concept of having a downstream lending (from Trust outward) have its own debt ceiling). The Trust documentation will capture the spirit of the HVB Trust structure (which is modeled after the 6s Capital design) Prior to any new credit agreement being implemented, an external third-party (e.g. RWA Company or RWF) will engage a law firm to complete a document review. This law firm will view the transaction as if they are representing the interests of MakerDAO. RWA Company LLC or the other third party will report feedback from this law firm to the community. As the Endgame plan solidifes and MetaDAOs / ReformerDAOs come together, this vault & authorization shall be later moved (subordinated) a MetaDAO / ReformerDAO, subject to MakerDAO governance approval Reimbursement of transactional costs A liquidation may occur when the Trust Sponsor or the Trustee determine than an Event of Dafault (EOD) has occurred and shall coincide with a latest committed loan. MakerDAO may inhibit all downstream lending by reducing the debt ceiling to zero. The DAO (or some CU thereof) at its descretion shall retain the services of a reputable credit rating party to determine the underlying credit qualtiy of the collateral 6s brings forth. 6s shall then collabroate with that credit rating party to share the needed infromation on the collateral on a recurring basis, no less frequently than quarterly, to allow for a community report to be generated. First loss equity to protect MakerDAO shall always be at the Credit Agreement level that gets an independent financial audit, even if the vault is migrated to a MetaDAO in the future (which may also have another buffer).   Sentence Summary MIP72 authorizes 6s Capital LLC, as a Real World Asset Arranger for MakerDAO, to cause commerce by assembling commercial senior-secured transactions based on the authorization #001 outlined herein.  Paragraph Summary MIP72 (i) formalizes the use of revolving credit agreements by 6s Capital and Wilmington Savings Fund Society (\u201cWSFS\u201d), in its capacity as Trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d) of the RWA Senior Lending Trust, a Delaware Statutory Trust, and its independent trust sponsor to cause a delegated authorization for collateral attachment and credit for onboarding real-world collateral to meet the Clean Money Initiative, (ii) sets forth the scope of lending activity as further outlined herein and (iii) names 6s Capital as a Real World Asset Arranger for MakerDAO.

With a broader approved scope, 6s Capital can then focus on growing its lending operations within that scope, raising the needed institutional equity, running the operations, being in compliance with the Credit Agreements, and engaging with governance. Crawl. Walk. Run. - Part 1. Part 2. Part 3. Part 4. With MIP72, it is 6s\u2019 hope that other participants engage with the DAO and follow the path that 6s has set forth to also be an operating commercial lender. We need more LendCOs. What does an \u201cArranger\u201d do? In summary, an arranger is a DAO-empowered role that causes real-world commerce while doing so with \u201cchecks and balances\u201d based on a framework and scope / authorization approved by the DAO. Further, this role is one that should \u201crise-above\u201d the legal nuances (leaving those for licensed experts) and focus on core implementation, construct deals, and cause commerce.

The scope of the credit relationship between 6s Capital Partners LLC, a Delaware Series Limited Liability Company (\u201cLendCo\u201d) and the RWA Senior Lending Trust (\u201cTrust\u201d) shall be expanded as follows. First, the Trustee may in accordance with Section 1.1.h of the existing Trust Agreement dated 29 July 2021 (which already authorizes and envisions the use of multiple credit agreements, from time to time) (1) authorize and establish under Delaware law additional Trust Series under the Trust Agreement, as necessary, to engage in transactions with LendCo, and (2) modify existing or enter into additional credit and security agreements per Series with LendCo within the spirit of and which must operate materially similar to the existing Credit Agreement dated 29 July, 2021, between LendCo and the Trust, as amended, less the fundamental difference of attaching and securing different types of collateral, and be governed by the scope & terms stated in the Term Sheet herein along with all applicable exhibits including transfer instructions. The Trust Sponsor is also authorized to make changes consistent with the Trust language used here or here. Unless approved by the \u201caffirmative vote of MakerDAO\u201d, the Trustee may not change the definition of a Material Amendment in the Trust Agreement (e.g. any amendment to an existing or future Credit Agreement). Such vote, and the communication thereof, shall be communicated exclusively via the process outlined in the sub-proposal hereinbelow. Second, each new credit agreement must include a legal enforceability opinion (similar to the opinions issued on 29 July 2021, for the existing Trust Agreement and Credit & Security Agreements) prior to closing issued by the Trust\u2019s counsel. The DAO instructs and requires WSFS or LendCo to place a conformed (and redacted if confidentiality is needed) version of any newly executed credit agreements (with all exhibits) and their accompanying security agreements in the public domain (e.g. via the MakerDAO forum). The DAO will rely upon the Trustee and its counsel, to properly draft the legal documents, including necessary amendments to the existing Trust Agreement, new Trust Series supplements, new credit agreements, security agreements, opinions, and other closing documents to ensure that the collateral is properly secured and attached in favor of LendCo and by proxy the Trust in a manner commercially consistent with other similar transactions. Further, the DAO intends to contract RWA Company LLC, or another third-party (e.g. North Lakes Legal / RWF-001\u2019s counsel) to engage a law firm to complete document review. This law firm will view the transaction as if they are representing the interests of MakerDAO. RWA Company LLC or the other third party will report feedback from this law firm to the community. Under no circumstance shall any material term of the credit agreement such as its required reporting or covenants be changed to be less in favor of the DAO than those stated in the existing Credit Agreement dated 29 July, 2021, between LendCo and the Trust (unless the DAO specifically authorizes it). However, if a provision is not applicable to a particular credit agreement, it may be omitted. Further, the Verification Agent is instructed to not only be required to deliver a certiifcate about the status of the RWA001-A vault and its debt ceiling but it must also include a verificiation on the downstream lending activities (see MIP72c.A.10 -Modification of the Downstream Lending Debt Ceiling for RWA Senior Lending Trust). In addition, existing and future credit agreement shall omit the DAI <-> USD exchange risk liability from the downstream borrower (6s Capital Partners LLC) with RWA Senior Lending Trust bearing exclusively any cost / slippage / commission to convert DAI <-> USD. Also specific to RWA Senior Lending Trust and all legal infrastructure between it and the DAO, any and all historic set up costs and going concern costs (including but not limited to customary legal advice / legal opinion / formation / corporate service provider fees which may include the Trust Sponsor itself) shall be reimburseable from the Trust with support being presented to the Trustee and the Trust Sponsor (and RWF-001, subject to an NDA). In addition, all credit agreements must include information sharing (subejct to an NDA and no less fequently than quaterly) with a reputable credit rating party that MakerDAO (or a CU thereof) shall retain at its own cost to generate a publicly shareable report on the underlying credit quality of the 6s attached collateral. 6s must collaborarte with this rating party. Further, the Trustee is instructed to exclusively accept additional authorizations, modifications to existing authorizations, or termination of an authorization via the sub-proposal related to third-party communication outlined herein.  RWA Senior Lending Trust - Holding US Treasuries As the RWA Senior Lending Trust already holds USD in cash and other collateral under \u201cdownstream\u201d agreements (e.g. Credit Agreement(s) with LendCO), the RWA Senior Lending Trust shall be authorized to invest in U.S. Treasuries of diverse maturities in addition to (or substitution of) cash. Further, the Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall select and engage with one or more SEC-Registered Investment Advisors (\u201cRIAs\u201d), which may include an affiliate of the Trustee, to buy, sell or trade such U.S. Treasuries for the Trust in accordance with an investment policy (including desired maturity / duration etc). Any RIA(s) utilized must acknowledge (and the Trustee shall enforce) that the investment policy may only be modified by the \u201caffirmative vote of MakerDAO\u201d via polls / executives etc. and have such application to be an RIA for the RWA Senior Lending Trust be ratified by MakerDAO pursuant to the sub-proposal listed hereinbelow. Further, an affiliate of the Trustee may custody such U.S. Treasuries (or other future assets at the direction of the DAO) or Trustee may engage one or more Qualified Custodian(s) (as such term is defined by U.S. federal securities laws) to custody such U.S. Treasuries. The Trustee on behalf of the Trust may pay customary custody, trading, and advisory fees approved by the Trustee. As \u201cdownstream\u201d 6s Capital Partners LLC transactions close, the RIA for the RWA Senior Lending Trust shall then be instructed to exchange those US Treasuries for US Dollars to provide the capital pursuant to the Credit Agreement(s), or the reverse as the case may be.  pAXIXrg_b2ydS7wSO8I4LNqlpFmpEAruVTMNaI5z2hH4bjhFgdZyqv1sFuT-qNcWFTAZu-EKEnFm5yMdckQibIgfHzVWa88D6wVkCp5IPuiiOWgr5MAdQqruoFRqnZz_PlGZc-Hq1538\u00d7790 97.5 KB   Trust Sponsor (RWA International Ltd.) While the independent directors (regulated) of RWA International Ltd. make the decisions related to its operations, an \u201cAuthorized Representative\u201d role (aka Authorized Signatory) is being utilized in addition to execute day to day >> administrative << tasks. This role was initially filled / held by @maarten. He was selected from the list of approved Maker Representatives as he had the most commercial transactional experience, went to law school and was a practicing attorney before serving in the capacity as a chief legal officer of a publicly traded company, and had significant transaction structuring experience including taking a company public in the US (thus a familiarity and respect for regulatory hurdles before they happen while working with world-class service providers). While @maarten at this time chooses to maintain his pseudo-anonymity, he has however cleared KYC compliance for Walkers, Cayman counsel (which anyone who has engaged in the Caymans will tell you they are quite thorough) and WSFS. An authorized representative needs to have the following skills and requirements:  They must possess a deep understanding of the law They can cause Trust funds to be returned to the Vault Worked with world-class service providers (Corporate Directors / Trusts / etc) They must be approved and clear KYC at both the Cayman and WSFS levels  As the Independent Directors control and manage the Trust Sponsor (aka CayCo), they can, at their discretion, grant certain authorizations to an individual or entity. However, there is no intention for the Directors to delegate anything more than daily administrative tasks to an individual. For example, the Directors might authorize a person to sign an annual Delaware filing, sign the US tax return, engage an accounting firm, etc.) Make no mistake, the Directors are always in control of the CayCo. Under a credit agreement, there will be activity that was not anticipated when the agreement was signed. For example, the credit agreement may state that a lien under $1,000 is not a default. Be what if the lien is $1,050. Does it make business sense to declare a default and terminate the credit agreement over $50? Probably not. To address unknowns, a credit agreement will typically provide for (1) a cure period, (2) a waiver and/or (3) an amendment. Most events can be easily and quickly cured. In this example, paying off the lien cures the default. In other cases, actions cannot be undone and must be waived if the parties wish to continue under a given credit agreement. Other events may require waivers over and over and should instead be addressed by an amendment, so the event is not a constantly recurring default (if that is the agreement for the parties). This last option requires the affirmative vote of MakerDAO. In this context with the structure implemented, the Directors have the responsibility to make the final decision on if they grant a reasonable waiver for commercial agreements (as requested by the US Trust) that are in the best interest of the Trust. For example, a mechanics lien is a breach of a Credit Agreement (for good reason) but unlike code, life happens. Mechanics liens are common business practice in various jurisdictions to protect workers\u2019 rights to ensure payment. Should a mechanics lien occur (which is also a breach of the end-end borrower\u2019s loan agreement), 6s will pursue a remedy with the end borrower to ensure the borrower resolves the underlying dispute and have the lien removed. Sometimes, a waiver should be granted when it is in the best interests of all parties involved. Scenarios like a report being two days late on one occasion or a tax filing that has been reported and is being dealt with by a borrower should not cause a liquidation event. This is common best practice, though impossible to code. Any Director as part of their legal duties must understand the legal implications of such a waiver request. Independent Directors were selected specifically as a neutral professional was and will always be needed. Because of the power Directors have with regard to the above, they must have integrity (which is to say they do the right thing when no-one is watching) and comply with the statutory legal duties of a director. Given the legal exposure for the Directors, they would have no reason to waive any defaults unless such was in the best interest of the Trust, as they have a fiduciary responsibility. The process of influencing that decision-making of last resort is and will always be an iterative process to which the RWA International Advisory Committee (with a sub-proposal hereinbelow) is being created to provide recommendations, and MakerDAO-context where otherwise there might be a vacuum, to the Directors. While only a first step, we look forward to collaborating with the MakerDAO community / Real World Finance team / other to refine this engagement with time. The process to add / remove / replace the members of the Advisory Committee or the Authorized Representative at RWA International Ltd. is outlined more specifically in the sub-proposals listed hereinbelow. Based on the above and for the avoidance of any doubt, while @maarten is already in the Authorized Representative role and has already been approved and KYC verified at both the Cayman and WSFS levels, passing this MIP shall also have the effect of ratifying @maarten in the role for RWA International Ltd. as well as confirming the process in which Authorized Representatives may be replaced in the future. In this capacity @maarten has the obligation to perform in an honorable manner and conduct himself with his interaction with RWA International Ltd. with prudent business engagement. That said, he is only authorized for specific administrative tasks (aka no decision making), which do not include granting waivers or amending the Credit Agreements. Amending a Credit Agreement has been reserved and carved-out in the Trust Agreement to explicitly require the affirmative vote of MakerDAO. Further, Reporting Agents or Established Legitimate Parties will directly interact with this Authorized Representative as an additional overlay. 6s Capital fully understands that this interaction can and should impact the debt ceiling for this facility (now and in the future) as compliance to agreements and the feedback thereof is an essential component of any engagement. Moreover, with community members and RWA Company LLC as an Observer at 6s Capital while also receiving information from the Trust Sponsor (and / or an Authorized Representative, @maarten or his replacement) the community has complete end-to-end compliance coverage / visibility. The medium-term roadmap for this Authorized Representative role will be to add or transition to a member of the RWF team / a new Core Unit that has specific experience in this capacity, and / or a seasoned law firm that will serve in this capacity (or just remove all together), as there is no specific legal requirement to have an Authorized Representative. This role was created for convenience to handle daily administrative tasks that would otherwise be done by the Directors. An Authorized Representative must report all of its activity to the Directors. Any authority granted to an Authorized Representative may be revoked at any time for any reason by the Directors. In addition to the Independent Directors of RWA International Ltd., the Authorized Representative of RWA International Ltd., and the Advisory Committee, a new participant will be utilized to provide additional and independent protection for the DAO - a Trust Distribution Return Actor. As of the posting of this MIP, the current Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, Section 3.1(d)(iii) grants 6s the authority to cause the Trust to distribute funds back to the Trust Sponsor. As an interim solution, a power of attorney was executed and granted in favor of RWA Company LLC to accomplish the same (without amending the Trust Agreement). This interim solution, while effective, is being transitioned to a longer-term process as outlined in the sub-proposal below that would cause the Trust Agreement to be amended and restated to add / remove / replace with an external agreed-upon actor to be able to independently instruct the Trustee to cause funds to be returned. Until such time as an actor is selected and implemented, the power of attorney shall remain in force. The medium-term roadmap for this role will be to add or transition to a new Core Unit that has specific experience in this capacity, a service provider, or a seasoned law firm that will serve in this capacity. As a side-note: The entire \u201c6s structure\u201d would not be where we are today without the outstanding legal work done by 6s\u2019 counsel and @maarten. 6s is where it is today because of their steadfast assistance as well as their integrity and character (specifically the quiet help that can be discussed privately).  Covenants Please see the existing Credit Agreement dated 29 July, 2021, between LendCo and RWA Senior Lending Trust for the list of positive and negative covenants. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms in the Term Sheet listed herein shall govern the future financial ratio covenants.  Currency All transactions are planned to be denominated in US Dollars. For capital deployed in Canadian Dollars, a financial currency hedge is needed prior to closing.  Underwriting processes and policies - Underlying Documents Drafts have been shared for Credit Tenant Lease finance. Future underwriting documents are proprietary but consistent with previously shared documents.

All originated loans must be consistent with scope and ethos of \u201cold-school\u201d business / value creation while maintaining a senior-secured risk profile (with an investment grade equivalent probability of loss) and incorporating macro-economic factors to determine repayment viability. Transaction construction must incorporate the borrower\u2019s ability to make interest and principal payments (or have an interest reserve account) as well as prepayment provisions based on its operations as well as any other revenue contract enhancing its ability (e.g. a triple-net commercial real-estate lease). Such counterparties may or may not be \u201ccredit-rated\u201d by third-party rating agencies. In addition to the above, LendCo will conduct \u201cstress-test\u201d analysis to determine where transactions \u201cbreak\u201d and constrain activities as such. By utilizing the DSCR (debt service coverage ratio) or requiring additional credit enhancement from the borrower (which may include securing additional equity or guarantees in excess of standard business practice), blanket liens, or liens on other assets), LendCo can maintain a senior-secured risk profile (with an investment grade equivalent probability of loss).  Monitoring / Servicing / Reporting Initially, internally managed as the portfolio is intentionally small. 6s plans to engage Bellwether Enterprise, which currently services ~$37Bn, (and / or other highly qualified servicers) to ensure a robust resilient structure of receiving payments from borrowers as 6s grows.  Origination As outlined in our Target Portfolio Allocation above, 6s intends on a hybrid approach of bank-participations / wholesale lending / self-originating loans. In addition, 6s intends to work with our planned Fitch-rated servicer (Bellwether Enterprise, above) which also has a nationwide loan origination platform which exceeds $12Bn annually of senior secured transactions.  Existing Credit Agreement This authorization does not terminate the existing Credit Agreement dated 29 July, 2021, between LendCo and RWA Senior Lending Trust for commercial real-estate credit tenant lease finance, rather if ratified, this proposal would authorize the modification or replacement of that agreement in a manner consistent with the authorization outlined herein and allow any comments or concerns from the current Real World Finance team to be collaboratively integrated.  Existing MIP21 and Vaults or New Application As outlined in the motivation section of the Addendum, the \u201chardware\u201d is all known (the RWA Senior Lending Trust already exists, Broker/Dealer address, MIP21, and vault).

It seems clear that MakerDAO needs to onboard large amounts of real world assets in order to meet continual DAI demand. Leaning on my background and existing businesses, I\u2019d like to propose specific assets, structures and counterparties so that we can achieve this in the near-term to help build real-world DAI utility\u2026         Adding Real World Assets (\u201cRWA\u201d) as DAI collateral is a critical step for Maker to stabilize the peg... and in doing so, we change the world Governance       If Maker governance can rally around any singular point, it has been using market forces to align the DAI price to its current target reference currency, the US Dollar.  During a large portion of 2019, we saw SAI used primary as a leverage tool to acquire more ETH thus causing a surge in demand as excessive SAI minting pushed the SAI price below the reference price of $1.00  To combat this issue and due to a lack of other collateral outside of ETH and a lack of incentive tools, like the DSR, the\u2026     https://forum.makerdao.com/t/real-world-assets-ctl-document-roadmap-getting-started-v1/     Translucent Finance - Off-chain lenders Governance       In the course of ordinary business, many companies come in contact with \u201cconfidential\u201d information. Being a Lender the in the Credit Tenant Lease space is no different. In addition to reviewing the lease and the financial statements from credit worthy tenants, the financial costs to do a specific projects, or even the personal financial statements from the Borrowers (and their principals), a Lender comes in contact with a litany of confidential information. Further this is information that the L\u2026         Economics behind Real World Assets (\"RWA\") - Part 1 Governance       Background:  With the primary objective of MKR Governance should always be to keep the DAI price as close as possible to its reference currency, the US Dollar, MKR governance over the course of 2020 has for the most part lowered risk premiums to almost zero in an effort to spur DAI issuance to re-balance the price.  Such actions were and are justified. That said, there is a corresponding trade-off that we cannot ignore. Risk of \u201cdefault\u201d took a back-seat to the peg with regard to priority. This \u2026         Economics behind Real World Assets (\u201cRWA\u201d) - Part 2 Governance       As a follow-on to Part 1 of the Economics behind RWA, if we view the cost of capital from the lens of the borrower (especially when the cost of capital from Maker is zero), the interest paid can be viewed as a tax. Thus a similar economic theory surrounding taxation that can be found in the Laffer curve, will also be seen in the portfolio of collateral that is on-boarded within the Maker ecosystem. As such we can find and use a similar metric to help secure what is appropriate pricing from both \u2026     https://delcode.delaware.gov/title12/c038/sc01/     [\ud83d\udcc4] Collateral Onboarding Call #8: Centrifuge + 6s Capital - Wednesday, September 16 17:00 UTC Collateral Meetings       Time in your local-timezone format:  2020-09-16T17:00:00Z (UTC)   Dial In Details Zoom Call   Passcode:  314223   Intro Welcome to another collateral onboarding call, real-world assets edition, where we\u2019ll discuss potential assets for MCD, open for anyone to join.

Users are unsure how interest rates will vary, and hence what their borrowing liability will be.  The Direct Deposit DAI module (D3M) is designed to solve this problem.

Protocol Engineering and Risk are proposing to increase the D3M debt ceiling line to 100M. We propose keeping the gap at 25M and the APR Target Borrow Rate bar at 3.9% as they are today.   D3M Background The D3M acts as a stabilizer of interest rates on Aave. It has the capability to mint and supply DAI to reduce interest rates, and can likewise remove liquidity if demand is low i\u2026         MIP50: Direct Deposit Module Archive   MIP50: Direct Deposit Module  Preamble MIP#: 50 Title: Direct Deposit Module Author(s): Sam MacPherson (@hexonaut) Contributors: None Type: Technical Status: Accepted Date Proposed: 2021-04-07 Date Ratified: n/a Dependencies: n/a Replaces: n/a License: AGPL3+   References  The proposed code D3M Proposal Sentence Summary This proposal provides a smart contract implementation of a Direct Deposit Module for Maker.
