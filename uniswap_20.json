After browsing forks and pull requests, I don\u2019t see anything that indicates plans for any L2 integration. Are you looking for discussion on possible use-cases for L2 integrations? Could you elaborate a little bit on how you see Uniswap fitting into a Layer 2 solution and what benefits you expect/hope to see from that? I think this period of time is crucial for the future of Uniswap with the advent of so many L2 solutions and the emergence of alternative but compatible blockchains. This is a discussion we as a community should really be having in an unbiased manner. ",

Key advantages of this Layer 2 method being the below  image787\u00d7300 6.9 KB  They built a project late in 2019 with https://optimism.io/ called \u2018UniPig\u2019 that was a proof of concept for this Layer 2 scaling method. Other projects are using other methods, when I was researching this I saw Loopring\u2019s exchange as a concern. They use zkRollups  image735\u00d7444 11.4 KB  DiversiFi, is another exchange like Looprings, except it works with an order book, that I was interested in, it uses Starkware\u2019s implementation of Zero-Knowledge RollUps. I think the main benefit of Optimism is the ease with which the developer ecosystem can port over projects to an \u2018Optimistic\u2019 side-chain, without having to learn a great deal about new technologies or languages. Someone with more knowledge will need to chime in if you\u2019re wanting a clear and reliable understanding. ",
