It does the same things DAI does, but is as decentralized and immutable as Uniswap. I\u2019ve spent a few months designing and coding it.  Technical whitepaper: http://bit.ly/2Os1IKq  Solidity source code: http://bit.ly/37ZycUi  Topics: http://bit.ly/2GV10Bs  Business whitepaper: http://bit.ly/36YyA4f   Most novel thing here is price feed oracle design, and is in most need of feedback. Other cool things are getting rid of the likes of WETH, PETH, MKR and governance/voting altogether. I would also appreciate pointers to other venues where this can be more fittingly discussed, and apologize in advance if this is not it. Thanks, Nima ",
