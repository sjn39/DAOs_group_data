The two largest Uniswaps by ETH are DAI and MKR, so these would be good sources of collateral. It\u2019s easy to oracle the value of uniswap liquidity tokens based on their underlying assets. Uniswap MKR has 344 holders and a market cap of about $3.5mm Uniswap DAI has 752 holders and a market cap of about $2.7mm. Uniswap WETH never made sense to me but people still use it. 112 holders and a market cap of $2.5mm. If we accept WBTC as collateral, the WBTC Uniswap would also be a good candidate, being 50% ETH and 50% BTC and having 55 holders and a market cap of $870k. ",

Possibly, but probably not. Having MKR as collateral (even in diluted form) causes incentive changes that start affecting core aspects of the system. I\u2019m actually not 100% against MKR as collateral at some point in the future (to a very limited degree), but it\u2019s a fundamental and important change that has wide reaching consequences. If we are to include MKR as collateral, it should be explicitly, not as part of a Uniswap token. The Dai/Eth token is much more interesting to consider. I can see pros and cons there, but I still feel that the cons are pretty huge. @Jiecut lays out some great points (welcome to the forum, Jiecut!) as to the nature of that collateral. Likewise the WETH market is an interesting thought. Like you, I have no idea why people are trading it rather than wrapping it themselves, but it seems to be a proven phenomena. I wouldn\u2019t be against a risk analysis for Dai/Eth and Weth/Eth as collateral types. But there is definitely some complexity. The circularity of the Dai/Eth token worries me. ",

So if at ES, 10% of collateral is DAI backing minted DAI, and 90% of the collateral is \u2018real assets\u2019, it\u2019s fine because there\u2019s only 90% of DAI in circulation that needs to be backed.

Just doing a little napkin math based on the uniswap.info there was ~4MM in volume on uniswap between 3/31 and 4/06 works out to about $624k annually (@ 0.3% per trade).  Pretty sizable revenue given that the total liquidity pool mounts up to about $6MM. However, we can probably not worry too much about the problem of oracles for now. It seems that if we want to move forward with this then we need to start thinking about how to propose this given the current MIP framework. If we wanted to move that process along we would need to decide which of the uniswap-v1 tokens that we need to start with (as opposed to the 3 different tokens mentioned in the OP) and start a draft of the MIP that we would be proposing. Some quick questions i can think might help us make progress on those fronts:  Should this proposal be put on pause until uniswap-v2 is released? Are there other uniswap pairs that we should be considering? Should/can we start polling on the forums to figure out which uniswap pair is the most interesting.  ",

This idea might be a good candidate to start collecting feedback from the community on. Personally I don\u2019t think that very many of these uniswap tokens make for good collateral, but i would be pretty supportive of us adding the DAI swap token specifically. Looking at all of the other swap tokens they all seem to have a problem of either a small pool size in terms of NAV / transaction volume or the tokens are held by too small of a cohort. For instance, USDC has one of the largest pools in terms of Liquidity and volume, but about 64% of the swap token supply is held in the top 4 addresses. With those kind of numbers price manipulation seems quite possible. Additionally i think the DAI swap token specifically would give MKR an interesting lever to pull for the purposes of monetary policy. I.E you might be able to influence how much dai is listed on the exchange  through the DAI swap SF. This seems like it could be useful in situations like the one we find ourself currently where DAI has been trading above peg for some time even with near 0% SF on the collateral assets. But obviously those are just MY thoughts. Probably worth polling the forums to see what the appetite is for uniswap tokens generally vs just say the DAI swap. Maybe add an option for everything but the DAI swap as well since there seems to be some concern ITT about how it will behave in emergency shutdown? ",

                    "content": "FYI:  I managed to read this thread - some good discussion here.   I have actually been a liquidity provider to Uniswap V1 and have watched how implied value moves particularly with the ETH DAI pair.  I have to think about this somewhat since the real issue here is what happens if the DAI PEG is lost. ETH/BAT - that one I know for a fact (since I have liquidity there) is pretty much flat - it trades basically as ETH and so I think we can understand better how to manage this one. I am generally leary of the whole ETH/MKR pair.  Mostly beause I would rather see MKR in governance than in uniswap but really we need MKR liquidity generally so I am mixed on this one.   I think from a risk standpoing ETH/MKR generally trades together so would have a value mosty reflected by how ETH moves vs. MKR. I think using the Uniswap tokens are an interesting idea.   The ETH DAI uniswap was the most interesting for me since this one actually would move around a lot by definition and hence generated a lot of fees.  I think I came out up like 5-6% overall over 3-6 months of being in that. What is nice about these is that the pricing mechanisms for the base elements of the pair are rather well determined. One thing about adding collateral - we have to have auction process on virtually everything.   Given the low liquidity of the markets in these things and actual ability to add DAI (i.e. market caps really are tiny) I think we need to focus more on adding only a few bigger cap issues that can add materially to the ecosystem in terms of cap and DAI minted than adding tons of small cap stuff that basically has no liquidity.

We\u2019re only considering uniswaps for which the underlying collateral is already supported. A liquidator can redeem the liquidity for its underlying and use those markets.   Yeah but basically this is yet another collateral type that will require liquidators and DAI to support.    In the case of the ETH-DAI pair - interestingly the liquidator automatically gets DAI and only needs to sell ETH.  In the case of the ETH-BAT pair a liquidator needs to deal with 2x liquidation strings after the tx to uniswap to cycle DAI\u2026  It adds to the overall network load footprint by 2x potentially.  Where as the ETH-DAI pair doesn\u2019t. Also again.   what is the total $$ value of liquidity one could even hope to command here.  How much DAI (at what a lower LR?) does one think will be minted.    Right now this pair commands $6M in total liquidity.   Even if we get 1/2 of that it is $3M at LR of 150% that is what 2M minted (MAX) in reality to stay away from Liquidation we\u2019d want to see 300% - so this would be $1M. Everyone here seems so hot to just start adding tons of small cap collateral types - that virtually are all correlated.  For what kind of return.  even at a SF of 5% this is 50K DAI/year to support the whole system with collateral vault, liquidation, system governance activity. While I have grave reservations about growing this system before we actually work out the issues in the existing one.   I still want concpetually to be able to grow this system when we are ready. Literally would need 1000 different collateral types at $1M DAI each to get to $1B.   This conceptually looks like a complete nightmare vs. finding ONE single collateral type that can grow us to $1B. Frankly we burned 200K of ETH through liquidations - this is $20M( at $100ETH) that could mint at 300% 6M of DAI.  Fixing this problem so instead of $20M we liquidate $2M and maybe make a higher SF, and make people feel better about the stability and robustness of this system FAR more rewarding than adding 6 collateral types that mint $6M of DAI and making the system less robust and stable. If we are really going to talk about collateral types why don\u2019t we start talking about centralized costody and whether the community is ready for some of these or not.   BTC is still highly correlated to ETH but it does have a cap that is attractive.   PAX or some of the gold related tokens also interesing,   Even the real-estate tokens are interesting. While I think uniswap is interesting - going beyond ETH-DAI seems pointless.   MKR/ETH seems hazardous - but has some appeal because liquidating MKR may finally create at least some idea of a MKR liquidation market through the UNI-V1 MKR/ETH pair.  Maker could also use some of the surplus DAI as a kind of fund to purchase MKR/ETH at liquidation auction prices for burn - creating a more effective burn market and potentially a small liquidity backstop to the Uniswap MKR/ETH auction pair. My point.  Lets talk about best approach to adding a few key collateral types, but focus on ones that could add forms of stability and real value (via depositable cap + DAI growth + SF)  to the system not a piecemeal bit approach to growing the system.  $1M at a time. I want to hear ideas about whether we can finally take on the 100B gorilla in the room BTC honestly. Everything else feels like chump change.    And I really don\u2019t want to burn our $20B ETH market participants either like I feel like we have been doing lately with this laise faire approach to how our key users (ETH owners) got hammered borrowing in Maker recently.   If we fix this for them - the rest will come naturally and easily.   Maker alone could exist on $1-2B ETH deposits and perhaps 10-30M DAI SF revenue a year. ",
