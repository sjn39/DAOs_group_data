                    "content": "MakerDAO is the decentralized minter of the Ethereum ecosystem, pioneers in Decentralized Finance (\u201cDeFi\u201d). The MakerDAO protocol minted the DAI stablecoin asset, which acts as a hedging tool and medium of exchange directly on-chain. The cornerstone of DeFi is overcollateralization\u2013always having more collateral than assets minted\u2013which means that there is always room for incentivization of a third party to pay back debt on behalf of borrowers, keepers being repaid and retributed by borrowers collateral through an action mechanism. The MakerDAO protocol proved itself resilient to a 94% drop of the value of ETH in 2018 during the SCD era and the black Thursday event in March 2020. The MakerDAO protocol is heavily overcollateralized\u2013each makerDAO vault is an independent entity in a mutualist system, with its own collateralization ratio and thus liquidation price. On this basis, the overall DAI collateralization risk should be analyzed according to system global collateralization and critical collateral price levels creating levels of liquidation thresholds.  Data analysis of DAI collateralization  1357\u00d7163 16 KB  5.5B$ of ETH collateralized for 1.53B$ of DAI minted. ~360% collateralization on ETH-A vaults DAI has seen significant growth since Ethereum\u2019s \u201cDeFi Summer\u201d of 2020, growing from a 289M DAI supply to a 3.1B$ supply in 7 months ~+800%  1327\u00d7283 21.3 KB  The current \u201cglobal MCD DAI collateralization\u201d is currently historically low due to recent debt ceiling increases at around 230%. Typically 3 USD worth of collateral backs each DAI when considering the protocol as a whole.  1426\u00d7192 12.2 KB   Exploring D3M Currently, there is simultaneously a stablecoin liquidity shortage in DeFi as well as high demand for stablecoins in DeFi protocols to be used for earning rewards or leveraging/borrowing, which creates high interest rates that potentially could have a negative impact on ecosystem growth as a whole. DAI \u201cliquidity crush\u201d also creates a significant premium between \u201ccost of money\u201d defined by makerDAO Stability Fee and supply rates on protocols such as Aave. In theory, the free market should create itself an equilibrium as the premium gap is an earning opportunity for interest rate arbitrage actors. In reality, market immaturity, more lucrative investment opportunities, \u201cYield Farming\u201d by leverage loops deposit into DeFi and Debt ceilings limits the natural balancing of premiums between mint cost and supply earnings. Moreover, DeFi is constantly evolving and new products further increase the demand for Dai across the whole network. The D3M is an exploration of an alternative path to bring more liquidity in secondary DAI venues by minting DAI backed by aDAI and depositing it directly in secondary markets to release liquidity shortage pressures. The D3M module is a potential new tool for the MakerDAO to stabilize DAI peg, increase DAI attractiveness for borrowers and create new pathways of revenues for the MKR ecosystem. Additionally, the Aave Community is deploying new liquidity pools across various L2/chains, which means more DAI can bridge into pools to transact affordably and in an inclusive manner, while still ensuring the security of the MakerDAO collateral in L1. Essentially, Aave could become the distributor for DAI on every L2 and empower new growing communities as the need for stablecoin as a medium of exchange grows across all chains and L2s. DAI backed by aDAI could be minted leveraging the overall protocol overcollateralization, with limits in size and timeframe set by global protocol collateralization target ratios and secondary market rates target ranges. The focus of the D3M is to mint & Burn DAI in exchange for aDAI to stay within the Target Max Variable borrow rate of DAI in Aave Liquidity Pools.  Mechanics of D3M The D3M module mints and directly deposits freshly minted DAI into the Aave V2 protocol, and by doing so, the D3M vault module collects an equivalent amount of aDAI (which grow over time based upon the fact that the Aave DAI pool generates interest). The D3M has a target rate for limiting the size of the deposit and ensuring DAI to be the most competitive asset to be borrowed on Aave compared to other stablecoins. The target rate is fixed in such a way that the variable borrow rate does not exceed a threshold value. This threshold value can be set by the MakerDAO community to ensure that DAI is the most attractive stablecoin for Aave borrowers. Interest rate curve model allows for precise sizing of mint/burn events for more information on the interest rate curves on Aave, please refers to the dedicated documentation. The size of the vault could be experimental and later adjusted by the MakerDAO governance as there is more market data. Eventually D3M has the potential to become a global way for the MakerDAO community to inject DAI liquidity across DeFi and even incentivise risk-averse protocols by adjusting liquidity between protocols. D3M would be the natural step for MakerDAO to expand DAI across DeFi and ensure market positioning as new stablecoins are evolving, including Compound Cash. Working together with the Aave community could position both the MakerDAO and Aave communities uniquely to ensure DAI liquidity across DeFi and decrease the liquidity fractionalization on L2s in mid-term.  What is backing aDAI? aDAI is an automatically-generated, native token to the Aave protocol, which is issued to a user who supplies DAI into the Aave protocol. aDAI is astandard ERC-20 token, which is natively balance-increasing such that the DAI pool on the Aave protocol generates interest to all suppliers to the DAI pool. he aDAI smart-contract continuously updates the balance of all aDAI token holders (including D3M Vault) to reflect this accrual by increasing their aDAI balance. As with every deposit into the Aave protocol, there\u2019s no lock-up period and withdrawal can be requested at any time within the limits of available DAI liquidity. There is no slippage associated with aDAI and every aDAI is redeemable for one DAI at a 1:1 ratio. Suppliers of aDAI are covered by the Safety Module (managed by Aave Governance) in case of shortfall event. DAI itself is backed by the systemic overcollateralization of the lending market, where overcollateralization is based on the Aave Risk Framework. Additionally, Gauntlet is performing on-going analysis on the V2 borrowing market\u2019s Market Risk and other related risks. Additionally, there\u2019s currently ~1.6B$ worth of AAVE and AAVE/ETH in the Safety Module with a 30% slashing parameter activated, meaning that nearly up to 0.5B$ of deposits are protected in case of a shortfall event. Benefits for MakerDAO  External source of direct income by collection of aDAI interest MakerDAO governance would have direct impact on risk assessment by adjusting the D3M minting across DeFi Expanded supply of DAI including L2s DAI attractiveness for DeFi borrowers on secondary markets If Aave community starts a Liquidity Mining program, MakerDAO will collect AAVE assets and earn governance rights in Aave Governance  The technical implementation for D3M module is described in MIP-50 posted by @hexonaut. Kudos to @marczeller and @statelayer for contributing to put the discussion proposal together. ",

The implementation is not too much different from just adding an aDAI vault, but we get the added benefit of targeting a desired interest rate on Aave. This will allow Maker to continue having the lowest rates in the space. There is also no messing around with the Stability Fee and vault owners - we just get all the interest automatically. That being said, this addition is not without risks (as with all collateral additions). I\u2019ve outlined what I perceive to be the risks and security considerations in MIP50. In particular by more closely integrating with Aave we expose ourselves to both smart contract and liquidity risk from their platform. We have to ask ourselves whether the benefits outweigh the risks. I believe they do. I posted on the Aave forum as well if you want to discuss with the Aave community. Looking forward to the tighter cooperation between these two DAOs. ",

One consideration. The target rate (R) will likely have to be greater or equal (\\geq) than all SF of all collaterals of MakerDAO: R \\geq \\{ \\max_{c}SF_c | c \textnormal{ is a Maker collateral}\\}. For example, now we have SF=6% on BAT-A. If we set R on Aave at 5%, this will make Aave more competitive than MakerDAO when borrowing with BAT. So we need R\\geq 6%. I think this prospects a direction where we can get rid of small-cap collaterals like BAT (and many many more to come over the next few years) and leave their \u2018management\u2019 to Aave. We should need to remain the best vanue for borrowing with very large DC collaterals such as: ETH, WBTC. Of course this means that we will have to manage the risk of Aave failing. So:   POSITIVE:  we can lend a lot more DAI for small-caps coins like BAT, without consuming the precious time of the devs and risk-teams and governance (voting time, fatigue).  NEGATIVE: We are getting more exposed to Aave risks.  ",

But I fear that leaves us really undiversified in risk both from the perspective of being at the mercy of Aave and increasing reliance upon ETH for our own line of business. We need lots and lots of different revenue streams, but don\u2019t want to just hug an external partner while they pick our pockets. Correct me if I\u2019m misinterpreting  ",

This will allow Maker to continue having the lowest rates in the space. There is also no messing around with the Stability Fee and vault owners - we just get all the interest automatically.   Worth noting that we can target a desired interest rate with a traditional aDAI vault as well - there would just be a little bit of an interest rate spread to accommodate vault owners\u2019 cost of capital and profit margin. Eg if we made an aDAI vault with 110% liquidation ratio and 8% stability fee, this would soft cap the Aave DAI rate somewhere in the 9-12% range (equivalent to a ~10-30% return on a leveraged aDAI vault).     iammeeoh:  I think this prospects a direction where we can get rid of small-cap collaterals like BAT (and many many more to come over the next few years) and leave their \u2018management\u2019 to Aave.   In a way I agree, this sort of arrangement can help Maker and DAI address long tail asset borrowing demand. But I don\u2019t think aDAI exposure is equivalent from Maker\u2019s perspective. Secondary lenders like Aave and Compound use a pooled risk model which has higher risk of insolvency - if any individual collateral asset blows up it can be used to borrow the remaining assets. I\u2019m not sure if this asset is suitable to accept at an effective 100% collateral ratio. Edit: In the example above the Aave supply rate would be soft capped at 9-12%, with the borrow rate being somewhat higher based on the interest rate model and utilization. ",

                    "content": "@PaperImperium currently the stablecoin supply across all Aave Protocol markets is around 1.5 B USD worth (V1, V2, AMM and Polygon L2). DAI market share is around 13,74 %. Being able to mint directly from D3M would mean that the borrow rate of DAI would decrease and we would see swaps and loans positions opened in DAI instead of other stablecoins. From technical risk respective, the V2 of the Aave Protocol is audited by 5 different independent auditors and formal verification is done by Certora. More on the audits here. On the market risk and stress testing, Gauntlet should publish their official report within the next days that covers V1 and V2 markets. Since D3M is bespoke feature and changes the dynamics of MakerDAO to become lender to lenders, I think it\u2019s better to be as much risk-averse as possible and start from conservative debt ceiling. @iammeeoh in Aave Protocol first line of collateralization is the asset overcollateralization in the protocol provided by the borrowers. However, if there is some kind of short fall event such as exploit or failed liquidation, the protocol has Safety Module that backstops the deficit. In practice, Aave community members stake AAVE into the backstop module and receive incentives to allow 30% of their stake to be used per every potential slashing event. If the slashed amount does not cover the whole deficit - then there is Recovery Issuance similar to MakerDAO model which aims to make the protocol as whole. MakerDAO was used as an inspiration to build this part of the module. The Gautlet Market Risk Assessment report also covers the Safety Module and its dynamics. One of the Main concerns is that the SM consist mostly of AAVE currently, however the Black Thursday events works as a precedence that even minting new supply did not affect MKR value substantially and might guide that backstopping protocols with protocol\u2019s tokens works in practice. @PaperImperium on the revenue, the D3M factually create a new revenue stream to MakerDAO since it would mean that liquidity could be injected even when it would be most needed and risks can be fairly mitigated by capping the total exposure on D3M, I would see it as a way to enable more DAI liquidity as well for assets that might be smaller caps that could be financed against in secondary market protocols like Aave Protocol. Interesting value proposition is also that with Aave markets, DAI could be distributed across L2s where Aave Protocol is being deployed meaning that DAI would have more advantage of being not only the medium of an exchange but the yielding stablecoin of that particular network, which would empower users that do not afford to use DeFi in the current gas costs.

Gauntlet simulated and stress tested scenarios by decreasing the liquidity of secondary markets where collaterals are traded and decreased the value of the collaterals. The findings of the report should also help the MakerDAO community to assess the stability fee for D3M. ",

Yeah, there is a catch, you depress DAI lending rates so people will sell DAI to USDC to get higher yield. The dynamics are super complex so it\u2019s hard to forecast what will happen. But it might not work well at scale. ",

You are not really backing DAI with DAI. aDAI is backed by the collateral portfolio of Aave, so really it is not much different than Maker where we are backing DAI with ETH, WBTC, etc. ",
