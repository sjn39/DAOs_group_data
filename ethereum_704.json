Amxx:  I believe that rather than questionning the protocol (Ethereum) you should consider questionning the wallet. What application sets the gas price to 0.1eth?   I think it was not a wallet but a programming mistake. There where multiple transactions sending too much fee: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/as7ejb/reminder_be_careful_while_developing_someone_just Also this account does not look like it was managed by a wallet - it looks like automatic actions. So I think solving it on the protocol layer is a good option. Not by allowing reverts obviously - but by adding a cap to the ETH that can be spend for gas (as the title of this post). I think this could improve the UX of Ethereum. This is not the first time this happened - and I think users of ethereum that stepped into this problem did not really like the experience  ",
