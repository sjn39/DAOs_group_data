My name is LongForWisdom; I\u2019m MakerDAO\u2019s Governance Facilitator. I\u2019m joined by a bunch of other Maker people, 31 and counting. I think we have some meaty updates from the various domains, so hopefully, it\u2019ll all balance out.   A quick preamble for those who haven\u2019t been here before. Feel free to interrupt and ask questions if you want to while someone else is presenting or talking. I\u2019ll let you know if it becomes disruptive, but please, we\u2019d love to hear from you.   Before we dive in, I just wanted to give everyone a reminder. It\u2019s the time of the year where daylight saving becomes a thing again. This meeting used to be set in the PST time zone, and it\u2019s now set to UTC, which means it will jump for one hour for those in the Pacific time zone, I think, where it wouldn\u2019t have before. Just be aware that it\u2019s going to move by an hour when your daylight savings stuff happens. I can do this reminder for every meeting this month.   Discussions happen in the Forum.   Governance LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 02:33   Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread   We had some good discussions this week.   Primoz from the Risk Domain team recently posted on the Forum about the surplus buffer and the stablecoin issue I alluded to earlier. This is interesting and it explains some of the problems we are going to face with the stablecoin vaults and the surplus buffer.   We had a cool thread from Matt Rabinowitz calling community members to fill the new role of the Maker Representative, which is a role that will help make an interface with companies in the real-world through the goal of onboarding RWA. It\u2019s pretty interesting there, and we have more people than I expected to be volunteering for that role, which is great to see. Thanks to all who did volunteer. I believe there\u2019s going to be a signal request following up shortly, if not already.   We also had S_ben from SourceCred post the final report from the trial. We\u2019ve continued the trial. However, this is a summary of the first three months. By objective and subjective metrics, it seems to have gone reasonably well; at least it\u2019s been more positive than negative, which is good, and I think it matches my anecdotal impressions.   Signal consensus-wise, I don\u2019t think we had any new signal requests this week, but we\u2019ve got some that finished recently. Matt Robinowitzhad just mentioned in the chat regarding approval of Maker Representative for RWA. We had \u201cShould we take a more flexible and transparent approach to collateral onboarding,\u201d which was on-chain this week, and it has passed, which is cool to see. Stay tuned for some updates on that later in the meeting.   The signal request to add ETH-B for a collateral type also passed on-chain although there\u2019s a note on that and the smart contracts team will give an update on that as to when it will happen.   Next week, we have the Rates V2 signal request moving on-chain.   Also worth mentioning is that the signal request to increase the auction surplus buffer has ended without reaching consensus whether to either increase before or after we begin doing flap auctions.   Other Governance things I want to note: I mentioned this last week, but I\u2019ve made some updates to the forum, changing some categories around a little bit. We now have a Collateral Onboarding category, which will have everything to do with collateral onboarding and other minor changes. If you have any feedback, let me know. I hope it\u2019s a positive change. People have told me they liked it, so that\u2019s good.   I\u2019ve also scheduled a new meeting, entirely optional, on Monday afternoons at 17:00 UTC. It will be a loosely structured and formal meeting to give those of MakerDAO a chance to ask questions about Governance. I will be there every week, but there\u2019s not any set agenda. It\u2019s kind of a \u201cshow up and ask questions\u201d if there are things that you don\u2019t understand, or things you want more clarity on.   Discussions   Increasing Surplus Buffer  Primoz from Risk talks about some of the reasons to increase the surplus buffer.    Calling community members to be a Maker Representative  mrabino1 speaks about the Maker Representative role and puts out a call to the community to measure interest.    Signal Requests   Should we take a more flexible and transparent approach to onboarding collateral?   This vote suggesting changes to the collateral onboarding process is currently on-chain, ending very soon.    Approve Maker Representatives as an oversight role for Real World Assets  mrabino1 proposes to get a formal signal from the community whether they would like to approve and implement a Maker Representative for RWA.    Add ETH-B Vault Collateral Type  Aaron_Bartsch proposes adding an ETH-B vault and uses this signal to crowdsource the initial parameters.    Rates V2  hexonaut proposes the existence of a working group whose responsibility it is to propose rate changes in response to risk and the wider DeFi environment.    Increase the Auction Surplus Buffer (System Surplus)  Aaron_Bartsch proposes adjustments to the protocol surplus buffer either before or after MKR is burned.    Weekly Updates Chris Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 06:48   There\u2019s a big update this past week.   Last week, we did the weekly spell, which changed the base rate to zero. We also increased the debt ceiling on PAX and USDA to 100 million, and we approved the new TUSD implementation, which I think went live yesterday, October 7th.   The team also did collateral assessments for YFI as well as BAL and GUSD. In the mandated actor meetings, we discussed LEND and AAVE and decided that we would table that for now. They are in the middle of a migration, and we want to see their new token consumption. We want to see them dogfood their token first. Once they think their token is ready, then we should add the token. I don\u2019t know if there will be any objections to that, but I think that\u2019s probably the safest course of action.   Brian and Lucas worked on some tooling for executive spells, and we did two big things.   We pushed our Spells: Kovan Repository public. These are all of the spells that we use to create executives for anything we would deploy in Kovan.   We also pushed the Spells: Mainnet Repository public.     The mainnet repository starts with the executive spell that deployed MCD, so it has a full history of everything we\u2019ve done since the deployment of MCD there. That\u2019s going to be very useful if you are an integrator or especially for all the people that are working on technical MIPs. You can now get an idea of not just what the executive spells look like but, more importantly, the thing that\u2019s been private this entire time has been our integration tests against those deployed executives. If people see other things that they want to update, ways to make it safer, take a look at those integration tests. That would be great.   We also posted a Liquidations 2.0 technical summary; Please read through that. Next week we are planning to have a stakeholder discussion for Liquidations 2.0. Suppose you are expecting to use the new liquidation system or use the old one and want to know stuff about transitioning. In that case, this is probably one of the last opportunities the community is going to have to be able to add suggestions which may change the code and design before we perform a code freeze, so please check that discussion out. I think it\u2019s on October 14th.   We\u2019ve also posted the debt ceiling instant access module technical MIP. Review that, if you get a chance. This should, hopefully, set debt ceiling adjustments to automation with a few parameters adjustments so that we won\u2019t have to deal with manual intervention all the time.   Also, something very exciting is that we\u2019ll probably have some flap auctions coming up. We did a little update to the dockerized auction keeper for anyone that wanted to spin up auctions. I think that if you look in the keeper channel, there\u2019s a video on how to use the auction keeper to do flap auctions but the dockerized auction keeper should be very turnkey. Just read the section titled \u201cREADME\u201d and once you get it going and it should spin up without very much effort. Check that out if you get a chance.   We also posted the MIP26 for dss-gov, which is going to be a replacement for ds-chief and should have many more features which the community had asked from Governance. Check that out. You could make suggestions, and we would probably be able to mutate code.   For the coming week, we are planning on working on the collateral onboarding priority sheet. It\u2019s a framework for how we\u2019re going to allow particular things to bubble up to the top. The domain team will probably be going through and assigning weights to stuff on that sheet. I\u2019m sure someone will talk about that later.   We are planning to move the join adaptors that we have to a different sort of \u201ceasy-to-use\u201d public repository in attempt to make documentation for collateral onboarding easier.   We will work on collateral assessments for UNI, PAXG, REN, BTC, and tBTC. Hopefully, we will get to all of those, but I don\u2019t know how long it will take. This is something that may require many weeks to complete.   I want to mention that ETH-B is probably not coming out this Friday because it was too short notice for the smart contracts team, so we will likely be working on onboarding ETH-B as collateral for not this executive, but the executive after that. Even though the poll said tomorrow, we need another week.   The domain team is planning on reviewing MIP14, MIP17, MIP22, and MIP25.   Discussion   LongForWisdom: I\u2019m just going to make it clear that the ETH-B postponement is largely my fault for not communicating properly. Apologies, and I\u2019ll try to avoid that in the future.   Chris Mooney: Well, now we\u2019re on a more adaptable collateral onboarding.   Brian McMichael: Even so, we don\u2019t want to be in a position where we\u2019re writing code and deploying contracts if there\u2019s a possibility that it may not pass.     LongForWisdom: I have another question regarding the liquidations 2.0 stakeholders meeting. Will you be running a similar meeting for the dss-gov changes at some point?   Chris Mooney: Yes, I think that\u2019s probably a really good idea, I didn\u2019t have it on my list, but I will schedule something.  LongForWisdom: That will be great. Thanks!      Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 14:14   We resubmitted the oracle assessments for YFI, PAXG, and BAL. We also submitted the MIP12 yesterday on behalf of the other domain teams for Yearn(YFI) and Balancer(BAL.) That was mostly to secure some of the collateral onboarding for the month, but now since the vote passed to do a simplified collateral onboarding, we should be able to tackle at least a couple more for the month.   Concerning longer-term projects, we have an internal Oracle running for Uniswap to LP tokens, so that works. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s production-grade yet, and to feel comfortable putting something like that in production, I think it probably needs some more work and some more sets of eyes. We\u2019ll try to run that by Hayden as well as some smart contract wizards that we know within the space. I can share the source code for that pretty soon. I want to finish running up some tests to get the low-hanging fruit, and then we\u2019ll open-source it so everyone can start pointing what is wrong with the thing. Hopefully, we can get Uniswap LP tokens soon. I think that will be a big deal considering how much liquidity some of those have. The USDC, DAI, ETH, REP, and BTC seem to be pretty popular pairs on Uniswap at the moment.   We are also starting to look at the Balancer side of what we can do for a Balancer oracle. It\u2019s a little bit different. Uniswap has a unique way of calculating normalized types of reserves. Normalized being if you construct atomic transactions, you can move the two assets\u2019 ratios using the flash load. With Uniswap, you can reconstruct a normalized ratio immune to that ratio imbalance, but with Balancer, that seems to be a little bit harder. I\u2019ll be talking with Fernando to see what he thinks the best solution will be for that particular issue.   Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 18:27   We published YFI and BAL collateral risk evaluations this week. Evaluations were made by our new members Will and Monet Supply, and I think it\u2019s cool to see more community participation inside the Risk Team at Maker.   PAXG and GUSD also are being finalized and will be released within the upcoming week. But what we are also currently working on is ranking assets from the greenlight pool that aligns with the new flexible approach to collateral onboarding, which has just passed today. I think this was mentioned already. Nonetheless, we\u2019re filling this newly established prioritization table that should be publicly available soon, and hopefully, we should soon have all the proposed assets ranked, which should give us a better idea of priority when we evaluate them for collateral onboarding.   We also started preparing a new framework for calculating ongoing risk premiums and competitive rates. This is in line with the post that Sam published where the idea is to start using new rates setting approach, I think, on October 19th. The idea is that we would already have some document prepared where we would suggest specific rates on this analysis that would be applicable, and it would finally be proposed by this so-called rates working group.   Finally, as LongForWisdom had mentioned, I posted this text in forums today suggesting to increase surplus buffer due to the fees on the debts from stablecoin collateral explaining that I believe we can\u2019t rely on full collection and therefore, it might be a bit inappropriate to start using that money for surplus auctions. I think we can debate it a bit later where I can outline some of my thoughts.  LongForWisdom: Yes, we will bring this up for debate another time.    Amy Jung Community Development Team Update 20:53   I\u2019ll begin with the Community Development side. We have a really exciting collaboration that will happen soon with Kleros, and it\u2019s going to be a co-fellowship for a collateral legal assessment framework. There is going to be an official announcement coming soon. You guys are getting the first teaser.   The second piece I want to mention is that Governance Communications, as you guys have seen, have been creating these snippets that are shorter versions of both the G&R summaries and Maker Relays. One thing is, if you guys have feedback, whether you think it\u2019s is great or don\u2019t use it at all, or how it could be better, all comments and feedback are really useful for the team. It allows us to improve Governance Communications.   We had six meetups granted and hosted during September. We continue to fund meetups for all individuals interested no matter where they\u2019re from. Please, if you have people who are interested or maybe you want to host a meetup, you can reach out.   I want to bring light onto our YouTube channel because we have all video recordings of the collateral calls and G&R calls. Most of these videos have summaries attached to them as well. In additon, we have Community calls. The most recent video is about how to participate in a surplus auction with ETH.   You\u2019ve seen badges go live last week. Please, redeem your badges on the Forum. I know that some people have been doing it and that is pretty awesome.   We also funded another grantee and will be announcing more grants soon.   1980\u00d71063 93.4 KB 1290\u00d7715 194 KB   Yesterday, I posted a new MIP for an Operational Support Domain on MIP28. By the way, these have QR codes for the forum post itself. I know it\u2019s pretty long, which is why I want to give an overview of what it is. It\u2019s going to be pretty intimidating when you see it but essentially you have the main domain information in the first component, then there\u2019s facilitator information in the next three, there\u2019s no support facilitator and contributor list but I will get to that in a second. The last two components are pretty standard; There\u2019s nothing crazy in it but I am proposing myself as a facilitator which I\u2019ll get into in a little bit as well.   I\u2019m going to cover the first component regarding main domain information and what the operational support domain is supposed to be. It\u2019s mostly focused on development and management of distributed operations at MakerDAO. What does that mean? If people have worked in operations or if you know people in operations, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint what exactly that is because it varies from company to company, or organization to organization. This is something that I\u2019ll get into more details in a bit as well, but mostly it concerns cross-collaboration as we\u2019re going to have more and more domain teams as well as individuals, which will make sure that MakerDAO\u2019s resources are allocated more efficiently across the teams. I just added a small bit covering the philosophy. I believe that one of the main objectives is to keep the domain teams independent and autonomous in terms of how they organize their own teams and resourcing, as well as getting and receiving the resources. This is something to keep in mind in terms of how I envision this domain moving forward.   2019\u00d71094 51.3 KB   The support domain has three main functions:   One is General Operations, which I\u2019ll get into in a little bit.   Then we have the Cross-Domain Team Coordination as I mentioned across different domains, across the different teams. As we grow more, it\u2019s just going to get a little bit more complicated. Right now we have a good amount that is more self-sufficient.   Finally, we have Grants Management and Distribution, which is a lot of what we\u2019ve already been doing. It\u2019s just now formalized a bit more into a role.     1964\u00d71072 73.5 KB   I\u2019ve separated them in two kind of functions: short-term and long-term. We are in this transitional state where the DAO is just getting settled into the growth period soon. Because of that, we obviously don\u2019t have a lot of domains and therefore the short-term function of this operational support is actually just to bootstrap some of these initial ones. It\u2019s mostly because we don\u2019t want to pop up too many domains very quickly, so it\u2019s kind of alleviating that pressure and a part of that is around the third function, which is how we bridge and manage these resources from the Foundation. The Foundation is a good resource; it\u2019s a validated point of how we\u2019ve been able to bootstrap the development. Now we are trying to decentralize a lot of these operations.   Then, there\u2019s been questions around financials and related things but going from Foundation operations to decentralized MakerDAO is not a clear one-to-one, and we\u2019re just trying to facilitate that in a secure way because we do have shared managed resources. That\u2019s where we are trying to iron out the details.   Part two is this idea of a minimal operational framework concerning how resources are distributed, what resources are distributed, and then the guidance documentation around them that will be coming soon. This is mostly what I\u2019ve been working on. As I mentioned, it is not that straightforward, therefore we are trying to work out something transparent that is really simple and easy for people to understand.   The final short-term function is about support. We\u2019re going to be more hands-on with the domain teams. We know it is a weird transitioning, especially if there are teams coming from the Foundation. As we grow, we are hoping to make that a little bit more scalable.   That leads into the long-term functions. There will be a way that we need to identify what kind of bottlenecks and opportunities there are for us to be more effective in the coordination. Currently, we are just trying to get things done but you guys are starting to see a piece of that when it comes to Collateral Onboarding, for example. We are doing this as we speak, but it\u2019s just more formalized. I think it\u2019s important that we incubate the smaller working groups and proto teams early on to catch and identify them. We will be able to nurture that so they can turn into a more formalized team.   Then, as I mentioned, the budget proposals and payments are coming soon. We\u2019re working with finance now to figure out:   What would be a good kind of MIP framework for that as well as the onboarding.   How should the main teams onboard.   What do they need, etc.     Eventually this is a piece of the account permissions, so we are going to have shared MakerDAO resources, which are going to be owned by the Dai Foundation. We are trying to figure out what that process looks like.   The final piece is a sub proposal that\u2019s attached to the domain. That is all about what the domain itself is and what it\u2019s supposed to do. I\u2019m not going to go into details to sell you my credentials. You can do that in this separate QR code that will lead you to the sub proposal, but essentially this is a lot of the work that we\u2019ve already been doing. We\u2019re just formalizing it a little bit more. For me personally, I\u2019ll just be working a lot more on the resourcing: the people side, how we help individuals and keep this diverse background and recruit more people into working for domains as well as the onboarding, what does that experience look like, and then the grants and bounties that we\u2019re currently doing. I\u2019ll be creating incentives, for example, the Collateral Onboarding grants are a part of them.   I really encourage you check the MIP itself and ask any questions.   Discussion   LongForWisdom: I would just say, personally, that I\u2019ve been working with Amy more since Rich left, and I\u2019ve been continously impressed by her. Thank you for making my life easier. I hope this will pass and you\u2019ll make everyone else\u2019s lives easier as well, which you have been doing so far. Does anyone have any questions now?   Frank Cruz: Would you say that you could recommend people who already work in HR, Finance? If you have friends or friends of friends that work in that department, or if there\u2019s something that you think someone can do as a side gig, or  does it require 100% focus in order to be effective?  Amy: As our process currently fits, anyone can propose themselves as a facilitator or a contributor. We actually do have someone that will be helping on the cross-domain collaboration side. I don\u2019t want to out people because I think we haven\u2019t yet went through the full conversations, but a lot of the resources, for example, we are getting support from a lot of the people in the Foundation in order for the Foundation to have a people\u2019s team. We are welcoming contributors at that level, I think more thoughts by experts in certain areas are always welcome such as in Legal or Finance. Definitely feel free to introduce them, and if they feel that they want to represent themselves, they can as a support facilitator.    Frank Cruz: Zooming out into the future, two years from now, I guess you couldn\u2019t have an attorney that works for a large law firm and then also works for the Foundation, right? That just wouldn\u2019t work. I mean, to convince somebody to go from Finance or HR into this field, they might not understand it. So to recruit someone that has already been working for a large company who are the head of HR, it might be difficult to get them to come to work for the DAO in the year 2023. I\u2019m just thinking ahead, but maybe too far ahead.  Amy: If I\u2019m hearing this correctly, there are kind of part-time options or ways to experience what someone can get from ground zero and transition to working in the support domain. That\u2019s essentially the onboarding stance that we want to clarify. I think that everyone has that question across the board; \u201chow do I work for the DAO,\u201d \u201chow much do I have to know,\u201d and things like that. This is something we are building. There is definitely part-time opportunity, which is also part of why we have grants. Grants are a great way to propose something if someone is not necessarily wanting to work full-time for the DAO but still want to contribute to something like a legal assessment framework. We are trying to create the structure for people to be more on the contributor level where they can be loosely tied. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a full-time job, and then there are also domain facilitators who are able to be more focused on that as full-time. There is some kind of leveling in terms of commitment. What\u2019s important is that Governance just wants to know exactly who is working full-time and where these main resources are going.    Juan Collateral Call Update 34:50   Chris and Primoz already mentioned that they\u2019ve been working a lot on the framework to be able to prioritize different collateral types and be able to be as transparent as possible with the broader community in order to have a sort of scientific mechanism that is be able to focus our energies, so ideally this will help all the domain teams come together.   Yesterday, we had a very interesting call, and this is looping back to what you mentioned earlier during GaaG regarding the post by Matthew Rabinowitz. He made a concise presentation, and then he answered many of the questions that every participant had. It was very interesting. The video is already on YouTube. Gala is already working on the notes for that, but we should have like a summary to help with that topic. If you want to join the \u2018RWA\u2019 working group, reach out to @SebVentures on RocketChat or in the Forum. We\u2019re happy to move this forward.   The last topic we had yesterday, an exciting call with Matt Longo from Keep Network and Fernando from Balancer Labs. It was super enjoyable; again, the video is on YouTube so you guys can check it out.   Next week, Wednesday 14th at 5 PM UTC, we\u2019re going to have Lung, the CTO from REN BTC\u2013I hope I am not mispronouncing his name\u2013as well as Hayden from Uniswap. We\u2019ll be discussing these two exciting projects. Please join us. The agenda is already in the forums. Join us; I believe these calls\u2019 beauty is when people show up and have interesting questions, which makes them rich conversations.  LongForWisdom: Yeah, great, thank you. I don\u2019t often go to those meetings, but I went to the last one with Matt from Keep and Fernando. It was good, it was interesting,and you learn more about both projects. There were some great questions from various people.    Charles St. Louis MIPs Update 38:18 1437\u00d7761 124 KB 1440\u00d7766 235 KB   We had a lot of MIP proposals come in this month, which is very exciting.   We had MIP14, which allows the protocol to transfer Dai to specific addresses.   MIP20, It\u2019s the target price adjustment module which was extensively talked about for the last couple of months, proposed by Led.   And then we had two RWA proposals.   Lastly, we\u2019ve got MIP23 domain structures, and roles, which is a new structure on how to onboard domains and manage them and looking at the roles of facilitator and contributors and how those are structures and communicate together.     If anyone of the authors wants to speak after I finish my segment, they can go ahead and give an overview of what those proposals are, as well as anyone in the call who has injected these documents on GitHub or the forums.   1437\u00d7766 181 KB 1436\u00d7770 228 KB   We\u2019ve also seen a lot of new proposals come into the RFC Phase. Those MIPs are:   MIP17, which is a rewrite of the original one that was looking at DC adjustments as well as RP adjustments. However, this one now is proposed by PlanetX, and it\u2019s only for the weekly actual DC adjustments. I highly recommend checking that out, looking at the logic, and seeing if people agree is how we should move forward.   MIP24 is an emergency response system proposed by John Athman, which was proposed a couple of weeks ago, but it should be eligible for November.   We have the MIP25 Flash Mint Module by Sam, and that was a follow-up to the declarations of intent for creating a flash module for Maker. This is the technical implementation of that intent.   Next, we have the MIP26, which is the Governance contract redesign, called Dss-Gov. It includes a vote delegation functionality.   Then, there is the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module, which you can think of as an automated version of MIP17 although there are some differences. So if you\u2019re looking at MIP27, then you should look at MIP17 to compare and see if the manual processes transfer over to the automatic one.   Lastly, as Amy mentioned, there\u2019s MIP28, which is the operational support domain definitions, ultimately defining the entire support domain and if it were to be approved, what the actions the domain would take in helping facilitate and running the DAO.     In terms of sub-proposals, we had a source cred funding proposal. I haven\u2019t looked at that one yet. If anyone is on this call and wants to provide more information, please do.   We had another sub-proposal as a follow-up to MIP28 to onboard Amy as a support facilitator.   Lastly, there is the sub-proposal for Calendar exceptions, which is an amendment to potentially skip, for lack of a better term, the December governance cycle.   Look these over. If people are opposed to them, we could perhaps do a shorter type of governance cycle or go over the weekly cycle in the meantime. But it\u2019s a topic that people should go over and consider, and I think, LongForWisdom, if you want to talk a bit more about that after my segment, please do.   1435\u00d7768 178 KB  The Collateral Prioritization Framework will be made public, either today or soon. I guess someone else can provide an update on when it will be public, but this will be very good, as Juan mentioned, because it will provide transparency and a general idea of which risks and metrics are being taken into consideration when the domain teams are deciding which collateral types they want to prioritize for each cycle\u2019s onboarding.  1435\u00d7771 160 KB   If you\u2019re interested in that, you can go check them out under the proposal ideas category on the forums. If one of the authors wants to talk about any of their proposals now, I think he can go ahead.  Matthew Rabinowitz: I\u2019ll be covering mine. Rather than taking too much time of the community for this call, I\u2019ve set up a call, and it starts at the end of this call to do an extended Q&A. I\u2019m going to leave the link for the Zoom meeting for the forum post. If you can join for that meeting, that would be great to answer any questions about it and talk about setting up a secure lending structure to the loan capital to off-chain projects.    LongForWisdom: Great, thank you, Charles and Matt. Anyone else wants to describe their MIP\u2019s briefly? I think we heard about many of them a couple of times already, so maybe that\u2019s not super necessary. I guess I will just briefly talk about mine.   The proposal to skip the December monthly governance cycle is because the default ends, I believe, on December 28th, which is not great for several reasons. Everyone\u2019s going to be busy, So I think it\u2019s unlikely that it will come out with particularly representative results even if it does go forward, which is why I suggested that we skip it for December. We\u2019ll still have the weekly cycles, though we might skip the very last weekly cycle again. If you guys have feedback on that, feel free to drop it in the forum thread.   The other element that I pressed was MIP23, the domain structure MIP, which defines a template for domains to define themselves using the MIPs process such as Amy\u2019s operation MIP. An example of that template use seemed to go reasonably well. It may have been super complicated for some people, but what I\u2019m hoping is that template is better than just trying to write the whole thing from scratch.     ",

All of them seem to meet the requirements to be formally submitted. All eight of those will have inclusion polls on Monday, October 12th. We won\u2019t include the collateral onboarding sub-proposals as part of this monthly cycle because we will be including it in the weekly cycle.   Other Presentations and Updates  Vishesh Choudry  The State of the Peg 50:47 MCD System Stats MCD System Stats Alt DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs Maker Vault Stats  1419\u00d7670 166 KB   1421\u00d7664 116 KB   There\u2019s not much to say about this week. If you look at the volume for DAI-ETH trading, it\u2019s been comparatively lower than, let\u2019s say, a couple of weeks ago. It\u2019s been sitting pretty much smackdown at a 1.01 USD and exhibits the same distribution of trades across different exchanges. It doesn\u2019t change much. The price graph looks very similar to two weeks ago, or more or less for the last month, with mid to low volume trading pretty much around 1.01 USD as well as minor fluctuations in both directions. I think the general sense is that with uncertainty in ETH price and with an absence of the creation of a bunch of new farming opportunities in the last couple of weeks, things have been comparatively quiet.   1423\u00d7492 104 KB   1394\u00d7452 55.5 KB   If we look at some of the collateral types, we saw a smoothening of the liquidation ratio walls for ETH, except for the lowest one, which has persisted, and still around 280 USD. The funny thing is that with ETH price moving, that wall has stayed. There\u2019s been some collateral management there, but we\u2019ve seen this kind of sloping distribution of collateralization ratios of most risky to least risky, so the interesting thing is that overall this is an increase in the liquidation risk for ETH.   1425\u00d7605 138 KB    We\u2019re sitting at around 860 million DAI minted, 340 million ETH, about 360 million from USDC-A, 75 million from WBTC-A, 56 million from TUSD, 300 thousand from MANA, and 25 million from PAX, as well as smaller amounts from LINK, LRC-A, COMP, ZRX, KNC, USDCB.   So, it\u2019s the same story as last week; A decent chunk of the collateral portfolio is essentially in stablecoins, and there hasn\u2019t been significant movement in those minted amounts, nor have there been significant movements in price over the last week. Therefore, I would say it has been pretty quiet.   If there\u2019s a specific thing people are curious about, I\u2019m happy to answer. However, the general idea is that there hasn\u2019t been much movement over the last week.   Matthew Rabinowitz: Do you see a slowdown with the number of vaults created? Or a slowdown in the number of collateral per Vault?  Vishesh Choudry: Well, if we look at collateral per Vault, there are a fair amount of vaults that are smaller with little amounts of both debt and collateral, and there are also a fair number of vaults that have a quantity mid-to-large of collateral but very little debt in them. That\u2019s this bucket; there\u2019s about 17 million DAI from ETH, at least, where you have vaults with very little debt but have some collateral sitting in there. They still exist. Maybe we can touch on creation rates next time, but in terms of where most of the debt lives for each collateral type, that has not changed. Where you have, say the top five or six vaults, for ETH, it\u2019s even much more significant for WBTC and the stablecoins where you have a few of the largest vaults accounting for a substantial chunk of the debt there. I would say ETH is one of the more robust portfolios where you have a lot more distribution of this debt, but even still by and large, when it comes to vault types, a few large users account for a decent chunk of your core supply. Any other questions?       Discussion 56:45   LongForWisdom: Okay, so we\u2019re going to be moving into the more general Q&A, discussion section. Maybe Primoz, you want to start a discussion around the surplus buffer and stablecoin stuff?   Primoz: Yes, sure. So, I made this post today, and I will drop the link here in the side chat. The post concerns around potentially increasing the surplus buffer. We need to think about the day we\u2019re going to be filling the two million surplus buffer and, from then, are we going to have flop auctions? The issue I\u2019m having is that I believe on a daily term we are accruing about 50.000 DAI of fees from debt on stablecoin collateral. The problem I\u2019m seeing is that we know those fees won\u2019t be collected entirely. We are aware of the issue we\u2019re having with a low collateralization ratio and the outcome via self-unbinding or liquidations, and there are some uncertainties. How effectively can we collect those fees that the system accrued? And, from my standpoint, at least from a Risk\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t seem reasonable to be spending money which we don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to be able to fully collect. It is a risk to spend it on flop auctions because if we are to do so, what we are effectively doing is that once the money is spent on flop auctions, when we have this unwinding, we will realize that just a proportion of the accrued fees, the surplus buffer, can be drained. This is because 50 thousand per day is 1.5 million per month, so if we postpone this and then we do unwinding at some future date, potentially, if we unwind it with a lower collection of fees, we would be draining our surplus buffer. I want to avoid this because the surplus buffer is meant to protect against unexpected losses. However, in this case where we already know there might be some impediment, which is why I was suggesting we already increased the surplus buffer to avoid the situation. Long story short is that the more flop auctions we\u2019re going to have, unless we don\u2019t increase the surplus buffer, the higher probability of flop auctions will follow in the future because we would be just wearing the 2 million surplus auction. This is something that I want to avoid, and that\u2019s why I was proposing to increase the surplus buffer.   Chris Mooney: You know, the alternative here is that we change the stability fee from stablecoin down to zero. That would be another way to keep the surplus buffer the same. There\u2019s one nice benefit to having the surplus buffer kicking off flap auctions, which is that you could think of MKR as the sort of buffer in case we end up in undercollateralized territory and we need to mint a bunch of MKR via flop auctions to re-collateralize our system or to take care of that bad debt, which happened right after black Thursday. That ends up removing this kind of cushion in MKR - like the amount of buffer that we have of value accrued there. So one of the nice things about flap auctions is that they sort of wind it back up again and provide a cushion if we need to mint MKR. The other nice thing about flap auctions is that we\u2019re above peg, and these auctions will release some of that debt onto the market. So, I think that flap auctions are important. Whatever needle we throw right here, I agree that this is a moderately urgent issue that we should figure out. It would be nice that we could keep the flap auctions in place so that they would have their own even small impact on the peg and rewind that capacity and the cushion up in MKR.   Primoz: Yeah, I agree on the positive effects of flap auctions. In regards to shutting down or disabling stability fees, maybe a downside of that is that for all the new positions that are being potentially established, you wouldn\u2019t be charging anything but, you know, the new positions are mostly the ones where you can collect some fees so you wouldn\u2019t be maximizing your return if you disable those fees prematurely. Therefore, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s so wise. Otherwise, I agree. Also, I forgot to mention that the last time we increased the surplus buffer to two million was right after black Thursday, and the DAI supply was around 100 million. I\u2019m not sure, but now that the DAI supply is much more significant. We know that half of the supply is on stablecoin, but the other half is still at least four times bigger, so just from a risk standpoint, we should have a larger surplus buffer. Ideally, you should always aim toward a percentage of the DAI supply. Only from a risk standpoint was I going to propose we increase it. This thing has some trade-offs, but it\u2019s up to the community. From a risk standpoint, I need to mention this.   Christopher Mooney: You brought up a great point there. We can collect some fees on these vaults; we have to cut them off at some point. That makes me wonder what if, as we get closer, let\u2019s say within a 10th of a percent, we\u2019re at the one-to-one sort of ratio? Those vaults would be liquidated either way. What if we had some executive that swept them into a new vault type, and then some kept that vault type around for when we get offloaded either through liquidations or something else so we\u2019d be able to collect the specific fees on these things. Therefore, when they\u2019re all tapped out we sweep them off to some other vault?   Primoz: I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m following if I\u2019m honest.   Kurt: Imagine how different it would be from zeroing out the DC on the existing collateral type, and shutting off fees and then starting a new one.   Christopher Mooney: It\u2019s effectively the same thing.   Kurt: How would you implement what you proposed because you\u2019d never actually want to loop over all open vaults or something in an executive, right?   Christopher Mooney: Yeah, the only downside there with what I\u2019m suggesting is that if you did end up looping over whichever ones were bad, you wouldn\u2019t do that on-chain, but you could find them and effectively trigger some manual sweep. Facility A(FA) remains the collateral type that everyone uses. We can slide everything over onto another vault type that has liquidations frozen temporarily. We get to collect the maximum fees on everything. Otherwise, we have to shut down FA and then move over to some other type, and there would be some stuff in FA where we don\u2019t collect the maximum fees.   LongForWisdom: You mean the USDCA, right?   Christopher Mooney: Yes, that\u2019s what I meant.   LongForWisdom: Yes, just double-checking.       SamM: So, I don\u2019t think I quite understand. What would be the point of pushing them over to this new Vault facility?   Christopher Mooney: You get to collect the maximum amount of fees until they\u2019re at a one-to-one ratio, but you know you can\u2019t. You know that you\u2019re going to accrue bad debt if you liquidate them, so you move them over to some other vault, and they just become Maker reserves at that point until we\u2019re below peg. Then we unleash auctions in them and create some DAI demand that brings things back up.   Sam M: So, would the owner still be able to close them?   Christopher Mooney: No, I think this would be we like the vault itself. It has gone out to liquidations. This would be the equivalent to saying you\u2019ve lost your collateral because it\u2019s under-collateralized and it would move over to this other vault type so\u2026Anyways, this might be too complicated. As I said, I literally just thought about it.     brianmcmichael: And the result here is that the protocol ends up owning these stablecoins, so it seems kind of similar to the PSM idea in that we end up holding these stablecoin bags.   Kurt: Pretty much. So long as they never get to a point where it\u2019s profitable to repay them, then the protocol will end up owning them one way or another. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s technically feasible to try to do mass seizures and execs or something of that sort. You could change the way liquidations happen to these vaults and then give some incentive for keepers to do it for you, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the hassle of trying to isolate the ones that are underwater versus the ones that aren\u2019t. I propose in the future we introduce new collaterals with a fixed window for taking advantage of them so that they\u2019re all on the same schedule and every three months or something, we introduce a new USDC collateral. I mean, give the people a week or two weeks to join it, and then basically they\u2019re all on the same fee collection schedule, and you could shut them off as they get to that under-collateralized point.   Matthew Rabinowitz: But at that point you\u2019re basically just gating. Let\u2019s say you have a waterfall of USDC-A, B, C, all the way to F and, as A fills up, you shut off the debt ceiling, drop it down to zero and now you\u2019re blocking the entrance if you will, which will force it into letter \u201cB.\u201d No?   Kurt: Yeah, exactly.       Gregory di Prisco: Can I chime in quickly? I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot for the last month, and I want to clarify a couple of points. There is nothing wrong with letting these vaults go under 100%. It doesn\u2019t harm the protocol unless we start burning MKR with that DAI. I would advocate that instead of us spending our resources on something that\u2019s not a problem, we monitor the surplus buffer like Primoz initially suggested. First of all, this isn\u2019t even a problem until any vault in USDC-A is under 100%, which isn\u2019t going to happen for at least 45-50 days at this SF, and even from there, you watch that debt and every week if you need to increase the surplus buffer to make sure that that debt doesn\u2019t burn MKR, then that\u2019s all you have to do. I don\u2019t think that this is a major problem yet.   LongForWisdom: So, Primoz made a point with me the other day, that it\u2019s all well and good, but if there would be a bad debt situation which happens, then it will be canceled by the surplus buffer which doesn\u2019t exist, and DAI will not longer be 100% backed. That is also something to consider.   Primoz: Yes, that\u2019s a bit of an edge case. Well, maybe not an edge case, guys, but yeah, basically, if you have a loss event and the surplus gets drained, you would develop an ambiguous situation.   Kurt: Yeah, from a risk perspective, if you know that you have a large amount under-collateralized or underwater, specifically vaults, which have actual bad debt and you know that\u2019s in the surplus buffer, then you need a little extra cushion on top of your surplus buffer in case of emergencies. However, that\u2019s a risk related discussion in order to evaluate the pros and cons.     Gregory Di Prisco: Yeah, I think that\u2019s a risk related discussion. Also, keep in mind, if the worst-case scenario happened and there was unbacked DAI, the Maker holders could manually trigger an option and raise funds. It\u2019s no different; it\u2019s just a different sequence.   LongForWisdom: Yes, that\u2019s true. We would then be forced to potentially liquidate them when we\u2019re above peg.   Gregory Di Prisco: Now we do the flop auction.   LongForWisdom: No, but this is the point; flop auctions wouldn\u2019t trigger because the protocol would think we had enough money, but we actually wouldn\u2019t have enough because the USDC vaults would be underwater.   Gregory Di Prisco: Yes, but I am saying is you will have to do it manually.   LongForWisdom: Yeah, I guess you probably could do that.   Gregory Di Prisco: And this is such an edge case that if we get to that point, I would rather deal with it manually anyway.     Christopher Mooney: How do we envision performing the increases regarding this? Would we do this every week, or go up by a little by the amount of bad debt we believe we\u2019ve accrued to keep the buffer accounting for that?  Gregory Di Prisco: I would do it monthly, but I\u2019m lazy.    Sam M: There is a practical limit, as well. If we go below 100% collateralization, we may begin treading into a territory where we wont be able to gain anything on that. Therefore, there should be a practical set for lower limit. We can\u2019t just run it forever.  Primoz: Yes, I suggest we go month by month, but still do some monitoring between the months in order to see how the protocol behaves through supply and demand. We will have a better view of this over time. Personally, that\u2019s how I would do it.    Kurt: I\u2019ll emphasize again that as long as you keep the collective fees and the surplus buffer, or assert that you maintain enough surplus buffer to cover those unbacked fees, you are never actually in a situation where you\u2019re losing money because you can always liquidate, or otherwise sell, the vaults in some way. As long as you got the collected fees there and you haven\u2019t spent them, you\u2019re okay, and you can hold onto it with the hope that eventually DAI goes below a dollar. You can recover some portion of the value of those fees. An emergency shutdown isn\u2019t affected either as long as there\u2019s enough surplus buffer to cover the unbacked DAI, whereas there will still be dollar parity. Finally, yes, it does become a little bit of a thing to manage if you have to watch it closely.   Sam M: Regarding liquidations, though, if we were to turn those on, some inefficiencies would lead to an overall loss that\u2019s greater than the fees collected so far. That\u2019s supposing the price is stable.   Gregory Di Prisco: Yeah, but I would say there\u2019s no universe in which we should turn on these liquidations unless DAI is below a dollar.   Sam M: I agree.     Kurt: Even if you do turn on liquidations and DAI is below peg; it depends on whether you\u2019re going to use the current auction system or if you want to wait for the new auction system, which is probably going to be more efficient. I think you would get very close to the value of the collateral back if you did it carefully. As you said, there is a possibility for some inefficiency there. How big do we estimate that inefficiency to be and factor that into the risk discussion?   Matthew Rabinowitz: If you fast forward the video, let\u2019s say an entire calendar year to do a gross exaggeration if I understand it correctly, it\u2019s a declining return. We\u2019re capturing value today because of an RP that\u2019s associated with it, and over the time of one entire calendar year, if we got into that scenario, we would in effect be giving back those return where we wouldn\u2019t earn anything from it. We would have \u201cstability.\u201d DAI would be a proxy wrapper at that point for USDC, which would be the same as if we set the stability fee to zero percent if we were to wait an entire calendar year. Is that fair?   Sam M: If we waited an entire calendar year, the leading vaults would be at 97% collateralization with USDC-DAI, and that would lead to overall losses. I don\u2019t know, but we would have to get the price drop below 97 cents for those vaults to close themselves out; it would probably very likely go into liquidations at that point, in which case we\u2019re getting some loss due to auction efficiency. This is why I would say there should be a lower bound of approximately 100%, where we should turn off SF because they\u2019re no longer giving us anything. We might even take on losses in the long run.   Gregory Di Prisco: Wait, Sam, I don\u2019t understand that at all. If they\u2019re at 97 cents, but that extra three cents is sitting in the surplus buffer, we need to liquidate them at 97 cents. Why would we forgo the fees on all of the overcollateralized vaults to prevent that from happening?   Sam M: Sorry, when I said 97 cents, I meant 97% collateralization. If DAI returns to a dollar, they\u2019re still under-collateralized by three percent.   Gregory Di Prisco: Yeah, but we already collected that money; it\u2019s sitting in the surplus buffer. We only need to get those vaults out of the system at their current collateralization ratio.   Juan: Yes, but if those go to auction, there\u2019s going to be 3% in bad debt that\u2019s going to have to be\u2026   Kurt: Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d liquidate them that stupidly. We\u2019d set the peg to a lower value or use a different auction mechanism for them at that point. That\u2019s something we have control over as the DAO.   LongForWisdom: The three percent difference between the 100% CR and the 97 percent ratio is that it exists in the buffer, which is kind of what Greg is saying. Therefore, it\u2019s not lost; it\u2019s just in the buffer, and when the auction happens it then subtracts three percent from the buffer, which thereafter goes back to what was.   Sam M: Yeah, but that\u2019s a neutral operation. I don\u2019t understand why we would run stability fees past 100 percent collateralization.       Matthew Rabinowitz: The point is that if everybody were at 100%, then you\u2019re right. Some that will be at 100% and some at 102%. As an example, for the ones that are at 102, you would continue to charge a fee and either manually liquidate the ones that are at 100 or wait for them to lower. This is for when the blended number is below 100, but even then, the people above 100 are still generating value for the protocol.   Sam M: Yeah, sure, that\u2019s a fair point.   Kurt: Basically you could either come very close to breaking even or if you get the situation where DAI goes below 100, then you could get positive income.     LongForWisdom: Ok, we\u2019re getting a little late, so we\u2019re going to wrap up here. I feel like we\u2019re slowly converging on some shared understanding of how this works because we\u2019ve discussed throughout a couple of meetings. I\u2019d encourage everyone to join in on the forum threads and try and figure out what the various options are, and what the benefits and downsides to each option are. Once we have that figured out, we can then move towards figuring out options and getting an agreement on what we want to do. Thank you, everyone, for their points on this.

Welcome to MakerDAO scientific Governance and Risk meeting number 110, taking place on Thursday, September the 17th, at 16:00 UTC. My name is LongForWisdom, the Governance Facilitator for MakerDAO. I am joined by a bunch of people from Maker and things related. If anybody wants to speak, feel free to interrupt at any time.   Deeper discussions happen in the Forum.   PEG Management Emergency 01:46   We had an unscheduled executive on Monday in response to the peg deviation and emergency signal requests from the previous week. We saw a significant change in direction where we moved the LR down to 103% on USDC and PAX, which was executed shortly afterward.   We had more discussions on an on-chain poll, which closed on Thursday, to reduce the LR even further. It has succeeded at 101%. This is a more extreme version compared to the 103% we had on Monday.   Updates LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 03:13 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread   If you have the time to read over and vote in the active threads, that would be much appreciated.   I want to let everyone know that I am not sure how useful Governance at a Glance has been. If you are continuing to find it useful, please let me know because I might stop doing it.   Discussions   The Smart Contracts Team and Domain Work  Kurt_Barry from the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts team starts a discussion about the balancing of responsibilities and prioritization that the team needs to consider.    How much DAI is needed to get the peg back to 1:1  Mrabino1 posts an informal poll asking how much DAI is needed to restore the peg, which leads to a spirited discussion.    Working Group: RWA Onboarding  SebVentures starts a new working group to address the onboarding of real world assets with some interested community members and representatives from Centrifuge and 6s. If you want to join the working group, check out the forum thread above, and leave a comment.    Ongoing Initiatives   Collateral Calls - Calling all Projects!   Juanjuan sets up a signup thread for projects wishing to present on the bi-weekly collateral call. Know any potential collateral partners that want to present? Refer them here.   Juan: We had an exciting collateral meeting yesterday regarding real-world assets. We had both Matthew from 6S Capital and Lucas from Centrifuge presenting. Next Wednesday, on September the 23rd at 5:00 UTC, we will have Aave presenting their token and Gemini presenting GUSD.     Help Wanted! Scientific Governance and Risk Call Summaries  Davidutro is looking for additional people who would be interested to participate in the call summaries team who regularly produce high-quality summaries and shorter snippets of public MakerDAO calls.    Signal Requests   Should Urgent Action be Taken to modify the proposed TUSD Risk Parameters?  Jiecut presents a signal to adjust the TUSD risk parameters to reflect the recent move towards low LR stablecoin vaults.    Increase USDC-A Debt Ceiling  Aaron_Bartsch presents a signal to adjust the USDC-A debt ceiling to reflect the potential decrease to 101% LR on Friday.    Lucas Manuel Smart Contracts Team Update 06:47   We have continued to work on Liquidations 2.0. We also found out that the Kovan test-net will be deprecated soon. We are considering how to adjust our tooling to factor that in. In terms of collateral, the TUSD implementation has been upgraded. Therefore, we are going to whitelist that implementation in this Friday\u2019s executive.   We should also note that the \u201coffice-hours\u201d modifier will not be included in this week\u2019s executive.   Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 07:44   We have many proposals that are coming up for polling votes on Monday, September the 21st.   We have whitelisting open on the ETH-USD medianizer, whitelisting DDEX on the BTC-USD medianizer, whitelisting yEARN finance on the BTC Oracle Security Module. I will talk more about that one in a second, it is a little bit special. We have whitelisting Kyber on the ETH-USD Oracle medianizer. Lastly, we have an update to the ETH-USD Data Model regarding which sources do we use for ETH-USD.   To quickly touch on the yEARN finance proposal, they are trying to create a yBTC type of vault. This is very similar to the yETH that we spoke about a couple of calls ago. Essentially, it allows users to lock up their BTC, and it will try to generate the maximum yield possible. The maximum yield possible is calculated by locking up BTC and taking out a Dai loan and, after that, generating a yield using that Dai. The proceeds from that will then go toward buying more BTC. If we have room in the DC, it should generate another healthy chunk of Dai.   I have also submitted proposals last night for PAXG. I submitted the Oracle assessment for that and YFI, so do check out those if you get a chance.   Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 10:16   We started working on collateral evaluations for the October cycle. Currently working on Balancer, YFI, PAXG, and LEND. The good news is that we have community volunteers to make collateral evaluations, which will help speed up the process. We also made progress regarding our approach towards adding new rates. Hopefully, I will share more technical information within the week and get some feedback before the implementation of the new rates.   I also published a post on \u201cHelp Wanted.\u201d This is in addition to getting more collateral evaluators. We want to have more regularized domain members who can cover different things apart from collateral evaluations.   Also, we will soon publish some discussion points and proposed parameters regarding ETH-B vaults.   Charles St. Louis Weekly MIPs Update 12:13 This Week&#39;s Activity (September 14-18)1433\u00d7772 221 KB  All inclusion polls have passed. Today, LongForWisdom will do an inclusion poll review to confirm that these proposals can continue to the governance poll on Monday, September the 21st.  Next Week&#39;s Activity (September 21-25)1719\u00d7968 247 KB Collateral Onboarding Updates1721\u00d7967 237 KB   COMP, LINK, and LRC will proceed through the rest of the governance cycle.   It is uncertain whether ETH-B will be proposed this month but we will get more information from the Domain team in the future.   15 (25 is a typographical error) collateral types will go out for Greenlight Poll on Monday, September the 21st.   Collateral Status Index   Proposals in the RFC Phase1717\u00d7967 333 KB   A lot of these have the potential to be proposed for next month\u2019s governance cycle.   Jon Athmann and LongForWisdom are working on MIP14.   DC Adjustment proposal is still in progress.   MIP 20 will probably go into next month\u2019s governance cycle.   Two RWA proposals and a new proposal about Domain Structure and Roles.   Two sub-proposals related to RWA and Declaration of Intent will be ready for the following governance cycle.   Pre-MIP Discussions1724\u00d7968 176 KB Topics to look out for1720\u00d7969 210 KB  The Collateral Prioritization Framework is to be more transparent regarding why the team does things a certain way.  Discussion 1 17:39   Christopher Mooney: For the automatical DC adjustment module, I know that last time we proposed the MIP, it got shut down. I think it was more complicated than we thought; it included some additional functionality. It would be extremely time-saving for governance, users, and peg management if we all heavily considered that module. As long as it is configured well, it will automatically raise the DC within a predefined value. Please, everyone, check that out.   Charles St. Louis: From my understanding, this MIP got rejected due to recent uncertainty concerning the increase in the DC, and the solution for it was not completely fleshed out. The instant access module a lot of sense. Please, check out the discussion.   LongForWisdom: The first version of the MIP was not planned to be completely automated as well. It was up for the facilitators to work the appropriate increases. If the new version defines the instant access module, that would be awesome.     Derek: My aim during the next steps is to write a formal MIP with feedback that people have to help rework some of the parameters around the DC and buffer, and incorporate that into the formal MIP. Correct me if I am wrong, but I can present this to the community within the next several weeks so that it meets the deadline, correct?  LongForWisdom: Yes, the next deadline is October the 7th regarding the feedback requirements.    Brian McMichael: There are two things to configure, which are the amount (or percentage) that the line gets increased or decreased, and the ultimate ceiling, which will require another executive in order to raise if we hit. However, you can set that high enough to avoid having three executives a week for the DC requirements.   Segments Amy Jung Introduction to Community Development 22:07 Cover Slide1577\u00d7867 90.4 KB  Hello, I\u2019m Amy. If we haven\u2019t met yet, I used to be the program and operations lead in Community Development and have been passed the baton from Rich to be the new Head of Community Development. I\u2019m here to support this community in the next phase for Maker. This is going to be two years of work fit into one presentation. I apologize in advance if I will be moving quickly.  Bootstrapping the community1051\u00d7564 39 KB  Two years ago, Rich was looking to bootstrap the community around MakerDAO.  Ghosty1577\u00d7868 123 KB Structure of Community1278\u00d7704 44.9 KB   One framework to think about is what I call these rings and various segments being shown on the slide. We have different teams, and as the foundation dissolves, we will have new teams representing these mechanisms.   The larger ecosystem community user group may not be necessarily in the day-to-day weeds of the government community, but they are invested in the Maker system at large.   Comm Dev1276\u00d7701 49.4 KB  Community development helps with the growth and onboarding of the users and unitiated potential users into the Maker community.  Community Team1575\u00d7866 92.7 KB  We are a very unique team made up of both the community and the foundation.  Mandade1043\u00d7559 9.19 KB Mission1575\u00d7866 61 KB Comm-Dev Pillars1542\u00d7864 160 KB  We have not been very vocal regarding the programs and things we have been doing because we have been in the background focusing on developing them.  Components of Incubation1271\u00d7692 55.8 KB Educate1571\u00d7864 173 KB   Education is probably the biggest part. We are creating a lot of public goods that deliver a lot of information to the community.   I have a teaser - we are launching a new portal where anybody can get all their information about Maker.   Identify1574\u00d7865 110 KB  We have many teams working on various projects that we have been able to fund.  Onboard1575\u00d7863 158 KB   Onboarding is how we bring forward engaged contributors. It allows us to support them in introducing and developing their ideas.   On average, members stay with us for six months and work on several projects.   We have a variety of skillsets and ideas that we will continue to cultivate to uphold this diversity within Maker.   Incentivize1578\u00d7865 186 KB   We will be launching collateral onboarding grants (our largest grants to date) to help teams within the Maker ecosystem bootstrap their projects.   We had much success with bringing people together through meetups.   We have been experimenting with CDIPs, which is a simplified version of MIPs that allow anyone in the community to propose a project for funding under five-thousand Dai.   Another teaser is the badges, which we will update next week.   What&#39;s next?1574\u00d7865 32.3 KB Bootstrapping Community1575\u00d7865 83.6 KB   We will begin to see a stronger clarification between these two missions: how to support Domain teams and how to support Dai ecosystem adoption.   You can always join the community development channel or ping me @Amy.Jung on RocketChat.   LongForWisdom: That was an awesome presentation. I think we have seen in the past that there has been somewhat of a separation between comm-dev and governance. We are looking to try to bring these two groups together. This will become very important as we move towards a more decentralized DAO.   ",

                    "content": "Monet_Supply Vault Compensation Update 34:22   The Vault Compensation Plan Poll is live and ends on Tuesday, September 22nd.   Currently, it is kind of a hung vote.   45% support for 15% compensation.   43% support for 0% compensation.   11% support for 12% compensation.     If there\u2019s a hung vote, the default result is to scrap the current compensation plan, but still leave the possibility of another working group possibly forming or other community members leading this and choosing a different direction. That would be the result that happens if the poll was to end today.   It\u2019s ranked-choice, so for those voting 12%, consider voting for 15% or vice versa. Not trying to swing anyone\u2019s vote, but I am just bringing awareness for the options in ranked-choice voting.   If anyone has any questions, message me on Rocket Chat.   I would love one of the options to get more than 50% support.   Discussion 2   Christopher Mooney: Because it is a ranked-choice, it could not end in a hung vote, right? The algorithm would iterate until one of those options takes 51%.   Monet Supply: No, because people do not have to choose additional options. If someone bullet votes for 12%, for example, and did not choose 15% as their secondary option, the 15% vote would stay at 44%. This vote breakdown is what the results would look like if the poll were to end today.   Christopher Mooney: I did not realize that a ranked vote could have a dead end. I guess you are right.   Monet Supply: It usually would not. Due to the nature of this subject, I am assuming people have really strong opinions.     LongForWisdom: If we set it up where everyone needs to rank all options, it would work.  Andrew Burban: I did not realize that it was ranked-choice. I might go and change my vote.    Christopher Mooney: I will try to republicize it as much as I can. People may be more open to compromise as the deadline gets nearer. If no option gets 50%, the poll will default to oppose the vault compensation plan.   LongForWisdom: We require a majority vote because any option that succeeds here will have to go through multiple executive votes. I am not comfortable with having a non-majority vote go through executive due to the risk of it not passing.   Monet Supply: Yes, it is going to be frustrating for vault owners. Likely, it will not go through if it does not get the majority vote.   LongForWisdom: There is no way to eliminate the risk because there is a chance that people who have not voted in this poll will vote down on the executive. There is only so much we can do.     LongForWisdom This Week\u2019s Executive Vote 39:07   Last week, we had to quickly get a consensus to discuss various numbers that could go into the next vote. I apologize for having reacted strongly about the TUSD poll without realizing the updated implementation was not yet on-chain.   Primoz will give a brief overview of the options.   Primoz Kordez: Tomorrow, we might get an executive for a 101% LR for USDC and PAX. If we look at markets, the price is currently mostly 1.01 for most of the larger vendors. This is mostly on Uniswap but also on Curve. The price is already there and adapted due to public expectations. Our favor is that the yield farming has cooled down, and arbitrage is impossible, and Dai is being withdrawn, which has a direct positive impact on the price. So those USDC vaults that just unwinded directly impact the peg and predict that we are lowering the liquidation ratio.   If we measure how much more Dai is needed to push it below 101%, I think it is 50 million. However, imagine there is more Dai demand if some other farm gets released. Due to there being many other stable coins, there may not much as much demand on Dai. Nonetheless, if another farm comes, we need to have another 200 million DC increase at a minimum if we see more farms popping up to prevent a jump in Dai price and if there is another ETH crash to promote liquidity of Dai. It is up to governance if it is 200 million or more. If we increase that DC by 200 million or 300 million, is it really that much riskier? The USDC bump is already there, so increasing the DC will not change much.   Another thing that we need to discuss is, can we possibly diversify between these stable coins? We can limit USDC exposure by increasing the DC just a small amount such as 50 or 100 million, and force people to mint other stable coins by proposing a higher DC on those other coins as we slightly diversify the portfolio. This is something that we need to discuss. We have a bit of a problem because there is issues with TUSD smart contracts, which our Smart Contracts team will comment on. Then there is PAX, where there is no demand or utilization, and PAX is not used in DeFi. We cannot rely on PAX when you have some liquidations being triggered. You do not know if the keepers or vaults unwinding are going to be able to get a hold of PAX.   Another alternative is we could consider is raising the DC of USDC. In another week, when the peg cools down, we could decrease the DC on USDC, and then raising it on another stable coin like TUSD or PAX. You could rebalance your stable coin exposure based on demand volatility and which farm is getting hot. I am saying that there is a way to reallocate and diversify stable coin exposure when increasing the USDC DC.   Discussion 3   LongForWisdom: I will comment on the governance aspect of this. The Smart Contracts team is recommending one thing, Risk another, and Community another thing. It is hard to reconcile these things. The Smart Contracts team is recommending 10 million to start; correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Community resolved in 50 million, and Primoz discussed various strategies.   Brian McMichael: I do not think that the Smart Contracts team has a personal position. As far as technicals, it is no different than USDC or PAX.   LongForWisdom: Maybe that\u2019s something that we want to talk about more.     Brian McMichael: There is a forum post about the implementation to TUSD, which we reviewed. We don\u2019t have any major technical concerns besides one regarding compatibility with the V1 token, which would affect the users but not Maker and vaults.  Lucas Manuel: I agree with Brian. The contracts are technically sound. I\u2019m personally not a risk expert, so I can\u2019t speak to this in an educated way. The contract was made yesterday and has been in use for less than twenty-four hours. My personal recommendation on the forums is to start with ten million and raise that over time to meet demand. TUSD probably has the most transparent accounting out of all the stable coins. If their contracts are technically sound, I am happy to start with ten million, allowing the contracts to have some time under deployment and allow people to use it for a week.    S\u00e9bastian Derivaux: Can someone elaborate on what will happen if tomorrow USDC will change their implementation?   Brian McMichael: Essentially, everything would keep operating as it is right now. However, This could be a problem if the TUSD contract got updated to something that could perform a re-entrance and attack us. We face the risk with smart contracts, and interacting with these proxy upgrade tokens is one of them. Assuming it is a standard upgrade on their part and not manipulation of balances, it should not cause any problems as long as they stick with the ERC standard.   S\u00e9bastian Derivaux: Is there a USD stable coin that doesn\u2019t have non-degradable contracts?   Christopher Mooney: Dai. Does anybody want to say Dai?   Brian McMichael: Dai is not upgradable.     LongForWisdom: If anyone else wants to weight in on the DC? Given that the Smart Contracts team is split on the TUSD DC can we follow the community and go to 15 million?   Brian McMichael: This question should be forwarded to the Risk team.   Primoz: It\u2019s not a standard choice. It\u2019s related to smart contracts. It\u2019s not a financial risk. I propose to solve the peg, increase USDC-A on Friday, and then focus on relocating stable coins next week. If we decrease USDC-A DC and then increase other ones, there will be an arbitrage at 101%, which will result in the same outcome.     MakerMan: Looking at which stable coins we can capture, USDT is a big dog; the rest are 3B in total. We are cranking up USDT. The concern I have is that the Dai demand might be growing exponentially, and at some point, we will run out of collateral to liquidize Dai with one-to-one backing. I look at it from the risk perspective against Maker. MakerDAO market capitalization is floating at around 500 million, and our total outstanding is 600 million. 1-2% is not horrible, but what is the risk to the MKR holders, as well as the entire system? I\u2019m pointing out a warning that we might get ourselves into a liquidity trap that we cannot solve because there is no collateral to back up new Dai. I have concerns about taking more than 50% of these total markets unless we are looking at USDT.   Primoz: I don\u2019t think that is a worry if you hold a certain percentage of stable coin. If there\u2019s a demand for it as collateral, the supply will go up. But if you charge only 1% SF on such large exposure, you\u2019re possibly not properly compensating risk of a one in a hundred-year possibility that this will fail.   MakerMan: If you have to back it with TUSD, I get it. The question is if these assets are going to grow in a way to provide Dai liquidity, which is a maybe. I\u2019m just pointing out my concern that we\u2019ll get to a point where we don\u2019t have enough collateral to mint Dai.   Primoz: That\u2019s more of a systemic risk related to stable coins.   Brian McMichael: As long as the CR is 101% and there\u2019s space available in the DC, those assets will find their way to the Maker Protocol as long as there\u2019s an arbitrage available.   MakerMan: As they make their way into Maker collateral, you eat these things up, they\u2019re not going to be available unless more USD comes in to back it.   Christopher Mooney: You mean if we exhaust the capacity of all the stable coins on Ethereum in the medium term. In that case, we need to start RWA.   Brian McMichael: Right now, we are trying to balance out the curve pools, which we need to get to just to drive down the pressure of the price going up.   MakerMan: I am looking three months out instead of a week or two, and I just see demand growing so fast, I don\u2019t see RWA onboarding fast enough. I see Dai demand growing exponentially. It just doubled in the previous month, and I think it will double again next month.   Matthew Rabinowits: Challenge accepted.   Jon: And we still have Bitcoin. TBTC is coming out in the next several months. WBTC is growing exponentially. REN is doing very well. Furthermore, yETH is going to put on a Y token of that as well. I think in weeks or near months, there won\u2019t be a problem with more collateral.   MakerMan: I\u2019m seeing us eat up a lot of markets.   Christopher Moony: It\u2019s a hop skip and a jump to get BCH, zCash, and others as well.   MakerMan: We have a good problem. We need to be on our A-game, and the MKR value is currently not appreciating.     Sam MacPherson: Do we want to lower ETH-A DC?   Christopher Mooney: Isn\u2019t there an ETH-B alternative plan that will lower the DC?   Sam Macpherson: No, It\u2019s at 540 Million, and we\u2019re currently using approximately 66% of it.   Davidutro: I think that is good this way, personally.   Matthew Rabinowitz: The intent was to keep it low in case of yETH kicked up to have enough space. If they don\u2019t spin that strategy back up again, it will be wise to pull it back in.   Sam MacPherson: Are they planning?   Davidutro: They\u2019re waiting for Curve Governance changes. However, nothing has changed in terms of using MKR vaults underneath.   Sam MacPherson: Okay, let\u2019s wait then.   Primoz Kordez: They changed the parameter, which would increase the price on the curve that used to be artificially lower, and I think they want to proceed with the old strategy. That vote just recently passed.     Vishesh Choudry The State of the Peg 1:02:53 MCD System Stats MCD System Stats Alternative DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs Maker Vault Stats dai.descipher.io1088\u00d7449 222 KB  As everyone is aware, a week ago, ETH price fell and the Dai price was fluctuating but holding between $1.02 and $1.03 which coincided with an ETH rally four to five days ago. Dai\u2019s price also ran up, hitting $1.03 $1.04. It came down for a moment and then shot back up. Hitting $1.05 or $1.06 between the 13th to 15th. It has come back down since then.  VWAP1688\u00d7697 194 KB  There are stupid amount of trades made on Uniswap for the DAI-ETH pair.  DAI&lt;&gt;USDC1707\u00d7617 117 KB  DAI<>USDC: since the 9th or so, volume has split a little to where Curve was dominating and now with Swerve there has been a shakeup. That change-up will be an ongoing conversation.  DAI&lt;&gt;USD1111\u00d7435 153 KB  The DAI-USD pair has been a little more flat, with individual trades sliding in different directions.  DAI&lt;&gt;USDT1111\u00d7435 153 KB  DAI-USDT is echoing DAI-USDC  Dai Supply1008\u00d7106 20.2 KB   Supply is at almost 620 million.   350 million is from ETH, 3.3 million from BAT, 200 million from USDC, and 56 million from WBTC.   There are smaller amounts in other vault types.   1.2 million from PAX   Compound Supply909\u00d7488 78.9 KB  150 million in DSR. Much of that comes from Compound.  Balancer Pools854\u00d7498 96.9 KB   Looking at where that supply is going, there\u2019s about 60 million in the Balancer pool for Dai-ETH.   About 24 million DAI-SAFE.   15 million DAI-YFI.   Altogether, that\u2019s 60-70 million in Balancer pools.   Dai SAFE was at 160 million and 120 million a few days ago. A fair amount of liquidity drying up in the 13th to 15th date range, corresponding to the accelerated price run-up, which coincides with why that spike occurred.   This is the Dai roller-coaster we\u2019re on right now. Liquidity dries up for short term yields, then price spikes, then those yields end or expire. Upon expiry, there is a resurgence in liquidity, the price stabilizes, and the yield goes down.   It\u2019s repetitive spikes on those opportunities that crop up. It seems like, long term, we have this 1.01% floor that Dai doesn\u2019t go below for very long.   From there, it will jump based on attractive yields.   DAI USDC1032\u00d7494 36.8 KB  Dai from USDC supply has been a huge driver in growth. 110 million on the 15th, and in 2 days, 100 million more Dai minted from USDC. That is a significant number.  ETH Supply1709\u00d7806 87.9 KB  ETH has been flat for a while.  WBTC Supply1662\u00d7809 125 KB  WBTC had was some reduction in mints.  ETH Large Vaults1059\u00d7279 176 KB  For ETH, the same three or four vaults account for a large chunk of the ETH-DAI supply. A majority of that supply minted in the top of the distribution comes from the top ten vaults.  Liquidation Walls1013\u00d7357 47 KB   In terms of liquidation prices, there is a big wall at $280 ETH. That price drop would be a third of the DAI-ETH supply, which is the biggest wall to watch for. Of the largest vaults, ETH is also the highest priced volatile coin in terms of market risk.   There is a smaller wall at about $300 ETH.   Top USDC vaults1689\u00d7433 445 KB  Top two USDC vault users account for 42 and 36 million, respectively. With a few vaults in the teens trailing off from there in size. We\u2019ve seen historically the same; a few large users make large movements in that Dai supply.  Open Discussion Continued Peg Deviation 1:12:02  Vishesh: Literally, as we were talking about 6.4 million is minted from USDC-B.  Real-World Assets  Matthew Rabinowitz: To close off RWA: there is a forum post about prioritization that Lev put up. If we do believe that\u2019s critical, please, leave a comment. It will go for a vote soon, and if it doesn\u2019t pass, we\u2019d like to know how to add considerations before we pay for legal fees.

My name is LongForWisdom; I\u2019m the governance facilitator at MakerDAO. We\u2019ve got an agenda to go through. We\u2019ve got some weekly updates, and then we have a couple of segments about various things. We\u2019ve got Tim Black talking about the new community portal launch. We\u2019ve got SamM, who will speak about the Dai peg PSM (Peg Stability Module). And then we have Vishesh with our regular segment on the State of the Peg. So, generally, if you want to say something, please interrupt. We love to hear from you, so please don\u2019t worry about interrupting or hurting people\u2019s feelings.  Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum. Weekly Updates LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 01:08 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated.  I\u2019m continuing to work on governance parameter documentation. We also started looking in more detail at the DssGov proposed changes. We are trying to identify if any of the other proposed changes discussed in the wake of the flash loan instance the other week can be slot in there. I\u2019m having to talk to Chris and some of the other devs about that sometime soon. we had the MIP inclusion polls this week, finishing today. Haven\u2019t checked the outcome yet, but I\u2019m sure Charles will let us know later.  Discussions   A perspective of an off-chain senior position lender  Mrabino1 shares the perspective of an off-chain lender when working with MakerDAO. Matt Rabinowitz has been working on some RWA integration stuff talks about an off-chain senior position lender\u2019s perspective. He talks about his experience with MakerDAO governance and how it generalizes to other off-chain lenders. I thought it was a valuable perspective. I think people could benefit from reading it.    Governance Forget About Whales  Planet_X creates a write-up discussing some of the issues we\u2019re facing in governance and suggests some reasons that larger MKR Holders aren\u2019t voting.    Why choose Maker over Compound/Aave?  MKR1 re-opens the discussion on the Maker Protocol\u2019s advantages and disadvantages in relation to other DeFi lending protocols. This thread resurfaced concerns about why users might choose Maker over Compound, Aave, or other secondary lending platforms. It\u2019s sort of a discussion covering some of the differences such as risks and advantages.    Signal Requests   Accelerate the PSM Launch  Hexonaut opens a signal to accelerate the launch of the PSM (peg stability module) given recent feedback that DAI is losing market share in Latin America compared to USDC.    Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 04:08  Last week, we did the weekly executive. BAL-A and YFI-A are both now collaterals added to the system. Between the GSM delay of 72 hours and the office hours modifier that didn\u2019t happen until, I think, like an hour ago. Those are active now. Keep an eye out to see if their debt ceiling starts to get consumed. There were also some DC adjustments for various collaterals in that spell. We have collateral assessments up for Uniswap V2 LP tokens for USDC-F pair and DAI-F pair, so check the forums for those. GUSD-A is running in Kovan. Regarding some of the tooling for the executive spells, we\u2019ve been working on the DssGov executive in the final review. So that\u2019ll probably change some of the collateral onboarding documentation, which is also in the final review, so those two things are kind of dove-tailing together. There was no collateral onboarding priority sheet work done this week, so maybe we\u2019ll hit a normal cadence again in the coming weeks. There\u2019s a post that I\u2019m working on about the changes we\u2019re going to propose for flash loan solutions in DSChief. We\u2019re calling that DSChief 1.2 because this is the second upgrade. There was a bug in early 2019 that was part of the v1.1. That post will go out detailing the very minimal set of fixes that we need to prevent flash loans there and what the benefits of that are. It\u2019ll also walk through the migration steps so the details will be part of the migration, and we\u2019ll try and cover a timeline. Spoiler for that, the timeline looks like it\u2019ll be on Friday the 27th, which is Black Friday. We\u2019ll have an executive that will go live that\u2019ll put in the governance fix. It\u2019ll take some time to go through just like these collateral editions did but stay tuned to the forums to update that. SamM has resurrected the PSM totally on his own. I think some discussions around the peg had him resurrect this PSM idea, and he\u2019s got some code to accompany it. People probably want to pay attention to that. In ancient manuscripts, it\u2019s been said that sometimes the M in SamM stands for \u201cmachine,\u201d so thanks, Sam, for putting the work in. An update about personnel: Will Barnes is no longer with the foundation. He\u2019s one of the domain team actors for smart contracts. But the really good news is that he\u2019s going to be putting in a lot more hours for the DAO. Starting next week, it sounds like we may have him on MIP 21 collateral onboarding for real-world assets. We\u2019ll get another good engineer that\u2019s out working in the community. For the coming week, we\u2019ve got PAX-G going to Kovan. In this Friday\u2019s executive, I think we\u2019re going to have GUSD, and it looks like that\u2019ll make it in time. We\u2019re also going to try and do collateral assessments for Uniswap v2 WBTC-F pair, UNI-proper AAVE-proper, renBTC, and TBTC. And MIP 14, 17, and 25 are still in review; We just haven\u2019t gotten around to those yet. The foundation continues to work on the liquidations 2.0 roadmap. We\u2019re finished discussing stuff with auditors and reviewing the various auditors. We\u2019ll probably make our selections pretty soon. Then we continue to work on the DSChief 1.2 upgrade. There\u2019s a whole path where that\u2019s going to go out to Kovan. We\u2019ve got to test the upgrade and that process and work with UI and UX internally to do that.  Comments and Questions  LongForWisdom: Great, thank you, Chris. I did have one question. We saw, I believe, MIP 20 passed through the governance cycle successfully the other month. I\u2019m wondering what the timeline looks like for that in terms of actually writing the code?  Chris: Remind me again which one MIP 20 was? LongForWisdom: MIP 20 is the target price adjustment module from Lev, I think. Chris: Right, I guess we should just sort of craft that up, that wasn\u2019t really on my radar, but I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s too complicated, so yeah, we should build an executive that would deploy it, and we\u2019ll have to figure out where to slot it in. We\u2019ve got a lot of we got a lot of density before December. So, it may even be that we want to put it in January. Otherwise, we might have to bundle that with collateral onboarding. Nonetheless, we should get it ready to go. LongForWisdom: Cool, yeah, I think I haven\u2019t really communicated that with you recently. We need to start a list of things we\u2019ve approved that haven\u2019t been implemented yet. Chris: Yeah, and then we need a good calendar. I think we\u2019re getting to the point where we need some sort of tooling to track priorities. LongForWisdom: Yes, that\u2019s a good idea.   MakerMan: Actually, that was what I was going to comment on, Chris. It\u2019s just the mouthful that you gave of all the stuff you guys have been working on that I just want to say what a great job you guys are keeping up on all this and so great work that was all I had. But yeah, something I was going to suggest, which I haven\u2019t done a post on, is there\u2019s a lot of people doing a lot of stuff. It would be nice to have a place where you can see a running list of all the stuff everybody\u2019s done in the past. In one hive, they use it as a check-in but just so that when people in one place, they can see everything that\u2019s been done over the past three months or the coming three months.  Chris: Yeah, we\u2019ll have to talk about that. We use clubhouse internally at the foundation to track stuff, but we can use Github, kanban boards, and other stuff. We probably need to start to discuss exactly what we\u2019re going to do in the community, what the right tooling would be, what people would want. LongForWisdom: Yeah, I think I agree it\u2019s getting to the point where it\u2019s just a lot.   Nkunkel: Especially as we transition to this more DAO-centric model where there\u2019s more domain teams, in particular, domain teams that are external to the foundation, we\u2019re going to need a way to kind of keep track of activity, keep track of work, especially if people are getting paid by the protocol, you want to make sure that they\u2019re actually continuously delivering. I agree there definitely needs to be a lot more transparency in terms of what the domain teams are working on and when they complete and get stuff done. Amy: You guys are getting ahead of my update, which is the framework that we\u2019re working on. It\u2019s just a little bit more complicated to write in one forum post, which is why it\u2019s been taking long. There are many connecting factors, but essentially, the domain teams propose a budget and an introduction to something like objectives tied to a DAO roadmap. We haven\u2019t gotten to the tooling details, but I think just getting the mental model first is where we\u2019re shooting for.  LongForWisdom: Great, yeah, thanks, Amy, all right, let\u2019s continue the updates then.    Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 14:08  I think Chris has said everything for the most part. We\u2019re just rounding out what we expect to do before the end of the year and aligning on dates between all the domain teams on when we can deliver what. We hope to get a bunch of collateral onboarding assessments out next week. There\u2019s a public record that everyone can see the progress on regarding what we want to do through the end of the year. On the oracle side, I\u2019m finishing up on the Uniswap LP code. I\u2019m just waiting on a few more external reviews and some feedback to do one final iteration. We need to add a couple of administrative functions. Apart from that, it\u2019s looking like we\u2019re doing okay. In our staging environment, we haven\u2019t really found any issues. Again, from the oracle\u2019s perspective of the LP tokens, we\u2019ll suggest in the assessments that the debt ceilings should be artificially limited relative to what the risk team outputs for their parameters. This is until we get a professional audit done on the oracle code for the Uniswap LP tokens. Then as we get one or more than one audit done, we can then gradually raise the debt ceiling as we feel more comfortable with the code. From a personnel point of view, my team is very fortunate we procured the services of someone very near and dear to my heart, Marc-Andr\u00e9. Some of you may know him very well, and some of you are about to get to know him very well. He\u2019s going to join me on the Oracle Domain Team and be very visible and vocal in the community. I\u2019m excited. He\u2019s incredibly talented, so I\u2019m very excited for the DAO to get to know him and see what he can do.  Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 17:07  The renBTC risk assessment was published yesterday by our two external analysts, Andrej and Jernej. The parameters that were proposed are a bit conservative. I think they\u2019re actually quite appropriate based on the findings of the report. Both Andrej and Jernej are known community members for some time now. Many of you should know him. They\u2019re now moving on to the evaluation of tBTC. Hopefully, we onboard both renBTC and TBTC towards the end of this year and expect some demand there since we know how popular BTC vaults are. We also finalized the first UNI LP risk evaluation, which monetsupply did. To be more specific, the first evaluation was for USDC-ETH and UNI LP. Then we plan to make another one for DAI-ETH, which should be, of course, very different from USD. Then we\u2019ll do another one for redBTC and UNI LP. And finally, we\u2019ll probably publish all of them from our site towards the end of this month so we can onboard UNI LPs in December as agreed between the main teams. We are also lately looking into dust values mostly related to costs when unwinding vaults or bidding in auctions when gas prices increase. We think the 100 dust might not be an appropriate value, especially in times of distress and high gas prices. But there are some downsides to it because we might start excluding certain users. I plan to make a signal post about potentially increasing dust value, addressing all of these concerns, and sharing some data. On the RWA side of risk, the team covering RWA should soon release a risk assessment template, which is explicitly made for RWA. It\u2019s a different one that we use for crypto assets. A risk assessment for 6s is also more or less finished now and was made by Sebastian and is currently in an internal review phase. New Silver drop and ConsolFreight drop risk assessments are also in progress. These two are covered by Will and Phil. There\u2019s also an initial discussion for another potential RWA implementation proposed by UPRETS real estate, proposing a tokenized real estate collateral.  Amy Jung Operational Support Domain Update 20:21  On the ops side, as I mentioned, we\u2019re working on that framework to coordinate around the subset of work. This is kind of like a public roadmap and how to coordinate around that. This week\u2019s main thing has been how we can help domain teams form and propose their budgets. So it\u2019s been a lot of data crunching. There\u2019s a forum post coming soon, which is pretty exciting. There will also be an update on another working group that I\u2019m part of, which is autonomous MakerDAO. I\u2019ll drop the link in the chat, so we\u2019ll be giving an update on the forum as well, hopefully by next week.  Community Development Team Update 21:10  On the community side, there\u2019s sort of two main things:  We\u2019ve been working on leads with some senior contributors to define a fresh vision and community development objectives. These objectives will allow wider community members to engage deeper with MakerDAO and governance. I\u2019m super excited. I can\u2019t wait to share those with everybody. The other piece is a core project that this team has been working on for this year has officially launched. I\u2019m really excited and proud of the collaboration that went into this community-led portal. Tim will be giving you guys an update and a little running you through what that portal looks like.   Finally, a quick ask; There is a podcast forum thread call out. If you\u2019re able to participate in a poll that\u2019s specifically asking whether you think it\u2019d be a useful tool for us to have some kind of podcast version of governance communications.  Juan Collateral Call Update 22:35  Yesterday, we had another RWA edition call with Budd White from Paperchain. For those that don\u2019t know Paperchain, they\u2019re also with the Centrifuge. I guess they come after or in line, I would say, after New Silver and ConsoleFright. They do analytics on Spotify, Youtube, and other platforms. Because they can predict how much money these platforms are going to pay to the artist or labels, they can advance part of the revenue. So it\u2019s a really cool project for those that want to check out the talk is already on Youtube. The notes are coming soon. By the way, last year, they did a pilot with the Maker foundation. They already have some kind of traction. Next week, we will have Set Protocol, which are the creators of the token, Set, with Index Coop. Set Protocol is an asset management protocol in the DeFi space, and they created a DeFi Pulse index set. Many of you might already know about it. We will have them on November 18th at 6:00 PM UTC.

I think we\u2019re going to need the time later when we talk about the PSM stuff, so it\u2019s all good. All right, thanks for that. Like I said, if you are the author of one of those MIPs and want time to discuss it in more detail on this call, let me know, and put you in the first segment in the future. LongForWisdom: Cool, yeah, thanks. In terms of the inclusion review for the MIPs, I will confirm what Charles just said: all the inclusion polls passed and will be included in the MIPs bundle next week. The closest one was the Calendar Exceptions, but we\u2019re still five or four thousand ahead of \u201cNo,\u201d which puts it above the inclusion threshold.  Other Presentations and Updates Tim Black Community Development Portal Launch 29:15 3836\u00d72159 194 KB  Tim: I\u2019m here to talk about the community development portal. Technically speaking, the presentation is Shea Fitzpatrick, our designer who built this thing, including R\u00e9jon Taylor-Foster, myself, Amy, and 10 other contributors who worked since April or so.  3839\u00d72159 186 KB  Everybody probably has their own term for what a portal is. The community development portal is a hub for hosting programs and community-generated resources for improving the management, onboarding, and growth of MakerDAO.  3839\u00d72159 220 KB  You probably wonder who it is for. We\u2019re actually experimenting with audiences, but the portal mainly focuses on folks looking to actively participate in MakerDAO or its community programs. That usually falls into two buckets: people who are new with MakerDAO and want to learn about the system but may not be technically adept, and folks who are familiar with MakerDAO and are looking for canonical specific answers or ways to engage with the community.  3839\u00d72159 239 KB  Originally, we\u2019re on GitBooks and GitHub pages. We needed to migrate to something that was a little more fun, so we set out some objectives. We realized it wasn\u2019t just GitBook\u2019s constraints. We needed a platform that makes it friendly for contributors, content creators, and developers to collaborate. MakerDAO is global. Therefore, we had to solve localization right out of the gate, which I\u2019ll get into later. We wanted to make it visually appealing by supporting things like landing pages, specialized embed videos, callouts buttons, you know, the snazzy stuff.  3839\u00d72157 183 KB  The new portal was designed with a content-first approach. We approached a content designer who looked at what we had initially and then restructured everything together to be a digestible format.  3839\u00d72159 232 KB  This is a sort of spaghetti site map of everything we had, and there\u2019s sort of these three paths: a learn, contribute, and a funding path. The Learn path gives you explanations of concepts and further reading. Contribute allows becoming part of the community. And Funding or applying is for many of the programs we have under community development, whether hackathons, meet-ups, or larger grants. It\u2019s important to talk about how it\u2019s structured because we had to build the thing.  3839\u00d72159 156 KB  Meet R\u00e9jon, our resident mad scientist. He\u2019s @Maximum_Crash on Twitter. You can also add him on RocketChat. He\u2019s just R\u00e9jon there. He built Grants.makerdao.com for us and then jumped onto the portal project where he, as I mentioned, saw an outcry of concerns.  3839\u00d72159 260 KB  All the concerns are listed on this slide. I\u2019ll share the presentation, but basically, it was difficult to collaborate, coordinate, and style in a nutshell. Landing pages were hard to see. It goes on, and on where we had to solve some problems, so he built a solution.  3839\u00d72159 209 KB  The solution was a dream Git-based CMS, create low friction for creating new content and adding new features where content creators have complete control. There\u2019s a manageable skill ceiling for getting started, a little bit of a lift, but it\u2019s not too bad. We wanted to make the site way more controllable to make it look however you want, and we wanted to make content-portable. That\u2019s what this solution does.  3839\u00d72159 275 KB  There are some technical people here. This is what the stack is, and MakerMan asked if the stack is accessible? This is mostly one of those things that I\u2019d like to talk about later, but basically, the stack that we use has GitHub as the base, Gatsby, DAI.ui, MDX, and Lunr. Gatsby is great because it\u2019s geared exactly for the use case of where we were for collaboration. DAI.ui connects us to the foundation for brand identity, and it also has emotion.sh for some CSS in Javascript. MDX solves a huge problem for collaboration, and so it\u2019s sort of the bread and butter of every page. And Lunr is a static search index. R\u00e9jon built a custom translation module, which is pretty snazzy.  3839\u00d72159 292 KB  The stack solves a bunch of specific issues. It keeps GitHub as the source of truth for communication, collaboration, permissions, basically the entire history of the project. DAI.ui maintains the design bridge between the foundation and the community. Gatsby\u2019s graph QL API makes directory problems easier. If anybody has ever worked with GitBooks, you know a summary MD file way too well. MDC means that no one has to learn a new language. We were working entirely in Markdown. We have this extended format where you are actually more empowered as someone who makes a web page on our website.  3839\u00d72159 193 KB  So it\u2019s actually a secret sauce. R\u00e9jon\u2019s secret maximum crash plan is to create an architecture for a silent on-ramp to turn content creators into web developers. The more someone wants something out of a page, the more they become a front end developer. Writing content starts to become writing code; knowledge becomes power. That\u2019s his secret plan, and we\u2019ve done it with 10 people, and I\u2019m always happy to onboard new folks.  3839\u00d72159 214 KB  It\u2019s important to also talk about design. We asked Shea to establish a visual identity for community development stemming from the core Maker brand. But reflecting the distinct personality of community development is then applying that design language to the components that we have designed and then providing designs for home and landing pages. Basically, all of our contributors can be found in RocketChat. We\u2019re asking for more humanness for the community development universe.  3839\u00d72159 211 KB  Shea did this by user research. Shea just popped something into the community development channel, designed 3 themes, showed up at stand-ups, honed all of those, found another contributor to make characters and illustrations, and pursued the idea of simple, friendly, organized, and fun. This is the result.  3839\u00d72159 328 KB  This is some of their work in progress: light and dark mode, some of the buttons, and some of the little characters.  3839\u00d71961 210 KB  Now we have this actual landing page, which is pretty rad, with calls to action on everything. It takes us to these different sections on top that I mentioned before. I don\u2019t know what else to say besides check it out. We\u2019re always happy to have people come in and become a part of it. You can clone the repo at any time. It\u2019s just MakerDAO/community at GitHub. You can install the stack, and you can always hop into Community Development and share your feedback. We love bringing new people on board. So with that, I\u2019ll stop. We\u2019re going to share a link to this in the snippets today. You can always review this presentation as a place for links. If you have any questions, please come into community development and ask us! We\u2019d love to have you!  LongForWisdom: Perfect, it looks great. Looking forward to the next updates. Thanks, Tim.   Makerman: So I just wanted to reiterate, so my wife is visually disabled, and she\u2019d love to contribute somehow. I\u2019m curious as to how these models will eventually incorporate something like that.  Tim: Yeah, since it\u2019s all Git-based, it\u2019s really open to contributors, and we\u2019d love to make it more disability-friendly. My partner is deaf, so I\u2019m always thinking of disability readers and people who use websites in different ways, so we\u2019d love that contribution.   Makerman: Do you guys actually want a visually disabled person to come in and help to contribute? My wife would love to do some work, and it sounds like it\u2019d be fun.  Tim: Yeah, that sums it up very well. It would be, please.    SamM Dai peg and the PSM (Peg Stabilizaton Module) 38:50  At the beginning of this week, I wrote an implementation of the Peg Stability Module. I initially had the intention of going through the monthly governance cycle like normal. A few days later, I realized we may be able to kill many birds with one stone. We\u2019re continuing to have trouble with the DAI peg being at 1.01. Now it\u2019s pretty steadily there. It\u2019s better than it has been. But it\u2019s still not quite good enough, and so in my view, we\u2019re kind of in this worst of both worlds situation where we have massive stablecoin exposure, but DAI is still not at $1. I believe that we should take that final step whether our USDC exposure goes to 1,000 million-it\u2019s at about 500 million right now. If it goes up to 1,000 million, it\u2019s roughly the same. If USDC goes down, we\u2019re sunk either way. So we might as well solve the peg issues because we\u2019re hearing from users in Latin America and other integrators that they\u2019re abandoning DAI and going with USDC due to this volatility and peg issues. So the issue with going with the current solution and lowering USDC-A down to 100.1% collateralization ratio is that we\u2019re running into this problem before where there was this scenario of liquidations that we\u2019d have to eventually deal with. We also run into issues with timing and stuff like running the stability fee. We only collect up to about 100% collateralization. I think the PSM here is a really nice fit. It sort of solves all these problems at once, and that way, we can run the PSM with a 0.1% fee and gradually move it down so we can collect all the fees owed to the protocol. At the same time, we can bring the peg in line to within 0.999 to 1.001; The PSM will contain it to that degree. Essentially, this is a sort of short term stopgap. I don\u2019t view this as something that we should lean on in the long term. We should definitely be getting RWAs on board to get some sort of better supply in place. Still, for the time being, I think it makes sense to get the peg in line, get users using DAI, and we\u2019ll continue pushing for RWAs and farm tokens as we go. I\u2019ve made a proposal to accelerate the PSM launch. Basically, I propose not using the monthly process because that would mean we launch by the beginning of next year, which is too slow. I think we could do it by the end of the month-ish, and then we could get all the stablecoin vaults to switch over out of their own free will, as well as the leftover ones. We have some tricks to get those to bump over as well. We could probably avoid most liquidation issues, collect all the fees, and have a nice pool of DAI to USDC and other stablecoin liquidity. I think it\u2019s just a win-win-win. Any questions about that?  Discussion  LongForWisdom: Feel free to jump in with thoughts. When we had the PSM poll and the PSM poll, it ended up failing with 55% to 45% or something. That poll took subsequent to the Maker foundation saying they couldn\u2019t work on it potentially that\u2019s the reason why people decided to vote it down right. But that does mean this is potentially still a controversial issue. I know several people spoke out against the PSM previously. Would anyone who had spoken out against the PSM want to speak out now?  Lev: I would say that the points raised against the PSM at the time probably still stands today. I don\u2019t think much has changed in that regard. I believe The main change has been that we\u2019ve been running a policy that gives the stablecoin exposure in the form of a low liquidation ratio in USDC vaults. That\u2019s probably the biggest change since then. I also would like to add that PSM was being proposed as an emergency measure that would go through a very accelerated process at the time. Specifically, the question was about whether the PSM should be used as an emergency measure. Including myself, many peoples\u2019 objection to it was that it required further thought, and it wasn\u2019t completely obvious if that it should have been pushed through immediately. Sam: With regards to the emergency measure, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an emergency, but we should consider this within the next few weeks because, as we speak, the stablecoin vaults are all ticking down. Last I checked, they\u2019re at about 100.42% collateralization, and every 10 days, the tick down another 0.1%. So if we want people to naturally unwind their positions, we\u2019re going to need to go further with this sooner rather than later or shut off the stability fees or something.   Matt: I get the first-order thinking of why this is useful. Can you go through what would be the second order of thinking of how we get out of it? What sort of unintended consequences might show up when we try to unwind it or do we need to unwind it?  Sam: Basically, it\u2019s somewhat similar to the 101% liquidation ratio USDC-A vaults. The nice part is because it\u2019s pooling all the USDC, and it\u2019s open to the market at large as soon as we drop down below the lower end of the T-out parameter, so in this case, if we go with 0.1%, it would be 0.999. as soon as DAI drops trading below 0.999 against USDC, the market will arbitrage that out immediately. So we don\u2019t have this unwinding problem. As soon as we start getting excess supply again, it\u2019ll bottom out at 0.999, and we\u2019ll unwind the debt as fast as people are minting DAI basically. Does that answer your question? Matt: To an extent, I\u2019m more just concerned about unintended consequences if Ethereum hypothetically hit 5,000 tomorrow, and folks minted another 200 million DAI. Suppose we had a debt ceiling for that. Are there some other unintended consequences where if the DAI price then hit those numbers, then what happens if then with other scenarios. I don\u2019t have my head completely around it, not so I\u2019m just looking for insight from anybody? Sam: It would be an immediate buffer against supply shock in the very short term, but as we unwind the PSM, once it hits zero, we will have to go back to relying on stability fees and stuff like that to keep the price up.   Makerman: Hey guys, I\u2019ve been thinking about the peg a lot and the whole USDC thing. I\u2019ve had a lot of posts. I really wanted to be more prepared to talk about this because many issues factor here concerning the perception of DAI and risk and what you think about all of this. But when I looked at what\u2019s happening with the USDC vaults, as long as you have DC. You\u2019re willing to give up on fees somewhere like if we want to peg to USDC, you kinda don\u2019t care, really. What\u2019s the risk then? We\u2019ve already assumed the blacklisting risk. I made a post speaking about this whole PSM thing and how we think about this. We OSM these things to 1, and when you do that, if the real value moves around, let\u2019s say USDC goes to 0.985 even in this PSM the USDC your holding and giving DAI out at a higher value in USDC against the USD value. And so there\u2019s some hazard here I\u2019m trying to sort out, and I\u2019m writing an article on this, and it\u2019s leading me to other ideas that I think will be really good for Maker. It comes back to do we give up on the fees on this to get peg management, and I don\u2019t have the answer to that. I\u2019ve just been trying to work up the ideas. If I had any solution, I\u2019d say let us buy some time to figure out how to navigate out of it. Beyond that, we\u2019ve already assumed the risk hazards. Do we want to grow them or not before finding our way out, and do we want to push through with something that could have a little more thought? I\u2019m just trying to get the time together. This is a complicated issue to sort out and leads me to some interesting ideas that I want to reveal in forum posts. I just haven\u2019t gotten there yet. Nkunkel: We can always create a floating price. We can always create an oracle for the stablecoins. Right now, I just don\u2019t see a good reason to do so. I mean, it should be binary. Either there\u2019s money backing USDC, or there\u2019s not. So you either have the redeemability guarantee, or you don\u2019t. If we were to have a floating stablecoin price, people wouldn\u2019t be nearly as comfortable taking the amount of leverage that we\u2019re seeing. This could have a destabilizing effect on the peg. Right now, with very little money, you could get a ton of leverage and hammer the thing back down to $1.01. but you can only do that because of the confidence people have to not get liquidated, right? Now that\u2019s not exactly true because some people abandon their position afterward. They\u2019ve made their money on the initial sale and never look back, but that\u2019s a bit irrational, right? They\u2019re still retaining this put option on DAI that they otherwise in a floating world couldn\u2019t hold onto. So if the goal is to onboard more stablecoins to protect the peg, I don\u2019t see how adding an actual floating oracle for stablecoins would help. If our approach to fiat-backed stablecoins changes and we could protect the peg in other ways, then the situation changes, then we could take a look.  Sam: I view this as a temporary solution to retain users that we\u2019re losing in Latin America and integrators that were hearing again and again that they\u2019re abandoning DAI. It doesn\u2019t matter if we have the best, most decentralized stablecoin. If there are no users, that\u2019s a serious problem. This is not my ideal situation. I\u2019d rather have real-world assets, highly diversified, farm tokens, all these kinds of things. Still, for now, I think getting the peg in line is priority number 1.   Chris: Echoing what Sam just said; I think it was clear from last time that I\u2019m not such a huge fan of the PSM. I think it creates that empty shelf situation. We\u2019re talking about narrowing the band of the PSM at the empty shelves standpoint. But I also think at this point, the risk of losing users that don\u2019t care about the decentralization of DAI is probably worse. I think it\u2019s worth everyone looking through Lix\u2019s arguments. He does arbitrage around the DAI peg. We will remove the market for people who\u2019ll create vaults to mint DAI to take advantage of arbitrage, and maybe that\u2019s okay. And I wanted to add one other thing, which is the implementation that Sam is discussing. I think this might also make it where we could effectively take any liquidated positions we currently have in USDC-A and PAX-A, TUSD-A. We could take those once they got really close to that $1 mark before they were completely undercollateralized. I think we could actually sweep them into the PSM, which means that we could move them into the PSM rather than liquidating them. As a result, they\u2019d be available for the market whenever DAI price drops below $1. People will be able to pick it up. If we did that periodically, it would allow the existing USDC-A or other vaults to continue functioning and directly sweep things out. I have to think about that sort of fork of the vault over and whether that would mess up the PSM implementation, and that\u2019s it. I\u2019ve gotta go to another meeting. Brian: I just want to chime in. It was mentioned earlier that the foundation can\u2019t help out with this, which means that you don\u2019t benefit from the smart contacts team reviewing and auditing this code. I would strongly recommend that the)community seek out audits or find trusted people who can audit this code before rushing it into the system.  Sam: I second that. Nkunkel: The audit doesn\u2019t need to be free. The fees can come from the stability fee buffer. We do have the functionality to pull DAI out of there. We just need an auditor who will be willing to accept DAI or crypto or something. Frank: Yeah, but getting an audit right now is like a 2021 event, isn\u2019t everyone backed up? Nkunkel: There are always ways to cut the line, depending on who you know. Frank: Okay, good.   Sam: One thing I\u2019ll say about the code, though, from a security perspective, I\u2019m just finishing a bit of a rewrite of it, but basically, it\u2019s going to be exactly like a collateral type with a single permission vault, so it\u2019s really using existing systems. There\u2019s not a whole lot of risk. Definitely look at it. But on a scale from crazy risky new thing to not risky at all, I think it\u2019s a pretty tame addition without much risk, in my opinion.  MakerMan: It\u2019s basically a USD vault with an outlier of 100 and an upfront fee, right? Sam: Exactly.   Lev: I\u2019d like to mention another stablecoin related proposal that\u2019s coming shortly that I think has been discussed in some form before but the main idea is looking at ways to deploy Maker\u2019s current stablecoin exposure into farming and DeFi that would allow Maker to capture farming yields that have actually been the root cause of the overwhelming to be more fairly compensated for the stablecoin exposure that we\u2019re taking on and in addition to that potentially avoid using PSM or super low liquation ratio type mechanisms that have these unwinding barriers for that we\u2019ve been working on a collateral adapter that in theory is applicable to most DeFi farming mechanisms but particularly looking at proposing it for farming USDC on Compound and the reason for that is because it offers very attractive rate of return when you factor in the leverage that you can get from the USDC so in addition to that target the same asset we have most of our stablecoin exposure in, which is currently USDC. So essentially looking at trying to potentially swap out our current 1:1 USDC exposure to something like lets say 110% liquidation ratio that can collect a stability fee in a high single or low double digits while also offering attractive yield opportunities to the market. I\u2019ll put a link to the proposed implementation of this in the chat.  Sam: Yeah, I definitely second this, and this should be something we prioritize with the PSM as a fallback. This is the type of DAI supply that we want. Makerman: I wanted to say that I was analyzing this in conjunction with the peg, and we totally want to do this. It\u2019s a win-win in so many ways. Sam: Maybe you could speak Lev to the type of APR that can come from this and potentially the stability fees that we could charge for this? Lev: Yeah, I can quickly run through the numbers. If you go to Compound and you supply USDC, if you naively do that, you don\u2019t get an amazing yield. Do it in a more clever way, which you do by supplying USDC and by borrowing it again and resupplying it and borrowing it again. You will maximize your COMP yield without taking on any additional price risk. If you do that, you could probably earn upwards of 15% APY on the USDC. Let\u2019s say Maker supports a liquidation ratio of 110% for this collateral type from our perspective. Now, if on top of that you can put it into a Maker CDP, we\u2019re essentially taking on USDC exposure with a little bit of compound exposure. However, this is much more attractive to us. We don\u2019t have these super-low liquidation-ratio collateral types that are hard to actually offload and collect fees on, as we\u2019ve found. Suppose we have a 110% liquidation ratio. In that case, the user can get up to 11x leverage on compound USDC. They multiple their yield by 11x. We\u2019re also going to charge a stability fee. And let\u2019s say we charge an aggressive fee of 10%. We\u2019re assuming you can get 15% from the recycled COMP yield. Once we subtract those two out, you get about 5%, but then with the leverage from Maker, you can get 55% APY on this trade. The idea is that this is much higher than anything you could find in DeFi these days, and this is certainly a low-risk thing. We collect about 10% on this example, which is way more than we\u2019d usually make. We could collect a 10% stability fee for a year before worrying about how to liquidate it. That\u2019s the basic idea of the economics of this, which I think makes it very appealing. In this case, we\u2019re directly taking a piece of the farming action while generating loads of DAI.   Sam: And also, I believe this is another point. I think this would reduce the demand for DAI within Compound because USDC would become the dominant market, is that correct? Do you think that would happen?  Lev: Yes, that\u2019s correct, indeed. If you tilt the scale in favor of a different asset, I think it would almost certainly be because we would have this for USDC, for example, but not for DAI. Having this for Dai would not be as attractive for us because the DAI supply problem would not be solved. If we tilt the scales in favor of USDC, the DAI yield of Compound will go down relative to USDC.   Matt: I have the same question as Sam; what\u2019s the unintended consequence? What\u2019s the negative impact that this could cause?  Lev: Well, first, we have to consider what is the difference in risk profile. I think we have to consider the situation in relative terms compared to the alternatives. The alternative is the status quo or PSM, and so on. From the price perspective, we still have USDC exposure, so we\u2019re not risking our assets on the balance sheet. We have two new risks, one is obviously the technical risk, and the second risk is Compound\u2019s solvency risk. I think it\u2019s reasonable on the smart contract\u2019s side to mitigate these risks by starting with lower debts and improving the concept, getting third-party audits on this code. On the Compound exposure side, it\u2019s a more subtle question about the team and communities\u2019 attitude towards the risk. It\u2019s also worth noting that we don\u2019t know how Compound Governance will manage future rewards. We also don\u2019t know how compound governance would react to this specific integration. I don\u2019t think anything about this proposal is unprecedented. Sam: I think this is a pretty serious gamechanger, in my opinion. This concept of a specific USDC in Compound Vault can generalize to most farming situations or at least the lot. We could get these high leverage stablecoin farming with high stability fees in place wherever farming is available and permissionless and all that. I think this is pretty huge.   LongForWisdom: Maybe we should move on. This proposal sounds potentially awesome.  Vishesh Choudry The State of the Peg MCD System Stats MCD System Stats Alt DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs Maker Vault Stats 01:11:00  To summarize, we\u2019re sitting at about 990 to 993 million total DAI issued. Still, about 378 million of that is from ETH. Then you\u2019ve got a solid 1.2 million from ETH-B, about three million from BAT-A, 411 million from USDC-A, 109 million from WBTC-A, 57 million from TUSD-A, smaller amounts from ZRX and MANA, 21 million from PAX-A, smaller amounts from USDT-A, COMP-A, LRC-A and then 5.1 million from LINK-A.  1254\u00d7716 135 KB 1266\u00d7724 143 KB 1264\u00d7730 147 KB 1256\u00d7718 143 KB 1260\u00d7678 127 KB  In terms of where we are with the DAI peg, lately, it has been trading pretty consistently around $1.01, with some volatility in the last week or so. Both above and below peg are both above and below the equilibrium price right now.  1296\u00d7744 138 KB  A lot of those trades have been occurring on Uniswap V2. We\u2019ve seen that kind of dominate the share of volume lately. Then there are some trades and dYdX that stay centered around the median point of those trades.  1270\u00d7726 106 KB  Right now, what we\u2019ve seen is moments where large trades will experience slippage on Uniswap but in both directions. So that\u2019s where you see this bias for some of the larger circles above and below the line, and you see a pretty tight grouping of smaller circles right on the line. There was some fluctuation with large movements in ETH and other asset prices in DeFi, but by and large, it did hold pretty consistently steady.  1270\u00d7748 135 KB  In terms of some of these vaults for USDC-A, it\u2019s the largest bucket. We have a debt ceiling of 485 million on that right now, with 411 million issued. As you can see, the largest chunk of this 272 million is pretty much smackdown 100% collateralized. Then 116 million is collateralized at 101% or higher. And smaller amounts at higher collateralization ratios. If we look at the amount of projected DAI that would be liquidated at a price of a dollar, that\u2019s basically everything that\u2019s currently able to be liquidated. If liquidations were enabled, that\u2019s about 380 million DAI, so basically the majority chunk of the USDC-A portfolio. You can see the largest few positions have not really been touched since September. Those are sitting there, so basically, the 40 million vaults have been sitting, and then we\u2019ve got the fourth largest vault at 22 million that was touched in the last two days. That one is sitting at a 101% collateralization ratio. So this is basically the trend you see. The ones that have been updated more recently by the vault owner tend to be the ones that have a slightly higher collateralization ratio, which makes a lot of sense because basically, the collateralization of these vault positions has been decaying primarily due to just accrual of fees.  1258\u00d7698 191 KB  From a USDC trade standpoint, the peg basically echoes what\u2019s been going on with the implied ETH-DAI price and then same with the USD peg with a bit more volatility and then again DAI-USDT looking a lot like DAI-USDC but with lighter volumes.  1264\u00d7658 85.3 KB 1252\u00d7682 79 KB  You can see the largest bucket of collateralization being 77 million of that DAI is 220% collateralized. Some of the individual larger vault positions are 270% to 280% collateralized with the collective 100 million or so in that 20 percentage point range. So, by and large, the ETH portfolio positions are a bit more collateralized, which can be attributed, I think, primarily due to the nominal increase in ETH-USD value. However, some of these vaults are updated a bit more regularly. The largest position was touched a day ago. The smaller positions there basically last week, so these positions tend to stay a bit more current. There is a nice distribution to the collateralization ratios amongst the vaults. It\u2019s not like the entire ETH-DAI portfolio is grouped into two or three large vaults, which is good. That distribution tends to keep the debt portfolio and that collateral asset a bit more fresh.  1264\u00d7734 130 KB  Another huge chunk of the DAI portfolio is wBTC. So what we see basically is the vast majority of the wBTC positions are 190% collateralized, which is a bit less. Still, again there\u2019s that discussion around is the wBTC really that much more market volatile. I think the consensus is no. Basically, you have an 85 million liquidation wall there at an 11.9k price. Then 84 million or so. Actually, if you expand this to the top three, 90-93 million of that is living in the largest three vault positions, which are 190, 190, and 280% collateralized, respectively. That, I think, a pretty solid collateralization ratio for those three largest wBTC positions.  1272\u00d7622 89.2 KB  Another large component of the portfolio is PAX-A, with 21 million, which basically lives in the three largest vaults. You can see that almost the entire portfolio is collateralized between a 100 and 101% collateralization ratio. This is a very similar scenario to the USDC positions. You kind of see a meme in the PAX vaults at around 100.6% in terms of averages. The USDC positions decayed to around 100.4-100.5% collateralization, so that clock continues to tick.  1252\u00d7672 104 KB  In terms of where a lot of that DAI is living. We touch on the basically 360 million in Compound, 200 million in Uniswap pool, and another 32 million in one of the largest Curve pools. There are some farming pools. Barnbridge and the YFII pools, which contain smaller amounts of around 20 million apiece. Then the AAVE pools around 17 million. These Curve positions are fragmented a bit into multiple pools. Basically, as we touched on last week, you have at least six to seven hundred million of the DAI outstanding in liquidity pools or farming opportunities. I think the community pretty much is aware that that\u2019s kind of the current state of the DAI portfolio.  1260\u00d7632 94.9 KB  Overall, the outstanding amount of DAI did tick up slightly, so you could see this very shortly across the mean mark. It kind of depends on what happens with the stablecoin vaults.  Open Discussion 01:21:49  LongForWisdom: Any Questions before we close off? We will skip the call on Thanksgiving due to the holiday. We\u2019ll leave it there if anyone wants to share any final points or reminders they want to share before we close up?  Juan: Allow me to end on a positive note regarding something that SamM said about projects not accepting DAI because of the out of peg situation. I don\u2019t entirely agree with the statement that the peg is out of control. I think it\u2019s within a range and maybe coming from Argentina, I would say that if the DAI is worth more then the dollar, it\u2019s because it\u2019s more valuable than the dollar. I\u2019m not saying that we should stop doing things to maintain the peg. I think that all these tools are great and we should definitely consider them and work on them. Still, I don\u2019t know if I agree with the statement that these projects are not taking DAI because of that and whatnot, but I wanted to finish on a more positive note. I don\u2019t know if I managed to convey that.   LongForWisdom: Okay, thanks. We\u2019ll leave it there. The discussion should continue in the forum about the PSM. Let\u2019s wrap up here then. See you all next week, and thanks for coming!

My name is LongForWisdom; I am the governance facilitator at MakerDAO. Please feel free if you want to interrupt or ask questions in terms of the usual preamble. We\u2019d like you to get involved. Thank you to everyone for joining. I\u2019ll briefly go through the agenda. We\u2019re gonna have the regular weekly updates and the MIPs governance poll review. We\u2019ve got a couple of Nik and Charles segments talking about liquidations and useful LP tokens. Charles is going to talk a bit about the collateral onboarding handbook. Before I dive into the governance update specifically, there are some questions about this meeting itself. A couple of people asked if we want to consider moving the meeting time to be one hour later to 17:00 rather than 16:00. Also, I think Matt Rabinowitz proposed leaving the meeting open after the official recording time so that people can just discuss in a more informal setting. I\u2019m currently considering both options. There is a poll on the forum, which I will link in the chat right now. I\u2019d appreciate it if people in this meeting could vote in those to give me some idea of what they are thinking. I think we\u2019ll discuss this more next week after seeing the poll results, but I would appreciate that.  Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum. Weekly Updates LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 02:22 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated.  This week, Derek and a couple of others have noticed that something\u2019s behaving a little bit strange with the Governance Polls. We\u2019re not considering the polls to have been decided yet. The UI is potentially incorrect. Therefore, we\u2019ll be posting on the forum with the results once we know what\u2019s going on and hopefully fix these UI issues.  Discussions   PSM, Flashmint, MKR tokenomics and MakerDAO security  Homo_Economicus asks some questions about the future of MKR Tokenomics, which prompts lively discussion. We had a cool discussion, a couple of comments and questions talking about the future of Maker economics, which prompted a lively discussion around the topic. This is obviously something people think about a lot, which is cool.    [Gov Poll] Vote for 0% for the Stablecoin Stability Fee!  cyrus of Former Risk Team fame argues favoring reducing the stablecoin stability fee given the recent discussions around stablecoin vaults.    Small Vaults Liquidations & Incentives  charlesstlouis posts a discussion about the risks and details around setting the dust parameter on behalf of the Maker Foundation in response to the post by yaronvel from the protocol.    Signal Requests   Accelerate the PSM Launch  hexonaut opens a signal to accelerate the launch of the PSM (peg stability module) given recent feedback that DAI is losing market share in Latin America compared to USDC. This signal ends Friday, November 20th. If you haven\u2019t voted on that, I will encourage you to do so. 68 people have voted so far. It\u2019s been a pretty good turnout. I seem to be mostly positive at this stage.    Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 04:42  I\u2019ll begin by talking about last week. We had the executive for GUSD-A, which did pass. That\u2019s subject to the 72-hour governance delay, which will happen, I think, on Monday. Even if the portal will tell you that it\u2019ll execute sooner, it has office hours modifiers. So, don\u2019t freak out or change your tooling until Monday. There\u2019s polling happening for the monthly executive. UNI and AAVE have collateral assessments, which are in review by me. However, they are totally blocked on me reviewing them. Thanks, Naz, for doing that; that\u2019s awesome. As far as PAXG, we were going to put it in this week\u2019s executive. When we were implementing it, PAXG charged a fee on transfer. Therefore anytime the transfer run call is made, there\u2019s a fee that\u2019s applied. Our DssGov proxy actions work to call the joint adapter. This would mean there is a fee in the join adapter when joining and exiting. The proxy actions also hop the ERC-20 through it, which means that there would be a double-fee on inserting PAXG into our system. For what it\u2019s worth, this double-fee would apply to Tether as well if Tether were to turn on their fees. We\u2019re trying to develop a solution that would work for people who charge fees on transfer. Unfortunately, that means that PAXG will not make the cut for 2020. We\u2019re going to put it off until 2021, but more on that probably in January. The DssGov.Exec library is still in review. There\u2019s a lot to that, but it\u2019ll make spellcrafting much easier. I\u2019m sure all the collateral onboarding teams are going to be psyched about that. There\u2019s no work on the collateral onboarding sheet, but the documentation is complete and has been posted. I believe there\u2019ll be more on that later, which is great news. The Domain Team posted a tentative schedule of what we think is going to happen into year-end. Thank you, Long. It turns out I can\u2019t edit it, so I don\u2019t know if I need permissions in the forums. It keeps telling me I don\u2019t have permission to edit that.  LongForWisdom: Okay, let me fix that.   We\u2019re going to try and make that a living post until the end of the year and update it as we go. This is a very \u2018aggressive\u2019 schedule, and we will be implementing a happy path on everything. We think this is what we\u2019ll be able to pull off with that happy path. However, any randomizations, reprioritizations, or \u201cgotcha\u2019s\u201d with any of that may result in us to be highly discriminatory and just knock those right out until 2021. Check the schedule out. If you have any questions, feel free to post them there. Governance will probably have to decide between the Flash Mint Module and the PSM for December 18th. That\u2019s probably going to come up as something that we\u2019ll need to signal for and vote on. I made a post about fixing the governance Flash Loan. There\u2019s a more extended video of the history behind the flash loan fix and what we\u2019re doing for it. If you missed that, it\u2019s about a 30-minute discussion in the community call which I was on this week. I started putting the collateral onboarding updates in the forums. There\u2019s an announcement channel in RocketChat. That will be linking out to this forum\u2019s post. So, anybody who needs to use these things before they go live and put them in code will find the details, contract addresses, and whatnot in there. Sam has continued to work on the PSM. In the coming weeks, we have the executive bundle. I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll get rolled up later. I know the polling\u2019s not finished. Therefore, I\u2019ll probably end up talking about this later. Still, we\u2019re gonna end up pushing DsChief 1.2 out to Kovan, which I\u2019ll discuss later. Friday\u2019s executive will include polling results. We have assessment work for UNI and AAVE, which are in the final review. We\u2019re still planning on doing renBTC, tBTC, and the UNI-V2-wBTCF LP token. Those are all going to have to happen by the 17th, according to the schedule. You can expect them next week. As for outstanding Domain Team reviews, we still have MIPs 14, 17, 25, 29, and 30. These are the DAI protocol transfer, the weekly debt ceiling adjustments and risk adjustments, flash mint module, PSM, and farmable cUSDC adapter, respectively. Regarding the Foundation Team, I\u2019ll say the auditors for Liquidation 2.0 are chosen. However, we\u2019re still working on some of the finalized details. Therefore, we\u2019re not going to announce who they are just yet. We may announce that next week as we have more info. Finally, DsChief 1.2 work continues, so I\u2019ll talk about that later when we get to that segment.  Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 11:22  Last week, we had done Kovan deployments for oracles with PAXG, UNI, and AAVE. We\u2019re basically on track to get those in before the end of the year except for PAXG based on Mooney\u2019s comments. We\u2019re also going to do the oracle assessments this weekend or possibly early next week for the three mentioned as well as renBTC and tBTC. So expect those two to come out pretty soon. For renBTC and tBTC, likely, we\u2019ll just recommend using the existing wBTC oracle rather than creating anything custom. It\u2019s just a matter of where they\u2019re traded and coming up with a robust data model. When the volume is lopsided, it is a little bit challenging. What we are doing would be the safest method. RenBTC is a little bit more complicated because they have a mechanism for minting and potentially burning. The idea is that even if the fundamental price for renBTC would be slightly adrift from Bitcoin due to these fees, it\u2019s almost negligible from a percentage standpoint. That means that the collateralization ratio rate has a much higher relevance regarding how much debt you can take out and whether you should be liquidated. Hence, it\u2019s actually quite feasible to just use the regular wBTC oracle in that case. We\u2019re in the final testing stages for the Uniswap V2 LP oracle contracts. The other thing I\u2019m looking into right now is whether we can use them for  SushiSwap because SushiSwap should be a fork in my mind. I\u2019m not sure how many changes they\u2019ve made since they launched, but I\u2019ll have to investigate that. We\u2019ll likely be able to get the SushiSwap LP pairs for free as well, which would be appealing because the yields on those for certain pairs will be higher given that they\u2019ve turned on the incentives for a few different pairs. SushiSwap is more competitive in some pairs. Uniswap is more competitive in other pairs. This means that what you use determines the best price and the majority of the volume for each of those pairs\u2014this way, the fees tend to be better. I\u2019m not sure if we have any greenlit polls for any of the SushiSwap LP tokens. Once we get the Uniswap LP tokens out, the community should start looking into the other ones.  LongForWisdom: Cool, thanks. I think I need to say that I noticed the whitelisting proposal for Yearn Finance on the YFI-USD Oracle on the forum earlier as well. Nik: Yeah, that came in yesterday. That\u2019s for a YFI vault that they\u2019re creating. LongForWisdom: Cool.   Chris: You see that they\u2019re also backporting our Chief Flash Loan fix into their Vaults?  Nik: I did not. Chris: I\u2019ll find that here.   Frank Cruz: Hey there, Nik. Quick question. About 24 hours ago, we had IndexCoop, and the SetProtocol guys hosted in the meeting with Juan. One of the things that came up during that call concerned the oracle and planning on using it. I believe it\u2019s going to be the most popular one on DeFi. You know which one I\u2019m talking about? However, they said they were open to working with whatever we, Maker, and the community wants to use. So, my question is, when we see a MIP6 as a community, should we start telling these protocols, \u2018these are the oracle expectations?\u2019 How should we approach that?  Nik: Sure. In terms of what another protocol uses, they\u2019re free to use whatever oracles they want in their system. For our system, I don\u2019t think we should be allowing anyone to use any other oracle besides ours. It\u2019s just way too risky to basically have a dependency on an external protocol. From a cost perspective, we don\u2019t want anyone turning up the wick on us later. And from a financial perspective, it\u2019s not even a good idea to have the dependencies. If they\u2019re writing MIP6\u2019s and say that for the oracle side of things, they are using ChainLink or something like that, the answer is just straight up no. They have to use our oracle. They won\u2019t be paying for any of that stuff; it\u2019s covered by the DAO because it thinks that the stability fees generated will outweigh the costs of maintaining that oracle.   Frank: Got it. Yeah, I think it was a question of DPI, the DeFi pulse. It catches pricing from Maker, YFI, and Balancer. It\u2019s been a little challenging for them.  Nik: I\u2019ve been talking to Felix about that one regarding the best way to do it. There are a couple different ways. One way is from an off-chain perspective where you just pull all the index components\u2019 prices and get the appropriate weightings. The feeds in their off-chain clients come up with a number, and then they push that number to the oracles. The other way to do it is through our custom oracle smart contract, which contains the weightings. You can pull the weightings from the external contract\u2013maybe just has them in storage\u2013and then there\u2019s a function anyone can call to update those weightings. You link the prices to on-chain existing oracles that we have for all of the index components. Now, where this gets tricky for both of these methods is when the index updates; Whenever an asset is added or removed to the index, we would have to make changes on our end to support that change. There needs to be some kind of implicit agreement with the DPI community or whoever is controlling this. Whether they want to make changes, there needs to be a six to eight week lead time. This problem isn\u2019t unique to Maker. Everyone who integrates DPI in terms of any kind of finance-related thing where you need a price oracle will run into this problem. I think it\u2019s not an unreasonable request. I believe it\u2019s something that they\u2019re just going to need across the board. This is only one of those unique little scenarios you have when dealing with an index that can change over time.   Juan: They did mention that, Nik. I don\u2019t want to go too much into detail. However, they did mention rebalancing when the supply changed in addition to adding or removing assets. So, that\u2019s something to consider. The lead times were touched upon, as well.  Nik: Okay, I\u2019ll definitely take a look at the call if it\u2019s recorded. Juan: It is.    Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 21:57  Chris had already mentioned that he made a post on the forums which explains what\u2019s on the agenda until the end of this year. On the risk side, we should meet all the deadlines apart from the tBTC evaluation. I think this shouldn\u2019t hurt us too much since the debt ceiling would likely be very small for tBTC, at least initially; We\u2019ll see about that. This means that this and next week, we will be focused on finalizing the AAVE and Uniswap evaluations so they could get onboarded in early December. RenBTC has been complete, which means it could get onboarded together with AAVE and UNI. This is assuming, of course, that other teams will have everything ready. After this, our goal is to finalize all three Uni LPs, of which two of them are already done. This would mean we should post evaluations until the 4th of December and then onboard Uni LPs until, I think, the 18th of December. In the first week of December, we also want to have new parameters ready for the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module, MIP27. This module should help us a lot during the Christmas holidays when we won\u2019t have regular votes. If debt ceilings are hit, this module could help us a lot by automatically increasing ceilings. We\u2019re still debating whether this module should be applied to all collateral types. I personally think it may not fit well with stablecoins since we would always want to have enough debt ceiling available in a short time in case we have a potential liquidity crunch in liquidation events or just a high DAI demand. On the Real-World Asset side, Sebastian published a post yesterday on the forums highlighting that things are moving ahead pretty well. It also included the difficulties we face by onboarding this kind of asset, which we\u2019re not used to. However, the plan is to publish the final risk evaluations for 6S, ConsolFreight, and New Silver Drop tokens in early December.  Amy Jung Operational Support Update 24:50  We\u2019ve been pretty heads down. We\u2019re working with Rune on a framework and some MIPs to create objectives for developing a roadmap, onboarding budgets, and defining facilitator pay and incentives. I\u2019m super excited about how that\u2019s shaping. It\u2019s a long process because it is, as I mentioned, pretty complicated. However, in reality, the framework itself is really simple. It\u2019s just that writing the MIPs takes a while. Secondly, I\u2019ve been playing a contributor role in some initiatives. For example, Autonomous MakerDAO. Check out that forum post. It describes all the awesome things happening in the two months since the working group has been formed.  Community Development Team Update  On the community development side, we have had five meetup applications. There\u2019s still a steady stream of meetups that are happening despite Covid. I\u2019ve been focused on the grants as well. We are narrowing down on the candidate for the Kleros and Maker fellowship for that legal assessment of collateral, focusing on the legal assessments. Also, then a new grants platform is going to be launching next week. I\u2019m super excited because it\u2019s a whole platform that anyone could submit proposals. Anyone could view proposals in motion. You can see where the proposals are in terms of their milestones and status. While transitioning to that new platform, I\u2019ve been reviewing and onboarding new grants as they come. On that end, we are hiring a Grants Operations Manager to work with me. This person would eventually probably work for DAO grants as well. If you guys know anyone, recommendations are very much appreciated.  Juan Collateral Call Update 27:40  Yesterday, we had a call with the DPI, which is the DeFi pulse index. They are working with SetProtocol to build an index of the DeFi projects out there. They mimic, I believe, the top 11 projects and Maker is there. That was yesterday, and it\u2019s already on YouTube.  People should be working on the notes to make it more clear over the forum; that\u2019s coming soon. Next week, we\u2019re going to have Blocksquare, which is another Real-World Asset call. That\u2019s on November 25th at 6:00 PM UTC. the week after that, we\u2019re going to have Leverj. They focus on leveraged positions on smart contracts, which is on December 2nd at 6:00 PM UTC. The last one is Melon on December 9th at 6:00 PM UTC. We are trying to get a special edition thing at a different time with UPRETS real estate for another Real-World-Assets call. However, they want to have it during a Beijing time zone. So, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re still trying to find the best time to maximize the audience. We\u2019ll get back to you on those. Regarding collateral onboarding, Charles posted last week the collateral onboarding handbook. It\u2019s really cool. I urge everyone that wants to learn more about the process and hopefully help on this to go and take a look. I wanted to mention that tomorrow I\u2019m going to have a call with Sam McPherson or @hexonaut. We\u2019re going to do a pilot on this initiative called \u2018Know Your MIP.\u2019 He\u2019s going to explain a little bit more about MIP 29, which is the peg stability module. His recent signal requests to accelerate this if the community likes it. The reaction has been good, and we might do this with other MIPs as well. The agenda is already on the forum. It\u2019s tomorrow at 5:30 PM UTC. Finally, I wanted to say that we have created a POAP badge for Maker contributors for Q3. The Q4 is coming soon. For those that have contributed to Maker in Q3, there\u2019s the forum post where you can fill out a form and get your badge.  Charles St. Louis MIPs Update 31:29  I\u2019m just going to paste the written update in the chat before I start the presentation, so everyone can reference it.  1526\u00d7846 158 KB 1520\u00d7840 175 KB  The Governance Poll Review to confirm the poll\u2019s outcomes won\u2019t happen on the upcoming Thursday due to the Calendar Exceptions MIP proposal. Just for further context, it\u2019s Thanksgiving.  1506\u00d7850 122 KB  We had a couple of new MIP proposals enter the RFC phase. MIP29, the Peg Stability Module by SamM and the MIP30: Farmable cUSDC adapter (CropJoin) by Lev and Rain.  1524\u00d7856 174 KB  A few new pre-MIP discussions have been going on. The most recent was the real estate tokenization protocol. Another one was a pre-MIP discussion on the incentives to align the interests of Maker Domain Teams with the MKR holders. Lastly, some ideas on DAI PEG USDC-A vault fees providing analysis and suggestions for people to consider and its ongoing discussions that are still having quite a bit of activity.  1524\u00d7848 169 KB Procedural LongForWisdom November MIPs Governance Poll Review 36:34  LongForWisdom: All right, thanks, Charles. I think, as Charles just mentioned, given the confusion around the polls, we\u2019re going to hold off saying that the executive is definitely going to be on Monday. This is until we have the results confirmed by Derek. I\u2019ll include that in the post when I do the update on the other polls. As Charles said, I fully expect it to go ahead; I just want to make sure to say it definitely will.  ",

                    "content": " Other Presentations and Updates  Nik Kunkel  Liquidations and Uniswap LP Tokens 37:22  I was just gonna talk about it, but now I\u2019m kind of feeling like I should have made a presentation. Now that we\u2019re getting deeper into the weeds with the onboarding process for the Uniswap LP tokens, one of the things that came up is the liquidations process. Currently, there are no really active markets for LP tokens where they\u2019re being traded. If there are, they\u2019re definitely not doing that much volume. This leads us to this thing where keepers, especially in the next version of liquidations, can kind of win in a single transaction. However, even to an extent right now, I think what they\u2019re just doing is arbitraging. They\u2019re just going to win this auction here and then immediately dump it somewhere to capture that spread. With Uniswap LP tokens, you don\u2019t really have that. I think there needs to be a discussion in the community on how we want to handle this. If you\u2019re doing it manually, you can just buy the LP tokens. You can take them apart into the components, and then you can sell the components. Still, keepers also need to know how to price LP tokens. While that is doable, it\u2019s not entirely trivial to get the price of an LP token. Therefore, if we want to onboard Uniswap LP tokens, the keepers need to be aware of the challenges of participating in liquidations for those tokens. I want to encourage everyone to join the keeper\u2019s channel on RocketChat. Anyone interested in the liquidation side of things, especially anyone running a keeper, can discuss in there as a community about how we want to handle this and how we want to go about it. I have a couple of different things in mind, probably a little bit too long to go into on this call, but it\u2019s a topic that has to be covered.  Chris: Yeah, I was just gonna say that we should create a library for both Python and Javascript that allows one to price an LP token. That way, people could just consume that library. Whatever keeper they would write, I think those are the two most popular languages for keepers. If I were to envision how they would handle it, this would be one of the ways. Also, in liquidations 2.0, there\u2019s going to have to be some whole process for unwinding these. Those keepers who implement this will have to have a more sophisticated unwinding process if they\u2019re going to arbitrage. Nik: Yeah, that\u2019s the idea. Either on the keeper side or on the Maker protocol side, you want to break the LP tokens and the components to make them easier to handle. I\u2019m leaning towards that the keeper side as the best way to do that. I\u2019m also attempting to see if we can build up some kind of LP market in that way where we don\u2019t actually end up having to do any weird breaking of LP tokens in the liquidation contracts. That would just be weird to make a bunch of exceptions in there and potentially riskier.   LongForWisdom: Lev, I think you were trying to talk earlier. Did you have anything to add?  Lev: Yeah, I just wanted to say that MIP 30 is potentially applicable in the future to Uniswap and SushiSwap LP token collateral types. It\u2019s designed to be possible to adapt it to capture rewards on those two. I mean, Uniswap rewards have just ended. However, if those were to restart or start, or Sushiswap rewards are still a thing, I think that would really turbocharge those collateral types. Hence, it\u2019s worth considering those two things. For example, most of the work for onboarding the LP tokens like this stuff just discussed liquidations and keepers. The price feeds would apply in the same way if they were being farmed. LongForWisdom: Yeah, Lev, I\u2019m not entirely sure I caught all of that Lev because of the microphone, but perhaps you can comment on the thread. Chris: Yeah, Lev, if you could just leave your public key address, and we\u2019ll all send you a little bit of DAI, get you a sweet new microphone. LongForWisdom: Cool. Chris: Yeah, with Zoom on Linux, it\u2019s game over.   LongForWisdom: Cool, does anyone else have thoughts about liquidations for Uniswap or LP tokens? It feels like the pricing issues are the primary concern because keepers should just redeem the underlying tokens from Uniswap or SushiSwap or whatever once the auction\u2019s finished. They just need to know how much they\u2019re worth.  Chris: Yeah, our reference implementation of keepers don\u2019t do any sort of market cycling. We put that on whoever the keeper or user is of that software to cycle their collateral back out. I think that would be fair to say for LP tokens, but if we could provide a reference implementation of pricing, that would be really helpful. LongForWisdom: They said something about Uniswap themselves or any other LP token providers have worked on, right? Because it seems something that\u2019s more generally applicable rather than just\u2026 Chris: That\u2019s a really good point. There may already be a library that prices these things, so we should look, and if there isn\u2019t, maybe, we create a bitcoin grant or something to have someone make one. Juan: That\u2019s a good idea. I was thinking if there\u2019s a secondary market for the LP tokens that\u2019s big enough, then you wouldn\u2019t need to redeem them, just sell them. LongForWisdom: So, Uniswap has an implementation of the pricing. The keeper channel in RocketChat is probably the best place to discuss this further. If anyone has thoughts or is a keeper and has concerns or questions, please leave them in that channel. Anything else you want to see on this Nik before we move on? Nik: Yeah, I guess just that the action item here is to go to the keeper channel so we can discuss this more. This is not a situation where we talk about it once on the governance call as a one and done.     Charles St. Louis  Collateral Onboarding Handbook 48:13 Collateral Onboarding Handbook  1506\u00d7806 105 KB   I\u2019m going to share the form announcement in the chat. With the recent launch of the collateral onboarding handbook at collateral.makerdao.com, I\u2019d love to just give an overview of the purpose, motivation, and action items that this handbook entails.   1502\u00d7848 150 KB    1502\u00d7804 141 KB    The handbook contains all this great content. If you are new to the collateral onboarding process, begin with the getting started pages. The first page is an overview, which provides a high-level description of the entire collateral onboarding process over nine steps. It has an absolutely wonderful diagram from the DX team at the Foundation, giving all the little details of the process, including when things are posted to RocketChat and when things are on the forums, when votes happen, and so on. The next page provides an overview of the stakeholders involved in collateral onboarding. The main stakeholders are the Maker community, Maker integrators, the Domain Teams, MKR holders (AKA governors), and the collateral application proposers. The next major section details the community involvement guides. There are four main guides:  The first one provides an overview of the coordination and communication process between the involved stakeholders, adding collateral types to the protocol, their interaction, communication, where they communicate, and so on. The next document talks about the collateral onboarding calls that Juan has been hosting over the past couple of months. This document provides the information of the calls, such as the details for when to join, how to join, and links to the previous calls if you are curious to see which collateral proposers have come on to do AMA\u2019s and vouch for their collateral type. The next document talks about the collateral prioritization spreadsheet. It gives general information of why it was created, how it\u2019s used, and also a link to the actual public spreadsheet for anyone to see. The last document details the funding process or grants process for this. It mainly highlights the goals of the initiative and how it incentivizes and rewards contributors for participating.   The next four major sections are the governance process, the oracle\u2019s Domain Team guide for all their work, the smart contracts guide, and the risk guide.  The governance process goes into a little more detail than the overview page. The goal is to help understand the governance process from start to finish and learn how to coordinate and follow the necessary steps for successful collateral onboarding. As for the Oracle Domain guide, it\u2019s a comprehensive guide teaching you about how the Oracle Domain works and what they do continuously. It also goes into details about how to onboard an Oracle using the MIP10 framework. As for the Smart Contracts Domain Team guide, it highlights what the Domain Team does. They do a lot of things outside of collateral onboarding, but this gives a thorough explanation of all the steps involved, such as how to create a token assessment, what resources to use, how to add collateral types to the Maker protocol code base, as well as all the requirements for testing and so on. The Risk Assessment helps understand the purpose of Risk Assessments when onboarding collateral and provides the data and methodology behind building these assessments.   There\u2019s a resource section for having a glossary of all the terms used throughout these guides and documents to have a go-to place to figure out all the key terms. Lastly is the resource list, which also collects all the links and resources throughout the guides in one go-to place.     Frank Cruz: This is super awesome, Charles. Thank you to you and the rest of the team. My question pertains to RWA. I would imagine you\u2019re going to expand this when we get a clearer picture of how to onboard a Real World Asset. I guess what I\u2019m saying is if this is a little too early to push this to say, and I\u2019m going to exaggerate a bit here, to tokenize the New York Jets? It may be a little too early, right?  Charles: So, with the Real-World Asset progress, there are currently two for those who aren\u2019t familiar with Matthew Rabinowitz and Centrifuge. As we go through those processes, I\u2019ve been documenting them. Once we get to a state where we\u2019re comfortable with the RWA onboarding, we\u2019ll have a pretty extensive guide detailing the difference between the ERC-20 collateral onboarding or more crypto-related versus RWA. So, yeah, it\u2019s definitely in progress, and it will be more formalized as we experience the current RWA onboard. Frank: All right, thank you. Charles: I would be keen to know about the NYJ you want to tokenize, though.   LongForWisdom: Thank you for that Charles, I guess I would just like to quickly race through Charles\u2019s point. This documentation feels like a huge step forwards in terms of decentralizing the collateral onboarding process. Saying that this is the first time we\u2019ve actually had transparent processes laid down for how to actually go about doing Domain Assessments for each of the domains and what needs to happen has preached to me to onboard something. Therefore, it\u2019s a huge step forward, in my opinion. Thank you, Charles, for helping put it together or for coordinating to putting it together.  Charles: Yeah, I definitely want to give a shout-out to everyone involved. There were quite a bit of people working on this. By no means was it just myself. The integrations team at the Foundation, the DX team, and the Marcoms team, and some community contributors were involved. Thanks, everyone. LongForWisdom: Yeah, I know the Domain Teams themselves, so I obviously helped source all the content.     Christopher Mooney  Timeline for DsChief 1.2 Revealed 1:00:36  1694\u00d7946 144 KB   This is a little bit more detail on the timeline. We\u2019re currently in that code review first step. I know the timeline says the 13th of November and the week of the 16th, but we\u2019re finishing up the code review right now. We just made some changes to the tests and whatnot, and we\u2019ll probably merge that today or tomorrow. Then I\u2019m hoping that tomorrow afternoon after we do the executive or some of us in the morning begin working on an executive to deploy DsChief 1.2 to Kovan. That\u2019ll probably sit in review for the weekend. I\u2019m hoping that we can deploy it to Kovan on Monday so that anybody who needs to integrate with DsChief 1.2, which means any UI and governance portal stuff, will be ready next week. Of course, next week is also a holiday in the US; it\u2019s the week of Thanksgiving, and the executive is on Black Friday. On the 27th, we\u2019ll put the executive up for mainnet, and people can begin voting on it. This is where we\u2019re going to want things to hopefully be pretty aggressive on the voting. I\u2019m skeptical that we\u2019ll get involvement on that week. I\u2019m guessing it won\u2019t be until the following Monday, the 30th, or the first of December where we\u2019re finally garnering enough votes to pass the executive. Once that passes, we\u2019re in a 72-hour delay. This period of time is pretty critical. We want to keep as much MKR on the hat as possible, just defending the old chief before the executive\u2019s actually executed and the old chief loses its permissions. Once the executive is executed, the old chief loses its authority to manipulate the system. The new chief is granted authority to manipulate the system. However, it\u2019s not active yet. At that point, we can pull all of our MKR out of the chief 1.2, the old chief, and we can put it onto. I think we\u2019re gonna use address zero or proposal zero to launch the new chief. Currently, there\u2019s a hundred thousand MKR threshold hard-coded to launch that new chief. Once we get to the hundred thousand MKR mark, we\u2019ll be able to activate it. Then the new chief will work, except it\u2019ll be flash loan resistant or actually maybe even proof. Although I don\u2019t wanna say proof because someone noted that recently and then they got flash loaned, so we\u2019ll be flash loan resistant after that point. I wanted to mention that we should have a signal poll for how much MKR we should hard code into the chief to activate it. I believe 100,000 MKR is a reasonable number that we can typically hit. However, we have to keep in mind that many custody providers Coinbase Custody Anchorage have or are all tooled up to vote on the old chief and may need to adapt their code to allow their people to vote on the new one. We may not easily get the 100,000, so we might want to consider something that\u2019s still resistant. I guess the new chief will resist the flash loans anyway, so maybe we really want to think about like 80 or 75 to activate the new chief. That\u2019s it. Sorry that it was longer than I was expecting. You got to stop me when I start yammering.  LongForWisdom: No, no, I think that was fine, Chris. that was a good explanation. We\u2019ll probably just discuss the hard-coded amount and figure out a number rather than polling. It doesn\u2019t feel like a thing that would really benefit from polling in this case.   Chris: Yeah, if anyone has a strong opinion on that, then please let Long or myself know.  LongForWisdom: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna be drastically different from the 80 to 100 range; it\u2019ll be either somewhere in there or slightly around. Chris: Pretty much yes, we will also re-enable the osm mom and the flipper mom, so that\u2019s the ability to freeze oracles and enable and disable liquidations. LongForWisdom: I guess the question is, would we also consider changing the GSM as well? Chris: Yes, actually, maybe we should consider changing the GSM as well. I don\u2019t see why we couldn\u2019t go back to 12 at that point, but\u2026 LongForWisdom: Yeah, I think it might be something we poll on again because it\u2019s potentially worth discussing. I believe it\u2019s true that 12 hours is not a realistic time to get together a sufficient amount of Maker to cancel something if needed.   Primoz: I was mostly asking to find out how gas-intensive this all is because we\u2019re going to make so many other changes and inclusions mid-December.  Chris: How gas-intensive the new chief is? Primoz: No, sorry. If we do all the collateral onboarding, everything that\u2019s following in December, and then include these two votes as well, is it possible we\u2019re gonna fill the whole block? Chris: Well, the chief is gonna go out on its own. We\u2019re not bundling anything with it aside from pushing us back into the state we were in before disabling the moms. All of the collateral onboarding stuff which is going to come in the following weeks will be separate. Although we\u2019re going to have to see how it pans out. We have such an aggressive schedule that we may hit deployment limits, so the contracts themselves may overrun the size of contracts that we can put into a block. Then we\u2019ll have to split them. Of course, there\u2019s only 12 million gas available in a block. We\u2019ll have to see if we run it to either that limit or if we also possibly run into execution limits. Those are the two things that we\u2019ll end up having to look at in the executives that come after this.   LongForWisdom: Cool, yeah, excellent Chris, yeah, something\u2019s becoming more relevant now that we have more collateral types.   Open Discussion  Descriptive Header 1:08:39  LongForWisdom: If anybody has any sort of questions or comments about any of the topics that have come up in this call, now would be a good time to voice them and spend five to ten minutes to discuss. I guess Derek is here. I\u2019ll ask Derek if there\u2019s been any movement on the polls. I\u2019m figuring out the results.  Derek: Good question. Sam\u2019s pulled the data for me. I\u2019m just checking within the Foundation to make sure that we get all the data we need. From our first take, it looks like the new portal wasn\u2019t correctly counting negative transfer votes. When I look at the old portal again, there\u2019s a discrepancy with who the winner is. At the moment, seems like one percent but because of that discrepancy, let us just check the on-chain data first before coming back to you with a final answer. We\u2019re working through it, and I\u2019ll post on the forum or in the chat once we get some final numbers. LongForWisdom: Thanks, Derek. I\u2019ll update the same thing on the forum once the results come out.   joshlevine: Yeah, there\u2019s one thing I would mention real quick if you don\u2019t mind. Regarding the polling, we should verify it against on-chain data. Still, as far as I can tell, the old portal is correct with that specific poll\u2019s tally. It has to do with how it was running the instant runoff voting algorithm. I\u2019m talking about the lower stablecoin stability fee poll. However, one thing to note is that even though the portal says that there is a winner, it\u2019s kind of erroneous because no individual option has more than 50 percent, which technically, if you\u2019re following the strict instant runoff voting rules, means that nothing is won. So, there\u2019s no clear mandate going forward if that\u2019s the result, just as an FYI.  SamM: Yeah, I\u2019m just looking at the initial data. It seems like a lot of people have voted for only one thing. I would recommend doing multiple votes in ranked-choice voting. LongForWisdom: I\u2019ll just comment on that briefly as well. In general, for the ranked-choice polls, I do try to specifically say in the \u2018next steps\u2019 section what will happen if we don\u2019t get a majority. For this poll, I did include a statement saying if the result gains a majority of votes, then the stability fees will be changed. Therefore, the absence of any of the options having a majority results in a default, which is for us to not change the stability fees. I was briefly talking to Primoz before the call about what we would do in this situation. Primoz can maybe talk about it if you want.   Primoz: Yeah, sure. I see things that if stability fees stay as they are, that essentially means tomorrow we will already start to have flap auctions. Since we can\u2019t really make any executive votes for about two weeks or more, we\u2019re definitely going to spend fees from stablecoins, which is about 50k per day. In about 20 days until the next executive, you\u2019re going to spend 1 million on stablecoin fees on flop auctions. I don\u2019t necessarily see this as a problem if we already know that the PSM will be implemented. We\u2019re going to implement a low fee because doing this will collect the stablecoin accrued fees, which will measure about 4 million. However, suppose we don\u2019t do that around the 15th or 20th of December. In that case, the total accrued fees on stablecoins will measure to four million, which is the same amount as the surplus buffer. It really comes to the question of what do we think about PSM? We clearly didn\u2019t have a vote from Maker holders. In case this doesn\u2019t get implemented with a low fee, those fees are actually not necessarily going to be collected in the future. In that sense, we would probably need to immediately increase the surplus buffer in the next possible executive vote. The other option is proposing a two percent fee on stablecoins. It is kind of a vote in the middle in some sense if I look correctly. I\u2019m not really sure. However, if it doesn\u2019t pass, we have a problem. We have other votes this week, and we want this executive to pass. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s wise to propose two percent right now.  SamM: Yeah, it\u2019s unfortunate. Only 15 percent of the vote went for \u2018no change.\u2019 Many people want to lower to some degree, but it seems people just didn\u2019t check off enough votes; that\u2019s a problem. Derek: Looking at the old portal, which is correct like joshlevine said, the winning vote was one percent, and that\u2019s from first choice 3000 MKR and transferred votes 23.000 MKR, which is a 37 percent amount.   LongForWisdom: Yeah, Greg, to answer your question; We think the new UI is definitely wrong at this point. There is no clear winner for the poll. The top three options have are 37, 35, and 15 percent.  Gregory Di Prisco: Will that result in a change or no? LongForWisdom: No, which is what I was saying. This is due to no single option being greater than 50 percent. SamM: Yeah, but from a technical perspective, that\u2019s true. I mean, this is kind of a weird case because it\u2019s pretty clear that a lot of people want it lower to some degree, and they\u2019re fighting over which degree it\u2019s lowered. LongForWisdom: Yes, I agree. This is why we\u2019re discussing it. Two percent is potentially a compromise option because, as you say, it\u2019s correct that most people seem to want to lower it to some degree.   MakerMan: Aren\u2019t we just dealing with this one vault, though? I don\u2019t understand why we didn\u2019t only attack this one vault with a low SF to buy us time just in one shot, one number.  LongForWisdom: I mean, you can\u2019t start this if you\u2019re on a single vault right now because I\u2019m not sure what you mean. Chris: It\u2019s all CR 101 collateral types. They all went out around the same time. Therefore, they\u2019re all hitting their expiration dates.   SamM: A conservative, safe option to me appears to be lowering to three percent because 70 percent of the vote is lower than that.  LongForWisdom: Yeah, I guess. I don\u2019t hate three percent about how that actually affects the fees and the implementation timeline. I guess what I\u2019m saying is how much better than four percent is three percent in this case?   SamM: Gives us another week or so?  Matthew Rabinowitz: Yeah, something is better than nothing. LongForWisdom: My question is, does a weak extra help a lot? SamM: This is problematic because now we\u2019re locked out of the executives for two weeks, and we don\u2019t know the result. Do people even want the PSM? We\u2019re very undetermined right now. One thing I did want to say, which Primoz mentioned, is increasing the surplus buffer. Option three of the stablecoin action plan is currently the main plan we are proceeding with until there\u2019s a vote otherwise to override it. LongForWisdom: Previously, I guess, was to drop them to zero percent and then replace them with newer Vaults, wasn\u2019t it? Potentially, it is more evidence that people want to lower them to some extent. All right, I think Primoz and I will discuss this after the call. This isn\u2019t the best place to decide what we\u2019re doing and consider whether we want to include a change to reduce it by one, two, or percent in the executive. SamM: That seems like a reasonable compromise.   LongForWisdom: All right, so it\u2019s 25 past the hour. I think we\u2019ll wrap up the call. A couple of final reminders: next week is Thanksgiving. The call falls on the 26th. Therefore, we\u2019re gonna go ahead and skip that call next week. There\u2019ll be no governance call on the 26th of November. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a huge benefit in having it when half of the participants will be busy enjoying themselves. I\u2019ll post this in the forum as well. Hopefully, everyone will get the memo. I\u2019d like to remind everyone once again to vote in that poll I mentioned at the beginning of the call about whether we want to move this time for the call an hour later because, in this case, the people in this call are the main stakeholders for that vote. It\u2019s not gonna go on-chain or anything, but it\u2019s for the people here to determine if that\u2019s gonna be a thing or not.

I\u2019m joined by a collection of Maker focused people, and we\u2019ve got an agenda as usual for today. My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the governance facilitator at MakerDAO. Feel free to interrupt people as they\u2019re talking. We\u2019d love you to get involved. If it\u2019s a problem for anyone, then we\u2019ll let you know. I\u2019ll briefly skim through the agenda before we get started. There\u2019s some housekeeping stuff I\u2019m going to go through during the intro. We\u2019ve got weekly updates from each of the main domains with a couple of extras. We\u2019ve got a couple of segments this week. And we\u2019ve got an introduction from Marvin, the Kleros Maker fellow that Amy has recently spoken about. Vishesh is going to be doing the state of the peg. Then hexonaut, also known as Sam McPherson, is going to give us an update on the PSM implementation progress. Finally, we\u2019ll descend into anarchy and discussion as usual. As I mentioned last week, we will be moving the time for this call to one hour later. I think we\u2019ll start doing that in January because it\u2019s a nice and clean separation into a new year. Hopefully, we won\u2019t get people confused when it happens. Therefore, next week we\u2019ll continue to be at 16:00 UTC, and then in January, we\u2019ll move to 17:00 UTC. The times will always reflect in the agendas. If you\u2019re not sure, just check the agenda. We won\u2019t be having this call or weekly governance cycles for two weeks over the holiday periods. Those weeks are the week starting the 21st and the 28th. That pretty much covers Christmas and New Year. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Updates LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 02:54 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated. Discussions   Rates Changes Proposal 7 Dec 2020  Primoz posts this month\u2019s rate updates proposal for discussion before moving to an on-chain poll. LongForWisdom: One of the most active discussions was on the rates change proposal proposed this Monday by the rates group. I imagine Primoz will talk about this a little bit more in his section, but that\u2019s met some discussion, which is great. It\u2019s good to get feedback from everyone when crafting those proposals.    Road to the PSM  Hexonaut continues to update the community on the status of the PSM implementation and deployment process. LongForWisdom: Hexonaut has continued to update the thread \u201cRoad to the PSM,\u201d which keeps everyone up to date on the progress with the PSM implementation. I think it\u2019s going very well, and as I said, we\u2019ll let him talk about that a little bit later.    Launching Oasis on IPFS  MagoCrypto proposes launching an oasis mirror on IPFS, which raises questions on what it means for the DAO to take responsibility UI\u2019s into the Maker Protocol. LongForWisdom: We also had an interesting thread from user MangoCrypto talking about launching Oasis on IPFS, basically mirroring the Oasis site on IPFS, which I thought was an interesting discussion as it opens the question of whether the DAO is responsible for that mirror or the mirror of UI\u2019s in general, which is an interesting question.    On the priority of real-world assets: Where do we stand?  Spin from Centrifuge comments on the prioritization of real-world assets in the Maker Protocol and asks what else MKR Holders can do to get those assets prioritized. LongForWisdom: The RWA priority thread continues to respond and build excitement for RWA, which we\u2019re all looking forward to over the next few weeks or months.    Introducing DssGovRewards  Hexonaut introduces rewards for MKR Voting and asks for feedback from governance in this direction. LongForWidom: Finally, the DssGovRewards thread from SamM has seen many comments from various people discussing the relative benefits of rewards for locking MKR in the Chief versus MKR burn and a lot of other stuff.    Signal Requests   PSM Parameters  Primoz puts forward some signals to determine the initial parameters of the PSM deployment. LongForWisdom: The PSM parameter signal has been set up by Primoz to help determine the PSM implementation\u2019s initial parameters, assuming everything goes well in terms of implementation. I\u2019d encourage everyone to look at that because it\u2019s a fairly big deal.    Vault Compensation Working Group Payment  Monet-supply proposes payment for the black Thursday compensation working group from the system surplus. LongForWisdom: We had a signal request from MonetSupply on behalf of the vault conversation working group, which is still a little bit of a blast from the past at this point. That signal request deals with reimbursing that working group for hours, organizing the compensation proposals, and managing that process. There\u2019s been some discussion about the various things we need to consider when paying people from the protocol. It\u2019s worth noting this is this would be the first signal request that has proposed taking money from the protocol to pay for something; therefore, it\u2019s potentially a landmark thing.    YFI Vault Options & Adjust ETH-B Debt Ceiling  Primoz describes some of the options for the YFI-A Vault and asks for the community to weigh in. Ultraschuppi signals on increasing the ETH-B Debt Ceiling. LongForWisdom: The only other two signal requests went to on-chain polls, which finished a little while ago dealing with the ETH-B Debt Ceiling and the YFI vault options. The YFI and the ETH-B polls have passed, as did many other polls proposed this week. Chris M: What did the stablecoin poll end up as? LongForWisdom: That passed, twenty-four thousand to six thousand, so 78% in favor.   Other governance updates. As was mentioned before the recording started, we have still had yet to successfully migrate to the new DsChief. Maybe Chris can talk a little bit about that more in a minute, but if you haven\u2019t voted for or haven\u2019t moved your MKR from the old Chief to the new Chief, please consider doing so.  Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 08:02  Quick update for last week: DsChief 1.2 is now out. We\u2019re still waiting to launch it. We have almost 67.000 MKR on the Chief, on that zero proposal. Once that has hit the 80.000 mark, anyone can go to Etherscan and call the launch function, to which I dropped a link earlier. You just hook up your web3 client to launch. That\u2019ll launch the Chief. There\u2019s no delay after that. We can immediately start using the Chief with the next executive. In terms of collateral assessments, we did MIP22 this past week. That\u2019s the Real World Assets. Specifically, in this case, the New Silver\u2019s Drop Tokens. I think we\u2019re still working with Centrifuge and those guys to make a few updates. Regarding collateral onboarding for Kovan, we have UNI, renBTC, and MIP27, which is the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module, or the Debt Ceiling Auto Line. All of that is in Kovan now. It was passed earlier today. All of that stuff is active in Kovan and can be played with. I\u2019ll have an update in Rocketchat a little bit later. We\u2019re still working on the DS executive. That stuff is still in review. Well, It\u2019s actually finished; it\u2019s just that there\u2019s a lot to it. It\u2019s a pretty hefty review. We didn\u2019t do any collateral onboarding work in the priority sheet. Still, I think there was a priority sheet work hit by another team, so we\u2019ll wait for that. As for the domain teamwork, we\u2019ve been working on MIP21, which is the Real World Assets for 6S. MIP22, which is the one I mentioned earlier. We\u2019ve also been working on MIP27, which is the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module. Naz did killer work collateral onboarding UNI into Kovan; everything looked great. The same goes for Sam with renBTC into Kovan. Sam is still working on the PSM. Just to clarify, there\u2019s a post in the forums about how the Foundation isn\u2019t going to be involved with the PSM. This is truly the DAO being autonomous here. During the coming week, we\u2019re going to be putting AAVE into Kovan, MIP21 into Kovan, and the UNI-v2-DAI-ETH LP Token into Kovan. In the Friday executive, tomorrow, we\u2019ll have the polling results for UNI, renBTC, and MIP27. The DC Instant Access Module will be what we vote on Friday. Presumably, the Chief will launch by then, if it hasn\u2019t launched by noon on Friday. The stuff that\u2019s scheduled for this week gets bumped, and we can\u2019t get to AAVE, MIP21, or the UNI-V2-DAI-ETH LP tokens until next year. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll set a little urgency, but if you were sitting around waiting for something to happen, now is the time to put your MKR on the Chief to launch it. Collateral assessment work still needs to be done for tBTC. We still have outstanding Domain Team reviews for MIP14,17,25, 29, and 30. As for the Foundation, we\u2019ve mostly been assisting with a really aggressive schedule for the end of the year. We\u2019re not really on our own tasks right now, but we\u2019ve been helping out. Also, the Foundation has two new smart contract team members; Tanner and Emilio. Welcome, guys; you\u2019re desperately needed. We\u2019re super psyched to have you. That\u2019s it, anyone has any questions?  Questions and Comments  Frank: Chris, Regarding MIP27. I\u2019m just trying to understand. Could you clarify if it\u2019s just going to be ETH, right? There\u2019s no UNI?  Chris: MIP27 is going to be deployed with ETH-B, which is a secondary Ethereum collateral type. I think we just want to dip our toe in the water with it and see if it works. If it\u2019s functional, then we\u2019ll possibly expand it out to other collaterals after that. Frank: That\u2019s not going to go to the next executive, right, until 2021, is that right? Chris: Yeah, it\u2019ll be in 2021. I think Risk will want to develop parameters for each of the different collateral types, and then we\u2019ll activate it.   Frank: And, with regards to the griefing attacks, is that something that\u2019s going to be battle-tested before being deployed? On Kovan, maybe?  Chris: Concerning any griefing attacks, we\u2019re on ETH-B right now, which means they\u2019re less effective. I think the position that we\u2019re taking comes from the benefits of having the instant ability to adjust the debt ceiling both upwards and immediately downwards. Both those benefits outweigh the downside that a whale may choose to grief the debt ceiling on the downside to hard cap it. ETH-B is a really good experimental case for that. If we find that there\u2019s griefing, it\u2019s no different than if we were at a capped debt ceiling on a particular collateral type. We could deal with it within the next weekly executive cycle. Therefore, as I said, it\u2019s not worse than that. The benefits are pretty great because we don\u2019t have to spend as many cognitive resources, Risk, smart contracts work, and governance cycles always chasing the debt ceilings.   Lev: I just want to say that I\u2019m a bit concerned that maybe the scope of the issue is a bit broader than just griefing because it could be that it naturally happens due to the turn in debt. When the instant access module gets poked, the debt ceiling moves down a lot easier than it goes up. You could imagine some scenario where it is always staying near the bottom range because of the dynamics without even adversarially grieving it. As we think about solutions for improving it later, I would think of it as not even requiring an adversarial situation to have it malfunction.  BrianMcmichael: I totally agree with that, Lev. I think the initial proposal of 12 hours might be too long because of that concern. As people are pulling out, we would have to be expecting people to be putting in at the same rate. Otherwise, the ceilings are just going to keep declining, and if that\u2019s only 12 hours. It might be a while before we can bump it back up. I think the original plan and the design were to expect around one hour to match the OSM times to avoid an OSM attack. However, I think that\u2019s a variable that\u2019s up to Governance, and we would have to see it in practice.   LongForWisdom: Cool, thanks for the discussion. I think the main thing is just to see how it pans out, right? This is the reason we\u2019re currently doing it with only ETH-B. It\u2019s a reasonably failure-risk-free way of testing it. That brings up one other thing I should possibly mention. In the polls this week, there was one poll for increasing the ETH-B debt ceiling, and there was also the poll for implementing the DCIM on ETH-B. It\u2019s worth noting that the DCIM on ETH-B will override the debt ceiling increase, to the point where there\u2019s not really any point in doing both. Given that they both passed and assuming smart contracts is still OK with deploying it, we\u2019ll just do the DCIM rather than the ETH-B manual debt ceiling increase. Chris: I agree with that.  Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 18:32  This past week, we published the postmortem for the oracle outage. I didn\u2019t really see much discussion or many questions about it on the forum. Still, if anyone has any follow-up questions, I\u2019m more than happy to answer them. We also published the collateral onboarding assessments for three of the Uniswap-v2 LP tokens, for USDC-ETH, for DAI-ETH, and for WBTC-ETH. Even though we\u2019ve done all three assessments, the oracle contract we wrote for these tokens is bespoke. If we were to wait for an audit before onboarding these LP tokens, it could be quite a few months. Therefore, we\u2019ve chosen to pursue a strategy where we would release one of them with a fairly low debt ceiling after we\u2019ve done some meticulous internal reviews. Essentially, that\u2019s almost like a bounty in the sense that someone can hack the contract and steal up to that low debt ceiling that we set. That\u2019s the bounty program that we\u2019re instating. That being said, it would just be DAI-ETH. Then USDC-ETH and WBTC-ETH would be on hold until we either have more confidence in the new smart contract oracle overtime or get formalized audits completed. We\u2019ve put Kovan oracles into a staging environment. So far, everything seems to be working nominally. I\u2019ve tried it against a few randomly different LP pairs to start checking that everything is working. In terms of whitelisting, I think we have a proposal from YFI by Yearn on the YFI vault. The polling vote was two weeks ago, which passed. However, it didn\u2019t go into that week\u2019s executive because we started the Chief migration instead. I think we\u2019re still about 14.000 MKR short. If the Chief migration completes tomorrow, then we can put it into tomorrow\u2019s executive. Furthermore, there\u2019s a whitelisting proposal from Gnosis for settling prediction markets. The first proposal is for the ETH oracle security module. I\u2019ve been talking to Christian, and I understand that there\u2019s quite a few more coming. That poll will go live on Monday. I actually think it\u2019s interesting that they chose the oracle security module over the medianizer. The oracle security module just adds a delay. It\u2019s only effectively updated at the top of the hour, once per hour. When you\u2019re a customer, you have this decision that you have to make depending on how you\u2019re using the oracle price; Do you want the oracle to be more sensitive, or do you want the oracle to be more secure? In the case of an oracle attack, there\u2019s nothing we can do to protect you from the medianizer value becoming some malicious value. We can do things to protect you from the oracle security module value becoming a malicious value. Therefore, they\u2019re different trade-offs on the scale of security versus sensitivity. We\u2019ve seen in the past that the only organizations or projects that are using the oracle security module are doing so because they are using it to manage their vaults. They wanted to know what the price would be an hour from now so that they won\u2019t get liquidated. Gnosis is the first project that seems to be using the oracle security module and is not doing vault management. I thought this is rather notable. Everyone else seems to be taking the more sensitive oracle\u2019s trade-off space than the secure one.  Questions and Comments  Lucas Vogelsang: I wanted to pick up the conversation on the New Silver oracle because it seems the only thing there that is missing is the oracle assessments. Smart contracts and Risk are out. With the schedule over the holidays, I was curious about your idea on the timeline and prioritization? Nik: I think it will be following the release of the Uniswap LP oracles. I\u2019ve been putting in a couple of months\u2019 worth of work into that. We\u2019re basically in the home stretch; therefore, all my attention is focused on this at the moment. After that, I would be looking at the real-world asset stuff and getting those assessments out.  Lucas Vogelsang: Do you think that it\u2019s realistic to aim for a first executive of the year timeline? I\u2019m asking because New Silver is getting ready to have loans. We\u2019d love to see this happen. I know it\u2019s not your only priority, but I believe knowing a timeline would be super helpful. Nik: I think I can get the oracle assessment in before the end of the year. Then, pending what comes out of that executive, if it requires us building anything new, it may or may not be the first executive when we get back.   Lucas Vogelsang: Long, from a governance point of view, what are the dates for polls in the first executive?  LongForWisdom: The first polling week would be the week beginning on the fourth. I don\u2019t know whether smart contracts would be ready to implement something that went in that week on the 8th. Usually, they ask for an extra week to manage the\u2026 Chris: We could certainly start putting MIP22 into Kovan that week. Lucas, we\u2019ll work with you on getting that in Kovan so that it would be prepped next week for mainnet.   Lucas Vogelsang: Yeah, that would be feasible on our end.  LongForWisdom: I would say the 8th or the 15th. I think the 15th is probably more likely, but it\u2019s possible.   Lucas Vogelsang: Nik, that\u2019s great to hear. If it is out by the end of the year, it will be able to get going to the polls in the first week. That\u2019s very exciting, thanks.  Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 28:11  Regarding collateral evaluations, we only have one more plan to be released until the end of the year or potentially two. The one that we\u2019re still missing and is in progress is tBTC. The other two remaining collaterals were actually just published today. These were wBTC, UNI LP, and ConsolFreight Drop Tokens. We also started looking at farmable cUSDC Cropjoin Adapter Implementation, which is MIP30, which is probably the next focus collateral that\u2019ll be evaluated from our side. This one might need a more careful evaluation of economic risk. Still, hopefully, we can have something proposed by the end of the year. On the real-world asset side, Sebastian informed me that most of the work is currently focused on building monitoring tools for real-world assets. In terms of the other things we\u2019ve worked on over the past few weeks, the PSM risk assessment has been published. It compares the PSM with the current implementation of low liquidation stablecoin vaults and the risks and benefits. I also published the signal on the remaining PSM risk parameters, which need to be decided. Parameters that are still missing are starting the debt ceiling and the stablecoins included in the PSM. We also released an updated risk premium table. This served the Rates group to propose rates, which was actually done this week. Rates proposed a published report and should move onto an on-chain poll and executive if passed next week. We\u2019re hoping to execute all of the ten stability fee changes in one executive vote on the 18th. We hope we don\u2019t hit the block limit. Finally, I also published a risk evaluation on the debt ceiling instant access module. This was already discussed. We did a test run with ETH-B. Parameters were proposed from our side, and we\u2019ll see next year how we move on to other collaterals. For the next few weeks, as I mentioned, we\u2019ll focus mostly on the cUSDC CropJoin Implementation. I also commented on the b.Protocol proposal about renBitcoin-B vaults, which, at first look, seems to be an interesting proposal. But you also need to get some feedback from other domains because the implementation requires some code changes on the Maker side. Finally, we\u2019ll be monitoring things, of course, assuming the executive votes pass as planned. If not, we\u2019ll potentially need to propose some parameter changes due to limited governance during the holidays. Suppose something happens to the stability fee being disabled on stablecoins. In that case, we may need to propose a higher surplus buffer, for example.  Questions and Comments  LongForWisdom: Alright, thanks, Primoz. Could you comment on the forum concerning the YFI stability fee raise?  Primoz: Yeah, I made a signal a week ago. There were a few options. The winning vote is actually the YFI B-wall with a higher liquidation ratio. However, since we can\u2019t execute this year, the next winning vote was to increase the debt ceiling to 30 million. By calculating risks and doing analysis, the vault type with such a debt ceiling was risky, and the calculated risk premium was ten percent. This was the option that they chose, and of course, some people thought this doesn\u2019t make sense because we\u2019re not going to see a 30 million debt utilization. If we don\u2019t see that, then the 10% stability fee doesn\u2019t make sense. I agree with that. The problem was probably because I provided only one option: a stability fee equal to the risk premium. However, I think what I should do the next time is to inform the community about the risk premium. Still, it\u2019s actually up to the community to decide whether this already implies we\u2019re going to see a lower debt exposure. That\u2019s why we should initially propose a lower stability fee that equals a lower risk premium. Then, in the end, we actually propose a lower stability fee in the rates proposal. We did another calculation of vault type that has a slightly better collateralization ratio. This got a nine percent risk premium, which was the rate we chose. However, it remains to be seen. If we see a lot of repayment and that exposure decreases, we\u2019ll probably need to go with a lower stability fee. It\u2019s about trying to find the balance. It\u2019s not necessarily easy to assume what will be exposed in advance and then apply the applicable stability fee. We learned something, and for the next time, we\u2019ll probably choose a different methodology. As I had said, the initial problem was the YFI B-vault isn\u2019t doable, and that\u2019s why we needed to go with this proposal. LongForWisdom: Thank you, Primoz. I think we saw the on-chain poll for the YFI pass, so I don\u2019t believe that Maker voters necessarily disagree with the outcome. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to apologize about, but I agree that maybe more options in the future might be good.    Amy Jung Community Development Team Update 34:58  One of the support domain pieces is maintaining the health of the other domains and keeping everyone updated. Therefore, I did want to bring up a concern that I know has been discussed but around this domain team burnout. I just wanted to remind people and any new community members that we\u2019re in the middle of this transitioning of core responsibilities from the Foundation to the DAO. The Foundation is quite limited in its ability to support certain things, as you can see in cases such as the PSM. I see our teams juggling many things such as core development work, new features, MIPs, monitoring, onboarding new contributors, and then a bunch of less obvious things that take away attention and time, such as optimizing coordination processes and being able to communicate with the community. Just for context, I did want to highlight that the smart contracts team has been onboarding two contributors; Sam and Naz. Risk has onboarded around seven contributors and then working on two risk tooling grants. Then we have three proposed new facilitators; Juan, Seb, and Sam. Thinking about how we are shifting to become more responsive rather than reactive and intentional in the way we\u2019re scaling and nurturing quality growth takes a little more time. All this being said, the work is set for this year. Next year will be another exciting year, but I think we should really consider consolidating before speeding up again. That\u2019s something that I wanted to share with the larger community.  Questions and Comments  Frank: Hi Amy, as the DAO is going to be the frontrunner, are you planning to give the community an update on how things are going to work when the DAO does take over for 2021, and even in 2022? Are you and Juan going to do community calls where you\u2019re going to explain how it will work and where we\u2019re going to get to retain people like Chris Mooney, Nik, etc.?  Amy: Yeah, I think our best-case scenario is that everybody who\u2019s currently working the DAO is ushering this smooth transition as our goal is. And this will continue. For example, I may leave the Foundation but continue my work as a facilitator. We call it \u201cbuilding rockets\u201d in that each of these teams will be working with the DAO in its own form. So, there will be support. Juan and I will support the domain teams; we\u2019ll be communicating a lot more. Juan is also taking many great initiatives right now that are bridging a lot of these transitional moments. As I said, with the Foundation, we\u2019re limited to what we can support. We\u2019re helping bridge a lot of the primary core responsibilities and then be able to communicate that. You\u2019ll see next year we will get a little more reporting on what this means for the DAO, how\u2019s the DAO supported, etc., which will be coming from the support domains and not necessarily from a Foundation point of view. Did that answer your question? Frank: Yeah, totally, and I guess with regards to tools that are going to be needed, I think you\u2019re already doing the research on that. I mention this because I was in some seminar. I heard that a former FBI spoke about moving to a decentralized state, which is a bit weird going from FBI to now building software tools for decentralized organizations? It got me thinking last night; what will have to be implemented to run the DAO and get everybody paid, and how do you think about benefits? Besides MKR and DAI, do people need a 401k and Health Benefits in the US or other countries? Amy: Exactly, I actually just got off the call with Opolis. They\u2019re building this network. I think it\u2019s being able to pull different resources going back to what you were saying about the FBI guy. We have to think a lot about tech ops and dev ops, which we\u2019re actively discussing. It is one of those things which is strange to think of it in a decentralized way; what is the processes for that, that happens in a kind of trusted and trustless manner? However, we\u2019re definitely thinking about it. We\u2019re trying to get other legal communities involved. There\u2019s also Marvin, who\u2019s going to speak and introduce himself in the beginning. It\u2019s all in the research phase. We\u2019re trying to gather the resources and then share them with the community. Frank: Nice, bright future ahead, looking forward to it.    Juan Collateral Call Update 41:10  We had a pretty busy week. On Monday, we had a really interesting call with Lev and Rain, where we went through the second \u201cknow your MIP.\u201d It was very, very interesting. We covered MIP30. Well, they covered MIP30; I was more on the question side of the discussion. MIP30 is the farmable CUSDC adapter, i.e., the CropJoin that was mentioned previously. This happened on Monday. Then, On Tuesday, we had the b.Protocol team and also Naz from WFIL.network. They presented their project and the collateral. Yesterday, we had Mona from x.Melon protocol, which is being renamed into Enzyme protocol. This is also very interesting. I\u2019m going to post the links on the sidebar. Next week, we will have a Real-World Assets wrap up kind of thing. Seb and Lucas are going to be there. They\u2019re going to be three asset originators. We\u2019re going to have a look back on 2020 and foreshadow 2021. The three originators are Harbor Trade Credits, Peoples Company, and Fortunafi. I\u2019m expecting a very interesting call. This will happen on Wednesday the 16th at 6:00 PM UTC. I think it\u2019s quite impressive to look back at what each team at Maker has accomplished in the last couple of weeks or months. It seems that time is flying. I think it\u2019s good what we\u2019re achieving. We need to also celebrate what we\u2019re building and not just focus on rushing towards infinity.  Charles St. Louis MIPs Update 43:49  I have a couple things I want to talk about. Still, as you mentioned, because there\u2019s no governance cycle this month, it is relatively short. Therefore, I\u2019m just going to give a verbal update. I will be posting an update on the forums as usual. A couple of new proposals came in, as Amy mentioned earlier, for some domain team onboarding. SamM has proposed himself as a Smart Contract\u2019s Domain Team Facilitator. SebVentures has also proposed himself as a Risk Team Facilitator, which is pretty awesome to see. In terms of some new pre-MIP discussions, we had a couple come up. There\u2019s one by Matthew Rabinowitz for throttled surplus buffer. There also ongoing discussions that are still pretty active on delegation of authority and real-estate tokenization, and of course, the liquidations 2.0 technical summary. In terms of quick collateral onboarding updates, there were three governance polls for collateral onboarding that went live on Monday and have passed today. They are for AAVE, and UNI-USDC-ETH, and UNI-DAI-ETH. There are now seven collateral types awaiting an executive vote past the governance poll stage: renBTC, RWA aka 6s, UNI, AAVE, two UNI LP tokens that I just mentioned, and PAXG. The executives scheduled for them are one on December 11th for both UNI and renBTC. On December 18th, the executive for the RWA, AAVE, and then the UNI LP token for DAI-ETH. The rest have been unscheduled but are awaiting an executive. The community greenlight pools for December will be published on the fourth. That\u2019s on Monday and will end on December 28th. And this month, they cover DPI, WFIL, and WZEC.  ",

My name is Marvin, I\u2019m going to share my video. I am lucky and feel the immense burden of contributing to this community to build out this infrastructure for real-world assets. A bit about myself, I\u2019m originally from the Bahamas, a small island in the Caribbean. I\u2019m based primarily in Nairobi, Kenya, I\u2019m currently in Ethiopia, I travel around the African continent. One of the things I do and am passionate about is Raise, which we started two years ago. The goal is to build security tokens and real-world assets. If you know the Bahamas, you know it\u2019s the offshore entity tax haven; we don\u2019t call it tax evasion; we call it the offshore financial center. That\u2019s the fancy way of saying it. We thought 2019 would be all the rage for real-world assets, but we were very wrong. We decided to build a platform that simplifies diligence of real-world assets; we\u2019ve been making it for the past 2 years. It\u2019s finally in the right place now, and I\u2019d love to show it. We bided our time to build out infrastructure to do due diligence on companies before they would launch to eventually create a database oracle that would link to smart contracts. It seems like we\u2019re finally here, so that\u2019s what I do and how I spend my time. Otherwise, I\u2019m a securities lawyer by trade; I\u2019ve built out and designed legal systems in the past. I also spend a lot of time in the crypto community, and I\u2019m happy to be here.  Let me know if there are any questions. I\u2019d be glad to share the platform on the screen for a couple of seconds, so you get a sense of what I do daily. LongForWisdom: We can share your screen briefly.  2364\u00d71439 176 KB  Marvin: What we build at Raise is securities infrastructure for the African continent, which is where we focus on time and energy in the capital markets here. You\u2019re looking at a live version of the Raise platform. Two years ago, when we started out, the first thing we said was how does someone build out security token real-world asset infrastructure. The answer was evident to us. First, you have to digitize this stuff. Many people are talking about real-world assets, but many things don\u2019t even exist digitally; deeds are still paper-based, especially in Africa. The first step we started out with was digitizing it. You\u2019re looking at a live version of Raise; there are three components to the platform. We have one that\u2019s focused on organizing corporate structures and subsidiaries. I can find out an annual return for subsidiaries, documents, and board members we can track. We can see who is on the board and who is not on the board. Most notably, we structure asset data for private companies to see a list of shareholders and all of the different assets stored here.  3533\u00d71803 153 KB  For Yele Alade, as an example, we\u2019ll store his common shares; we know exactly how many common shares he has. Each shareholder is tied to an email, and we create an electronic share certificate for each of the different certifications. This visual representation of what you see in a centralized database stores asset data programmable assets for private companies. So we create for each one, and we store all of the rights and preferences. Basically, we digitize an entire corporate structure. What we started building out this year is basically a security token issuance platform.  3538\u00d71711 189 KB  This Cap Table that you see here is connected to something that we call a Deal Room. From this Deal Room, what we do for a company is we structure all of its diligence data. I can change up the different terms and add that it\u2019s convertible debt; since the Cap Table data is connected to the actual Deal Room, investors can simulate exactly what their investment can look like in the future. This is based on actual company data and all of the diligence data. The Cap Table is organized and structured in this deal room. From this deal room companies and documents and all this stuff that I can go on forever about, you can invite investors, and those investors come in.  3530\u00d71802 160 KB  After you\u2019ve invited them, they can invest in the company directly through the platform. When they invest, we update the Cap Table here and issue an electronic certificate. That\u2019s what the platform is currently to get a sense of. That is the context in which I think I will be a helpful fellow. We have a team that only thinks about securities all day; all I think about are real-world assets all day and hopefully how they will not disrupt the crypto and MakerDAO community\u2019s financial freedoms. I hope that was an excellent introduction to Raise and myself. Glad to meet everybody; thank you again for the time and the kind messages. LongForWisdom: I am looking forward to seeing the outcome of the fellowship. We are grateful to have you here. Thank you.  Vishesh Choudry The State of the Peg MCD System Stats MCD System Stats Alt DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs Maker Vault Stats 55:00 1276\u00d7612 119 KB  All right, we\u2019ve crossed over a billion DAI. Still around 430 million from ETH-A. We\u2019re up to almost 10 million from ETH-B. That\u2019s pretty much capped out. 3 million from BAT-A. 420 million from USDCA. A tiny amount from USDC-B. Up to 113 million from WBTC. 52 million from TUSD-A. Smaller amounts from KNC, ZRX, and Mana, and then 18 million from PAX-A and smaller amounts from USDT-A, COMP-A, LRC-A, 5.7 million from LINK-A, and 17 million from YFI.  1268\u00d7630 98.6 KB  Just to touch on where the DAI peg is and has been. We\u2019ve seen this consistent long-term price around $1.01 for a while. This has come down in the past month compared to two months or three months before, say, $1.06-$1.07. The peg has moved a little bit during specific time frames. We\u2019ve seen instances of a few large trades executed at significantly elevated prices. These are particular instances that warranted double-clicking on.  1266\u00d7578 75.8 KB  This one, in particular, is interesting. It turns out there is a particular transaction; the short answer is arbitrage. Still, a specific transaction is part of the series of transactions that exchanged many trades in the process. It exchanged 90 million DAI on Curve for USDC and then basically trading back that DAI. The top-level in this trade was a rather large flash loan and swap, which is basically a pure arbitrage opportunity that the trader was seemingly trying to take advantage of. Ultimately, that\u2019s something to double click on further if people are curious, but the long and short of it is that\u2019s what these blips are.  1272\u00d7590 55.2 KB  If we look, however, at the last 14 days or so. You\u2019ll see that this price has been fairly consistent, around $1.007. The other thing to note is that the volumes on that have been slightly higher in the last couple of weeks relative to a month ago.  1270\u00d7590 106 KB  There\u2019s been some amount of uptick in trading activity there. It\u2019s also a bit more distributed onto multiple different sources than prior or is a bit more dominated by Uniswap and then the secondary, DYDX.  1264\u00d7600 83.6 KB  What you see here is still the lion\u2019s share. Obviously, it\u2019s Uniswap, but we also see this decent chunk full of SushiSwap. DYDX seemed like a slightly diminished proportion of the trades. Then, Coinbase sees a very slight uptick even though it\u2019s a small amount overall for the DAI-ETH trades. The USDC graph echoes these price movements but with the trading dominance occurring on a curve.  1266\u00d7604 111 KB  If we look at some of these vaults, we see that for ETH, the largest liquidation wall right now is around 418 dollars with roughly 120 million DAI. If you see here, the largest single chunk of the ETH portfolio is 103 million, and that is roughly around 200 percent collateralized. Therefore, you see the most extensive ETH vaults; 56 million are the largest at 320 percent collateralized, 18 million at 380 percent collateralized. At least for this, the 70 million chunk at the top of the sheet (references both the 18 and 56 million vaults) is reasonably well collateralized. The highest risk scenario in the top few is this 17 million vault with 200 percent collateralization and at least two 13 and 11 million, respectively, at 200 percent collateralization. Beyond that, it\u2019s a bit of a long tail aggregation of vaults adding up to this column here (signals big middle column in the first chart).  1270\u00d7592 110 KB  For ETH-B, now we\u2019re actually seeing some traction in this. 2.6 million is the largest ETH-B vault with collateralization around 190 percent. It makes sense that we see lower collateralization ratios in this bucket. Still, there\u2019s kind of a curvature, which is interesting, and then there is a slight wall at around 380 dollars per ETH. That\u2019s a projected liquidation of 7.7 million. Nothing too crazy there, but there is clearly an appetite for these lower collateralization ratios.  1268\u00d7666 128 KB  Additionally, if we look here, you can see that there\u2019s a projected liquidation amount with a price of 1.00 or slightly above a dollar. The nuance of that is if we look at these vaults as has been discussed prior, you have a lot of vaults that are basically at a distribution of 100.1-100.8 percent collateralized. Some of these most enormous chunks, you can see from the table basically that even the top five to seven vaults there are added up, that\u2019s roughly 200 million DAI with 100.1 or 100.2 percent collateralized. And then, that continues throughout the smaller vaults. This is a situation that everyone is very clearly aware of. The total amount of DAI that is below 101 percent collateralization is roughly 400 million at this point. That is a continually growing situation, as was discussed over the last couple of months. I would say that the due date for crossing 100 percent collateralization is ever rapidly approaching.  1262\u00d7650 129 KB  As for WBTC, we see a chunk liquidation of 78 million at a 14.2 thousand price. This is just something to keep an eye on, especially as markets were a little more volatile in the last week or two. If there is a significant downswing, you could see large amounts of liquidations all at once. Part of the risk scenario is that there has been some rebalancing of collateralizations as the nominal prices of assets have risen. Obviously, people like to book profits, etc. There\u2019s been some perceived stability in those prices, so I think people have felt a little more comfortable adjusting accordingly. If it drops back down, then that\u2019s your massive liquidation risk scenario. Those nominal amounts of liquidations are huge in that the ratio of issuance versus market liquidity is probably very high right now.  1266\u00d7602 104 KB  For YFI vaults, this is dominated by one large vault. Most people are aware that\u2019s 10.2 million that\u2019s roughly 220 percent collateralized. That\u2019s your projected liquidation wall of 11.6 million at a price of approximately 19.9 thousand. That\u2019s something that could get liquidated very soon.  Questions and Comments  Frank Cruz: Hey, Vishesh, I guess we have an idea who these large votes are for the WBTC-A and the YFI. In other words, I would imagine there are large institutions, VCs, hedge funds, or crypto Twitter influencers that can load up, and it wouldn\u2019t matter if gas prices are 1000?  Vishesh: In terms of gas prices, we know that some of the usages of WBTC, for example, are managed positions through protocols, large companies, DeFi company issuance, etc. However, if the question is, would a potential crash event creating a bottleneck on gas cause issues with liquidations in WBTC or ETH? The answer is; it\u2019s possible. Especially if you consider the state of the market right now and consider that multiple different collateral portfolios have seen tremendous amounts of issuance in the last 90 days or so. You can also consider that gas prices are pretty high in nominal terms. If you adjust for inflated ETH price, those gas prices are lower, but that\u2019s been a discussion that\u2019s been had on crypto Twitter as well. The end result is in a crash scenario. If there is a crunch on gas, then yes, there is the risk of running into issues. Also, individual positions being managed positions doesn\u2019t necessarily mitigate that entire issue. For example, we saw for ETH, though a few large positions fall into some of these buckets. Actually, some of those larger positions are the better-collateralized positions. So you can see there\u2019s a mix. Some large positions are at 200 percent collateralization, but others are significantly higher. There would be a significant amount of  DAI liquidated if there was a market crash. I think if that occurred, there would be a crunch on gas prices, and yes, you might run into some issues. So, that\u2019s something to consider. Frank Cruz: Part of that question was if do you have confidence yourself, and this is your opinion of course, and no one else\u2019s, do you have faith that some of these large holders can find the courage and deposit more collateral? Vishesh: I do not know these large owners, and so I couldn\u2019t say. Frank Cruz: Got it, okay, cool. I guess my thinking is if Mnuchin wakes up on the wrong side of the bed tomorrow morning and decides to do some funky stuff, I think you said we could have a flash crash. I\u2019m just hoping that these guys can man-up and deposit some collateral.   Gregory DiPrisco: I would just keep in mind that we have the litter box set to 15 million DAI. Even if one of those large vaults were liquidated, the maximum amount of DAI that could get bid in that period is 15 million.  LongForWisdom: That would be an exciting 24 hours.   Vishesh: The realistic outcome you would expect long term is the same amount of sales you have to deal with. However, the initial impact is probably that if there was such a mass liquidation event, you\u2019d basically just have a bunch of stalled liquidations.  SamM PSM Implementation Update 1:12:19   Since last week, Primoz submitted his risk analysis as expected. On the smart contract audit front, Quantstamp has agreed to give us an express audit with a target end date of the 18th or the 19th. Hopefully, it will be the 18th. If all goes according to plan there, we should be good to push things out next week. Primoz also set up some risk parameter polls. Currently winning is the one with a 500 million debt ceiling for USDC only to start, and we add in some of the others later on in 2021. These polls don\u2019t close until tomorrow, so people can change their votes now. USDC has at least 50% of the weight in PSM deployments. Nonetheless, the spell is ready, the contracts are on Kovan, and we should be good to launch next week as expected. Any questions?   LongForWisdom: If 500 million or 750 million debt ceiling were chosen, we might consider reducing the debt ceiling on other stablecoin vaults?  SamM: Yes, Primoz put that up on contingent on over 500 million winnings. We would zero out the debt ceilings of the current stablecoin low collateralization ratio vaults. Makes sense to me. The PSM is strictly better. LongForWisdom: Cool, alright, any other questions?    Sam: One thing I forgot to add. When it gets deployed, an additional module called the LARP module will move the tin parameter from 1% to .1% over a week so we can maximize fee collection as arbitragers pick that up as it goes down.   Gregory: How exactly does that work, by the way?  Sam: When the executive spell is crafted for next week, it will launch the LARP module, which anybody can call. Depending on how far it is from the launch date, it will set the tin parameter lower and lower until we hit our target value of .1%. Gregory: Got it, thanks.    LongForWisdom: I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019d see market makers keep that relatively up to date so they would pay fewer fees using the PSM.  Sam: Whoever is arbitraging on this will want to code that in as they\u2019re arbitraging. The LARP is going through the audit as well.    LongForWisdom: Alright, one question that Greg brought up earlier was that we could potentially consider delegating the ability to do oracle whitelisting to the Oracle Team. I am not sure if we have time for a full discussion on that now, but if anyone wants to create a forum, I think Nik and I discussed it a few months ago at one point. If Nik is still here and has any thoughts, maybe he could briefly share them.  Nkunkel: I reserve judgment until the future.    LongForWisdom: Fair enough! Cool, we\u2019ll leave it there then. If anyone wants to continue discussions, feel free to do it here. Thank you, everyone, for coming!

My name is LongForWisdom; I\u2019m the governance facilitator for MakerDAO. I am joined by many people from Maker. However, it\u2019s slightly less than usual due to the impact of daylight savings time despite my reminders over the last few meetings. Hopefully, they\u2019ll drift in shortly. All right, so we\u2019ve got a shorter agenda than usual. This week, we don\u2019t have any presentations or specific segments, but there are a couple of polls this week. We have a couple of things to discuss, and so we\u2019ll go over those. Just a reminder that if you have something to say or you have comments on what\u2019s being said, please interrupt; it\u2019s honestly fine. We\u2019d love to hear from you. If it becomes a problem, then someone will let you know, but please err on the side of action. I\u2019m going to do the MIPs formal submission review for November. I have the regular segment from Vishesh for the state of the peg. Then we\u2019re going to spend some time discussing stablecoins again and potentially the flash loans stuff that happened the other week. Let\u2019s remind people about time zones. I\u2019ll go over the story once again; this meeting is set in UTC time, now at 16:00 UTC, so be aware that the meeting time may vary when daylight saving times change. Cool, all right, I\u2019ll get started with governance updates, then I\u2019m just going to go through governance at a glance. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Updates LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 01:51 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated.  We\u2019ve had several active discussions this week. Possibly the most active one was the thread I posted about reacting to the October 23rd executive. I highlighted some of the issues that I thought were created by the flash loan incident and opened the discussion. The change to increase the GSM pause delay passed, and it\u2019s now been increased to 72 hours, which will help counteract the risk from flash loans. I think that pretty much covers governance updates for the week so let\u2019s do let\u2019s get to the other domains and other weekly updates.  Discussions   Reacting to the October 23rd Executive  LongForWisdom highlights the issues created by the flash loan on October 23rd and opens the discussion to responses. So far, most responders favor taking no action. LongForWisdom: So far, most people seem to favor us taking no action, which is fine,. Unless we hear otherwise from several other people, we\u2019ll let the matter drop although, of course, we may have time to discuss it more in this meeting if people want to.    Governance - forget about whales  Planet X creates a write-up discussing some of the issues we\u2019re facing in governance and suggests some reasons that larger MKR Holders aren\u2019t voting. We had a cool post from Planet X, where he discusses some of the issues we\u2019re facing in governance as well as low participation. He suggests some of the reasons that larger Maker holders aren\u2019t voting and kind of summarize some nice takeaways, which I thought were good. This gathered some discussion, which was generally favorable. I don\u2019t believe Planet X is here, but that was a good post so thank you to him for creating it.    Discussion: Voting Incentives/Changes  FabianSchuessler revives a thread discussing changing the voting incentives, which triggers some further discussion on the issue.    Signal Requests   Should the Maker Community burn attacking borrowed MKR in the event of a governance attack leading to protocol redeployment?  LongForWisdom seeks to understand and communicate community sentiment around borrowed MKR and its use in governance attacks.    Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 03:56  This one\u2019s going to be quick because of the randomization for the work that we did last week, but as LongForWisdom just mentioned, the weekly executive for the GSM delay going from 12 to 72 hours has passed. The authorizations were removed from the oracle freeze module now, so we have no way to freeze oracle feed outside of waiting the 72 hours. Also, a phrase best promoted by Greg is \u2018in the box we trust\u2019 meaning that we can no longer trigger the liquidation circuit breaker. We\u2019re relying pretty heavily on that the box will limit our exposure to auctions not performing well. An update on the foundation, we\u2019ve been trying to come together with a few plans with regards to flash loans. We worked at a couple different paths and then sort of compared the pros and cons between each one of those. I think we\u2019re gonna have a proposal for everybody soon so that we can get both of those modules back in place and maybe even reduce the GSM delay again. Still, our solution should prevent flash loans in governance. Nothing for monthly stuff, obviously. There were two collateral assessments, which are almost complete. Sam worked on those but we have to still run them through, like static analysis and other types of tests, and then we\u2019ll post those. There\u2019s nothing to Kovan, although GUSD is ready, so I\u2019m gonna see if I can do GUSD to Kovan tomorrow. The DssGov executive is currently in review. This is what\u2019ll make spells a little bit easier to create. It\u2019ll also improve the documentation around collateral onboarding. There was a domain team review we did on MIP 27 for the debt ceiling instant access module. That\u2019s up for formal submission now. I covered everything else so, except this Friday\u2019s executive will have YFI and BAL and whatever other polling results have come out. For collateral assessments, we\u2019re still planning on uni, renBTC, and TBTC, and we have to review MIP 14, 17, and 25. The auditor discussions for liquidations 2.0 have concluded. Now we\u2019re just comparing them at this point.  Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 07:38  We\u2019re mostly dealing with testing the new model for evaluating risk parameters for all vault types. We ran a few tests. We already saw that MANA, for instance, currently doesn\u2019t have an appropriate debt ceiling, which is why we proposed a decrease last week. We should go into executive tomorrow. We\u2019ll see what kind of results we get for other assets, particularly those that were onboarded a while ago became less liquid in the last few months. BAT possibly also has a bit too high of a debt ceiling but, as I said, we need to run a few tests first. There are also pending collateral evaluations on uniLP, as I said, mostly trying to figure out how to value LP tokens and assign them volatility. That\u2019s mostly related to the impermanent loss actually affects price movements of LP tokens. That\u2019s in progress. The renBTC evaluation was also finalized by external analysts. They\u2019re proceeding with evaluating actual REN tokens as well. The renBTC report should be released soon, but there\u2019s one issue that we need to figure out. Which price or record do we want to use? We aren\u2019t sure if BTC-USD is the price oracle used for renBTC is actually a good price oracle. That\u2019s related to the potential new upcoming implementation of ongoing fees. This could affect the renBTC price on the market, which would mean our price oracle wouldn\u2019t fit well. There\u2019s actually no other price oracle except the one from Curve, which we obviously wouldn\u2019t want to use. Then, finally, the team that\u2019s working on the RWA side of risk is currently working on an asset evaluation model for NewSilver. The idea is to have an internal model for evaluating those loans used as collateral so we can have our own assessment of depth coverage, which in reality shouldn\u2019t hopefully be much different from the one provided by Centrifuge. And then for MIP 21, the off-chain asset-backed lender implementation, there\u2019s ongoing work for risk assessment of the whole implementation. More specifically, I think Sebastian is currently focusing on evaluating the credit tenant list space industry and assessing tenants that were proposed, which at the end account for a large amount of risk exposure in the proposed model. And that\u2019s pretty much it from our side. LongForWisdom: Cool, I think Chris maybe had a comment.  Chris: I was noticing that there\u2019s a price divergence between BTC and wBTC on the Ethereum network and that we\u2019re using the BTC oracles, and I don\u2019t know if that may factor into our calculation as well. Also, the same considerations we\u2019re applying to REN with their fee model, which I think is absolutely correct, we may need to also apply to wBTC because there\u2019s a not-insignificant number of wBTC to get swapped for renBTC to see them moved across the bridge. So yeah, those are two things to think about. LongForWisdom: Cool, yeah, I think that\u2019s a valid point.    Amy Jung Community Development Team Update 11:48  There is a poll in the forum to do a kind of podcast version of the governance updates. So if you guys have any feelings towards that, please put your comments in that post. We are launching our community development portal internally, as in facing this community tomorrow, so keep an eye for that. It\u2019s going to be really exciting. This is where you can go for educational resources around community development and programs that support how we can grow this community. We will have badges on the mainnet coming up in the next couple of weeks. We do have a super cool grantee, one of our grantees in Curadao, CuraDai, which uses digital currency backed by Dai. It is doing some really great things on the island of Curadao, check that out.  Charles St. Louis MIPs Update 13:19 1222\u00d7682 103 KB  So this month, we have quite a bit of proposals coming through, like last month. Mainly four MIPs and three sub proposals.  1224\u00d7716 125 KB  We have the emergency voting system, which replaces MIP 5 created by Davidutro and Jtathmann. We have the flash Mint Module by Sam, which was voted in last month via a declaration of intent, and this is the follow-up technical implementation for it. We have the debt ceiling instant access module to modify the debt ceiling in a more automatic fashion. And, lastly, we have MIP 28 the operational support domain definition. We have calendar exceptions, specifically removing the December governance cycle due to the potentially less active community during that month. This helps make sure that no proposals get lack of participation due to people being away for the holiday season. We have Sourcecred funding to continue on that initiative, which is really awesome. Lastly, we have the sub proposal to onboard Amy as the operational support domain facilitator.  1224\u00d7664 97.2 KB 1232\u00d7724 147 KB  Inclusion polls have a particular threshold of three thousand MKR. The \u2018yes\u2019 votes for them have to be greater than the 3000 MKR plus \u2018no\u2019 votes for the proposals to proceed to the next stage of the governance poll followed by the executive.  LongForWisdom: Cool, great, thanks Charles. We can spend a little more time talking about some of those proposals, but first, I\u2019ll just confirm that all those seven submissions will be moving to inclusion polls next week. I think they\u2019re all fine. So there\u2019s maybe a couple of things we could perhaps discuss in terms of those proposals. We can just potentially discuss calendar exceptions because, especially now that the DAO is expanding, there\u2019s more stuff going on. It makes it harder for everyone to keep up during holiday periods. While they\u2019re all worldwide holiday periods at all sorts of different times, the community does seem to be mainly focused on the US and EU, which share the Christmas and New Year holidays; Basically the winter holidays. Does anyone have any thoughts in favor of or against these, such as specifically not doing things on those dates or thinking that we should carry on doing things on those dates? Charles: Right, even apart from the MIP itself, which talks about the December governance cycle, there\u2019s also the question of the weekly cycle, specifically at the end of December and, also at the end of November for Thanksgiving, which I think is on the 26th which falls on Thursday. I imagine that most of the US people will not be present for that meeting which makes the question of whether we should have it considering that that\u2019s most of the domain teams. Chris: Yeah, I\u2019m okay with not having it.   LongForWisdom: Does anyone else have thoughts?  Frank Cruz: Does this mean that RWA is not coming into fruition before December 31st? Maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding. LongForWisdom: For Real-World Assets, I think it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019re going to be in this year, but I could be wrong. S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Yeah, we are working full time on onboarding those from the risk perspective, but there is also some smart contract work to do; it\u2019s the first time\u2026 Chris Mooney: On the smart contract side, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s really going to hold us back as far as governance red tape. So we\u2019ll just be working on the code from now until whenever it\u2019s ready. If it\u2019s in a weekly cycle, in theory, it could land before the end of the year code-wise, but then there\u2019s a lot of other work that needs to be done in the real-world to line that up. So I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be ready by the end of the year, but the code easily could be.   Frank Cruz: Cool, and with regards to DssGov, is that something that\u2019s a 2021 event as well?  Chris Mooney Yeah, that\u2019s definitely going to be 2021 at this point. I think we worked out the rough timeline for DssGov with the MIP cycle if we don\u2019t have a December cycle and, If I\u2019m correct, I think it was January for the RFC. Then you\u2019d have February for the formal submission, so it could go live along the lines of February or March. Something around there. Charles, go ahead and correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Charles: Yeah, so I mean there\u2019s a couple possible avenues you could take if you were to submit it for RFC over December or at any point during November. It would fulfill its requirements after a month of being in review with that one week, in the end, being a frozen period where no changes can be made, so technically it could be potentially implemented by the end of January, but it depends when it\u2019s submitted for RFC and that RFC period is one month. Chris Mooney: Okay, that\u2019s good to know maybe we can come up with something by December and speed it up a month.   Frank Cruz: Charles, if the community wanted to also include incentives into the DssGov contract, does somebody have to generate a MIP, or how does that work?  Charles: From the MIP perspective, or MIP author perspective, once this proposal enters the RFC period, it\u2019s when community members can provide any feedback and ideas for consideration to the author of that proposal, so it\u2019s up to them to ultimately include any changes that the community suggests. If they do think that incentives could be worked in, they could make the changes to implement that. However, if not, then that proposal would still go forward when they formally submit it. So it\u2019s up to the author to make these decisions. Of course, working with the community is encouraged, but yeah, does that answer your question, Frank? Frank: Yeah, yeah, so I guess what I\u2019m saying is if we want voting incentives to be coded into that DssGov contract, do we wait for the foundation, or do we as a community take the initiative? Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of things we got to figure out; The game theory and the economic theory. There are different ideas on the forum, but I\u2019m just wondering if we\u2019re gonna have to wait to liquidations 2.0 to get incentives or if we could get it going in 2021? I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking out loud. Charles: Yeah, I would. If Chris or anyone else working on DssGov wants to chime in, I would say that you can make your case in the comments and provide possible solutions for them to consider once it\u2019s in RFC. But yeah, it\u2019s ultimately up to them to include whether they think it\u2019s achievable or not. Chris Mooney: Yeah, I\u2019ll say we haven\u2019t put a lot of thought into incentives on the technical side so, although there are a number of us that are sort of fans of thinking about this, if you guys want to come up with a couple options and have the whole community figure out exactly if there\u2019s going to be incentives what they should look like, it would be ideal to have that while we were before or during the RFC period so that we could figure out how we wanted to handle that. Frank Cruz: Cool, thank you.   LongForWisdom: Yeah, I would say that I think the incentives side and the potentially having some sort of option for a vote lockup are both reasonably important. I\u2019m hoping to pursue making those changes in DssGov. If the community members also want to see specific features, then yeah, just watch out and make sure you make that known.  Juan Collateral Call Update 26:00  This week, we did not have any call as our friends in the US had significant events, so we figured that it was better to skip and not compete for attention there. Next week we\u2019re going to have Paperchain. For those that don\u2019t know Paperchain, they do analytics on the streams for Youtube, Spotify, and whatnot for artists and labels. They can anticipate how much revenue they get, so based on that, they advance part of the revenue. They are working with Centrifuge, and they will be coming to present their drop token and their project. If anyone wants to join us next Wednesday 11th at 6PM UTC.  ",

                    "content": "Procedural LongForWisdom November MIPs Submission Review 27:54  LongForWisdom: This week, we saw the poll for the stablecoin action plan fail by 50.38% to 49.60 %, so maybe we can spend a little time discussing the various options for stablecoin builds, kind of in the context of this whole failing, and perhaps highlighting what the proposed option was and discussing the other options. Does anyone want to give a brief summary of the option that was presented?  Sam: Sure, I could do that. Basically, 3 options were presented. Option 1 is to increase the surplus buffer and having this currently unbacked DAI cancel out in the surplus buffer. The second option is to turn off the stability fees sometime in December when it hits a 100% collateralized ratio. The third option is to turn off the stability fees and set the debt ceilings to zero on all the stablecoin vaults on December 11th. Thereafter, we create new mirrored elk types for all of these, which have the same parameters but different debt ceiling and stability fees set up back to what they were before. This is the start of a rollover into a new vault type option. Because it failed, my instinct is to move on next week to basically put a rank choice poll up and go wide and see what people want to do about this because we do have to do something. We do have to pick a plan. It\u2019s not something that we could just start burning MKR and not deal with. That\u2019s my view. I\u2019m glad to hear anybody\u2019s thoughts on that.   JoeQ: I just want to step in and reiterate that we have to do something, no matter what, even if it fails along the way a few times, we have to figure a plan out.  Greg: I think we could keep increasing the surplus buffer. It seems really easy. Sam: I think we will need to go to another vote. LongForWisdom: I agree. We need consensus on whatever option we\u2019re going for. I think that ranked choices are probably the way to proceed, given that it was all we had this week. Whether we want to or not, I don\u2019t know if there are other options or how feasible.   Chris: What world is most granular here? We get some amount of MKR burned for the assets that we\u2019re making fees on because that\u2019s important both to release that DAI supply from the fees into the markets so that people can repay their vaults. It\u2019s also important to build up the system safety net in MKR. I\u2019m sure that MKR holders like that burn as well, but those two primary reasons are two good reasons to continue to have some MKR burnt. What gives us the granularity where we can handle both the stability fee increases from stablecoins to have the sort of capacity either in the surplus buffer or have some amount of flap options that we release the other stuff into the general markets? Would that be the rollover option?  Sam: Yeah. Chris: Unfortunately, with the rollover option, there\u2019s a lot of additional overhead that we have to think about. I mean, that\u2019s a lot of additional stuff. There are more keepers, more ilk types, and a lot more engineering that goes into that, but it\u2019s not terribly difficult. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a strategy that we\u2019d want to pursue. LongForWisdom: I think the complexity with that strategy is that it requires us to adjust the surplus buffer to burn some MKR at some point but not too much. And then increase it as well as maintain some ratio via updating it at good times, right?   Matthew: I have a technical question that\u2019s kind of related to this. Just humor the scenario where we continuously increase the buffer. Whatever it is now, we just slowly ratchet it up, and ultimately we get it; just humor it to 20 million. All this issue goes away because of whatever external event happens and then we decide we want to lower it back down to 2 million. Am I correct, or am I wrong? Would that mean that if we lowered it from just say 20 back to 2 million, we\u2019d have to ratchet it down slowly to not trigger a monster of either minting or buying back of MKR? Is that correct?  Chris: Yeah, We\u2019d have to ratchet it down slowly; otherwise, you\u2019d just instantaneously release a ton of flap options, which would probably create an enormous amount of market pressure on MKR, which would likely push up the price quite a bit. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, though. Matthew: It\u2019s just something that we should all be mindful of, that if we take this thing from 2 to 4 million to 20, just as an example, that when we want to take it back down to 2 million as an example, then we\u2019d have to have to include some interim steps so we wouldn\u2019t cause a price squeeze.   LongForWisdom: It\u2019s worth noting that if we were on that route when we liquidated the vaults which are below collateralized, the difference would come out of the surplus buffer, between their current collateralization level and like 100%, so the buffer would decrease by some amount when we announce those liquidations.  Matthew: I\u2019m not implying that there would be liquidations. I\u2019m only commenting that let\u2019s assume that all the DAI that would be in the buffer would be legit and good. None of it would be classified as bad debt since everybody paid off their vault. What would be in that buffer would actually benefit the Maker burned. We would just need to be mindful not to slam it back down to avoid an MKR purchase tsunami. LongForWisdom: I agree with you we should never drop it down by a large amount. I don\u2019t think the scenario you\u2019re hinting at is likely given the current situation. To ensure that the DAI in that buffer is all good DAI that we actually have, we need to liquidate the vaults below collateralization. If we have vaults that are below collateralization, 100% collateralization\u2026   Kurt: If I can, I\u2019d just like to throw a monkey wrench into that scenario as well for people to think about. If we do end up with, say, 20 million of the legitimate surplus, is the best use of that by buying MKR, or should it be invested back into the team or infrastructure to focus on growth or onboarding real-world assets actions like that? It\u2019s not clear that the buy and burn are incredibly economically efficient from a DAO success perspective.  LongForWisdom: Yeah, I think that\u2019s a good point that touches on a completely different issue, but it\u2019s definitely worth mentioning.   Chris: You want MKR holders to be incentive aligned the right way, so MKR holders probably do need a bit of a burn to target success in the system. I agree with Kurt that part of targeting that success is to fund teams. It also solves the problem of the deeper scam in the fiat monetary system where the debt that we\u2019re accruing needs to be on the market so that people can repay their loans; otherwise, we\u2019re going to see upward pressure on the peg. So at some point, we\u2019re paying teams, or we\u2019re putting that DAI on the market to burn MKR that pressure relief felt needs to exist both for the peg so that you can kind of balance the accounting for DAI. Even if we pay teams, in theory, those teams would eventually offload that DAI in the markets, which is exactly what you want.  LongForWisdom: I think this plays into the concept of strategic reserves and the declaration of intent for which went through recently. If we want to maintain margin levels of reserves, it may not be good to do it in DAI but maybe with something else.   Kordez: I think one of the issues is that we don\u2019t have a mechanism where we could actually take the fees in the surplus, the ones from stablecoins and then the rest of the fees. Its kind of 50/50 now. I think 40000 per day comes from crypto collateral and another 40000 from stablecoins. So, if you could take 40000 from crypto collateral we could spend that money for other MKR burn or for teams or whatever but this would only be done if we had the flapper distributor, but this would be very useful to solve the issue that Chris mentioned, still spend the DAI for this stuff and on the other end save DAI that might not be collected at the end.  Sam: And also keep in mind, if you want simplicity, we could just turn off the fees once we\u2019ve captured most of the value. That\u2019s always available. LongForWisdom: Yeah, I think that is the simplest solution to just turn off the fees. Obviously, the downside is that we do lose some of that value in the vaults. Matthew: You lose the value for the people that show up now after you do that. LongForWisdom: Yeah, for any vaults that are still above 100% collateralization. Sam: I mean, if we could hit 90%, the vast majority of the vaults are underwater, and around this sort of bleeding edge, so we would be able to capture a fair amount of the value, and yes, we\u2019d miss newer vaults, but there are tradeoffs, right so is it worth the effort of going for option three or continuously increasing the surplus buffer? Just something to consider. LongForWisdom: Yeah, it\u2019s definitely a nontrivial amount of governance work to align these plans. Even if governance is split between multiple plans, it means that you run the risk of us being partially through implementing the winning plan and having part of it fail. Then you have half a plan, which is no longer valid, or you implement the first half. When it comes to doing the second half, you can\u2019t get people to agree, so there is some risk level, especially if there\u2019s no firm decision on one of the plans. Kurt: If it becomes impossibly hard to reach some sort of consensus on this, we could always just put 3 different executives into the chief and let MKR holders decide directly within its own chain. LongForWisdom: Yeah, I supposed the front end supports keeping Maker on the old proposal now, right, so maybe that\u2019s doable? But the danger of doing that before has been splitting the Maker on the hat, right? Kurt: I think with the new front end support, it\u2019ll be fine. I guess the trick becomes, at what point do people concede to defeat? That could become tricky. Maybe I retract that suggestion without thinking it through a little bit more. LongForWisdom: Yeah, it\u2019s definitely a possibility. Kurt: You could always pick the one that looks like it has the most consensus and just has a stated plan of record. If this doesn\u2019t pass in a week, we\u2019ll put the next one up and then the next one, so then it just takes longer, but you don\u2019t have this splitting votes three ways kind of thing. LongForWisdom: Yes, that\u2019s fair. As I mentioned, I think the next step would be doing a random choice vote with the various options. I think that\u2019s the obvious next step, and hopefully, that could result in something that has a consensus. Still, if not, then we\u2019ll have to think about other solutions to get an agreement.   Chris: I\u2019ll add one comment just so people think about this as well, we\u2019ve been thinking about this sort of happy path, but everyone remembers we had a 500000 surplus buffer that liquidated itself in 20-30 minutes on black Thursday, that exists as an emergency protection and we could find ourselves in a similar situation where auctions are suboptimal or for whatever reason we end up losing that surplus buffer. It\u2019s just worth thinking through that unhappy path like now we have all that bad debt built up in these stablecoins, and we\u2019d have no surplus buffer.  LongForWisdom: Yeah, that situation could be quite bad in terms of governance, assuming that we take the path where we\u2019ve let the vaults go into 100% collateralization, and the DAI is sitting in the buffer collateral type, and that buffer disappears to match the bad debt from ETH and then we\u2019re in a situation with no surplus buffer, DAI is not backed 1:1, and we have to decide whether to liquidate stablecoins at a loss or mint MKR until the DAI is fully backed again. Neither of which are particularly good choices, doing that does have some risks.   LongForWisdom: On a positive note, let\u2019s move on. Any other points? Maybe we can focus on action points at the end. I would like to see more discussion in the forum instead of just reiterating options and confirming that it\u2019ll go up as a ranked-choice vote. I think that makes sense as the next step, yet maybe we could have a more thorough discussion about the various options and the various tradeoffs.  Other Presentations and Updates Vishesh Choudry The State of the Peg MCD System Stats MCD System Stats Alt DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs Maker Vault Stats 45:55  So, just to overview where we\u2019re at, We\u2019re still at around 955 million DAI minted. We have about 345 million of that is from ETH, half a million is from ETH-B, 3.3 million is from BAT, 401 million is from USDC-A, 100 million is from wBTC, 56 million is from tUSD, a little less than half a million is from MANA, 23 million is from PAX, and about 4.8 million is from LINK. DAI is sitting basically the same price since the last week or so. The DAI price has been holding roughly $1.01. If we look at DAI-USDC, trading volume has been pretty light, but the prices have been sitting pretty steady at 1.01. The latest is at $1.008. These prices down here of about $1.006 are roughly as close as DAI seems to get to the dollar mark.  1015\u00d7346 63.5 KB  If we look at the long-term price graph, you can see that there have been moments where it gets close to touching around August 13th, September 3rd, September 19th. At these points, it hit $1.003. More or less, this is extremely consistently sitting between 1.012 and 1.007, occasionally 1.006.  995\u00d7397 98.3 KB  In terms of DAI-ETH trades, it echoes the same thing, if not a bit more consistently. At the very least, that average price is always $1.01, except at the end of October. When the ETH price was surging, a slight dip in the DAI price recovered itself. Then in the last week, it has been sitting around that $1.01 price.  988\u00d7354 62.3 KB 1004\u00d7421 58.9 KB  DAI-USD is a similar story in terms of the big picture but a lot more volatility in the prices of those trades. In the last week or so, though, it\u2019s still kind of looking a bit more consistent matching what DAI-USDC has been doing. And then DAI-USDT always pretty much tracks DAI-USDC.  3459\u00d71840 282 KB  In terms of where all that DAI is sitting, it\u2019s still pretty much 280 million or so in Compound, another 200 million in Uniswap, a solid 63 million in BarnBridge, and other fifty or sixty million in the top few Curve pools. Then there\u2019s also 15 million on Binance, 12 million on another Binance address. So in terms of how DAI is being used, things are looking pretty consistent with how they were prior. And in terms of price, the trading activity seems pretty consistent with its being doing in the long run.  1006\u00d7100 44.7 KB  In terms of the individual vaults, if you look at the ETH collateral portfolio, the largest bucket of ETH debt is roughly 190% collateralized, so we see here the top few vaults are 290% and 312% collateralized. This is good news because the couple of largest positions that account for 64 million of the overall debt are roughly 300% collateralized on average, which is pretty solid.  827\u00d7201 56.1 KB  There\u2019s 13 million collateralized at 190%. It interestingly seems to drops back down to this 188% collateralized mean. There is a decent percentage of smaller vaults that are 188% collateralized, which is very interesting.    These two buckets represent those two largest vault positions. In terms of liquidations, right now, ETH\u2019s price at $318 has a pretty large liquidation wall of 90 million DAI. This is a conversation regarding the degree of liquidity out there. The degree of a buffer we have in the event of, say, 100 million dollars of DAI is liquidated. Because at this point, the overall DAI supply, not just on ETH, but also on all the other collateral types, probably far outweighs the amount of surplus and/or liquidity sitting out there on DAI. So in the event of a massive liquidation, even though it may not be particularly large compared to the total pool of DAI debt, it could still have a pretty large impact on DAI or surplus and bad debt.  3442\u00d71679 188 KB  LINK has one large vault that\u2019s 4.2 million and 280% collateralization to touch on some of the other vault types. Again it depends on expectations of market volatility for LINK price as to whether it is safe. You can\u2019t necessarily judge the same collateralization ratio for two different collateral assets the same way. In ETH terms, that\u2019d be a very safe collateralization ratio, but it\u2019s a bit more of a judgment call on whether or not you think it is for LINK.  3449\u00d71677 205 KB  Let\u2019s look at some of the larger stablecoin positions. For USDC-A, basically, 378 million still, which is pretty much the exact same number that we talked about last time, is sitting at 101% collateralized. Hence, we have a decent chunk of the collateral portfolio that\u2019s 100.5% collateralized currently. These were 100.6% last week, and then I could do a more granular breakdown there. Still, another decent chunk is 100.5, 100.6, and 100.7% collateralized, respectively. Then 100.6 is one of the largest means in terms of the breakdown of these buckets. You can at your leisure poke around at some of these positions and see that for yourself.  3449\u00d71681 208 KB  In terms of the 56 million, basically, these are not terribly distributed. Only about 21 to 27 million among the few largest positions. Though its kind of the same story is USD-C in terms of these being 100.5, 100.6, 100.7% collateralized. So it\u2019s kind of more the same. I\u2019d consider this additional 56 million pool as another problem to consider.  3448\u00d71691 201 KB  PAX is another meaningfully sized position. Of the 23 million, you have roughly 21 million that\u2019s in the four largest positions. You have two of them, approximately 15 million, approximately 100.5% collateralized, so not exactly the same scenario as some of these other ones. You still have this other 3 million vault that\u2019s 101.9% collateralized, so I would say roughly 16 million in PAX-USD debt, similar to what\u2019s going on with USD-C right now.  3443\u00d71680 243 KB  And then the other significant position to keep an eye on is wBTC. The largest bucket of wBTC is roughly 200% collateralized, and that\u2019s about 78 million of it. Of the largest positions, it\u2019s pretty representative. Look at the 2 largest wBTC positions. You\u2019ll see that the first accounts for 77 million, which is 200% collateralized. The next largest is 17 million, which is 340% collateralized, which is pretty solid. 200% collateralization based on expectations of market volatility for BTC price, you can consider whether 200% is safe or not. Obviously, there\u2019s lower market volatility for this than for ETH, but that\u2019s the mean for wBTC. I think that\u2019s it for collateral types for now. I can go back and double click on anything that anyone wants to see more of.  LongForWisdom: Thank you, that was awesome, very thorough as usual. It\u2019s definitely interesting seeing all the ratios and the different vaults and how they vary and stuff. That\u2019s interesting. All right, anyone has any questions for Vishesh?    Discussion  Frank Cruz: What\u2019s the history of that wBTC vault? Is that the institution that opened it a while back? Vishesh, do we have any history on that ETH address?  Vishesh: Yeah, I can pull up for you the, so I\u2019m gonna add in the individual actions that were taken on each vault position so people can sort of look back and see, for a given collateral type, what\u2019s its history, but this, the largest two positions because they do kind of juggle between them, one of the largest two positions has not changed significantly I think pretty much since wBTC started that was one large institutional user it is also slipping my mind right now which user that was, but I can find out for you and let you know.   Frank Cruz: Cool, so this is kind of normal behavior for the right, to be under 200% collateral and\u2026?  Vishesh: Yes, so these positions have been sitting around a similar collateralization percentage for a little while, but the 47 million one that was updated on the 26th and the 30 million dollar one interacted with their vault on the 24th. It hasn\u2019t been a significantly long time since they at least interacted with the Vaults, so you know that they\u2019re managing or keeping an eye on those positions. Frank Cruz: Ok, yeah, Primoz said that it\u2019s either Alameda or a Nexo. Primoz: Yeah, I\u2019m not claiming that; it\u2019s just that I think the third one is probably a Nexo. I think you can even check it and Etherscan. The two largest ones seem to be Alameda, but I\u2019m not claiming. I can just see they\u2019re kind of involved in farming, sushi swaps, and this kind of stuff. So it might be them, which is on the one hand good because we\u2019re kind of sure they have systems in place to defend against liquidations. They have DAI. It\u2019s kind of positive usually.   LongForWisdom: Alright, cool, any other questions for Vishesh?  Open Discussion 1:02:41  Cool, alright, that pretty much brings us to the end of our planned agenda items. Does anybody have any sort of more general questions or anything they want to ask or discuss before we finish? At this meeting, I mentioned the flash loan stuff from the other week. Is anybody interested in talking about that? Does anybody disagree with, so I might mention that the thread\u2019s prevailing opinion appears that we should do nothing? Does anybody disagree or agree?  Nkunkel: I don\u2019t necessarily disagree, but I would like to kind of take the devil\u2019s advocate position here. We are letting the impact of a vote happen on the system where the vote wasn\u2019t legitimate. so there is a precedent that we\u2019re setting here that technically the b.Protocol guys shouldn\u2019t be whitelisted right now on the oracles because that vote was never ratified legitimately, right? So from a pragmatic point of view, what would happen here? We would do a vote to like un-whitelist them and then say you can reapply, and there will be another vote to whitelist you again, and if that passes, they can then we\u2019re back to the same spot we are now. Now, personally, I don\u2019t want to do that. I think that\u2019s a lot of work. Still, I also don\u2019t like the precedent that we\u2019re setting here in terms of saying this vote was illegitimate. Nevertheless, we\u2019re just gonna go along with it and just twiddle our thumbs instead. It seems kind of wrong in retrospect. LongForWisdom: Yeah, I think that\u2019s a fair point, and it\u2019s probably a good summary of my views on it as well. Anybody else has any inputs? Chris: Yeah, I mean, I struggled with this a little bit, I mean, we\u2019ve known about the flash loan risk, but I think when Nick is saying illegitimate, you know, I think it comes down to saying that the intention is that Maker voters have skin in the game and I think we all agree that that\u2019s sort of the right incentive mechanism for Maker and this violates that premise and so you could say this violates the intention of what we wanted and that\u2019s why the vote doesn\u2019t seem legitimate. However, this was a known risk, and the code did allow it. The DssChief is much older than flash loans. I mean, that voting contract was written long before flash loans were a thing, so there may be a kind of code is law argument here as well. We say okay. You know it happened. this has been great. Now we just take proactive actions to make sure that the system better codifies what we all agree it should codify regarding the future\u2019s intentions. So that\u2019s my thought on it. I don\u2019t even know if I would go as far as to say the vote wasn\u2019t legitimate. Still, I definitely don\u2019t feel like I can make a strong argument on it. Like I said, it feels as if it definitely violated intentions. The surplus buffer was also part of that vote, so that would mean the surplus buffer would need to drop back down to two million if we resolved it in the future.   LongForWisdom: Yeah, good points, the point that kind of gets me sticking on is what Nick mentioned about precedent, right, wherein this case the vote was something that in general everyone thought was a good thing, everyone kind of wanted for b.Protocol to be whitelisted on the oracles, the poll was in favor, the executive, I\u2019d like I cannot hesitate to say that I suspect it probably would have passed maybe not this one but in the future, if we put it on again which we probably would have I suspect it would have passed, but in the future that might not be the case, this might be something that\u2019s far more controversial, it\u2019s possible but if you think about the black Thursday compensation vote, if this had happened on that vote I suspect that we would be overturning it as a result or at least re-voting on it, so the point that worries me is that we\u2019re doing something different based on the content of the vote rather than based on the intentions of what should have happened.  Chris: If it makes you feel better, I\u2019m probably in the minority on this, but I was fine with whitelisting b.Protocol, but I wanted to see some of the slack taken out of the MKR dilution before us increasing the surplus buffer, I did a \u2018no\u2019 vote on that executive for that reason, and so it was passed in a way to me in a very illegitimate way, but I\u2019m at peace with it because the code was written so that it could happen and I don\u2019t know if anyone is more offended about it than me based on the content of the vote I don\u2019t know. Matthew Rabinowitz: I would even go further and just say yes, it violated the spirit of it but in the same way we have laws about you can\u2019t put up a poster of something insulting or something defamatory against somebody, and then later someone says well I didn\u2019t put up a poster, I just wrote about it. That\u2019s still a violation of the spirit, but one is slander, and the other is liable, so the solution is let\u2019s just defend against it and move on. Chris: Fully agree. LongForWisdom: Yeah, I think that\u2019s the intention, right? We\u2019ll just try to protect against it in the future. The danger is that it happens again before we get a chance to happen, which would be not great.   Juan: I wanted to add something to what Nick said. There are two different topics, and one is a little bit of the precedence that we might be setting and that I won\u2019t say that if it is too much work. It\u2019s not that fruitful to just reverse everything and do everything again. Yeah, we might set that precedent, but at the same time, if we do everything necessary to protect the protocol and make sure that this does not happen again. We make it clear that we are not in favor of this with different techniques. LongForWisdom mentioned, and he put up a vote in the forum for burning the Maker used with bad intentions, so that could be one of the ideas, for example. Still, I think we might need to separate the message we\u2019re sending with things such as with Long\u2019s proposal. The other one of just reversing everything because it\u2019s the right thing to do. If we have too much work to do and grow the protocol in different ways, I think we should not go for the reversal. It\u2019s my personal opinion.  LongForWisdom: I think that\u2019s kind of a good point. To some extent, this kind of played into why I posted that thread. Because at the very least, by sort of making this a discussion and making it something that we talk about in terms of what are we going to do, we set the precedent that we don\u2019t just automatically say that it\u2019s okay, right? We do at least discuss the issue, discuss the incident every time it happens hopefully, and decide again based on the individual situation. So yeah, I\u2019m hoping that helps a little bit, but we\u2019ll see. The signal you mentioned, Juan, is specifically related to burning Maker in the event of an actual malicious attack, which results in the Maker protocol being redeployed. So, unless something catastrophic happens, an emergency shutdown is called, or whatever, wouldn\u2019t apply to the issue that we saw on the 23rd, which was just a group pushing an executive proposal over the line. That\u2019s kind of again a different situation.   Juan: And maybe to keep going on that topic what you\u2019re proposing, or well I don\u2019t know if you were proposing it, Long. Maybe you want to remain neutral, but you didn\u2019t seem to have an opinion there or at least you didn\u2019t make it public. However, that seems to hurt people lending their Maker instead of whoever\u2019s performing the attack. I don\u2019t know if we want to think of different ways of deterring people from trying it, but maybe that\u2019s something else.  LongForWisdom: Yeah, I mean it sounds kind of bad when you put it like that, but that\u2019s kind of the intention of the signal, it\u2019s that if you are lending your Maker and it\u2019s used to attack someone, then the harm will fall on you rather than necessarily the person that is actually making the attack because the fact is that if you are lending Maker and then an attack happens then, that attack wasn\u2019t possible without the lent Maker necessarily which then shifts the responsibility around slightly. Juan: Yeah, I commented on that. On average, I think the lending Maker\u2019s API is 0.56 percent last time I checked, so I don\u2019t believe that people are lending Maker for that API. I think they\u2019re doing it to belong Maker and use their capital for other things. Whatever it is, I don\u2019t know. It could be even buying a car or paying down part of the mortgage, so I think that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. I don\u2019t know if we should be punishing people that are using the capital for something else, so that\u2019s why I was a little bit torn between punishing them and not. LongForWisdom: Yeah, I mean that part of it makes sense, right? They can use the capital for a lot of things. And this is where it gets a little complicated. We could allow Maker to be used as collateral in the Maker system, which has the advantage that it can\u2019t be then re-lent out to someone else. Of course, that introduces other risks in terms of something such as the circularity of the Maker token and decreasing prices. So I mean, almost the ideal situation is for another lending platform to offer Maker as collateral but not lend it out that isn\u2019t like the Maker platform or the Maker protocol. Juan: But I don\u2019t know if it makes economic sense for any platform to just accept Maker and not lend it out. It\u2019s as if you only have one side of the platform. LongForWisdom: Yeah, it may not. Avid does it with its own token. They allow users to deposit it and use this collateral to borrow things. Juan: I don\u2019t know if people have anything against and I\u2019m asking because I honestly kind of think far enough, but what would be bad things about having a sort of Maker inflation, so if you deposit Maker in the vault, you\u2019re earning I don\u2019t know one percent API on your Maker, I think that might help, I don\u2019t know.   LongForWisdom: Yeah, I think Frank mentioned voting incentives earlier in the call. I agree that\u2019s one of the advantages of having voting incentives because that incentivizes people to keep their Maker locked up in the governance contract rather than having it elsewhere. Right, I think we\u2019re maybe reaching the stopping point for this meeting. Does anyone want to make any final point or reminders or anything? Alright, looks like no. I think we\u2019ve had some positive discussions this week both on stablecoins and on the governance flash loan stuff, which is great. As always, the place to continue these discussions is in the forum. So if you have any comments or think of something else that you want to make public, please use the forum threads.

We have got a bit of a light agenda today, we will go through what we can. My name is Long For Wisdom, and I am the MakerDAO Governance Facilitator.   This meeting is open; feel free to interrupt if anyone has a comment.   Deeper discussions happen in the Forum.   Governance LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 1:43   Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread: If you have the time to read over and vote in the active threads, that would be much appreciated.   Governance wise, no huge news. Mostly focused on keeping things going and address the fact that the forum is becoming busier. Trying to make things more readable and accessible by tweaking settings and categories - any suggestions are welcome!   Discussions   Why are people so afraid of unbacked Dai?  Latetot asks why people are so afraid of unbacked DAI, which prompts some passionate responses. If you have an opinion, please leave a response on the forums.    Poll: What should we do with the system surplus?  Aaron_Bartsch makes an informal poll to ask what Maker Governance should do with the growing system surplus. Lots of interesting comments along with the poll results.    MakerDAO Foundation Funding: Call for Financial Transparency  latetot calls for more transparency from the Maker Foundation around the cost of operating the domain teams required to keep the Maker Protocol growing. No official Foundation response at this time.    Unwinding Stablecoin Exposure  Primoz speaks about some of the options available to start unwinding direct stablecoin exposure, especially regarding Dai\u2019s newly minted supply backed by stablecoins. Please check it out!    Signal Requests   Should we take a more flexible and transparent approach to onboarding collateral?  LongForWisdom posts a signal request on behalf of all the mandated and soon-to-be mandated actors, asking about a more flexible and transparent approach to the collateral onboarding process. Charles made some posts talking about this last week. Encourage people to vote on that.    Should we print 100M DAI to buy ETH?  bit asks whether DAI should be minted in order to buy ETH, which could then be used to partially back said DAI. bit has been around for a little while and seems to propose stuff that is counter to the general community consensus and sentiment. I want to call out that it is good for people to this, as it helps avoid groupthink as the status quo.    MakerDAO Standard Governance Processes  I wrote a brief overview of the Maker communities current operating governance processes, including signal requests, declaration of intent, and MIPs and why there are three processes of govern things and the benefits of each one.    Help Wanted! Scientific Governance and Risk Call Summaries  Finally, Davidutro is looking for people to help with the governance call summaries.    Help Wanted! Work with Primoz on the Risk Team  Primoz is also looking for a person who is interested in building Risk Monitoring Tools and working with the Risk Domain Team.    Weekly Updates Cristopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 07:15   Last week, we crafted that final spell, and we increased the global debt ceiling to 1.1 billion; that is pretty noteworthy.   The USCDA collateral type changed to 400 million, with a 101% collateralization ratio. We did that for TUSD, PAX, and USDA, so all of them are at 101% collateralization ratios. TUSD also had a 50 million debt ceiling, which effectively creates this Peg on rails. So it would be anomalous unless we hit the debt ceiling that DAI would break above Peg at this point. I would imagine it would only be the debt ceiling, or we would limit or exhaust the supply of those stablecoin assets before that happened.   The base rate was still at zero. We updated the TUSDA adapter\u2019s implementation, and I think they were up like 43 million last time I checked, so that is impressive. We replaced the Gitcoin feed address for MANA-USD so that they can update that price.   We worked on a collateral priority framework. The governance group, Sam M, and I put a little bit of effort into that. Sam is now part of the grants program, so he works with the smart contracts domain team on our technical roadmap. We put a little bit of work on the collateral priority framework, but I think other people have ideas, so we are meshing that up, and we will present that to the Community at some point.   Sam also finished working on the flash mint module, so we had a couple of comments on that, then he updated those, and we will deal with that next week.   Next week, we will probably end up code-reviewing that module. I want to review the MIP21, which is a technical MIP for Real-World Assets, and maybe see if we can flesh that a little bit. I think that Lev and Matt Rabinowitz have been working on that. It looks like it is pretty far along, and I am reasonably excited about what they have done so far, so we will see if we can get that forward.   I do not know if this is in the forums yet, but it will be at some point today. The TUSD people need to upgrade their implementation again to fix a problem with their legacy TUSD ERC20 token, and that will probably end up having to go through emergency. Next week, we will review that code, and we will need an emergency MIP to update that implementation because otherwise, around 43 million TUSD will be locked in that adapter.   LongForWisdom: Is there any chance of getting them to update at a time that helps us in terms of executives?   Christopher Mooney: Yes. They are very much willing to work with us on that. So much of their users are now in that collateral adapter that both they and we are interested in not disrupting that.     Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 11:35   In last week\u2019s executive, we had WBTC get whitelisted in the LBTC oracle just in time for their launch. Good for them that they managed to launch successfully.   This week, we had a bunch of polling votes. One of them was to change the ETH-USD data model. To reiterate, the data model is how we source the prices and how we process them to reach our canonical oracle price. The volume landscape has changed over time, and we just wanted our new model to reflect that. That passed.   We had a bunch of whitelisting proposals\u2014one from DDEX for the BTC-USD oracle. One from Open Networks, which is like an options platform using the V1 oracles that we shut down, they were caught out, but they had not let us know what they were even using it. What we did for their whitelisting proposals was wire up the medianizer V1 into the current medianizer V2. What that means is that we whitelisted oracle\u2019s V1 and oracle\u2019s V2, and now Open can continue querying the V1 oracle. Otherwise, they are completely screwed because they have many options expiring in like a year from now that are hardcoded to use the V1 oracle. That passed.   yEarn Finance wanted to get whitelisted on the BTC-USD oracle for their new YBTC Vault, so essentially, anyone can lock up BTC or some kind of wrapped BTC in their Vaults. It would go and open up a Vault in Maker, lock up that BTC, borrow Dai, and then use that Dai to earn yield. Furthermore, the yield they earn is then converted back into BTC, and this way, their users can earn a BTC yield on their BTC.   The last proposal was from Kyber. They have some promo token that they used as a pseudo stablecoin during their hackathons, and they need their ETH-USD oracle for pricing that. So they made a whitelisting proposal as well, and it looks like that one passed.   From the domain team side, in terms of collateral onboarding, last week, I submitted the onboarding assessments for PAX G and YFI. Those are up. If we get the other domain teams to submit their onboarding assessments, we should do these two pretty soon.   Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 15:55   There is still ongoing work on collateral evaluations on our side. The bad news is that our emergency version 2 will not be released until October, which might be a little bit late for us to make a proper collateral evaluation in due time. Instead, we might do another asset.   We made a poll this week to increase the debt ceiling on stablecoins and vote, which gets the 200 million increase, so this is going straight into tomorrow\u2019s executive.   We also published three posts.   One was on ETH-B Vault. There is still a discussion for it, but I suspect Aaron will soon make a poll to vote on the actual parameters within the upcoming days to potentially implement ETH-B Vault in the executive in about two weeks.   There is another post made by myself that LongForWisdom mentioned regarding onboarding Farm-related tokens. The idea is to unwind stablecoin exposure and charge much higher fees than we are charging now for something like USDC.     Finally, I am very close to finalizing the new rates setting approach, which will probably be posted on forums in a few days, so stay tuned!   Charles St. Louis MIPs Update 18:11 1440\u00d7801 189 KB 1435\u00d7797 166 KB 1438\u00d7798 168 KB 1437\u00d7801 328 KB 1436\u00d7812 139 KB 1438\u00d7805 179 KB 1437\u00d7806 217 KB 1438\u00d7800 229 KB 1435\u00d7808 186 KB Discussion 27:45   Matthew Rabinowitz: One quick question - is that change in the process something that\u2019s permanent, or is it scheduled with a set expiration and then getting re-implemented?   Charles St-Louis: It is not a permanent change; it can change over time. The current process is optimized for a long-term state of collateral onboarding, which takes a lot longer for review. Moreover, when the system is ultimately healthy and running, well, nothing is permanent. We can change based on the needs of MKR holders and how the mandators feel concerning collateral onboarding, much like MIPs. Things are iteratively improving, as I mentioned. That is a long way to say it is not permanent.   LongForWisdom: I can maybe speak to this a little bit as well. In the long-term, we are probably going to want to move back to a monthly cycle. However, for the time being, it is causing too many problems or too much frustration.     Frank Cruz: Is the public priority a poll, an on-chain poll, or just a forum poll? Furthermore, are the domain teams all right with having to rush this a little bit? Are they not going to be overwhelmed?   Charles St-Louis: We are still finding out the details on where the prioritization framework will be hosted and maintained, but you can think of it as a public spreadsheet with all the collateral greenlight assets with scores next to them based on the different metrics, which will also be there to see. That is how it will look, and I think it is a question of maintenance, on how much time it will take the domain teams to do that, but those details are still being figured out.   Christopher Mooney: I can speak to the second part of that question. At least for the smart contracts domain, we will not do anything unsafe for the Protocol. We would enjoy the agility to ramp up and get more collaterals added week by week. There is also a weird flow. I do not know if you have ever done any engineering, but to prepare something and work on it and then finish and then get randomized onto something else for the next weeks and then have to come back at the end of the cycle. It is tough to get all of that state back in your head. This should make things more continuous; it should reduce the number of risks and bugs. So I think the smart contracts team is happy with this change.     Jon: I can speak a minute about the emergency response MIP. The purpose of that was to standardize or have a framework to - dog barks - Sorry, I might have to skip this. (leaves).   Juan: I can comment on the Collateral Call. Yesterday we had Stani and Marc from AAVE present their token. Their application is on the forum within the MIP6 application section. We also had Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss with the rest of the team from Gemini, Eric, and Marshall, if I remember correctly. It was an exciting call. You can check the video; it\u2019s already on the forum, and Gala works on the notes. Next week, on September 30th, we are going to have the Real-World Assets working group meeting. So if you guys can meet Sebastien and Lucas and Matthew Rabinowitz, please feel free. There is already a working group in the forum. If you want to get involved with that, please go ahead. And then, the week after that, October 7th, we are going to have Brian from CACHE Gold and Matt Luongo from the Keep Network presenting TBTC. The agenda is already on the forum. Going back to the collateral and the forums, I think Amy just posted the link on the chat about the exciting positions with the target, so ideally, everyone can help reach these goals. Furthermore, the forum post from Charles explains all the modifications that he just summarized; they are quite interesting. Also, please vote for the signal request posted by LongForWisdom, and signed by all the domain teams.  LongForWisdom: Thanks for continuing to run the calls. They have been beneficial.    ",

No reason for it not to continue to the executive next week, on Monday to be specific. Expect that on Monday.   I wanted to take this segment to discuss the Collateral Onboarding changes in more detail.    Discussion 2  Collateral Onboarding Changes 34:22   Nik Kunkel: Oracles are a bit unique in how the work scales. The biggest thing with the Oracles is not the implementation of code for each unique asset. It is not insignificant work but its not the majority of the work. The majority is compiling that into a package for the new Oracle infrastructure, testing that extensively, and then the actual deployment. We want to be comfortable rolling it out. We have 26 feeds, each need to update individually, and for some of them, they need more time than others. They need head-sup, they need help troubleshooting, and there is a huge time penalty going through that process multiples time over. The best way to do that is to batch multiple into the same cycle, with multiple assets incurring the testing penalty once.   Switching to this more weekly ad-hoc cycle for collateral onboarding will change things in some ways. On the one hand, it makes it for the risk and smart contract teams to be more effective by not limiting them to get something done on some early date within the month to get into the monthly cycle. From the oracle perspective, it does not help that much - we still do not have the flexibility to work on the assets we want every week. The changes do not give us flexibility since the testing and deployment cycle are three weeks.   Given that we do not have the arbitrary dates anymore for deciding to do XYZ, it should be possible for the Oracle team to do 6 or 7 assets at once, incur that testing and deployment penalty, and then in terms of the rollout during the week, the Oracle team can operate in massive bursts and work ahead of the backlog with the rest of the teams catching up. When the other teams catch-up, we can also do another big burst of about 5-10. That is how I see this impacting my team\u2019s ability to deliver     Christopher Mooney: Once that work is happening with Oracles, risks and smart contracts can continue working on things like the FE collateral type because we already have the Oracles for that. That frees up our ability to work on things. If we know this process blocks Oracles, we can prioritize different OC types with slightly different parameters in that window of time. As long as we already have Oracles for them.   Primoz Kordez: On the risk side, it is less related to testing and deployment, but more or less related to the number of people working on collateral evaluations. Before, Marco and I worked on them, and now a few more volunteers are working on collateral evals. I do not think weekly cycles should be a problem for us since we have 4-5 analysts working and can finish it analysis in one week if one person works on this full-time   Frank Cruz: Simple explanation/example: I put together a MIP 6 application for Pickles and another one for Coinbase token. The application goes on the forum; who determines the rating of the asset? How would Coinbase token go through the process and be a collateral type within, say, two weeks? Can someone give me the ELI5 on that?   Nik Kunkel: We are saying that it cannot be for two weeks. To have an Oracle in production for this would need at least three weeks if I started today. In terms of agility, if a new token comes out today, we cannot be more productive in onboarding that. The time benefits that we are getting are that there is no arbitrary date at the beginning of the month by which we have all of the work done and have it in the MIP cycle by the end of the month. The current system requires everything to be in by, say, the 5th, in order to be able to be ready for on-chain changes by the end of the month. If you were to miss the deadline, even by one day, you would have to wait two months instead of that one month. That time is not being gained by productivity, but rather by the deadline set-up.   Juan: To add to that, Charles mentioned that the collateral onboarding framework would allow for a transparent system for demonstrating how the teams are working and how recourses are allocated. This will show a clear path in terms of saying how the energy/bandwidth is being focused. Circling back to Amy\u2019s post, every domain team is looking for more people to help and augment the bandwidth.   Niklas Kunkel: If you want more collateral types, we need to onboard more domain teams. With this new grant funding system, the best way forward is to find those quality people who can come on and work. At first, there will be a trial period to make sure people are doing quality work, but if we need more collateral onboarded, we need to onboard more people.   Frank Cruz: This is also a great way to progress toward decentralization   Charles St-Louis: Juan has demonstrated interest in this, but it would be great to have more recourses - guides, tutorials, walk-throughs, videos, regarding how collateral is onboarded and the thinking behind why we have these categories for assessing them. Explaining this on camera to demonstrate this visually will help give people an idea of getting started when applying for a collateral onboarding grant. This content can let people learn initially without having a one-on-one with the domain teams, which will get more people involved in collateral onboarding and speed up the Dao\u2019s decentralization.       LongForWisdom: The actual prioritization of the asset classes (AAA, C, whatever) is the domain teams working to figure out the potential impact of all options. It is also figuring gout how difficult that collateral type will be to onboard, how much Dai it is expected to generate, and some other high-level metrics to figure out how worth it is to prioritize it. This would be part of this prioritization framework and would feed into the ranking to determine the best bang for-the-time buck for the domain teams.    Segments  Vishesh Choudry  The State of the Peg MCD System Stats MCD System Stats Alt DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs Maker Vault Stats 47:15  1056\u00d7457 185 KB    Total DC availability of about 1.2 million is right now for Dai, sitting around nine hundred million Dai, a massive issuance.   The state of this for ETH is around 340 Million Dai issued.   BAT is about 3.5 million Dai.   USDC-A is at 385 Million.      1023\u00d7119 53.1 KB   82 million Dai from WBTC.   1021\u00d7557 266 KB    Back down to 5,000 from USDC-B.   50 million Dai from TUSDC.   Smaller amounts from KNC, ZRX, and Mana.    1051\u00d7222 112 KB    30 million Dai from PAX-A.   Small amount from USDT.   SFs for these are still sitting for 0% for ETH, 4% percent for TUSDC and BZRX, 4 percent for BAT, USDC, WBTC. Another USDC vault is at 50%, with 4% for TUSD, KNC, ZRX. 12% for Mana, 4$ for Pax, 8% for USDT.   Tremendous amount of issuance from stablecoins. People are still willing to pay 4% fees, and for the short-term, there were instances of people willing to pay 50% for USDC-B, though that is more of a short-term usage. Even smaller amounts were issued from Mana at 12%. For stablecoin usage, it does not seem to make a significant impact on what the SF sees; at 50%, the calculus changes quite a bit, but from 4 - 12%, it does not seem to be a substantial deterring factor, and we have seen many issuances late.    1018\u00d7413 183 KB   Peg wise, we have seen a comparatively flat Peg around 1$. There are moments of movement with ETH price relatively flat or falling a bit during the past week. Not a lot of movement both in terms of collateral and in terms of yield farming opportunities. There were no considerable changes in the available yields and even show some reductions in some of these platforms\u2019 positions.   1051\u00d7359 100 KB   If we look at the USDC pairs, the DAI-USDC demonstrates decreased variability in some of those prices and smaller volumes. The 15th and 19th show large volumes traded on Swerve (DAI-USDC) partly associated with yield farming opportunities driving that value. Afterward, they resumed trading heavily on Curve and sitting at around $1.01.   1052\u00d7383 178 KB   DAI-USD echoes with more price variability, sitting at $1.01 but with crazy spikes in those pairs on Coinbase and Kraken.   933\u00d7408 88.2 KB   DAI-USDT shows similar curves to DAI-USDC.   1055\u00d7547 78 KB   Dai supply, overall (and this does not include PAX and some of those newer collateral types), demonstrates a jump in the amount of issuance from USDC and a flat or small reduction in ETH, and then WBTC is sitting around 82 million, which is a smaller utilization percentage than the total amount issued than prior. That is just because that goal post was moved, and there was slightly more issuance there.   1061\u00d7525 131 KB   If you look at where some of this capital is, a massive amount of Dai issued is still being used for farming. I wanted to revisit a slightly older stat, which is the amount supplied on Compound. When this all kicked off, it was a massive share of what is going on. That has risen in nominal amounts. However, in terms of the percentage of the supply listed on Compound, it a smaller percentage. Roughly 280 million excess Dai is sitting on Compound, but now that there is 900 million total Dai minted, Compound accounts for a smaller amount where Dai is sitting with more supplied to the yield farming pools Balancer, etc.   1069\u00d7303 248 KB    In terms of the vaults, for ETH, we have those few largest vaults accounting for a considerable percentage of the overall Dai supply. If you look at the top 3 vaults, one for 40 million, one for 31 million, and one for 13 million, on a collateralization basis, these largest vaults were at a lower CR than the previous week. We saw the collateral rebalancing against the ETH price; those CRs did improve, although a couple of them were unchanged.   Overall, what we saw was the total collateral pool getting riskier because even though it was more leveled out between 150%, 200%, 250% prior, there was a smaller bucket that was 150-200% collateralized.    1060\u00d7337 100 KB   Basically, there are more risky positions, but some of the largest vaults are just as risky or less risky than prior, with overall increased risks.   956\u00d7308 56.7 KB   Looking at the liquidation walls, at an ETH price of $280, you would expect 80 million Dai to be liquidated, which corresponds to a few of the largest vaults. At $230, that is where some of these smaller vaults come in. One hundred fifty million Dai liquidated at $230.    974\u00d7233 224 KB    WBTC vault, obviously a tremendous amount, is 150-200% collateralized. They are 170% collateralized for the largest few positions, which accounts for a massive chunk of the total percentage supply because you have 3, 4, 5 large vaults accounting for a massive chunk of the WBTC Dai issuance, and for $8,900, you would see 60 million of that liquidated. That is one large wall. USDC is similar\u2014one large wall.   If there is a move in USDC price, there will be a whole collateral pool liquidated. Since we have 385 million Dai sitting in the USDC vault and 30 million in the Pax vault, that liquidation position is a binary risk. We have had this conversation before, and are seeing it again, with 30 million Dai from the PAX vaults.   The Dai supply has been, in large part, monopolized by stablecoins. This is something to be aware of and means that the Community should be discussing what level of binary risk we are comfortable underwriting.   LongForWisdom: It is worth noting that liquidations are turned off for all stablecoins except for Tether.  Vishesh: With liquidations turned off; there is an interesting mechanical process to resolve. In the event of a disruption in, say, PAX or USDC, there can be a discount on the market for those assets. You basically have a massive amount of under collateralization all at once, even though the liquidations are not actively being undertaken. I am not sure if the Community has quite figured out the mechanical plan for resolving the liquidations if they are halted.       Open Discussion  Stablecoins, Dai Supply, Liquidations, and Risk. 1:00:15   JoeQ: Question, what is a good way to measure risk as we increase SF on all of these stablecoins. How much should we increase the SF on these yield farming stablecoins, and how do we determine the risk?   Vishesh: This is an old topic in a sense, as it has been heavily discussed in the scientific governance process. We had a strategy of setting parameters of discovering demand/supply curves for Dai in the past. You can engage in a similar analysis to determine the impact on the demand for stablecoin vaults, especially considering that the supply issued from those vaults is pretty steady.   For example, if you raised the USDC-A SF, you would theoretically see very soon/clearly whether it impacted demand. By and large, my sense is when someone is chasing a 700 or 1000 percent yield, they are not sitting there thinking: do I pay 2, 4, or 6% a year? I would not expect SF\u2019s to impact the amounts issued in stablecoin vaults significantly. There are stupid amounts of supply chasing stupid percentage yields. I think a 4% fee is negligible in that sense.   If you want to try to raise that as a method, I do not expect a specific impact. The question is, how much risk are you underwriting on a binary failure case for a 400 million Dai pool? The answer is that the SF is likely a lot higher than what the costs are right now if you are  Even if you look at ETH at 0%, everyone can see that the risk is not 0%. I cannot tell you the exact percentage to reduce the issuance amount, but increasing git would unlikely to impact the stablecoin issuances.     LongForWisdom: Considering LR is set to 101%, the most fees we can get for those vaults are 1%. It would be best if it were to happen at some time and not immediately. At 4%, we take that entire 1% in like three months.   Vishesh: Let us say you have a 10% fee and a large vault that accrued fees that drove its collateral ratio below the line; how would you want to resolve? There is an entirely non-theoretical scenario where we have to resolve those vaults\u2019 liquidations while the liquidations are turned off.   LongForWisdom: I think we have to hope for Liquidations 2.0 before we have liquidations.   Chris Mooney: I think we will discover a reasonable price now, with the box. We may have to turn liquidations on, put 15 million into liquidations, and then turn them off again. I think there is a significant paradigm shift, as it does not make sense to discuss SF\u2019s with the CR this low. People will walk away from these vaults. They will get their 1% and abandon it. This will come down to MakerDAO deciding on turning on liquidations when we go below Peg. I would argue we do not want SF because fee accrual will push them under Liquidation faster. I do not think it even makes sense to put a fee on that because that gives us more control in the future.   Kurt: Those fees can be a little misleading since the fees will accrue into a surplus. On paper, it could look like a large surplus, but no one will cover those fees, and it will turn into bad debt upon liquidation. This will make accounting a little bit confusing.     JoeQ: But, even on liquidations, people will know that they buy USDC at a 13% discount, then people will do that nonstop.   Kurt: Well, the liquidation penalty does not affect anything here. It just is about the amount of Dai that the system targets in the liquidation. It does not affect the amount collected, which is determined by the market price.   Vishesh: In terms of market price, if the auction occurs on stablecoins, they would occur for a discount. We can also talk about what that discount will be, but nobody will be on an auction if it were not discounted.   Kurt: Well, all the discounts someone is likely to get on an auction like that is whatever the required percentage decrease is between bids. The parameter is called the Beg. The liquidation penalty does not affect what you get.   Chris Mooney: Yeah, and the discount is probably going to be R when it finally happens. I do agree that liquidations 2.0 will be better at this.     Akash: If liquidations were to happen for these stablecoins, let us think from the Market Maker perspective; they would buy USDC, convert it to USD, and if liquidations are going on in USDC, how do they convert that back to Dai? Does anybody have the answer to that?   Christopher Mooney: They would have to buy Dai in the market.   Kurt: Do you mean convert USDC to Dai or USD to Dai?     Akash: I am just trying to close the loop. I think there is an additional problem if USDC were to go into liquidation. The nice thing about having that USDC-A Vault is that it is a way for if an ETH auction happens, you buy the ETH, theoretically you sell it on Coinbase for USD, you take that USD, and you convert it to USDC-A, and now you can mint more Dai. My issue is, people should think about that whole circle of if you are trying to liquidate USDC-A, the Market Maker at the end has to convert that back to Dai in some sense. That is where I am having a little trouble understanding what the implications of that are.   Kurt: Let us try to think it through. You are a Market Maker, and you buy in an auction some USDC by giving Dai. So now you have got USDC, and what are your options? You can sell it on the market for Dai or put it back into a USDC Vault and generate some Dai under the assumption that you will be able to unwind that position over the coming days or weeks. Are there any other options? Akash: I am trying to warn you that you can sell the USDC for anything you want. I guess that is easier to sell for Dai than USDC.     LongForWisdom: I think the point is that it is not great to liquidate them when the Dai price is still above Peg, right? That is the takeaway.   Primoz Kordez: Yes, that is the idea. I mean, you would not be liquidating those Vaults and doing this recycle because you would be just having the same USDC exposure, so you should be doing this when Dai price falls and demands trends a bit. And then, once you acquire it, you see it is easier for you to buy Dai because there is no push anymore on the demand side. As Long said, you would be doing this, and liquidations would be triggered once you can achieve lower demand on Dai, once you achieve a lower price. Furthermore, this is how keepers can buy back into Dai once they acquire USDC.   Nik Kunkel: Once we have liquidations 2.0, it should help quite a bit because you can effectively do like a rollover where, as long as you have debt ceiling and you have liquidations 2.0 enabled, you can borrow USDC or PAX or TUSD, borrow some Dai, liquidate one of the Vaults, instant-buy the thing because there is a Dutch auction, dump what you were purchasing on the market and pay back the flash loan, all in a single atomic transaction. And all of what you have essentially done is just slightly clip the Vault\u2019s losses and created new Vault, which will probably have the same problem, you know, X amount of time down the road when the stability fees catch up.     Akash: How many USDC Vaults or how much notional is there that could theoretically become bad debt because of fee accruals? Does anybody have a sense of how much that is in terms of the number of Vaults?   Christopher Mooney: My intuition of this is that it is all of it. At this point, I do not see why you would maintain a USDC-A Vault at all. I would take the maximum amount of USDC; I\u2019d take the max amount of Dai against it, and, with a 4% accrual in the very next block, it would take itself under collateralized and ready for liquidation. Right now, I do not see the value in holding it, so I think it is fair for us to assume that all of the USDC-A Vault debt ceiling is ready for liquidation. That is, in reality, not the case, but that can be the conclusion.   Primoz Kordez: I think the number is 200 million.   Nik Kunkel: That makes the most sense because it is completely profitable to take the maximum amount of leverage possible, right? As long as Dai is above the $1.01 Peg. The USDC debt ceiling keeps growing by X amount of millions per day because as soon as we tick over $1.01, someone does this flash loan transaction to knock it back down. To make a profit, it abandons the Vault, and on top of that, they keep the put option, where if Dai ever does drop below $1.01, they have the option to pay back the Vault and make even more profit.   Vishesh: I am just looking down the Vaults list because I can sort by collateralization ascending. There is this stupid amount of USDC-A Vaults that are below 101%, so it would be a huge chunk of Dai liquidated if that was enabled.   Christopher Mooney: Instantly, we would ingest up to the box limit. So we would fill the box at 15 million, and then if we had to, we would turn liquidations off on it again.   Vishesh: It also confirms the hypothesis that these are not being maintained, and it makes total sense because there are no incentives to maintain them.     Christopher Mooney: I am glad we have this discussion because it is a pretty significant paradigm shift from what we are used to, so I am hoping everybody understands it.   JoeQ: I think that Gregory Di Prisco has a point, in the chat, that we cannot wait too long on this or else it will end up being a bigger problem.  Christopher Mooney: Yes, I like the idea that if we are under collateralized in USDC-B, that we can test the liquidation there. We do not have to turn on liquidations and see what happens with 15 million; we can craft a spell that does the liquidation and do a few to see how it would look like in the auctions.    LongForWisdom: I think Chris is right; this has been a positive discussion.   Primoz Kordez: I want to mention one thing: it is not entirely true that all of those Vaults are going to be unwinded. Just imagine there is 15 million DAI made tomorrow from some pool asset. I cannot say which one, but let us imagine, the price would go below $1.01, and the Vault owners who supposedly abandoned their Vault would, of course, buy it, so they would close their Vault because they would get some additional money back. So, it is not sure that these Vaults are going to be abandoned. If it can reach the price to fall, which is due to an oversupply, those Vaults would unwind because there is arbitrage again. However, speculating on 50 or 100 million Dai from other sources, it is a bit harder in the short-term. Maybe through some farm assets.  LongForWisdom: Thank you, Primoz. I think we will leave that discussion there, for the time being, because we are about 20 minutes past. Any final comments or reminders?    Matthew Rabinowitz: Yes, I extended a Q&A on Real-World Assets that are going to start probably in a three-minute break after this call. I will put it in the link in the chat.

My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m the governance facilitator at MakerDAO. I\u2019m joined by a bunch of Maker related people and anyone interested. We\u2019ve got our usual agenda today and a couple of segments as well. As for the preamble, if you have comments, questions, or want to interrupt, please do. Someone will let you know if it becomes a problem. We\u2019d love to hear from you, so please don\u2019t be shy. All right, I\u2019ll just briefly go over our agenda. I\u2019m going to cover some administrative stuff related to this call and Governance. First, we\u2019re gonna have the usual weekly updates from the Domain Teams. We\u2019re going to have the MIPs governance cycle review for November a little belatedly. Then we\u2019ve got segments from a couple of people; We\u2019ve got Derek, who will do a walkthrough of the DsChief version 1.2 migration process. Sam will give us an update on the PSM implementation. Finally, we\u2019ve got Spin or Lucas from Centrifuge, who will speak about RWA\u2019s prioritization. I guess I\u2019ll kick us off with a list of administrative things I had mentioned. A couple of weeks ago now, I thought I put up a poll asking if we wanted to both move the time of this call and potentially leave the call open after the recording ends. I don\u2019t think anyone was against leaving the call open after the recording ends, so I\u2019m happy to start doing that. In terms of the time, I think there was a majority to move the call one hour later, so I think we will be going ahead with that. If anybody desperately wants to stay at the same time, please go and vote in that poll. It\u2019s just an informal poll on the forum. If we do end up doing that, we\u2019ll probably do it starting sometime next year because I want people to notice that the call time is changing. Ideally, this will give a couple of weeks of notice. I think we\u2019ll plan that for the 7th, which I believe is after the first call in January. Unless the poll changes in the next few weeks, we\u2019ll move it to one hour later, 17:00 UTC beginning January 7th. I wanted to mention the other administrative point was Governance over the winter holidays, which ties into what I just said. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be having a meeting during the weeks of both the 21st and 28th. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be having weekly governance cycles as well. We\u2019re unlikely to get a large voter turnout on the 24th. On the 31st, which is the date that the polls would end, I feel that people are going to be busy with family and things. In addition, having these calls is rather pointless because everyone\u2019s going to be away. I\u2019ll remind everyone again next week but just be aware that the Scientific Governance and Risk Call isn\u2019t going to occur on the 24th or 31st. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Updates LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 04:03 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote on active threads, that would be much appreciated. Discussions   On the Priority of real-world assets: where do we stand?  Lucas from Centrifuge comments on the prioritization of real-world assets in the Maker Protocol and asks what else MKR Holders can do to get those assets prioritized. LongForWisdom: Lucas from Centrifuge has started a thread on RWA\u2019s priority, talking about where we stand currently and asking what else Maker holders can do to prioritize those assets. This drew some debates. We\u2019re going to have Lucas bring up that debate later in the call as well.    Introducing DssGov Rewards  Hexonaut introduces Rewards\u2019 implementation for MKR Voting and asks for feedback from governance in this direction. LongForWisdom: We had Sam McPherson create a thread talking about DssGov rewards describing a potential implementation for rewarding users that lock MKR in the governance contract.    MakerDAO accounting and implications  SebVentures describes the accounting in the Maker Protocol and starts a discussion about its implications. LongForWisdom: Seb from SebVentures posted an interesting post about MakerDAO accounting and its implications on the DAO and protocol. I thought this was very interesting as well as a recent discussion. Therefore, we\u2019d encourage people to check those out if they have a few spare minutes.    Signal Requests   Adjust ETH-B Debt Ceiling  Ultraschuppi signals on increasing the ETH-B Debt Ceiling.    YFI Vault Options  Primoz describes some of the options for the YFI-A Vault and asks for the community to weigh in.    Adjust YFI-A Debt Ceiling  Ultraschuppi also signals to increase the YFI-A Debt Ceiling.   LongForWisdom: I hope people are aware that we\u2019re in the middle of migrating to the new Governance Contracts. I\u2019m anticipating Chris will give us a rundown of that in a moment. We\u2019ve also got a few polls and actions scheduled for December, next week and the week after, and then executives on the 11th and 18th.  Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 06:42  Let\u2019s do last week first, and I\u2019ll take a brief pit stop in DsChief when we get there. Obviously, we didn\u2019t have the weekly executive the previous week. We missed it because we needed to arrange some of the UI stuff to smooth the governance transition. That went out on Wednesday, and then it finally garnered enough votes and was scheduled, I think this morning, depending on your time zone. It was scheduled a few hours ago. But recall the 72 hours delay, which probably means that with the office hours modifier, we aren\u2019t going to be able to cast it until Monday during those EST office hours. This part is pretty critical, so for the time being, we want to make sure that everybody keeps their MKR on the hat. We don\u2019t want to transition over to the new system. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the UI. It\u2019s probably not that big of a problem but let\u2019s just make sure that the old chief stays secure during this transition.  Lev had reached out this morning, and this is a pretty palm-sweating migration. There\u2019s a lot of anxiety and worry. We have a bunch of tests that validate this works in Kovan and in the mainnet. Still, those are simulations of what reality will be, so I think our confidence is high that this will go just fine. However, you can\u2019t know for certain. If anybody else with smart contracting skills has a stake in the protocol and cares, please feel free to validate that the mainnet chief will do what it\u2019s supposed to do. In that case, the old chief is disabled after the transition. The new chief is anointed and capable of passing executives. Otherwise, we will have a radically governance minimized protocol, and that\u2019s not good. Monday, once we are all cast on the old chief, it will be disabled. The new chief is capable of taking people migrating over. It needs to be launched, so we\u2019ll have everybody on Monday start to move over to the new chief, and we have to garner 80 thousand MKR to launch it. Once it\u2019s launched, the hat will be secure with that 80 thousand or more MKR. We can then continue with the executives the way we have been going, except this time without the flash loan risk. That was my detour into the DsChief. I\u2019ll also mention in the executive that we moved the GSM delay. A few stakeholders came together and just thought about the risk balance of having a GSM delay that was too short versus one that was too long. We\u2019re balancing risks about setting that parameter in opposite directions for 48 hours, which ended up being where we collided. I think we could lay out all of those arguments at some point and let Governance choose precisely where they believe the right risk balance is. Maybe we can recycle that once we do it, but this won\u2019t be until a new year. For now, the GSM delay will be 48 hours after this has passed. Does anybody have any questions about the migration DsChief 1.2?  Derek: Yeah, Chris, DsChief hasn\u2019t passed yet. It\u2019s very close. What passed a couple of hours ago was the ETH-B debt ceiling spell that had this 72-hour pause on it. We\u2019re approximately 69 thousand MKR, and I think the governing proposal has 83 thousand at the moment. So we\u2019re close, but\u2026 Chris: Yeah, we\u2019re close. People, please keep moving your MKR over and voting on that new chief. I misunderstood the conversation that we had this morning. I didn\u2019t realize it was the old spell that had passed. Derek:  No worries. It took me a while too. With the delay on there, we have overlapping spells. It\u2019s a tricky one, but I think your comment still stands that Monday is probably the expected time for it to be executed with the office hours on there. Chris: Okay, cool. Any other questions about the migration? Anyone thinks they want to independently verify that the spell does what it says it does?   In regards to collateral assessments, we\u2019ve finished UNI. AAVE is still in review. We\u2019re going to add a few little things to it, and then we\u2019ll push it out, but the deadline for that right now is Friday. The AAVE assessment is almost complete. Every other assessment that we needed for the end of the year is finished, except for tBTC, which was moved over. We\u2019ve done renBTC and Uniswap v2 for wBTC-NF. We didn\u2019t do any collaterals in Kovan last week because of all the Chief work. There\u2019s still the Dssexec lib that needs a review. We also did a little bit of work in the collateral onboarding sheet to assess RWA\u2019s priorities and where they fell on the sheets. For the domain teamwork, we posted about the GSM delay. I made some updates to the schedule post for the end of the year. Sam is still working on the PSM. There\u2019s been a lot of activity around PSM. For the coming week, we have the collaterals going to Kovan, which we\u2019re working on right now for UNI, renBTC. We\u2019re doing MIP27, the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module. We\u2019ve got all of those happening at the moment. However, we still need to do the tBTC collateral assessment, and there are many domain team reviews on MIPs14, 17, 25, 29, and 30 that we still have to get to. We\u2019re so packed towards the end of the year that most of that stuff is off. The Foundation team got the auditors chosen. They did a bunch of work on the  DsChief stuff and assisted with our really aggressive schedule for the end of the year.  Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 14:56  We have quite a lot of updates as well from our side. We have been pretty busy the last couple of weeks. We published a few evaluations. There were two evaluations published for Uni LP DAI-ETH and USDC-ETH. ETH-renBTC is also going to be published within the upcoming days. We also published AAVE, Uniswap, and renBTC some time ago. As Chris mentioned, they are supposed to be onboarded really soon. the only one we missed was tBTC, but we aim to release it before the year-end. On the Real World Asset side, as was mentioned last week, the 6S risk assessment was published. The on-chain poll to onboard it also looks good; I think it passed. Another evaluation for RWA was released this week for a New Silver Drop Token, and Philinje made an evaluation. We already started working on monitoring tools for this collateral type. Another risk assessment is shortly following for Consolfreight\u2019s Drop Token. It was delayed due to some additional checks, but we have the draft ready, and it\u2019s going to the internal review. The quickest Real World Asset we can have implemented looks to be the one from 6S. At this point, it remains in the hands of Matthew and his team to have a legal structure with everything in place. There was also a lot of work from our side during the past few days on MIP27, the debt ceiling instant access module. We needed to propose parameters for this model. The idea was to have some kind of test run to implement it for at least three assets that could see most of the holidays\u2019 benefits. However, as I noted on the forum yesterday, we found that this module might lead to unintended behavior. There are possibilities somebody could make the debt ceiling fully utilized by performing certain repay and mint activity actions. Meanwhile, he could lower the debt ceiling, so we are actually in contact with the smart contracts team to see if this could be fixed somehow or adjusted shortly because if not, we\u2019re unsure that this model can be implemented or could be implemented only for ETH-B and assets which reap most of the benefits. In any case, if it doesn\u2019t go through, we\u2019ll probably just be on the safe side and propose some increased debt ceilings starting next week for the holidays in hopes that we won\u2019t have this issue with executive votes and hitting debt ceilings. Large work was also done on finalizing the updated risk parameters for all collateral types. Next week we should release a table that includes updated risk premiums and debt ceilings for each collateral type. The plan is to help the rates group meet next week because there\u2019s a monthly meeting scheduled. We have some assets in the portfolio of which risk metrics have changed since they were onboarded. That is why we might need to make some adjustments for both the stability fee and debt ceiling. For instance, BAT is a good example where both risk premium and debt ceilings are no longer appropriate. This same table also includes proposed maximum debt ceilings. This is something that the instant access module for debt ceiling actually needs .so we were also planning to use this same table. It\u2019s going to be updated monthly for debt ceilings as well. Next week, we aim to work on monthly updates on a report for rates. As I mentioned, the rates group has a monthly meeting, so we may propose some changes due to this updated premium table. We also intend to propose some debt ceiling adjustments. I\u2019m also planning to write a risk report on the PSM implementation. We still need to discuss which stablecoins we want to initially include in PSM and in what proportions. We might also need to discuss if disabling the stability fee for stable coins won\u2019t be passed. I think it will, but you never know. In such a case, we might need to start thinking of increasing surplus buffer to prevent under-water vaults. Finally, we\u2019re watching closely the outcome of the vote for Compounds adjustment to their liquidity mining scheme, the reward scheme, where they plan to limit DAI borrowing. This could positively affect the DAI peg if users from Compound start switching to another favorite yield farming asset. So that\u2019s it from risk, does anybody have any questions?  Frank Cruz: Yeah, Primoz. not to get off the subject, but the USDCB vote debt ceiling is 30 million. Do you think there\u2019s a need to increase that in case we have a big sell-off? USDCA is almost at the debt ceiling of 485. do you think it\u2019s necessary to bring that up to 100 million, or is it unnecessary? Has the risk team looked at that or thought about that? Primoz: That\u2019s a good point. There was some discussion if this vault type is needed. First of all, I think it is precisely required for this kind of event when you have liquidity drying up. You really need it for liquidation events. In terms of what kind of debt ceiling should be applied there, I would say it really depends on what happens when we implement the PSM and what sort of thing we choose when it\u2019s going to be more evident what kind of buffer is needed. I found some calculations for the number of stablecoins necessary to go to 1.001 if we choose 0.1. but yeah, it really depends on the whole picture after the PSM is implemented and the peg stabilized. We will need some kind of buffer on the PSM as well, and then on top of it, as you mentioned, we would need one on USDCB, and probably a bigger one might be required just in terms of what\u2019s the current DAI exposure. So yeah, good point. Frank Cruz: Alright, cool, so you guys have been thinking about that, awesome.    Amy Jung Community Development Team Update 22:50  I wish I had more to update for this week, but a lot of the work I\u2019ve been doing is Foundation related. I have been reviewing a few really exciting grants. I can\u2019t wait to announce those. One of the things that I want to mention is that we did choose a fellow for the Kleros and Maker legal assessment for collateral fellowship. He will be joining a call to introduce himself at some point by the end of this year. There\u2019s not much else for me to mention.  Juan Collateral Call Update 23:56  Yesterday, we had a call with Leverej where they showed us a bit about their platform and the work that they were doing with L2. That was quite interesting. Next week we\u2019re going to have Mona Lisa from Melon Protocol. that\u2019s next Wednesday the 9th at 6:00 PM UTC. I wanted to comment that I managed to convince Lev to join me at a teapot party and explain MIP30. That\u2019s going to be the second session of \u201cKnow Your MIP\u201d this Monday, December the 7th at 5:00 PM UTC. Yeah, teapot party, sorry maybe that was a bad joke. Those are the three updates from me, are there any questions?  Charles St. Louis MIPs Update 25:23  There\u2019s not a whole lot going on this month due to the recently ratified Calendar Exceptions MIP, but I\u2019ll just share my screen to provide a quick update.  1574\u00d7940 173 KB  This week and for the next couple of weeks, there won\u2019t be many MIPs updates other than proposals moving from different statuses, new proposals coming in along with new discussions. But yes, due to the Calendar Exceptions MIP accepted in November, there won\u2019t be a governance cycle this month.  1564\u00d7898 168 KB 1582\u00d7892 184 KB  As always, for more details on the status of collateral onboarding, check out the prioritization framework spreadsheet that can be found in the forums and on collateral.makerdao.com. Also, there is an update in RocketChat called Collateral Onboarding Updates External, which you can join to get updates from the domain teams on their specific areas and progress of testing, mania deployments, etc.  1574\u00d7900 149 KB 1576\u00d7896 121 KB Procedural LongForWisdom November MIPs Governance Cycle Review 30:40  We\u2019ll just go into the review. Then we can segue that into general discussions on the MIP proposal move to all get approved. Some of those were fairly important such as the ratification of the operational support domain, which is pretty significant because it expands the scope of what the DAO does. It\u2019s awesome and definitely needed. we also saw the declaration tip for source code funding, which I think is potentially significant because that implies that MKR holders are willing to more generally fund the governance community and the activities they take part in on the forum. This is good because no guarantee was going to be the case. As mentioned, the debt ceiling and access modules should also be pretty big. Does anybody have any thoughts on the previous governance cycle or the next one? Lev: It would be nice to get a bit more feedback since MIP30 is in the RFC phase. This is the time to talk about it in hopes that we could get that live in January.  LongForWisdom: That\u2019s true. I\u2019d encourage people to leave feedback. Lev: Just an update on the timing there. I\u2019m planning to submit that in early 2021, which I believe is the next opportunity to submit as part of the normal governance cycle. LongForWisdom: That\u2019d be correct. We\u2019ve recently seen it tend to work better for submitting MIPs when as much of the code and checks tests have been completed before them being formally submitted. That eases up the burden on the smart contracts subsequent to them being approved. How far along is that sort of stuff is with MIP30? Lev: It\u2019s very far along. All of the things you\u2019ve mentioned have been completed before the MIP was even proposed to RFC. Integration tests and RPC tests are all there. There hasn\u2019t been any iteration on the code since we\u2019ve published the MIP. If other suggestions come up, we\u2019ll make pull requests to make sure it\u2019s transparent. There isn\u2019t any plan to make any other changes currently.   LongForWisdom: Cool, do you have any plans in the direction of audits? Having briefly looked at the change, it seems to be more involved than some of the changes we\u2019ve had recently.  Lev: I think it\u2019s a good question for the community as well as the Smart Contracts Domain Team to weigh in on because we haven\u2019t yet had a precedent for getting external audits organized and funded as a community effort before. So I\u2019d be interested if anyone wants to make any suggestions there. What\u2019s currently planned is to get more feedback from folks in the community and the smart contracts team regarding the extent of the community\u2019s review until now. LongForWisdom: Yeah, as you said, we haven\u2019t had a precedent for the community organizing and paying for audits yet. Though we do have MIP14 that has been passed now. In theory, we\u2019re supposed to use that to spend funds for the protocol.   Lev: There\u2019s an issue I wanted to raise concerning, since you mentioned it\u2019s obviously good to have as much fixed technically before the MIP is formally submitted, Do you think the supply is all the way up to the actual spell? The spell is usually something that the smarts contracts domain team was preparing toward the end of the process. The way the spell is written depends on what else is going into that bundle executive and the state of the system of the time that it\u2019s being added. It\u2019s not something that you can necessarily freeze at the mid-proposal stage. Do you have an opinion there on what the role is?  Chris: Yeah, I can give an opinion on that. The most that we\u2019d want to see from the spell are authorizations and stuff like that to understand what the spell is going to do. We don\u2019t need to make the entire spell while it\u2019s in the MIP approval process. What would help us is after it makes it through that process, whatever team is responsible that submitted the proposal, begins working on a spell to help integrate it into the system. Then we can lift parts of that and would make things much more manageable. Otherwise, we\u2019re going to bottleneck. In fact, we kinda already are; we already had to create the collateral priority sheet for the collaterals that we\u2019re adding, and a lot of the MIPs are starting to pile up. As far as MIP30 goes, I\u2019m super excited about it, and everything so far looks great. So I think you guys have supplied what you need to at this point. Lev: That\u2019s great to hear. Just to confirm, you think it\u2019s best to start work on the spell once the MIP has been formally submitted. Specifically, in the case of CropJoin, the system authorizations are part of the RFX integrations test. That part is kind of there but not in the form you could actually copy and paste into a spell. Chris: That\u2019s all I think we\u2019d really want to know ahead of time. The technical MIP is just a sort of authorizations. This way, you can think about what it has access to while you\u2019re auditing. With regards to auditing in general, it does seem like we should start using MIP14 or some other way to get auditors that are familiar with the codebase to take a look at our code. Auditors right now are really far out. We were hoping to have everything finished and audited by the end of December. Still, now it was pushed to January due to busy schedules. This may even extend into February or the end of Q1 to get just the audits complete. So as you can tell, auditors are really far out. I\u2019m just setting the expectation that if we start leaning on auditors, it very well could add another 6-month delay to any technical MIP that we put out there. Something worth thinking about is if we want to put someone on retainer and basically have a dedicated firm that is always auditing their stuff. We sat down with a good chunk of auditors and went through each one of them. We had a conversation for an hour about their capabilities, how many people they put on the team, what types of tooling they bring, and their methodologies. We stacked all of those auditors against each other and said, okay, we\u2019re going to choose a number of auditors, so let\u2019s make sure we get wide coverage of formal verification and manual audit and some tooling stuff. We looked to see if we could get a good breadth of coverage. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve chosen them in the past, and because we\u2019ve previously done that work, we can say these are the people the foundation has already worked with. Therefore, the DAO should consider putting some of these guys on retainer or working with those projects.   Frank Cruz: Chris, circling back to deploying spells. I know on the forum you\u2019ve mentioned that MIP22 regarding something you could do with port over to MIP21. Can you elaborate on that a bit more?  Chris: Yeah, so MIP21 and MIP22, for context, are the two significant real-world asset cases that we have right now. They\u2019re both a bit special in that they don\u2019t use the MKR protocols liquidation system or the MKR protocol oracle system. They have their own implementations of those things in various ways, but there are important common threads. We still have to plum in liquidations and emergency shutdowns. The work that\u2019s happening on MIP21 is to shut the protocol down and still have DAI holders have a claim on the token that would represent MIP21. A lot of that work can kind of be brought over to MIP22 as the RPC or simulation tests that we\u2019d run against those to make sure that the integrations worked correctly. The idea is not to duplicate code but to make sure that everything passes the same test. If it doesn\u2019t, we have a really good reason as to why but for the most part, the two implementations are very different. It\u2019s not like we can lean on too much, but at least there are a few areas where they should check the same boxes.   Frank Cruz: Cool, thanks, and circling back real quick. Maybe some people have a few questions about real-world assets. Is the Gauntlet thing still on the table for 2021 for the DssGov?  Chris: Gauntlet is doing an economic simulation of liquidations 2.0 right now. They\u2019re still working on it. They have plenty of time to still do that because other auditors are delayed. So yeah, Gauntlet is still doing their thing. I don\u2019t know if there was a plan for having them on DssGov, or is that a slip of the word? Frank: Yeah, I hate to put you on the spot, but I thought you were going to bring them on one day to give us feedback. Chris: Oh right, there is still a plan written down to schedule another sort of community session where the Risk Teams show up, and we talk about individual risk parameters. We were hoping to have Gauntlet step in on that conversation as well, but at this point, that\u2019s probably not going to happen until next year. However, that may be better because Gauntlet will have a good mastery of what those options are and probably give us some helpful feedback. Cruz: Thanks, man.   MakerMan: One last thing. I\u2019m hearing from you about this crunch on smart contracts. Everything is broadening in Maker and is all landing in the smart contract zone either operationally or just by writing contracts, executing, or auditing all that jazz. The thought about decentralizing these Maker functions brings up the general question of how you feel that is landing on you? Do you need more resources? Not just funding but also people. I just feel like we\u2019re going to end up under a crunch. Is that a concern for you? Do you see a way for the community to help mitigate it?  Chris: Yeah, I think it is a concern. The foundation is obviously trying to handoff as much as it can to the community. The foundation has also been providing these resources. We\u2019re down 3 engineers on the foundation side. We\u2019ve got another engineer starting next week, which is great, but we\u2019ve also gotta bootstrap people in. Then we\u2019ve got the grants, which is great. They are really helping with collateral onboarding. Sam is obviously amazing as well. Nonetheless, we\u2019re definitely bottlenecked on our technical capabilities to get through all of this. We have the priority sheet for collateral onboarding. We may need to think about the priority for these next MIPs. Overall I\u2019ve been getting concerned about DeFi in general; at the rate that DeFi is moving, the number of exploits happening, the insanity of how dangerous things are, and things are not being audited. Right now, Maker is a cornerstone of DeFi. I think it would be a mistake for us to compromise the strict adherence to the way we audit, review, formally verify all of our contracts just to have more speed. I think Maker should really focus on being a more solid protocol as something that you could rely on. At some point, I think we should get more people to look at this. The decentralization of it is still going to be a tricky process, but that\u2019s another conversation. At what point does everyone feel comfortable where one of the core engineers working on this doesn\u2019t have to review stuff that\u2019s been going into the protocol. That\u2019s also a weird thing for us to feel safe about. Long was asking what we would do for the next monthly cycle, and a little piece of me feels maybe we should pump the breaks, just a little bit, to make sure we get through. We\u2019ve got a lot of really good stuff lined up. Let\u2019s get some of these amazing features out with a lot of focus on trying to make sure they\u2019re secure and safe. If we try to push too much, we\u2019re going to make a mistake. We\u2019ve got too many collaterals under custody at this point. Makerman: I share your view on that, and I just see it as a building thing. Suppose we don\u2019t provide resources either in the centralized fashion through Maker or through governance in terms of finances. In that case, I foresee this whole space broadening. I agree with you. I have serious concerns about how this thing is broadening. We have regulations that have dealt with various collapses of financial systems.   LongForWisdom: I hate to interrupt, but we have to move on. Makerman: I just want to know what we can do. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to get to our Decentralized Smart Contracts Team within a year. Brian: This is a space-grade code. We have to do this right the first time. This isn\u2019t typical financial software. We can\u2019t restore from backups. I\u2019m concerned about what may happen when we take off. LongForWisdom: Thank you for that Brian, Let\u2019s move on now.  ",

I\u2019ll iterate a little bit of what Chris said earlier. I will walk through the top 4 steps of voting on a proposal to authorize the new chief and remove the permissions from the old chief. That\u2019s the executive proposal that\u2019s on the portal now. If you haven\u2019t voted for it, please do so. Then once that spell is scheduled, we\u2019ll have a 72-hour delay and office hours. Expect that to be Monday or Tuesday; that\u2019s when the new chief gets the authority. The permissions from the old chief are removed, but it\u2019s not yet activated. This will occur when you vote on the new chief. To do that, you have to withdraw from the old chief and deposit in the new chief and vote as you usually do.  3452\u00d71787 207 KB  The process that I\u2019ll walk you through now is this process of withdrawing, deposit, and vote.  3436\u00d71748 138 KB  In the portal, you\u2019ll see a box at the top of the screen on the executive page. You\u2019ll be able to withdraw MKR to your wallet, and you\u2019ll approve that.  3452\u00d71927 168 KB  You will then see a box that shows you the ability to deposit either to use a hot wallet or a hot wallet with a cold wallet. In this instance, let\u2019s look at the hot wallet only.  3441\u00d71918 192 KB  So that\u2019s number one. Click here to deposit directly into the new chief. In this case, I have 3.5 MKR, so I will deposit that in. once you confirm the transaction, you\u2019ll see in the voting contract how much you have. The note will tell you, please vote on the new chief, which is a separate transaction.  3332\u00d71823 173 KB 3429\u00d71784 168 KB  The executive proposal will appear here as it usually does. However, the second scenario uses the hot/cold wallet setup. There is option two on the list to create a voting proxy if you wanted to do that. This set of screens will be very familiar if you\u2019ve done this before. It walks you by selecting your voting wallet, typically the hot wallet, which you choose from a drop-down list, followed by choosing a cold wallet. In my case, I was using a ledger. Click the wallet address, and here you\u2019ll see the 3.5 MKR I\u2019ve withdrawn from the old chief. Confirm those transactions and link the wallets together. Confirm the locking of the MKR in the proxy. Now you\u2019re able to go back to start voting, which will return you to this screen and invite you to vote on the activate proposal.  3443\u00d71921 250 KB  A few things as I was walking through this that may help people make sure everything works. Make sure the contract data is enabled on ledger devices. Make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to confirm the transaction. When setting up the voting proxy, pay attention to which wallet is automatically selected as your hot and cold wallet. When doing a lot of testing, it was a thing that came up where I had to make sure I\u2019m looking at the right wallet. Otherwise, you should be good to go.  3448\u00d71866 166 KB  Quick reminder, please vote. I think we\u2019re about 12000 short. I expect that we\u2019ll get through it relatively soon, which will set us up for next week. We\u2019d like to get through this phase relatively quickly because we also have executives lined up for the following Friday. Bear in mind that the final vote to activate the new chief also has a 48-hour delay on that spell being activated. We\u2019ve included the reduction from 72 hours to 48 hours in the current executive on the portal. Chris: Yeah, so after we migrate over to launch the new spell, there\u2019s a 48-hour delay on the launch? Derek: Yes Chris: So the launch can happen. We can start migrating over right away, and the launch can happen once we hit 80,000 MKR. We don\u2019t have to wait on the GSM delay to launch the new chief. Then that executive on the 11th will be subject to the 48-hour delay. Derek: Yes, perfect. That was all from me. Ill put this up on the forum post I initially mentioned. Any questions? Let me know if anything is confusing. I\u2019ll do a short video and walk through if people feel that would be helpful. LongForWisdom: Great, thank you, Derek. Sorry if you were a little rushed.  Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 57:09  This week\u2019s update is a little bit different than the other week. I need to talk to you guys about something rather serious. Last Wednesday, between the hours of 22:46 UTC and 02:23 UTC, we experienced an oracle outage. During that time, none of the oracles were updated. The cause was tracked down to be related to a bug in Scuttlebutt, one of the dependencies that we use in the Oracle stack. Scuttlebutt is the kind of P2P \u201cgossip network\u201d that we use for feeds and relayers to \u201cgossip their price messages around.\u201d We\u2019re not aware of any liquidations that were affected by this at this time. There are no liquidations that were triggered or were failed to trigger due to the oracle outage. Stepping into the root cause analysis, Scuttlebutt\u2019s works are almost similar to a blockchain in that messages are hash-linked. You can think of it like how each block has a hash pointing to the previous block. Every time you post a message, you include a hash to the previous message. This means that it has the same kind of immutable properties as blockchains because you can\u2019t go and edit a message from the past. The hash would change, and you can\u2019t delete a message from the past because there would be a break in this kind of chain of hashes linking back to the first message. One of the property results is that every node and every peer on the network needs to have this state locally. The state is relatively uniform, so everyone, for the most part, has the same local state size. It essentially keeps growing over time as more messages gossip on the network. So, what really happened here? Well, there\u2019s actually a hard-coded limit in Scuttlebutt due to an offset codec that it uses. This hard-coded limit is about 4.2 gigabytes. After that limit is reached, it\u2019s not a graceful failure. Basically, the Scuttlebutt client will just seize up, and it will never restart. This was not something new to us. We\u2019ve actually been aware of this issue going a long while back, as far as September 6th of 2019. we extensively tested the oracle v2 code base for about a year before multi collateral DAI even launched. This was one of the issues that we ran into and documented. We calculated how often we would encounter this message. The factors are that there are a certain number of feeds. There\u2019s a certain number of collateral types. There\u2019s also a certain frequency at which you have to update the prices of assets. Therefore with the feed and the number of collateral types, we projected far enough into the future that we wouldn\u2019t exceed the limits of those models. We saw that the frequency of price updates is actually much, much bigger than during our testing phase. We were led to believe that we had about 18 months to migrate to a new Scuttlebutt network with the original calculations before we would hit this issue. Nonetheless, as it stands, we\u2019re earlier than 18 months. MC multi-collateral DAI just turned one a few weeks ago. We hit this threshold much, much quicker than we had initially anticipated. what are we doing about it? Since we launched the Maker oracle protocol, our goal has just been de-risking the oracles across the board. The aim is that we have a hundred percent uptime, and we want to be redundant on different levels. On the one hand, we want to be infrastructure redundant so that no one piece of infrastructure can go down that will affect us. On the other hand, we want to have implementation redundancy, so there\u2019s no one tool that we rely on where a bug in the tool affects every person on the network that we don\u2019t experience any downtime from that. We call this infrastructure redundancy and implementation redundancy. Regarding implementation redundancy, we\u2019ve been quite busy working on it for the past year. This includes coming up with multiple price tools. Instead of just using a single price tool called Setzer, we have another price tool called Gofer. The idea is that you would run both in parallel. If one doesn\u2019t work, the node and the feed would just flip over and use the other. This is on the pricing tool side. One of the things that we\u2019re working on right now is the transport layer side. The transport layer is this network where price messages can be transmitted and distributed. Scuttlebutt right now is the only transport layer. But we\u2019ve been working for the past quarter and a half on integrating lib p2p as another transport layer that would be in parallel. What\u2019s frustrating about this is that had this event happen, if we were to hit this state size limit, say two months in the future, it wouldn\u2019t have affected us in the slightest. We would have already had lib p2p integrated. In terms of mitigations, we\u2019ve already been working on this for quite some time. It\u2019s actually quite frustrating the timing of this how it happened.  LongForWisdom: Sorry to interrupt, but we need to move on soon, so try and cover your last points quickly. Nick: I\u2019ll just wrap up really quick.   I\u2019m just going to skim through a swift timeline. All of this will be posted in a forum post that the oracle domain team is coming up with, so you\u2019ll get all the nitty-gritty details. Essentially, we found out about the issue when a community member notified us that they were having an issue with one of their relays. We quickly identified the cause as the known Scuttlebutt issue. We immediately started reaching out to feeds to assess the situation. After we figured out that this was going to be an issue that was critical and quite time-sensitive and that it could lead to a loss of quorum between the oracles, we decided we needed to execute an emergency migration. This entailed setting up a new Scuttlebutt network and getting everyone all the feeds and relayers migrated over. The goal was that we needed 13 feeds because the quorum for the oracle is 13, so we needed 13 of the feeds to migrate over as quickly as possible. We alerted all the customers of the oracles of the impending downtime. The oracles were not down yet, but we knew based on our calculations of the state size growing that they would be within an hour. We notified them ahead of time of the impending outage so they could take precautions on their end. The oracle domain team drafted together some documentation and tested it for release to the feeds. Then the feed started slowly coming online. As I said earlier, it took us three and a half hours to hit the required quorum level of 13. Afterward, the oracles started updating again. After that, over the next 12 hours or so, we filled out the rest of the feeds and got them on board. That\u2019s it on my end for the event\u2019s description, happy to answer more questions in the chat or on RocketChat later. We\u2019ll have the post mortem out shortly in the forum.  SamM PSM Implementation Update 01:09:34  Last week, the vote to accelerate the PSM launch passed. As per the vote instructions, I set up a post that I mentioned in the chat to track the PSM launch progress. There\u2019s sort of 4 key things that need to be done.  Smart contract audits; I reached out to a few community members. Some have gotten back to me, and I\u2019m waiting on others to go over the contract to make sure it\u2019s all good and do some more informal audits. I\u2019m also in discussions to get a more formal audit in place, and more on that to come. The second piece is risk analysis. We should have that next week so stay tuned for that. I\u2019ve deployed the contracts to the Kovan. I\u2019m just waiting on the Kovan deployment process to merge that in, and then we\u2019ll have it on Kovan. The final step is deployment to the mainnet. Any questions, feel free to ask me on rocket chat   LongForWisdom: Thank you, Sam.  Lucas Open Discussion over the prioritization of Real-World Assets 01:11:12  Lucas: I started a forum thread outlining what\u2019s happening with real-world assets. I just want to give a brief timeline to get everyone in the same picture. Some of the first world real assets and MIPs were accepted or voted in sometime in May. Since then, we\u2019ve been working. This was not even the beginning of this initiative of bringing real-world assets into Maker. Since then, we have had continuous discussions about collateral onboarding calls. We\u2019ve started with a real-world assets working group that began assessing the risk. I\u2019m super happy to see that we now have the first real-world asset going live sometime soon with the risk assessment and all the other domain work being done. Although there are others and for which New Silvers\u2019 risk assessment has been out since Tuesday, I believe. ConsolFreight is hopefully to follow soon. Centrifuge is doing a lot of the leg work necessary to bring those on. In that work, we actually did a few things. We proposed a sub proposal for MakerDAO to declare the intent to onboard Centrifuge assets according to the framework we\u2019ve explicitly outlined with the MIP13csp5. MIP22 also outlined liquidations and how Maker is to integrate with Centrifuge based assets. Both of those were posted on the forums in September and approved by community vote. It was then ratified, and we\u2019ve now been working on it. At the same time, we\u2019ve been getting mixed signals from domain teams and the Maker community concerning these assets\u2019 priority. Centrifuge has brought a lot to the first world assets; we have New Silver now ready to start originating the first loans the minute the spell gets executed. They are already looking at assets that fit within the bounds that the Risk Team has agreed upon. We started working on a spell and have been working with the community. Nevertheless, we\u2019ve had this apparent signal request that ended with a vote on-chain that was very heavily in favor of prioritizing real-world assets. But this is still taking much longer than we are hoping to. We\u2019re doing everything that we can to get this ready into one of the following executive spells. I wanted to bring this up as a topic to discuss in general. One of the examples right now on the forum is that it seems like renBTC and a bunch of other coins is ranked higher than these assets that we have that are ready to diversify their collateral base to generate a significant amount of DAI and generate a significant amount of liquidity in the system are not seeing the attention that I believe they should get. My question to the domains team is, what could we do to speed these things up? I think the Maker community has often indicated that Centrifuge assets and real-world assets are something that we want to see in production.  Chris: The domain teams are all feeding back into that collateral priority sheet that I linked in the sidebar. We\u2019ve got several collaterals that the community has greenlit. There are several different teams. There\u2019s the sort of greenlit score itself. I don\u2019t know if Governance has some feedback, but we give it a gut check on each of these metrics. Then that rolls up into a score. One thing that we can do in the sheet to prioritize real-world assets, we could ask if this is a real-world asset or not? If it is, we could add additional weight to that column, which might adjust the score and move real-world assets above some of the other things on the list. That would be where I would kick the discussion off. What we should do is funnel all assets into the priority sheet. If it\u2019s done well and we iterate on it, we should see the most bang for the buck for the protocol. Suppose we believe that we should diversify into real-world assets as that community poll had suggested. In that case, we certainly could add an additional rating score that could bump all real-world assets up the list a little bit more. That\u2019s where I would start.   Lev: What\u2019s actually still required from the domain teams to get MIP22 onto a collateral onboarding poll similar to the 6S one that has just finished?  Chris: What we need are domain team assessments. We would start with New Silver, and we need a domain team assessment from smart contracts and oracles. So we need those two assessments. I\u2019m working with Lucas to see if we could review that, but it\u2019s not just as easy as grabbing an ERC20 and knowing what the stack looks like. There\u2019s certainly more involvement, and we don\u2019t really know what we might find when we dig into it. The areas that Lucas and I have already talked about would be similar to MIP21; what we do in an emergency shutdown and make sure the code can handle an emergency shutdown and be able to yank tokens. In MIP21, we sort of wave hands, and liquidations happen via the trust. Still, liquidations are actually taking place on-chain using the Centrifuge contracts. I have not dug into that code yet, so we still have to dig in and ensure that liquidations are safe. I don\u2019t know if the Risk Team has evaluated that. The same thing can be said about oracles. We get a standard oracle price from these audits that the rep does. For MIP21 and for MIP22, they\u2019re sort of providing their own pricing. Therefore, we\u2019re bypassing our oracles, so we\u2019re getting both pricing and liquidation from Centrifuge contracts. that need some sort of heavy screening to make sure that\u2019s correct. Nkunkel: It\u2019s not that it needs scrutiny or that it\u2019s correct. I think it\u2019s incentive misalignment. I don\u2019t see how you can have an issue with an asset having the ability to change the price on the fly. The Maker protocol is taking on a considerable amount of risk. I don\u2019t really think that there\u2019s no oracle here. There needs to be a layer in between whatever the Centrifuge price is and the price the system is using.   Lucas: Can I address this point. Centrifuge and I are not the issuers. We are a team of people who have been working for more than 2 years on addressing this issue of how we allow issuers like New Silver to do this. I\u2019m standing here asking and outlining the process and everything we\u2019re doing to make this safely. I\u2019m not asking for a 200 million dollar debt ceiling to retire in the Bahamas. We\u2019re talking about slowly ramping up these assets with a scope that allows these asset originators to get the first experience for us to prove out this can be done. That this is something that the DAO can do. In the last 1.5 years, we haven\u2019t been able to show this. We want to grow this ramp, right? Seb, Will, and Phil have worked over the last couple of weeks tirelessly assessing these businesses. They are assessing what\u2019s going on. Are you insinuating that we\u2019re doing something here that will lead to them walking away with the 4 million or 5 million dollars proposed as a debt ceiling for New Silver? Are you worried that this is something New Silver will do when their entire business and reputation are on the line?  Nkunkel: I don\u2019t think we should frame it like that. We have crypto where we can build trustless systems. We don\u2019t actually have to trust anyone. Trying to fall back on those weaker guarantees is not something that\u2019s really appealing to me. There is some oracle risk there. And when I say some, I mean significant oracle risk. I would like there to be some layer of obstruction in between that gives the system some protection to dampen that risk.   Sebastian: In response to the price that is given from Centrifuge, that is something that we have discussed with Lucas. We might want to set the price, and the risk team decided that we wanted another price. If there\u2019s an underlying collateral ratio, which is screened manually by the risk team. Suppose the pool assets go below this ratio. In that case, we\u2019ll ask for the pool to be liquidated, thereby basically asking for drop prevention. We need to be sure that the pool doesn\u2019t borrow too much DAI on the system. It\u2019s actually a bit different from 6S. There is no price at all, and everything is on-chain. Centrifuge is more on-chain than 6S. However, I agree that it\u2019s more complicated to integrate.  Lucas: The risk team looked at the credit risk, businesses, and whether giving them 5 million DAI is a reasonable thing to do. We are talking about a price feed that the risk team has already looked at. Is this a lender that we can safely give 5 million provided that they spend it on the right stuff? There is a process in place to do this. This is not a collateral type where anyone in the world can open a vault and try to manipulate a price feed and profit by tricking Maker into minting DAI that wasn\u2019t supposed to be minted. We\u2019re talking about New Silver having a process to originate loans and how they agreed on with the real world assets working group. I reached out to the oracles domain team at least 5 times in the past 6 months explaining how we\u2019re doing this and showing how we could address this. I don\u2019t think this was a lack of trying. We still need to do this, yet we stand here suddenly saying, oh, this is not ready. The community said real-world assets should be prioritized. Nkunkel: Yeah, my team, in particular, is working with a limited number of resources. We have this constant collateral onboarding that goes on every month. It takes up a considerable amount of our time. We have the community telling us we want to do LP tokens. We\u2019ve been working on that. Lucas: I think the community said they want to do real-world asset tokens and not LP tokens. I\u2019m happy to put out a signal request about this, but that\u2019s bullshit.   Lev: We\u2019ve already had a collateral prioritization signal request for real-world assets. It was pretty decisive.  Nkunkel: So we did. We recently finished the oracle assessments, risk assessments, and technical assessments. Lucas: Everyone in the Maker community said that real-world assets are getting a special fast track outside of the normal onboarding process because they\u2019re new and special. The community said we should prioritize them. I don\u2019t think that saying we have one is an excuse for saying that Centrifuge shouldn\u2019t get its work done. Nkunkel: That\u2019s not the point I\u2019m trying to argue at all. Lucas: So when is it getting done? Nkunkel: I don\u2019t want to give you a date and then lapse on that date. I just don\u2019t know. We have spoken in the past, but The problem is that is was too wishy-washy. There was nothing to really look at. At some point, we said a third party would be validating the price and giving us the price. Then we would query the price from the third party. This doesn\u2019t seem to be the case anymore. Lucas: Risk has assessed this without external oracles. No external oracles were promised in this risk assessment. Nkunkel: That\u2019s just from the risk side. Whether you said that I\u2019m pulling the price from someone else or from you, there\u2019s still an oracle. The oracle just happens to be you. Lucas: There is no off-chain oracle feeding in the price. We look at how much has been borrowed and make sure that the value of the collateral within Maker will get repaid. There\u2019s no oracle here. Nkunkel: You provide a value that extends the amount of credit that someone can get against the token. Which formula you use on your side to determine this doesn\u2019t matter. You have the ability to set that price. Lucas: Up to 5 million DAI. We do have that ability. The New Silver can say how much their assets are worth. The real-world assets working group and risk team monitor what they say and how they\u2019re providing info. In a way, that is very similar to what 6s is doing. We have an entire process here, and in the end, if this value is assessed to be not correct, liquidation will be triggered. we have a process in place that will get Maker the DAI back specifically, which is MIP22.   Sebastian: For the sake of getting a solution for the drop token, the price is not that difficult. It\u2019s a constant price plus the accrued interest. Maybe the accrued interest is too complex to compute, but it starts with a price, say maybe $100.  Nkunkel: It\u2019s not about what formula you\u2019re using to price it. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s all fine. It is from a risk perspective that the issuer has the power to set the price, and that, to me, is a huge conflict of incentives. There needs to be some abstraction between the issuer and the protocol that protects the protocol from this. This is a misalignment of incentives. Sebastian: If you can use a constant, it would be a bit of a loss for Centrifuge because they will not be able to borrow as much. We are speaking about 8% per year. It doesn\u2019t change the world. Getting a constant is much easier, I guess.   Juan: These are two different topics that we should discuss separately; oracle risk and prioritization. I think that Nik\u2019s job, before anything else, are to protect the protocol. I believe that Nick\u2019s concerns are entirely valid, and we should work towards mediating any type of risk. Protecting the protocol should be the first priority for anyone working for the protocol, even if the community wants to prioritize real-world assets. I think Chris said in the chat, it\u2019s not that we\u2019re rejecting the proposal. It\u2019s just a matter of prioritization and bandwidth that each team has. I think there has been quite a lot of progress, especially since Seb started guiding the real world assets. It\u2019s easier to achieve in the shorter term for scaling the protocol and making sure the Maker holders will have value. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for at the end of the day. I don\u2019t think that we should mix both topics. One of the solutions was what external people can do to help speed things up. We mentioned for us, it\u2019s much easier to review things than to create them from scratch. Any project that can already give us reports is always much easier than starting from scratch and doing all the heavy lifting. That\u2019s one of the solutions that we\u2019re proposing. Hopefully, we can see this happening because I think that\u2019s something that everyone wants. We shouldn\u2019t mix these topics up. Sebastian: Just to come back to the collateral prioritization sheet. One issue was that real-world assets were penalized for good reasons because they are a bit riskier. However, the collateral prioritization sheet didn\u2019t consider the fact that the community and governance voted on making them a priority. I think the issue is on this point specifically. There was a senior request to make it a priority. On another side, there was a collateral prioritization sheet that didn\u2019t include the senior request event. Therefore, it was two separate pieces of information, and everyone could merge this information differently. LongForWisdom: I\u2019d like to make a quick point here if I can. The prioritization of real world assets like that happened in the past. As a result, the domain teams prioritized a real world asset to work on, 6S. 6S isn\u2019t at the top of the collateral onboarding framework. That was picked explicitly because the community voted for onboarding real-world onboard assets. Whether that was a mismatch of expectations that the community expected the domain teams to drop everything and work on all of the real-world assets in exchange for the domain teams interpretation to get at least one real-world asset going and continue to do the things that we\u2019re currently doing with the other crypto assets.  Nkunkel: I\u2019m not rejecting the Centrifuge collateral onboarding proposals in any way; I\u2019m not saying no. I\u2019m saying it needs work, just like everything else needs work. That\u2019s the issue that we\u2019re dealing with. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re choosing to ignore this. Everything is a priority, and there\u2019s only so much that our teams can handle at once. It looks like right now, I\u2019m the bottleneck here because the risk side has been completed, and it seems like the smart contracts side is a little farther along than I am. Going into the New Year, I will prioritize real-world assets more. It\u2019s not a question of this doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s this has a certain impact on the system that doesn\u2019t look favorable and so we need to retool how that works. So Seb you mentioned that we could use a constant but that would affect the issuer, Centrifuge, negatively because they dont get to use the value accrual to improve their collateralization or to extend their credit so what if there was a tradeoff in between so for right now for stablecoins we use a smart contract called the dsvalue and the owner of this dsvalue can poke it with a value and that\u2019s the value that gets set. What if instead of having this value controlled by the issuer we have the value controlled by Maker Governance and we commit Governance to once a quarter including in an executive to update the price according to the formula that risk uses or I think we recently passed instant access modules MIP, the risk team could be trusted to have an instant access module to change the price that\u2019s in the dsvalue contract, either of those solutions are much more pallatable to me then having the issuer be able to control the price at will, because even though in the latter scenario you\u2019re trusting the risk team it\u2019s not as much of a incentive misalignment by trusting the risk team then by trusting the issuer of the token. That\u2019s my only concern here.   Sebastian: I fully understand you because when we started the risk assessment, we saw that the price of the pool should come from the formula, which maybe could be good or not, but we decided that it was not the work of the asset originator or the technical provider to set the price of the asset, you should do it on your side and what you suggest is just fine. LongForWisdom: Let\u2019s wrap up the call here. Lucas: Nik, would you be able to stay on a little bit longer? Nkunkel: I have at least until the top of the hour LongForWisdom: We\u2019ll do the wrap-up stuff then. Going into the holidays, we won\u2019t have calls during the weeks of the 21st and 28th.

All the updates from MakerDAO Governance and Risk Call #116 in this snippet Flash Loans [Urgent] Flash Loans and securing the Maker Protocol On Oct 23 @LongForWisdom posted about how a flash loan was used to pass the executive which highlights a problem, flash loans could be used to influence Governance and resurfaced the possible Governance attack vector (since MKR voting is built to have skin in the game). Couple of actions:  Encourage more MKR on the hat Provide spell to GSM pause for 72 hours De-auth some of the modules that skip that delay (freeze oracle feeds, circuit breakers like USDC-A,)  Amount of MKR in open markets exceeded the hat, this is the urgent problem. Also because oracle\u2019s go behind governance delay it means we suffer oracle attacks during that whole period. THey\u2019re still working through how to deal with liquidations and oracle triggers which will post on the forums. Another solution is an Oracle IAM, which is a large trade off.  B.Protocol\u2019s response on Twitter There was a medium post about this subject awhile ago, so the incentives here to make technical solutions. The community can still rally to protect the hat versus MKR liquidity on pools out there.  Team Updates Smart Contracts  Weekly executive passed, B.Protocol whitelisting passed, monthly executive bundle passed. Pushed YFI-A to Kovan, no changes to collateral onboarding sheet, no domain team reviews from last week. YFI, BAL delayed to next week due to flash loan mitigation taking priority.

There\u2019s a read only channel for collateral onboarding, anyone can join to get updates, pipeline announcements, and more.  Oracles  This week deployed BAL and YFI oracles, but may push off onboarding in favor of executives to address flash loans. Assessments for PAXG, AAVE, and GUSD will be ready to go shortly.

My name is LongForWisdom; I\u2019m the governance facilitator  MakerDAO at the current time. I\u2019m joined by people interested in maker. We\u2019ve got a bit of an agenda today. We\u2019re going to start off talking about the recent issues with flash loans. I think that\u2019s probably on top of everyone\u2019s minds, so we\u2019ll talk about that a little bit and get some discussion going first. We\u2019ll then carry on with the usual agenda, which includes the regular weekly updates and the governance cycle review quickly. We have a segment from Hugh Karp from Nexus Mutual, who will talk about insurance for the maker protocol. Hopefully, if we\u2019ve got time, there will be a segment from Vishesh talking about the peg state. Alright, so I guess some preamble stuff; if you\u2019re in the meeting, feel free to interrupt and contribute to this call when people are talking. We\u2019d love for you to join in, and if it becomes a problem, someone will let you know, so please don\u2019t be shy. I\u2019d also like to do my usual reminder regarding time zones and daylight saving. This meeting is in UTC; daylight savings has happened for me, but I think it might be perhaps on Sunday for a couple of other zones such as EST. Be aware that after that changes, this meeting might shift slightly. Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Updates LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread  If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated.  Discussion: Flash Loans and Securing the Maker Protocol 02:08  Flash Loans and securing the Maker Protocol I posted a forum post the other day talking about how on the October 23rd executive, I believe it was, a flash loan was used to pass an executive. This was a standard plan executive. It wasn\u2019t malicious, but it did highlight that flash loans can be used to influence Governance. That led to a re-evaluation of the flash loan risk and the potential for malicious executives to be posted and passed using flash loans, which was deemed a risk that we should probably deal with. So, I\u2019m going to post the forum post for people to read. There\u2019s a bit of a summary there. We talked about some actions, the main one being to encourage more Maker to get on the hat proposal, which helps prevent malicious changes. I\u2019m also including an executive spell to increase the GSM module pause delay from 12 hours to 72 hours and deauthorize some of the modules that could skip that pause delay. Chris, do you want to talk about what\u2019s been going on regarding the changes and how you found the issue?  Chris: Yeah, I think that\u2019s probably a good idea. So I actually wanted to bring up that in a way, there was kind of two incidents. The first is that, sure enough, last Friday\u2019s executive finally went live on Monday via a flash loan, which is probably not great considering that most of the mechanism design behind MKR is that MKR holders have skin in the game, and that\u2019s alarming enough to prompt a re-evaluation of the flash loan risk. Then, shortly on the heels of that, a second incident, nothing really happened. On the 27th, the amount of MKR, for the first time ever, that was available in the open markets for flash loans exceeded the amount that was in the hat. So, in our minds, that\u2019s the huge urgency about flash loans right now. It\u2019s that for a brief window of time, if you were paying attention, you could\u2019ve flash loaned and pushed in a malicious governance proposal from \u201czero\u201d to \u201cscheduled.\u201d This would\u2019ve put a lot of urgent burdens and work on us to try and drop that proposal as well a lot of organizing MKR and trying to clean up the mess. So those are the two incidents. Right now, we think that that risk is probably going to persist; I know it\u2019s mitigated right now because we have enough MKR on the hat, quite a bit on the hat, over 120 thousand MKR last time I checked - I don\u2019t know, somebody can drop that number in the sidebar - so what we did is we sort of weighed the risks of having, first of all, we had a few instant modules outside the governance delay, so the modules inside the governance delay, one of them is to freeze the oracle feeds and since, so we initially put that in place because there\u2019s a feed list and over time we\u2019ve been adding a lot more feeds on the list. The more feeds we have on the list, the less likely we will suffer an oracle attack, so there\u2019s still a risk there. We want the ability to freeze those feeds. However, the risk that somebody maliciously freezes a feed with a flash loan is greater at this point than the risk that we have feed corruption with somebody manipulating the price. So we\u2019re thinking we need to put the oracle freeze. We\u2019re actually just going to remove its privilege so that you have to go through the GSM delay if you want to freeze the oracles. And then the same thing with liquidations. The liquidation circuit breaker we added after March 12th was to circuit break the liquidations if they weren\u2019t performing correctly. Since then, we\u2019ve also upgraded to liquidations 1.2, which has the box and limits our upside exposure on how much bad or ill-performing liquidations could reek on the protocol. So the problem is that instant modules are there;  an opportunist could try and disable the circuit breaker or attempt to disable a circuit breaker. We have circuit breakers on USDCA, which is probably the most alarming, so someone could instantly turn that circuit breaker off. Then all of that USDCA that\u2019s up for liquidation would be liquidated on the market right away. Because of flash loans, the risk of that also became more significant than we believe the risk of what the circuit breaker was trying to solve because of the box\u2019s addition in liquidations 1.2. Again, we\u2019re going to remove the privileges from that; we will put it behind the GSM delay. Then, with regards to the GSM delay, 12 hours if a malicious governance action gets scheduled, which one very well could, is a short time to sort of muster enough MKR holders and take action. I think we could do it, but we thought it would be a lot safer too. I guess maybe mustering the MKR holders is probably the more challenging bit, so we suggest 72 hours for the governance delay. That would give us, imagine if something terrible happened on a Friday, that provides us an entire weekend to act plus a day to align enough MKR holders. So those are the three recommendations. To reiterate, they are;  Extend the GSM delay from 12 hours to 72 hours. Remove privileges from the OSM freeze module. Remove privileges from the flipper or the liquidation circuit breaker.     Chris: I\u2019m happy to take any questions, or if anyone wants to have some discussion, that\u2019d be great.  Kunkel: Yeah, I just want to chime in on what the tradeoffs here are. You mentioned that one of the tradeoffs is that the oracle freeze module is now subject to the governance delay, which we\u2019re now proposing to be three days or something. So right now, if there is an oracle attack and then the oracle attack can happen in several ways. But the two main possibilities that I see are either that someone manages to compromise a bunch of the feeds to reach a quorum and submit a malicious oracle price. The other is that someone looks at what price sources we\u2019re using for an asset and then tries to manipulate those markets temporarily to get the feeds to legitimately post this distorted market price. Now, in the past, we would have had this, it goes through an OSM delay, so the oracle security module delay is one hour, and so in the past, we would\u2019ve had this one hour time window to basically fix this. And by fixing it usually what we mean is that we would activate this kind of oracle freeze, so the tradeoff here being that any kind of oracle freeze now is subject to the governance delay of three days, then if there\u2019s an oracle attack, I mean we\u2019re suffering through that attack, we don\u2019t have a mechanism to actually freeze the oracles in time before the malicious price takes effect so it\u2019s not that we get this flash loan governance protection for free you know, there are tradeoffs. I agree that the risk of a general governance attack through flash loans, given the amount of liquidity in the market, is much greater than the risk of an oracle attack. I just want the community to know exactly what they\u2019re giving up here.   Kurt: I would like to jump in there really quickly to make the point that the next priority following this immediate sort of emergency action executive would be to find a way to safely re-enable the ability to instantly freeze oracles or trigger a liquidation circuit breaker. We\u2019re still kicking around the best way to do that. Still, that process is of drawing rapidly to a close. Within the next couple of days, there should be a concrete recommendation put out by the smart contracts team to suggest the best way to do that. Then, the community can go forward based on that.  Nkunkel: One thing I would like the community to consider is, perhaps if they want to give the oracle domain team an instant access module to be able to freeze them but that, to be fair, that\u2019s a big step in the centralization of power so I would totally understand if there\u2019s some reluctance to do that. But that would definitely be one option. Kurt: I\u2019ll add that all the things we\u2019re working on are fully decentralized MKR controlled mechanisms, but that could be an even shorter-term intermediate step. Just give authority to the oracles domain team. LongForWisdom: Alright, thanks for adding that color Nick and Kurt. Anyone else has any comments or questions or anything?   Brian: Hey, Nick. If you were to have your own flash loan or your own instant access module, would you need to be able to flip the OSM\u2019s individually, or would it be sufficient to flip them all at once?  Nkunkel: It would be great to have the granularity to toggle them individually because, as I said earlier, there are two styles of attack. If you can manipulate all of the feeds directly or blackmail all the feeds, you may change all of the prices because you have the quorum to do that. But in the alternative attack where you\u2019re manipulating the price sources, the attacker would only be able to manipulate one oracle. Therefore, it would be quite disruptive if we only have to fix one of them to shut down all of them. I mean, it\u2019s the difference between; \u2018you can\u2019t use KNC over the next day or two\u2019 versus \u2018you can\u2019t use the Maker system at all.\u2019 Brian: That sounds good. We can iterate on this offline. LongForWisdom: Great, thanks a lot, Brian. As I was saying, if anyone else has any questions or comments or thoughts, please chime in, I\u2019d love to hear from more of the community.   Brian: I would like to state from a non-technical perspective. If you, as the community, want to help, your Maker on liquidity pools can attack the system. You would be encouraged to add it to the hat to protect the system. This is something that we\u2019ve known since December when Micah Zoltu posted the medium post about this exact thing. Since then, the liquidity available has just been increasing. We are now strongly incentivized to increase technical solutions for this. However, there is still the option for the community to do their part to protect the hat.  Chris: Yeah, maybe I\u2019ll just echo from a non-technical perspective. Let\u2019s assume in the next week or two we\u2019ve got a nice fix for flash loans. That still doesn\u2019t remove the risk that one of the lending platforms that just lets you take out an MKR loan for a certain period. That\u2019s not going to be an economically viable attack as well. This really does mean that if you\u2019re an MKR holder, you should be careful about where you\u2019re providing MKR liquidity. I think I\u2019ll leave it at that and maybe just leave that discussion for everyone else, so even once we solve all these problems, there\u2019s still going to be a little bit of a risk. I mean, that delay helps us, but it\u2019s, once we have those instant access modules back in place,  if your an MKR holder, you need to be thinking about these things. SamM: So, I posted about this in the chat, but I was thinking about maybe a solution where we could split the value from Maker with the voting capability from it and potentially make some sort of new token that holds the value of Maker through technical means, and it does not allow for voting. I had an idea for this to create a new token called non-voting Maker where you can mint it by locking up your Maker. Still, to un-mint, you can only do it if you\u2019ve previously locked up Maker, so it\u2019s not fully fungible. I posted a little sample code for this, so it\u2019s just some food for thought, I\u2019m still going through the economics in my head, but I was thinking maybe something like this could be a solution. Brian: Now, Sam, we already do have the IOU tokens. So when you deposit your Maker onto the voting contract, you get transferable tokens. I mean, there\u2019s probably no reason why you couldn\u2019t create a Uniswap liquidity pool to do that. Obviously, we don\u2019t encourage that because it does separate the value of the Maker token from your voting rights. Still, I think we might already have the solution. SamM: Okay, well, if that exists, then maybe encouraging whales to use that so they can use their Maker\u2019s collateral without giving up their voting rights? Brian: The only thing is the IOU tokens are essentially deposited slips for the Maker, so you\u2019d have to\u2026 LongForWisdom: I think they\u2019re quite the same. That\u2019s probably something to pursue offline or on the forums, Sam, if you have further ideas, though. Does anyone else in the community have comments or thoughts on this because I\u2019m kind of aware that we\u2019ve reacted to this fairly strongly without doing the usual signaling or polling process? Hopefully, the reasons for that are fairly obvious. Hopefully, people think they\u2019re valid, but please feel free to comment if you\u2019ve got any thoughts. Matthew: I mean, you\u2019re basically talking about splitting up the equity. Basically treating it like preferred equity and common equity where preferred equity could vote, and common equity wouldn\u2019t be able to vote, but ultimately the MKR that wouldn\u2019t be able to vote would be traded at a super discount because at the end of the day the real value of MKR truly ends up being the fact that it can vote. The real question turns out to be how we put together a system that defends from the flash loans today, that\u2019s okay, and then puts together an economical solution where it has a cost. We can always talk later about putting together incentives to let people keep MKR in the hat or in the executive contract. Still, in general, there needs to be a cost associated with borrowing the MKR to put into that executive. Clearly, once it\u2019s passed one or two blocks, it\u2019s one thing, but if people, if you have, let\u2019s just say a one month delay before your voting rights would be usable, I mean there\u2019s an economical cost not only to borrow it but to keep borrowing it for a sustained amount of time you basically dissipate all of the terms. But if you bifurcate those two and get rid of the voting rights, I just think the MKR that wouldn\u2019t have any voting rights would trade for nothing. SamM: Well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. I mean, it\u2019s useful as collateral to take out a loan or something like that, you can, like the price is valuable. Matthew Rabinowitz: But that\u2019s that\u2019s my point, though. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about, though, if it\u2019s only valuable if it\u2019s tradable. Its value is driven around its voting rights is from my perspective. LongForWisdom: Okay, I think maybe going a little bit off-topic here in terms of the specific solutions. To your point, Matt, I think we will all be looking at the economics around voting and things more with the DssGov update. I spoke to Chris a little bit about it the other day. I hope we\u2019re going to talk about it more in the future to figure out how we can incentivize people to keep Maker locked up in the governance contract. I also hope we talk about how voting with borrowed Maker can make it more problematic or costly. So, Chris made another point in the chat, which I\u2019m going to echo because it\u2019s essential. The Maker holders are providing liquidity on, for example, MM\u2019s. While there is a risk there from this flash loan, that is also valuable in other ways because we need MKR liquidity to do Flap and Flop auctions and make Maker tradeable. There are tradeoffs to doing that. If you are doing that with Maker, I suggest just being or trying to stay aware of just how much Maker is on the hat and in the governance contract versus how much is being provided for liquidity. Alright, any other comments before we move on?   Lev: I just wanted to say that for the purposes of this problem, there are three different ways that people are providing liquidity that might be problematic. The first is lending platforms like AAVE and Compound. I mean, Compound doesn\u2019t have MKR currently but presents the same idea. Some of those lending platforms might support flash loans; for example, like AAVE, the second kind is AMMS that has their liquidity accessible with flash loans. So Ubisoft V2 is an example of such an AMM. Also, the ones that don\u2019t natively support AMMS like Unicode V1. Balancer can still be used in combination with another flash loan by trading a borrowed asset back and forth during one transaction. Still, there\u2019s also AMMS that doesn\u2019t make your assets essentially flash-loanable, such as Lunaswap. Hence, it\u2019s actually not inherently the case that if you\u2019re providing liquidity in some sense to MKR that you\u2019re actually making it available for flash loans. Hence, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that there\u2019s more nuance there.  LongForWisdom: Great, thanks for making that point, Lev.   LongForWisdom: All right, I think we\u2019ll try to move on. If anyone has more thoughts about this, the forum thread links about this are a good place to make your arguments, leave your concerns or points. I would encourage everyone to do so. Chris mentioned earlier that two things happened here. I would like to echo that, and that\u2019s the first one, which is the more pressing issue is the risk of a malicious attack. Still, there\u2019s a second issue where people can pass proposed executives that benefit them using flash loans even if they don\u2019t own MKR. But this is less of a problem. However, it\u2019s still an issue, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to figure out how to deal with as well, which we\u2019ve already even started thinking about. So we\u2019re dealing with a more immediate, pressing issue. However, there is still another issue we have to deal with, which will hopefully be addressed in the coming weeks. So, for now, let\u2019s move on to updates from the major teams. All right, I think I\u2019m going to skip Governance at a Glance for this week just for time reasons. It is updated on the forum if anyone\u2019s interested. Otherwise, governance updates have just been me dealing with this mostly and recruiting people to help with Governance related things. If you have anything extra to say about smart contracts, Chris, feel free; otherwise, we can move on.  Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 25:41  Yeah, I\u2019ll see if I can go through it pretty quick. Most of it is, obviously, we got randomized onto this, so things changed a little bit. So, the weekly executive for the surplus buffer going from two million to four million passed. Also, the B.Protocol approval for OSM and medianizers passed. I want to lighten the mood a little bit here and say that I think it\u2019s fair to say that the Kurt curse is still in effect. So, for those that don\u2019t know, for a while, whenever Kurt would make an executive spell, it would never pass. When he deployed the spell, that transaction hash had a 0XDAD at the front, which was a little alarming. It was then flash-loaned to pass, and it has now randomized us, so maybe we\u2019ll keep Kurt off the executive spells for a while. We love you but\u2026(jokingly laughs). The monthly executive bundle passed, and we did no collateral assessments. We pushed YFI-A a to Kovan. Sam\u2019s been working on GUSD-A this week to Kovan. There\u2019s still a little bit of tooling work that happened on the DSS executive. There are no changes to the collateral onboarding priority sheet. The documentation for collateral onboarding is in final review and will probably be posted reasonably soon. There are no domain team reviews from last week, so this coming week obviously, we\u2019ve got this executive that we talked about. The three things already I covered, then we\u2019re going to put off probably YFI and Balancer until maybe next Friday. Still, it\u2019s hard to say if we end up pushing some other, more urgent change to try and fix the flash loan thing that\u2019ll take priority. So if there\u2019s nothing there, then YFI and BAL can go out probably as they\u2019re pretty much ready to go. Assessment work: I think we\u2019re going to do some of the Uniswap V2 tokens because we\u2019re targeting the end of November for Uniswap v2. USDC\u2013ETH-A and DAI\u2013ETH-A are the two at the top of the priority sheet. Still on that list is just UNI, renBTC, and TBTC. Domain team reviews, again this is more backlog for MIP 14, 17, and 25. The foundation\u2019s continuing to engage auditors for liquidations 2.0. Now that team has been sort of randomized onto working on it; Probably hoisting some features back from what we were going to do for DssGov, but that\u2019s not set in stone yet, so we don\u2019t know. Still, they\u2019re working on the mitigation for the events this week. Also, I\u2019m gonna post a link. I don\u2019t know who in this channel\u2013maybe Charles will mention it, but there\u2019s a collateral onboarding updates external channel. I don\u2019t know if people can just join that. It\u2019s in the sidebar. It\u2019s a read-only channel aside from domain team actors. Everyone is encouraged to sit there if they\u2019re waiting on alerts for testing a new collateral type in Kovan or if they\u2019re waiting until something gets pushed to production to begin testing any aspect of this stuff. That\u2019s the sort of pipeline where the pipeline announcements will go anywhere from people using UI\u2019s to other domain teams and all the way down to people running keepers to know they need to update their keepers to manage these new collateral types.  Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 29:56  Besides that, someone wanted to use our oracle so bad that they flash loan attacked us. I don\u2019t know how to feel about that. Besides that whole thing, there weren\u2019t any polls or any other executive stuff that happened in oracle land. As far as what we\u2019re working on, this week, we deployed the Balancer and YFI oracles, so those are ready to go. Still, like Chris Mooney said, basically, we may push off the onboarding for those in favor of doing executives for the flash loan attack fixes. In addition, I\u2019ve basically completed all the stuff on the tech side for PAX-G and for the AAVE token, as well as for GUSD. Those should be ready to go shortly. Right now, I\u2019m exclusively just focusing on the LP token oracles because it\u2019s a significant change from our regular oracle stack. It\u2019s basically a standalone smart contract, so we\u2019re basically trying to just get as many eyes as possible on it. The other thing is that this is a contract that we\u2019re going to want to get audited, but it would take forever if we did do that because of how busy most auditors are. A day to finally onboard the LP tokens, I think the healthy trade-off here is that we can onboard the LP tokens targeting the end of November. Still, we\u2019ll just have to really restrict the debt ceiling so if there is some kind of bug that the damage is contained. In parallel, we can be seeking audits. As the audit results come back, we may need to make some changes and redeploy the oracle or hear back that everything\u2019s okay. As we go through those, we can feel more comfortable raising the debt ceiling to more reasonable levels. But the good news is that once we have a contract in place for one of them, we can easily deploy it for all of them, so you only get that huge kind of friction once, and then you get all the other ones for free.  Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 33:09  There\u2019s ongoing work on collateral evaluation currently finalizing renBTC, but as Nick said, starting to focus more on UniLP tokens as was agreed between domain teams. UniLP is a bit non-standard to evaluate from our side. Still, we think if something like ETH-DAI or ETH-USDC, we would actually de-risk the portfolio due to the lower volatility of such assets. Also, I think a higher debt ceiling could be applied from our side because, for instance, if you release something like ETH-DAI\u2019s collateral, such worlds\u2019 unwinding should carry less slippage because collateral itself holds DAI. The only missing part is whether we can soon implement a feature that will have farming supported by worlds that would definitely attract more demand than otherwise. As for rate changes this week, the rates working group proposed one change, which is to lower the ETH-B stability fee from six percent to four percent. We believe six percent is currently too high, especially since farming yields dropped. The cost of capital now plays a more important role when people decide to leverage. I still think it was a good experiment to see the borrow rate threshold on lower liquidation ratio ETH-Wall types. By lowering it to four percent, we might get a clearer signal from maker users about rate sensitivity if it gets passed. There\u2019s already a signal on stablecoin fees, which I think just ended today. It seems stability fees on stablecoins will remain unchanged at four percent. They will remain at four until leading stablecoin worlds reach a hundred percent collateralization ratio. I think this should be in mid-December. This means we might also need to have another discussion about potentially raising the surplus buffer. I think that might not be necessary because the four million surplus limit that is effective now will be reached only a few weeks before we disable decent stablecoins. I think the best thing to do is to wait until we are close to the limit and then evaluate the whole situation. And then the last thing I want to point out is that Maker now has a lot of unutilized debt ceiling for certain world types. It\u2019s hard to manage it efficiently without having instant access modules that I think need 27 AMMS to implement. But still, we might want to decrease certain debt ceilings such as those for ETH-A, where there\u2019s more than 200 million unutilized.  There is also a bit of a problem with MANA, where liquidity metrics got much worse in the last few weeks. We might need to decrease the debt ceiling even below the current depth exposure, currently at about 400 000 DAI. The new models that we use now, which are being tested for risk parameters, are suggested a debt ceiling between 200 or 300.000 DAI. That\u2019s because liquidity really got worse. Much of the volume happens just on Huobi Exchange. We know there\u2019s usually some wash trading there. I was actually thinking next week we might want to do a larger executive vote on debt ceilings, where we first propose a debt ceiling increase for renBTC and Link. Link was already signaled. Then, at the same time, propose a decrease for ETH-A and potentially also ETH-B. Simultaneously, we decrease for Mana and USDT because there\u2019s a signal which is still pending. Still, it seems a majority voted for a decrease to 2.5 million, so I\u2019ll make a post soon about this debt ceiling proposed changes. If they are agreed on between the community, they could go into this Monday on-chain pool.  LongForWisdom: Great, thank you very much. Yeah, I think any questions or anything or comments on that can probably go in the forum Primoz posted.   Matthew Rabinowitz: One quick question just on prioritizing items where you outlined that there\u2019s a Uniswap LP priority. Simultaneously, there\u2019s been a poll about RWA\u2019s prioritization, just curious which ones are getting priority.  Primoz: On our side, there\u2019s not really a significant difference because the RWA is now covered kind of by separating. I\u2019m involved as well, but Sebastian and Will, and Phil are working on them. UNILP\u2019s on our site are covered by so-called regular evaluators, so we shouldn\u2019t really have a problem with that. This is for the risk domain. Chris: For smart contracts, I think we, in all cases, just need to do the normal token assessment of what\u2019s going to go in for the RWA. Matt, I think I had reached out and sort of mentioned something about that earlier, but then we\u2019re just going to start trying to push it through the onboarding process. We\u2019ll build the sort of deployment spells and whatnot that we need to push RWA, and while we\u2019re doing that, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find certain complications or other things that we need to work on. Still, I think it\u2019s going to be an ongoing process, so I would say that\u2019s our baseline. We\u2019ll be working on RWA while we\u2019re also doing these sort of easier ERC-20s. Matthew Rabinowitz: Thank you.    Amy Jung Community Development + Operational Support Update 39:28  I\u2019ll be pretty short here to save everyone some time. I did submit the operational support domain for formal submission, so both the domain itself, a myth for the domain, and then the sub proposal proposing myself as an operational support facilitator. I\u2019m also working on submitting a budget MIP soon as well as. I do hope in two weeks we will be launching our grants platform, which would allow applications to be a little bit more visible to everyone. Also, in my presentation, I\u2019ll give a little bit more about what the process is and all a lot of the data that we\u2019ve collected on how we award and distribute those grants.  Juan Collateral Call Update 40:36 1218\u00d7718 58.2 KB  Yeah, just a quick update from my side. As a quick collateral onboarding update, yesterday, we had two calls; the first one was ConsolFreight, so Alejandro and Ernesto were there from ConsolFreight. There were also people from the centrifuge team, SebVentures was there, it was quite interesting.  1218\u00d7656 88.9 KB  After that, we had the Curve Finance team with Michael, Angel, Charlie, and Julian joining us, also a very interesting call. Actually, Julian tweeted to get the CRV token passed as he saw that participation was relatively low, at around 3%. I don\u2019t know if that helped with the poll or not. We discussed which other liquidity tokens could be brought to the maker ecosystem.  1216\u00d7730 80.6 KB  Just a quick reminder if you\u2019re good at any of these topics, risk or data analytics, speak with Primoz, Oracles or anything backend-related with Nick, Chris Mooney for smart contracts, any full-stack developer or comms with to Tim and Amy, governor for LongForWisdom, and note transcribes with David  1214\u00d7640 78.8 KB  The application for the Kleros Maker Foundation fellowship is still open, so there\u2019s still time to apply.

These are all reasonably hefty MIPS with a lot of implications. We\u2019ve had protocol DAI transfer, which is the first time we\u2019ve set up a process to transfer DAI out of the protocol to someone for some service. We approved MIP20, which, once smart contract work has been done, would allow us to enable negative rates on DAI; not that we necessarily would, but we would have that option. There are the real-world assets MIPs, and there\u2019s some structural stuff as well. I see a lot of heavy things. If anyone has thoughts about how the cycle\u2019s gone, I think the forum is probably better at the stage as it\u2019s a really short time. I know Charles does a MIPs update post. If anyone has kind of pressing thoughts or comments they want to make, I would suggest putting them on that post.  ",

It\u2019s good to be here. I\u2019m Hugh Karp, and I\u2019m the founder of Nexus Mutual. I suggested a potential coverage for MakerDAO as a protocol, so It\u2019s basically building a tailored policy for Makerdao and Nexus. The main objective is to address the potential for MKR\u2019s pro-cyclical issue when it comes to bad debt. Basically, you have this issue where MKR is burned at high prices when you\u2019re accruing fees. Then if there\u2019s an event, usually the price may drop. Then you mint more MKR at that low price to pay off the bad debt. So we\u2019re aware that Nexus could, in the future, cover a larger section or a more massive chunk of potential bad debts that might accrue to the protocol. Still, Maker is currently bigger than Nexus at the moment. So there are limits that Nexus has, so the primary use would be for a dampening of MKR\u2019s pro-cyclical nature. The idea is that if you look over a cycle of paying costs in terms of the cover versus the claims that you get back, assuming that that\u2019s negative EV over the life cycle, there\u2019s still a significant positive benefit from the actual value of MKR that\u2019s net, burned or minted. I can go through that.  1212\u00d7746 59.6 KB  So, the proposal in summary and all of this stuff can be tweaked. It\u2019s just something to put out there, is that you could buy tranches of cover on Nexus, say three million DAI worth. If bad debt was to exceed five million DAI, then one trench would claim as paid. And, at 10 million, then you paid two trenches, so six million in total, and so up to sixty percent of the bad debt is covered. I think it\u2019s essential that not all of the bad debt is covered because we still want alignment of interest between Maker\u2019s risk management. So I think that that\u2019s important, but this is really a potential dampening mechanism. Regarding limits and pricing and stuff like that, the total maximum cover right now on Nexus would be about 12 million DAI. It\u2019ll grow as Nexus grows, so you could, for example, purchase four-three million tranches. The minimum pricing actually got dropped last week to 2.6% per annum. The actual price is determined by staking the number of people that want to back it, so it is kind of unknown at this point, but that gives you a range of what the pricing might be if this was to proceed. In general, if there\u2019s a known decent amount of demand, I would expect a substantial amount of taking on Nexus. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in the past, so there\u2019s obviously a bit of a range. It depends on the staking, but it kind of gives you a flavor for where it might end up.  1210\u00d7728 82 KB  To give you an example of what could happen using black Thursday as an example, apologies, but I didn\u2019t quite get the numbers right I\u2019ve tried to get the right ones. I believe there\u2019s about 5.3 million of bad debt accrued, resulting in nearly 21 000 MKR being minted. If you had the protocol cover, you would have avoided minting something close to 12,000 MKR. Essentially you pay that at the MKR price pre-event, which is the higher price rather than, the lower price, then you still save, in terms of MKR, minting over the whole cycle. So that\u2019s it. I wanted to keep it short. That\u2019s the main proposal.  1214\u00d7740 109 KB  In terms of other key questions that other people have asked, claims assessment, how claims assessments are done because that\u2019s a pretty important one. The Nexus Mutual members vote on claims, and I guess one of the key things is why they would approve to pay a claim, and that\u2019s the fundamental thing we\u2019re doing at Nexus. All of the incentive mechanisms are designed to ensure that legitimate claims are paid. I won\u2019t go into massive detail about all of that right now. Still, you can definitely look it up, and there are two layers to the incentive structure to pay genuine claims. It\u2019s probably more of a corporate financial type decision here rather than ensuring tail risk or something like that because it\u2019s a bit different right now given Nexus\u2019s size versus Maker\u2019s size. However, I still think there\u2019s potentially a lot of value here in it because the pro-cyclical nature of MKR has, I guess, been discussed quite a few times in the past. So yeah, I might just stop there, and if anyone has any questions, I\u2019m more than happy to answer them.  Discussion 57:30  LongForWisdom: I would say that when I initially read this, I kind of didn\u2019t understand the benefits before I kind of understood the effect as in the kind of cyclic nature of implementing and burning, so I thought that was so once again I realized how it would help, I thought that was good, I know a couple of you in the forum were quite positive and others were quite negative. If any are here and would like to comment, I\u2019d appreciate it. Frank Cruz: So Hugh, I guess the downside is that Nexus Mutual doesn\u2019t survive the next 5 or 10 years or even less? Suppose Nexus Mutual governance doesn\u2019t approve the payout. What would be the difference between just going out to Barclays and getting insurance from them instead of Nexus Mutual, in your opinion?  Karp: I think the first one is you\u2019d struggle to get any cover just because it\u2019s so tailored, and they don\u2019t understand the details right now. The second one is the payment could be made on-chain directly into the right contract. Still, then that would directly avoid the minting of MKR. Hence, there\u2019s a direct level of integration there that can provide a significant benefit in terms of voting for actual auctions taking place. Honestly, I think you\u2019d spend 6 months going around various insurance brokers and not really getting anywhere because this isn\u2019t a standard product at all. Frank Cruz: Got it. I guess you\u2019re saying that for someones like Lloyds to cover one of these protocols is way out there, maybe in the future but not now. Hugh Karp: Yeah, exactly, and they give you cover in US Dollars, and then you\u2019d somehow have to get the claim payment into the protocol. There are quite a lot of details behind it. Even if they were to come up with something like this, they\u2019re quite risk-averse. The regular insurance industry is very risk-averse on this stuff right now. They just don\u2019t understand it. Anyway, long story short, I don\u2019t think it would be worth while.   LongForWisdom: You mentioned something that gave me a thought. Usually, the way that the protocol works in bad debt is that flop payment is triggered in a fixed amount of time after the bad debt happens. I think it may be a week, So I question how quickly would Nexus Mutual governance kind of approve or deny payment. It would need to happen before that time would expire.  Karp: Exactly, so 36 hours minimum payment should be finalized within 72 hours. It could go a bit longer than that, so it\u2019s not absolutely guaranteed to get under your kind of week, but in nearly all circumstances, it would. LongForWisdom: Ok, thanks.   Kordez: Are those prices fixed & static, or If you fixed the long portfolio of MKR, would the pricing change, or is it fixed for a determined time?  Karp: The pricing is fixed for whatever covered period you purchased, and then let\u2019s say you bought cover for a year that would be a fixed price, and then let\u2019s say that expired and you wanted to renew it and over time have different risk parameters than Nexus mutual stakers may have a different opinion and the renewal rate may be higher or lower depending on the staking at that point, but it\u2019s a fixed rate and doesn\u2019t vary. Kordez: Ok, Thanks. How do you manage that the capital is locked inside Nexus, I read something about it but could you just explain? Karp: Yes, we have this concept called the MCR, which is our minimum capital requirement, required to back the covers that we\u2019ve written. No one can take the funds out of Nexus unless we have funds above our MCR. It\u2019s not absolutely guaranteed because insurance companies aim to be undercollateralized to diversify risk. We don\u2019t always have more money than potential liabilities, but the whole point is that we have a certain amount of money that has a very high likelihood of paying all legitimate claims. Kordez: Ok, thanks, and who calculates those MCR parameters? Karp: It\u2019s kinda done with a flat factor based on the cover outstanding, and then we run a more complicated model off-chain. Kordez: Ok, Thanks. Karp: This is tailored to cover bad debt accruing in the protocol, so it\u2019s a bit different from our standard product that we just offer right now.   LongForWisdom: So I guess you\u2019re saying that it would cover bad debt regardless(of the source.  Karp: Yes, it is debt regardless of how it perpetuates.   LongForWisdom: Any other questions before we move on? Thank you so much for coming and doing the presentation.  Vishesh Choudry The State of the Peg MCD System Stats MCD System Stats Alt DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs Maker Vault Stats 01:06:15  For the last week, we\u2019ve been sitting at $1.01 for DAI. There\u2019s been some movement in ETH price, so there\u2019s been some fluctuation as well. That did coincide with the sudden drop in ETH price. Around the 26th, we saw a bit of a spike and some increased volume, nothing too significant. It\u2019s still holding pretty steady. The interceding volumes between the 24th and 26th were very light, so there wasn\u2019t much movement.  1726\u00d7943 145 KB  You could see here the trades that have been executed are centered around $1.009. A majority of that volume being on Uniswap, which is the latest steady equilibrium point, is to have most of that volume being on Uniswap.  1373\u00d7538 75.3 KB  If we look at the DAI-USDC pair, we see here between Swerve, Curve, and DYDX that curve accounts for most of the DAI-USDC trading volume. In the last week or so, we\u2019ve seen that price centered around $1.01 with a bit of a dip and with a bit of a spike around the 22nd, 26th, and 27th. Then we saw a bit of a dip around the 24th when the trading volumes were a bit lighter. DAI-USDT is looking very similar to DAI-USDC. Now we\u2019re sitting at around 937 million total DAI, 337 million of that is from ETH and the other 600 million is from other assets. Obviously, a huge chunk of that is in Compound\u2013about 290 million in terms of the amount that\u2019s not locked up in the DSR at the end of the day. Although that\u2019s a little bit of an irrelevant statistic because it\u2019s not really out of circulation in the same way.  1733\u00d7840 171 KB  Uniswap v2 pool is at the top of the list, followed by the BarnBridge curve and Binance. The majority of the largest positions are in staking protocols or other yield farming, which is expected. We can sort of inspect the positions for some of these larger vaults. If we look at USDC-A, Roughly 360 million is below 101% collateralized, an additional million of that is below 100% collateralized, but the largest chunk is between 101 and 100% collateralized. Pretty much the entirety of the USDC pool is some fraction of 100% collateralized. The 3 or 4 largest positions are all 100.6 collateralized. These positions will be below 100% collateralization in, say, December. That\u2019s basically the continuing growth of these debt positions with the stability fee they currently have and the rate at which that fee will accrue. If you look at the last updated dates for these vaults, they, by and large, haven\u2019t been touched in a month, and then that\u2019s true for the vast majority of stable coin vaults.  1726\u00d7844 163 KB  Some haven\u2019t been touched in the last 20 days or so, even that is few and far between. You could see the curve here where these prices above $1 are irrelevant because you\u2019re already there. It\u2019s basically a question of how much of this debt is ahead of this line or below this line. If we look at some of the other positions, BAT, for example, the largest position is ~2.5 million DAI in debt, and the next one is 600 thousand. Those are, respectably, 240 and under 98% collateralized, which is pretty decent collateralization. That has a projected liquidation wall around .12 for 3.2 million DAI. We now look at ETH, which is another large position. We got a big liquidation wall at ETH price of $318, so that\u2019s about 90 million Dai that we liquidated. You can see that basically, a massive chunk of this debt position is 180% collateralized, and that\u2019s about 85 million.  1724\u00d7841 186 KB  If you look at some of the larger positions, you\u2019ll see that the largest 2 vaults are 280-380% collateralized, which is very solid. Still, they only account for between the two of them approximately 60 million of the overall DAI portfolio. It\u2019s interesting that, in this case, looking at a couple of the largest positions isn\u2019t necessarily representative of the majority of the risk profile for the ETH vaults. The ETH vaults have been updated quite a bit more regularly. It appears that ETH vault users keep up with their collateral a bit more than stablecoin vault users, which is pretty well expected.  1722\u00d7843 156 KB  If we look at the LINK vaults, we\u2019ll see one large vault with 4.2 million dai debt 300% collateralized. Again, depending on your expectation of market volatility, that\u2019s a comparatively larger buffer. At a price of 6.5, you\u2019d have 4.5 million DAI being liquidated.  Conclusion 1:18:11  LongForWisdom: I think we\u2019ll finish up. It\u2019s reasonably late, so any final questions or general reminders anyone wants to make? Nothing? Ok, alright, I guess we\u2019ll stop there. Thank you, everyone, for coming, we\u2019ll have another one of these next weeks, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you all, thank you, Hugh.

Please join us if you\u2019re interested. I am joined by 30 odd maker related people on this fine Thursday. My name is LongForWisdom; I\u2019m the governance facilitator for MakerDAO currently. With the usual preamble, feel free to interrupt and contribute to this call. Don\u2019t worry about interrupting people; it\u2019s okay. And if it becomes a problem, I\u2019ll let you know. We\u2019d love to hear from all of you.   Let\u2019s go quickly through the agenda, then we\u2019ll get started. So we\u2019re going to have weekly updates from the domain teams, the regular weekly updates, and on MIPs and community stuff. I\u2019m going to do the MIPs governance poll review as part of the procedural things. We\u2019ve got two presentation segments this week. We\u2019ve got Derek presenting the improvements to the government\u2019s portal. This is similar to the presentation that happened on the community call earlier this week. Some of you may already have seen it, but the new portal is pretty cool; I\u2019m looking forward to that. And then we\u2019re going to have juanjuan talk about the collateral prioritization framework and show some pictures. Also, giving everyone a reminder about daylight saving time and time zones. This meeting is scheduled in UTC, which means it will move for most of you if you\u2019re living somewhere with a daylight savings adjustment, so just be aware that this may change the time for this meeting soon.   Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Updates LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 02:07 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated.   I\u2019ve been working on documentation for governance parameters; it\u2019s gonna be a semi-long-term thing, I think. I\u2019m starting with the parameters which are most often talked about. Hopefully, we can link to those documentations whenever we\u2019re proposing signal requests or changes to certain parameters. For example, the debt ceilings or collateralization ratios, so that people who are newer to the protocol can get informed more easily.   Other than that, I\u2019ve been keeping things running like usual. That pretty much covers my updates.   Discussions   MakerDAO Protocol Cover using Nexus Mutual  We\u2019ve had some reasonably active discussions on the forum this week with an exciting post from Hugh_Karp of Nexus Mutual talking about MakerDAO potentially taking out insurance against bad debt on the protocol, which kind of garnered a lot of discussion and some good points from both sides from various people. I think we\u2019re going to try and get Hugh on next week\u2019s governance and risk meeting to do a brief presentation and open a discussion on this meeting. If anybody\u2019s interested in that, make sure you come next week.    Rate Setting Framework  The rates working group posted some guidance on the rate-setting framework that\u2019s going to be in use now that that\u2019s our proposal going through governance, so this will be a basic description of how rates proposals will be formed, what time things should happen. Read it if you\u2019re interested in how rates will be set up and how rate changes will be proposed from now on.    Official Launch of mkranalytics.com   I also wanted to highlight a post from hexonaut talking about the official launch of mkranalytics.com. Sam, if you wish to speak briefly about it now, you can. It\u2019s a really awesome analytics site for the maker protocol with all sorts of metrics. You can track and combine them in interesting ways. I look forward to seeing what kind of conclusions people can draw from it.   SamM: You want me to talk about it now?   LongForWisdom: If you want to do a brief, a few sentence plug, or something like that, that would be fine.   SamM: Sure, so mkranalytics is a site for basically tracking time series of every stat within the maker protocol. It doesn\u2019t have everything right now, but it has most things that are relevant. If there\u2019s anything that needs to be added, feel free to just open up an issue or a pull request or whatever; all the code is open-source, so have a look. You can break down by vault type and time-series data, so let me know if anybody has any questions.   LongForWisdom: Yeah, this existed for a little while, but it\u2019s kind of now just coming into proper functionality, and it\u2019s great. Everyone, go and take a look.       Signal Requests   Stablecoin Action Plan  Seeking consensus this week had, I think, one new signal request only, which was hexonaut\u2019s proposal for starting a stablecoin action plan for stablecoin vaults. As people have seen in previous meetings, they will be aware this has been discussed thoroughly in these meetings. Sam kindly put together a post that summarizes the various options of the poll. Please take a look at that and vote if you have strong feelings about dealing with the stablecoin vaults.    Approve Maker Representatives as an oversight role for Real-World Assets   Increase the Auction Surplus Buffer by 2m (System Surplus)  The other signal requests from last week: increase the auction surplus buffer, and approving Maker representatives are currently on-chain. They both just finished, and both polls have passed.    Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 06:50   Last week, we worked on the ETH-B executive, which passed, and it\u2019s on mainnet now, and we didn\u2019t do any collateral assessments for last week. We were busy with onboarding BAL-A to Kovan the previous week, which took a lot longer because we\u2019ve been working on this collateral onboarding documentation. At the same time, we\u2019re onboarding BAL-A, so BAL-A was the collateral that we used, and that was days and days. I just wanted to put a sort of shout out to Sam and Brian and the integration team for smart contracts because it\u2019s a lot of work. I think that doc is pretty much done, and it should pay dividends in the future for us in terms of ramping up other teams to onboard collateral.   I think BrianMcMichael and LucasManual also worked on the DSS executive. I don\u2019t know if they want to mention anything yet, I\u2019ll let you guys chime in if you want to.   BrianMcMichael: We\u2019ve spent the last couple of weeks working on an executive library that\u2019ll help us speed up and reduce potential errors in our executive spell crafting process. Our collateral onboarding process is a very manual process where we go through checklists and follow a prescribed work pattern. The exec lib is basically going to automate a lot of that for us and take a lot of work off of our development team and then collateral onboarding teams outside of the foundation. Then there are just additional things. We can set all of our debt ceilings, stability fees, and rates with a single call now rather than all of the boilerplate we had before.   LucasManuel: Another good thing was to abstract away a lot of the \u201cDaiwanese\u201d so outside community members can just call these functions, they\u2019re called like setGlobalDebtCeiling instead of creasefat.line   BrianMcMichael: Much clearer Dai.     Thanks, guys. Let\u2019s see, so we didn\u2019t do a lot of work on the priority sheet. Last week, most of that was done, but we adjusted the weights in the priority sheet slightly.   We did a domain team review of MIP22. The results of that are in the forum post for MIP22.   In the coming week, we\u2019re going to get YFI into Kovan using that new documentation, which actually will probably be done by the end of this week.   Next week, we\u2019re hoping to put YFI and BAL into the executive for next Friday, so we\u2019ll be doing the mainnet spell crafting on that. We\u2019ll probably end up going with GUSD to Kovan next week as well. We have a monthly executive, which I think maybe someone will probably discuss in more detail. However, we have to craft that for Monday.   More broadly, we\u2019re still planning on doing the UNI, REN, BTC, and TBTC assessments. Additionally, we still have to do domain team reviews of MIP14, 17, and 25.   We are continuing to work on liquidations 2.0 trying to get it to be code-complete. Discussions have begun with auditors.   LongForWisdom Oracle Team Update 10:57  Nik is in listen-only mode. So I\u2019ll just cover the brief update for oracles. I think the only major thing of note is that the oracle polls for the B.Protocol whitelisting on the OSM and Medianizer ETH-USD feeds have passed the polls. They should be in the executive this week.  Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 12:00   This week, Marco from our team published GUSD and PAXG collateral evaluations. We should proceed with an on-chain poll and executive vote soon   We\u2019re also focusing on new assets to be evaluated. It seems that the Aave migration was kind of successful, although still not completely finished. It seems the new token has sufficient liquidity and was also listed on other platforms, which makes us more confident to start with evaluation on our end. As mentioned last week, UNISWAP was highly ranked on the priority sheet, so a member of our team already started working on a collateral evaluation for it. As already mentioned, REN-BTC and REN are also being evaluated by new external analysts.   The most significant thing in my mind this week was a rate change proposal that LongForWisdom mentioned. There was also one post by me, proposing rates, of course, co-authored by other great group members. As Long mentioned, this post for a general framework will deliver these kinds of posts regularly, and that\u2019s already explained the plan of this release was mostly to demonstrate our decision-making process. Therefore we didn\u2019t make any changes to rates apart from potential changes needed for stablecoins.   Regarding stablecoins, there was a signal poll made by Sam, as already mentioned, so please vote on that one, so we get more feedback from the community about the strategy regarding stablecoin fees. Finally, I want to quickly say there\u2019s work in progress on real-world assets on the risk side. In the background, Sebastian and Will have been doing a really great job for the last couple of weeks, producing a lot of materials for risk. I think we\u2019re moving ahead at a really decent pace.   Amy Jung Community Development + Operational Support Update 14:48   Not much to update for governance; we have some initiatives not ready to be announced yet.   We are looking to do more communications and announcements around new vault types as they come about.   Generally, there are a few initiatives that the community has been working on:   The Dai-rectory, a directory of retail merchants that accept Dai.   The Dai LatAM Action group had a successful 3-month pilot.   POAP NFTs for contributor recognition.   Exploring a MakerDAO-form podcast for voters.   We onboarded the grantee Valante POS system, making it easier for merchants to generate tax-compliant invoices.     Juan Collateral Call Update 17:02 1354\u00d7638 67.9 KB  This is the update for the collateral onboarding calls in general and collateral more in general.  1352\u00d7644 101 KB  Yesterday we had an interesting call with Stasis. They were presenting EuroStasis(EURS), the euro-backed stablecoin. We then we had the people from crypto.com. The notes are already on the forum, so if you want to check them out, thanks to Pablo, mainly for the notes\u2019 quick turnover.  1358\u00d7636 84.9 KB  Next week, we\u2019re going to have ConsolFreight for the real-world assets. They\u2019re going to explain what they do, how they work, and their partnership with Centrifuge. We\u2019re expecting an exciting call there, we\u2019re also going to have Curve Finance.  1364\u00d7714 126 KB  The collateral onboarding framework is going to be posted in the forum today. Basically, it brings the different domain teams and working groups together to collaborate on the collateral onboarding.  1370\u00d7714 68.3 KB  This brings me to another point: if you are good at risk or data analytics, please talk to Primoz; I\u2019m sure he will appreciate the help. Same thing with oracle if you\u2019re interested, speak to Nik, and if you\u2019re any good with smart contracts and, I guess solidity speak with Chris Mooney.  1372\u00d7650 111 KB  And if you\u2019re good at all three of them, there\u2019s the fellowship that the Maker foundation announced with Kleros.  1360\u00d7716 82.7 KB   More help wanted any developers full-stack or comms people to reach out to Tim or Amy.   If you\u2019re looking to get involved in governance reach out to LongForWisdom   If you want to be a scribe and help with the note-taking, reach out to David, and I think that\u2019s it from my side.   Questions   Chris: Yes, I was just wondering. I kind of asked this in the forums, but crypto.com\u2019s liquidity for Dai is pretty low. I was interested if they plan on using their CRO token to provide more liquidity on their exchange if we were to add it as collateral because I assume they have CRO reserves that they would sort of pivot into DAI liquidity on their exchange. Still, they answered pretty broadly in the forums, but I wasn\u2019t sure if they had touched on that at all in the collateral onboarding call.  Juan: They did speak a little bit, but we did not go a lot into detail. I guess the Q&A wasn\u2019t particularly structured, but yeah, we can try asking again in the forums, I guess; sorry to not have a better answer, Chris.    Frank Cruz: I have a quick question, that company that\u2019s greenlighting right now that\u2019s in real estate, OST-1, did they ever come on your show? If so, do you remember when so that I could look at it because I\u2019m having a hard time trying to figure out what exactly they do.   Juan: Which company?   LongForWisdom: OST One, I believe they\u2019re out to boost an LP or something.   Frank Cruz: Yeah, the one that\u2019s trying to build the building or they\u2019re trying to buy one apartment or something.   LongForWisdom: Uprets is the group.   Juan: I cannot remember having them, so I don\u2019t think so, I\u2019ll check David\u2019s link, but I do not remember having them. No, they did not, I don\u2019t think, or maybe it was one of the first ones, but I can not remember them, to be honest.   LongForWisdom: I don\u2019t think they have, from what I can remember.   David: They look pretty active in the forums; their last response was 14 hours ago.   Juan: I mean, we can always invite them if they have not yet presented.   Frank Cruz: That would be interesting if you could.   Juan: Yes, let\u2019s reach out.     Charles St. Louis MIPs Update 22:49 1494\u00d7801 153 KB 1472\u00d7817 192 KB 1497\u00d7807 156 KB 1479\u00d7821 188 KB 1485\u00d7824 164 KB 1470\u00d7820 205 KB   As far as the proposals currently in the RFC phase, it\u2019s been a busy October. It\u2019s going to be a busy November, pending that all the authors of these proposals intend to submit them for November. It should be noted that the proposals that have entered the RFC phase are the same as last week:   MIP17, which is a rewrite of the original one that was looking at DC adjustments as well as RP adjustments. However, this one is now proposed by PlanetX, and it\u2019s only for the weekly actual DC adjustments. I highly recommend checking that out, looking at the logic, and seeing if people agree is how we should move forward.   MIP24 is an emergency response system proposed by John Athman recently updated by David Utro, which was presented a couple of weeks ago. It should be eligible for November. LongForWisdom and I have made some comments in the post, but we\u2019ll follow up with others. Still, if you want to submit this proposal for November, you should make sure all the changes have been made by October 28th.   We have the MIP25 Flash Mint Module by Sam, and that was a follow-up to the declarations of intent for creating a flash module for Maker. This is the technical implementation of that intent.   Next, we have the MIP26, which is the Governance contract redesign, called DSS-Gov. It includes a vote delegation functionality.   Then, there is the MIP 27 Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module, which you can think of as an automated version of MIP17, although there are some differences. So if you\u2019re looking at MIP27, then you should look at MIP17 to compare and see if the manual processes transfer over to the automatic one.   There\u2019s MIP28 operational support domain definitions ultimately defines the entire support domain. If it were to be approved, what the actions the domain would take in helping facilitate and running the DAO.   In terms of sub-proposals, we had a source cred funding proposal.   We had another sub-proposal as a follow-up to MIP28 to onboard Amy as a support facilitator.   There is the sub-proposal for calendar exceptions, which is an amendment to potentially skip, for lack of a better term, the December governance cycle given that a lot of people are away and not as many people will be paying attention during that time.     1515\u00d7802 117 KB   Lastly, we have a couple of pre-MIP discussions. The new ones are there was one for MakerDAO that needs liquidity pools, so some conversations are going on there. The one mentioned earlier in the call and posted in the chat by Amy was to make your protocol cover using nexus mutual and the not so new ones. The first one is the flapper distributor. This is a way to distribute system surplus while minimizing governance processes. Then there\u2019s the proposal idea for replacing the mechanism to burn MKR with the treasury, which has had some excellent discussions and debates.   It\u2019s been a busy October, and it\u2019s going to be a busy November. LongForWisdom and I have commented on MIP24; all the changes need to be done by October 28th to leave that one week frozen period before formal submission.   ",

There\u2019s no reason for it not to continue. Therefore, it will be in the monthly executive on Monday, which, as Charles mentioned, needs to pass in four days to be considered ratified, so look forward to that on the 26th.  Other Presentations and Updates Derek Flossman Governance Portal Improvements 30:04   I\u2019ll do a little walkthrough of the governance portal. First of all, I want to give a shoutout to the foundation team who worked on this. The developers and Jordan and Mike, on our design team, helped us pull this fantastic new site together.   So, the structure of the site is split into three different pages. Basically, you\u2019ve got a landing page, polling page, and executive page. The landing page introduces tabs that show the new polling votes. On Monday, the new executive vote label will be showing up here as well. We\u2019ve put in a label just linking back to the v1 governance site, so that still exists and will still be out there if people want to use it for whatever reason, using it as a fallback.   1139\u00d7852 107 KB 1019\u00d7680 35.4 KB   A lot of the research that came up was making sure we have all that information in this space. The system stats, the link to Dai stats, links to the forum community tools, link to governance blog posts were all included. And surfacing executive votes and polling votes on the front page that link through to the polls and executive page.   There was a lot of emphases to make sure we\u2019re surfacing the right information. Long, I know we were talking about something in that space regarding the sort of information that we show here and how this could be potentially discussed and walkthrough to figure out what makes the most sense for people. So definitely jump in at any time on this call or use the Rocketchat #governance-and-risk channel to provide any input that you may have. I\u2019m definitely looking forward to hearing from you guys. We have a backlog list that we\u2019re working through, so it\u2019s ongoing work, and improvements are still to be made.   1160\u00d7853 119 KB  Moving on to the polling page, the big update here, of course, is the batch polling, so I\u2019m pretty happy with the way this has turned out. Feedback so far is pretty positive about being able to batch votes together. I see we\u2019ve just had all the other polls gone through us, not active anymore, so you\u2019ll see those are split down here between ended poles and active poles. What you can now do is vote through the overview page add those to your ballot. You\u2019ll see that the ballot recognizes that you\u2019ve added to it, and the counter goes up.  1202\u00d7770 125 KB  The cool thing is that you can also go in a review of the text. Of course, suppose you\u2019re not familiar with what the vote is. In that case, you can also vote, add that to your ballot, your ballot will record that, and you can go back to here to the active polls page and review what you voted on.  1146\u00d7750 101 KB  And then review and submit will show you the overview of that participation. You can then submit your ballot. The gas prices have been pretty good from what I\u2019ve seen, so this is really an interim step when you guys signaled that you were interested in the snapshot solution. In due course, we will be working on that. Still, this seems to be a pretty good solution when we have so many concurrent polls at the same time, so yeah.  1144\u00d7759 110 KB   And also, what I will mention it was a design decision that we made. You will remember that we originally had the vote breakdown in the right-hand column. There were many pros and cons of discussion around whether we should retain that. Many people wanted to see where the interest was because it swayed them. Still, for others, the fact that they were swayed was a detractor. It influenced the way they would vote as opposed to independently having a point of view. We thought, okay, let\u2019s move it from that front page of the poll detail and put it behind the tab. That was the rationale, so again if people believe that extra clickthrough for the use case of viewing that is sort of in the way or not ideal, definitely let me know. We\u2019ll see what we can do based on the feedback we get. Oh, and we have the total votes and unique voters. Not sure we had all of that detail in the previous portal.   Another thing to mention we have filter capability, so at the moment, it\u2019s by pole type. I\u2019ve categorized these poll types. We just need to import that list. You\u2019ll be able to filter on different variables such as oracles, risk variables, collateral onboarding, etc. Then also a date filter that lets you reduce down to a period of time just to make it a little bit easier to find what you\u2019re looking for in the wealth of polls that exist.   1200\u00d7762 106 KB  Moving on to executive proposals, I don\u2019t think anything is different in the card itself; we still retain and show the same information. I voted on this one, so I can\u2019t do so again. I am connected with my wallet, but I could view a previous one. The nice thing with this is that we were only showing the latest proposal and not all the others on the old proposal. The cool thing here is that you can, of course, see the amount of MKR in support, so you can see how much is on the hat, what are the other competing proposals, or which MKR has not moved and gives a bit better of an overview of actually what the status of the system is. We\u2019ve retained, of course, the proposal detail that the governance facilitator documents. We\u2019ve added the on-chain effects, which are very similar to what you will recognize from the cap flip. Just be aware that this is only for the JUG and VAT contracts; we will be working on expanding this out and include the other MCD contracts that are impacted. So just be aware of that, and then, of course, you can click through to the link. This link used to be in the right-hand column, but we moved it into the on-chain effects section.  1214\u00d7794 104 KB  And, of course, favorite requests from everyone have been the comments. So if I were to vote on a proposal, you will, of course, be able to add in your comment in here, submit it, sign it with your wallet, and that will then appear in the comments field where that the community can read and review. This will hopefully make it a bit more transparent as to why people are voting a certain way. The information included in that also shows how much that particular commenter has in terms of MKR, hopefully making it a bit clearer for people to see why decisions are going a certain way.  1204\u00d7696 113 KB   Chris Mooney?: So, for a new executive that\u2019s coming, is there still a section where it references how much MKR is needed to move to the next hat? I know you already voted on that one, so I don\u2019t know if it would otherwise be there.   Derek: Yes, it will say how much more is required to become the hat, yes. So in the old portal, we would have said \u201camount required to pass.\u201d I believe we do still have that if that\u2019s what you\u2019re were referring to.   Chris Mooney?: Yeah, thank you.     1130\u00d7674 96.7 KB 1073\u00d7615 100 KB   Yeah, so let me know what you guys think; I think that\u2019s my very brief overview of the three pages and likewise looking for all the feedback you have. Long, I saw your document, and we\u2019ve got a list of improvements that we\u2019re working through as a backlog, hoping to add to that and get it looking good across the board.  LongForWisdom: Great, thanks very much, Derek, that was awesome. Thanks so much to you and all the people who worked on it; it\u2019s a significant improvement, I think. Hopefully, this new portal will mean that people more consistently vote on everything because what we\u2019ve always seen before is that people tend to vote on the more controversial things than ordinary stuff. Still, with this new system, they\u2019ll be able to vote on everything for the same amount of gas and, hopefully, a similar amount of effort or less effort.    Derek: Hoping to see participation in the polls go up; I know it\u2019s actually been pretty good. When I was looking over the numbers, it was plus or minus a few percent difference across polls. Definitely, the more controversial ones got more attention but hopefully, this way, streamline that participation will be helpful for people.   Discussion & Questions 40:32   David: I wanted to quickly just ask the question because I just want to make sure it\u2019s covered here; I already kind of know the answer because you came on the community call on Tuesday, but there is a comment capability for executives, and I know that there\u2019s no comment capability for governance polls. Can you give just a brief update on whether that\u2019s in the plan?   Derek: Yeah, and I know roone commented on that earlier in the week in the RocketChat channel as well; we haven\u2019t planned on it, to be honest, but if there is a request for it and people want to see it, there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t add it. We prioritize the executives because there was a lot of discussion in the forum and the polls specifically. It was a little unclear as to what people\u2019s sentiment was around the executive, so we prioritize that first. We can certainly look to do the same for the poles no reason why not. If there\u2019s an appetite for it, absolutely.   David: Sweet, thanks so much.   Derek: Alright, I guess I wanted to see how it was going to go with the executives and what sort of feedback and value we got from it before we put some dev time towards it but let\u2019s see how it goes, and then I\u2019ll give you guys a shout out when we think we\u2019re gonna jump to get that in as well but the things that we have coming up, of course, we\u2019ve got the new governance contract so that\u2019s going to require a rewrite of the executive page to support multiple concurrent executives and that, of course, brings in some work around delegation which will change the interface again. There will also be instant access modules once we get past MIP17 and 26 or 27; I can\u2019t remember anymore, but there will be ongoing updates and improvements. Still, that stuff is coming down the line, so it will keep us busy.     LongForWisdom: Great, yeah, thanks very much, Derek. That was awesome. I\u2019m looking forward to using it more. Kenton just asked when are we switching to snapshot voting? I don\u2019t think we\u2019re planning to switch to it immediately; I don\u2019t believe there are plans to change. We\u2019re kind of just investigating integrating it with the current portal, right Derek?  Derek: Exactly, yes, we\u2019re investigating integrating it with the portal, whether it will be side by side or complete replacement of the polling that we have is TBD based on that we have work to do to ensure that we can support rank choice voting which they do not currently support, so there\u2019s a little bit more work to do on it. I wouldn\u2019t put a date on it yet, but as soon as we get closer, that code\u2019s all public, so you guys will see when those improvements get done that we can start looking to integrate.    Juan Collateral Prioritization Framework 44:13 800\u00d7445 74.5 KB  Just to give you a little bit of background on what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019ve mentioned this in previous calls. This framework was modeled to prioritize different collateral types in the most possibly objective way to see intelligent discussions. We do not believe that it\u2019s perfect by any means but rather as a living document. I think it will get better with time. It was made mainly to allow domain teams/working groups and external contributors to overview the collateral types, their onboarding status, and the different characteristics. We also wanted to provide transparency to the broader community and a common ground for discussions and potential future collaboration. Ideally, with this, everyone will see what\u2019s coming, how things are being prioritized, and why, and understand more what\u2019s going on with each collaborator.  1494\u00d7782 341 KB   I\u2019m going to publish a post in the forum with the Google sheet, which is what I\u2019m going to show right now.   Regarding how to read the frameworks, this will be on the forums, so don\u2019t worry too much. Basically, the first row is each team responsible for filling each parameter. Row number two is the weight that each parameter will have for the scoring. And row number three will be each parameter. Everything green is a benefit or a good thing, and the things that have a red background is a little bit of a \u201ccost.\u201d The green light score was taken from the amount of Maker approved in each greenlight poll, and then it was normalized between minus 16 and plus 16. Why the minus 16 and plus 16? When each domain team or working group chooses between low, medium, high and extreme, you get one, two, three, four square, which means you get one, four, nine, sixteen. That\u2019s why the greenlight score is normalized between those values. Once everything is calculated, we multiply the values that I just mentioned by the weight. We add them and what we do to calculate the prioritization score. We subtract all the costs minus the benefits times the weight. So we do the sum-product, then we do the subtraction, and we end up with this list of collateral types, with this order.   We should think about some considerations. This is a model, so it\u2019s an imperfect representation of reality. We believe that some data is better than no data; each team\u2019s input is subjective and reflects the instance of their current knowledge, so they might change their mind as soon as they investigate more. The weights will get adjusted with time, so we\u2019re looking forward to getting feedback regarding that.   There are some things, for example, these pooled collateral types, they are quite difficult. Still, we believe, for example, that if they were treated simultaneously, once you do the first, the rest should be relatively straightforward, so there are more considerations than just taking the prioritization score at face value.   1081\u00d7786 251 KB   Some potential improvements we thought about are adjusting the weight-tweaking into new parameters if needed. So if you guys think there\u2019s a benefit or cost that we\u2019re not considering, please let us know, maybe add a definition of the parameters, so everyone understands the same thing. And ideally, each domain team or working group would draft documents to allow contributors to help even if they come from outside. This will help scale and onboard more collateral types if that\u2019s what the protocol and the maker holders want. And then we also thought about having a better UI for visualization and maybe for data entry and modification, so perhaps a nicer dashboard. And again, any feedback proposed is more than welcome; I\u2019ll post this later today. So I\u2019m going to open it for questions?   LongForWisdom: Not a question, but do you want to briefly cover the status tab as well?   Juan: Yes, sure. So this is, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a replacement for the collateral status index forum post, is it?   LongForWisdom: I\u2019d like it to be a replacement because it\u2019s easier to keep up to date than the collateral status index.   Juan: Sure, so the collateral status index that Long was maintaining in the forum was moved here. So this is where the greenlight score was calculated and normalized. I don\u2019t know if I mentioned anything that does not have a greenlight score yet; no, was it yellow? I forgot, Long, sorry.   LongForWisdom: Yes, yellow hasn\u2019t had a greenlight poll yet. The number comes from\u2026   Juan: Oh yeah, yeah, so that\u2019s why the yellow ones have all the same numbers, it\u2019s because we\u2019re taking it as if they got zero, so nothing in favor and nothing against. This is where the domain teams or working groups will post their work to access it easily. Yeah, I mean, a Google sheet is the best way of doing things. Still, it was the fastest way for us to get something that works and hopefully provide value faster than developing something if we don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to use it. Any questions?     Discussion & Questions 51:25   Frank Cruz: Hey, Juan. I guess I\u2019m having a little trouble understanding the diversification score. How does yEarn have a low diversification score, and Gemini USD has a high, and so does TUSD have a high as well? Is this a diversification towards DAI or what?   Juan: Primoz, would you like to comment on it, or I can try too?   Primoz: Normally, it should be diversification in terms of collateral; in this case, I\u2019m not sure why they\u2019re high. I think the idea was that cUSDC is a bit different versus yUSDC in terms that you have a Compound platform risk, so it should be looked at differently as something like the YY curve.   Juan: Thank you, Primoz, are there any other questions? Alright, I\u2019ll give it to you, Long.     LongForWisdom: Sound good, so I\u2019ll just reiterate, as Juan said, this is going to be public soon, the link will be comment enabled, so if anyone has comments on individual scores, you\u2019ll be able to just leave them in the sheet, and someone will read them. Hopefully, someone should read them. We\u2019re looking at the sheet probably weekly or monthly, so all of this stuff will get looked at, and every time new assets get onboarded. This should be reasonably high traffic in terms of people looking at it. Thank you for that, Juan. I look forward to seeing that public and see if anyone else has individual feedback on individual things.

That accounts for the entire DSR quantity right now.  793\u00d7474 50.4 KB  Curve has an 87 million total.  1418\u00d7834 179 KB   Uniswap tops the list.   Binance has 30 million.   Overall of the total supply, minus Compound, you\u2019ve got ~600 million or so sitting ins taking pools and lending protocols. The remaining amount is held by exchange pools or wallets and individual users.   1516\u00d7586 81.3 KB  For current risk distribution. In market risk, ETH is the most giant pool subject to market volatility fluctuations. There has been a decrease in the lowest CR bucket. Primarily due to ETH going up. It\u2019s following a standard curve of around 250%.  1495\u00d7674 119 KB   At ETH $320/318, that would be 30 million liquidated.   $280 is still the middle point, now with a giant wall of 100 million, it\u2019s almost a meme. The last few times we\u2019ve looked, it\u2019s always the most prominent wall. Something where vault holders look and manage against. Beyond that price, it\u2019s a continuous curve\u2014lots of those vault holders, pools exchanges, etc. Individual users slope out from there.   That\u2019s a positive caveat on the risk profile, in the sense that the larger positions have a logic below them. The percentage is managed at least.   1517\u00d7769 182 KB   I\u2019m starting to pull data on all the positions for all the collateral assets. Will push this to the website and graphs soon.   New URL for this coming soon.   BAT, for example, has two vaults that account for the majority of the positions. You can see these two vault majority across several asset types.   COMP as well.   ETH-B saw an uptick.   1514\u00d7692 211 KB  PAX\u2019s biggest is 12.6 million. It sits at 100.6 CR.  1506\u00d7837 252 KB  Collateral requirement mark. In most massive vaults, the liquidation price is at a dollar. Which means they are right at the point of liquidation. I know that\u2019s been important lately, so I\u2019d be happy to share that.  Open Discussion 1:07:19   LongForWisdom: We can have a brief Q&A. If anyone has any comments or questions about any of the things we\u2019ve seen in the call thus far, feel free to chime in.   BrianMcMichael: Hey Long, I might add I did post a forum post late last week about the new DSS chain log, so if there are any developers on the call, we do have a single contract on mainnet Kovan and then also our Ropsten and Rinkeby deployments that you can point your smart contracts to and test against the chain log. Our current website at changelog.makerdao.com has the keys. It basically provides a way to get the contract addresses for the MCD system from an on-chain source rather than relying on a hosted document. If anyone has any questions about that, let me know or send me a message privately.   LongForWisdom: Yeah, I think that\u2019s great; this would also be useful if I\u2019m correct in having governance audit executive votes or executive spells as well, right?  Because they can compare that the contracts modified in the spell are the same as those in the DSS the chain log, right?   Brian: Yeah, so you can pass it a parameter the MCD-VAT, and it will return the vat address on that particular network. It might be useful for smart contract developers and auditing and UI developers who want to develop for both Kovan and mainnet. You can just point to the chain log address and code in your keys for the particular contracts. That\u2019s really all you need to do. It\u2019ll return the correct contract, and then you can request information from that contract rather than having to hard code those addresses in there.   Christopher Mooney: Basically, a DNS for us.   LongForWisdom: Right, it is governance managed, so we\u2019ll probably be updating those; when we add new collateral types, we\u2019ll add those in the executive spell. Currently, the smart contracts team does have access to modify that contract with our deployer key. However, once we get this fully integrated into our processes and everybody\u2019s aware of the need to make these updates, we can deny that, deploy our key, and give governance full access to create updates and delete keys in that.   LongForWisdom: Great, yeah, that sounds really useful; thanks for mentioning that. All right, so I think we\u2019re across the hour, so I think we\u2019ll maybe do a kind of the last call for reminders. Juan, do you want to just mention the Kleros cool again?     Juan: Federico, we\u2019ll be joining in 14 minutes from Kleros to speak about the fellowship with the Maker foundation, so if you\u2019re interested, I\u2019ll see you there.   LongForWisdom: I want to remind people that the onboarding polls for GUSD and PAXG will be on-chain on Monday next week. Thanks to everyone for coming, and  I\u2019ll see you all again next week.

We\u2019re posting a high-level overview of the Governance and Risk call ahead of the high fidelity call summary very week. Team Updates Smart Contracts  The smart contracts team reviewed MIP 22: Centrifuge Direct Liquidation Module. Last week the team worked on the ETH-B executive. YFI onto kovan this/next week, YFI and BAL going into executive next week. Began discussions with auditors for Liquidations 2.0.  Oracles  Oracle polls for whitelisting B.Protocol (MIP10c9-SP12 and MIP10c9-SP13) passed and will be in executive upcoming week.  Risk   GUSD and PAXG risk assessments published on the forum. The rate setting working group shared the framework they\u2019re using to approach rate setting. Check out the [Signal Request] Stablecoin Action Plan   Operations and Community Development   DAI-rectory initiative in the works to bring awareness to merchants accepting DAI.  LATAM action group formed an ambassador group to bring awareness in Latin America. Proof of attendance NFTs (POAPs) for community member participation in the works. Onboarded another Grantee - Valente POS, a point of sales system that makes it easy for merchants to generate tax compliant invoices (particularly AFIP (Argentine IRS))  Collateral Onboarding   Collateral Onboarding Framework is live on the forum! Previous call with STATIS and Crypto.com call replay and notes are up in the forum. Next week join us October 28 for a discussion with ConsolFreight at 17 UTC and Curve Finance at 18 UTC  Help wanted, reach out to @primoz for Risk, @NikKunkel  for Oracles and @cmooney for Smart Contracts  MIPs  Monthly MIPs Governance Poll that included 8 proposals passed and Executive Vote will be published on Monday October 26. Tentative Executive Vote to add YFI and BAL to the protocol scheduled for next Friday. Community Greenlight polls are live for another week, go vote, it\u2019s easier now.  Other Presentations and Updates   @hexonaut announced the launch of https://www.mkranalytics.com - a tool for viewing time series data from the Maker protocol.  @derek presented the new Governance Portal redesign and there\u2019s a replay of the deep dive presentation from the community call.  Peg  DAI price fluctuating around $1.01, like the past month or so, there is lots of discussions around how comfortable everyone is with that price off peg. The DAI supply rises to around 930 million. New vaults risk stats for other collateral types on the way. You can see in that data that there is a trend for two large vaults in many other collaterals.  ",

Welcome to the MakerDAO scientific Governance and Risk meeting number #114 taking place on Thursday, October 15th, at 16:00 UTC. My name is LongForWisdom. I\u2019m MakerDAO\u2019s Governance Facilitator. A bunch of Maker people joins me as usual. I don\u2019t think we have anything super exciting for today\u2019s agenda\u2014just the standard updates, including the MIP stuff, state of the peg, and an open discussion.   I want to give a quick reminder about time-zones. It\u2019s the time of year when people start switching time zones. This meeting is set for 16:00 UTC, which means the time will change for people outside UTC. Just be aware of that over the next few weeks.   We are currently working on better documentation for the system parameters that we frequently change, such as collateralization ratios, debt ceilings, and stability fees. I don\u2019t know how many people here will get much out of them. Still, I\u2019m hoping it will be easier for new users to pick up signals and governance decisions that involve those parameters if they have something to read, which will help them understand the tradeoffs with those parameters.   Deeper discussions happen in the Forum.   Governance LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 01:17 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated. Discussions   MakerDAO Should Begin Moving Away from The Dollar  Nanook posted a thread suggesting that MakerDAO should start moving away from the dollar, which prompted some discussion. Various people are chiming in on the dollar\u2019s benefits over something like the SDR and vice-versa, which is interesting.    Liquidations 2.0: Technical Summary  I\u2019m going to highlight the liquidations 2.0 technical summary that Chris posted. Chris Mooney from the smart contracts team posted it the other week and continues to promote a discussion, which is good because the more we can discuss liquidations, the better it will turn out.    Wanted: Governance Help  I also need to highlight that there is still help wanted for governance people. If you are interested in contributing to Governance with an end the goal for finding more Governance facilitators, please, let me know. I can find something for you to do, and we can discuss it.    Signal Requests   Increase the Auction Surplus Buffer by 2 million (System Surplus)  Primoz from the risk team proposed-The first increase in the surplus buffer by 2 million.    Approve Maker Representatives as an oversight role for Real-World Assets  A signal request from Matt Rabinowitz proposes a list of initial Maker representatives as described in his MIP related to onboarding. I would encourage people to vote on those before Friday and when it goes on-chain on Monday.    Add ETH-B Vault Collateral Type  I also wanted to highlight that the ETH-B vault collateral type passed on-chain and should be going into the executive tomorrow. I\u2019m sure Chris will be able to tell you more about this.    Weekly Updates Chris Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 04:28   We did not have an executive vote last week, which is the first time in; I don\u2019t even know if I remember the last time we didn\u2019t have a weekly executive. There are no parameters changed; it was pretty crazy. I mentioned last week that we\u2019re slated to look at PAXG to do a collateral assessment, but that was incorrect because befitsandpiper did a collateral assessment on PAXG back in July, so that\u2019s already complete. We just deployed ETH-B to Kovan, so if you\u2019re a keeper, integrator, UI, or you want to test it, it\u2019s out on Kovan. That\u2019s the pull request right now. You can find the address there. We\u2019ll update the changelog.   There was some work on a tool between Brian and Lucas. They\u2019re working on something called the Chainlog, a play on words for the changelog, and I think that\u2019s complete. I don\u2019t know if either one of you guys is on the call if you wanted to give a brief update or if you\u2019re going to save that for a presentation later but\u2026 (checks to see if they\u2019re in the call). No, I think they\u2019re still in an L2 call.   We did a little bit of work on the collateral onboarding sheet. Lucas tried to give them a sort of gut check on the assessments there, which hopefully starts to kind of complete that sheet; someone else will probably present the sheet later.   We moved the joint adapters that were in DSS deploy over to DSS gem joins. This is to help with collateral onboarding, and so doing that, Sam and I were onboarding Balancer trying to walk through getting it installed on Kovan using that documentation. There\u2019s a whole bunch of new collateral necessary documentation that will be coming, and Balancer is sort of halfway to Kovan right now. We\u2019re still walking through that, so I\u2019d expect that next week.   We also covered Liquidations 2.0. We had a discussion yesterday about it; I don\u2019t know if we need to have more of these. Please post any questions you might have there or if we have time at the end of the call, just bring up any questions.   There was some discussion about the peg, which is a way for the protocol to remediate people. We did a little bit of work with that trying to accommodate some of the requests that we\u2019ve had. I know it\u2019s not formally submitted yet, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on.   In the coming week, we\u2019ll expect an ETH-B Vault on Mainnet, which will happen tomorrow. Then we expect to get BAL totally on Kovan, YFI on Kovan, and then GUSD on Kovan, though that may not happen next week, probably the week after.   We\u2019re still working on collateral assessments for UNI, RUN, VPC, and TBTC, and we need to do a domain team review of MIPs 14, 17, 22, and 25. Just to set expectations, for the next two weeks, the Foundation\u2019s smart contracts team is trying to get a sort of code complete for liquidations 2.0. Most of our resources will ensure that code is complete to send it off to auditors and whatnot.   Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 08:47   We\u2019re finalizing GUSD and package evaluations. They should be posted in the upcoming days by Marco.   We\u2019ll also start focusing on new assets to be evaluated. We mostly rely on this new prioritization sheet that was more or less filled on our end. According to some preliminary results, Uniswap and REN tokens rank pretty high we already started assigning these evaluations to our new analysts.   We\u2019re also finalizing a collateral evaluation template, which should help us with onboarding new analysts. People will just mostly need to follow the steps and make evaluations. Of course, they need to have some decent knowledge about the space. In general, I think this should attract many more analysts willing to do this kind of work in the future.   I made a post that LongForWisdom mentioned already about increasing surplus buffer to 4 million, which should hopefully go to on-chain vote this Monday.   We are also preparing a table with risk premiums and competitive rates for each asset. Monet Supply and I are working on this. This thing will be published next week along with the report from the rate-setting working group about potential rate changes. We don\u2019t really plan to propose massive changes to rates in the upcoming week, but the whole idea is to demonstrate to the Governance the new format we intend to report changes to rates and its thought process. Ideally, this should lead to less overhead with Governance making rate changes and make rates more predictable and stable.   Finally, there\u2019s a one really great tool that our community member Lix made; this was based on our wanted post where we were looking for someone who can perform the on-chain analysis to reveal how real-world users are utilizing their DAI in various liquidity mining venues. The whole point of this was to better understand our users and address liquidation risks because if users are long DAI, those risks are much lower. We got some really cool results; they should be published on forums by Lix. Potentially he might also come to the next governance call and present some of the stats.   Amy Jung Community Development Team Update 12:00   It\u2019s going to be pretty short this week. We just announced our Kleros and Maker fellowship. If you guys don\u2019t know what Kleros is, Kleros is a decentralized decision-making protocol. A critical use case for them has been to focus on verifying compliance around crypto assets, so that\u2019s great for us. In the fellowship, the fellow would be working on a framework that helps assess the code risk profile and legal compliance. This is a six-month fellowship for someone interested, ideally a researcher, so feel free to share with anyone you think might be interested. I think the applications are closing in about two weeks, and we\u2019ve already got some great applicants.   The second piece is that we will be launching a grants platform soon, so hopefully, this will help get some great and more transparent grant applications in the pipeline, and people will be able to view them. Anyone in the community would be able to view them as well.   Most of my time has been spent working on this growth-focused minimum operational framework that I mentioned. It\u2019s almost ready for feedback in maybe two weeks. That\u2019s going to include a budget and incentive proposal and some kind of roadmap in the general timeframe for what implementation might look like and guidance documents.   Just a reminder, we try to upload our public calls as soon as they are done, usually around the same day or so.   Suppose you\u2019re interested in what community development has been building, we did a demo day on last week\u2019s community call.   Our liquidations 2.0 Stakeholder discussion call is up too. The collateral onboarding calls as well.   I\u2019m going to hand over to David, who has a quick message about the governance call summary team.  David: Thank you so much, Amy; as some of you know, we produce a high fidelity summary of this call, in particular, the Thursday call, and so we are looking for people in the community who are interested in helping us produce those. We have a couple of people taking live notes; for example, Juan and my buddy Pavel are both working on them for this call right now. We also have a QA role available. Suppose you or anybody you know is interested. In that case, this is a really great way to earn a little bit of DAI and impact the community by helping to produce a great archivable resource for anybody looking at these governance calls. So yeah, feel free to reach out to me on RocketChat; It\u2019s @David.u. Or just join us in the Gov call summaries channel on rocketchat and voice your interest there. I\u2019ll happily onboard you and put you on to how we do things. Thanks, Amy.    LongForWisdom: Anybody has any questions? I would just like to say that I get to see the summary guys working on the stuff each week. They are very diligent at doing it and getting everything sorted out, so a big thanks to those people for doing that. If you\u2019re interested, please get in touch with David.   Juan Collateral Call Update 16:11 1686\u00d7856 124 KB  Regarding collateral onboarding, as I think Primoz mentioned it, or maybe it was Chris, we are working on a framework that I think we\u2019ll publish on Monday if everything goes well, but I\u2019m very excited to see how it progressed. Here\u2019s a very short preview.  1664\u00d7856 254 KB  Regarding the calls, we had an exciting call yesterday with REN and Uniswap. So Loong Wang from RenVM and Hayden from Uniswap came and answered some interesting questions and had great debates. If you want to see the video, it\u2019s already up in the forum; Amy posted it. The notes are coming soon; I think Gala and Pablo are already working on them.  1266\u00d7706 207 KB  Next Wednesday, on the 21st at 5 p.m UTC, we\u2019ll have Gregory Klumov from Stasis speak for EURS and then we\u2019ll have the Crypto.com team joining us as well. Join us, bring your questions and see you all there.  1264\u00d7712 137 KB  Coming soon, but I don\u2019t want to give any project away until it\u2019s confirmed. I want to talk about a couple of very interesting projects. I hope to have something confirmed very soon, and if you guys know someone who might be interested in joining us and presenting their project, please reach out either to them or me. We\u2019ll gladly talk to them to organize something.  1264\u00d7696 70.8 KB Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 18:31   Apologies for being late; I had to wrap something up. Regarding updates on the oracle domain team side, you know we did the work for BAL and YFI. Oracle assessments are underway; in terms of the release package, we\u2019re deep into testing now, and we\u2019re kind of slated to start releasing that into production in about a week. We\u2019d probably need a week to do the production deployment from there, so I think that\u2019s perhaps the biggest bottleneck for collateral onboarding of YFI and BAL, but I believe we are on track to do it by the end of the month.   In terms of the status of other work we\u2019ve been doing, I think I\u2019ve mentioned this in a few comments on the forum and talked to a couple of you, but we\u2019ve been working on a Uniswap LP Token Oracle. So that contract is looking pretty solid at the moment. We\u2019re starting to get some more formalized reviews, so I\u2019ve asked Hayden to take a look at it. We\u2019ve had conversations with Lev as well where he said he wanted to potentially take a look. I think the idea is that after a round of incorporating their feedback, we can feel pretty comfortable deploying that into production around the November timeframe to begin onboarding the first Uniswap LP tokens. However, with the caveat, we should probably have the debt ceilings quite conservative at first as we undergo audits simultaneously. As many of you might know, the audit process can be quite time-consuming, not in the sense that the audit itself takes very long but that the waitlist for auditors can be quite large, so we can\u2019t promise that the audit will come back quickly. We can\u2019t jack up the debt ceilings on these things, but I think, at the very least, we can start incorporating them into the protocol and setting us up for that down the road.   In terms of BAL pool tokens, we haven\u2019t started the oracle for that. Still, it likely will follow the same design pattern that we used for the Uniswap oracle with the caveat that BAL pools have more dynamic allocation of assets between them instead of just the standard 50/50. But that seems more like a bolt-on type of thing than anything that fundamentally changes the larger design. So, that\u2019s it for me, does anyone have any questions?   LongForWisdom: There will be protocol whitelisting stuff next week as well?  Nik Kunkel: Yeah, so I submitted the polling votes for those, so B protocol wants to get whitelisted for the ETH-USD oracles with both the medianizer and the oracle security module. I\u2019ve checked out the code; it looks clean. It seems like it\u2019s handling the data safely so that those polling votes will go out next Monday.      Charles St. Louis MIPs Update 23:08 1262\u00d7692 305 KB 1214\u00d7696 379 KB 1196\u00d7694 241 KB 1244\u00d7698 353 KB 1204\u00d7680 284 KB 1212\u00d7686 298 KB   It should be noted that the proposals that have entered the RFC phase are the same as last week:   MIP17, which is a rewrite of the original one that was looking at DC adjustments as well as RP adjustments. However, this one is now proposed by PlanetX, and it\u2019s only for the weekly actual DC adjustments. I highly recommend checking that out, looking at the logic, and seeing if people agree is how we should move forward.   MIP24 is an emergency response system proposed by John Athman, which was proposed a couple of weeks ago, but it should be eligible for November.   We have the MIP25 Flash Mint Module by Sam, and that was a follow-up to the declarations of intent for creating a flash module for Maker. This is the technical implementation of that intent.   Next, we have the MIP26, which is the Governance contract redesign, called DSS-Gov. It includes a vote delegation functionality.   Then, there is the MIP 27 Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module, which you can think of as an automated version of MIP17, although there are some differences. So if you\u2019re looking at MIP27, then you should look at MIP17 to compare and see if the manual processes transfer over to the automatic one.   Lastly, as Amy mentioned, there\u2019s MIP28, which is the operational support domain definitions, ultimately defining the entire support domain and if it were to be approved, what the actions the domain would take in helping facilitate and running the DAO.     In terms of sub-proposals, we had a source cred funding proposal.   We had another sub-proposal as a follow-up to MIP28 to onboard Amy as a support facilitator.   Lastly, there is the sub-proposal for Calendar exceptions, which is an amendment to potentially skip, for lack of a better term, the December governance cycle.   Lastly, there are still two pretty active new proposal ideas discussed in the forums for my update. The first one is the flapper distributor. This is a way to distribute system surplus while minimizing governance processes and the proposal idea for replacing the mechanism to burn MKR with the treasury, which has had some good discussions and debates in there.   If anyone has any questions about what\u2019s happening next in polls or votes, feel free to ask in the forums or during this call before LongForWisdom begins the governance review.   Discussion 29:00   LongForWisdom: Thank you, Charles. I trust that if anyone has thoughts or comments on the inclusion polls, I know some of them are quite close, like the MIP21. Does anyone have any thoughts on that or the others that they want to share? Lev, did you want to share anything, or are you good?   Lev: I just wanted to say that there was also a poll about a different approach to rate setting. If it were able to be used, that would have to be holistically considered together with the rate-setting thing, so I guess at some point there ought to be a discussion about when, if ever, which would fit into the rates working groups deliberations.   LongForWisdom: Just reiterate that in case anyone missed it. Lev said that the MIP20 brings in the lever to operate on negative rates essentially. It\u2019s not clear how that would interact with the rate-setting working group was voted through as well, which is fair. I think we\u2019ll have to figure that out if it comes up. Anyone else?   Lev: It\u2019s probably worth adding that it was implicit considering the latest discussion around MIP20. Many people are speaking in support of it, including myself. However, we weren\u2019t proposing that MIP20 is something that will necessarily be used immediately or that there was an imperative to turn it on in the short term. I\u2019m wondering if anyone believes that it should be used in the near future or if nobody wants to use it right now?   LongForWisdom: I\u2019m not 100% sure, but does anybody want to chime in? Activating would be a whole new discussion. We\u2019d have to make a poll to discuss this in more detail.     Frank Cruz: What\u2019s the next step for RWA to be going to the executive? Is it another greenlight poll?   Charles: We just completed the inclusion polls. Now is the opportunity for them to move forward to be rejected. When the inclusion polls have successfully passed, they will be bundled up in a governance poll for the MKR community to vote on. If that passes, it will go onto the executive vote.   Frank Cruz: Okay, it\u2019s a bundle. Yes, I get it. Centrifuge and Matt can begin working on getting it ready?   LongForWisdom: It\u2019s not fully signed off. It won\u2019t be until the executive passes. But this is a positive sign for both of them. However, the bundle still can fail.   Frank Cruz: There are another sixty days to have at least one RWA with a debt ceiling?   Charles: I wouldn\u2019t speculate on a timeline. The team should speak on their timeline and proposals.   Lucas: We have been pushing it with full force. We are working with the risk team to develop and understand what the sensible parameters are. I don\u2019t want to commit to a timeline. We need to go through the executive vote, the forum based poll, and the inclusion poll. We need to go through the same process as other collateral types.   Chris Mooney: This is a slight bit different than normal collaterals in that real-world assets are going to require some reasonable expense on behalf of Lucas and Matt in the real world to sort of set up whatever legal structures they have. Imagine we get all this to the executive. These guys spend a few hundred thousand dollars trying to get legal stuff in order; there are many risks for them if we don\u2019t approve that executive. I\u2019m just flagging this for the future. Maybe we want to think about getting the code totally ironed out and approved in an executive with a zero debt ceiling because then it\u2019s pretty much guaranteed that all you\u2019d have to do is set up the parameter. That way, they would take a lot less risk with real-world expenses. Maybe Lucas or Matt want to speak on that. But I\u2019m just flagging that it\u2019s slightly different from adding collateral that\u2019s already on Ethereum.   Matthew Rabinowitz: That\u2019s exactly the way I contemplate what you just said, Chris, it\u2019s precisely that. Without being presumptuous, assuming everything goes well the remainder of this month. The executive implemented is kind of at our discretion. In contrast, putting together trust and trust counsel and all sorts of enforceability opinions would be contemplated that there would be an approved debt ceiling. Still, it would be conditionally set at zero, which will take up until the point where I can prove or demonstrate to the community that I implemented what I said I would implement. We\u2019ll put together; I wouldn\u2019t call it a cheat sheet, but basically a cheat sheet of all the terms to go look at \u201cdocument A page 37,\u201d etc. That basically would be my hopes or expectation that as soon as we have that after that, the executive could follow what would allow it to be in effect turned on.     Lucas: From a technical point of view, though, it\u2019s precisely the same, right? Because the only way the debt ceiling could then be raised would still be with an executive vote. The question is, and there are two options we can of getting the technical side through. If that part is actually ready before the legal setup is ready, it makes sense. Still, if we are in a place where we have the legal setup ready at the same time, then we could also just opt to sort of start with the non-zero debt ceiling? Still, I do agree it could make a lot of sense to get the technology and get the tech in place knowing full well though that we need the same kind of votes and the same kind of governance process for both instances.   Chris: I guess you\u2019re right; you have the same risk. Even if we deploy all the code and ready with a zero debt ceiling, Governance could still choose not to vote that final executive, which is still a risk.   Matthew Rabinowitz: It is a risk but respectfully, if we\u2019ve gone through the executive and we implement what we said we were going to do, not implementing the final executive could almost be construed as a governance attack some point.   Lucas Vogelsang: It\u2019s at least a breakdown of the process. Like we do have all these many steps before reaching consensus as a community, I mean, as long as people are allowed to vote on the final referendum, I look at it as Democracy. You have the community\u2019s final vote, but yeah, it would be a bit of a breakdown of the process, I think if we ended up being in that situation.   LongForWisdom: Yes, it would not be good, and if it were to happen, we would have to dig into that situation and figure out why. Unless there was an apparent reason, we\u2019d probably end up voting again and assume it was some kind of fluke if we didn\u2019t have any feedback from the people that voted against.     Lucas Vogelsang: I have a question for you, Charles, because you said the initial executive passing from Matt\u2019s proposal sets a debt ceiling to zero, and a follow-up executive vote is required using the weekly cycle. Here, the assumption is that the technical changes go through this normal prolonged process of a new MIP. Then, the follow-up set activating it or putting it to something greater than zero is going through a shorter cycle. Is that correct?  Charles St-Louis: Yes, if I am correct and just to your point earlier about when your proposal is passed for the liquidation system for the Centrifuge based assets, so if that passes, the actual onboarding of those assets will not go through the monthly cycle. They\u2019ll follow the newly approved collateral onboarding cycle, a weekly process that only requires a governance poll to gauge sentiment. If it passes, it can move on to an executive, which can happen within 30 days unless there are certain exceptions or unique cases. As you mentioned earlier, we wouldn\u2019t have to go through the governance inclusion and monthly executive process. It would be the weekly process for those assets once they\u2019re prioritized, of course.    Brianmcmichael: It sounds like these are two distinct votes; There\u2019s the vote to prove the technical decision, but then the second vote is just to raise the fee or the cap, but it\u2019s also the Governance\u2019s chance to evaluate the legal documentation and ensure that those are up to snuff, right? So there\u2019s a little more to it socially than just the debt ceiling limit increase?  LongForWisdom: Yeah, I think that\u2019s true. So the way I picture this happening, assuming all these MIPs go through the monthly cycle, is layout the intention that Governance has agreed to do. They also lay out the technical parts, so what we would have then is, you know, once Matt and Lucas come back with the legal stuff that we\u2019re waiting on, then that\u2019ll be posted in the forum. The domain teams will also do their evaluations of the assets and set up all the stuff they need. Then we\u2019ll have the governance poll for onboarding it with certain parameters, which might be zero to start with. That will link to all those various threads, the evaluations, and the legal docs and stuff. So I think it\u2019ll be four votes that still need to pass. I\u2019m not trying to count them. It would be like the MIPs, the Governance, this monthly government\u2019s bundle, the monthly governance executive, the weekly poll to confirm initial parameters, and then the executive to actually put the code in and deploy these parameters.    Lucas Vogelsang: So, what does this mean? Coming back to Frank\u2019s question, how long will it take with the four votes?   LongForWisdom: So, the first two are part of this monthly cycle. They\u2019ll be finished by the end of October, and then the two votes after that; the weekly cycle poll and the weekly executive will happen at some week in the future, possibly in different weeks depending on how long or depending on how busy the smart contracts team is but that can be whenever we have all the information we need. That\u2019s somewhat dependent on you guys and somewhat dependent on the domain teams to do the evaluations.   Chris: So, in a perfect world, it could be in the first week of November, but ultimately it comes down to job priority right now.     Procedural LongForWisdom October MIPs Inclusion Review 52:22  LongForWisdom: I forgot to do the MIPs inclusion review, so I\u2019ll just do it now. All the inclusion polls that have passed will be included in the bundle poll next week. I don\u2019t see any reason, why not. They all passed the inclusion, so there\u2019s no reason to exclude any of them. They will all continue.  ",

The more significant thing to note is that lighter volumes for DAI<>ETH pairs and DAI<>USDC have been around 1.08 or 1.09. We\u2019ve seen a couple spikes from Uniswap trades with some degree of slippage.    1444\u00d7534 188 KB   ETH price during that time frame has been slightly rising.

At the end of the day, we\u2019ve had this wall at around 200-250% collateralized.   Simply through price raise, collateral management has been better. Less motion because of ETH price.    Open Discussion 53:21   Frank Cruz: This might be a bit too early, but I was wondering with regards to yesterday\u2019s discussion of liquidation 2.0 if we\u2019ve set up a short meeting with the Gauntlet about what precisely the parameters are that we will be testing and things of that nature. Yeah, maybe it\u2019s a little too early, right?   Chris Mooney: So we have a regularly scheduled thing with them at this point. Last I checked, they were attempting to get the deploys ready, so we are trying to unblock them on deploying liquidation 2.0 into their kit. They have to kind of mock-up this whole deploy thing, so they\u2019re not quite there yet. They\u2019re trying to build their infrastructure out using liquidations 2.0 right now.   Frank Cruz: So you think having them come on would be a good idea, or it\u2019s too early?   Chris Mooney: I\u2019d say probably too early right this moment. Maybe in another couple of weeks. I\u2019ll bring it up in the next call we have with them.   Frank Cruz: Cool. And I think Lix had drawn up a nice little graph. Do you think the community members should come up with scenarios where there might be an attack or if liquidations 2.0 might have some issues, etc.?   Chris Mooney: Yeah, to that end on the call yesterday, I had kind of said, you know, this is the time if anyone can think of how they might want to exploit liquidations 2.0, how they would use it to turn a profit, you know, whatever types of exploits they can come up with. I mean, put your black hats on and think about liquidations 2.0 because we need to fix any of these types of attack vectors or add something that would make a risk that we didn\u2019t see yet. You can post in the forums or just message us directly.   Frank Cruz: Thanks a lot, Mooney.     LongForWisdom: I actually have a follow-up question regarding the gauntlet stuff. Will they be testing various price curves for the auctions? Is that part of what they\u2019re going to be testing?   Chris Mooney: I believe we discussed that they would even possibly suggest the ideal sort of parameters in some cases, so I\u2019m expecting that\u2019s sort of the data set that they give us and also if you weren\u2019t in the call yesterday, we were also kind of hoping, you know, this is more of like software as a service with them, but we were hoping that this entire kit would be available to Maker off into the future so we would be able to maybe once a week or whenever run a simulation on all of our assets and see what types of things that that scenario would have suggested for risk parameters. So we could see things change over time, right? That\u2019s probably in the meeting.   LongForWisdom: Yeah, that sounds great. That would be very useful, I\u2019m sure. I imagine risk would appreciate having more tools like that.     LongForWisdom: Maybe talk briefly about the potential surplus buffer increases because I know there was a signal a couple of weeks ago from Aaron that was sort of inconclusive. The more recent one by Primoz has been a little bit more positive. Does anyone have any thoughts on increasing the buffer, keeping the buffer the same, or anything like that?  LongForWisdom: Okay, I guess that\u2019s not a terribly interesting topic today. I would say that the most compelling point is that the total DAI supply has increased by a reasonable amount. The surplus buffer hasn\u2019t increased to match that, so it would make sense to increase it in terms of just keeping risk about the same.    Primoz Kordez: I think the other question about the surplus buffer is what do we do after five weeks? Should we keep increasing it until we reach a 100% collateralization ratio? What\u2019s the general strategy with the crude fees on stable coins? There was some question on forums: is there a strategy to lower stability fees on those stable coin vaults? This means that the collateralization ratio will drop slower, and thereby if DAI price falls, you will see self-unwinding, which is positive because you wouldn\u2019t really need to liquidate them and all the unknowns related to it. On the other hand, if we make these fees really low, we have this self-unwinding, it will take more time to reach DAI parity because when the DAI price is falling when you have this self-unwinding, everybody who\u2019s self-unwinding is buying DAI, right? So the Dai price will fall over as well, but you will faster decrease the stablecoin exposure on the positive side. So my answer was that actually, Governance needs to decide what\u2019s the priority here. Do we want to decrease stablecoin exposure as fast as possible, but then the DAI price will just fall slower. That means that we\u2019ll have lower fees on stablecoins, possibly going lower than 4%. Or because we can have this extreme scenario where you could just increase stablecoin fees, let\u2019s say to 50%. You would decrease the collateralization ratio to 100% in about less than a week. Then, basically, until the DAI parity is reached, you wouldn\u2019t see any stablecoin unwinding. So the DAI parity could be reached quickly if you, of course, have the scenario of lower demand and higher supply. The stablecoin will still stay in the portfolio until that point. So basically, it\u2019s up to the Governance how long do they want to tolerate these stablecoins. I know that the only way out is to increase the DAI supply or hope that the DAI demand falls. Other than that, we still have some tools to manage the pace of unwinding.  LongForWisdom: Yeah, that was an interesting point. I pretty much didn\u2019t consider that it would speed up unwinding, or like the speed of the exposure or that decreasing would increase. That did make a lot of sense. Cool, all right, it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone\u2019s waiting to dive in and discuss something, so we can probably finish the call a little early this week.    David Utrobin: There\u2019s one thing I would love to mention, actually. In line with what Primoz was saying, there is also another tactic. All of the vaults in USDC-A, obviously some of them will reach 100% quicker than others. Still, I think there was discussion both in the forums and at the end of last week\u2019s governance call concerning the idea of zeroing out the debt ceiling on USDC-A and then separately monitoring those vaults and opening up a USDC-C facility with the same parameters as USDC-A. What that would do is basically help us divide up the positions and not have to worry about some amount of them and still basically allow that arbitrage of the DAI Peg down to whatever, a dollar and a penny, because of that 101% CR. Nevertheless, then it would give us far more control over the USDC-A positions. So if anybody has any thoughts or comments on that, I\u2019d love to hear them.   LongForWisdom: I think there have been a couple of things proposed at this point, maybe three or four different strategies we could take. I believe that one would probably be good, so I think we will end up in the same situation with the USD-C vaults, so I don\u2019t think the full that\u2019s used immediately I think it would still be spread over a few weeks or a month or two months or something. I think we still see some vaults in USDC, which had lower ratios than others.   Gregory Di Prisco: There is a chat in Governance and risk where Sam and myself were talking. You can save a little bit of efficiency on the auctions by trying to stop them around 100, but it\u2019s really, in my opinion, really minor compared to the amount of mental overhead we\u2019ll have to do to achieve it. I can see the argument for either direction, but personally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s essential. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s not an emergency thing where we need to do this. We can take a couple of weeks, analyze the quantifiable efficiency gains, and then decide on that.   SamM: Yeah, I\u2019m definitely in the other camp on that. Even if we have like 0.1% or 0.01% auction inefficiency, it may end up costing us potentially tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, in the end, to run it below 100%.   Gregory Di Prisco: Yeah, that could be right. I think we should try and put a model together. I can help with that, too.   Matthew Rabinowitz: And that\u2019s if you do auctions, right? At the same time, the real objective is to drive down the DAI price and have people close out their own positions. And then we don\u2019t have any loss, no?   SamM: Yeah, exactly, that is the ideal scenario: closing out their own positions.   LongForWisdom: Yeah, so obviously, the lower the positions go under, like 100% collateralization, the lower the DAI price has to go for people to close out. I think that\u2019s how it works, right?   David Utrobin: Yeah, that\u2019s right.   Primoz Kordez: That is why it makes sense to lower stability fees on stablecoins if you want to have a higher possibility of self-unwinding. But then, as I said, on the other hand, you might not be maximizing the fee collection, and it will take longer for the high price to fall. As I said, you will have the self-unwinding happening quicker, which is a positive. It is tough to say, right? Is it 2% or 4%? How can you really time the DAI price decrease with the fees accrued to make it really perfect? It\u2019s pretty much impossible because of the DAI price decrease; you know, there are many variables included to estimate when we can see supply. We could control supply to some extent or hope to onboard cool assets, but there\u2019s a demand side.     Matthew Rabinowitz: Sorry, and I do have one question related to that: so if we ultimately one day went through and did this manually, at some point, I agree with Greg that the mental cognitive overhead right now is probably not worth it; maybe it might be in a couple of weeks, a month or two or six. But wouldn\u2019t there still be a 13% liquidation penalty for those parties?   Gregory Di Prisco: No.   Matthew Rabinowitz: Why not? Why wouldn\u2019t we?   David Utrobin: Well, I believe the auctions would try to recover 13% on whatever the debt is, but it\u2019s just not going to get it.   Kurt: David said it correctly. The keepers won\u2019t bid more than the collateral\u2019s fair market value, and there\u2019s no way to force them to do that. They will sit there hoping to get 13%, but they just wouldn\u2019t get it. We\u2019ll get approximately the value of the collateral minus some inefficiency factor.   Matthew Rabinowitz: Understood, now I\u2019m not entirely familiar with how the keeper side of it works. I didn\u2019t know there was a 13% ding in effect on the principal at that stage.   MakerMan: Hey, can I chime in a little bit? So the only buffer for any kind of anything is that 1% there. That\u2019s it, there is no 13%. The second thing is that the interest rate is running into the surplus buffer, right? So you can kind of run the numbers, but you\u2019ve got to run them against what\u2019s already gone into the surplus buffer. So the clock is kind of ticking on several things. I don\u2019t consider this an emergency. I hear many people saying, well, if we can get the DAI price down somehow, get people to close, that that\u2019s kind of an ideal situation, but we\u2019ve been in this boat for a while, and I don\u2019t easily see us getting out of it. There\u2019s no 13% anywhere. We\u2019ve got 1% to work, and that clock has been ticking into that 1% for a while now.   Matthew Rabinowitz: Understood, got it.   David Utrobin: And that\u2019s why it\u2019s probably not a bad idea to advocate for lowering the stability fee on USDC-A to extend that clock a little bit for Governance. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m missing something that might make that a bad idea.   SamM: Yeah, I\u2019m definitely in favor of lowering the stability fee at some point.   David Utrobin: Especially since we\u2019re maxed out on the surplus buffer right now, and we\u2019re doing the surplus auctions, it might be responsible to lower the stability fees on USDC-A.   MakerMan: I mean, loosely speaking, some of that DAI that we thought we had that we are now buying MKR with we kind of don\u2019t have. You kind of really want to pull that back until you solve this problem.   Gregory Di Prisco: Well, that\u2019s not true. We have the DAI that we burned so far. It\u2019ll become a problem in a couple of months, but the DAI getting burned now is definitely ours to keep.   Matthew Rabinowitz: I do, however, want to caution or recommend, at least to the community, the notion that we\u2019re changing the stability fee on anything less than the underlying risk that\u2019s associated with the collateral. I think it sets a dangerous precedent from my perspective only to move the stability fee, in effect trying to mix monetary policy with risk policy.   MakerMan: There was one thought I had on this USDC-C because the one thing about opening that up, and I don\u2019t want to get into the details of, is that in effect that will reset the clock. Anything that goes in there, whatever the stability fee is, that clock starts when that facility opens.   David Utrobin: Yeah, absolutely. My whole point about the USDC-C thing is that you get to, basically, have more control over those positions where you don\u2019t have to manually liquidate. Still, you have more control since you can set the stability beyond each of those facilities as you need.     Longforwisdom: I think there are some costs to adding new vault types. Obviously, the smart contracts team has to do deployments and things, right, and Governance has to vote on these things each time. So there are other costs as well. It\u2019s a quarter past the hour, so it\u2019s time to think of wrapping up. Any final points that anyone wants to make? Anything that anyone wants to point out?   Primoz Kordez: Yes, actually just one, I think. We need to have ETH-B vaults go live so that the debt ceiling is 20 million. I mentioned that we made the analysis. Actually, Lix made a really nice tool to measure how much of the vaults use DAI to farm on ETH vaults. One-third of that we can directly link to debt with DAI being farmed mostly on Compound and, particularly on Uniswap, a smaller part on Curve. I was thinking, if ETH-A vaults migrate to ETH-B, then their yield is boosted by 15-16%. The rate is not going to be as high. There\u2019s still going to be a positive outcome, so I am thinking that if those ETH farmers are rational, we should see a quick utilization of ETH-B vaults 20 million. Then I guess we\u2019ll need to decide how to go forward because, as I said, in theory, all the hundreds of millions of those vaults could migrate to ETH-B. We will need to decide our risk tolerance because we know there are some risks there and so on. This is just something to watch out for this weekend.   MakerMan: In general, I like that idea. I\u2019ve kind of been an advocate of multiple vaults on the same collateral type with different parameters because you can use those with how the markets react and use them to give you a better gauge as to what the markets like either in terms of rate or liquidation ratio or whatever. They are a helpful tool even though inherently managing them will be much more complicated, which I agree with right out of the gate.     LongForWisdom: Thank you for that very much, MakerMan. I agree that it will be interesting to see what happens after that goes live. I think we\u2019ve come to the end of our time, so I guess we\u2019ll all go our separate ways.

We\u2019re posting a high-level overview of the Governance and Risk call ahead of the high fidelity call summary very week. Team Updates Smart Contracts with @cmooney   No executive spell last week! No parameters changed. PAXG assessment was published in July  by @befitsandpiper  ETH-B collateral type deployed on Kovan, working on getting it to Mainnet  Liquidations 2.0 discussion call took place yesterday, Smart Contracts team is working to get the code complete. BAL, YFI, possibly PAXG will be going on Kovan next week.  Oracles with @NikKunkel   Performed BAL and YFI oracle assessments, will be releasing into production next week. Team is on track to get onboarding done for an executive at the end of the month. Working on UNI LP token oracle and potentially deploying into production in November with conservative debt ceiling. Plan to model Balancer oracle after UNI one.  Risk with @Primoz   GUSD and PAXG evaluations are getting finalized. The risk domain team is focusing on new assets with the prioritization framework, with UNI and REN ranking the highest. The team started assigning those evaluations. Collateral evaluation template is getting finalized and will hopefully attract more analysts.  Increasing Surplus Buffer discussion is still going on.  Operations and Community Development with @amyjung   Announced fellowship between Kleros and Maker:   Kleros is a decentralized decision making protocol. A key use case of Kleros is to act as a decentralized verification (or vetting) mechanism for the compliance of crypto assets with required conditions. This framework should address features such as code, risk profile and legal compliance. Applications close in two weeks.   Development Grants platform will be launching soon. Watch the demo day from community-development!  Collateral Onboarding with @juan   Will publish collateral prioritization ranking framework next week. Ren and Uniswap collateral call recap video from yesterday. Next call is October 21 at 17:00 UTC with EURStasis and Crypto.com  Collateral calls | G&R | Liquidations 2.0 calls are all published on YouTube the same day.   MIPs with @charlesstlouis   All 8 inclusion polls passed today! They will be bundled into the Monthly MIPs Governance Poll and go up for vote Monday, Oct 19.  BAL and YFI collateral types passed by going through the new weekly cycle.  October Greenlight polls will go up Monday Oct 19 and run for two weeks. Check what collateral types will be included in the vote in the Collateral Status Index.  There are 9 proposals currently in the RFC phase  There are two active Pre-MIP discussions: FlapperDistributor and Replacing Mechanism to Burn MKR with a Treasury.   Other Presentations and Updates  Different approach to rate setting MIP20 passed and there was a brief discussion around when to use par, that would come up in the coming weeks. Vox isn\u2019t turned on by default, it\u2019s up to Governance to determine when and how to use it.  Governance at a Glance   Wanted: Governance Help  - @LongForWisdom is still searching for people interesting in taking a larger role in governance with the end goal of finding additional governance facilitators.  Peg  The DAI price stays steady at an average of $1.01 but dipping closer down to peg over the past week. The DAI supply rises to around 910 million. An ETH-B Vault Type will be added in the executive on Friday with a lower liquidation ratio.  ",

Hi @juan, I recently joined the community and stumbled upon this while looking for ways I might be able to contribute. I\u2019ve developed assessment/prioritization frameworks in the past in my corporate consulting work and would be happy to share my thoughts here if they\u2019re welcome. I recently made a high-level structure assessing and prioritizing new token and new blockchain integrations for the multichain discussions at Ren Project here. If we wanted to apply it to Maker, we\u2019d obviously need to adapt the structure to consider the LTV risks resulting from price volatility. I had also considered adding a scoring rubric to give quantitative scores for qualitative benefits/risks. Let me know if any of this sounds interesting to you, and perhaps, we can discuss!  ",

Today is Thursday, September 3rd at 16:00 UTC. My name is LongForWisdom. I am the current MakerDAO Governance Facilitator. I am joined by a bunch of people both within Maker and without. I will briefly review the agenda. Anybody is free to interrupt and ask questions during any point of this call.   There is a quick request by JoeQ reminding everybody to run auction keepers. If you have friends who may not be running auction keepers, try to get them to run auction keepers. Auction keepers are important and as we scale Dai it\u2019s important to try to scale the number of keepers as well.   Discussions happen in the Forum.   Forum Recap Domain Team Updates Wil Barnes Smart Contracts Team Update 02:00   We deployed PAXUSD and Tether to Kovan this morning, and right now, we are working on the spell to deploy the main net, which will go live tomorrow.   Mostly this week and last week, with liquidations 1.2 just behind this, it\u2019s been continuing efforts on liquidations 2.0, with more concrete plans in the coming weeks.   The spell from yesterday, increasing ETH debt ceiling to 540 million, was executed about seven hours ago this morning on September 3rd. So the ETH debt ceiling is now 540 million, and the global debt ceiling is secured at 708 million. Those are the highlights right now.   LongForWisdom: To elaborate briefly on the Executive yesterday, which was triggered by the risk domain team due to the high uptake on the yETH Vault that was released recently.   Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 03:25   Last week, we had fast-tracked the yEarn vote because we were concerned about the peg state and saw a lot of potential in the yETH Vault type in helping us bring the peg down. So far, from what we\u2019ve seen, that does seem to be the case. It\u2019s quite astounding how quickly they\u2019ve been able to stockpile ETH into that Vault. It looks like we will be able to leverage a lot of growth out of that. Ultimately, I think that that was the right call.   Looking forward, this Friday, Argent, and MyCrypto have finished setting up their light feeds. So, we will include their Keys, which they\u2019ve posted in the forum, and signed a message with. We\u2019ll be adding their keys as light feeds for the oracles in the Executive this coming Friday.   Then, tBTC is about to relaunch their new version, so they had to deploy new contracts. We need to do a polling vote to swap their oracle whitelisting from the previous address they were using, on version one, to address their new version two deployment.   Cyrus Younessi Risk Team Update 05:40   We will be releasing a COMP evaluation in a few days. We had our independent risk grantee submit a ChainLink evaluation to us last week, and we\u2019re going through that and reviewing the work and vetting it. That should also get released sometime later this week or early next week, probably, but I\u2019m hoping in time for the governance cycle.   We evaluated the c-tokens, which is going to be published soon. We are not recommending those; we are not submitting an application for collateral evaluation there, we\u2019ll leave that up for the Community if there\u2019s interest. But we analyzed it, and they\u2019re  undoubtedly interesting candidates. Much of that analysis can be used for other similar assets like yCRV or whatever else comes down that path, so I\u2019m excited to share that.   Also, Loopring will get resubmitted as well, but it\u2019s going to be the same evaluation as last time.   Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think PAXG is going to make it into this cycle. We just ran out of time with all this stuff going on in the ecosystem right now on top of the risk transition. We couldn\u2019t get to that one for this cycle, but we will for sure next month.   Primoz is going to give a presentation on the ETH-A risk premium, which we spent a lot of time on.   Collateral Calls Juan Guill\u00e9n 08:15   My name is Juan, and with the help of Lea and Lucas from Centrifuge, we have been organizing these collateral calls, where different projects present for ten minutes. Then we have a discussion for 20 minutes open to everyone to ask questions and discuss the different collateral types.   So far, we\u2019ve had New Silver and Matthew Rabinowitz from 6s Capital and then ShuttleOne and ArCoin.   This coming Wednesday, September 9th at 5 PM UTC, we\u2019re going to have Rafael Cosman from TrustTokens, who\u2019s going to discuss TUSD, TCAD, TAUD, and TGBP, and we\u2019ll also have 1inch that\u2019s going to be talking about Mooniswap.   So, September 9th at 5 PM UTC I\u2019m going to post the link to the agenda in the forum. Then two weeks later, we\u2019re going to have Stani from Aave discussing their token and Tyler Winklevoss from Gemini discussing GUSD.   If you would like to discuss a project, I\u2019m also going to post in the chat the forum to show your interest, and we can schedule the call for that.   LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 09:47   Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread: If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated.  Discussions   SourceCred Pilot Extension  LongForWisdom shares that the SourceCred pilot is being extended for another three months. After those three months elapse, and pending governance approval, we\u2019ll attempt to fund the initiative from the Maker Protocol.    Different Approach to Rate Setting   Primoz describes an approach to rate-setting based on the market rates available elsewhere that may be more sustainable for the Protocol in the longer term.   Primoz Kordez: I was thinking about how we are rating the rates currently. Maybe some things are not really in line, and so I have this different proposal that says that currently when we\u2019re setting rates to a hostage of Dai back, you know if we raise rates, we might endanger the whole situation with the price. But if we can save that thing for an instant, with just one of our tools, such as a lower liquidation ratio for USDC, we can manage the rates with more flexibility. In a sense, that way, we rely more on setting the rates properly, so we compensate the risk and position ourselves better in the DeFi whole ecosystem. That\u2019s particularly important now when we have seen most of the Dai minting done by farmers. Probably, raising rates wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean that there will be many unwindings and endanger the peg. I am not even sure if we need that tool to protect the peg. We should be prepared for that, but it is just a different strategy as we advance. It\u2019s something we haven\u2019t discussed and has some business logic to it, but it\u2019s something we haven\u2019t focused on. There are other things as well, but perhaps we can have this discussion next time, so we don\u2019t take too much time.   LongForWisdom: If this sounds interesting to any of you either positively or negatively, please, read over the threads and comment on your thoughts. This represents a direction in terms of rate-setting, so it would be good to get as much input as possible.   LongForWisdom: The other main thing that I want to mention, which is not a discussion but just the source cred pilots that most of you are aware exist, has been extended for another three months. There\u2019s a link in Governance at a Glance to see the details. Currently, the plan is that after those two months elapse, we will put the proposal to Governance that the Protocol will fund the source credit rewards going forward. There will be more coming out as we get toward the end of these few months. If anybody wants to read the plans, it\u2019s available in the link.       Signal Requests   Adjust the BAT Debt Ceiling  befitsandpiper asks if we should increase the BAT-A debt ceiling as it\u2019s currently at 100% utilization.    Add a DC Trigger for planned raises   Aaron_Bartsch proposes that we add a trigger point at which on-chain polls for debt ceiling raises should happen without the need for a quorum   LongForWisdom: It\u2019s asking if once we get to 90% utilization that we should automatically put a poll on chain instead of requiring a signal request.     Limit Vaults to a maximum % of global DAI supply   Aaron_Bartsch asks if we should limit the debt ceiling on vaults to a maximum percentage of the global DAI supply.   LongForWisdom: The intention is to keep the previous proposal in line in case things get crazy.     Quantitative easing to fix the peg (aka Manual PSM)   SebVentures asks if we should pursue a quantitative easing plan using USDC and a new vault type limited to use by the Protocol.   LongForWisdom: He\u2019s asking if we should set up a USDC vault with a 100% liquidation ratio, which is limited to use by the Protocol for forcibly halving the Dai peg or shorting the Dai peg.     Should we reduce the USDC-A collateralization ratio?   Aaron_Bartsch asks if we should decrease the USDC-A collateralization ratio to promote peg stability.   LongForWisdom: I suppose this is prompted by his signal request post mentioned above.     Increase WBTC Debt Ceiling   Aaron_Bartsch proposes increasing the wBTC debt ceiling again to accommodate the increased usage.   LongForWisdom: Starting Monday and finishing just before this call, I suspect it has passed.     Reddit Moderator for r/MakerDAO  LongForWisdom: David Utrobin recently posted a Help Wanted thread searching for a Reddit moderator for MakerDAO. I think we currently have one candidate, but it will be useful to get two or three more to get things moving and looking nice. If you are interested in that, please, leave a message in the thread.    MIPs Charles St. Louis Weekly MIPs Update 16:05 1435\u00d7785 149 KB  This week\u2019s activity as mentioned last week was a gap week between August and September\u2019s governance cycles.  1433\u00d7796 198 KB  After the formal submission period, myself as the MIP editor will make the respective changes in the GitHub to make sure that it reflects those changes.  1429\u00d7789 138 KB 1429\u00d7792 148 KB  I wanted to share some collateral onboarding stats to show everyone how far we\u2019ve gotten over the last few months.  1429\u00d7788 145 KB  I\u2019ve added this bit to reiterate on the updates from before although the domain teams have already covered it.  1424\u00d7788 117 KB   We have a couple of new proposals over this last week, which is exciting. These two are both technical MIPs. I will add the links for MIP21 and MIP22. Please, take a read. If they are formally submitted, they can potentially make it before the end of the October\u2019s cycle but that is completely up to the authors, of course.   I don\u2019t have a summary for the subproposal but if Matt was on the call with us, he would give it. I suggest giving the subproposal a read because it is very exciting.   1423\u00d7777 248 KB   As usual, there are the typical candidates that are still in the RFC phase. I just wanted to provide updates on when they are available to be formally submitted by the author.   If anybody wants to get involved with MIP17 and push it forward, please, message me.   1427\u00d7787 132 KB   The Vault Liquidation Mechanism for Centrifuge Trade Finance Assets was a precursor to the actual MIP22 posted by Centrifuge.   The Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module related to MIP17\u2019s concept of having adjustments for the debt ceiling but in a more automatic fashion controlled by governance with less governance friction.   The first bullet under active discussions is an accidental duplicate.   I will post my follow-up thread on the forum as usual if anybody wants to see it as opposed to hear it.   Other Presentations and Updates Primoz Kordez Setting the ETH-A Risk Premium 24:13 1421\u00d7784 59.9 KB  Today, we are presenting much anticipated calculations on ETH-A risk premium. Spoiler alert, there won\u2019t be one specific pin-pointed number from our side but there is going to be a range provided. I will explain how this makes sense from our side.  1428\u00d7793 68.2 KB   We are using a model showcased earlier from this year. This model uses GBM and it uses jump risks. It simulated ten thousand of paths. We are interested in getting the distribution of losses from which we can then get a risk premium or so-called average loss.   We outlined three scenarios where each one uses different inputs called variable inputs for calculating outputs. These three are the most important when it comes to such modeling.   The Auction slippage curve tells us when keepers come to auctions to bid. They normally bid below 100% because there are certain slippages used which I will explain later.   The Collateralization Ratio Distribution tells us what amount of debt lies below certain collateralization ratio.   The Jump risk is something that we apply on top of the GBM model to model the crashes of Ether price for instance with what happened on Black Thursday.   1428\u00d7791 61 KB   We keep this input fixed for Ether.   The most important is the standard volatility. This is just from historical data.   The liquidation penalty is fixed.   Another thing that is important but outdated is the debt ceiling. I was making calculations a few days ago before we knew why it worked. This debt ceiling was the old nominal number and therefore the outputs maybe a little outdated but in some sense I think they aren\u2019t necessarily outdated. I will try to explain that at the end.   1429\u00d7789 133 KB   This is how we modeled the auction slippage curve. It uses its own model, which I won\u2019t go into much detail here because that will require another call.   Basically, we are using different inputs to model auction slippage for an upside case.   Collateral slippage is when people acquire ether from the auction they need to flip it on exchanges and they won\u2019t be able to sell it at market price if they acquired a lot of ETH.   Keeper target profit is something that keepers just do.   Dai slippage is when keepers don\u2019t hold Dai and instead might buy it. If there\u2019s a shallow liquidity, it might cause lower bids from their side. Luckily, we have a lot of liquidity now in curves, so this is not as constraining anymore.   For the keeper capital we just used some numbers for the upside case and downside case. Keeper capital is important as well because if keepers wouldn\u2019t have enough capital, we would then be hoping that there is enough liquidity from outsiders that are able to bid on these auctions, which might be infrastructure-wise not fit for everyone.   The bid discount is just an input if keepers need to mint Dai instead of buy it, they might bid lower on auctions because it just creates additional friction from the keeper\u2019s side.   1417\u00d7776 123 KB  For the downside case, of course, the curve is a bit more steeper. There are higher slippages, which mean lower bids.  1404\u00d7776 119 KB  The auction slippage curve is varied for different scenarios.  1419\u00d7790 55.5 KB   This is the second important input. I want to be clear that we did historical testing in the sense that we used historical data. The issue is that when we use only historical data from earlier this year we would see that Ether crashed at most up to only 35% but then we see days like Black Thursday happen.   We decided to take a stress test approach instead by putting some numbers in different cases. The numbers shown are basically calculating the output showing us what we are hedged against.   These crashes are applied on top of the GBM.   1419\u00d7793 104 KB   This tells us what amount of debt is liquidated when we have a price drop. This all comes down to how well collateralized the vaults are.   When we modeled for three different cases we lowered the cumulative distribution below a certain level of collateralization because I still believe that since we have all of these automated tools such as the DeFi server and yETH as well as a one hour time span due to OSM, we are able to unwind before we have a price drop. There will be some unbinding before we have a price drop but the question is how much. We approached this is by thinking that during a downside case we would have less unwinding and vice versa with an upside case.   We did use some historical data on this but the issue is that this is strictly related to user behavior, which changes all the time. Especially now that DeFi is currently related to farms and this data can change all the time.   1430\u00d7790 363 KB  This models for severe price drops using lower collateralization ratios, which results in a lot of debt liquidated.  1380\u00d7777 131 KB   Keep in mind that this is not an average of simulations. This is just one of the simulations.   In this case, a 50% drop would result in almost half of debt liquidated resulting in liquidation of 150 million Dai.   1401\u00d7779 84.3 KB  Whatever is below 100% collateralization is essentially MakerDAO\u2019s loss.  1416\u00d7787 74.6 KB   Out of the thousands of simulations we get a distribution of losses. This is how it looks like. What we are interested in is the average loss of 21.6% Dai.   The second variable is not related to risk premium. It looks at the tail of losses and shows us that we still need to be protected against the worst case losses in a sense that we need to know that Maker capital is able to dilute itself.   Essentially, if we agree with the inputs used, the results tell us that we should charge over 20% risk premium and have 30% of Dai available in Maker capital.   1388\u00d7780 373 KB  This upside case is the other extreme. The highest drop here is only 40%. Historically, however, we have not seen such high drops very often, so maybe the upside case here is pessimistic.  1398\u00d7780 140 KB  You can see that in this case we don\u2019t get as much Dai liquidated.  1430\u00d7789 53 KB  If you apply the slippage curve which is more optimistic, you would get a positive outcomes. You wouldn\u2019t see any losses because there is a penalty fee applied to it. The protocol is actually earning money instead of incurring any losses.  1428\u00d7791 58.4 KB  The risk premium is actually a negative number and shouldn\u2019t be charging anything to vaults because the protocol is actually making money. The worst case losses are zero and Maker doesn\u2019t need to dilute itself.  1420\u00d7785 365 KB  The inputs for the base case are somewhere in the middle. The collateralization ratios and Ether drops are more stable between the upside and downside cases shown earlier.  1421\u00d7790 64.1 KB  In this case, 70 million Dai liquidated is only 20% of the whole exposure.  1392\u00d7784 91.3 KB 1393\u00d7770 60.6 KB  The average loss of 4.2% shows that this should be the risk premium.  1425\u00d7793 128 KB   Maybe somebody is disappointed because we came up with this huge range between 0 to 20% but I wanted to present that there is actually not a big difference between the inputs we used, however, the outputs are quite different.   We want to make sure that modeling these inputs is subjective in some sense. Even though we are using historical data, trying to assess as much as possible what the outcome will be is very difficult because it comes down to user behavior.   A good example is say we have a lot of debt at 200%. If we run this simulation, it will show that there will be a lot of liquidations because we are modeling that not every user is awake and prepared to unwind itself.   However, this is not the case with yVault on some users. They are using automated tools that better protect themselves as well as Maker.   It comes down to user behavior and if you wanted to model this in an ideal scenario, you would need to assess every vault, which is how banks do it.   Here we aggregated things because it was more simple but really it\u2019s not as simple because the whole methodology is complex.   The final point is when governance decides which risk premium should be applied we should look at the current environment and see what\u2019s happening with liquidity and debt exposure to try to somehow move from one side to another side in order to assess risk premium.   Another option is if governance wants to be protected against the downside case because it could realistically happen and then this would require a 20% risk premium. But if we set this up, the loan portfolio would see a lot of unwinding and people will leave. But we will have lower numbers if we run the model again and again.   Eventually we will get a balance. Right now we need to be sure what we are doing with this information.   Discussion 40:40   Sam MacPherson: I am seeing this worst jump once per year, like -40% to -50%. In the Black Thursday event nothing had happened like that before so, I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s reasonable to think that it will happen once per year or should we be looking more at once per five-years or ten-years event? And how does that affect the numbers?   Primoz: That\u2019s a very good point. This is what I wanted to address basically. Our main goal is here to show what\u2019s the mechanics and what are the cause and effects. But this number is important, right? If you just think about it, if you have 150% collateralization and if you don\u2019t have more than 33% jump and all Auctions clear up with not really a huge slippage we have a big jump and auctions clear up without a big slippage, then you would expect no losses. And this was what was happening most of 2019. We had liquidations, they were quite severe, but the jumps were just around 30% so we were always protected. But once you get to this 45-50% it all becomes much different because you get to losses initially. From 150 you initially get below 100 collateralization level and Maker is already incurring a loss and then you put slippage on top of it and it\u2019s quite different.  To your point, what numbers should be applied? Like I said, this is not something that you want to use historical data on, especially in crypto. Ideally, you would like to crowdsource this information somehow. Maybe that\u2019s a way to go. I\u2019m not really sure on how to approach such things in the best way. Or you could say, you want to be hatched against this, let\u2019s say against 35, but then when you have an year with more than a 35% jump, you are not going to be compensating the loss for your risk premium, which is going to be lower.    Wouter: Would it make sense to turn the logic upside down and see these probabilities as targets? As you said, the policy is that we are protected against a drop of this size every year or every two years. I think that\u2019s turning the logic upside down, but it may actually make more sense if it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what the real numbers are.   Primoz: Yes, this is where perhaps I wasn\u2019t clear. This is this approach where you basically want to be hatched against a certain scenario: you said it in advance, then you see what\u2019s the risk premium and then you pursue that risk premium because you want to be hatched against that. Was this what you were thinking? Because this was one of the approaches I had in mind but perhaps I just wasn\u2019t clear.   Wouter: Yes, I think we are probably saying the same thing. Thank you for the clarification.   Sam MacPherson: What are the next steps for setting the ETH-A risk premium? Should we poll on what people want to set this to?   Primoz: Not sure if this is a question for me or Long. If you ask me, personally, I think we definitely need to update them. Here is the reason why I made the last post. How it\u2019s going now is that when we want to change the rate for a particular asset, we either change the rate base or we either set the risk premium. What I think is not proper is to set the risk premium higher just because we think we can also charge more in some sense. Because, we might get to an occasion where we\u2019re going to charge more but the risk is not proportional to that necessarily. So, I think risk premium is totally different topics to stability fees. Maybe there\u2019s something for future debates about what I was proposing there, but definitely we need to refresh all the risk premiums that should come specifically from the risk side not from the side where we increase risk premiums just because we wanted to reach higher stability fee and we were intuitively saying \u201cok, the risk increase, let\u2019s increase risk premium because we want to have higher rates.\u201d But what I was referring to in this post is, if you are increasing the rates, the important part is we should just know what the real risk premium is and then we compare it with it and then if you see a deficit or surplus, we should have a better guidance of what we are doing in terms of risk.   Sam MacPherson: Yes, I completely agree with that. The risk premium should be exactly set by the risk team only and not just Community popularity votes, in my opinion.   LongForWisdom: From my perspective, in terms of setting the stability fee or risk premium, I guess normally we would want to look at Primoz\u2019s model and potentially, I think, maybe we would want to look at this model and potentially poll on inputs. It could be a method of doing it, right? Like crowdsourcing, we can figure out what things we expect to happen or what sort of levels people are expecting from the market. I\u2019m not sure how scientific that would be but that would be one way of doing it. The other method is just what we\u2019ve been doing so far, right, and just poll directly on the value, like we\u2019ve been doing for the other assets so far.   Will Remor: I have a comment to that. I think it\u2019s what Primoz was mentioning during the call. It\u2019s important to always have the Community, to be open to potentially discuss some of the models and validate and have some scrutiny. I think that\u2019s a healthy thing that actually helps the risk team to also think about things that we are not considering during the model. As every model is only as good as its assumptions, so it\u2019s totally a valid discussion to have there. But, I think, as Primoz was saying, it\u2019s important as well that the data, particularly when the data is actually available with some historical wreath, like ETH for example, is taken into  account when actually doing those inputs. Although, we may not have ETH crashes happening at a 50% level every time, this market is highly volatile. We are not talking about shares or housing. So, it\u2019s important to take into consideration some of those aspects because we cannot control so much actually the main driver of some of those jumps, which is a user behavior. I think the approach there from Primoz, it\u2019s that it\u2019s important to always look at historical data, to historical distributions and then use some of that to take into account into the model. Because this model here, is not a predictive model in a sense, it\u2019s more like a stress testing and stress testing are based on scenarios, it\u2019s always based on what is some of the worst things that can actually happen so that you can have buffers to prepare for that. Therefore, with that in mind, after the scenarios are covered, you can have a discussion about what if once we have those scenarios in place, what is the likelihood of such a scenario being this bad in the next 12 months or so. Then, once you have plotted that, you have put your risk premiums in place, you can go back to the data on a forward-looking view. Whether those scenarios that are put together will may be too risk-adverse and then, looking at the data, the actuals versus the forecasted, you can try to potentially recalibrate some of those risks that you thought were maybe higher or lower than you expected, in which case you would have to go back to the data and potentially increase them if they were lower than expected. I think it can be relatively dynamic but it\u2019s important to base on the data and to look at some of the worst points of it and try to have a buffer for it rather than after the fact diluting MKR or doing things on a reactive basis rather than proactive.

I just posted in the Vault Compensation Plan v2 thread, you can read the short post at the end. Essentially, we\u2019re planning next poll going live on this coming Monday, September 7th, and running for two weeks until September 21st.   There\u2019s more clear details on how the Compensation calculations work that I put in that final post. I feel like I didn\u2019t do a great job of explaining it in my initial post. So, for anyone who is not totally clear on how the compensation works, feel free to reach out to me on chat but also look at that post.   One important update, is that I have made an oversight when listing the initial MKR amounts that would be the maximum required for each compensation percentage. I had been mistakenly multiplying the compensation, the collateral deficit percent by the debt tab rather than the value of the collateral at the time of liquidation. The post explains more of what I was talking about, but all of the numbers for MKR, because of that oversight, need to be multiplied by the 150% liquidation rate ratio. So, everything is going to be 1.5 times larger. All of the numbers should now be a 100% correct for the maximum amount that will be required. Hopefully that will give everyone a clear idea of what they\u2019re voting for as they consider these upcoming decisions.   One other note is: if the poll doesn\u2019t get at list 50% support for one of the Compensation options or if it resolves as opposing the current Compensation Plan but supporting Vault Compensation in principle, the working group, myself and everyone else involved, have determined that that would be a signal that we need a change of leadership. So, we would be available to anyone else who wanted to take the lead on the process. If a vote results either inconclusively or opposing the current Compensation Plan, I guess we consider that as a vote of no confidence and we would be letting someone else from the community take the lead at that point.

Total Dai supply up to  520 million Dai. 430 or so from ETH, 5 million bat, 6.22 million from UCSD, 78 million from WBTC, and 5 million from USDC-B.   1422\u00d7697 169 KB   Crazy amount of DAI-ETH trading volume. ETH price has gone up and down. Dai price basically steady at 1.01 and 1.02 and then come down to 1.0004 in the last couple of days. There is a lot of volatility with that number. Individual trades were still occurring at 1.03 and trades below peg. A fair amount of slippage given a tremendous amount of volume pushing through. Since those trades are on Uniswap that explains the slippage.   1285\u00d7514 68.3 KB   You can see the breakdown of volume and just here, in terms of DAI <> Eth, there\u2019s 230 million in trading volume . THis is high for a seven day average and a huge chunk on Uniswap.   1271\u00d7504 119 KB   For DAI<>USDC it echoes that same price movement where in the last few days it\u2019s come down a bit closer to the peg. A large part of the volume came from Curve.   1271\u00d7504 119 KB   DAI<>USD is also volatile but still showing a similar trend. With a decent chunk on Coinbase and some Kraken trades with fair amount of slippage.   1292\u00d7462 125 KB   DAI<>USDT similar price behavior, with a large chunk on trades on Curve.   1292\u00d7462 125 KB   Looking at underlying Dai supply, with BAT, we touched on this prior: utilization has come up as we hit 5 million mark.   1260\u00d7627 48.5 KB   For WBTC holding steady at it\u2019s cap where it\u2019s been for a bit.   1258\u00d7615 71.6 KB   USDC-A falling in utilization.   1258\u00d7615 71.6 KB   ETH-A however, in the last week it\u2019s been steady and growing. But the past two days with yETH vault activity the supply exploded. Again. From 350-420 million. In terms of big picture the Dai ETH supply has been growing and each time a new yield farm is discovered we see this curve accelerate.   1261\u00d7623 66.8 KB   In this time frame, with less opportunities the curve flattened. but again we\u2019re in the growth phase of the Dai ETH supply. We have to watch how much that can continue to grow.   1059\u00d7598 120 KB   Compound was one of the primary source for excess DAI supply, just about 160 million in the DSR and a similar amount in excess supply in compound. This supply had been a higher value so we\u2019re seeing some shift in capital deployment.   704\u00d7422 83.9 KB   We see 100 Million in Curve.   1260\u00d7586 129 KB   92 million of that is from yEarn. 70 from yETH and 22 from direct deposits.    When that number hit 70 million deposits paused. It will be interesting to watch with the multisig with the cap and the amount of mintings. If the cap moves again it\u2019s likely the demand is more than 70 million. The supply minted for that source is reasonably expected to grow.   1266\u00d7316 187 KB   This is the vault for the yETH deposits. That 70 million is sitting at 200% CR. A lot of this is set programmatically, Primoz talked about the risk management of this and it\u2019s on the lower end of collateralization. Yet it\u2019s managed more automatically than most vaults are. Weighing the type of that risk will be an interesting discussion.   1269\u00d7374 139 KB   Just to be aware, a tremendous amount of Dai supply is 250 % collateralized or lower. Which present a fair amount of risk.   1234\u00d7337 48.2 KB   A 15% drop in ETH would result in 25 mil Dai getting liquidated. If it hits $303 then its 130 million Dai being liquidated. That amount of Dai can bully the current available liquidity for Dai. We need to be aware of the types of risk that are stacking up, in terms of liquidation events. Right now, especially with the large amounts locked in these vaults, the potential for a single wall mass liquidation is a risk to consider.   1284\u00d7570 149 KB   An additional 20 million Dai in Balancer pools.   Risk for Collateral Types 01:06:10   Makerman: With transaction fees going higher, is there some concern about risk clumping in some of this? I guess the smaller things we\u2019re not too worried about, 10 million and under. Like WBTC in particular, as an example, what are the risks there?   Vishesh: In terms of the other Collateral type Vaults, these collateral types are in large clumped into large single-user Vaults. A decent percentage of this supply, of these Collateral types, is like that. So, you see 30 million of the WBTC is in a single-user Vault and then we have 21 million, 12 million, etc. Basically, there is a large grouping, or a fair amount of clustering, in the distribution of debt in Vaults. I\u2019m not sure if that was specifically your question, I didn\u2019t understand what you wanted to know about transaction fees but, yes, there is definitely a component of the risk to be aware of, that you have right now with the way things are working. A few large users or a few single-contract Vaults, etc. where a very large chunk of the supply is clustered into let\u2019s say  five to ten positions. There are quite a few Vaults within each Collateral type, but in terms of percentage of debt, it is pretty heavily clustered. So, there is risk clumping. Now, whether that\u2019s due to high transaction fees or not. Their transaction costs 100% but also just the nature of the way capital is deployed. What I think is going on more is, you see a few trading groups and a few smart contract projects where you have automated yield farming, etc. You see a few of these opportunities, where there\u2019s large amounts of capital that just by the nature of their size dwarf what individual users tend to do. So, it\u2019s not quite the same as saying like traditional industry in definition of industrial usage, but to some extend you are seeing more firms and projects and companies using these kinds of Vaults. It is a bit more of an industrial than a commercial usage of these products, and I think that causes the clustering of capital and, by extension, the clustering of the risk. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s specifically due to high transaction fees but that definitely contributes.    End Discussion  Long Term Vision For MakerDAO 01:10:45 Long Term Vision For MakerDAO   Sebastien Derivaux: It\u2019s not related to the meeting but, MakerMan just made a post in the forum for a long-term vision for MakerDAO. I did something similar ten days ago, so I just wanted to tell everyone that you can pass by. I think it would be very interesting.   LongForWisdom: Yes, it would be nice to see what people think on that. Thank you everyone for coming and I will see most of you again next week!

Today is Thursday, August 27th at 4 pm UTC. My name is LongForWisdom. I am the current MakerDAO Governance Facilitator. Forty people join me at the moment. I will briefly review the agenda, and then we\u2019ll start at the top. Anybody is free to interrupt and ask questions during any point of this call.   Discussions happen in the Forum.   Cyrus Younessi Leaving the Foundation 1:44   I\u2019ve got some sad personal news to share. Unfortunately, my time with the MKR foundation will be coming to an end over the next few weeks. It\u2019s a really sad announcement for me because I truly love this project and all the people behind it, from the community to the foundation. This was one of the first projects that got me interested in crypto.   A few quick words about what\u2019s\u2019 going on and what is coming next. First of all, a very sincere thank you to everyone in the community that has lent me support over the last 1.5 years. You guys are truly awesome. This is probably the most battle-hardened community in all of DeFi after all that Maker has been through in the past year and survived. This makes me optimistic for its future. Many may not know this, but I have been a member of the Maker community since 2016. It has been four years since I started following the Maker project, and it is absolutely crazy to see how much stronger and more sophisticated and mature the community is today vs. back then. When I first started getting involved in the foundation, it was because I believed that I had a lot of value to contribute. I had spent a few years doing fundamental research and trading for crypto. I thought that skillset fit very well for Maker risk. Today, I can look at the community and see 20 other people with the same level of knowledge and skills. If you look at the forums, you can see how the community has stepped up its game; we constantly have community members banging on the doors and trying to contribute. This is very awesome to see.   Along those lines, there is some good news: the operational transition for the Risk team. Currently, I\u2019m working on getting the rest of my team up and running to take over my role. Primoz and Marco, my two Slovenian teammates, have been running the whole show for some time now. I have nothing but the most confidence in them. One of my dark and shameful secrets is just how much of the credit I have been stealing; thank you and sorry, Primoz. They have been doing all of the collateral evaluations and monetary policy. They do an amazing job keeping track of everything going on in the broader DeFi ecosystem, which, of course, very important. These guys really understand Maker risk, maybe even better than I do at some point. I hope everyone in the MKR community will get to know them more closely. I\u2019m excited for them to become more public-facing, so give them a warm welcome. Also, a huge shoutout to Vishesh, he has been instrumental and life-saving to the Risk success. I\u2019m sure he will continue doing amazing work on data analysis and risk modeling. The best thing I\u2019ve ever done was to bring these three guys on board.   As for me, I\u2019ve been in this project for four years, and I want to try something new. But I can\u2019t just walk away, and I\u2019ll still be continuing to give to the community as a community member for some time. As to what\u2019s coming next, I accepted a role as Head of Risk - just joking - no, I\u2019ll be taking some time off to wind down and figure out what\u2019s next. Thank you, everyone. If anyone has any questions, I\u2019ll be around for a few more weeks.   Nik Kunkel: It\u2019s been an absolute pleasure to work with you, Cyrus. As someone burning the midnight oil, I see you rarely getting any sleep. You\u2019ve been focusing 100% on Maker, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s inspirational or depressing. It was good to have a fellow spirit. A big part of why we were able to get as far in the governance, risk, and collateral onboarding was because of you. A huge thank you from the entire community and from me. We\u2019re all the better for your involvement in this project.   LFW: It\u2019s been awesome working with you, Cyrus.   Chris_p: You\u2019ve done a great job, dude.   Cyrus: Thank you all, I appreciate the kind words.   Mariano Conti Also Leaving the Foundation 9:14   I\u2019m leaving too. Bye, everybody!   Of course, that\u2019s not all. Not sure how to follow Cyrus, since the Governance and Risk meetings have been mostly his thing along with LFW and Rich (who already left a few weeks ago). I agree. This is probably going to be the most depressing GnR call. To say a few things, I joined the Maker project about four years ago. My crypto life has been tied to Maker, from building the first Single Collateral Dai and being paid with those proto-SAI tokens to the MCD launch and deploying MCD from this very room and this very computer. It has been a huge honor to have been a part of it.   Like Cyrus said, I will be stepping away from my role in the foundation but will continue to be a big part of the Maker protocol and community as a voter, community member, and MKR holder. I want the best for the protocol. You will still see me around, and I\u2019ll be taking it easy for the next couple of weeks. I will be spending less time on twitter and hopefully sleeping more. I have no immediate plans. I won\u2019t be going to another protocol and want to relax for a bit. The smart contracts team is amazing, and you probably already know all of them. The fort is well secure in that regard. I want to thank everyone. You will probably see me in a few weeks on the governance calls. I\u2019ll be joining again, and I think there will be a few things that I will be able to bring the project as a community member that I couldn\u2019t as a member of the foundation. I\u2019m really looking forward to it.   LFW: Thank you very much, Mariano. You\u2019ve always been a super positive influence on all of us.   Nikkunkel: Without Mariano, there would not have been a Maker. Remember Sai? The first dashboard with the RGB buttons and two dozen buttons that you would have to press in the right order. You can thank Mariano for that. Supreme example of back-end engineers cobbling together a usable front-end for testing. At some point, it was testing, but then we went into launch. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to be ok with that (lol). On a personal level, Mariano, you\u2019ve been a mentor to me. You\u2019ve relented to a lot of questions from me, which have made me so much better. Mariano also got me into the Oracles; he was the original Oracle guy. From creating his own baby and being comfortable enough to hand it off.  I love man, and I\u2019ll see you in Argentina in December.     Domain Team Updates Wil Barnes Smart Contracts Team Update 15:24   A handful of bullet points. Liquidations 1.2 spell is slotted to be deployed tomorrow.   Next week, we have office hours modifiers, so it won\u2019t be able to be cast until Monday, between Monday and Friday.   The spell for PAXUSD and tether for September 4th, the same view, but there are office hours modifiers on that which will be created to not cast on Labor Day so between Tuesday and Friday.   Dark spell, spoken about in the last governance call, is up for comment until September 9th.     Nik Kunkel Oracles Team Update 16:50   In the past week, we had an application to get whitelisted by wiring on the ETHUSD OSM for their delegated Vaults. I had initiated a fast-track signal request on the forum so we could get that into this week\u2019s polling cycle. It looks like the vote passed, so that will be included in this Friday\u2019s executive vote.   I just wanted to touch on, really quickly, the reason why I initiated this signal request to fast-track it. It\u2019s because I think we\u2019ve gotten a bit too comfortable with the Peg being above $1, and it\u2019s not even about the magnitude anymore; it\u2019s just the fact that it\u2019s still above $1, and we haven\u2019t been able to push it down. To me, anything that has the potential to generate very large amounts of Dai, I think, is worth fast-tracking. I think it\u2019s imperative that we get this under control, and the potential that I see with the delegated ETH Vaults is huge. Right now, on Yearn, you can lock up your yCRV,  which is just a basket of stable coins, and you are earning somewhere close to 100% of your APY, which in crypto terms maybe some people yawn at, but in traditional finance, that\u2019s an amazing return, right? You have a lot of people right now who have very big ETH bags, and they\u2019re borrowing against their ETH using like a Vault and then using that Dai to yield farm, but it\u2019s kind of risky because they constantly have to monitor their position, so they\u2019re either collateralized very highly, so they can get some sleep, or they\u2019re losing a lot of sleep by being on the edge, like Mr. Mariano here who posted a twitter picture the other day of being like a 152% collateralized. So, because this is risky, there\u2019s probably a lot of people on the sideline who don\u2019t want to take on that risk. Having this Vault, where you can just lock up your ETH, and it\u2019s automatically taking out a bunch of Dai and making sure programmatically that that Vault is not getting liquidated, I think that\u2019s going to be huge. If this doesn\u2019t generate 40-50 million Dai within a month or two, I would be disappointed. So, I just wanted to give some color on why I thought that this proposal was urgent because I didn\u2019t want it to seem like there was any kind of favoritism with wiring or anything like that. I\u2019m purely looking at it from a Dai supply type of perspective.   Cyrus Risk Team Update 20:35  We spent last week working a lot on liquidations 1.2 parameters, working on analysis there. We also did a research analysis piece on cTokens as potential collateral types. We are doing some final revisions there, and then we\u2019ll be posting that to the forums as well, some interesting ideas around cTokens. We\u2019ve been working on ETH-a and ETH-b risk premium calculations. Those are done and going through final revision, so a few more days for that, unfortunately, but will be posted very soon. Same with Chainlink. The evaluation is also completed, but we just need to do some final sign-offs. Hoping all of these can come next week.

MIPs Charles St. Louis Weekly MIPs Update 25:46 904\u00d7513 82.2 KB 1190\u00d7656 241 KB 1195\u00d7661 196 KB 1162\u00d7658 287 KB 1042\u00d7650 113 KB LongForWisdom(GF) Governance Cycle Review 32:00   This a discussion on how the last Governance Cycle went and essentially what is going to happen in the next one.   We had three proposals submitted this month, which were the Declaration of Intent (forward Guidance), the domain work requirements for onboarding LRC and the sub-proposal called for personnel off-boarding Rich.   All three of those were accepted into the Cycle, but only two passed the inclusion polls, which was the Declaration of Intent (forward Guidance) and the sub-proposal to remove Rich. So we lost LRC at that stage, which was a little bit of a surprise for some. I know many of the people I spoke to expected it to be included. I think that might be the first time we\u2019ve seen something that hasn\u2019t been included, or at least it\u2019s definitely the first time we\u2019ve seen something like a collateral onboarding proposal not being included. That\u2019s potentially worthy of notes. I think the plan is to resubmit it next Cycle. We\u2019ll get a better idea of whether not being included was a result of a lack of participation or was an actual objection to the collateral type itself. A couple of people were saying that there were similar gas prices around that time, which is true, and it was one whale who voted against and pretty much carried the poll. Both of those are true. Hopefully, it will encourage more people to participate if they want to see it onboarded.   As Charles mentioned, the Declaration of Intent and the subproposal to remove Rich officially are both still up for Executive and that Executive has until around this time Friday to pass before it expires, so there\u2019s still a chance that it will pass, which is good.   In terms of participation in the various actual sections, similar to what we\u2019ve seen previously for the inclusion polls, the same 17K Maker participating again. And in the Governance Poll bundle, we saw 3.5K Maker participate. I think last month we had 18K, but the two months prior, we had like 5K or 4K, so it\u2019s potentially a return to average, based on the high gas prices.   In conclusion, we see what we\u2019ve seen for the last two months, some amount of MKR is participating in the Governance Cycle, while a larger portion is not. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a bad thing because the point of the monthly Governance Cycle is that if you\u2019re only paying attention at the end, you can vote and have it, in fact, right, and you can use the previous votes to inform your decision at that point. Obviously, it would be great to have more participation, but I don\u2019t think we are at troublesome levels yet. I think we\u2019ll hopefully see more participation next governance cycle because there\u2019s a fair few things that are going to be submitted. I think it\u2019ll be a fuller Cycle, so hopefully, they\u2019ll attract more attention.   Analysis Vishesh Choudry Relevant Links MCD System Stats MCD System Stats Alt DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs Maker Vault Stats The State of the Peg 37:21 dai.descipher.io1329\u00d7657 284 KB  Broad strokes in terms of Dai<>ETH trades, in the last few days, the prices have been fairly volatile and trending slightly upward in the $1.01 range and pushing into $1.02. There has been a fair bit of spread on those trades lately. Part of that will likely be contributed to the volatility in ETH price as there hasn\u2019t been an insane amount of movement in terms of farming opportunities and the yield that is available there.  949\u00d7336 108 KB  In terms of the Dai<> USDC pair, the trend is a bit clearer, with trades dominated by Curve. About two weeks ago, the Dai peg dropped down a bit due to the end of a few farming yield opportunities, and now it has kind of stayed flat and then risen a bit in the last day or two. This may be in part due to market volatility and not just farming behavior.  1331\u00d7500 216 KB  For Dai<>USD pair, there is a bit more spread than the Dai<>USDC paired. There is a lot more variability in the sizes of trades on the Dai<>USDC pair. This chart is always a bit messier. But you can see more clearly the moments of run-up and liquidity crunch.  894\u00d7455 108 KB  Dai<> USDT is similar to Dai<>USDC.  875\u00d7415 161 KB  Overall, Dai supply is about 440 million.    210 million Dai in DSR, primarily through Compound, and 230 million Dai spread across other addresses, holders, and contracts.  1303\u00d7650 84 KB   In terms of collateral, the largest group is, of course, ETH. Here we see that there is a continuing trend that the Dai supply minted from ETH is continuing to grow. Obviously, at an increased pace since July, but that pace appears to be slowing down a bit. It will be interesting to watch whether there continues to be a significant supply of Dai minted from ETH. I believe we will see that curve accelerate during times of more frothy yield and slow down or resume pace of growth in a more steady-state environment, especially if ETH price continues to appreciate.  It will be interesting if there will be a drying up of yields or, if ETH price drops a bit, it will be interesting to see the amount of Dai minted from ETH. For now, it appears to be continuing growth.    824\u00d7420 64.9 KB  USDC<>DAI is a more instanced vault, where there are a few large individual users minting and repaying. When this happens, there is more impact on the supply curve and a jankier graph. This has not been as heavily used in the last couple of weeks. It is sitting more or less in the 10-20 million Dai range.  1287\u00d7636 48.3 KB  WBTC has continued to cap out as the goal-posts have continued to move. With the recent increase, it took a few days to reach around 80 million. It appears there is a fair amount of demand for utilization, but again, similar to USDC; it is primarily dominated by a few large users. This will be a discussion point for the community to determine how each collateral type is used.  1286\u00d7620 54.5 KB  A few large movements for BAT, with a jump to about 5 million Dai minted. Partially this is due to a decreased capability due to using/generating yield on other platforms. Presumably, someone long on BAT may want to get more leverage out of that capital, and Maker is the way to do this. This is to be expected for this particular collateral pool, although it is not a significant share of the collateral pool.  1277\u00d7479 103 KB 1292\u00d7354 45.9 KB 1322\u00d7627 303 KB   In terms of what the collateral looks like, there has been a hop-scotching back and forth in terms of collateral utilization. As the ETH price has appreciated, we are seeing an increase in the collateralization. As it decreased a little bit, we say that the CR ratios held constant. Over the last couple of days, we have seen a little bit of a re-increase in collateralization for some of these larger vaults. They are still sitting in a medium risk scenario around 200-250% collateral ratios. This is definitely something to keep an eye out, and there are signs of life in that people do seem to be managing their collateralization. I think we see more of a movement in the CR with the ETH price moving than when it is more or less constant. This means that people aren\u2019t necessarily managing their CR as much as just letting it stay somewhat constant and then fluctuating with the ETH price.   Some of these larger vaults are 200%,250%,300%. If the ETH price were to hit $280, you would see a huge chunk of Dai liquidated, which is something to be aware of in terms of risk parameters and liquidation structures. This is in terms of the liquidation 1.2 structures, and what would happen in the instance of these liquidations; just something to be aware of.   USDC is rather boring to talk about. It is where you would expect and is close to the line.   848\u00d7432 85.4 KB  WBTC is interesting to note, as some of the larger vaults are maintaining a bit more collateral, although there are at least three large WBTC vaults that are sitting around 160% collateralization. It\u2019s always going to be a bit different than ETH, but it is important to note since we do not discuss this one very often.  957\u00d7141 17.6 KB  To look at Dai supply, a lot of that sits in Compound, with 210 million Dai sitting excess in Compound, which finds its way back in the DSR.  1164\u00d7677 204 KB 1159\u00d7679 185 KB  This is roughly half of the Dai that has been minted. The remainder, at a glance, shows a decent chunk of the remaining supply in Curve, Balancer, Aave, and Zombie finance pools. These are different opportunities for users to obtain yield. Obviously, there is a much larger stake in some of these previous yield farming opportunities that have cropped up and have flown out, as expected. The remaining 230 million Dai supply is definitely a moving target, and there is a fair amount of volume flow.     We still see 25 million or so of that in Curve, which is a very decent chunk.   Comparing the volume, USDC has a significantly larger balance share in Curve, but the amount of trading volume per coin on those platforms is roughly comparable to Dai in USDC. You can see that Dai is moving around quite a bit even though it may be holding smaller shares than other tokens on these platforms.     Here we see Balancer, with about 20 million in that particular Dai pool.  Discussion 50:20   Nik Kunkel: Earlier, you showed a chart that showed that if ETH price goes up, collateralization increases, and as the ETH price goes down, it decreases. That all makes intuitive sense. But is the magnitude of those changes, especially when ETH is going down, is the magnitude proportional to the price change in ETH, or are we actually seeing people lever up when the price is going down? Are they falling into the drops, or is it just price movement?   Vishesh: I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s necessarily the right phrasing. But, it\u2019s definitely basic math that as the ETH price goes up, collateralization goes up. What we\u2019ve seen historically with Dai is that, after that collateralization has gone up, people tend to,  in different degrees at different times, do some sort of re-leveraging where they end up lowering their collateralization ratio in response either by minting more Dai or by removing a little bit of that unnecessary collateral. In the recent environment, it tends to be minting more Dai, and then, when the ETH price comes down a little bit, I think we tend to see a compensatory behavior where people re-collateralize in an anticipatory kind of way to protect against liquidation. In the past, that tended to be adding more collateral back; lately, I think either there\u2019s a decent amount of utilization of people\u2019s capital and that it\u2019s deployed in a lot of different places or some other potential explanation. But, I think that people tend to manage their Dai balance more than their collateral balance, possibly.   ",

                    "content": " End-Discussion  yETH Vault Launch 53:20   Cyrus: The basic idea is that there is this DeFi protocol called yEarn. One of their upcoming products will be ingesting ETH. Using a strategy inside their yVault, as they call it, and yVaults are not to be confused with Maker Vaults, very different concept, similar names. This yVault, which takes ETH, called yETH, will be opening up a Maker Vault and minting Dai at a 200% collateralization ratio, I believe. They will take that Dai, and they will deposit it into the curve yPool, which in return, they would get an LP token on that yPool, which is called yCRV. Essentially, yCRV acts like a stable coin, but in actuality, it\u2019s like a claim or a liquidity provider token for this yPool. And then, it will yield farm with that. That\u2019s the summary from the high level, although I think there is definitely a lot of confusing terms in there.   One of the cool things about this strategy is that they want to be able to read from the OSM so that they can protect their Maker ETH-A Vault if the ETH price starts to fall. This makes it safer for them, and I believe they\u2019ve requested whitelist access; that\u2019s what Nik was referring to earlier. I think the things that this community needs to consider are:   Any blowback risks, anything that might be contagious from yEarn into Maker. I think from the perspective of reading off the oracles, that\u2019s fairly harmless; I\u2019ll let Nik comment on that. On the risk side, the benefit is that an enormous amount of Dai could be created depending on the popularity of this product. Dai deposited into the curve yPool has a direct downward pressure on the Dai price, which is obviously something we are all interested in. Over the last couple of weeks, we saw the price of Dai get pretty close to $1, which was a direct result of the CRV farming from the yPool. I think that\u2019s the main positive point.   The main negative point might be, in theory, as a community, we\u2019ve never come to a consensus on how we feel about users taking advantage of the OSM in the one-hour delay. Of course, it\u2019s totally possible, and plenty of individuals do it. But, this could be more from like an institutional level scale, it could be hundreds of millions, and we have to explore what the consequences there are. Basically, on average, the collateralization ratio for Maker as a protocol would be lower because people can take advantage of the OSM, but I\u2019ve already mentioned the upsides, so that is something that the community should probably discuss from a risk angle. If there\u2019s a huge ETH drop, I\u2019m actually not sure of what the strategy would be to deal with that. But, it may not be to MakerDAO\u2019s favor.      Upward pressure on Dai when unwinding yETH Vault 58:47   Akash: It\u2019s great that on the first side, it\u2019s adding a bunch of Dai to the y-curve Pool. That should decrease the Dai price, and it\u2019s a great thing, right? What I\u2019m a little worried about is, when ETH drops, and then they come to buy Dai to close out their position, aren\u2019t they going to be putting a bunch of upward pressure on Dai when they are trying to close their position?   Cyrus: Well, they wouldn\u2019t be buying it, they would just be removing it from the yPool, which skews the pricing on Curve, but it\u2019s not nearly the same as going into Coinbase or Oasis base and lifting the offer.   LongForWisdom: The Dai isn\u2019t guaranteed to be there on the curve pool, and that\u2019s part of the issue, I think.   Akash: I think the potential solution is, if the Dai is there, they\u2019re removing it and obviously closing out their ETH-A Vault. But, if the Dai is not there, then somehow being smart enough to use the USDC Vault to mint Dai to help temporarily close out their ETH Vault.   Cyrus: Yes, I think there\u2019s a number of ways these strategies could be improved. This is just like a first pass, right? I think this is the most complicated strategy to date. Given there\u2019s no leverage built into it, doing something like USDC could be something that, in theory, is entirely unrelated to this. That would be more along the lines of those Keeper DAO strategies, where you have a bunch of people deposit USDC or Dai or whatever into a smart contract, and its job is to be on Auctions or stuff like that. So, I think that\u2019s definitely a smart way of doing things but also maybe somewhat distinct from this strategy directly.   Akash: I guess my other concern is if it\u2019s audited. I mean, that a concern for the initial yEarn and ETH person, right?   Cyrus: That\u2019s why I was saying that we need to think about potential blowbacks, so that\u2019s one right there. The community discussed it over the years, but if there\u2019s a hundred million Dai sitting in some exchange or some smart contract or whatever, and then it gets hacked, what effect does that have on MakerDAO? I don\u2019t think it has ever really been this community\u2019s mandate to oversee what other users do with Dai, and I think it\u2019s a bit unclear on what impact it would have anyways.   Akash: Again, this is my personal opinion. It sounds like something that could help the Dai Peg, so generally, I\u2019m in favor of it. Obviously, there are risks for the individual user who goes to yEarn.   Cyrus: I think a good way of thinking about it is that maybe they could be considered like a superuser. Because, potentially, they could dwarf any other single individual Vault, even the largest ones that we\u2019ve ever seen. So, it could be interesting. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to consider all of the cases at this stage, but for now, the proposal focuses on the Oracle whitelist, and so I think that could be the primary concern for now. I\u2019m not sure.   LongForWisdom: It\u2019s worth mentioning that this isn\u2019t something we can stop from happening. This is the usage of Maker Vaults. We need to be aware of this happening, right?   Cyrus: Even without the Oracle whitelist, this strategy could still work; it just wouldn\u2019t be as effective on their part. I think it\u2019s a question of, on the Oracle side, does MakerDAO want to help transition this? Is that accurate?   Nik Kunkel: Yes, that\u2019s what I was going to say. They are still going to do this, right? They can still look at the Oracle prices; they just do it in a less trustless way. So, if we want to make this decentralized, then they need access to the OSM. But, this thing is happening either way, so it\u2019s best to at least do it in a controlled manner. We don\u2019t want to risk surprise liquidations, so I think it\u2019s in our best interest to do this in a legit way.   LongForWisdom: I feel it may be good to focus the conversation on the Governance considerations that this is going to bring up. If this proves to be really popular, then we potentially want to go up the debt ceiling fairly rapidly, right? Just other considerations that we need to be aware of as a result of this coming into existence.   Cyrus: Taking a step back from Maker and thinking from a broader yield farming DeFi perspective, this is how I\u2019ve been viewing things. The yCRV yEarn strategy, which is called yyCRV, has been very popular. I think upwards of a hundred million in there. A lot of that comes from borrowed stable coins either from Maker or Compound, so the ultimate source of collateral is ETH for certainly a good percentage of this. For anyone who\u2019s tried this strategy, you know that there is a considerable amount of maintenance and anxiety and headache, trying to manage your liquidation risk and liquidity risk actually for the strategy. If that can all be automated away and the yEarn strategy can even manage the liquidation risk by reading off the OSM, then I think this is going to be enormously popular. Because, even with all the current difficulties, it\u2019s already ingested upwards of a hundred million. So, this could go a lot higher, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this easily tacks on a couple of hundred million Dai over the next couple of months after this strategy is live, assuming the contract is battle-hardened and audited and all of that. People start to understand exactly how the liquidation management works. The downside is we are going to have to wrestle with very quickly ballooning Dai supply off of the ETH collateral. Over the years, I\u2019ve started to realize that it\u2019s just going to be maybe one of those endlessly no-lack of consensus debates. Some people love ETH as collateral and think it\u2019s super safe; others feel strongly in the opposite way. Obviously, a big consideration for the circuit breaker and liquidations 1.2 and liquidations 2.0 has been to allow MakerDAO to more efficiently process large collateral liquidations, especially with ETH. So, I think this is going to be one of those ongoing conversations.   Nik Kunkel: Yes, I think this is definitely going to increase disproportion of the Dai portfolio that\u2019s backed by ETH, there\u2019s no question about that. The trade-off here is for Peg stability, which is only going to be achieved by minting a bunch of Dai, which this enables us to do. But the trade-off is that we are more relying on ETH, and, even with the liquidation changes that we\u2019re adding,  we definitely increase the long-tail risk for a Black Thursday type of scenario because we are now even more exposed to ETH. If you look at USDC, it was at one point a very significant chunk of the collateral portfolio, and that\u2019s since fallen by the wayside. I think it\u2019s worth it, but it\u2019s definitely a serious risk to consider the externalities. And this is all assuming that this yETH delegated Vault thing is super successful; if it\u2019s not, then it\u2019s not a big risk. But, to be honest, I don\u2019t see the latter scenario happening.    Outro  LongForWisdom  Closing Comments  Thank you, everyone, for coming, and I will see you next week.

My name is LongForWisdom; I am the governance facilitator for MakerDAO. We have the usual agenda for this call. It will include updates from the major groups. We also have a couple of segments from various people for a yearly review. And then we will wrap things up. Feel free to interrupt to make comments or questions. You\u2019re more than welcome to do so. We\u2019d love to hear from you, so feel free to chat. A couple of reminders concerning this call and the holidays. In January, we\u2019ll be adjusting the time of this call back by one hour to 17:00 UTC. I think that\u2019s slightly easier for people in the US west coast. Keep an eye out for that in January. It will be on the agenda. As for my second point: this will be the last call for this year. For the next two weeks, we will suspend the usual governance cycle given the holiday periods. I think many people will be out of action, so it makes sense to take a break for those two weeks. This gives everyone a break, which is nice because people have been working hard. All right, I think that covers my introduction. Before we jump into updates, Lucas, do you want to say something briefly? Deeper Discussions happen in the Forum.   Lucas Manuel Leaving Maker  Lucas: Hi, everyone. My name is Lucas. I\u2019m on the Smart Contract team at Maker, I am a mandated actor as well. I just wanted to tell everyone that tomorrow will be my last day at the Maker Foundation and as a mandated actor. I loved working here and learning a lot from all of you guys. I am stepping down as a mandated actor. Hopefully, I\u2019ll have enough bandwidth to come back and help out in the future. Thanks for all the good times, and I hope to stay in touch with all of you. Thank you.  LongForWisdom: Thanks for letting us know. I should share the sad faces of those in the chat. It\u2019s been great having you around and chatting with you. Anybody else wants to say anything for Lucas? Christopher: I\u2019ll say something. I just wanted to say thank you, Lucas, for everything you\u2019ve done for the project. I\u2019ve interviewed a lot of people in my life. When we first interviewed Lucas, I walked in with a sort of playbook of how I would go through the interview. He already had all the multi-collateral DAI code up, he was running simulations through it, and he just blew the interview out of the water. He didn\u2019t disappoint after we hired him either. You\u2019ve been super useful. It is probably a bit of a unicorn when it comes to finding somebody who joins a team and comes up to speed and starts working on stuff. It\u2019s a significant loss, but we wish you the best in your future endeavors. I hope you find the time to eventually come back and help us see 10 billion DAI or something like that. Lucas: Thank you, Chris, that means a lot. I\u2019ve loved working for you guys, and it\u2019s been great, so thanks for that. Brianmcmichael: This is definitely a setback for the team, but you\u2019ve been great, and we wish you the best at the next thing.    Weekly Updates LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 05:05 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated. Discussions   MakerDAO Contributors compensation brainstorm  SebVentures brings forth how the DAO will pay contributors once the Maker Foundation steps aside. We had an active discussion started by SebVentures. He initiated a brainstorm around how contributors in MakerDAO should be compensated. It was a critical topic and had a good level of engagement. I encourage people to read if people are curious about that and leave a comment with their thoughts.   [OPINION: 2021 Till Infinity] MakerDAO: Community Owned and Operated]([OPINION: 2021 Till Infinity] MakerDAO: Community Owned and Operated)  ElProgreso details his thoughts on retaining and attracting talent as MakerDAO enters a new stage of autonomy. We had a piece from ElProgreso on a similar topic: MakerDAO community-owned and operated, which talks about retaining and attracting talent as MakerDAO enters a new stage of autonomy and growth.    TUSD is undergoing a material change to its ownership structure. Is there a process for reducing exposure in the event of a material change?  shane points to a recent shift in a decently collateralized asset for Maker. Check out the discussion and share your opinion about what this means for the DAO. We had a threat from Shane pointing to a shift that we\u2019ve recently just seen in TUSD. The ownership of either MKR and TUSD token, at least possibly the trust token company, has some discussion going on there. We can discuss this a little bit later if we have time because I know a couple of people feel strongly about it.   We had some other more extensive discussions continuing. Hexonauts, Sam McPherson introducing dssGovRewards continued to see discussion. As has the thread from MagoCrypto proposing to mirror Oasis on IPFS.  hexonaut introduces Rewards for MKR Voting and asks for feedback from governance in this direction. MagoCrypto proposes launching an oasis mirror on IPFS, which raises questions on what it means for the DAO to take responsibility with UI\u2019s into the Maker Protocol.    Signal Requests   Vault Compensation Working Group Payment  monet-supply proposes payment for the black Thursday compensation working group from the system surplus. The vault compensation working group signal poll continues. I believe it\u2019s ending soon. I know this wasn\u2019t the fondest memory for many of us. Still, if you have opinions on the working group\u2019s payment, I will encourage you to leave your comments and vote.    PSM Parameters  Primoz puts forward some signals to determine the initial parameters of the PSM deployment. We had the signal request for the PSM parameters, which is on-chain this week, and it\u2019s now finished. I still haven\u2019t checked the results because, for some reason, I always forget each week. I\u2019m assuming it passed.   Over the last few weeks, I spoke about documenting some of the governance parameters. Those documents are now live. They\u2019re on the community development portal and will be linked to relevant polls. Hopefully, this means for users voting for the first time or aren\u2019t familiar with the system can understand things, for example, the stability fee, the debt ceiling, the dust parameter, the debt floor parameter, or the surplus buffer, and etc. You can understand what these parameters are, what they do, what they mean, and the trade-offs between changing them before voting. We\u2019re also going to continue to work on the documentation. Some of the new things we\u2019re bringing in, such as the PSM or the DCIM, will probably happen within the new year. We also had a couple of people asking how the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module works under the hood and what the gap parameter means specifically. I think documenting that will be useful.  Christopher Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 09:24  Last week we finally saw the DsChief v1.2 activated, which was great; it launched. My palms have officially stopped sweating not only because we launched it but also because we put through the first executive. Now we know that it\u2019s working. That was a little unnerving, but I can talk about it now since we\u2019re past it. Last week, the executive included the DC auto-line for ETH-B. It had UNI and renBTC as collateral types and some number of changes. I think we set stablecoins to zero, and we added an oracle approval for YFI as a proxy. There was an assortment of stuff in there, and all of that went through and passed, which is great. This week, we\u2019ve been working on AAVE, UNI-V2-DAI-ETH LP tokens, and MIP21, which is Real-World Assets. This has been a pretty difficult executive to try and get through. For one thing, it came on the heels of a major executive from last week, so we had to start late on this one. Even with the AAVE edition, I\u2019m sure everyone saw the smart contract bug that AAVE had in their token. That\u2019s a little unnerving. The LP tokens require a huge oracle code update to work, and that\u2019s been a little bit non-standard for us. Therefore, that process is taking a bit longer. Will and I have been working on MIP21, and I regret to say that I think we\u2019re going to have to push it off to the next cycle. We\u2019re just not finished. I got some of the deploy stuff working, and we\u2019re still working on the tests. However, it still needs a big final review because there are still several tests that need to be completed. It\u2019s just not quite ready this week, but I\u2019m pretty confident that it\u2019ll be prepared for the first round of executives next year. Sorry to everyone who\u2019s been pushing on that really hard, but this one slipped. We still have the Dss.exec lib in the review. None of us have looked at it yet, although I think we\u2019re going to switch to using that for next year. This will probably happen first thing before we do any additional collateral deployments. There\u2019s no onboarding work from our team or in general. I wanted to thank Naz for the work that he did on AAVE. I wanted to thank Will for his work on MIP21, and Lucas for the LP tokens. Also, Brian\u2019s the one constructing the spell, and Sam, I believe, is still working on his implementation of the PSM. Although you know we have no input into that, everyone\u2019s been working really hard to execute the end of the year; thank you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to go over what we\u2019re gonna do next week, and so that\u2019s pretty much it for smart contracts since we won\u2019t reconvene until next year.  Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 13:57  Apart from the things that Chris Mooney just mentioned, we\u2019ve mostly been working on the Uniswap LP oracle. We\u2019ve had the base code for it for almost a couple of months now. We\u2019ve just been adding the scaffolding around it in terms of the admin functionality. There\u2019s also a fee that Uniswap has that isn\u2019t turned on right now. It\u2019s not a trading fee, but it\u2019s a protocol fee. It\u2019s deducted from whenever you mint or burn LP tokens. Therefore, whenever you\u2019re adding or removing liquidity to one of the pools if the fee is turned on and siphons off 0.05 percent. We had a back and forth for a while regarding whether it\u2019s even worth implementing. It really has such a minimal effect on the LP token price. The much more relevant thing is that you have the one-hour oracle security module delay in an OSM environment. Therefore, you have much more slippage and price difference slippage just from waiting that one hour time period than you ever would from this point zero five percent fee being turned on or off. Ultimately, we did settle in the direction of correctness. We ended up implementing it to an extent. It is not ideal because we usually want to code-freeze things a while before we put them into production, but the change is relatively minor. It\u2019s basically just an \u201cif\u201d branch off the regular happy path, so it should probably be fine. That being said, anytime you deploy new contracts, especially ones that have the complexity that the new Uniswap LP token has, there\u2019s always a risk attached. Not only do we have regular collateral risk, but now we have significant smart contract risk. That smart contract risk is not a surprise to us. We knew that this would be the case and hence why we recommended the debt ceiling to be reasonably low at the start. Tomorrow, we get the first LP pair in. Early next year, I would hope that we get a lot more of the other ones in, such as USDC-ETH, WBTC-ETH, and a couple of the other high liquidity pairs. It applies to the SushiSwap pairs as well. Therefore, if there are some high liquidity pairs, this all translates over. But to start with, we\u2019ll have the debt ceiling really crippled for the first one. In effect, this will just act as a bounty. If there is some kind of exploit in the oracle contract, someone should exploit it, and we can only lose up the debt ceiling. That\u2019s the state of things. Now that we\u2019ve delivered on the LP stuff, we\u2019re basically going to start taking a closer look at the real-world asset. That\u2019s going to be our priority going into the next year.  Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 18:50  In regards to collateral evaluations so far, we\u2019ve managed to perform all of the evaluations that were planned. tBTC is still missing, but it\u2019s in the final review, so it should be released soon. We\u2019re also looking at the collateral priority spreadsheet to decide which assets to evaluate next. It seems that the highest-ranked collaterals are liquidity mining-based tokens. This probably means we should first have a yield farming feature implemented if we want to attract some demand for this kind of collateral. This is why we started working on the cUSDC crop joint risk assessment. We\u2019re currently making simulations on the parameters that were already proposed for USDC; Particularly how a 110% liquidation ratio would work out when we start supplying larger amounts of uSDC in Compound. I hope we can get the risk assessment ready for the end of the year to begin onboarding farming assets for early next year. We were also assessing the situation with tUSD. There was a discussion about wheter we should start reducing exposure to tUSD after this recently announced acquisition from Asian investors. I noted in the forums we had discussed that we will be mitigating this potential risk tomorrow if the PSM vote passes. The executive vote also included to set the debt ceiling on current stablecoin vaults zero. This should be mitigated, but personally, I think there\u2019s no real reason to rush at this point because we still might see some of these vaults unwind on their own. Still, it\u2019s worth discussing how we could potentially reduce exposure to tUSD and prepare some kind of plan. Whether having some sort of controlled liquidation or selling collateral directly by the protocol remains to be seen. Regarding our other work, we are lately working on improving our value risk models, which are being improved to start accounting for correlations between collateral assets. This should provide governance a good input to start assessing how well the current surplus buffer protects us against certain events. We got a lot of help from Andy, who is another known member from forums. He was accommodating at improving the value risk model, and we should have results soon. Additionally, there was also one other community member. The tool he developed monitors DAI liquidity and DAI flows between larger addresses that he was able to whitelist. This helps us assess the state of DAI markets and DAI holdings. I suggest taking a look at it. That\u2019s it from our side this year if anyone has any questions.  LongForWisdom: Do we have an ongoing review process for improved collaterals, or is it up to the DAO to act If something changes? Primoz: Is this meant for the collaterals that are already onboarded? LongForWisdom, I think so, yes. Primoz: I\u2019m not really sure how to answer this. LongForWisdom: Do we monitor the developments with the current collateral types and potentially change things if they need to be changed? Primoz: We measure liquidity and assess the risk premiums and debt ceilings if this was the question. When we published the spreadsheet where risk payments and debt ceilings were updated, we went through this every month. We proposed some changes to specific debt ceilings and interest rates. But other than that, it\u2019s a regular onboarding process. Frank: Hypothetically, if we had to delist one of the collaterals, has there been a risk analysis for such a situation? Primoz: So far, we haven\u2019t had such a situation, but it\u2019s a good question concerning how to perform it. Ideally, you lower the debt ceiling to zero, and then you need to have a liquidation plan. There has been no such occasion yet. I guess we could have a framework on how to do it in place. Good point. Frank: Got it, and concerning USDC, are we looking at doing another debt ceiling lift? Primoz: The plan is to reduce the debt ceiling on current stablecoin vaults to zero. In addition, reduce the PSM debt ceiling, which will initially include only USDC, has a debt ceiling of 500 million that was voted. Sam should comment on it, but the idea was to start with USDC. Then, next year, we would begin to including other stablecoins into PSM. If you want to create diversification, we would limit USDC and increase the debt ceiling. So we\u2019d force the diversification. Frank: Got it, thank you.    SamM PSM Implementation Update 26:12  We\u2019ve got a bit of a new situation this week in that there will be a community executive vote in addition to the regular Friday executive. I\u2019m going to be putting together the community-run executive. The idea is to deploy them simultaneously and have the portal list the Maker foundation\u2019s standard executive on Friday as usual. We wait until that one passes and add the PSM executive. Included in that PSM executive are changes to the debt ceiling. All the stablecoins except USDT and USDCb vault will be zero, and the PSM will be added with a 500 million debt ceiling. That\u2019s all good to go. Still waiting on the audit. Hopefully, it will be coming in today or tomorrow. All systems are a go as far as I can see. Any questions about this process?  Matthew Rabinowitz: Regarding procedure, how are you adding it to the voting portal? Sam: It\u2019ll be added just the same. We want to have the regular Friday executive pass first and then list the PSM executive. Whenever it passes, maybe Monday or something like that. Still, it\u2019s worth mentioning that we\u2019ll run it with a longer expiry because we plan to run it over the entire holiday break. We don\u2019t have any other executives coming in. We\u2019ll give it a bit longer time to pass because there may be fewer people\u2019s availability. I don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to pass, but that\u2019s the idea. Frank Cruz: We\u2019re going to need a push from the community, right? Because I don\u2019t see any VCs jumping in. What\u2019s the hat right now? Christopher: 63,000 is on the hat. Frank: So we\u2019re going to need like 63,000 community members. This is going to be good.    Amy Jung Community Development Team Update 29:36 898\u00d7534 42.6 KB  Charles and Guy will go through a little bit more high-level end-of-year review. However, I  just thought I would give a little fun positive note of activity. We had some great calls this year, such as the community collateral calls that Juan has been running. We have community calls that David and extended hosts have been running. And then, of course, these governance and risk calls. We also have the community that\u2019s been creating Maker Relays, which are summaries of all the different activities for governance to see. We have around six working groups if not more.  892\u00d7518 43.9 KB  This is the one that I really wanted to share with everybody\u2014forum activity. I think we use the forum due to the significant communication that goes in governance. Still, it\u2019s scarce that we actually see which activities are involved. Therefore, I did a little digging through and starting with how many likes. We had 25.900 total likes. Everyone\u2019s participating in posts that they\u2019re liking.  898\u00d7518 21 KB 890\u00d7518 68 KB  The total user daily visit: the number of users visiting every day, is a whopping 37k, which\u2019s up 582% from last year. The exciting thing is the new user sign-ups. We only had 484 last year, and this year we had 1700, which is up 350%.  876\u00d7522 80.8 KB  This is the most impressive one. We had 12000 new posts this year compared to 1500 last year. That is incredible growth as well as the number of new topics that were created.  890\u00d7518 78.3 KB  These are just some brief overviews. I\u2019ll be doing a wrap-up that I\u2019ll share in the forum. Thank you to everyone who\u2019s been contributing to the community members. Thanks to LongForWisdom, the governance facilitator for managing the forum\u2019s craziness as well and onward for next year, it\u2019s going to be great.  LongForWisdom: Thanks, Amy. I will just say those are slightly terrifying numbers from my perspective as the person who has to moderate the forum. If anybody\u2019s interested in forum moderation as a role going forward, let me know. But yeah, I think we\u2019ve definitely seen growth over the last year.    Juan Collateral Call Update 33:08  Yesterday, we had the last collateral call of the year. We did the wrap-up for real-world assets. I\u2019m going to post the link in the chat in a second. We basically had three asset originators, Harbour Trade Credit, People\u2019s company, and Fortunafi. The three of them are working with Centrifuge to bring real-world assets into the blockchain. It was quite interesting. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to explore each project in depth. Maybe we\u2019ll have to invite them next year to do a more specific session for each one of them. The YouTube video is already online; Amy posted it. Thanks for that. The other thing that I wanted to comment on was what Amy already said. I think we had around 30 projects presenting. Looking back, it was quite rewarding, to be honest. I wasn\u2019t expecting that when I started getting a little bit more involved in Maker. I think that people here are too smart and hence too humble to say it, so I guess that I\u2019ll have to say it; it\u2019s been a pleasure getting to know a lot of you more and seeing your work been really, really good. I\u2019m not going to start giving out names because there are a good 15 to 25 people that I\u2019ve been enjoying working with and seeing your point of view in different meetings. It\u2019s been great. Thank you for that. How\u2019s that for a speech, Long?  LongForWisdom: It was great. It was short, and I liked it. Brian makes a good point in the sidebar. Juan is most definitely one of those smart and humble people. Please do embarrass him with your congratulations and gratitude when you get a chance.    ",

It\u2019s been a fantastic year with a lot of progress. Before I get into the fun stats, I wanted to mention two new proposals in the conception phase. They will be transitioning into the RFC phase. Just making some comments on the proposals in terms of the formats and structure; The first one is MIP31, which is for active reserve based on the Uniswap V2 contract. Then there\u2019s MIP32, which is the PSM for Compound MIPs exposure. This proposal proposes to provide an extension for the PSM. The extension allows the PSM to leverage USDC via DAI using CD. It also converts this USDC to cUSD using the same joint adapter. These two proposals were proposed by Alexis.  3139\u00d71761 258 KB  We have 8 proposals in the request for comment phase, and I\u2019ve gone over them a few times already. Still, there are a few new ones that I have yet to mention. Those are the sub proposals for domain team onboarding for smart contracts. That is from SamM, which is really awesome to see. Additionally, an onboard risk proposal from SebVentures. We also have the proposal to onboard Juan as the domain support facilitator to work with Amy, who was onboarded during the last governance cycle. We have the governance communication declaration of intent; if it were to pass, it would display the intention of MakerDao to onboard. Or it would welcome a proposal from a governance communications domain team. Lastly, we have the Maker protocol cover with Nexus Mutual, which is also a declaration of intent. If that passes, MakerDao will welcome the proposal for Nexus Mutual to cover maker protocol.  3140\u00d71759 149 KB  The prenup discussions which are always being discussed are the Throttled Surplus Buffer, The Delegation of Authority, Real estate tokenization protocol, and the PSM based on cDAI.  3108\u00d71754 527 KB Charles St. Louis Collateral Onboarding Review 39:04 3136\u00d71760 295 KB  In terms of our collateral onboarding updates, we had three governance pools for collateral onboarding that all passed. The executive vote to onboard UNI and renBTC went live on December 11th and executed on December 14th, adding them to the Maker protocol. We have 5 collateral types awaiting the executive vote. That\u2019s the RWA-001, 6S, AAVE, Uniswap LPs for USDC, ETH, DAI-ETH, and PAXG. As the other domain teams mentioned, we will be seeing the executive onboard AAVE and UNI-V2-DAI-ETH LP token tomorrow. Lastly, we have the community green light polls for December published on Monday running until December 28th. This is for the DPI index, wrapped FileCoin, and wrapped Zcash. Go and vote and provide your input on those over the holidays.  3136\u00d71757 161 KB  I wanted to get into some stats about the progress we\u2019ve made over the last 7 months. This is pretty incredible, with two more to be added before the end of the year. It\u2019s been great to see all the involvement of every team throughout the year. We have seen 78 MIP6 applications for collateral onboarding. Since launch in May, we\u2019ve seen 33 MIPs proposed with 20 of them accepted. 44 sub proposals came through with 37 of them accepted and some in progress. At the very least, decentralization is hot right now. I\u2019ve been speaking to many community members, and the forums are as active as ever. We\u2019re going to have a really great 2021. So with that, I just wanted to leave it in a happy holiday. Thank you, everyone, for the great work.  Guy MakerDAO Year in Review 42:30  I\u2019m Guy Brandon. I work with the Marcoms team. I came on to the team at the beginning of the year. I mainly work on blogs at the moment. I dropped a link to our annual review. I\u2019m going to give some edited highlights of developments. Only a few things are of interest to the Maker ecosystem. It\u2019s been a rough year, but it was a whole rubicon year for crypto and DeFi. Arguably, MakerDAO was the largest beneficiary of that. At the beginning of the year, multi collateral DAI was a little over 6 weeks old. Within about 3 weeks, the amount of DAI had reached the 100 million mark. That changed dramatically later in the year. We know that DeFi has been a massive driver of DAI adoption but what we\u2019ve also seen is DAI finding its niche in various different sectors. You can look at the blog post about DAI gaming initiative, which launched in March. One of the critical use cases that we\u2019ve identified is that DAI is a very attractive currency for gamers for various reasons. We\u2019ve also seen DAI gain traction in the NFT space, which is growing really fast at the moment. This includes a lot of digital arts and other collectibles. It\u2019s carving out a role as a currency for the digital art and culture market, which is really cool. Coronavirus pandemic caused very heavy volatility across the global markets in March, including crypto. That market downturn served to prompt several community discussions around various improvements to the Maker protocol, which have come about in the following months and will continue. There have been a few immediate and medium-term changes. The liquidation system is one of the big ones. We saw liquidations 1.2 launched in September. In the context of major upgrades, I think we can also include the DS Chief upgrade which we saw very recently mitigate the risks of flash voting. It\u2019s also worth mentioning the voting portal upgrade, which has made it a lot easier for people to vote. Throughout the year, this process of decentralization that was already well underway has continued and accelerated. At the end of March, there was the transfer of MKR token control to Governance. A major action was the approval of the MIPS framework in April. This was massive step forward for decentralization. I think some of the things that people have shared shows that confidence was not misplaced. The community has been entirely responsible for changes to the protocol since. June was when DeFi adoption really started to accelerate. Then July saw that spill over to the Maker protocol, and that\u2019s when we saw total value locked and DAI generation really take off. TVL and DeFi have increased by 2000% this year. A significant milestone for DAI was reached 5 weeks ago when the amount of DAI reached 1 billion, which is a pretty cool milestone. Check out that infographic on the blog if you haven\u2019t already. It\u2019s well worth mentioning that ETH 2.0 has officially launched a few weeks back. That is going to be a very long process to complete the set of upgrades to that network. but that will have pretty huge implications for ETH, Maker, and DeFi as a whole. The last thing worth mentioning is that Tomorrow\u2019s vote around real-world assets is an unprecedented and breakthrough development. A few key stats, thank you, Amy, for yours; these are just some edited highlights. Roughly this time last year, we\u2019ve seen the DAI supply increase about 15 times. We have 9 times more collateral types. There was a mistake on the blog, which will be updated because we finalized that text before the last text was approved. TVL is up almost 8 times. We have 6 times the number of vaults. The last one is the number of integrations has nearly tripled. It has been a pretty impressive year.  LongForWisdom: Thank you, Guy; quick correction, the real-world assets spell is being pushed to January. That brings us to the end of our scheduled agenda. Any questions?    Open Discussion tUSD Acquisition 49:40  LongForWisdom: Maybe we can discuss tUSD a little bit. I know that\u2019s been a hot topic on the forum recently. To give us an overview of what we\u2019re talking about. A couple of days ago, Shane posted a thread relating to an announcement from the tUSD team talking about how they have been acquired by another group and would be running it. They\u2019re going to continue running tUSD, but they will have different owners. The CEO left a comment in the forum reassuring users that there wouldn\u2019t be any profound changes. Any thoughts for discussion?  Christopher Mooney: Has anyone figured out who the Asian consortium is at this point? Gregory Di Prisco: It\u2019s Tron; they just use that as a cover. LongForWisdom: It\u2019s not entirely clear, but there was a similar language used when the same consortium acquired Poloniex, which did increase Tron related content on that site.   SamM: If we want to take the route of unwinding exposure, there are two ways to do that. We could wait for liquidations 2.0 and turn them on. That could work. Another alternative is to liquidate the current tUSD vault into the tUSD PSM when we add that in and then maybe set the out fee to 0% to clear it out as fast as possible.  Christopher: I think it would still stay on the books. There\u2019s probably an alternative liquidation where we create a custom liquidator that can be called. It gets the collateral that the liquidator then cycles on the market for something like USDC, gUSD or PAX-USD and then puts that into the PSM. Thereby getting the DAI back and paying the position. If we would do that, then whatever delta exists on the market for those pairs will be accrued as a loss. It\u2019s going into the collateral buffer or the system surplus buffer. Those are options. LongForWisdom: Any option that involves liquidation potentially upsets a subset of users. Although we assume that those vaults have been abandoned, there\u2019s a good chance that some of them haven\u2019t, right? Especially now that the stability fees are 0%. There\u2019s a good chance that some of the creators of those vaults are just holding them. Gregory Di Prisco: Is it possible to turn on stability fees so that the large ones are under 101% at least? Christopher: Almost the entire thing. It\u2019s as though 51 million tUSD is already underneath the collateralization ratio. Almost the whole lot can be liquidated. Gregory: Those users wouldn\u2019t have much reason to be upset. LongForWisdom: Well, they may because they knew there were liquidations enabled when they set up the vaults. Maybe it would be fine, but I would expect someone to be annoyed. SamM: We definitely need to give fair warning about that, but I mean, we are going to need to introduce a stick to these vault holders at some point; otherwise, they\u2019ll just hold at 0% fees indefinitely and get a no-risk short position on DAI. BrianMcMichael: There\u2019s no economic reason to come back for that anyways unless they buy DAI for a low price, which we haven\u2019t seen in months. Christopher: In general, we should give a fair amount of warning and create a custom liquidator in the next year that lets people know that okay, this is going to start liquidating people, and as it liquidates them, it moves those positions over into the PSM. They can top up or pay their positions down if they need to. I think that\u2019s the right approach. It lets them keep their short position if they want. Otherwise, they have to pay it back.   Lev: Since we\u2019re doing so much for the stable coins, it would be very useful to have a flipper module that sells stuff at a DS value over a private price that we could swap into situations like this where governance would say they\u2019re happy to get rid of the tUSD or on 1 basis point below the dollar. Thereafter, you can put that on and see how long it takes to clear. It\u2019s basically a PSM for liquidations, and it would be simple to implement.  LongForWisdom: Yeah, that\u2019s a good point.   Primoz: No need to rush today, but we need a plan. There may still be some unwinding. I\u2019m just looking at the vaults, and 10 million vaults are positive. If they unwind when PSM is enabled, there should be a small profit. Maybe we see some unwinding. I think that if someone starts blacklisting tUSD at Maker tomorrow, the whole acquisition becomes worthless. Still, of course, if something wrong happens, we need a plan before it happens. Suppose we need to wait for liquidations 2.0. In that case, I think we can focus on the one Lev proposed where we adjust the flipper and set some sort of price to measure the cost for Maker. The benefit will be higher because those vaults have some additional value of over 100%. The PSM idea makes sense to me.  LongForWisdom: It\u2019s worth mentioning that no one necessarily decided that we need to get rid of tUSD right? That\u2019s the whole debate. Juan: It\u2019s good to speak about a plan for any collateral type we may have in the future. We need to make sure that we have a decent plan, including communicating to the vault holders. Preparing for any emergency doesn\u2019t mean we need to pull the trigger after we know the plan. LongForWisdom: Good point.   brianmcmichael: Regulators are going to push even harder in 2021 and beyond. Stablecoins can potentially provide an existential risk to the protocol because of the blacklist risk. A lot of people think that won\u2019t happen. Still, there are talks in the process that it might.  LongForWisdom: Good perspective there. We need to have some sort of plan in place to deal with stablecoin related issues.   Joe Quintilian: Just an idea. At some point while we transition to the full DAO here, perhaps somebody can come up with a MIP where we have a governance relations person that works for the DAO. That way, we\u2019re included in the conversation with USDC, PAX and everyone else.  Juan: You looking for a job, Joe? Joe Quintilian: I have enough already, but that\u2019s just an excellent point that\u2019s been brought up. Juan: We need to have a plan or at least some guidelines that we know there, and we can follow when it happens. Brian has a great point. Joe Quintilian: I still think they\u2019re going to be worked out. I think we\u2019ll see an explosion of growth with stablecoins next year. Our most significant role is managing the risk. Yesterday on CNBC, Glen Hutchins, the former head of the NY Federal Reserve, came out and said stablecoins are exploding and will continue to do so. LongForWisdom: Thanks, Joe. You\u2019re always welcome to comment.   Gregory Di Prisco: I want to point out that there\u2019s a potential alternative to taking on stablecoins to maintain the peg, which is to set up a structure as Matt has with MIP21. To have a trust where we can potentially send DAI with the express intent of that trust selling DAI and holding dollars in a bank account. At least that way, the beneficiary of that trust is the Maker holders, and there\u2019s no blacklist risk.  Sebastian: You could be blacklisted by the government. Gregory De Prisco: They would have to go through the judicial system to freeze them. They couldn\u2019t just click a button. Mathew Rabinowitz: The issue with stablecoins is that Circle has the sole and absolute authority to do it by themselves at their discretion. People have recourse if they do that. But it is up to them if they decide to do that. Something like that could work, but the challenge is that the deposits are only secured up to a certain amount with the FDIC. The next follow on is if that account has an investment and adviser. You were allowed to buy U.S. treasuries with it. Now you\u2019ve taken it one step further where it\u2019s backed by treasuries at this point, which is the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. brianmcmichael: Uniswap LP tokens are going to help a lot. We can put tokens in USDC and USDT pairs, and they\u2019re both black-listable on their own. It\u2019s possible that the Uniswap exchange could get blacklisted. However, we can still extricate the tokens from our system, and they\u2019ll be dealt with in the greater DeFi ecosystem. There is a lot of access to liquidity there, which is a lot safer for the protocol.   SamM: I see a trend as protocols keep building on top of each other. This blacklist is going to turn into you blacklist all of DeFi and less of blacklisting specific addresses. Circle will probably not want to ax all DeFi USDC. We either go down together or we don\u2019t. That would be a death sentence for their currency.  Mathew Rabinowitz: They\u2019ve already done it once or twice under totally justified circumstances, and there are mechanisms to help offset stablecoins. One of the benefits of doing the PSM model, in general, is that we\u2019re going to know this is how much we need to displace continuously and with precision. SamM: Yes. Christopher: It\u2019s actually my favorite aspect of the PSM. LongForWisdom: It\u2019s something I think is really cool as well.   Christopher: We have moved off from the original topic, but does anyone have other opinions about tUSD, its change of ownership, and possibly whether Justin Sun and Tron are in control of it?  Juan: I think Greg brought up excellent points in the forum about the custody of the tUSD changing and then if the blacklisting function will go towards the so-called consortium. The date is what should give us a sense of urgency or not. Regardless, we should work towards something, but the urgency is not clear right now. Christopher: So we don\u2019t have a date yet? LongForWisdom: No, the CEO said several weeks. I asked him to be more specific, but we may not get an answer.   brianmcmichael: Maker is a risk protocol, right? Every token that we take on gives us some amount of risk, and the idea is that we offset that with the stability fees. That\u2019s the insurance premium, right? We might decide the risk premium for tUSD is too high for anyone to actually use it, and then at that point, we may have to delist it. I don\u2019t think we should completely throw it out. We just need to manage the risk now that it has changed.  LongForWisdom: Yeah, that\u2019s a way of putting it. Matthew Rabinowitz: If we just take the central bank\u2019s corollary to a banking model, banks cannot change hands without receiving consent from a central bank. In this context, it happened without consent. By looking at the numbers, a party could decide to mint DAI based on it. I agree with what you just said about the risk parameters and the risk premium associated. Still, in parallel to that, my personal vote would be to lower the debt ceiling immediately to inhibit taking on additional risk until we quantify that in parallel to raising stability fees. If the tUSD that\u2019s outstanding is potentially already underwater. It\u2019s more about limiting the damage as much as possible. Sam: The debt ceiling is going to zero in the PSM vote. LongForWisdom: On their list, it would be Friday, but potentially maybe Monday or Tuesday. Matthew: That\u2019s making the assumption that those things pass in sequence. LongForWisdom: Yes, you\u2019re right. that is not guaranteed, obviously.   Frank Cruz: With regards to the consortium of tUSD, would it be a vote of confidence if a16z stays on board? Speaking of a16z, Horowitz got named to the Coinbase board of directors. I think that is a vote of confidence for DAI, in my opinion. Just wondering what you guys think of that if they stay with the consortium. I know they invested in tUSD. What is their thinking behind going to Tron? It would be nice to know are they doing it because they don\u2019t see the scalability in Ethereum. They want to go to Tron, and maybe they\u2019ll go to Algorand next. These are questions that we just don\u2019t know yet.  Lucas Vogelsang: I don\u2019t know about tUSD, but a lot of the other US Dollar backed stable coins are shipping versions of their token on every blockchain out there. I think the change of ownership is more of just them doing a token for Tron and seeing how others act. I know quite a few other token projects in the Polkadot ecosystem and so on. Frank Cruz: Lucas, in your opinion, if a16z sold their stake in tUSD, How do you view that? Lucas Vogelsang: I wouldn\u2019t weigh it that much, to be honest, because most of these VC funds don\u2019t actively manage their portfolio. Certainly, if they write off a project, they won\u2019t care about trying to sell it. Of course, maybe they would but not because a particular VC fund sells or doesn\u2019t sell. They\u2019ve made a bunch of other bad investments. I think that\u2019s not a vote of confidence.   LongForWisdom: Cool, alright, if no one has anything else to add, we\u2019ll end the call here. There will be no meeting next week.

Welcome to the MakerDAO Scientific Governance and Risk Meeting number 109, taking place of September the 10th at 16:00 UTC. My name is LongforWisdom, I\u2019m the MakerDAO governance facilitator and I\u2019m joined currently by 36 people. The agenda for today is a little bit lighter than usual but we\u2019ve got some discussion points. Feel free to interrupt if you have something to say.   Discussions happen in the Forum.   Domain Team Updates Will Barnes Smart Contracts Team Update 01:42  Just a few things changed in terms of risk parameters this week. The Base rate will remain unchanged this week at 2% and TBTC will be whitelisted on the ETH/BTC Oracle. There is an ongoing signal request to increase the USDC-A debt ceiling on the forum. The result of this will be included in tomorrow\u2019s executive. In terms of MIPs, we\u2019ll discuss later. Dark Spell is in a formal submission. We have a proposal to onboard the four members of the smart contracts domain team: Lucas, Brian, Chris, and myself that was submitted yesterday. And last week a proposal to off-board Mariano MIP7c4. And that\u2019s all I have unless anyone wants to add. There\u2019s something to discuss the hold up in collateral types that will be discussed later. But that\u2019s it.  Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 03:20   Nik: Kind of brief this week. We had a whitelisting proposal this week to whitelist TBTC on the ETH-BTC Oracle. They were already whitelisted before on their previous deployment. They had a bug and they went back and fixed it. So this was more of a swap between their old and new address. Still, surprising to see one voter with 500 MKR voting against it. Even more surprising to see their voting history, they voted on the first poll to whitelist them in the first place. Not sure what\u2019s going on but maybe they want to bring that up in the forum   The much more important issue is that last week we deprecated the Oracle V1 contracts. These were the ones used in Single Collateral DAI. We shut down Single Collateral DAI and warned people that after a healthy amount of time after it got shut down we will be shutting the Oracles down as well. We gave people over six months as a heads up and had confirmation from multiple people that they are fine. Other people didn\u2019t respond for a few months. And low and behold, we have our first casualties. OPYN sold put options against ETH that don\u2019t expire until June 2021 and they have no way of changing which Oracle these are pointed to. If they can\u2019t use Oracle v1 Medianizer, they\u2019re screwed. I discussed with them what the options are and what if we were to whitelist Oracle V1 on our current Oracles. Then anyone could poke the V1 contract. Then anyone could pay the gas price, call the function to update the price on V1 contract and V1 contract will just read from V2 Oracle. It\u2019s a little bit controversial because part of us selling Oracle as a service. If people want to use our data they have to get whitelisted versus this which lets people go around that. If anyone can call this function, and it\u2019s not something we can change because the contract has been deployed, means that anyone willing to pay the gas price can get the price anyway. That\u2019s something the community needs to weigh. I think it\u2019s more of a PR issue because we don\u2019t want to be the ones to let another protocol hang out to dry. And if it\u2019s until June we can see this as a PR move.   Last week\u2019s executive proposal went through. MyCrypto and Argent are light feeds that are supplying prices to the Oracles.   LongForWisdom: If we do whitelist the V1 Oracles, we can up-whitelist them again fairly easily in case things go bad?   Nik: That\u2019s correct. Once those options expire in June we can un-whitelist them and in the meanwhile monitor blockchain data on how many people are using that V1 Oracle. If we see a big spike in usage, we know it\u2019s parasitic behavior and we\u2019ll know who those people are.   Sam MacPherson: Do they need the Oracle the whole time or would it be sufficient to get access to the Oracle for June?   Nik: They need it the whole time because options are collateralized and can get liquidated if the price drops low enough on the underlying. They posted a proposal in the Oracle section in the forum, you can ask them more specifics there.     Primoz Risk Team Update 09:34   This week we published 2 collateral risk evaluations. One was posted by our independent analyst, Will, for LINK. We posted one for COMP. There was also another for Loopring, which didn\u2019t pass. Will suggested a 5M DC, 2% RP, and 175 LR as the risk parameters for LINK.  I commented that these risk parameters are conservative. The analysis shows that LINK is very liquid especially compared to other assets we\u2019ve looked at in the past. If you look at yEarn vaults there is a possibility they may use LINK in one of them using Maker for their strategy. We could go higher, I think it\u2019s fairly safe, but that\u2019s up to governance. We can lower the debt ceiling initially and then increase in time based on behavior and risk exposure.    A seven million DC for COMP is fairly liquid. What\u2019s particularly good is the DEX volume which bodes well for liquidations. 3% RP LR 175.   Marko and I published research for cUSD and cDAI. I suggest checking it out. It\u2019s interesting to model the DAI price effects from those assets. The main strategy now in Compound is to recycle DAI, but enabling cUSDC is a more interesting strategy where people re-leverage through Maker vaults, achieve nice yields, and push DAI price down.   We\u2019re also focusing on a different rate-setting approach which I wrote about in the past coming up with solutions that benefit governance, make it more agile and less complex. There are inconsistencies with how we set rates and apply RPs.   We\u2019re going to apply some tests so we can better understand the vault actions.  My idea to have more community participation in the risk related organization as well as understand the current risk exposure of vaults. We\u2019d ideally want to know what users are doing with DAI before we\u2019re setting rates. I\u2019ll provide tests and ask for feedback if there is an opportunity to help us out and possibly become a contributor to the risk team, which is currently understaffed.   Lastly, there were two posts initiated this week:   Lowering auction box 50 and potentially lowering ttl, this opens for on-chain vote beginning September 14th.   Signal for DC on USDC-A vault we\u2019ve seen more minting because DAI price is trending higher. Today we\u2019ve seen a couple of strategies for minting DAI through USDC and getting better yields. Ideally, we\u2019d want to diversify from USDC to other stable coins and we wanted to see the USDT and PAX demand. Not sure how interesting those newly launched vaults are for arbitrageurs, it makes more sense to increase USDC DC. If this passes, it goes into the September 11th executive.     Governance LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 15:22   Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread: If you have the time to read over and vote in the active threads, that would be much appreciated.  Discussions   Discussion - MakerDAO in 5 years  SebVentures discussing different changes in the DeFi ecosystem and MakerDAO\u2019s role in it.    Working Group: Autonomous MakerDAO   LongForWisdom introduces a largely community working group making an effort to push the decentralization of MakerDAO.   The autonomous MakerDAO working group, which is working on pushing the DAO more towards decentralization.   We\u2019re focusing on the responsibilities of a facilitator and getting sign off on that from governance. We are also improving to tidy up the MIPs process and make it more streamlined while working on the Governance cycle.     Signal Requests   Should we increase USDC-A debt ceiling?  Primoz proposes an urgent signal request to raise the USDC-A debt ceiling. Will be included in the executive on Friday, September 11th.    Should we change box & ttl auction parameters?   Primoz posts a signal to gather input on the box and ttl parameter.   Semi-urgent poll which ended on Friday, September 11th.

Forum Navigation Index  An index that aims to make navigation and browsing easier around the forum.    Practical Guide to the Signaling Process  LongForWisdom writes an updated guide to the signaling process, highlighting conventions to follow.    MIPs Charles St. Louis Weekly MIPs Update 19:00 Intro1423\u00d7801 126 KB Weekly Activity992\u00d7543 152 KB Collateral Onboarding Updates975\u00d7527 158 KB Proposal in the RFC Phase970\u00d7523 230 KB   Would like to highlight a few of these:   MIP13c3-SP4- Declaration of Intent for off-chain Real-World-Asset collateral onboarding for DAI.   MIP 22 Collateral Onboarding for Centrifuge.   MIP 23 Domain Teams and Their Roles in Those Teams.        Offboarding of Mariano and Cyrus.   Wil Barnes, Lucas, Chris Mooney, and Brian from Smart contracts will be onboarding.   Risk Domain Team onboarding is for Primoz.   Rich\u2019s offboarding didn\u2019t pass and it\u2019s worth noting a process improvement. I believe this should change so mandated actors should be able to offboard themselves voluntarily, to not go through Governance. The caveat is communication to the community in the forum or as a sub proposal. I have an action item for MIP0 and MIP7 to change for offboarding.   917\u00d7502 87.6 KB Dai Flash Mint with Sam 25:52   The Flash mint module is a request for the Smart contracts team for building, approved ideally via Governance. What is does is allow DAI minting for arb opportunities for what they want. As long as it\u2019s returned with a fee they get to keep the excess similar to flash loans.   Improves market efficiency   Democratized of arbitrage   Security exploits found quicker, making DeFi stronger   A fee provides as an income source   DC required     I got a little bit of feedback and it\u2019s in the final phase. Additionally, I wrote an initial implementation for no UI but should be easy to add.   Brian McMichael: expect a PR with tips and comments to help usher it towards production-ready.   Sam: Thanks!   Akiva: Speaking of feedback, if anyone has comments on why they didn\u2019t vote for forward guidance, message me and we can fix the proposal to improve it in cycle moving forward.     Collateral Onboarding 29:00   Matthew R: Quick plug for RWA and onboarding credit tenant leases as collateral for DAI.   LongForWisdom: Good point. I should give Juan a chance to talk about it.   Juan: Yesterday we had a collateral onboarding call with one inch and trust token. Next week Lucas and Matthew from 6s capital to discuss real-world assets. Sept 16. Agenda in the forums. Then Stani from Aave and Tyler Winklevoss from Gemini. Join us.   Lucas Vogelsang: Quick on MIP13-c3-SP 5. or, in English, a declaration to onboard centrifuge assets. The backstory is since MCD went live we\u2019ve had 4 MIP6 that were greenlit by the community. We\u2019ve been working with the community to address liquidations, DC, SF, and how we build contracts, how they interact. Now we believe it feasible to properly onboard them. The DOI outlines guidelines for developing this process. They function slightly differently than vanilla ERC-20 tokens in MCD. This MIP is a predecessor for a MIP and eventual executive to see how we can work with domain teams. Centrifuge is happy to step in and handle that work as much as possible.   MIPs submission review   Nine proposals were submitted for September. All of them are fine. I agree with Charles that offboarding voluntarily is better, voting on it is not effective for Maker. Happy for Charles to deal with that outside of governance.   Everything else goes to inclusion on Monday.   ",

There was tremendous liquidity in the market at the time.   As ETH price fell and we saw liquidations or unwind on different platforms, we saw drying up of liquidity in the moment.   As certain positions unwound, more Dai was on the open market. A huge chunk of the trades that occurred last week was on Uniswap.    VWAP913\u00d7447 61.1 KB   Proportionally Uniswap of volume versus oasis and DYDX which typically dominate a larger part of the volume.   USDC price924\u00d7365 94.5 KB   A large chunk here of DAI<>USDC price is on Curve. We saw a price run up to 1.02 1.03.   USD price924\u00d7365 94.5 KB   DAI<>USD echoes that with a fair amount of variability on price.   USDT price918\u00d7371 132 KB   DAI<>USDT is very similar to USDC.   Dai Stats915\u00d7423 110 KB   Supply is at ~430 million DAI. 340 from ETH. 3.4 from BAT. 40 million USDC-A. 47 mill from WBTC. smaller amounts from other collateral types.   USDC-A supply913\u00d7435 39.8 KB   USDC-A low utilization for the better part of the month. in the past few days, it shot to 40 million.   WBTC Supply913\u00d7435 39.8 KB   WBTC was steady at 80 million but over the last few days as it went > 60 > 47 million. Many positions were cleared out.   ETH-A supply905\u00d7432 35.8 KB    We saw a trend for ETH-A supply trending up and then run down to clear out. What was going on? a few things:   ETH price dropped, some liquidations, but they were small. Compared to 80 million or so clearing out over three days.   Much of that move wasn\u2019t liquidation it was refinancing or unwinding.   Repayments of DAI brought the supply down.      yETH vaults905\u00d7432 35.8 KB   17 million in yETH Vault pools.   Curve Dai735\u00d7402 55.1 KB   32 million DAI in Curve deposits.    About 140 million excess supply in Compound.   yETH example-large unwinding vault720\u00d7343 49.8 KB   Large holders, 70 million in the SushiSwap liquidity pool. 37 million in the Uniswap pool. 13.6 million in Balancer, 13.1 million in Curve. Smaller amounts are in known smart contracts.   815\u00d7394 110 KB   Thread here is a large quantity of movement out of Uniswap into SushiSwap liquidity pool. In addition, a fair amount of repayments on platforms such as COMP are undergoing farming where people were supplying excess DAI.   778\u00d7439 100 KB    This is an example of a large vault with yETH positions. On the 4th, there was a series of repayments in 2.5 million DAI each, unwinding to a safer CR. We\u2019ve seen yEarn\u2019s halt in deposits and mintings after which was paused and rounded down. This contributed to a reduction in supply minted from ETH.   1678\u00d7662 221 KB   All in all that was trading volume and liquidity for DAI drying up. You see a lot of the movements counteracted on price impact. But on something like the USDC pair, it\u2019s not the same phenomenon. So prices went up a bit. But again, you can tie that back to liquidity drying up and DAI supply going down.   Farm Opportunities 42:23   Kiarahs: It looks like the move is farming driven but if anyone wants to expand on that I would appreciate it.   Vishesh: Given the SF value, it\u2019s more likely for native asset price and farming yields to be driving. Liquidations as well. Decreased apps for farming yields all contribute to the movement of DAI supply minting and collateral locked as well as SFs. By and large, people are more concerned with liquidation and losing access to large yields. I think that drives the decision process more so than I pay 2% more per year for holding positions.   Primoz: Marko did an analysis of unwinding those vaults migrated to Aave borrowed USDC and farmed Sushi. If SF had an impact? I think not because borrowing on Aave is 4%. It\u2019s a farming yield versus increased SF when considering having an effect.    Open Discussion  Liquidation 45:20   Primoz: There was a poll a month ago in support of lower LR for ETH, which would be on ETH-B vault with intention of charging fees and increasing DAI supply via opening new vaults or attracting existing users to mint more DAI. The RP debt ceiling wasn\u2019t voted on and the final vote leads the risk team to bring this up for discussion. If we include lower LR for ETH-B vault, we\u2019ll be able to charge more money but potentially have more risk because of lower CR. We need a consensus for what\u2019s the longer-term strategy. ETH-A vaults are using DAI to farm it and will be interesting to move toward ETH-B. If we lower LR to 130, they\u2019ll be able to mint more DAI and boost yields over 50%. When assessing risk on DC, with lower CR there is a higher probability of losses. With low LR, there are OSM risks. If ETH drops rapidly, people could dump ETH on MRK on the lowest LR using vault OSM price and they would mint as much DAI as they could, thereby making an instant profit. I want to highlight that whatever DC we choose, we need to be utilizing it as much as possible to minimize OSM risk. I propose starting with lower DC and increasing it and always utilizing it as much as possible. We can calculate RP similar to ETH-A. The calculation might be biased because it\u2019s hard to assess OSM risk, so governance might want to charge higher rates. We should test how rate-sensitive our users are to have more feedback. Going forward we intend to address all of this in a post. The ETH-B vault will be heavily utilized because it\u2019s good for yield farmers.   Matthew Rabinowitz: Is it possible that if someone issues DAI in the previous hour we can have LR to be high to offset that OSM risk.   Will B: It would be quick difficult to do that.   Brian M: It would involve changing some core contracts. We could consider it in Liquidations 2.0. We\u2019ll have a different pattern in a few months.   Matthew: An idea is to have a severe penalty if we see someone with an intent to exploit the system.   Nik: It\u2019s exploring the discrepancy in price if ETH drops suddenly by 20% but the current price hasn\u2019t updated. You could borrow more DAI than your ETH is worth. The exploiter isn\u2019t expecting to get any of their collateral back.   Kurt: For these situations, we have an upper limit of DAI required to cover outstanding auctions, so there\u2019s a ceiling on how much can be liquidated at once. It at least limits how damaging it is to the system.    Real-World Assets and How the Teams Prioritize Onboarding Collateral Types 56:20   Matthew R: This is Matt from 6s Capital and we\u2019re putting forward a declaration of intent to bring on real-world assets. We\u2019re putting together a scalable legally compliant way to bring on credit tenant commercial leases where we know the credit behind it is using the same mechanism used today for putting today\u2019s statutory trusts.   LongForWisdom: I think the intention is to have a discussion on why RWA hasn\u2019t been implemented yet and how the teams are prioritizing the collateral onboarding process.   Planet_X: I\u2019ve been noticing that we\u2019re greenlighting many collateral types but the actual implementation is lacking. Where is the domain work for the collateral? What is holding up the process on the domain side?   Nik: There are 3 domain teams right now, almost all are foundation employees and collateral onboarding isn\u2019t our only job. Collateral onboarding and governance takes a significant amount of time but not our only job. There\u2019s a lot of things the team is working on so it\u2019s limited by domain teams bandwidth. If we want to onboard more collateral, we need to have more domain teams. I talked about our methodology in the forum for evaluating what work do we want to do next. Before that post, there was a lack of transparency. The factors we take into account are: how much DAI can be generated from a given collateral type? How difficult is it to onboard it?   Chris_p: We ask why this isn\u2019t getting done sooner and your answer is \u201cI work for the foundation.\u201d   Nik: Given our limited input we have to prioritize what collateral can we onboard that will generate the maximum amount of DAI supply? The community greenlit a lot of security & LP tokens but compared to vanilla tokens, the work required to onboard them is significantly higher with DAI supply potential being unclear. We have to prioritize low hanging fruit like LINK, that are highly liquid and we can expect similar pay off to other tokens we\u2019ve onboarded. Whereas security tokens can take three months to onboard. These are tradeoffs we have to make.   Lucas Vo: KNC, ZRX, MANA generated 500,000 DAI in debt, it will take a hundred more of these to generate 50 million. RWA can generate new DAI and add diversified uncorrelated DAI that has many other advantages. How can we as a community move forward if we just keep taking small familiar steps?   Nik: I agree that KNC, ZRX, MANA were kind of flops but the work to add them was very little. We\u2019re not saying we won\u2019t add security LP tokens but we\u2019re focusing on the reasoning behind adding them. If we went through the top ERC20 tokens, we can add all the low hanging fruit by November, and then we can look at adding LP and security tokens as things slow down by the end of the year.   Lev: The way to frame it is not asking why is there a pile-up of greenlit collateral types that haven\u2019t been assessed by risk teams but rather should we have a discussion about priorities and making sure we\u2019re making the most efficient use of domain team resources. In the near future, it will always be easier to add mid-market cap ERC20 tokens. It will continue being low hanging fruit forever. Eventually, we\u2019ll need to bite the bullet and look towards other potentially much more scalable collateral types. There\u2019s a lot more to do there but maybe it\u2019s time to raise other priorities and when is the right time to start looking at these other collateral types. When we needed emergency action to fix the DAI peg, it invigorated a lot of activity around adding new collateral types, like WBTC, which turned out to be a success. Can we do a similar kind of initiative to kick start adding real-world assets and raise those priorities?   Nik: I agree and its all a balancing act of short versus long term prioritization.   Will R: Another consideration for RWA is we have to adapt other practices like the risk framework. We\u2019ll need to consider how we will assess risk premiums, sources of information, OSM. It will take time and effort that goes into adaptation to RWA and we have some ideas that I\u2019ll bring to the table from working in banking for a long time. Data sources and properly assessing the risk will be important.   Lucas Vo:  Centrifuge has been working with Maker for a while and I propose moving forward with collateral onboarding on a small scale with reduced complexity. The same way as Single Collateral DAI was launched with a small debt ceiling with one asset and we spent years managing ETH as a collateral type. We can learn a lot by taking these small steps and do it at a safe scale as the core of MIP13 declaration of intent which I\u2019d love feedback on and to solidify with everyone.   Will R: Sounds good. Most important is capturing data as soon as possible so we work with real data rather than theoretical and we can measure expectations. Start conservative and scale accordingly.   Lucas Vo: We talked to credit people in the traditional financial world and onboarding RWA will give access to collateral types that are several times the size of our current DAI supply. If we figure out how to do this safely we won\u2019t have an issue with DAI supply. We\u2019ll have plenty of borrowers willing to pay SF generating us revenue and allowing us to bring back the DSR and normalizing the system. the peg is broken at the moment and adding this baseline of a stable supply of DAI will drastically change DAI market because of diverse collateral types.   Planet_X: Is this a feasible solution? Is possible to fast-track Centrifuge collateral with a low debt ceiling and see how it plays out?   Nik: We could find a way to onboard centrifuge security token if we\u2019re not onboarding any other collateral types.   Primoz: We could fast-track it and use a general risk model for crypto assets. If we have the infrastructure in place to monitor current exposure, particularly liquidation infrastructure. But one risk with this collateral type is legal. We have 3 domain teams now and it wasn\u2019t discussed who would cover the legal risk.   Will R: Yeah I can cover that, we discussed the initial proposal. At the moment there\u2019s a legal team at the foundation. The feedback is that the risk team would assume that that legal work would be done but the legal team but I\u2019m not sure at the moment.   Lucas Vo: We\u2019ve been working a lot on this topic and out how to do this. We\u2019ve been working with lawyers and I outlined how to do liquidations without having a sale of securities within Maker. More info will be on the forum. To address that it would require 3 months of work, I hope that it will not put a hold on smart contract or domain work to move these assets forward.   Mathew: I agree. The community needs to weigh the maximum impact of bringing DAI to the market knowing that RWA teams have spent a lot of time and effort preparing for this process.   Lev: In light of this discussion on priorities, should we have a signal request on this?   LongForWisdom: I think that would be a reasonable use of a signal request process.   Amy:  We are just lacking the staff needed to work on this. There are grants available if anyone is interested in doing this work. Please do reach out because we\u2019ve been looking across the community for more help.   LongForWisdom: I look forward to a discussion on the forum, thanks to everyone for coming.

Welcome to the MakerDAO scientific Governance and Risk meeting number 112, taking place on Thursday, October 1st at 16:00 UTC, same time every week. My name is LongForWisdom. I am the MakerDAO\u2019s Governance facilitator, for those that do not know.   Let us go through the general rules of the meeting: anyone is free to interrupt and make comments if they want to. Feel free to do that, and if it becomes a problem, I will let you know.   Discussions happen in the Forum.   Weekly Updates LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 01:35   Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread: If you have the time to read over and vote in the active threads, that would be much appreciated.   Looking at the forum this week. There had been a couple of good discussions and a couple of good signals.   We have had a discussion that\u2019s been going on for a couple of weeks by Derek, which will have some new discussion added onto it. Derek provided an update on using snapshots to improve signaling and pools, which prompted a little discussion.   We had a thread about theorizing around the legal structures of MakerDAO from sub ventures, discussing some of the various legal structures that could be put in place to manage a DAO. And then we also had an informed poll and some discussion around what rate-setting version two would look like from Hexonaut.   There have been some discussions in terms of seeking consensus for signal requests. We have had one from Aaron Bartsch for increasing the system surplus buffer, so this is the buffer that accrues Dai stability fees. It is a fair and well discussion, given that it controls whether we start burning MKR or we delay burning MKR or whether we burn some MKR and then stop again later on as we increase the buffer. Aaron has also proposed an ETH-B Vault collateral type, trying to crowdsource some of the initial parameters using forum polls following the rate and risk team\u2019s presentation on ETH-B. There is a full signal request up for the rates V2 proposal from Hexonaut which goes into details of what we are proposing for rates V2 and figuring out how to manage setting rates on all of these Vault types going forwards.   I am trying to make some minor changes to the forum, probably next week, in terms of switching categories around a little bit to hopefully make it easier to read and keep track of what is going on. So keep a lookout for that. It is not groundbreaking changes. It should be more about cleaning old categories that do not work and maybe adding a couple for signal requests and some stuff that could be separated from Governance because that category is getting big.   Discussions   Using Snapshot to Improve Signaling and Polls  Derek provides an update on using snapshot to improve our governance process which prompts further discussion.    Legal structures of MakerDAO  SebVentures opens a discussion on the legal structures of MakerDAO.    Informal Poll: Guidance on Rates V2  Hexonaut starts an initial informal poll to help gauge the community\u2019s opinions on setting rates.    Signal Requests   Increase the Auction Surplus Buffer (System Surplus)  Aaron_Bartsch proposes adjustments to the protocol surplus buffer either before or after MKR is burned.    Add ETH-B Vault Collateral Type  Aaron_Bartsch proposes adding an ETH-B vault and uses this signal thread to crowdsource the initial parameters.    Rates V2  Hexonaut proposes the existence of a working group whose responsibility it is to propose rate changes in response to risk and the wider DeFi environment.    Chris Mooney Smart Contracts Team Update 04:40   Last week, the domain team worked towards the collateral onboarding priority sheet. There is much work across all of the domain teams right now to come up with a priority sheet for collaterals, which we are all refining. We are optimistic; maybe next week we will have a pretty good priority sheet for taking all these green lights and turning them into something.   We did a full review of MIP21, which is related to RWA addition. It is a technical MIP. We have looked over that and think it is ready for voting, so please, consider approving it.   We did the same thing for MIP20, which is the Vox. We have reviewed the code and the MIP and I will emphasize that I think that the Vox is just a Governance tool that we could use, we do not need to turn it on yet, but it is nice to hedge our bets if peg management does not work out for us, so please consider that.   For the monthly spell, we have got COMP, LRC, and LINK added as collateral types on Monday. All of those are up, so if you guys want to create positions on those, feel free.   We also reviewed the TUSD adapter implementation. There is a fix in the TUSD adapter implementation that re-enables their legacy ERC20 token, that looks good. We are going to try to get that into this Friday\u2019s executive for approval.   There is also some internal work on creating much documentation around collateral onboarding to possibly have collateral onboarding teams in the future, so more to come on that.   In the coming week, more work on what I just mentioned, the collateral onboarding teams. Then, we have a whole new list of collateral types. We know we are probably going to break the MIP structure a bit or put it on temporary hiatus while we have more adaptability to onboard collateral, but right now, the domain teams are tentatively thinking of doing LEND, PAX Gold, YFI, BAL, UNI, renBTC, possibly TTC and GUSD in these coming month and maybe we will be able to do that more on a weekly cycle we get there.   There is some tooling happening around executives to make them a little bit easier to write. Furthermore, covered on our list is the final review of the Flash Mint Module in the MIP submitted by SamM for Flash minting Dai.   Discussion   Brian McMichael: Just to clarify, when you say the Vox and the RWA are ready for voting, we did identify that there might be some things that need to be changed in the RWA adapter to integrate appropriately with our new liquidation system. So, I would not say that the code is ready there; it just needs some updates. I think the Vox is ready to go.  Chris Mooney: Yes, that is a good point because this was a little bit of a question mark as well. When we approve a technical MIP, I like to think of it as ratifying an RFC or something. It is nice to have some prototype code, it is nice to think through and see if it will work, but there is still a whole checklist that we need to go through to build an executive and deploy it. That includes a lot of the security roadmap, possibly formal verification, audits, a bug bounty, more extensive code review, crafting all of the deployment spells. There is still much stuff that happens, so really, if you ratify the technical MIP, I think there is still one more step, which is the technical implementation, which would eventually find its way into an executive. So, those are mostly locked down, but there are still a few changes.    LongForWisdom: One thing I probably should have mentioned in my updates was that with the conclusion of the September MIP cycle, Chris, Brian, Lucas, and Will are all officially ratified as Smart Contracts team members, which is cool. Congratulations to them all for meeting everyone\u2019s approval.   Lev Livnev: Charles, can you clarify the point you just made in the comment about iterating on the code after the proposal has been accepted but not while it is being voted on? Can you explain when is a good time to incorporate changes in the code, and what is the process to follow?   Charles St Louis: I am keen to get everyone\u2019s perspective on this, but the main reason why I said that was because if the solution in the future needs to be improved or iterated on in any capacity, you can do so after it has been voted on, but if it is changing while the vote is happening, there is potential for sneaking in some things that people might overlook. However, the idea is that if something needs to change in the future, you can make that change. It is just not worth being voted on. For example, the liquidations 1.1 and 1.2 have been improvements, so you might have to have a follow-up proposal to incorporate these changes, but I think we should have an open discussion about how the technical process could work.   Lev Livnev: Yes, I think it is reasonable that we do not have a moving target while being voted on. Could you also clarify if there is a process for this final last mile when something goes into an executive? For example, is there a stage where the executive spell is actually voted by a domain team or something like that? What ratifies the executive spell is the executive spell\u2019s actual vote but is there a Governance stage before that?   Charles Saint-Louis: I can let Chris and Brian and the rest of the domain team answer the more technical details of it, but once the week-three Governance poll approves the MIPs, the domain team begins creating the technical implementation for the spell for the executive vote on the following Monday. However, maybe Chris or Brian can talk more about the actual steps.     Chris Mooney: Yes, I can say that internally whenever we are building an executive spell, there is a kind of laundry list of things that need to go through, and it is just an enormous amount of code review and integration testing, and ultimately all of that is going to culminate in an approval list so that it is viewable in the voting portal. So, let us say, Lev, you are going to work on one of these executive spells and hand it off to us; we would put it through the same ringer that we would if anyone of us wrote it individually, so it would probably end up going through that process. I do not know if there is a formal MIP around that. Maybe we will need one, or maybe we do not. I do not know if that answers more of your question there.   Lev Livnev: Yes. That makes sense, and also what Charles said also seemed reasonable. I am wondering, is it a fair approximation to say that once the proposal has been accepted, the stage between that and the spell being executed, we can imagine is the same process for any spell that\u2019s currently being proposed and executed? The domain team is either preparing it or reviewing it if someone else has proposed it on their schedule and to the same standard. And then, once that is done, but only then, it is proposed as an executive.   Chris Mooney: I think that makes the most sense.     Lucas Vogelsang: I had a question about MIP21 and MIP22 proposing code, but they do not foresee a specific executive spell to be deployed. They are just general-purpose frameworks. This is not described in the MIP process, but what is the process from going from the general code that has been accepted to someone still needing to write a spell and then deploy it, and is that then another MIP proposal?  Lev Livnev: I think that is exactly what we were talking about. Furthermore, for context, MIP20 does not have an executive spell either, and I think there is no precedent for MIPs coming with an executive spell in particular because the executive spell might have to be tailored to the state of the system at the time. Moreover, it would be absurd to have to ratify an executive spell and then execute it because it is executed through a vote. So, my understanding is that when it goes through the MIP process, it falls into the same funnel as any other executive spell for which we do not have a special multi-week process for accepting those as a Community.    Chris Mooney: I would strongly recommend that we do not create a MIP process around the executive spell just because there is so much tooling and dynamic coding that happens around that. The process is frequently changing; we are updating it to be continuously more secure. It would just be hard that one process alone would take so much MIP work. We are probably much better off too. Once it is ratified, we would work with the smart contracts domain team to start to craft the spell, and I think that is the right path forward. If anyone objects, let me know, but that\u2019s my guess.  LongForWisdom: I think the original plan was that when technical MIPs were envisioned, all of the code, including the spell code, would be completed before the MIP was even proposed, and then the MIP was proposed and then when the MIP got to the final stage and was ready for an executive vote, all of that code would be included in that final executive spell. I do not think this works out super well for the reasons you guys have just described in practice. So, as long as it does not become a problem, where something gets ratified and then for whatever reason it just does not get implemented for ages, that is potentially a problem because it has been ratified, but then it never happens, but so far we have not seen any issues with that. If that problem starts coming up, we can start looking at building a process that prevents it from happening.    Brian McMichael: We are updating our process for creating the spells and some behind-the-scenes things are going on for Governance itself, and for changing the way the votes get processed. Any spell that is created right now might not work with the new process.   Lucas: What is the best way forward for the MIP22 then? Furthermore, I think we are at a similar spot with MIP21.   Chris Mooney: That was not on my radar. Did MIP22 get proposed for this cycle?   Lucas: It has been in the RFC phase for a month, and before that discussion was about to happen, we were considering whether we wanted to propose it or not, and I think the deadline for that is today if I am correct.   Charles St-Louis: The deadline is next Monday to Wednesday to formally submit it. But, in this last week, it is the frozen period, so you cannot make any more changes as a way for a community to look at the final state of it and make sure you do not make any last-minute changes before it goes up for votes, for security reasons. If it has been in RFC for a month, you can go ahead and propose it, but if you want to continue doing RFC for another month or another six months, it is totally up to you as the author of the proposal.   Lucas: The challenge is that there was not any feedback from the smart contracts domain team.   Chris Mooney: Lucas, I will put that on our list. We will get to you in the coming week and review your MIP. Do not worry about the executive spell for it; we\u2019ll review the declaration of intent, the technical MIP, and any code you have with it. We will try to get through all of that, and then we will give it a thumbs-up or thumbs-down, and we will push it through the process, and after that, we will worry about making an executive for it.   Lucas: Today I was working on this with Martin Lundfall a bit, and we have been making improvements that, I guess, would now need to be added after the frozen period if we plan to submit it or should we not formally propose it and maybe skimp around the process that we have in place a bit.     Chris Mooney: It may be a question for Charles. Charles, I pushed the PR to MIP21 today to make the flipper work with liquidations 1.2, so we want it to be frozen there?   Brian McMichael: Let me chime in here. I see very few situations where some code might come in that we do not want to change just because, with the domain experts, we know how this might integrate with the system, we would probably want to beef up tests around it, might discover things. I am leery of just accepting code as written and submitted.   Chris Mooney: Let us say with my PR, for example, we could easily vote on this, it is a change that\u2019s going to have to happen before we can push it live, that we can certainly review it after this process is complete, you know maybe the changes for Martin are the same for Lucas\u2019s MIP22. I do not know, Charles, do you have an opinion?     Charles St-Louis: Could you rephrase the question, please? I am confused. Are you asking if you are allowed to be a contributor to the code?   Chris Mooney: No, it is that for both of these MIPs, the code should have been frozen yesterday according to what you are saying, and I was wondering how much liberty the domain teams have after that deadline. We will give them a thumbs-up or thumbs-down before being voted, I would assume. After that process is complete, rather than just crafting an executive, we may need to make some changes for security reasons or end up engaging in an audit, something like that, that shows us we need to make a change. Do the domain teams have the liberty to do that? I am hoping the answer is yes.   LongForWisdom: Technically, it is like a massive gray area, like so many other things. I think it is fine at this stage. The technical MIP process was written for these kinds of situations in the future. Loads of people would be raising loads of code changes, and they would need to be super locked down before they voted on them. We are not there yet, so I would not worry about that too much for now.   Charles Saint-Louis: Yes. The only thing that I would suggest is that, if changes are being made concerning anything, be very transparent and open about it, saying \u201cwe have done this - this is why\u201d so that people are aware and it does not look like things are just snuck in. However, yes, I agree with Long 100%.     Nik Kunkel Oracle Team Update 23:15   We can review the stuff that passed in the executive that we submitted last Friday. We had a bunch of whitelisted proposals go through:   Kyber was whitelisted on the ETH-USD Medianizer.   DDEX got whitelisted on the BTC-USD Medianizer.   We had the custom job for Opyn on the auction platform they were using.  The V1 Oracle that we had deprecated, and they did not add logic to configure that, so what we did was wire up the V1 Oracle to the V2 stuff, so one would just read from the other. That has passed.    Yearn Finance also got whitelisted on the BTC-USD Oracle for their new BTC delegated Vault that they are cooking up.     That is it from the Oracle\u2019s front. I do not think there are any new proposals for this week, so we are just working on the collateral types for October right now.   Primoz Kordez Risk Team Update 25:05   We are currently putting much effort into developing the new framework for the ongoing calculation of Risk Premiums, Debt Ceilings, and competitive rates for each Vault type. The idea here is to make it less quantitative and more agile to provide these inputs to Governance on a more regular basis. This is also partially related to this new initiative about rate setting where the Risk team will more regularly provide inputs to the so-called rates working group, and I think Sam will talk about it later a bit more.   Balancer and yEarn collateral evaluations should be released next week. We had to delay a bit for AAVE and PAXG, and they will probably go through the weekly cycle. So I was still in the middle of the migration. We still do not have any information on AAVE\u2019s new tokenomics and will also be delayed because there are some technical specifics related to the ERC-20 token contract.   As Chris already mentioned, we are working together with other domain teams on a new approach for prioritizing collateral proposed to be onboarded. Priority will likely be given to those assets which have high potential to generate Dai, but of course, we are also adjusting this list by constraints such as difficulty to add particular collateral and risks associated with it.   Lastly, there are some organizational efforts within the Risk domain team. We are defining specialized roles within the team, committing new members, and so far, it looks great. We were able to attract some outside members, and we also created a template for collateral onboarding, making it easier for new members to perform risk evaluations.  LongForWisdom: Congratulations on becoming a ratified Risk domain team!    Amy Jung Community Development Update 27:30   There are two roles that I am working on, which is the continuity of Community Development, which is where we focus on the development of community and contributors. We have a portal launching soon with tons of community-generated content and resources like FAQs. It can be anything from people who are new to Dai, how Governance works, etc. and that will be live very soon. The Forum Badges team will give an update, and there is a Governance Communication team who has been writing summaries for these calls and introducing the new idea of Snippets, which are short versions of this, and we have noticed that many people like that as well. So a lot is going on around how to improve that Governance Communication area. We do have our development grants as well. We will be introducing a new process, and this is where people in our ecosystem can apply for funding. Our two newest grantees are SaveDai and CuraDai. On the people side, we are also looking for obviously more developers, so we are trying to cultivate programs where we are improving many potential contributors who would be interested in engaging with MakerDAO.   The second part, mostly what I have been working on recently, is around DAO operational work, focused on bridging smooth resource management and distribution. There are many stakeholders to coordinate with, so I appreciate the patience people had been giving. I will be introducing a new MIP soon, a support domain. This domain would cover bootstrapping general operations for potential domains that are difficult to scale quickly. So something like HR or Legal. We have been working a lot on how we actually can have legal domain teams and what community members would be interested in covering that. Furthermore, the second piece is around cross-domain coordination. I think the smart contracts team brought up this onboarding documentation and process initiative, where we focus on how we make that process smoother and more inclusive of all levels. The third piece to the support domain would be grants management and distribution, which is a lot of the work we have been doing, and many of our community members are also grantees. It is a way of onboarding a lot of the people who participate in the DAO.   Juan Collateral Call Update 31:00   As was mentioned by Chris and Primoz, we have been working on a collateral framework to provide more transparency regarding which collateral types we are focusing on, why, and the priority in which they are tackled.   Yesterday, we had a Real-World Asset call with Seb Ventures. Matthew from 6S Capital was there, Lucas and Lea from Centrifuge, and Priyanka from Openload joined us. So we are further advancing on that front as well. Hopefully, we can see real progress soon. If you want to join us, contact @SebVentures on RocketChat.   Regarding upcoming calls; Next week, we will have Brian from Cash Gold joining Matt Luongo from Keep network that will be presenting TBTC, which is October 7th at 5 PM UTC. We are thinking of doing an exceptional call next week. It would be like a double session around RWA. We have to figure that out with Seb. We will have RAM BTC, and we are still trying to get Uniswap or Balancer, which have not been yet confirmed. That will be October 14th. Then, on October 21st, we are going to have Greg from Urostasis and Crypto.com.   Charles St. Louis MIPs Update 33:05 1438\u00d7799 192 KB  As a follow up, Sam created the technical MIP for the declaration of intent that will go into a governance cycle depending on when he wants to submit it formally.  1437\u00d7800 190 KB 1437\u00d7797 323 KB 1436\u00d7761 153 KB 1437\u00d7762 134 KB 1438\u00d7784 213 KB  There will be a knowledge transfer documentation resource for anyone interested in getting set up with a grant to work on things such as risk assessment, collateral adapters, and learning how to do these things.  PlanetX   The present version of MIP17 is a re-work of the older MIP17, and it did not pass. We had a meeting about why it did not pass, and we are not exactly sure why but the older version tried to automate the setting of the debt ceiling (DB) and the rates, which was possibly a bit too much.   The present version deals with the setting of the debt ceilings only, I will link the latest thread in the chat. So please read through and comment. It is not a very complicated MIP; all it does is introduce a new term called Target DC, a very high figure compared to the present DC. Just for the sake of argument let us say double or even triple the current debt ceiling.   This is typically a figure that will be set by the risk team, and as long as the outstanding debt is below this figure, we will let MIP17 handle the weekly setting of the DC.   As long as the utilization is between 70 and 90%, nothing happens. If it rises above 90% the next week, there will be a 20% increase. If it falls below 70%, we will deduct 20%. With this formula, we aim to keep utilization pretty high. That is enough for MIP17, interested people can look at it, and we have aimed to produce a simplified version of MIP17, and any questions can be written to me or comment on the forum.   ",

So I am going to skip that this time. I can bring it back if anyone cares.   I think we will talk about what Charles already covered regarding what we did last month. To summarize it, we onboarded three assets. We uploaded some domain team members, which is fantastic, and the declaration of intent for the Flash Mint module passed, which was also very cool.   Next month, Charles will cover this as well, but we hope that we see some of the MIPs that have been in RFC for a little while getting formally submitted, and I guess we will see which ones are next Wednesday.   From a personal point of view, it is good to see the domain team members increasing, which is great. It is good to see more assets being added.

That is because I can only fit so many, and the ones that do not get in are the penultimate of any given series, seen in the second to last.   1222\u00d7738 270 KB    We get two for sending DAI. If you send ten DAI, it will not show up here, but if you send twenty, it will. The same goes for voting on polls. If you vote on polls, you will get a badge. If you vote on twenty, you will not get a badge, but if you vote on fifty, then yes.   You are just signing a message, so they cost no gas to redeem. The back-end of this also has NFT\u2019s that are on-chain that you will be able to redeem and use for other parts. They are non-transferable NFT\u2019s so they will stick with the account that redeems them.   At this time, are there any questions?   Brian McMichael: So it is just a signature, the account is not tied to your forum account, in any way, I assume?   Anderson: We do not store it. It goes through a LAMDA function that processes it and checks it against the Merkle tree, so there is a contract on-chain that updates regularly, which is interacting with governance and maker contracts, and that is what we are checking against and getting proof from. That way, only the people that are entitled to a badge and can prove it by signing that signature can get it, but other than that, we do not save any of the information.     Brian McMichael: Can I link multiple accounts to my forum account?  Yes, you can. To redeem badges from multiple accounts, disconnect your account and click the redeem button again. Big shout out to scottrepreneur and several developers for helping out on the frontend.    Christopher Mooney: That is amazing work.   Nik Kunkel: Is this right now? Are the badges live?   Aaron Anderson: Yes. We had several people redeem already, and if you run into any issues, feel free to submit the repo where this is hosted and submit an issue. Today I will add a template for that to grab any pertinent information like your account or transaction or that sort of thing.   Nik Kunkel: Cool. I will run through that right now, see if I can get any feedback.     LongForWisdom: Thank you, Aaron. I look forward to seeing those in the forum more, so that is going to be awesome.    SamM (Hexonaut)  Rate Setting V2 51:52   Basically, a few of us have been meeting over the past two weeks to modernize the rate-setting mechanism because it is beginning to show some strain under the new assets and market conditions and all that kind of stuff.   Some current issues that we see with it:   The smart contracts team has a hard time following base rate changes and applying them to the end stability fees. They have to keep track of all of this.   Another issue is that Governance should not be changing RP directly or should stop calling it RP. We find lots of tweaking or people at least saying they want to tweak the RP for reasons that are not related to risk, so it is a little confusing.   Base rate changes are affecting all assets instead of only a few that have a similar profile. RP should be ideally measured and reported continuously instead of just one time.   We may not necessarily want the RP to be equal to the final markup used on top of the base rate.   There is no mechanism for taking competition into account, and in particular, farming assets do not fit into our rate-setting paradigm at all. They really should be getting set based on the yield they generate.     We are proposing the formation of a new rates-forming-group that sits between risk governance and the smart contracts team, and then we grant more rate-setting autonomy to this group so they can be more flexible with how they update stability fees.   We will add a market competition based rate-setting methodology that initially the risk team will be handling. For example, this will be as if someone was charging 5% to borrow a link against our competition, and maybe we can undercut them a bit, but still, we want the rates to stay as high as possible, but we could still undercut our competition.   Another goal is to minimize governance overhead with the number of polls they have to vote on.   Continual transparency of how these rates are set. This marks a shift in how Governance deals with rates, and we think it is more appropriate for Governance to be setting higher level, plain English directives, such as \u201cset the SF on stablecoins to a percentage\u201d or even, for example, \u201cwe want to focus on growth over profit\u201d or something like that. Having this sort of rigid formula is not working anymore. Please go and vote and comment on that.  LongForWisdom: I would encourage everyone to look over that proposal because we will no longer be voting weekly on the base rate if it passes. I encourage everyone to read over that proposal and understand what the changes will look like and provide feedback if you feel it is the right or wrong move.     Vishesh Choudry  The State of the Peg MCD System Stats MCD System Stats Alt DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs Maker Vault Stats 56:22  809\u00d7423 119 KB    Just to recap; High level with roughly 900 million DAI minted, which is good to say. What we have is:   350 million from ETH   4 million bat   360 million USDC-A   84 million WBTC   50 million TUSD   30 million PAX   Smaller amounts at KNC, ZRX, MANA, USDT-A, COMP, LRC and LINK     What we are seeing is the primary DAI supply being set up primarily of PAX, TUSD, WBTC, USDC-A, BAT-A, and ETH. It means that ETH is outnumbered by stablecoins. That is just something to be aware of.    1427\u00d7590 214 KB   In terms of where DAI has been trading and performing from a peg standpoint; things have been pretty stable. I think that\u2019s the theme of the week.   1407\u00d7549 298 KB   What we saw was a lot of smaller trades with the price holding and hovering around 1.01 USD. The ETH price has been holding steady but occasionally rising a bit. That is kind of the backdrop of what we are looking at as of yesterday.   1514\u00d7734 164 KB   The trading volumes have been a bit lighter over the past couple of weeks and we still see a huge chunk of that being Uniswap trades for the DAI-ETH pair.   1712\u00d7609 143 KB   When we look at USDT we saw a huge amount of that being Swerve and Curve, and what we saw on the last week was mainly Curve and again pretty much smackdown on the 1.01 USD with some of that variance in price decreasing, which tends to happen when we start to look at smaller trades because it is those larger trades that tend to push liquidity upwards or downwards, resulting in more or less slippage.   1707\u00d7614 137 KB   For USDC we see again Curve dominating that volume. There was a couple of weeks ago more volume on Swerve and then again same story of around the 1.01 USD with decreased variation.   1516\u00d7646 123 KB   For the DAI-USD pair, it tends to have a lot more noise naturally, but again sitting more or less around the 1.01 USD.   1180\u00d7810 161 KB   1681\u00d7204 40.8 KB    Not much has changed in terms of the DAI supplies other than the growing share of stablecoin minted DAI, but we did see some movements over the past week in some of the system parameters such as introductions of new collateral types recently, etc. Overall, these system parameter changes don\u2019t appear to have had a huge impact on the DAI supplies with the exception of the movement of DC. so we\u2019re looking at a DC of about 1.4 billion.   What we\u2019ve seen is a growing utilization of these DC as the goal posts get moved.    1626\u00d7201 102 KB   For example, we saw the PAX-A utilization hit around 30 million now that we have got a 60 million debt ceiling it will be interesting to watch whether this will see increased utilization and shoot up closer to the limit again.   1481\u00d7742 199 KB   Overall, what we are looking at is the top few places where that DAI ends up right now. You\u2019ve got Uniswap, Curve, Swerve, Sushiswap, Yearn, and Aave are some of these largest pools of DAI. Basically, look at 230 million DAI just on the top two out of the 900 million minted, it is a pretty significant share, that is kind of the same old story as the last couple of months, with liquidity pools and farming opportunities dominating that DAI supply.   1231\u00d7565 124 KB   The other obvious mention is Compound where you have roughly 200 million excess supply sitting the same as it has been for quite a while.   1669\u00d7555 145 KB   1630\u00d7500 77 KB   1684\u00d7368 445 KB   There are a few large positions that are around 196, 195, and those are probably the biggest market risk positions to watch but that is seemingly less risky than some of what we have been looking at a week ago. That\u2019s a potential positive. Though that is very likely due to movements in ETH price which is always something to take into account versus manual or managed movement in the amount of collateral that is backing these debt positions.   Open Discussion 01:06:35   Akash: MANA is the first thing. These are my personal opinions. Uniswap and Balancer have very low liquidity for that collateral. I think the reason the Community should take a look at that. If that were to go to Liquidations, I do not know what kind of reasonable prices they would get. So I am hoping the Community can take a look at that.   The other issue was taking a look at the USDC-A Vault, and I was hoping the Risk team or Vishesh or anybody could understand those Vaults and, if liquidations were to be turned on and DAI is trading at 1.01, what are the implications or what is the potential shortfall of payments necessary to the Maker Protocol. It is hard to grab this data, which brings another point: I would like the system to be more transparent where anybody could look at all the Vaults and, in a very transparent way, understand the collateralization ratios. Right now, it takes a little bit of expertise to go through the blockchain, but in SCD or the original Dai version, where there were MKR tools, it was much easier for literally anybody to grab that data and analyze it and excel. So I think better tooling is needed for the entire Community.  Primoz Kordez: I agree with you; there\u2019s some tooling needed, but you can get those data points, I believe, from Vishesh\u2019s website, so if you are interested in collateralization ratios for USDC, I think you can get them there. All in all, what is the strategy with USDC? We discussed it a little bit. Currently, if you look at the collateralization ratios for USDC-A, I believe the lowest one is 100.8. Ideally, when you ask about turning liquidations on, you would be doing this manually with some strategy in place, and you would be doing this when the DAI price is much lower than now, but in that case, those Vaults would unwind anyway, right? What we need to discuss here is what is the timeline, when do we want to see turning off those stability fees because we are collecting virtual fees, you know? However, we know we are not going to collect them, and we have about three months. One of my ideas was that we could shut down fees at about 100.5 collateralization ratio when most of the Vaults are there because this still creates some incentive for Vault users to actually come back and unwind those loans if DAI price is, of course, below 1.005, so they still have some capital in the over-collateralization part. That is one potential idea. Otherwise, in that, we can control most of it in three months, so I am not worried about it and, as I said, you can see those Vaults winding down every time the price of DAI goes below 1.01, there is a natural incentive for those Vaults to unwind. Although the recent unwinding that we saw in recent days, you see some of that, I think it was about 35 million decreasing USDC-A. Part of that is purely related to USDC Vaults farming Dai somewhere, and now the stablecoins farming rates fell a bit, and you are seeing people that farm Dai with USDC Vaults, they are unwinding some of them because they want to get USDC back, right?    Nik Kunkel: About that, you suggested that once we hit a certain average collateralization ratio, then we turn off the stability fees. What is the argument against the alternative for it, where you keep the stability fees on? Doesn\u2019t it just come out as a wash anyway, right? Because a system thinks its additional collecting fees, but it is not because if these Vaults were ever to get liquidated, all those fees would be a loss anyway. However, at least people opening new positions would be paying net positive stability fees versus in your scenario, even new people coming to open a position they are not going to be paying any fees. So can you explain that a little bit more? I am sure you have a great reason for that!   Primoz Kordez: Why not just manually liquidate then and why rely on them unwinding themselves? Why is that better? When there is a clear incentive for Vaults to unwind, you are sure that you are collecting your fees. Whereas, if you do manual liquidation, there are some unknowns there, they are going to be Auctions and keepers bid as much as they bid, and there might be some slippage applied, so you never know what the loss is there. Whereas, if you shut down fees and hope that those Vaults return unwind, you exactly know that you will collect all the Dai and all the fees, if that happens, of course. That is why I still prefer market-wise unwinding.   Matthew Rabinowitz: Wouldn\u2019t that also create a situation where, if you are collecting fees, once it gets over the threshold, will also be burning a bunch of MKR on somewhat fictitious fees and in reverse, if we have an unwind, you are ultimately diluting MKR by the same amount, by turning it off, you would impede both steps, no?   Nik Kunkel: But what you can do is just increase the size of the surplus buffer, and then you never go through the whole MKR dilution and burning and then dilution again. Because before it prints MKR, it dilutes MKR, it grabs it from the stability fee, the surplus buffer first, as a primary, right? It is just accounting in my mind. There is no knowing how much slippage do we have when we burn and how much slippage do we have when we dilute. There would not ever be a burn and a dilution if we set the parameters correctly.     Kurt: If I can jump in quickly. It is certainly preferable if you are going to leave fees on route to collect surplus buffer and keep enough in it to cover all those fees, so you do not have to have that, the inefficiencies that would come from first burning MKR and then reminting it. So, it is better to keep the buffer. However, the final point I want to make is that they will always be as inefficiencies in the liquidation process. One place where this comes from is the minimum bid increase parameter, which is a percentage currently set at 3% for all collaterals, so even if you had a 100% collateralization ratio Vault (if you theoretically sent that to Auction), you\u2019d probably only get back 98 DAI on it. You are looking at a high probability of losses and inefficiencies with liquidations, even if everything goes correctly.   Nik Kunkel: I mean, for stablecoins, we would almost 100% lower that threshold, right?   Kurt: Oh, it is set at 3% right now.   Nik Kunkel: Well yes, but we do not have the liquidations turned on for stablecoins. If we were to turn them on, then presumably we would lower that parameter to something like 1% or maybe even 0.5%, but 1% at least. Because otherwise, we are just taking a stupid amount of losses. I think that the missing thing here is the fact of liquidations 2.0, right? That is really what will help us in this scenario, right? Because they have an instant settlement in a single transaction, which means people can use flash loans, so the capital requirements go way down, and people can directly arb against things like Curve and Uniswap. Having an auction keeper, not have to put up capital and can immediately trade against Curve. You will get a much more competitive price just because of the amount of liquidity that there is on Curve.     Kurt: You can certainly minimize the risks involved with liquidations as the liquidation system either by changing parameters or by launching improvements to it. The question is how much more risk or disruption is there with doing a liquidation versus getting these things to unwind naturally.   LongForWisdom: I think Brian made quite a good point in the sidebar. If Dai is below peg at the time liquidations happen, then in theory, you have the potential to gain if Dai is below a dollar during the liquidation time.   Kurt: And if DAI is above a dollar, the opposite will happen where you will get even less DAI then you expect.   Primoz Kordez: Yes, but if Dai is below peg, those Vaults will not unwind themselves. You would not even be relying on Liquidations unless Vaults are clearly abandoned. However, that is the idea of self-unwinding. If there is still some over collateral inside, Dai is below, and they will unwind themselves. You would not even need to liquidate them.   Brian McMichael: 101%; I mean, there were plenty of opportunities to take a flash loan and take the arb and walk away from the Vault entirely. We cannot count on the original Vault holder to unwind their Vault, because they may not even have access to it, depending on how they coded it.     LongForWisdom: It would maybe be good to start a thread about the various actual options for winding down stability fees because it has been discussed in the Calls and the Chat, but it has not been a forum post that summarizes the various options.

We\u2019re now posting a high level overview of the Governance and Risk call ahead of the high fidelity call summary. Team Updates Smart Contracts  The team is working on a priority sheet for collateral types that are passing Greenlight Polls. The team performed full code review of MIP 21 RWA and MIP 20 Vox and think they can move forward for voting. This month COMP, LINK, and LRC were added as collateral types. Reviewed tUSD adapter implementation. It looks good and we\u2019ll try to get that into Friday\u2019s Executive. Internal work on documentation around collateral onbording. Possible teams may be forming in the future. Tentative collateral types for this cycle are: YFI, BAL, UNI, renBTC, LEND, PAXG, GUSD. Some may potentially move to a weekly cycle for collateral onboarding.  @cmooney, @wil, @lucasmanuel, @brianmcmichael were officially ratified as smart contract domain team members! Congrats!  Oracles  Whitelisting proposals passed: Kyber, DDEX, custom job for OPYN, Yearn finance. No new proposals for this week. Working on collateral types for October.  Risk   @Primoz  officially onboarded as a Risk Domain Team. Congrats! Developing new framework for risk evaluations to be more agile. Defining roles and attracting more people to join and use the framework to preform risk evaluations. Risk evaluation for Balancer and Yearn collateral types will be released next week. Risk evaluations for LEND and PAXG will be delayed. Collaborating with other domain teams on collateral prioritization framework with a focus on high potential to generate DAI, difficulty, and risk associated with onboarding.  Collateral Onboarding Calls  Advancing on the front of Real World Assets. There was a call yesterday with with @Sebventures and other working group members.  Next Collateral Call is Oct 7 at 17:00 UTC with @brian-CACHE from CACHE Gold and @mhluongo, from Keep Network presenting tBTC. Following week an extra call on Oct 14 with renBTC.  MIPs   MIPs monthly execute bundle consisting of 7 proposals went live on Monday, passed on Tuesday and was executed on Wednesday. All proposals are formally accepted. Next week is the beginning of the October governance cycle. Proposals in RFC phase that are eligible to to enter the cycle are encouraged to be formally submitted by Monday, October 5. Greenlight Polls end on Monday, October 5. Collateral onboarding process is changing: MIPs 8, 10, 11, 12 will be temporarily suspended effective immediately.  Community Development  Community Development Portal is launching soon. It will provide educational resources, documentation of programs and grants, and ways to get involved in the ecosystem. There is a working group in the community focusing on improving governance communications. New process for development grants is coming as part of an effort to cultivate programs for more developers to engage with MakerDAO.  @amyjung has been focusing a lot on DAO operational work, bridging resource management and distribution. Will soon be introducing a new MIP about bootstrapping other types of domains like HR and legal and well as improve cross domain coordination and collaboration.
