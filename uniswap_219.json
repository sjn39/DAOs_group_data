You can find me on other discourse forums as @monet-supply and on twitter. You can also review my voting history with Compound here to see if our governance philosophies align.

Also I think that he is aware of the disrupting force of defi and that we need to govern it to the good of the world. We have a chance in our own hands to make the world a little fairer finally. As we see mainstream adoption I believe monet-supply will still play an important role to our space. I trust him. We\u2019re all >early< and will continue to develop.

                    "content": "Yes happy to share my thoughts! Fee switch - In the short term, I don\u2019t think it makes sense to turn on the fee switch. My preferred strategy would be wait for v3 deployment and for that to stabilize, and then potentially turn the fees on for v2 later as a sort of soft incentive for LPs to migrate liquidity. More generally, I think protocol level swap fees should be minimized as much as possible, and other revenue models like withdrawal fees may be more acceptable to LPs:   twitter.com    monetsupply.eth (MonetSupply)  Both of these protocol swap fees will reduce LP yield - Sushi does this directly, while Curve's protocol fee should have this effect by reducing trade volumes at the margin  Fees that eat into yield compound over time, penalizing loyal LPs  2/  8:29 AM - 9 Sep 2020     10            Airdrops - I\u2019m generally supportive of the work Dharma is doing on a distribution to wallets for proxy contract users who were not included in initial airdrop. I don\u2019t support distribution for users after the Sept 1 cutoff date. Pools - I like Uniswap\u2019s launch strategy of targeting rewards to the most important assets/pairs. Deep WBTC and stablecoin pools help improve the Uniswap trading experience for users who prefer to trade based in BTC or USD, and potentially help increase volume for a bunch of long tail assets through \u201ctrickle down\u201d liquidity if you will. I\u2019m not a big fan of handpicking project tokens for rewards, it can become a distraction for governance and is very hard to maintain neutrality. Balancer does a fairly good job with their whitelisting and liquidity caps, but it seems like a lot of work to maintain and update. For now, I think Uniswap should focus rewards on ETH/BTC/USD pairs.

As a delegate will you keep us posted as to the pros/cons to proposals as well as your current vote take and a means for us who are delegating a means to provide feedback that might sway your view.  I don\u2019t expect I will always agree with a delegate and I don\u2019t want to have to pull my vote everytime I do.  But I expect a delegate will do basic things:  Provide a kind of proposal status update to the folks (a kind of proposal report) with pros and cons as you see them. A quick summary with how your vote is leaning. A means for us the token holders to weigh in to support or not your stance .  ",

Dharma has proposed a secondary UNI distribution. There are good reasons for and against doing this, but I think it benefits everyone to try to come to a decision on this as soon as possible. Liquidity incentives are scheduled to end in less than 1 month. If we\u2019re still unable to pass proposals by then, it could become an opportunity for other AMM platforms to eat our lunch.  As for concerns that Dharma and Gauntlet would have too much power in governance - this is only true if the remaining UNI holders decide not to participate. I\u2019m hopeful that lowering proposal thresholds will lead to more activity and engagement. ",

When Uniswap community rallied together to defeat it and was ready to move on to more constructive proposals, he is making a push for another liquidity campaign despite the arguments outlined in the thread against it. You do not have to go far to see how detrimental this actor is to the community and other fellow UNI holders as even he himself admitted that his proposal would pummel the value of UNI. Perhaps, this is so he could load up on more UNI so he could get more power for himself or for potentail personal gain. HOLDERS BE AWARE ",

Buckerino, its pretty transparent that you don\u2019t care about the overall health of the protocol and are only particularly concerned with holding the token. Its a pretty basic idea that restricting the supply may generate positive price pressure in a vacuum, yes - but this is a governance token for which the purpose is the distributed governance of the largest dex in crypto, so it should be fairly easy to understand why people care less about the current price of the token and more about the health of the protocol and governance itself. Either way, you\u2019ve restated your point, and your attack on monet\u2019s credibility, a few times now. Please say no more about it. ",

I have been raised all my life with a belief that damaging ,stealing, or devalueing common property is a crime. Monet\u00b4s voting behavior in every proposal, unfortunately, has been characterized by a pattern strongly violating the principle I believe in. He voted for dillution of the current holders every single time. I have been with Uniswap for a very long time so its more or less pointless to say what you stated. I am probably the most interested person in the well being of the protocol. This is why I believe that intentionally damaging the value of the UNI token is detrimental to the health of the protocol as a whole. You have to understand the concept of other people investing money into the token so they could vote and engage in governance just to see that some people are voting in favor of dilluting them beyond belief. Do you think its fair to those people? Do you think this is how Uniswap will attract more users, more governance? I do not think it is and Monet is a delegate which has always voted FOR dillution. People have already stated their doubts regarding the mantra that more supply dillution is beneficial to the protocol many times over and over again. Its dubious to say the least. I think its shameless, egoistic, and damaging. I will voice my opinion on it to protect other people and myself included. ",

Has anything major changed to warrant another treatment of this issue? On delegation, if done correctly there are less risks in delegating to a decentralized organization as opposed to an single individual, because the risk of a single point of failure is minimized.  Public/open blockchains have evolved naturally to  heed this lesson. I do appreciate that Monet-supply has volunteered to help the UNI swap community, has worked hard and appears to have done a  great job calling for and moderating the community calls, but understand he has a corporate banking background skill-set. I think ex -banking leads into DEFI could be anathema to  the DEFI revolution if the right checks and balances are not in place, and that would be my only worry. Defi pretends to be something else, and although many bankers are getting on-board it is because the banking industry is being disrupted but DEFI and blockchain has evolved from more humble actors with just a computer and internet access, and imo momentum of resources or decision power or community \u201ctrust\u201d on issues of governence which must include dev opportunities to define refine protocols  should be mostly channeled through these actors. I therefore would prefer to endorse decentralized UNISWAP DEV groups that also understand about protocol politics and have hands-on experience like HITURUNK at the Penguin Party who have shown themselves to be active, easily approachable at the community level:  ie via the PP channel under the UNI discord, telegram, etc. On UNI/XXX incentivized pools, I do support them, because  I think a larger number of smaller UNI holders (% devs) that are steadfast, should receive proportional a higher rate of \u2018rewards\u2019 than large whales that just participate in UNISWAP LP. Governance participation seems to me to be an obligation in real democracies, as should be involvement in protocol development, if decentralization of Money Supply is to accelerate. ",
