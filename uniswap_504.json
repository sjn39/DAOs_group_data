                    "content": "I want to propose something new \u2013 I think it hasn\u2019t been brought up here. So after having watched the second Community call, where it was discussed that we needed new models of distribution of the UNI supply to the public that wasn\u2019t good old LM (Liq. mining, which favors large funds), I had this idea of incentivize the \u201cclient side\u201d of Uniswap. It may sound crazy at first\u2026 but\u2026 here\u2019s the way I see it. At the current stage, I think it\u2019s food for thought and discussion and I\u2019m not sure of the technical feasibility of this idea. Rationale :   At first glance, the metrics of success for us should be seen as volume. But volume is to a certain extent dependant on liquidity or what is for us TVL. No liquidity no volume. Volume also attracts liquidity, and liquidity attracts volume. The two are intertwined. Therefore both Liquidity and volume are the ingredients of success.   The current, standard and fashionable way to compete for the 1st rank in DEX is with liquidity mining campaigns. We can define LM as a direct incentive for liquidity (or what amounts to TVL). Liquidity providers get attracted by bonus APY in the form of tokens they can either sell or hold.   What would then be a direct incentive of the other cause of success : volume ? Instead of liquidity mining, we would have client-side mining, or what we could maybe call Swapmining.   Pros:    Users are encouraged to use Uniswap rather than the competition because of this, even if the reward you get for a swap aren\u2019t a lot, there is a psychological aspect to it and people love it.   UNI gets distributed to actual swappers. These users are probably more diverse than LPs. LM can also happen simultaneously.   As a consequence, it could drive volume (we don\u2019t have data for this, yet, so Swapmining would be an experiment) mainly by \u201cluring\u201d customers from other competing DEXes or CEXes   Technically, it offsets a portion of the gas fees   Cost to distribute UNI fairly is lower because we can\u2019t give too much UNI per swap   Last but not least, It\u2019s another publicity stunt for us.  Cons:    The system could be gameable under many aspects : volume between valueless/fake pairs, bots executing useless trades and introducing unforeseen effects in the market.   Claiming UNI could be hard/not worth it for a lot of people, because of gas prices.   It could mean we need to decide of a preset list of incentivized pairs (whitelisted), which is always arbitrary to some extent.  I am fairly certain that we could factor parameters so as to reduce those risks. The essential parameter being : amount of UNI mined per trade and USD value of this amount of UNI. A good way to mitigate gameability is to calculate the rewards and make them available only something like a month later. We would need to look at the data of average swaps per days and months, etc, VS what budget we want to allocate. Then, make sure it doesn\u2019t become a way to buy cheaper UNI (which it should not be, because of gas mainly) or a way to subsidize useless trades. It would be important that a potential bad actor doesn\u2019t exactly know what he\u2019s gaining from a trade in terms of bonus UNI until after the rewards are allocated and made available to users. Also, I think excluding contract addresses would be somewhat essential (exclude a lot of bots and non-end-user addresses). (This would also have the benefit of disqualifying 1inch, etc., but alas wallets like Argent would probably not be able to participate). Thanks for reading this ! Curious to hear your thoughts ! PS : I don\u2019t really like the term \u201cswap mining\u201d,\u2026 Liquidity mining is supply-side mining demand-side mining is\u2026 Volume mining ? ",

I think this has the potential of been interlinked with the rewarding of current UNI token holders. For example \" Join UNISWAP and become a UNIMINER\" Which i think has more atraction than the name swap mining. Current holders of UNI can stake UNI to get interest on their UNI holdings but also are rewarded UNI for swapping their coins on the platform. The UNI they earn can be automatically restaked on top of their current stake. Instant reward updates are a nice touch as its important to remind the users as often as possible how important they are to the company! If the customer feels valued they will spread that value for us to other people encouraging new UNIMINERS to join by word of mouth. ",

It\u2019s a simple idea after all : rewarding users, not just LPs. I think one of the only problem here is that bot addresses could end up raking up a lot of the rewards if we don\u2019t have good parameters/rules for the usage mining campaign. Not all (arbitrage, etc.) bots use contracts : some of them are just regular addresses I reckon (not an expert, but I know one\u2026), so they are hard to differentiate. We could have a UNI reward cap per address as some kind of mitigation. Sometimes bots will front-run traders by buying and selling right after (one block difference ?). Well, we could probably exclude that type of behavior from the UNI distribution. ",

The idea here is to exclude bots to make more place for \u201cretail\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d end users. But contracts could also be accepted in general to foster integrations, yes. The way I see it, though, is that 1Inch is pretty indifferent here. They don\u2019t care that much about Uniswap. So, now that ETH is going up in price, swaps are going to get more expensive and the network could go back to the congestion levels we\u2019ve seen this summer (200+ gwei gas). At these rates, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see 100$ swaps soon. Suddenly, incentivizing swaps makes more sense, if it didn\u2019t already. Imagine if we had an ETA for Uniswap on Layer 2 (where gas costs way less), we would be able to bridge the gap of really high gas prices by subsidizing swaps until L2 lands. I know I\u2019m dreaming, but still\u2026 High ETH cost + Network congestion (high gas cost) could prove to be a worse enemy than the japanese dish competitor. @Danpi314 CHI is basically an ugly hack that\u2019s frowned upon by many ETH devs. It will be deprecated soon, I hear\u2026 The real solution here is Layer 2 support.

So for example, we could start the program with 1 UNI rewarded per block, and then number of trades per ~13 seconds would get their proportionate share? For the last few months we have been averaging ~4,000,000 trades per month, or about 20 trades per block. So, at 1 UNI per block of reward, each trade would receive 1/20 UNI, or 0.05 UNI (18 cents).  This would cost us ~$750,000 per month which I believe is a good value for all stakeholders. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for your take Figue. I respectfully disagree on some of your points. Interested to get your and others feedback on my counterpoints. I see the initial early success of Uniswap to a number of factors, but most obvious is that the trading experience is simple, convenient, and many times faster than interacting with a centralized exchange. What Uniswap is not is cheap due to three main factors: Network fee, Swap fee, and Slippage. Network fee solve: V3 is rumored to utilize rollups greatly reducing network fees, but until then, we are currently not serving customers the best we can because of high network fees. Giving a temporary micro reward will help here. Swap fee solve: There is no current solve for the high swap rate of 0.3%, and it is a reality that centralized exchanges beat us here. For example, Binance is 0.1% and offers reducing trading fees with BNB. Slippage solve: With the liquidity mining program and a general organic increase in transaction volume, slippage has progressively improved, and hopefully will continue to improve in the coming months. It remains to be seen if/when liquidity mining will return, but it appears that a scaled down version will happen at some point to accelerate the rate of slippage reduction on certain high value pairs. There definitely appears to be a law of diminishing returns on incentivizing liquidity, and this is why there is a lively debate of the forum on further liquidity mining, including size of program and targeted pairs. On your point that this type of reward does not contribute to long-term usage (Compound vs. AAVE TVL), I would say that TVL does not tell the whole story on how successful a protocol is. I believe key performance metrics we need to also look at is active users (daily, weekly, monthly) and transaction volume. On these metrics there is a stark difference: Active users (monthly): Compound (105,000) AAVE (7,000) Transaction volume(monthly usd): Compound (7.2 billion) AAVE (2.5 billion) On the hazard of setting a precedent, to mitigate this risk, we need to be clear about our intentions of this program up front to our customers. The goal of this is to earn loyalty to our existing and incentivize potential customers to try/choose us over other decentralized and centralized exchanges during a time when the network and protocol do not have the infrastructure complete to scale. As far as this program creating downward pressure on price, I would say that micro rewards to our hundreds of thousands of users will create less sell pressure than large concentrated rewards to liquidity miners. If our goal is broad ownership of this community asset (and I think it is), this is the way to go. I also believe no matter how small a user position is in UNI, they are still an owner and stakeholder in the success of the protocol, and we should encourage participation in governance from people that have even just 1 UNI. This program will create more small UNI holders and hopefully more distributed governance. We should track Gini coefficient to ensure continued decentralization of UNI token. Finally, I think this is a great promotional marketing tool. Imagine the headline something along the lines of \u201cIn appreciation of our users, for the next 3 months we will be rewarding 1,000,000 dollars per month in UNI to our community of traders.\u201d ",

I like the way you highlighted all the issues and how they\u2019ve been fixed, will or won\u2019t. Yes DEXes are more expensive, but they offer a different kind of service. I believe decentralization can\u2019t be cheaper because it needs more incentives (to fix coordination issues created by lack of central authority). I think your point about TVL not being the most important metrics is fair, even it helps solve some of the key problems you highlighted above. Asa large and ancient Aave holder I still used comp as a lending platform until last week, which makes no sense. In the end it\u2019s a lot about branding (and incentives). That\u2019s why I believe we don\u2019t really need to incentivize swapping : Uniswap is the most popular DEX, hands down. Normies won\u2019t go to sushi right now, we have all new user traction. So UNI \u201cswapmining\u201d is great for advanced DeFi users but useless for normies. They have no idea how governance works, probably don\u2019t care, and would use Uniswap anyways. I\u2019m a firm believer we should invest the treasurey wisely. Marketing (user distribution) can be smart, but it has to be targeted correctly. Massive distribution would be a waste of bullets we might need otherwise. A Gini coefficient would however be really useful, would you be open to chat about it privately ?

It hurts the democratization narrative and people like CZ rejoice. Swap incentivizing would certainly be a good thing while we wait for L2 solutions (lets be clear : it\u2019s a bandaid) but I really doubt we can implement this w/o the help of the Uniswap team. For starters, we would need to know what\u2019s going on with L2 integration (an ETA). Why is this so top-secret ? If it\u2019s in 1 month, then we wait. If it\u2019s in 1 year, then it\u2019s probably a good idea to create a swap incentivization program and subsidize part of the gas costs (maybe even for LPs add/remove operations) to foster volume growth.

                    "content": "Incentivizing gas could backfire.  Yes, it will create transaction volume which should in turn attract LPs.  However it\u2019s an unprofitable, zero sum, short term way to grow.  Remove the incentive and transaction volume falls back down and LPs migrate back to other platforms. I think swapmining could make sense, in rewarding people who swap with a small amount of Uni.  However the Uni earned should be on v3, and hopefully on layer 2 and locked until v3 launches.  In this way, we incentivize and reward transactions and we also promote migration over to v3, since users would need to migrate to v3 to collect their rewards.  Claiming the rewards would be much cheaper due to the expected much lower gas prices on l2. ",
