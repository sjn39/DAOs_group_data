I will be brief in my reasoning, and answer any detailed questions in the comments.   It has poorly defined goals, centered around activities such as \u201cHelp people understand the benefits of Dai by providing educational content and events\u201d and \u201cincreasing awareness of Dai.\u201d I find these to be low-reward tasks given that our core users are not small retail vaults and are unlikely to be so in the future. Additionally, it is not possible to easily capture the return on activities that are simply meant to increase awareness.   It includes 5 million DAI in unrestricted funds. This by itself would be the second-largest CU budget in DAI expenses. It is far too much to put into a fund that has no guidance on appropriate uses, or promises of reporting to the DAO about those uses after the fact. This has a high probability of being either wasted or left unused. Either case is not a good precedent. It will encourage proposals that treat the DAO like a cash cow. We have money, so what\u2019s the big deal if we spread it around? Not the optics we want.   This would be by a margin of 50% the largest DAI budget for a CU. Even mission-critical CUs like PE have received far less than the 9,700,000 DAI requested on an annual basis by this proposal. Given that it\u2019s unclear exactly what this CU is supposed to do, this is far too large of a budget. For reference, important CUs that directly contribute to our bottom line in a way that is unambiguous receive about 5% (RWF) and 17% (Growth) of this requested budget. If we want to spend 9.7 million DAI to grow our user base and DAI adoption, those are the two units we should put it into.   No clear record of execution. I understand that the situation with the Foundation means we can\u2019t look under every stone or have every question answered. But for almost 10 million DAI, we need more examples than a YouTube video with a mere 4145 views over two and a half months. Even if you believe that millions of DAI should be spent on raising awareness of DAI in the general public, this is not an example of spend with any return on investment. We need to see more of the portfolio of past efforts and the metrics they delivered.   In general, there is no plan. Despite being pressed repeatedly, there has been no clear explanation about exactly who would be targeted by marketing, nor what action those targets would be asked to undertake. Is this supposed to target financial advisors? Regulators? The general populace? What do we want those people to do once they hear our message? Does it even matter if most people have heard of DAI at the moment?   If this makes it into a bundled executive, it will endanger all other important decisions bundled with it. Even if this passed on polling because whales aren\u2019t paying attention, they\u2019re not going to look kindly on a bloated budget for\u2026 ???.. that also includes 5 million in unrestricted \u201cmoonshot\u201d funds. Anything bundled with this proposal at an executive vote would be in danger of being voted down and delayed for a cycle.   Vote no. I welcome comments or questions about this below. ",

                    "content": "As a future delegate, I will hereby explain my position on a Core Unit proposal. The Maker community needs effective marketing of its core product Dai. To this goal, the Strategic Marcomms Core Unit has been proposed for the purpose of Strategic Marketing and Communication. Members of the proposed group have been with Maker since August 2019. However, based on their application, the comments, and the track record of the group I have serious objections. Strategy If you are going to do something strategic you first need a strategy, highly preferably in writing. Who is targeted and who is not and why and in what order? Unfortunately, I do not see any such document provided. The application repeatedly does not distinguish between what is a strategy, what is a task, and what is an intention. What is provided is a list of tasks and intentions, and although these are all good and worthwhile I fail to see how this is going to get us anywhere. One example would be how the gas fees, which have been painfully high for more than a year, makes any serious attempt to reach the poorer regions of the world highly questionable. This has fundamental implications for the groups targeted by Maker. There is no trace of such considerations in the provided documentation. Marketing Marcomms seeks to deliver \u2018clear communication in key channels\u2019. Well, let\u2019s start with Youtube. There are four videos uploaded by Maker on Dai with a total of 4,771 views. It is not that there is anything specifically wrong with them, it is just that they fail to reach any sizeable audience. Go to Youtube and search \u2018stablecoin\u2019 - the top 10 videos have a total of 485,000 views. Maybe just possibly we should let social media influencers that actually get clicks, produce or promote at least part of our marketing? This is not mentioned in the application. Another fact about the crypto landscape is the intensely skewed power distribution, with edge dev teams, whales, and community leaders having an enormous influence compared to their numbers. In your provided documentation, there is no mention of any of these groups or their importance or how to reach them, nor any other mention of your interpretation of the present and trending crypto social landscape and how it impacts marketing. Communication People want their entertainment to education ratio to be about 2000:1 or something which is why even mediocre cat memes get whole factors more views and likes compared to educational info on decentralized stablecoins. OK - so maybe Dai is not easily memeable, but you should take this into account in your plan and discuss how to get around it. All large and valuable brands have carefully crafted emotional messaging baked into them. Just feel the curious, exploratory, and clearly infantile sound of \u201cGoogle\u201d or the direct association to fresh, new, green, healthy when you hear \u201cApple\u201d. In the world of crypto, I will point to Litecoin and Monero as examples of different but fairly consistent emotional messaging. And the emotional message of Dai is what? When a former oilfield engineer like myself can spot that the emotional element to some degree is missing it could be a bit of a subtle hint. To sum it up: Strategic Marketing and Communication - according to my judgment the strategy is not there, the marketing is out of sync with crypto realities and the communication is lacking the emotional depth and power necessary to be heard and remembered. And the worst part? This group has already had two years to practice, review and revise to get this right. Maker needs marketing - but not this marketing. I will be respectfully voting against this Core Unit proposal. ",

This might be because I am biased working with BD, but I don\u2019t think that many marketing campaigns adds sticky users. I know that Business integrations does that for Dai. We need to focus on user retention, and I would rather see the Growth Core Unit receive a bigger budget than spend it here on undefined adds. I think we should also take note that the previously most successful Marketing campaigns with Dai/MKR has been done by companies like Coinbase Earn, OkEx or The Red Cross. The Growth Core Unit should have a strong say in how that capital should be deployed. ",

Are you speaking on behalf of the growth team? If so, then, I strongly urge you to put that in the Growth unit budget. It is great to hear what you have in mind and would love to see that come true. If you are not speaking on behalf of the team, then, thanks for your input anyways. One thing to keep in mind though, this isn\u2019t a zero-sum gain. The growth unit and strategic marcomms don\u2019t operate separately, just like the DAO needs governance CU, as well as smart contract team, and others. Each function exists to support the growth of MakerDAO. A collaboration between the two teams would generate more value and synergies than one.     Gustav_Arentoft:  I am biased working with BD   It\u2019s great that you are highlighting the function of BD. You argue that marketing isn\u2019t effective enough to get what it needs (budget) to get things done like BD because they bring no revenue. Even though the overall mission is the same, marketing is indeed different from how BD operates. Their approach and targets are different. Comparing the two is like identifying the difference between an orange vs. an apple. BD\u2019s role is business collaboration and partnership, whereas marketing brings awareness and traction by creative means such as campaigns, ads, content, and news articles. And I would have to agree with you that it does seem like your view is coming from a BD person who isn\u2019t specialized in marketing or PR communications. Therefore, your argument makes a lot of sense only and purely from a BD perspective. Marketing touches a broader audience and makes it easier for BD to start that conversation because potential partners would have heard of us because of Marketing. PR brings credibility to an organization. Their input is calculated not by revenue but by the amount saved in advertising. The value of strategic positioning, branding, and credibility is crucial for MakerDAO if you believe we are heading into the next stage of growth. As for the companies you have mentioned as successful marketing campaigns, it sounded like no big role was played by any marketing department in any organization. Rather than going down that path of zero-sum-gain kind of discussion, I want to bring the focus back to collaboration. My unit is committed to work with other teams to create synergies that can take us all further together. ",

The unit\u2019s two key objectives are:  Increasing the awareness of Dai and the Maker Protocol Boosting Dai adoption through promotions and partnerships  We want to act on a campaign proposal that is deemed with high ROI for awareness and exposure. The metrics differ depending on the type of campaign. In the case of FTX\u2019s naming rights of the Miami NBA stadium, the measurement would include:  An estimate of media exposure Total number of impressions (Or eyeballs) Traffic to the FTX site User growth A total number of FTX goods sold for merchandise branding The number of mentions associated with FTX\u2019s name  The proposition would have to justify the reported cost of $135 million over 19 years, which comes down to about $7 million a year. The reality is that the details of measurement above probably won\u2019t ever be shared. In our case, after a campaign is introduced to the public, we should and be able to share some details regarding the ROI and other data to the extent agreed upon with our potential partners. I am not saying buying naming rights is how we want to spend our moonshot fund, but that is one example of getting seen and known by a target audience beyond crypto. Apple\u2019s \u201cThink Different\u201d TV ads and AOL\u2019s free trial CDs are some excellent examples of how we can creatively approach our target audience. Apple\u2019s ad touches people in so many ways without a word on computers. AOL\u2019s CD campaign successfully onboarded millions of users. They differ in the form of ads/marketing campaigns, but their success is achieved by aiming higher and the willingness to take risks. ",

I even see how Risk(!) can directly contribute to earnings. I don\u2019t believe marketing is worth 0 DAI. But if the marketing unit cannot even market itself by providing a plan, a track record, or both, then I know which units I will be advocating for larger budgets, and this CU is not it. Come back next month with a detailed plan, a transparent budget, no unrestricted funds in the millions of DAI, and a Q&A with your critics.

No matter the outcome, we must recognize this isn\u2019t about who is getting a bigger budget. It is about collaboration among teams. That is the only way to grow the MakerDAO ecosystem. @PaperImperium  You may not mean it, but your comment concerns me because it creates division rather than unity. Marketing supports all units as it brings visibility and business opportunities to the DAO from both supply (vaults) and demand (DAI users) side, and across all teams. The marketing CU\u2019s budget will only be used to promote and support the DAO and all the CUs in the DAO. It isn\u2019t about who is getting a more significant cut in the pie. On both the forum and RC, you have repeatedly said the CU has no plan, no strategy, and the team \u201ccan\u2019t market\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s ironic,\u201d which started to seem a bit off. You said that the team couldn\u2019t even communicate properly, at the same time, there was no response regarding my answers to your questions, and after ten days you asked the same thing again. Either we are in a weird time loop, or something just doesn\u2019t add up. I believe having a call with the community will help with the communications, which we are planning. Also, it would help us, the unit, communicate better if you can read my response to your questions to continue with such discussion. Here\u2019s our proposal/plan, which has been revised after taking in feedback from the community. Here\u2019s the track record of the team members and their credentials: The CU contributors also include @Saludiego_201 @Alefcripto @AdrienDLT and a former advertising specialist from a well-known agency has just joined. We will be able to add theirs for sure. My past work and my credentials for anyone who is interested in reading more. The foundation\u2019s marcomms team has been a focus in discussions, despite I am the only one that has worked there. (The rest of the team members consist of individuals who have been ambassadors or individuals passionate about MakerDAO who have inspired me in their faith in MakerDAO.) The focus should be on whether the CU has team members who can take their expertise, background, and transferable skills to apply what they are going to do in an agile environment to achieve their goals.
