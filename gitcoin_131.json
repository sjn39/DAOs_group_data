I am not sure if [others have an essential intent to decentralized governance power or not, but if they do, this feels like a meaningful milestone to pursue as the product decentralizes into a platform. I think there is something elegant and poetic about the decentralization of governance power happening in tandem with the decentralization of the product.   I also think that decentralizing governance is wayyy less risky when there isnt a complicated product rollout coming up on the roadmap (read this post to see why).  so I think I\u2019d like tie the two milestones together and set a goal for myself to reach the target when Grants 2.0 launches. I think that I can manage enough wallets operationally to make this happen I think.  But I WILL need to know who delegates 20-50 are going to be to reach this target.  So please continue recommending delegates to me! To get to 50 delegates im going to need to know about up & coming talent in the DAO.  so reminder - pls come to my office hours or fill out this form  if you have anyone you want to nominate to receive a delegation!

                    "content": "I struggle with the delegation concept.  In an ideal world, if whales lock away tokens with a commitment not to use them for governance, you automatically elevate the impact of every minnow vote.  Efficiently and without bias. But. I understand the argument that the activation of whale tokens adds security to the network and reduces the risk of a successful attack. I see the downsides of delegation as:  Delegation is not ownership.  Minnow owners (who are not delegees) have less of voice because of delegation. Subjective delegation is not autonomous.  It has strings attached, be those strings real, implied, or just imagined. Delegation is a black hole.  And here I am talking about the delegees.  The greater influence granted to a delegee, the greater the risk of nefarious activity.  Example: \u201chey you have ton of ABC protocol, how about if I give you 20K of my new bribelicious token to support my project with your vote\u201d.  Even if supporting that proposal is detrimental to ABC protocol, the delegee is not an owner\u2026 and that 20K of bribelicious token can be worth a fortune someday.  Possible solutions:  Replace (some - not all) token voting with contributor voting.  These votes could be limited to \u201chow the DAO delivers EIs\u201d and leave the \u201cwhat EIs the DAO delivers\u201d to token voting.  Leave the DAO - lose your voice.  This reduces the number of decisions made via token voting and gives voice to those closest to the details - the contributors - many of whom are minnows. Codify delegation - remove meatsack bias and influence and delegate based on data.  Whoever dreamt up daostewards.xyz  was on to something - with some work, it could become a standard tool for unbiased whale delegation.   Just build in an incremental sliding delegation driven by the algorithm (which is approved by voters). Ask for more transparency from delegates, and compensate them accordingly.  IRL businesses involved in \u201cinvestor stewardship\u201d 1) list their stewardship principles 2) publicly report their voting activities and 3) declare rational when they vote counter to a proposal.  Here is an example.  Asking for such a report from individuals is too much, but a vote clearing house (like boardroom.io) has, combined delegates principles (kind of like we do for Gitcoin) but with the ability to comment on why they voted the way they did (like this) would at allow delegators the ability to draw a line between principles, votes, and exceptions. Viola! The trifecta of delegate transparency!  Btw - delegate transparency will become more important as the power of metagovernance and leveraged metagovernance becomes better understood.  And misused.      owocki:  How might the DAO enable Kevin to decentralize these governance allocations to a long tail of up and coming leaders, such that no one is above 10% of Kevin\u2019s allocations and there are 50 up and coming leaders who are enabled?   Those three steps 1) improves unbiased decentralization, 2) empowers contributor minnows, and 3) starts to address delegate information dissymmetry. But - that is a ton of influence to give up.  Not sure I could do it. Especially since I have not even gotten Snapshot to recognize my puny pile of GTC yet. ",

It\u2019s sooo web3  I think that there are some interesting and open metrics that could be used when delegating\u2026for example  a metric that is kinda open to everyone and it maybe should be considered when delegating would be: -the number of messages send by a Steward/Core contributor on Discord. Assuming they are not spamming it could be an indicator that the person is highly involved, active and knowledgeable of the DAO. I also love\u2019s Shawns post and I actually think that it would be cool to have 1 vote/ DAO CORE contributor in Gitcoin DAO and experiment with it and see what happens while minimizing any risk involved.  . If implemented correctly and fair it could lead to cool, open and healthy outcome that could help the DAO long term. ",

The story of Gitcoin being driven by \u201cwhale-ish stewards\u201d manifested in my head.

There are a few more I would like to add to the list, but cannot due to less interaction, or they being new to gitcoin. I was thinking if a very small percentage, can be allocated to a combined set of such individuals somehow for deeper discussions, so you get to have data next time you are deciding this, but next time for now.

I wonder if delegating to folks that are already big GTC holders aligns with our stated decentralization goal. That said, I also support Disruption Joe, Lindsay and Kevin O. gaining delegations.  I\u2019d prefer to see active folks in the dao getting delegations than industry superstars that might not have the time to participate in, or understand Gitcoin Dao activity. I wonder why folks don\u2019t delegate smaller amounts to more people?  I understand there are a few manual steps involved.  Maybe it is a hassle.  I\u2019d love to see a bunch of 1% delegations used to further decentralize the power base.  Afaik the delegation can be reversed at any time.  Maybe those seeking to delegate could get some recommendations from workstream lead\u2019s and these folks get 1% or even 0.1%. Without this understanding, we risk delegations going to a small group people, probably those with the strongest ties to the original Gitcoin company or product.  But we gotta start somewhere.  There are so many factors that might make a Steward important. Will any memeapalooza champions get delegations?  What about using steward health cards in your evaluations?  What about those folks that travelled to live events and worked the booth?  What about those folks with the most CVs (like software Eng?)  Or the most time on Gitcoin.co?  Or using the leaderboard to evaluate grant participation?  Or overall txs on Gitcoin.co?  So many possibilities! Overall it is wonderful to see delegations happening!  Huge gratitude goes out to anyone taking the time to evaluate and delegate to another.  Do a few small ones please!  I was stuck without any GTC for a long time as a Steward which meant I wasn\u2019t able to vote in the early days of the Dao.  Purchased GTC didn\u2019t count.  So I\u2019ve been trying to accumulate delegations for many months (thanks Kris for the guidance!). ",

To further update that & extend my thinking: I\u2019m primarily focused on seeing Grants 2.0 shipped + reaching product market fit (so we can move the platform from centralized to decentralized + take advantage of the modular/forkable nature of Grants 2.0).  This means delegating to people who are performing as A players and are making G2.0 happen (as well as those who are helping people in the wrong roles evolve forward to find a new fit.  After that, and as the bottom is in on the bear market vibes I plan to majorly change my delegations to decentralize as much power as possible in a broad way (a good target for this = no one has over 10% of my delegated GTC). here is the latest grants 2.0 roadmap timeline that im aware of, which should give you a sense of how this will evolve over time  Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 11.06.18 AM2168\u00d71036 212 KB  That said, I am starting to broaden the delegations already but we\u2019ve got to build that muscle.

Open to changing my course of action - especially if my effort is met by efforts of others\u2026 Another path forward might be to have a dune dashboard that just shows how everyone is delegating. How is the stewards council going?  Last update I\u2019ve seen was from about 2-3 months ago on this thread. ",

Four, 5 or 6 of the largest stewards deliver >50% of any given vote. Gitcoin token governance is limited to budget proposals four times per year.  On occasion, there are other proposals made, but they are limited to about 1 or 2 per quarter. We recruit, onboard, and inform stewards what is happening, but we don\u2019t ask our stewards to help make decisions.  And when we do, their vote is - provocatively stated - kind of meaningless. For example, I am a steward.  I have bought or earned each of my 21K tokens I vote with, and my tokens earn me 0.01% of share of voice when compared to just one of the largest delegates.  Why do I bother voting?  Is any of this viewed as a problem for Gitcoin?  I do not know.  @owocki, to your point there was little pull on your \u201cdecentralization\u201d prompt back in August, and my efforts to nudge us towards decentralization have had little traction.   Might be that everyone is comfortable with the patina of decentralization, maybe no one realizes how centralized Gitcoin voting is, or might be we are so heads down-focused that it\u2019s just not a priority. I find it kind of sad.  But curious to see what others think.  There are several low lift solutions to this issue - my question is - does anyone care?     owocki:  How is the stewards council going?

I posted extensively about this here:    How should I change my delegations? [Q3 2022]   I put together a little datasheet that shows how decentralized (or not) my delegations are. S14  As you can see, in S14 \u2026  50% of my voting power was concentrated in my top 4 delegates. 75% of my voting power was concentrated in my top 6 delegates. 95% of my voting power was concentrated in my top 9 delegates. 100% of my voting power was concentrated in my top 11 delegates.  Current  As you can see, currently\u2026  50% of my voting power is concentrated in my top 4 delegates. 75% of my voting power is concentrated in my top 7 delegates. 95% of my voting power is concentrated in my top 11 delegates. 100% of my voting power is concentrated in my top 20 delegates.  Target Here is a target delegation decentralization goal:  In this target,  50% of my voting power is concentrated in my top 11 delegates. 75% of my voting power is concentrated in my top 22 delegates. 95% of my voting power is concentrated in my top 42 delegates. 100% of my voting power is concentrated in my top 46 delegates.  Summary of the above data Here is a visual summary of the above data\u2026  Is it worth doing this? If so, how do? I\u2019ll end by re-asking this question,    How should I change my delegations? [Q3 2022]    How might the DAO enable Kevin to decentralize these governance allocations to a long tail of up and coming leaders, such that no one is above 10% of Kevin\u2019s allocations and there are 50 up and coming leaders who are enabled?    I am not sure if [others have an essential intent to decentralized governance power or not , but if they do, this feels like a meaningful milestone to pursue as the product decentralizes into a platform. I think there is something elegant and poetic about the decentralization of governance power happening in tandem with the decentralization of the product. I also think that decentralizing governance is wayyy less risky when there isnt a complicated product rollout coming up on the roadmap (read this post to see why). so I think I\u2019d like tie the two milestones together and set a goal for myself to reach the target when Grants 2.0 launches. I think that I can manage enough wallets operationally to make this happen I think. But I WILL need to know who delegates 20-50 are going to be to reach this target. So please continue recommending delegates to me! To get to 50 delegates im going to need to know about up & coming talent in the DAO. so reminder - pls come to my office hours  or fill out this form  if you have anyone you want to nominate to receive a delegation!   and a quarter later here    How should I change my delegations? [Q4 2022]    because of my disaffiliation  i am not aware of what up & coming talent there is in the DAO. thus far i\u2019ve not been getting a ton of inbound on this form  so my plan to decentralize my delegations is somewhat stalled.        shawn16400:  Is any of this viewed as a problem for Gitcoin? I do not know. @owocki, to your point there was little pull on your \u201cdecentralization\u201d prompt back in August, and my efforts to nudge us towards decentralization have had little traction.   My view is that the lack of protocol/market fit + lack of sustainability of Gitcoin are larger and more imminent threats.  There are already essential intents covering those problems, but I\u2019m unsure what progress has been made against them. As someone who has been outside the DAO for about 6 months now, it\u2019s really really hard to see the progress being made/roadmap for making progress from the outside.  And even if I could understand the progress, the workstreams are relatively ungovernable because they are large, centralized, monolithic, and there is no alternative to each workstreams governance proposal each quarter. This kind of reminds me how the old product was unmaintainable because it was so large, centralized, and monolithic and there was no alternative to it.  Because of this, most of my delegates are insiders who can understand the nuances of each proposal.  I think I\u2019ve seen some action towards more decentralized thin workstreams or pods, maybe that will create some change. If people think steward centralization or workstream centralization is problem above other problems, then check out this post suggesting a decentralization essential intent. ",

If that is the case, I guess it is interesting, but does not change the reality.  I\u2019m saying that I have less than 10% of the GTC circulating supply - and I delegate all of it! The reality is there is a great deal of room for improvement in terms of other stakeholders participating in governance. I obviously care about Gitcoin and its mission, having built it from scratch nearly 6(!) years ago and now focused on Supermodular and Greenpill and other regenerative projects with similar north stars - that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019ll continue to be transparent in my delegations. At the end of the day, I am just one node on the network (albeit an og one) - there is another ~90% of GTC out there by circulating supply (~95% by total supply) whose delegations could be updated.   my GTC is a single digit percentage of the circulating supply. so i have no ability to centralize governance.  Yes, this is an assumption on my part. My assumption is that the bulk of delegation to the 4-5-6 active voters who regularly make up the >50% of GTC votes is from you.  I\u2019m not sure who the \u201c4-5-6 active voters who regularly make up the >50% of GTC votes\u201d are. According to Tally, the top 5 delegates have ~ 6.9m GTC in voting power from ~900 different addresses. (I don\u2019t even delegate to all 5 of them though)  Those 5 delegates, at ~6.9 GTC represent 900 addresses and about 10% of the circulating supply of GTC.  And about ~30% of the voting supply. If you want to see who I am delegating to or do the math on your own, I just posted my Q1 2023 delegations here. ",

                    "content": "I agree with the assessment you\u2019ve made. For context (for owocki), I\u2019m a new steward particularly interested in governance and decentralized organizing, and it seems that there\u2019s a lack of priority of decentralizing token-delegation (or even the holding of tokens). From my perspective so far, it seems like decentralization as an organization is a vision of Gitcoin\u2019s and Gitcoin contributors, but there does not seem to be much urgency or energy in making it happen. For example:  Token governance is understood by many to be highly susceptible to centralized capture, but there\u2019s relatively little conversation about eventually switching from this model Token delegations (and perhaps token ownership) are heavily concentrated in a few people, but calls to try and improve this (like transparent posts such owocki\u2019s quarterly \u201cchange my delegation\u201d) get few responses  Some guesses as to why this might be:  No clear future vision of decentralization to buy into. As opposed to an org like Optimism, which explicitly formed with the intent to experiment and iterate on decentralized governance, GitcoinDAO perhaps has some uncertainty as to what decentralization should look like for us and why Perhaps token decentralization seems less important than the decentralization of influence and process. As in, we should focus on how the DAO is actually organized first (stewards, workstreams, CSDO, etc.), then figure out how we should formally govern it later People just assume someone else will handle it, and/or don\u2019t feel like they have the expertise to contribute. Decentralization is a TASK right now. Choosing who to delegate to, or trying to provide input on who large token holders should delegate to, requires thoughtful research into Stewards\u2019 activity within the DAO.  Despite this, I do think decentralization is extremely worthwhile, especially since we are explicitly aiming for ubiquity for the our products (passport and grants). The goal for the passport protocol is to have 90% of marketshare for DID web3 solutions. That kind of ubiquity is dangerous without proper community governance in my opinion. ",

We agree decentralization in the DAO is the ideal state and we should work for that.  There are many layers of decentralization (token holder governance, workstream governance, computation, development, economics)  However the most pressing need is ensuring work streams are delivering as expected and that we find a way to combat monolithic inertia.  This could look like budget process changes, org adjustments, or clarity on milestones.  But that is one of the larger issues to tackle vs. decentralization. We also agreed to continue the dialogue and that it was a solid learning experience on both sides.  Thanks for that : ) ",

I am surprised to see Shawn (someone who joined 6mos ago) with a higher score than a number of folks who have been working FT in the DAO for a year\u2026   Hey Kyle, Good question, and thanks for asking.  The more eyes on the health cards the better.  The algorithm was define here Introducing Steward Health Cards 2.0.  The case you describe is caused by two variables. 1) the voting participation and 2) the forum participation. If you compare, both \u201cforum scores\u201d are pretty close, but the real inequity is caused by the voting percentage.  Any new person who successfully participates in a one snapshot vote after declaring stewardship can receive an artificially higher score given their vote participation is 100% as compared to someone who may have participated in many votes, but missed a few. Given we do not have many votes, it can take a long time for this metric to normalize. We just launched this new site on Tuesday of last week.  The new site is hosted by karmahq which reduces Gitcoin maintenance of json files, eliminates Gitcoin database hosting, and allows us to take advantage of improvements Karma rolls our across their user base.  We decided to minimize any algorithmic changes in the upgrade to keep it simple, but we did experiment with score appreciation / depreciation over time to try to address that issue.  It worked in some cases, but not with others. The S17 plan for DAO ops has a line item specifically for this issue where I would like to bring Gitcoin in line with other DAOs using this ranking system.      owocki:  maybe it\u2019s worth adding an info popover or modal explaining how they are calculated? ive seen that question asked/answered a few times on the forum. having it right in the product would help pre-empt the question maybe?.   Yes! this is one of our first enhancements we are asking for from our friends at Karmahq.xyz in addition to revising the algorithm.
