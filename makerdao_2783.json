The RWA Working Group have work on a model to onboard RWA, called the Centrifuge model because most of the work comes from Centrifuge with minor changes and clarifications. Centrifuge MIPs remain the truth regarding Centrifuge proposals.  Do you agree on the following model to implement RWA?  Please notice that it may not be the only model and it may not be the perfect model. If the community approve th\u2026     Discussion on the DAI Hedging Issue     [Poll] RWA Working Group - Hedging DAI exchange rate for RWA Governance       Over the discussion on onboarding Real World Assets (RWA), there was discussion around the peg issue. Real world actors want to borrow in USD. We provide a funding in DAI. In our mind, DAI = USD but the last months have shown that it\u2019s not exactly what is happening in the real world.  In a competitive landscape, having a currency exchange risk is the problem of the lender, not the borrower (as he wants to borrow USD not DAI).  Currently, the best idea seems to subsidize the currency risk by lowe\u2026     Discussion on legal structures     [Discussion] Legal structures of MakerDAO Governance       Working on real world asset you quickly find yourself with legal contracts and KYC. Currently, MakerDAO and most DAO are dodging the issue. We have ways to continue to dodge it with RWA (by using Maker representatives for instance).  We don\u2019t have a legal team yet, but that shouldn\u2019t stop us from thinking.  In my understanding a DAO is a general partnership where MIPs and MKR tokens are the agreement and this forum a proof of existence. Each country has its own legal framework and \u201cis a DAO a le\u2026     Open discussion and Q&A form. See you there! ",
