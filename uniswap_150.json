                    "content": "This afternoon we shared a proposed update to the Uniswap Protocol branding. This rebranding exercise creates a clearer visual distinction between Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap Protocol, while also injecting some fresh and scalable aesthetics into the Uniswap ecosystem. We\u2019re really proud of the vision that we have created alongside all-star designer Timothy Luke, and we hope that you are equally excited! Brand assets The final logo-set consists of 1 primary logo, within a family of 4 variations based on size:  Lockup-Right copy2400\u00d7960 117 KB   ProtocolLogoFamily2880\u00d71800 147 KB    Hero: For large surfaces and special moments, e.g. billboards, posters, backdrops  Primary: For most \u2018default\u2019 use cases, e.g. merchandise, app icons, business cards, social media avatars  Micro: For use in UI, e.g. favicons or navigation bar icons  Token: For $UNI token icons  A video walkthrough of the new brand assets can be found here, alongside an accompanying PDF. Request For Comment It\u2019s vitally important to us that the Uniswap community plays an active role in determining how the Protocol will be visually represented, so over the next week we\u2019ll be soliciting feedback from community members on the updated branding. We\u2019ll also be hosting a presentation on Wednesday, November 10th, at 1pm ET, in which the Uniswap Labs design team will walk through the creative process and the various inspirations that contributed to the rebrand work. The presentation will then be followed by an open feedback session. We\u2019ll post call details on the forum and the Uniswap Labs Twitter ahead of time. This questionnaire outlines some guiding questions that may help you think about and evaluate the brand assets. Of course, feel free to ignore these entirely: they are guiding questions after all! We can\u2019t wait to hear from and work with you all on this process! ",

However, I genuinely feel the current logo is better. Of course, I have to acknowledge that aesthetic preference of each individual person is going to vary widely, so a discussion of what would be the ideal logo would just be running around in circles. With that said, I propose a slightly more objective direction to optimize for: recognizability. Unfortunately, I also have no idea how to concretely judge this factor. However, one think that stood out is that the new logo is way too complex, in my opinion. This also leads to legibility issues with smaller sizes (which is \u201cfixed\u201d here by using different variations of the logo). That said, I\u2019d also argue that having to change the logo at different size of use (beyond addition/exclusion of brand text) is an anti-pattern because 3rd party will most definitely use the wrong size. kthxbye!

I\u2019m getting MMORPG/Monty Python vibes from the look, which while visually interesting and distinct, doesn\u2019t have a natural resonance to the brand for me. As the product continues to scale, simplicity and recognizability will become even more important and this feels like a large step backwards. Would it make sense to use the existing logo for the protocol and have Uniswap Labs undergo a rebrand instead? ",

                    "content": "I\u2019m a huge fan of the new logo / system, for a few initial reasons:   Visuals / taste : Putting this first even though it will obviously vary from person to person. I really like the style of the new logo. The vector work is really well done and it\u2019s certainly non-trivial to make something like this. On top of that, I think the nod to medieval / heraldic imagery stands out amongst crypto brands in a way that feels really cool. I also think it\u2019s pretty clever that the swap icon is embedded in the unicorn, and that the horn is pointing up and to the right. Overall, this just feels a lot more thoughtful than other logos out there.   Cohesiveness across different entities : I really like that this mark ties together the Uniswap Protocol, Uniswap Labs, and the Uniswap Grants Program through shared use of the common \u201cU\u201d shape. It\u2019s a nice commonality that isn\u2019t too over the top and lets each one maintain a separate identity while still sharing a common link. I also think this general pattern could be scalable over time as additional subcommittees emerge from Uniswap governance.   Reputability : As Uniswap continues to grow and face regulators, or engage with thousands of new users who trust it to handle their money, I think it\u2019s important for its identity to communicate that Uniswap is a serious protocol that has handled billions of dollars of volume. I think this logo system is sitting really nicely in a place where it feels trustworthy and reputable without feeling lame or corporate. At the same time, it\u2019s visually interesting, is pink, and at the end of the day, is a unicorn. I really like how that\u2019s coming across here. The current/existing logo, for me, doesn\u2019t particularly stand out in any way, and if I\u2019m honest feels a bit like a My Little Pony cartoon, which I can see being hard to scale as a mainstream financial protocol.

It has lost some of the playfulness of the current logo.   The new logo has a more masculine gamer energy feel to it, such as people claiming territories and fighting for land.   Hard to tell if it is a unicorn, very abstract.   Samples 2 and 3 have issues, very hard to tell what it is when small. Not sure what is happening under its tail\u2026   Overall, the logo is definitely unique when it comes to other logo\u2019s ive seen. I do worry it does not accurately capture what uniswap is\u2026foremost a liquidity platform. Why not focus on the horn, and the shape of the uniswap liquidity distribution curve? I am a fan of Timothy Luke\u2019s work, especially the logo he did for formula 1. The simplicity and the F1 in the logo is very straight forward. Edit: showed logo to some friends and the new logo reminded them of the Peugeot car company  peugeotlogo588\u00d7684 96.9 KB   peugeotlogo21080\u00d71580 307 KB  Also Ferrari:  I agree with the sentiment that Uniswap Labs and Grants etc should focus on their branding to be more seperate from the protocol.  Perhaps the community can do a call for entry for a new protocol logo seperate from Uniswap Labs; but only if there is a need to update it. ",

                    "content": "I\u2019m a graphic and media designer from Asia to offer critiques by knowing little about Uniswap:  Hero-Recognition: The new branding retained the hero: Unicorn, as it was a steadfast marker of the spirit of Uniswap, which helps the market and users to recognize Uniswap. The new hero depicts a strong and elegant Unicron that is ready to run, giving an impression of the royals or schools. Color Pallet-Eyecatching: shifted from the gradient purple (the classical unicorn color) to pure marble green and bright pink. The combination brings out great contrast that grabs the attention. The combination also creates a vintage impression. Logo Variations-Thoughtful: The four variations are thoughtful choices: the visual element of Unicorn serves as the hero, primary as the official, simplify the logo for micro use, the design of the token was advanced thinking which was rarely seen on the initial rebranding stage. Cohesive Visuals-Systematic: the Uniswap, UniLab, and UniGrants used the elements from the unified system - the royals, hence, they speak differently in the same room. The design meets the need for identifying these three divisions. Debate: The royal or school style doesn\u2019t have a strong connection to the crypto industry, people who don\u2019t know Uniswap will recognize it as an artsy brand. The style also gives people a solemn feeling as it represents the high class. However, Uniswap is a big brand that holds many users, so this style might make people feel proud and belonged. I think the artsy misconception and distant feelings could be solved by the professional marketing and branding team.  ",

A lot of really great points are being made \u2013 I wanted to respond to one in particular in hopes that it helps clarify things. The logos are presented in a manner that is slightly misleading (which is my bad). The large, ornate logo (labeled \u20181. Hero\u2019) is not the main logo that you would see when the Protocol brand is being represented.  Lockup-Right copy2400\u00d7960 117 KB  In practice, the mark that will be used in almost all use cases will be this one, the one marked \u2018Primary\u2019. It might be helpful to frame your feedback of the brand primarily through the lens of this Primary logo rather than the other two variations which are reserved for very specific use cases. It can also be hard to imagine these logos in the real world when presented in a void like this. In case it helps, here\u2019s a side-by-side comparison what the app.uniswap.org page would look like in this new system:  UNIsidebyside912\u00d7579 38.8 KB  More of these examples can be found in the  deck that we will be presenting in the community call, which has some more context around the process and application of the system.

It\u2019s always jarring when something familiar changes, but I think the new brand work is a strategic improvement. My only critique is that the Micro scale loses most of the character of the unicorn and really starts to break down at the scale of a 16x16 favicon. It\u2019s tough for anything to read as a unicorn that small, but I think the UNI token design is quite a bit more successful. Perhaps the Micro scale could draw from the token design. I\u2019m also impressed by the transparent and engaged process the team has put together. I\u2019m a fan of the work so far and also confident the design team will keep moving forward in new and awesome ways. ",

It is good to see the design team is taking the next step. A few comments of criticism to the primary logo above. The elements of design are not entirely cohesive. It looks like the U, unicorn, renaissance and target icon were shown to be needed elements and then forced together. Rather than a simple concept or idea of the organization. When looking at the primary logo. It has indicators of an academic organization such as a university, or college. I see many academic blockchain\u2019s involved with Uniswap. So this may further enforce Uniswap being a student group at a university or a institution of education (Uniswap University)? The renaissance look furthers this fraternal order vibe, possibly indicating a fraternity group. ",

Love how the idea of crests was brought forward into the Protocol/Labs and how they can literally \u201cfit inside\u201d (or be surrounded by) the UGP logo. From a branding perspective I think this is a great move. Brands should never stop evolving, this is a great example of this. I think these Logo marks will help establish trust and legitimacy in the coming years as Uniswap moves further into the mainstream. The inspiration of timeless logos like Barclays, Ferrari, Liverpool etc. was a great choice. My only callout would be similar to what jringenberg mentioned above with regards to when the token is shown at smaller sizes, potentially breaking down the fine details in the unicorn. Time and time again Uniswap has been leading the way in this industry, I believe this time is no different. So much detail and thought went into the entire system. Hats off to the Uniswap team and everyone involved. ",
