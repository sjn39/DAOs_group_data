                    "content": "Hey everyone, As mentioned in the recent Governance & Risk calls, we recently started developing  a Maker risk analytics website which we started calling Maker Risk Dashboard. After months (for me personally years) of risk related work our team realized that it is hard for community members to navigate through our forum posts to get informed on various risk proposals. We could say that 99% of all our past analyses are published on forum.makerdao.com, yet it is hard to search for our specific recommendations on a particular topic. Furthermore, our analyses were often supported by various data sheets, mostly published on google drive, which created a long list of files and calculations that were hard to maintain. The nature of manual analytics done in google sheets, such as calculating risk premiums or debt ceilings for particular vaults also started to burden us with unnecessary calculations, while many of such calculations could be automated. This is why we started working on a risk analytics dashboard, currently focused mostly on automated risk metrics of loan facilities at Maker: https://maker.blockanalitica.com/  Screenshot 2021-05-18 at 20.09.201899\u00d7787 119 KB  We also started devoting more time to automated quantitative modelling that helps us identify appropriate risk compensated stability fees and maximum debt ceilings: https://simulation.blockanalitica.com/ We plan to open source the model and make it interactive so that users can choose between different inputs to simulate various risk outputs.  List of current metrics followed:    Vault type metrics  Liquidations risks Risk premium to Debt Ceiling curves Collateralization ratio distribution General stats about vaults    Collateral asset metrics  DEX & CEX (real) volumes On-chain slippage Price drawdowns Volatility patterns Correlations (soon) General token stats (holding distribution, price changes, market cap, etc.)    Quantitative Models  Stress tests / Risk Premium to DC Curve     What\u2019s on our current roadmap?    Organize and structure our proposals on specific risk topic  Includes links to forum proposals Collateral evaluations Research & MIP related evaluations Regular updates on state of vaults, collateral assets and DAI metrics    Liquidation efficiency metrics  Auction efficiency Keepers\u2019 profits Participation Flashloan usage    Vault users analytics  Vaults protected Behavioral patterns Churn rate Rate sensitivity    DAI stats  Liquidity and Volumes Usage and flows between whitelisted addresses    Stress tests  Let community simulate inputs per asset such as severity and frequency of collateral price drops to obtain risk metrics per collateral type    VaR calculations  Upgrade the current Risk Model to include correlations between assets Calculate VaR by using wider array of input variable distributions    Please give us feedback on our current dashboards and our roadmap. We\u2019ll primarily focus on risk type of analytics rather than supporting a wider array of business intelligence for Maker. We believe makerburn.com is currently the best source when analyzing Maker P&L and growth related activity, whereas risk based metrics will be supported here. Yet, many of our metrics such as vault behavior patterns that we plan to cover next can both be useful for risk analytics as for business intelligence purposes. ",

Here are last week updates:  In Vaults Liquidation graph you can now see how much debt is protected by DeFI Saver. In the coming weeks we are planning to improve this even further with our vault risk score, so you will be able to see how much debt is really at risk and how many has good protection (DeFi Saver, bots, managed vault, \u2026)   Screenshot 2021-09-09 at 14-11-29 Maker Risk Dashboard Block Analitica743\u00d7663 68.6 KB   We are also now showing in the Vaults at risk section if the vault is protected by DeFi Saver, so you don\u2019t need to worry that these vaults will be liquidated. As I said before, in the coming weeks we will be improving on trying to estimate, how much debt is really at risk at that moment.   Screenshot 2021-09-09 at 13-50-20 Maker Risk Dashboard Block Analitica1509\u00d7786 161 KB   We added historical vault stats graphs.

Score will tell you how much liquid (how much slippage it has) is an asset if we need to liquidate all debt. So you will notice that ETH has a lower score than some other asset even if ETH is a lot more liquid, that is because for ETH we need to liquidate a lot more debt than ZRX for example.
