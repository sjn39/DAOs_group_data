I was listening in on last weeks core-dev call and there was discussion about the competing mining reward reductions, and a communicated desire to hear how the mining community felt about these changes. Seeing as this sort of signaling is on our Roadmap I am doing some digging into what we would need if any EIP development to support these two signals.  Requirements Draft   Signal support for an arbitrary set of EIPs  Any set up EIPS can be signaled It is okay if that set be size limited due to implementation requirements   Three positions supported  Yay Nay Either    On the ethereum governance gitter I was pointed to this having already existed.   github.com   ethereum/ethereumj/blob/165fe6060ca40325debcc3356b02c634f1f945ee/ethereumj-core/src/main/java/org/ethereum/config/blockchain/AbstractDaoConfig.java#L67      this.constants = parent.getConstants();     this.forkBlockNumber = forkBlockNumber;     BlockHeaderRule rule = new ExtraDataPresenceRule(DAO_EXTRA_DATA, supportFork);     headerValidators().add(Pair.of(forkBlockNumber, new BlockHeaderValidator(rule))); }   /**  * Miners should include marker for initial 10 blocks.

A formalized system for encoding these may fit for an EIP. Also, if we needed to make any changes would any of them require a hard fork? I am happy to cowrite an EIP with anyone for either of the two signals. Cheers, James (madeof_tin) ",

I honestly find this data to be some of the most important because it allows clients to have a valid default setting for users - no vote. We can then observe the level of signalling participation, which is immensely important when trying to measure decentralization and creating governance processes.  It dispels a lot of FUD (or confirms it) whenever there is a contentions decision, and would highlight what I think is one of the biggest issues with this network (that the vast majority of miners/users/coin holders/or otherwise \u201cvalid voters\u201d are completely apathetic).  I am against miner signalling because we shouldn\u2019t care what they want  I still believe this is a bit more nuanced, but as the market grows miners lose power to make decisions by themselves and shape the landscape for the market in their favor.  I think it\u2019s fair to say they are slaves at this point, and miner signalling is really just as valid as full-node operator signalling. However, we can actually do miner signalling since there is sybil resistance built-in. I think that alone is a good enough reason to include it in any signalling effort. ",
