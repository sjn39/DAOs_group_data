Please note I am not a user of these platforms so if I have gotten something wrong please let me know so I can correct it. Compound Overview Governance Dashboard    compound.finance    Compound | Governance Compound is managed by a decentralized community of COMP token-holders and their delegates, who propose and vote on upgrades to the protocol.      UI Impressions  1049\u00d7636 40.7 KB  Main page features COMP left to be distributed, votes currently delegated, number of voting addresses and a feed of current and recent proposals.  1033\u00d7499 33 KB  Below that is a feed of top addresses by voting weight which provides names/pictures of addresses when applicable, number of tokens (votes), and proposals voted on. Governance Comms Discourse - https://www.comp.xyz/ Discord Main Features \u201cCOMP token-holders can delegate voting authority to any address; their own, a hot wallet (while COMP sits in cold storage), a DAO, or your address.\u201d - Compound Governance is Live. Decentralized community governance has\u2026 | by Robert Leshner | Compound | Medium COMP is earned through usage of the Compound protocol through lending and borrowing cTokens. \u201cThe Compound protocol is governed and upgraded by COMP token-holders, using three distinct components; the COMP token, governance module (Governor Alpha), and Timelock. Together, these contracts allow the community to propose, vote, and implement changes through the administrative functions of a cToken or the Comptroller. Proposals can include changes like adjusting an interest rate model, to adding support for a new asset. Any address with more than 100,000 COMP delegated to it may propose governance actions, which are executable code. When a proposal is created, the community can submit their votes during a 3 day voting period. If a majority, and at least 400,000 votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and can be implemented after 2 days.\u201d - Compound | Docs - Governance Tokenomic Overview ~2,880 COMP is set to be distributed per day for the next 4 years. In total, 42% of the total supply will be distributed through the usage of the protocol. In total, the 10M total COMP supply is set to be broken down as follows:  24% (2,396,307 COMP) to shareholders of Compound Labs, Inc. 22.25% (2,226,037 COMP) to Compound founders & team, subject to 4-year vesting 3.72% (372,707 COMP) to future team members. 42.3% (4,229,949 COMP) reserved for protocol usage 7.75% (775,000 COMP) reserved for future governance participation incentives  Currently a portion of borrowing rates go to reserve pools which may be voted on for distribution to COMP holders in the future. As of now COMP is purely used for governance/changes to the protocol and has no economic/dividend/buyback benefit. Pros of entire system  Doesn\u2019t require COMP to be locked in a governance module Voters can delegate their votes to others which reduces cognitive overhead/friction Users are incentivized to use the Compound product through earning COMP A minimum of 1% quorum is required for proposers and 4% for proposals, reducing malicious actions. Voting is baked into token functionality, allowing for greater efficiencies Transparent voter dashboard for large holders Forces some accountability with showing rate of participation Distribution of remaining tokens is spread out for many years allowing for \u201cfair\u201d distribution Borrowers/Suppliers gain a stake in the product they are using  Cons of entire system  Proposals require 1% of COMP. Smaller COMP holding community members may have less influence/impact on the state of the system. COMP is distributed to borrowers and suppliers which can create some weird incentives for the platform Large amount of (most) tokens are already distributed to VC\u2019s, owners, employees creating less incentive for new players to get involved COMP holders are diluted for the next 4 years if not actively borrowing/supplying  Conclusion/Final Thoughts Compound has created some innovative permutations to the governance methodology but still falls victim to many of the pitfalls of traditional financing models. Transparency/presentation of holders, distribution, and proposals is top notch and allows for seamless and accountable impressions. Recommendations/Key Takeaways  Adopt delegation functionality Adopt Address/Voting Transparency Optimize UI to load faster Consider quorum/lock time   Curve Overview Governance Dashboard https://dao.curve.fi/ UI Impressions Transport yourself back to 1995 and you\u2019ll feel the nostalgia of a different time. Curve\u2019s UI harkens back to the days when simplicity was king.  1065\u00d7668 47.7 KB  Off-putting to some, this old-school aesthetic definitely leaves an impression. At the top is the navigation bar leading to curve\u2019s main products as well as governance functionalities. Users are able to lock their earned CRV tokens in the DAO contract for specific time periods and amplify their voting power as well as earning power. Governance Comms Forums - https://gov.curve.fi/ Discord Main Features Curve\u2019s main product is its stablecoin pools.  764\u00d7687 45.5 KB   766\u00d7534 48.3 KB  Curve is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) that specializes in tokens with similar values (BTC and USD stablecoins currently), allowing it to have very efficient token-to-token swaps with low slippage. Liquidity providers earn fees on each transaction while also receiving CRV governance tokens and other tokens for incentive. Tokenomic Overview The CRV token itself had a controversial launch when a user surprise-launched Curve\u2019s governance/token contracts, forcing the Curve team to scramble to safely, and securely verify the validity of the launch. Several users that front-ran the launch were also able to start \u201cfarming\u201d CRV tokens ahead of everyone else, potting them a sizeable share of initial funds. The total supply of 3.03b is distributed as such:  62% to liquidity providers 30% to shareholders (team and investors) with 2-4 years vesting 3% to employees with 2 years vesting 5% to the community reserve  The circulating supply was 0 at launch and the initial release rate will be around 2m CRV per day. Utility of CRV CRV is a governance token with time-weighted voting and value accrual mechanisms.  Governance with time-weighted voting Value capture mechanism to promote certain pools Locking mechanism to accrue rewards for long term liquidity providers Fee burn (once enabled by governance further down the road)  Pros of entire system  Stellar product market fit of project (long growth forecast) Simple UI (if offputting to some) Returns are clearly displayed, low friction to entry Incentives align for strong use of product (as long as token has value) Majority of tokens (62%) go to LPs over many years Design rewards long term LP\u2019s/participants the most Incentive structure can target which products Curve wants to promote  Cons of entire system  Shaky start Distribution method created an incentive to dump tokens for profit. Will have to see how value stabilizes once supply is greater. Yet to be seen whether distribution method will lead to better governance participation Founders essentially have unilateral control for years to come (faux decentralization)  Conclusion/Final Thoughts Although CRV got off to a shaky start, the fundamental product is as good as any out there. As a new entrant into the governance ecosystem, it\u2019s hard to say how this one will turn out. As more projects look to decentralize the decision making process to curtail regulators and incumbent financial structures, we\u2019ll have to see which practices come out on top. Recommendations/Key Takeaways  Discuss implementing time weighted voting Unsure as of yet how distribution will play out   KyberDAO Overview Governance Dashboard    kyber.org    Kyber.org | KyberDAO's default interface for KNC Staking and Voting Stake KNC, participate in governance and get KNC rewards.      UI Impressions  1006\u00d7724 156 KB  Noisy but informative dashboard gives tons of data that is relevant to Kyber users. Dashboard provides key metrics on total staked, voting rewards, total network fees, and voting interface. Governance Comms Discord Main Features KyberDAO\u2019s current main purpose is to vote on allocation of Kyber protocol network fees to burning KNC, rewarding voters in ETH, and rewarding LP\u2019s with rebates (ETH). Kyber protocol is a liquidity provider to the Ethereum ecosystem similar to other market making protocols eg. Uniswap, Bancor, IDEX, 0x and centralized exchanges like Coinbase/Binance. In the future, Kyber (the company) plans to roll out Kyber Improvement Proposals (KIP) to gradually decentralize operations. Kyber voting occurs in Epochs which last for 2 weeks each. Voters are only eligible to vote and receive rewards if they enter the previous Epoch before the most recent one begins. For example, to receive rewards in Epoch 3, a user would have to stake tokens before Epoch 2 begins to receive rewards in Epoch 3 for voting in Epoch 2. Rewards are only received if you have staked and voted.  700\u00d7140 36.8 KB  Last feature to mention is that once KNC is staked with the KyberDAO, users can choose a delegation pool to vote and claim rewards on their behalf, reducing cognitive overhead and reducing gas fees. Tokenomic Overview KNC was born in the ICO era and so, supply was sold to investors rather than distributed through liquidity mining. Distribution can be seen here:    Binance Research \u2013 30 Mar 22    Kyber Network (KNC) | Binance Research Kyber Network (KNC) is an on-chain liquidity protocol that allows decentralized token swaps and decentralized token exchange on Ethereum.      No more KNC can be created and a portion of all protocol fees goes to purchasing KNC and burning it making KNC a deflationary token with participation rewards. Pros of entire system  Deflationary token accrues value to holders over time Token holders are incentivized to participate in the direction of the protocol Delegation allows for less cognitive overhead and gas fees Incentivizes token holders to stay within their own ecosystem Rewarding KNC voters disincentivizes free riders  Cons of entire system  Some voters may still be uninformed and vote purely for rewards Distribution is mostly in the hands of exchanges and founders  Conclusion/Final Thoughts For what Kyber network has set out to become, their token model seems to work well. In theory, rewarding governance participation and divvying rewards to respective protocol actors seems like a good idea. We\u2019ll have to see if Kyber itself can stay competitive with other market making platforms/protocols and build out their community to properly govern into the future. Recommendations/Key Takeaways  Look into direct rewards for MKR voters Look into disincentivizing free riders (through dilution or opportunity cost) Look into time-lock voting   YFI Overview YFI began with a surprise immaculate conception as Andre gifted the world a token with no value so that he could reduce cognitive overhead.  693\u00d7179 13.6 KB  Thus a new phenomenon was born. Yearn.finance began as a set of products created by Andre Conje that could be used to better transact within DeFi. Dead simple UI sent users straight to using the products which allowed for simple profit making opportunities that most DeFi users could grasp. Yearn\u2019s flagship product was the ycurve pool on curve.fi which allowed for efficient stablecoin swaps with low slippage. Once YFI was unleashed things began to change rapidly. The particulars on how YFI was distributed are a little too complex for my understanding but Andre was able to amalgamate aspects from many different protocols to create a frankenstein of yield farming perfection. At the time, nothing had been done like this before. Once the dust settled and the pools had all been tapped of YFI rewards, governance began at a rapid pace. Meme\u2019s about Andre\u2019s fast production began and a new community of passionate users was created. As of today, YFI\u2019s main product is now the \u201csmart fund\u201d. Here is @Cyrus coining the phrase. \u201cnow we have a \u201csmart fund\u201d stablecoin: yUSD (aka yyCRV). yUSD is basically a decentralized hedge fund in a stablecoin. Your money is earning yield while also executing trading strategies for you. Currently they are mostly low-risk farming strats, but could easily see them evolve out the risk spectrum over time\u2026Stablecoins => smart yield => smart fund.\u201d Governance Dashboard https://ygov.finance/ UI Impressions  978\u00d7537 19.8 KB  Almost too simple. New governance dashboard is in the works I believe. Governance Comms Discourse - https://gov.yearn.finance/ Discord Main Features As previously stated, Yearns flagship product is the y.curve.fi pool. It currently has over $800 Million TVL earning swap fees for LP\u2019s. Their newest products are vaults which allow users to deposit tokens into respective pools which execute trade strategies voted on by YFI governance. Speaking of governance, glancing at YFI discourse will show a flurry of activity as the \u201cfair\u201d distribution of YFI empowered participants to feel a sense of ownership and passion not common in VC funded projects. Proposals are created and discussed on the forums and put to a vote by YFI stakers in the governance contract which also rewards stakers with ecosystem fees. Tokenomic Overview YFI was distributed through 3 farming pools which contained 10,000 YFI each. Once the pools were mined out, YFI owners voted to release no more tokens, thus YFI is currently a deflationary token with a very low supply. Yearn products go towards purchasing more YFI for governance stakers/voters. Current voting distribution analysis looks like this:  YFI Distro1891\u00d7965 219 KB  Pros of entire system  One of a kind distribution created passionate and empowered community of top DeFi members. Iteration speed is blazing fast. Partially due to no auditing but also large and skillful community conglomerate. Strong incentives for users created great value lockup with positive feedback loops. Deflationary token model with buyback incentives for participants creates further positive feedback loops.  Cons of entire system  Although governance is fairly decentralized, Andre is still a key-man risk to the success of the YFI ecosystem. Speed of iteration comes with larger smart contract risks. No more tokens and a large price may turn away large scale adoption outside informed crypto enthusiasts.  Conclusion/Final Thoughts With his skills, Andre was seemingly able to capture lightning in a bottle by combining many facets of trendy yield farming strategies and packaging them into the \u201cperfect\u201d product with a near perfect distribution method. While probably impossible to duplicate at this time, lessons can definitely still be gleaned from this story. It will be interesting to see whether the success this community has had will continue into the future. Recommendations/Key Takeaways  Explore distribution methodology that creates a passionate user base Explore governance staking providing protocol rewards   Final Notes I am not an expert in any of these ecosystems. If I have made errors in judgement or construed facts/events please let me know. These thoughts and analyses are of my own. I do not own any of these tokens. Thanks for reading!

Curve forum, and they got a unique discourse skin too. https://gov.curve.fi/  fee burn  Curve might distribute fees instead to the time-locked curve instead of burning fees. It\u2019s quite a popular choice right now. It\u2019s sort of interesting, the distributing dividends vs fee burn is a completely different argument when you\u2019re locking up capital, and doing time-weighted voting. Distributing dividends is just so much more capital efficient for long-time lock voters. And they\u2019re the ones making the decisions. It\u2019s a very interesting trend of time-locking governance tokens. There\u2019s also some protection against people who borrow governance tokens.      Aaron_Bartsch:  Deflationary token model with buyback incentives for participants creates further positive feedback loops.   YFI doesn\u2019t have a deflationary model. It\u2019s a dividend model. Which is quite unique since most DeFi projects aren\u2019t printing cash. And then might switch to some kind of time-weighted dividend/governance system. ",
