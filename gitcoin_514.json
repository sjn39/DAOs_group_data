This proposal looks to ratify this one-time allocation for GR10. We\u2019re posting this proposal in parallel to the Seasons proposal based on forum feedback & community discussion. This proposal is a one-off incentive to help dogfood grants which support the GitcoinDAO. We anticipate that this proposal will serve as a first step towards further allocation of treasury funds towards important causes across the Gitcoin ecosystem.  Motivation The \u201cGitcoin builds Gitcoin\u201d grants category was initially proposed to help bootstrap infrastructure and tooling that will support the GitcoinDAO. At the same time, Gitcoin DAO treasury holds a large amount of GTC meant to be used to develop Gitcoin. This proposal looks to utilize a portion of this allocation and distribute it to any grants that qualify within \u2018Gitcoin Builds Gitcoin\u2019. As examples, Grants like Treasury Strategy for Gitcoin and Memes, Merch, Marketing are included in this category. The overall goal of this program is to provide funding for teams, projects and ideas that make GitcoinDAO easier to use, more accessible, and more decentralized.  Specification Allocate a one-time grant of 20,000 GTC to the \u2018Gitcoin builds Gitcoin\u2019 GR10 category. Note, this allocation could also be 10,000 GTC (which would be closer to the total amount of GR10 Matching to the \u2018Gitcoin Builds Gitcoin\u2019 ($50k matching and ~10k in contributions))  These funds will be allocated from the Community Treasury. The funding will be allocated to grants in the \u2018Gitcoin builds Gitcoin\u2019 category pro-rata using the same quadratic formula as matching pool funds. Looking forward to future grants rounds, this funding will encourage the community to create grants for the Gitcoin builds Gitcoin category, resulting in more active development of both core and periphiral infrastructure for the GitcoinDAO.   TL;DR Allocate 10k or 20k GTC from the Community Treasury to the \u2018Gitcoin builds Gitcoin\u2019 GR10 category in order to accelerate development of tooling and infrasturcture for the GitcoinDAO.

Projects that posted earlier had an advantage and some that posted late seem way underfunded, specifically the Anti Fraud Workstream. If this proposal proceeds to voting, then we will have a situation where the stewards, who seem to be the main recipients of this side round, will be voting on whether or not to allocate GTC to themselves/their projects.

I\u2019d vote for sticking with 20k GTC as we want the owners of these grants to have more governance power in the system, since they are the ones actually stepping up to do the work. This would furthermore drive up the interest for becoming a Steward, and force the existing stewards to come up with a better screening process for adopting new stewards. Lastly I think you probably want the stewards to have more of the GTC distro over other group\u2019s at this time, as they are the ones least likely to sell the tokens onto the market, because we know the ultimate long term value of the Gitcoin protocol and we can impact it\u2019s success. If the community of GTC holders is against this idea then they are free to remove delegation from those who support rewards and vote for someone who is willing to do everything out of the goodness of their hearts  but to me that doesn\u2019t make economical sense and doesn\u2019t align incentives towards long term contributions and doesn\u2019t encourage the stewards to keep driving value into the ecosystem that benefits the entire token holder community. These are just my thoughts, and I\u2019d be happy to hear from others on this. Thanks for posting this @James you\u2019re collaboration here is top notch \ud83c\udffc ",

So as they say, don\u2019t fight em, join em,  As far your first comment, caring about the DAO doesn\u2019t make the wheels of progress move, actions do, and IMO those actions need to be rewarded in some way so that there is a proportional flow of value between the network and it\u2019s participants.

After reading the proposal and the snapshots this is to allocate extra GTC to the grants that belonged in the Building Gitcoin category. These are grants that are made in order to improve gitcoin, so it makes sense to have some extra incentives for that work. Can\u2019t be sure on the actual amount but this is for the gitcoin treasury people to decide, if they can afford it. Would have been nice to have a bit more options on the amount I guess. But overall the idea is good and I am incilned to vote for it. We would need to make sure very carefully though which grants get approved to be on the improving gitcoin category. As with these extra incentives grants will want to switch to be part of this category. ",

Would have been nice to have a bit more options on the amount I guess.   Thank you. This helps me cast my vote then. My only feedback is as stated above to have the amount also decidable. Additionally we need to have some form of strict requirements for the \u201cGitcoin DAO\u201d grants as the presence of extra incentives will make many people want to categorize their grants in this category.
