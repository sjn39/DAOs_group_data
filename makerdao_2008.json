Sentence Summary A methodology for applying Hats Protocol to systems and permissions in the Maker Protocol.  Paragraph Summary MIP93 sets the procedure for creating a recognized permission tree through Hats Protocol. Hats allow for real-time, on-chain, verifiable roles to be maintained throughout the Maker Protocol. This MIP enables groups to catalog their usage of Hats Protocol.  Component Summary MIP93c1: Defining a Hats Tree Defines what a Hat Tree is and how it can be utilized by the Maker Community. MIP93c2: Hats Tree Subproposal Defines the template and mandated waiting times for applying for a Hats Tree. MIP93c3: List of Active Trees Defines and hosts a list of active Hats Trees being maintained in the Maker Ecosystem. MIP93c4: Special considerations Details items that MIP93c2 applicants and the community may want to consider before accepting a new Hats Tree.  Motivation Governance is only as strong as the tools the community believes in using. Maker has a not-so-unique issue where despite being a protocol with values of decentralization and on-chain verification, most social structures and powers within the DAO are documented and maintained through Web2 means. Utilizing Hats Protocol gives Maker a chance to manage permissions in a Web3 native way. One challenge the MakerDAO faces in particular is with maintaining transparent and accurate information. Much work is done based on social expectations, leaving the DAO vulnerable to social engineering attacks and lacking in on-chain transparency of DAO structure. Hats Protocol will allow for the DAO to make use of permission trees that can be manually or programmatically managed. Chiefly, this allows for social structures and on-chain behavior to be represented with a \u201cHat\u201d demonstrating the bearer\u2019s role within an organization. These tokens are non-transferable but can be revoked or toggled by higher level \u201chats.\u201d As ERC-1155s, these tokens have the added benefit of being able to have the same token minted to multiple parties. In practice, this allows for joint responsibilities and permissions to be represented on-chain. Ultimately, this MIP serves to establish the \u201csandbox\u201d of Hats Protocol for Maker to play with and build on top of during and after the transition to End Game. We foresee useful applications for token-gated chats, multisig membership, user outreach, and representing social structures on-chain.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP93c1: Defining a Hats Tree A Hats Tree is an all-encompassing term for a permission tree of Hats ERC-1155 tokens being utilized by the Maker Ecosystem. While items like a Web UI and visualization of the permissions tree would fall under this definition, it is primarily the ERC-1155 tokens themselves and their network of permissions and roles. Every Hats Tree will need a \u201cchief hat\u201d with the highest of permissions for that tree and a defined name and purpose for the tree. Beyond that, the number and distinction of types of Hats within the Tree are up to the user group.  MIP93c2: Hats Tree Subproposal When someone from the Maker Ecosystem has an idea for a Hats Tree they would like to be recognized by the Maker Protocol, they must fill out a Hats Tree Subproposal. These proposals must be made with a MIP93c2 Subproposal Template and are subject to the following parameters before entering the weekly governance cycle:  Request for Feedback Period: 2 weeks. Frozen Period: 1 week.  Once onboarded, a Hats Tree may be wound down and removed by posting a short notice to the Maker Forum, tagging the MIPs editors.  MIP93c3: List of Active Trees This component contains the list of all active Hats Trees certified by Maker Governance. This list is maintained by the MIP Editors and will be updated upon passage of a new Hats Tree, or public notice of a tree no longer being maintained. The list format will be as follows: Hats Tree Name: Top-Hat Tree ID (identifies what Hat is in charge of that domain): Hats Tree Description (provided in MIP93c2 subproposal template): Hats Tree Owner (preferred name and address):   MIP93c4: Special Considerations Both potential owners and voters should be aware of some practical limitations of running a Hats Tree. Fundamentally, Hats Trees are a tool and will only be as effective as the ideas and people behind them. Since the Hats Tokens represent a bespoke contract and imply the desire to build systems on top of them, all users should be aware of the token they are receiving. Note: users do have the ability to \u201crenounce\u201d assigned hats. If community members wish to use Hats Trees in a way that cannot guarantee full opting-in of users (i.e., creating a Hats Tree for anyone maintaining a Maker Vault), significant effort should be spent to making sure the announcement of the program is well publicized and widely understood by relevant UIs. Additionally, when used for securing multisig funds, users must be warned that a vulnerability with the Hats contract could result in multisig funds being at risk. As such, any implementation looking to use Hats Trees for multisig signers should minimize the amount and duration of holding assets in the multisig. ",

                    "content": "Hats Protocol has potential to be a powerful tool in combination with launching the Pregame. In particular I\u2019m thinking the CVC operations of 5.4 - Constitutional Voter Committee Recognition Process and 5.6 CVC Member participation rewards (will quote the relevant text below) could be modeled with an instance of Hats. This MIP93 could then be narrowly defined for a trial under the Ecosystem Scope. Hats would provide an out-of-the-box engineering solution early on for the tracking of participants and their contributions, rewards entitlement and payouts. I understand the Hats protocol is very composable and engineering resources would be minimal to implement. The advantage being to leapfrog what would otherwise be required to design Maker-native infrastructure from scratch. @Derek I particularly love that Hats is designed to work with both individuals and groups. The future of decentralized workforce scalability is very much group-to-group or DAO2DAO rather than specifically DAO2Person. Hats Protocol unlocks the ability to take the subDAO concept all the way down to even the most basic tasks. Update: Nice perspective from our Growth Facilitator from an early post last October!    Proposal Idea - Utilizing Hats Protocol ERC-1155s   I met Hats Protocol guys during Devcon and I thought, oh, this might be the way to start our way to build a pseudonymous online identity in our community, so instead of being individuals collaborating in a DAO, we could become into eth addresses wrapped by a legal entity and with an assigned hat. How can we proceed with this?   With the organizational changes this year at @ACREinvest we are working toward providing services in a way that is non-attributable to known individuals at the point of delivery. The approach has a few things in common with the Endgame controversial stance on anonymity:    WIP Pregame Maker Constitution MIP draft   4.4: Constitutional Conserver anonymity and privacy Constitutional Conservers are encouraged to be anonymous. After the launch of the Endgame Maker Constitution this will become a requirement.   Non-attribution as we\u2019re adopting it is primarily designed for social benefits, scalability and consistency of output. Not for any physical resiliency per se. Individual contributors can choose to be known or unknown in their work for ACREinvest, membership in ACRE DAOs and/or participation in services provided to MakerDAO by the group. Persons may want to silo attribution and reputation, thus partitioning some work that is connected to their IRL identify and other work that is anon. The non-attribution approach is a middle ground worth exploring. For the work products needed from CVCs, it shouldn\u2019t matter if one is an individual contributor or a working group formed to share the load on particular tasks with the output, engagement and compensation consolidated to a single Hats-powered wallet and single identity. Hats Protocol would allow us to implement a reputation and tracking system that is quite an advanced breakthrough in Web3 workforce design and management. For those who missed it, the Know Your MIP video is highly recommended to hear from the team directly and consider use cases for Maker.        WIP Pregame Maker Constitution MIP draft   5.4: Constitutional Voter Committee Recognition Process Permissionless Voter Committees can become recognized as CVCs by the Arbitration Scope if they fulfill the CVC eligibility requirements for participation and internal governance for at least one full quarterly governance cycle. If at any time after becoming recognized as a CVC, the CVC no longer completely fulfills all of the eligibility requirements, it immediately loses its recognition as a CVC.   5.4.1: A CVC must have at least one registered CVC Member that is a Constitutional Conserver and that has publicly verified ownership of MKR, based on the process for verifying MKR as specified in the Arbitration Scope.  5.4.2: A CVC must follow a standardized internal governance process for determining membership, creation of Governance Strategy Position Documents, and other decisions.   5.4.2.1: CVC Members vote on CVC decisions based on their relative ownership of verified MKR.  5.4.2.2: New CVC Members are included based on an application that is either accepted or rejected through a CVC decision.  5.4.2.3: Existing CVC Members can be removed through a CVC decision.  5.4.2.3: A minority quorum of CVC Members based on verified MKR can trigger a CVC split. The Arbitration Scope determines the minority quorum. All CVC Members then vote to support one of two new CVCs, with the naming rights and infrastructure inhereted by the side with more MKR in support. The CVC Members of each of the two new CVCs is determined based on who voted to support each side.   5.4.2.3.1: During the Pregame all Governance Strategy control also transfers fully to the side with more MKR - however this is not sustainable as it discourages the minority in an internal CVC dispute, and in the Endgame Maker Constitution must be changed to the voter strategy control splitting proportionally based on MKR amounts in support of each side.      5.4.3: A CVC must, through a CVC decision, create a legitimate Governance Strategy Scope Position Document for each of the 12 Scopes, each quarterly governance cycle. CVCs must also convene a CVC Subcomittee Meeting to discuss the creation of the Governance Strategy Scope Position Document for each of the 12 Scopes, each quarterly cycle.       WIP Pregame Maker Constitution MIP draft   5.6: CVC Member participation rewards CVC Members that participate in a CVC can be eligible for CVC Member participation reward that recognizes the time they are spending to support Maker Governance.   5.6.1: The CVC Member participation compensation is paid out based on participation within each scope every quarter. To qualify for the participation reward for a particular Scope the CVC Member must both have attended the CVC Subcommittee Meeting and be co-author on the CVC Governance Strategy Position Document.  5.6.2: The yearly total CVC Member participation rewards is 500 MKR. This amount is broken into tranches of 10.41 MKR for each Scope per quarterly governance cycle, and shared across the reward slots for that Scope.  5.6.3: The MKR for the CVC Member participation rewards is taken from the protocol MKR reserve of the Pause Proxy.  5.6.4: During the Pregame the number of rewards slots for each tranche is 14. This gives a reward of 0.725 MKR for participation in each Scope per quarter for each CVC Member that obtain reward slots.  5.6.5: The reward slots of a tranche are awarded to the CVC Members that have fulfilled the participation requirements for the tranche and have the highest verified MKR balances.
