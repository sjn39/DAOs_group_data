                    "content": "One common thread that I see in all of Gitcoin\u2019s initiatives is a dedication to trying to rally around and create positive-sum games. The original bounties platform sought to create win-win situations between those who needed work and those who wanted to supply it, reducing coordination costs and enhancing ecosystem efficiency. Grants seeks to make giving funds fun, and create a positive-sum game around funding the ecosystem. KERNEL looks at educating from a holistic perspective, and seeks to train people to think positive-sum. I\u2019d like to suggest a workstream dedicated to discovering positive-sum loops in the wider ecosystem and trying to implement them. We\u2019re watching more zero-sum games creep in, imho, especially as the financial applications bloom. Traditional finance is often fond of zero-sum games, and if we want to try to keep the positive-sum ecosystem, we should be looking for every vector we could make it happen in. I see this as primarily being a working group and task force. A working group to think of and research new ideas, and a task force that can go make it happen. As a member of the Ethereum Cat Herders, I see this as being very much in line with our ethos of decentralized ecosystem coordination, and would be very happy to try to coordinate collaboration. Thoughts? Feedback? ",

                    "content": "My original thoughts were of a kind of think-tank/task force. Does that fit in to your track? By the name, I thought they might need to be separate - the idea I\u2019m thinking of isn\u2019t about funding necessarily. Maybe I\u2019ll give one example that\u2019s been weighing on me for a while. While I\u2019m hesitant to name names, I think they are necessary for the following. I think it\u2019s clear that Uniswap and Sushi view attracting liquidity as something approaching a zero-sum game at this point. There have certainly been a bunch of salty memes between the two camps. If we posit that zero-sum behavior is less productive for the ecosystem than positive-sum, the next step would be to think of how to flip attracting liquidity into an overtly positive-sum game. The first thought (at least for me) was that if it was possible to create a layer in between the two (and whomever, so long as security can be assured) which allowed Sushi to benefit from Uni\u2019s liquidity and vice versa, then each would be interested in the other platform accruing liquidity, since their own boat is also moved up with the rising tide. I have no idea how that would be possible. It might be impossible. It\u2019s an example of something that a group could research, coordinate, and implement (if it is possible). It might even be able to be permissionless. There\u2019s nothing about funding goods in there, though, I think this might be more like \u201ckeeping public goods good or making them gooder\u201d if I can riff off of @owocki 's frequent line. That being said, if you think the best way forward is a merge, I\u2019m all for it. I just wanted to be clear about what I\u2019m talking about. And nice to see you too @Yalor ! Looking forward. ",
