One of the stratum protocols must be modified to include information about the mining algorithm. I believe that fixing the block number when the switch will happen is too risky, especially when the mining workers do not receive the block number, just the epoch seed hash. For that I propose  modifying the EthereumStratum by NiceHash. I think the new spec deserves a separate EIP.   Also the \u201cgetWork\u201d JSON-RPC based protocol should be modified to include the information about algorithm. This is the language (sometimes the only one) many Ethereum clients speak.   The ProgPoW verification code must be added to many libraries, including:  https://github.com/chfast/ethash https://github.com/ethereum/ethash  https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/consensus/ethash.        eosclassic:   ProgPOW stratum and getWork implementation must be implemented to one of the following open source mining pool implementation   https://github.com/sammy007/open-ethereum-pool https://github.com/ocminer/ethcore-pool-mpos    ",

Regarding the open source pool code, I have had the OEP software developer do custom builds for us in the past (including the recent Parity rpc convention change).
