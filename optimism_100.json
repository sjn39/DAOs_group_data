If you have any questions please feel free to join our Discord server Project Name: Dope Wars Author Name: Butterbum.eth on behalf of Dope Wars DAO Number of OP tokens requested: ? L2 Recipient Address: 0x90103beDCfbE1eeE44ded89cEd88bA8503580b3D Relevant Usage Metrics: +21 500 transactions, +18 100 ERC-1155(items of Gear) on Optimism. 4 600 sales on Quixotic with a volume of 100 ETH Optimism alignment: Dope Wars is an open metaverse project with a \u201cPlay To Own\u201d model, where we envision multiple games and digital environments in our future ecosystem. Dope Wars DAO is run by a community of like minded individuals with a collective determination to striving towards the Dope Wars DAOs vision. In Nov 2021 our first Hustler was initiated from Ethereum mainnet to Optimism network(FLEX Hustler). Dope Wars decided early on to make Optimism network the home of our ecosystem. Currently Our open-world 2D MMO (massively multiplayer online) metaverse built on Optimism has one fully completed map for Hustlers to explore, with interiors and more on the way. Hustlers can chat, vibe, and interact with each other on the map while completing quests and playing mini-games. The DOPE MMO metaverse experience will also be the home for launching additional games like entering into the DOPE WARS Game on Starknet.  You can learn more about what the Dope Wars DAO is building here Proposal for token distribution Dope Wars is a fork of the Loot protocol with a GTA spin. Our Ethereum mainnet DOPE NFT collection has 9 items(GEAR) associated with each NFT. Users are required to claim/initiate the gear which mints the corresponding items on Optimism network as an ERC-1155. This function can only be called once per DOPE NFT. These items can then be equipped to a character (HUSTLER) to interact with our Dope Wars games. All Hustlers are fully customizable and free to mint without gear on Optimism, allowing anyone to participate in our MMO metaverse. For more info please check out Dope-Wiki & our GitHub. Dope Wars was a free mint and has had no formal funding, all treasury funds have come from royalties in secondary sales on OpenSea and Quixotic. Unfortunately we will not be-able to match incentives. We anticipate all incentives to be distributed within 24 months. ",

I see why you are asking for 1M of token, its a huge number but it make sense when I look at the total NFT migration that needs to happen. On other side, I dont see if this will help with OP growth, and I am no talking about TVL but I am talking about chain activities. Also, you are seeking funding for 24Month which is also good but no one knows what will happen to OP token in two year and you are not gonna use all of them in first 6 month either. Will it be possible for you and the team to request less amount of token in this proposal, once you feel that tokens are about to exhausted, you submit a new proposal. Benefit here is that, you will have data from the first proposal to support the new proposal and it will give us confidence to approve the proposal. in the current form, I see 1M of highly volatile token for 24 month for something that is not tested on a bear market. What do you think ? ",

Addressing your concerns over chain activity\u2026 With the launch of our game we expect chain activity to rise considerably as most actions will require interacting with Optimism network. Dope Wars MMO game has many exciting avenues being explored and yet to be explored, Our community is ambitious and is on track in executing the first metaverse related game on Optimism. We are very confident that with the release of Dope Wars MMO games we will increasing on-chain activity and create environments for all communities to participate. ",

I also think OP should vote on his own proposal even if he is a delegate. If the proposal were to pass, it would bring more users to Optimism, which means it is in everyone\u2019s best interest (in the Optimism ecosystem) for the OP to vote yes on it, of course if the proposal is sensible. 1mil $OP doesn\u2019t sound like a lot. It is merely 0.465% of the official reported circulating supply. As the projects receive their grants, this percentage will be even smaller. If you put 1mil $OP against the total supply, the allocation percentage is 0.02%. I personally believe it is justified.

Dope Wars has been on my radar for a while now, alongside other projects which also choose Optimism, and the future is in this community\u2019s hands.

Development of a new concept is hard especially when its community managed, direction can change anytime, lack of motivation and unforeseen challenges. I can understand why you are asking for 1M but you need to support you reasoning for 45% dev funding. My goal is support with anything that can help gown OP ecosystem but from my tradfi experience, I also know that 40% project never goes beyond POC and if similar thing happen to your project we are wasting 450K OP token.

These are incentives for users playing the game on optimism, and can effectively make their gas transactions for the game free, with even something on top making it a true free to play experience, or play to earn without having to actual purchase game assets, as hustlers are free to mint. Not only does this present an opportunity to showcase Optimism as a gaming L2, but also mimics Optimism\u2019s ethos allowing non token holders to have a say. In this case, non game asset owners to have a play, and even earn (and own). 45% On average, Dope Dao spending has been totaling under 20 to 30k for several, several months, even during much better market conditions. It is not flamboyantly spent and should offer little if any market pressure on Optimism, while leading to a premier game on Optimism that rewards its players. The 45 % represents .2 percent of total Op supply in circulation 1/448th, and around .011 percent at max supply (4 billion plus) not counting yearly inflation that would be significantly beneficial to Dope Wars as well as Optimism. An exploration of the Discord in the contributor channels easily shows this goes beyond a proof on concept.   Magic on Arbitum is a good comparison to see the potential Dope Wars has on Optimism, and what it can bring the ecosystem. This allocation could allow Optimism\u2019s community to contribute to a project in line with its ethos, a project that highly values community contribution and is open arms for contributors of all types.

We believe the token distribution is quite fair, and will provide us the resources necessary to retain more active devs as the project matures. Many of us have worked on this project being undercompensated, or not compensated at all.

We feel Incentivizing our development is one of the best way to incentivize growth on Optimism. Building a strong gamming product will lead to a flood of new users joining and transacting with-in the Optimism eco-system. Most gaming projects have millions of dollars in their budget to develop games. Dope Wars DAO has been developing with far less than that eg Yuga labs raised $450 million to fund their development of building a metaverse. So we feel it is reasonable for Dope Wars to ask for 450K OP. ",

Now, back to topic:- From my last comment  treasury for a community based project development is not a good idea   What you are saying is, give us the 440K OP token, we will keep it our multi-sig and use it for dev, this means uncertainty. We dont know what you will build. Community owned project are hard to build, direction and pace can change anytime which give me more doubt. You are focusing more on \"development \" word in my sentence and that is wrong, I support Dev project and I pretty vocal about it but I need to see the goal along with a precise plan and a timeline. Reading POC and providing sing-off for funding is part of my 9-5 job and when I see your 4 line sentence, I see these things are missing and they are most important. Focus on  \u201ctreasury\u201d ,\" community based project\" and then \u201cdevelopment is not a good idea\u201d.  My suggestion would be to decide what you want to build, make plan for that, include how you see it will add value of OP ecosystem with a proper timeline and I will support you. Coping lines from proposal for reference.  will be sent to Dope Wars treasury to aid with development of games and smart contracts. Dope Wars DAO will utilize these funds in a responsible manner to allow Dope Wars to flourish into the communities vision. We are a community owned project so no external capital has been received and we have never sold treasury assets, only used them to fund development. This portion of the proposal will encourage builders to keep developing within Dope Wars. Inspiring new developers to join our Play to Own model and collectively produce many entertaining games.

This I understood, I read it through the link you have provided but that is your end product goal, something that you want to build. But you see how this proposal and other you are referring to is different. Without proper plan I cant support this, I would suggest you to make a plan and include the cost, dev cost, duration, infra and so on(I am not sure how you will do it as its your internal project matter and I should not comment on that). Once the plan is ready, I can comment on that but as of now, to me, its a black box. Other approach could be user on-boarding in one proposal and another detailed proposal for dev. ",

Step 2 will be a major factor here, you need to show the on-chain data. Focus on Mean-Test and connect it with no vc funding Not only I will join you in that battle as a Delegate but also a user.  next RPGF will be in next few month, just my guess, so its not that far.

Not only in this proposal but elsewhere. So let me grab this chance to write few words. RPGF is a nice additional help for an opensource project. But it\u2019s not a way to fund the development of any project in a sustainable way. You can\u2019t ask a project to do months of development work for free and then tell them that maybe if you are happy with what they do you will throw them some coins. This is not directed at you specifically but I feel the need to clarify what RPGF can and can\u2019t do \u2013 since many people seem to misunderstand. RPGF is a nice thing for public goods and tends to reward already recognized and successful projects. But if a project seeks funding for a set of milestones, RPGF is not the way to go. This statement comes from my own experience of running an opensource project since 2017 (first as side-project \u2013 and then full blown opensource company) and having taken part in many different retroactive funding experiments.

Hey @lefterisjp, I agree with you on this and I want to see some change here, software development and management is  resource intensive task and I hope with RPGF we can change people opinion on funding public good. But I also understand that it will not happen in first or second round, this will take time with iterative approach.  You can\u2019t ask a project to do months of development work for free and then tell them that maybe if you are happy with what they do you will throw them some coins.  Imo, this we can change with the help of result oracle, RPGF will focus more on impact and support the project accordingly not just some \u201ccoin\u201d but rather proper funding and support. I would like to see few public good reaching millions of people rather than focusing on multiple public at once and loosing traction at earlier stage and this we can avoid with proper funding. Again, from what I see and feel, we are early in this phase, DAO is broken in current form, if there is no incentive people are not willing to contribute and sometime I feel, we, the so called web3 space is gonna turn this initiative of \u201cpublic good\u201d into just \u201cgood\u201d because of greed.  RPGF is a nice thing for public goods and tends to reward already recognized and successful projects.  I dont agree with you on this one, I will apply Mean-Test here, successful projects might have other source of income/funding so we cant put them in same bucket with new project and/public good. Its not fair game and will raise this concern once we reach at that point.  This is not directed at you specifically but I feel the need to clarify what RPGF can and can\u2019t do \u2013 since many people seem to misunderstand.  Dont worry about this, I am only active here on this gov forum because I have some hope that we(Token house/citizen house) can make some change with DAO based governance and feedback and open communication are two pillar of that, so i appreciate your input. I wrote a few line on public good few days back, feel free to jump in with your thoughts. ",

Optimism is really gaining momentum in the NFT/metaverse space, and we haven\u2019t seen many proposals yet to help build that ecosystem. While I at first was taken aback by the large token ask for development, being that they are a community project those tokens will be shared with external contributors to incentivize project development and growth (from my understanding). There\u2019s a huge opportunity to put Optimism on the radar for NFT/metaverse/p2e gaming, so I think investing into a project like Dope Wars is the right thing to do at this juncture. I see so much criticism against DeFi projects using their OP tokens primarily for liquidity incentives, and here\u2019s a project that really is going to use the tokens to help build the ecosystem. Let\u2019s pass this and make Optimism a leader in the NFT space! ",

The project launched in September 2021 and there is only a non-functional \u201cswap meet\u201d dapp and some NFT and token assets. It is also unclear to me what OP stands to gain for funding the NFTs of this project, I checked on Quixotic and they have had barely any volume at all in weeks, so it does not appear that people are using or trading them. Would reconsider with a more modest proposal that requests a realistic amount of tokens and has a relevant pitch, for example it appears the game is supposed to be on Starknet, so why fund with OP tokens? I would like to see the team show more advanced development in order to be funded, we have no evidence that they are capable of delivering anything. Furthermore, I checked etherscan and it seems the Dope Wars DAO only has $130,000 worth of ETH, which displays a lack of effective fund management; no doubt this proposal was given such a ridiculous amount of OP because the Dope Wars project didn\u2019t manage their funds properly. I think there is a lot of work to be done to be worth voting yes on, I like the concept of the project but the extremely poor fund management, high expenses and no product delivery are big red flags. The point here is to fund something that benefits the Optimism ecosystem, and not simply to fund a microcap project that seems to be on shaky legs and not managing their funds in a responsible manner, for all we know they can squander the OP tokens they would be granted as they have with their existing funds. The high token amount requested seems to me like a cash grab to make up for crashed project assets (the Dope NFTs on opensea have no volume and very low floor price, the Quixotic NFTs have no volume, the token $PAPER is down 95%) and for poor fund management on part of the team, even if I like the concept of the game. The proposal must prove that the OP ecosystem benefits and that the project will manage the funds correctly, and that we know exactly what they will be used for (itemized expenses). I will vote yes if I see those improvements. ",

For anyone with questions about how we\u2019ve collectively voted to spend our treasury you can find a history of expenses here. I categorize and track each amount after a proposal is passed on-chain. It\u2019s bizarre that someone would target @mboyle specifically about his proposal, when we have multiple other proposals currently in-flight with deliverables due. Hopefully people familiar with developing products understand some things take longer than others to be delivered, for various reasons. I\u2019m currently working with @Butterbum on a revised proposal that is more specific to Optimism. In the meantime, I\u2019m also working with a small team to produce a proof-of-concept on-chain game using our assets on Optimism. With these things combined I believe our revised proposal will be more attractive to the OP DAO. Working in a DAO is a new concept for many of us, which is extremely difficult at times. Personally, I have not taken funds from the DAO for development while also trying to be main project lead, product manager, treasurer, and lead developer. In hindsight, this was probably a mistake that paused our growth for a few months. ",
