The Core Principles are certainly something I can support, and more importantly, what I have seen so far makes me optimistic that the community is actually striving to execute on those principles. I\u2019ve been reading a lot trying to get caught up, but many of the sources, including those linked one or two levels down from the governance front-end at vote.makerdao.com, are redundant or worse, out of date.  For example, under Governance, there\u2019s a long discussion of the Maker Foundation-- Maker Foundation | MakerDAO Community Portal --but I understand from a blog post last year-- \u00bb MakerDAO Has Come Full Circle \u2013 that the Foundation is being/has been dissolved.  Lot\u2019s of other tidbits here and there seem subtly (but importantly!) out of date. Could anyone point me to the best \u201cState of the DAO\u201d that I can use as a jumping off point as I keep reading up on things? Thanks! ",
