We just integrated Optimism and wanted to share here with the community. See below    karmahq.xyz   Optimism DAO Contributors Leaderboard This Optimism leaderboard shows the reputation score and contribution stats of leading contributors and delegates in the Optimism DAO      Each delegate also has a profile page showing all the DAOs they are involved in and their voting history and forum stats. Example: Linda\u2019s profile Each delegate has a reputation score we calculate based on their governance activity (voting on-chain, off-chain, forum discussions). Since Optimism governance hasn\u2019t started yet, we are calculating scores purely based on delegated votes. The score logic is all open source and is ideally decided by community. We request the core team+community to give us feedback on two things:  Feedback on this dashboard, what else would you like to see Feedback on algorithm you would like to use for calculating reputation scores of delegates  Hope the community finds this useful.
