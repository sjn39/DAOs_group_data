I\u2019d like to request a change to the way the DSR governance polling question is phrased. Currently we are being asked for the absolute values of the SCD SF, MCD SF and DSR Rate. I think it is more appropriate to ask for the MCD SF - DSR Spread to replace the DSR Rate poll. With this phrasing change it helps keep the two values as orthogonal as possible. DSR Spread adjusts for system growth/migration speed whereas MCD SF adjusts for DAI peg stability. This will also help us avoid a situation where for whatever reason the DSR mistakenly ends up being voted higher than the SF. I believe this issue may come up once we start having to change the SF for peg stability as there is a problem of coordinating the values of the DSR and MCD SF to move in tandem. It\u2019s not clear whether voters are signalling to increase/decrease the DSR spread or if they want to adjust for peg stability. IMO keeping the voting parameters as orthogonal as possible is essential for demonstrating voter intentions in the clearest way. EDIT Adding a vote as requested. Question: Should we switch the phrasing of the DSR governance poll from absolute DSR % to a MCD - DSR spread %?     Yes No     0 voters     ",

The risk team could tune the SF and DSR at any time without having to worry about a vote pushing the DSR much higher than the SF. If we do keep voting each week, then I\u2019ll change my vote on this signal request to yes for this reason you put above.     hexonaut:  a situation where for whatever reason the DSR mistakenly ends up being voted higher than the SF.   This makes sense and I 100% agree, I just don\u2019t think it will be necessary after the IAM are implemented. ",

It\u2019s because I believe it is a more natural fit to how we should be thinking about these parameters. As I said above we currently have two parameters to effect dai peg stability when it should be reduced to one for simplicity and clear signaling. With regards to the IAM, I think only the stability fee should be set each week with the DSR rate following it minus the spread parameter. The DSR spread should remain relatively constant because it effects growth/profit and not peg stability. Under this change and after migration I think we can simplify things down to 1 weekly poll of the global stability fee only. If we keep the DSR in terms of absolute rate we will almost certainly have to vote on 2 things week to week (the DSR and the global sf). ",

                    "content": "    hexonaut:   I don\u2019t see a problem with the DSR temporarily being higher than the weighted average SF. At the time of writing, only 20% of DAI is in the DSR so we have a lot of slack that we can use to our advantage.  The problem comes with the fact that you\u2019ve given vault owners a way to earn a guaranteed % return on their ETH stack. It may max out the debt ceiling pretty quickly.   OK, I\u2019ve been pondering this for a few days. Why is it necessarily a problem to provide a guaranteed return? What happens when we add ETH vaults with more limited leverage and lower SF? If the DSR is rigidly limited by the lowest SF for any asset type then we\u2019re artificially limiting our ability to govern effectively. If I take my ETH, open a vault, generate DAI, and deposit it in the DSR then I might extract 0.5% or 1% risk free, but I\u2019m also tieing up capital. It\u2019s not necessarily a great investment. Also, if DAI is trading below 1.0 then I think it could be worth temporarily raising the DSR above the weighted average SF to defend the peg. What we don\u2019t want to do ever again is to raise the SF to 20% to defend the peg. Vault owners just loathed that experience, adding injury to an already bitter bear market. ",

                    "content": "This is a fair counterpoint to having a 0% lower bound. My intuition is to not go below a 0% spread but this does not have to be a hard constraint. My main point is to switch to the spread model instead of the current absolute value model because it is a more natural fit to how we should think of these parameters in my opinion. Low volatility assets are an interesting new case I have started considering more recently. For example SAI would have to have a negative vault-type fee to counteract the global sf rate or nobody would borrow with it. I still think that overall our collateral portfolio will mostly be more volatile assets and as such a global sf of countering bull/bear behaviour in the market as a whole should be dominating over something like having a USD analogue as a collateral type and focusing on that edge case.
