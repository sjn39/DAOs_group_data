The answer when I asked - no way to own it and no way to control embezzlement.  The embezzlement part, I would think one could set up something that required 3 or more people (or smart contracts) to \u201ckey\u201d a sale or transfer.  The ownership part is a puzzle with an autonomous organization.  And I think the question becomes are MKR holders willing to cross the line to have some entity form so that those kind of asset purchases could be done. Arca Labs was trying to do a tokenized interest in a T-Bill fund, maybe they have been successful, but a fund is not what we would want because an interest in it would lose value as interest rates went up. Because the USDC in the PSM represents collateral backing DAI we wouldn\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t burn MKR bought that way, it would have to be held, and MKR is a bit (!) more volatile than USDC.  Nice idea though - if there was a valid way to burn MKR I\u2019m for it. ",

Main problem with other protocol is the contract risk or get the found stolen by the admin. So due to the high risk of \u201cgoing on chain to off chain\u201d we are not taking more risk by having RWA around the BB mark and reward are better around 2%. Basically : low + medium risk is medium. Medium + medium is still medium. Also we can easily archive the 0.1% from the bond , empty the PSM and going into negative peg by changing Eth-a rate to 0.1% but we will lose money on fees. Because it is better to have a 3% on half of our supply than a 0.1% on the full supply. One solution is to put eth-c to 0.5% and hoping to keep a relatively high level of usage on Eth-a. ",

You can\u2019t maintain the Dai price between 1.001 and 0.99 constantly with the DSR or the rate changes. So we need the PSM in the upward because there is no other way to keep the 0.001 range with the other tools.   Just to add a slightly different opinion to this, if it weren\u2019t for the PSM, DAI would now be at $1.04 or something like that. So we do need a bulldozer tool, namely a rate cut. The PSM\u2019s job is to tune out minor fluctuations but is instead being seen as the only tool to restore the peg. The problem with DAI right now is a clear case of demand exceeding supply and a rate cut is the most sensible option. I also strongly disagree with the notion that we should take the fees we can get while we can even if it means increasing our existential risk to USDC. For me, it\u2019s not the worst idea to drop all rates to 0% and let the market go wild with vaults. Yes it cuts our earnings but gives DAI supply a huge boost. This is the idea of the Maker summer party but I think it doesn\u2019t go far enough. The issue we have with playing with rates is that the last time we were in this situation was post-Black Thursday. At that point, trust in the protocol itself had been lost and people didn\u2019t open vaults, even when rates were at 0%. This led to a belief that rate cuts were insufficient to boost DAI supply. I think we are now in a very different situation and would strongly encourage drastic rate cuts, at least on a trial basis for a few months. Yes, it kills our earnings in the short term but that\u2019s a preferable solution for me (as a MKR holder) compared to piling on more USDC in the PSM. ",

                    "content": "Hi folx, I wanted to share my perspective on investing USDC held in the PSM. While it would be great to earn additional income from this collateral, there are serious drawbacks to the available investments. Our immediate options for USDC can be broken down into two categories: lending (eg. Aave, Compound, Circle Yield, etc) and stablecoin AMMs (Curve, Uniswap v3, etc). Yearn vaults and other strategies generally represent a mix of these two yield sources. Lending - All else equal, supplying USDC to lending platforms like Aave or Compound will lead to lower borrowing rates on these platforms. Borrowers currently using Maker\u2019s crypto collateralized vaults will have an incentive to refinance their loans to take advantage of lower rates. This will reduce DAI supply, placing further pressure on the PSM and forcing MakerDAO to lower rates to remain competitive. Circle\u2019s Yield product for USDC term deposits will have a similar effect - funds are lent out to crypto lending desks, and this liquidity ultimately competes with Maker\u2019s crypto vaults and pushes down borrowing rates. Stablecoin AMMs - Automated market makers price assets based on the relative quantity of supplied funds within a pool. For example, if we supplied the PSM\u2019s USDC to Curve, the DAI supplied to Curve would need to increase by a similar amount to maintain a stable price peg. This increase in DAI demand would counteract the benefits of the PSM and likely lead to even more USDC exposure. For both lending and AMM investments, using the USDC to earn yield causes increasing supply/demand imbalance and has the potential to cannibalize MakerDAO\u2019s core vault lending revenues. So while I\u2019d love to earn more on this pool of assets I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic. To reduce risk for USDC collateral and increase risk compensation, I think we should focus on the following areas instead of direct USDC investments: Interest rate reductions - The PPG-OMC-1 rates proposal group has already recommended sizable rate cuts for our crypto vault types, which are live for an executive vote here. We can pursue further rate cuts depending on how the markets respond to these initial changes. Over time this should help increase DAI supply and reduce USDC held in the PSM. New PSMs for other stablecoins - The community is considering adding additional PSMs for other stablecoins. Based on an initial signal request, it seems the community favors accepting BUSD, PAX, and GUSD. This will allow Maker to diversify its credit and counterparty risk among multiple issuers, helping address the negative perception of DAI becoming a USDC wrapper. Offering additional PSMs can also help Maker increase our \u201ctrading income\u201d from PSM fees. Instead of only offering trading between DAI and USDC, we\u2019ll now be able to offer trading between all of the PSM supported stablecoins, including trades that only use DAI as a bridging asset (eg. USDC<>PAX). Trading fees will likely remain low but could see some improvement versus the current state. New large cap collateral assets - Adding support for high potential crypto collaterals can help us meet DAI demand without as much reliance on fiat stablecoins. Top potential additions include Sushiswap LPs, xSUSHI, stETH, Curve LPs, and certain other large cap cryptos. Real world asset (RWA) backed lending - While it will take time to scale this up, this offers a vast potential source of DAI supply that can help us reduce reliance on USDC while earning a better risk adjusted return. I like the idea of investing funds into off chain cash assets like US treasury securities in principle, but this is unlikely to work in the current low rate environment because the additional custody risks and costs will outweigh any yield earned.

This increase in DAI demand would counteract the benefits of the PSM and likely lead to even more USDC exposure.   one thing that I\u2019ll say about this that might not be currently taken into account is that if Maker were to pursue some option like that I think you might be able to reduce your blacklist risk. Expanding on that from my understanding the main risk in all of these stablecoins really boils down to one of two things that may one day happen   Insolvency risk / Counterparty Risk - eventually an actor would no longer be redeem said stablecoin for actual 1 USD.  Blacklist Risk - the stablecoin issuer (or potentially some external entity strong-arming the stablecoin issuer) decides that they don\u2019t like what is going on with the PSM and then blacklists the PSM contract such that the stablecoin stored there cannot be withdrawn.  Not much maker can do about insolvency, but in moving all this collateral to a AMM you shift the later risk a bit. This is because blacklisting means that major trading venues effectively get shutdown. As I see it you basically can adopt a MAD doctrine in regard to the asset held such that both parties will incur loss of trust in their respective collateral if blacklisting is enacted. Which would mitigate your risk to some degree, but admittedly its hard to quantify. ",

This increase in DAI demand would counteract the benefits of the PSM and likely lead to even more USDC exposure.   I\u2019m not sure this is entirely correct (or more, it is correct, but it\u2019s incomplete.) If we did take the PSM USDC and drop into into curve or UniV3 1-sided, then yes, we increase the pressure on the peg, and nullify the action. However, what we can actually do here is mint an amount of DAI equal to the amount of USDC in the PSM and put both into an AMM and take the LP/NFT tokens as collateral. Although this minted DAI may seem unbacked, it is still owned by the Maker Protocol, and it can only be accessed by other entities via depositing USDC in the AMM in exchange for DAI. Thus, any DAI that enters circulation becomes backed by the USDC that is exchanged for it - until that point it is owned by the protocol and is net-neutral to the balance sheet. In practice this means that we take Curve LP or UniV3 LP tokens as collateral which does result in the blacklist risk being one step removed from the Maker Protocol and allows us to collect fees on AMM trades. The negative effect here is that in the event of emergency shutdown, it becomes more awkward for users to redeem DAI for the underlying assets (due to the need for recursive redemptions) but DAI Holders can still access $1 worth of value for each DAI they hold.

Agree, but this doesn\u2019t solve \u201cadditional yield on USDC held in PSM\u201d part which people addressed in this thread, because PSM already fulfils it equally or more efficiently? It does however help with blacklisting risk, so maybe its worth it for that reason alone. We\u2019d probably still prefer a combination of minimizing blacklist risks and making additional yield compared to what is already there with PSM, but as @monet-supply explained there are limits to it or second order negative effects.

Presumably this is allow them to match up maturities in their liabilities (USDC) and assets. We basically give turn their short term liabilities into long term ones now, though of uncertain length. I would like to find out \u2014 and I believe is already being done \u2014 if Circle would pay us similar rates to lock up our USDC. Even if it was simply for the 1-month rate (4% at the moment), we could ladder the entire PSM with 1/30th of it rolling over each day, just as an example. How could they take our word for it, or us theirs? Make a SC that they put USDC or DAI in as premium, we put it in as collateral, and it has a time lock on it. I think the biggest issue is if they or anyone else (like Ledn) requires KYC. @omahalawyer and I have been casually brainstorming a bit, and there\u2019s probably a way to do that if we really wanted to.

Well we can certainly try asking them (I am looking for contacts actually), but I don\u2019t believe we are able to get meaningful yield for the amounts we are talking about here. They are likely lending USDC/USD to Genesis and other players (maybe even farm within DeFi?), so there\u2019s some counterparty risk involved as well, not to mention KYC problem. I am sure they don\u2019t offer 4-5% rates by investing USD in legacy safe assets.

For me, it\u2019s not the worst idea to drop all rates to 0% and let the market go wild with vaults. Yes it cuts our earnings but gives DAI supply a huge boost. This is the idea of the Maker summer party but I think it doesn\u2019t go far enough.   I\u2019m not convinced that even dropping rates to zero would have the desired effect, though it would of course help. Is there a discussion somewhere of all the different ways that users might be encouraged to generate Dai to increase supply? ",

I believe there has to be some sort of arrangement that would be in both Maker\u2019s and Circle\u2019s best interests. Certainly, Circle is going to have the know-how, contacts, and framework (regulatory and otherwise) to deploy their stable coins to produce income that would take us a prohibitive amount of time to develop in the near-future. And it\u2019s in their interest too as evidenced by the fact that they are promoting this in order to create new revenue streams and generate demand for their coin. I do not think they could afford to say \u2018no\u2019 to working with us to fill whatever their liquidity needs are that prompted this project in the first place. As noted:     PaperImperium:  Given that we now have ~10% of all USDC, I wonder if we could just ask USDC to remit us part of the interest they earn on the fiat backing it. I\u2019m sure they couldn\u2019t cough up $2.4 billion if we tried to redeem.   IMHO as long as we are in this USDC quagmire, as we seemingly will be for the immediate future, there aren\u2019t really any additional risks to \u201cbanking\u201d with Circle. And there are definitely fewer risks than keeping our USDC balance and depositing it on any other DeFi platform. In the latter case, cross-party risk is between two parties; in the former, multiple (even if they are working with Genesis &c, we\u2019re pretty much assuming the risk of Circle\u2019s failure anyway). I am exceedingly interested to know what Circle can come to the table with as I imagine it is a lot. And it needn\u2019t necessarily be lending. I wonder what they can do if we can lock up, say, $1M each day for a 90-day period over a course of some months or years, thus freeing capital on their end. Essentially, lending to Circle themselves.
