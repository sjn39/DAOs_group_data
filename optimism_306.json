For example, if a wallet completes the quest(s), and has no organic transactions after, then this should be excluded from drop 2 because they\u2019re clearly just coming for handouts. As a long time user of Optimism, I feel pressured to do the Quests because of the presumption it will be used for drop 2, but I\u2019ve already used the majority of protocols live on OP, and done most of the tasks organically so am not about to jump through a set of hoops for an NFT to say so. Wouldn\u2019t it have made sense for past transactions to be eligible? Quest is a good idea to get people bridging and trying out OP, I just hope that existing users doing many natural txs will not be snubbed by not completing it. I am not against giving Quest completooors any OP. Just dont waste it. Also please decentralize the sequencer. Thanks. nb. I am aware this probably come across as \u2018muuuh make airdrop requirements to what my wallet does\u2019, but all you have to do to see the general attitude of questooors is go to any protocols discord and look at all the posts saying \u2018I did the task wen nft, can i withdraw now\u2019. I have seen very little posts like \u2018hey this protocol is cool how does it work\u2019. ",

But we all understand it\u2019s OK for someone coming and completing that job to be rewarded. Some % of them will leave, but some others may stay around. My point is: Is that a useful job for gaining long-term users on OP ecosystem? I don\u2019t think so, but I understand we are too early and there are just a few apps.     OPUser:  If a user wants to complete all the quest then they need around $800ish in their wallet and if their primary goal is to complete all OPQ on multiple wallet then most likely they will use the same fund by moving it to different wallet.   I don\u2019t know well what happened by airdrop 1, but in this case you have a point: Completing the quest requires so much work, not like bridging from ETH to OP that can be done super fast.     OPUser:  And just to clarify, I am not speculating airdrop, Sybil is a bigger problem which need some brainstorming and I thought these quest might help us with that.   +1 no caring or speculating about the airdrop. Anyone, not selling must think about the long-term and sustainability. I respect everyone\u2019s choice, but I am not on crypto for trading or to end up with more fiat. I am here for a long way towards decentralization. Sybil\u2019s attack is not an easy problem to solve. I like some approaches like this one I need to look more into : https://coinpassport.net/  but I think the hash input must be large and hard to guess and the trusted party must be decentralized. Vitalik has written about it several times. A social recovery wallet\u2026 So much exited work to do after season 2 ends. ",

But I knw wat ur saying that one shudnt get unnoticed or b un eligible for not doing the quests n stuff but those individuals that u say u seen just posting those comments don\u2019t mean that everyone who does the quests have that same mentality/idea. What would be some possible solutions that the OP or anyone in general should do for what u r pointing out here? I would like to knw more tho cuz I try to be involved but sometimes I\u2019m not able too cuz of wrk n all but we try u knw. Do u think if the OP team gives less priority to those only doing the quests for an airdrop n give more to those who complete tasks n go based on the number of tasks they complete make them eligible for it?

Hi, So far I just have only the Uniswap NFT, because I needed to swap. I like your idea. I have played some games with tokens and addresses and it can be fun and educative (I won\u2019t burn an OP token though haha). The thing is that airdrops are massive and must have a well-tested and efficient method. And most importantly: in a game theoretical way so airdrops are for the people most likely to contribute to the ecosystem. My advice is to enjoy building or supporting OP with the thing you love to do most. ",

Just wanted to add my 2 GWEI brainstorming possible ways to modify the criteria to filter out airdrop farmers, in an equitable way\u2026 Add a multiplier factor to any Quest airdrop allocation - e.g., the amount of gas you used on optimism, the number of days (within a period) that you transacted on optimism. For example, if 2 wallets completed all quest tasks, but the first one only did the quest tasks on optimism and the 2nd also \u2018organically\u2019 continued to use optimism, than the 2nd wallet should get more quest-airdrop OP allocated. Sybil farmers will likely only be doing quest tasks and that\u2019s it. If you used/spent 10x more gas or 10x the number of transactions or days using optimism, then you should get more than someone who just put in the minimum. You could also use the median or mean wallet\u2019s gas usage/# of days, as a reference/baseline to normalize to. tl;dr I think rewarding optimism gas usage is a fair and relatively more organic metric that is not easily gamed, and the gas (aka fees paid) directly helps optimism, so it\u2019s a good thing to incentivize.

TLDR on this side of things: giving out OP to armies of people who simply farm NFT\u2019s is a very bad idea. There\u2019s nothing more to it than that. Please don\u2019t do this. Instead of focusing on collecting small NFT\u2019s, what protocols need is support from the Optimism Foundation in areas such as development, marketing, fundraising, and growth. The Optimism Foundation can then connect protocols with the right partners for integrations. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with folks at Optimism on this - Binji, Scifer, and the other people I\u2019ve worked with on the Synthetix side who have been instrumental in bringing new protocols to Optimism and setting them up.

In this case, it is advisable to use a metric tied to a non-zero balance for a certain period of time. For example, counting the weeks in which the user has more than $50 in his wallet (in equivalent). The main thing is to find the right balance between what the average user can own and how much the sibyl can afford to keep on all her wallets at the same time. This criterion cannot be used alone. However, it can be used to identify suspicious addresses, and then, in combination with other criteria, draw a final conclusion. ",
