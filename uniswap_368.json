Was this a moderator hiding my post or just because people flagged it? I feel if someone identifies themselves and doesnt remain anonymous, they leave themselves open to public criticism through news articles. But thats ok, if the mods believe it violated a rule, no problem. However if it was hidden purely from being flagged by users, this raises the question of raids and opinion manipulation on here. So that would be yet another reason to vet new users or at least have flagged posts manually reviewed, say weekly, by mods. ",
