On one hand, they feel a bit shady to me, perhaps because they move toward a two-tier network where some people have an unfair advantage over others.  One might counter that the service is available to anyone who is willing to pay for it, but it still doesn\u2019t feel very good. On the other hand, they provide a valuable service by solving a problem (frontrunning) for users. ",

One could argue that nodes in one geographic location next to a mining pool is acceptable, even though it is a \u201cgeographic local network\u201d Then this begs the question: where do we draw the line? Not easy to answer. So although I do use the public mempool, I cannot find fault in private mempools ",
