I like the thought but this would likely need to be made narrower (ie restricted to a single pool to start, eventually a short list) in order to be considered. Impermanent loss would be a major problem for less liquid and/or more volatile pairs in evaluating LP tokens as collateral. It\u2019s not very \u201cimpermanent\u201d at the moment of a liquidation event. Even for more liquid/less volatile pairs, modeling risk due to IL is a complex topic. ",
