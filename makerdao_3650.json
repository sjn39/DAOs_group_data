                    "content": "There seems to be a general lack of clarity about who Maker Protocol\u2019s vault users are, and how they use our product. I\u2019m in the middle of chasing down some data on long-run profitability and margins, as well as beginning to discuss how vaults behave after liquidation. Here are some quick facts about where the (as of writing) 4.97 billion DAI come from: ~15% come from just 1 user ~25% come from just 5 users ~31% come from just 15 vaults ~35% come from the top 5 vaults in each of our 7 largest vault types 54% come from just 1 vault type (ETH-A) 16% come from the PSM ~69% come from the 3 largest vault types that aren\u2019t stablecoins (ETH-A, WBTC-A, ETH-C) ETH-A is the only large type where the top 5 vaults are not a majority of all DAI issued: ETH-A \u2013 37.8% WBTC \u2013 66.7% ETH-C \u2013 85.5% LINK \u2013 87% YFI \u2013 93.9% ETH-B \u2013 55% UNIV2DAIETH \u2013 98.2% Over the life of a each vault type (with the exception of ETH-A), the average vault tends to provide in the neighborhood of 25x times the fees of the median vault: ETH-A \u2013 Median 3.05; Average 1596.16 WBTC \u2013 Median 105.95; Average 2757.51 ETH-C \u2013 Median 39.30; Average 1826.55 LINK \u2013 Median 37.65; Average 1535.71 YFI \u2013 Median 103.02; Average 2724.24 ETH-B \u2013 Median 51.23; Average 2664.13 UNIV2DAIETH \u2013 Median 35.88; Average 1101.96 Why even read this? This is a multi-billion-dollar enterprise. It\u2019s important we understand how our product is being used. This is definitely not a substitute for a deep dive into these numbers. But it is a beginning for understanding. Some data pulled from the Token Flow beta GUI and the rest kindly provided by @tmierzwa ",
