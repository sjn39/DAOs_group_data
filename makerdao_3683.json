Link \u201cTrust based\u201d project 6s gets closer to Maker approval Not all RWAs are onboarded to DeFi via Tinlake and the Centrifuge model \u2013 6s, a project in the works since Sep \u201820 is now one step closer to becoming the first onboarded by leveraging a legal structured based on a Delaware Trust, instead of a SPV, as they pass the Core Units contract review with \u201cno critical issue\u201d. Link BizDev lead at Maker leaves to help loan originators onboard to Maker Greg Di Prisco, as of last week ex BizDev lead at Maker, announced that he is leaving Maker now that it has become more decentralised, and is instead starting RWA Co, a \u201ccompany to bridge the gap between the legacy credit markets and MakerDAO\u201d. 6s will be the first project using RWA Co. Link Maker passes Black Wednesday stress test with flying colors Despite a 56% drop in the price of ETH, Maker functioned nominally and continued burning MKR (in fact, increasing the pace) \u2013 a clear improvement from Black Thursday and a testament to the anti-fragility of Maker. Link MakerDAO is now a real DAO Although it happened earlier this month, it is big enough to warrant a mention. As the final piece of the decentralisation puzzle, the centralised Maker Foundation sent ~$400m (84k MKR) to the DAO and will spend the resources left on dissolving itself. The decentralisation experiment continues. Link   ",

He\u2019s now selling the property in the world\u2019s first auction with a real estate-backed NFT. Bidding for the NFT starts on June 8 with a starting price of $20,000. Link  US farmland is coming to DeFi Peoples Company, a land brokerage firm, is continuing on its path to onboard US farmland into DeFi. The Maker risk team has suggested a 5-year facility at 2%, which Peoples Company will use to finance purchases of actual land. Pretty cool. Link  All Tinlake projects planned to onboard to Maker in June pass engineering review Peoples Company (US farmland), Fortunafi (revenue based financing), Harbor Trade Credit (supply chain financing) and ConsoleFreight all passed engineering review and are therefore still expected to be onboarded onto Maker in June. Link  Oversubscribed $20m Centrifuge token sale Despite a significantly tougher crypto market than just a few weeks ago, Centrifuge\u2019s token sale was significantly oversubscribed \u2013 not unlikely related to the 100% month-on-month growth seen in Tinlake and the strong pipeline for the upcoming months.
