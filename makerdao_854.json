                    "content": " Aligning Governance and MKR Holders  Proposal Two: Increasing voter engagement and alignment through a new MKR vesting bonus system for delegates and voters; reduced voting requirements based on enabling more operational flexibility to the Core Units within community-prescribed limits; and creating a new MakerDAO governance dashboard via a community grant. Stanford Political Economy professor Andy Hall wrote an excellent post highlighting some of the key DAO governance challenges throughout the web3 landscape: generating incentive alignment among different stakeholders, maximizing participation, and proactively building an informed electorate. (1) Incentive Alignment: one idea to address incentive alignment among the MakerDAO workforce, MKR delegates, and MKR holders (the actors involved in the two layers of principal-agent relationships @Andrew_Hall referenced) is to reward both regular voters and official delegates with a vesting bonus denominated in MKR tokens based on MakerDAO\u2019s long-term performance and their cumulative activity. This idea bears some similarities to MIP49, which recommended a form of incentive alignment with voters based on staking yields proportional to the financial performance of the protocol, and also the active MKR Compensation MIP, which institutes retroactive vesting rewards. Initially, these tokens could be set aside on MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet as a reserve vesting pool. Similar to the MKR tokens used by MakerDAO to reward full-time contributors, these tokens could be awarded over 18-36 month intervals based on a publicly-voted formula similar to the delegate compensation model. Top contributors would receive MKR rewards on a quarterly basis, but could only cash out much later based on maintaining performance standards and continued activity. This pilot project could also tie in objective external performance criteria as a metric. Importantly, the vesting pool could be designed to reward smaller holders at significantly higher relative rates versus large holders. Putting a relatively low ceiling on the amount of tokens subject to vesting rewards would prevent large holders from receiving disproportionate rewards at the expense of smaller holders, who this proposal is designed to incentivize. (2) Participation: There are various pros and cons to weigh regarding a possible Curve-inspired \u201cveToken\u201d model application to MakerDAO, as Parafi recently proposed. There could be some benefits to rewarding long-term participants with more voting power; however, @NikKunkel and @monet-supply both raised excellent counterpoints against implementation of the proposal as written. If there were to be a \u201cgbMKR\u201d implementation, the max lock-up could be much shorter (likely one year) and economic incentives may need to be baked in (maybe by incorporating the \u201cgbMKR\u2019\u2019 model into the Secondary Surplus Buffer idea). For now, more data and community debate would be necessary before incorporating a \u201cgbMKR\u201d model, in case the perceived benefits may not outweigh the potential risks. In the meantime, a more near-term focus could be to reduce the number of referendum-style votes by redefining the parameters that core units can openly operate within. For example, MakerDAO already allows core units to complete tasks based on certain polls passing (i.e. if onboarding a new collateral type, the Risk Core Unit conducts a Risk Collateral Assessment). There could be room for more flexibility in specific tasks that shouldn\u2019t require a vote as long as the changes remain within prescribed limits, thereby eliminating any \u201cmanagerial decision making\u201d on the part of the Core Unit. One possibility would be allowing automatic changes to the System Surplus Buffer (again, within set limits) if it\u2019s tied to other data sources. So if the system\u2019s capital-at-risk increases by $10M, then the System Surplus Buffer automatically increases by $10M as well, and vice versa. Multisigs with enumerated authorizations could also be set up through executive votes. (3) Information and Expertise: one item that could be especially helpful to the community is a new governance dashboard that clearly shows the linear flow for proposals, provides links with details to discussions (the forum is byzantine for experienced users, let alone new ones), and organizes topics in a manner that any newcomer can understand. This dashboard could even directly link to the voting portal. The forums are terrific for in-depth discussions on specific topics, but they are tough to navigate as an organized discourse for governance. The community could create a \u201cMaker Burn\u201d-style site for governance that provides immediate clarity for major proposals, shows progress on governance initiatives, and shares background information for new entrants to quickly onboard. The current governance spreadsheet and MakerDAO governance flowchart are a great start, but there\u2019s room to improve it for everyone. MakerDAO could offer a community grant to the best proposal, or sponsor a competition with retroactive prizes for the top implementation (as voted on by the community). Other DeFi protocols have gone this route with varying levels of success, but given the deep technical expertise embedded in the MakerDAO community, there are probably community members capable of creating a terrific product if the funding arrangement for their contributions is clear.

Then, how might we further \u201cscale\u201d professional governance via increasing token holder interest in and engagement with the responsibilities of delegation, not only via their own direct voting? It is great that we encourage more individuals and teams who can bring a significant contribution of time, skills and specific expertise via Delegate Compensation. Let\u2019s also consider the supply side of MKR engaged in delegation and how to make the proposition more attractive. I have seen comments that suggest dissatisfaction with how/where reasons for votes are communicated. Some have expressed a desire for us to communicate about our own views on vision and strategic direction. There\u2019s probably a role for any new governance dashboard or UI displays to make it much easier for us to communicate and for the community to better understand at a glance the overall point-of-view, biases, vision, policy preferences, etc. about a particular delegate and not just reasons for specific votes. This kind of clarity and transparency should help increase delegated MKR which ensures ample supply for an increasing number of Recognized Delegates to maximize compensation. ",
