Yes Optimism native?: No Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Currently Deployed Ecosystem Value Proposition: Curve is the backbone of the burgeoning DeFi industry. It touches every piece of the stack and strengthens every integrated protocol. There is opportunity for Optimism to leverage Curve\u2019s foundational role to further support its vibrant ecosystem. Applications integrated into Curve have realized novel use cases. Synthetix heavily utilizes Curve for synth liquidity. Their atomic swap functionality recently integrated with Curve has produced staggering revenues for Synthetix stakers. The stableswap algorithm, well known for enabling deep liquidity and low slippage swaps, has built a reputation for stabilizing pegs and enhancing stablecoin utility. See: FRAX, 3CRV Curve has a number of integrations with lending markets and yield bearing derivatives. Swap fees compound the interest generated from these activities. See: Aave, stETH Highly configurable V2 pools are unlocking new potential for FX markets and volatile crypto pairs. The concentrated liquidity algorithm offers advantages to LPs and traders, combining a composable AMM design with low slippage swaps. See: Tricrypto, eursusd Curve also needs Optimism. A recent Delphi article demonstrated that although Curve regularly quotes better pricing than competitors, it underperforms on volume due to mainnet gas costs. Curve requires a scalable L2 where it can absorb liquidity and realize its potential. Optimism is the ideal partner in this regard. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No Number of OP tokens requested: 504,828 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: In Process If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: Undetermined, in process How much will your project match in co-incentives? The distribution method will ensure that Curve matches incentives with its own emissions. As will be explained in the token distribution section, OP will be used as vote incentives to pay veCRV voters who gauge weight Optimism pools. While not possible to predict the dollar value of emissions from this strategy, historically >$1 of emissions are produced from $1 of reward deposits. It is commonly considered a capital efficient way to attract TVL, and would create a market dynamic that guarantees Curve will be offering co-incentives. Additionally, a virtuous cycle is created from the bootstrapping phase. Increased incentives attract LPs \u2192 Influx of liquidity stimulates utility of Optimism pools \u2192 Utility incentivizes veCRV to more heavily weight those pools \u2192 Incentives attract more LPs to Optimism. Curve\u2019s inflation schedule takes place over the course of ~250 years, so Optimism can be confident that there are many years of incentives ahead. Proposal for token distribution: How will the OP tokens be distributed? 100% of OP will be distributed as vote incentives for veCRV voters who direct CRV emissions toward Optimism pools. Curve Gauge  veTokenomics, first implemented by Curve, give vote locked tokenholders control over directing inflationary token emissions. A popular strategy used by many protocols is to exchange their native token for Curve emissions to their pools. The OP will be distributed in much the same way, offered as incentives for \u201cgauge weighting\u201d. Curve uses a gauge weight mechanism, the process which directs CRV emissions. Pools receive a gauge by passing an on-chain DAO vote. veCRV owning governance participants vote weekly on where to allocate inflation, which may be pools on any network, including Optimism. Each week, the RootChainGauge on Ethereum mints all CRV emissions of the previous week and transfers them over the Optimism bridge where they are received to a ChildChainGauge contract deployed to the same address. After checkpointing, they are transferred to the ChildGaugeFactory, the contract which handles distribution to all gauges on Optimism.     Contract Name Contract Address     ChildGaugeFactory 0xabC000d88f23Bb45525E447528DBF656A9D55bf5    This decentralized mechanism for rewards distribution distributes CRV to LPs. There are currently five pools with gauge on Optimism (sUSD, sETH, sBTC, 3pool, and FraxBP), although the number of pools and opportunities for LPs will be increasing over time. Current Optimism Gauges Eligible for Incentives:     Pool Name Gauge Contract     sUSD 0xc5aE4B5F86332e70f3205a8151Ee9eD9F71e0797   sETH 0xCB8883D1D8c560003489Df43B30612AAbB8013bb   sBTC 0x172a5AF37f69C69CC59E748D090a70615830A5Dd   3pool 0x15F52286C0FF1d7A7dDbC9E300dd66628D46D4e6   FRAXBP 0x4B960396011A914B4ccCC3b33DFEE83A97A9D766    Votium  Votium is the most widely used service for participating in Curve vote incentives. Depositers can deposit a reward token and specify a specific gauge. Then, during each gauge weight round, CVX and veCRV tokenholders who voted for that gauge can claim their portion of the reward. Although this process has always taken place on mainnet, the Votium team has agreed to deploy their contracts to Optimism so that OP can be distributed on its native network. They generate a merkle proof from votes cast, so can easily determine the correct value each voter is entitled to, and therefore voters simply claim rewards from their Optimism address. Votium contracts deployed to Optimism:     Pool Name Gauge Contract     Gnosis Safe 0x3A84A0517F3175c0F84ac98DDF5045418D751fdd   Deposit address 0x3299Ef424fd225f07eF614B4C9E8a591490Fb564   Fee address 0x5F9f852d3B04c22a43B44EaC364c91252882C7e8   Merkle Distributor 0xA4cdaCBf6cD74eaFBB785064B03B9eD11ec377ff   Merkle Controller 0x25E39DE2678C59983738134d8DA1953D0191e53F    Distribution Plan  We plan to deposit OP each week as vote incentives to veCRV voters on Votium Optimism. The weekly allotment will be 42,069 OP/week for 12 weeks. The recipient address is a L2 vault smart contract deployed as part of Curve\u2019s cross-chain governance system. Tokens sent to this vault are controlled by veCRV voters on mainnet via on-chain governance, making use of Optimism\u2019s own messaging bridge to relay the data. Funds sent to the contract are only accessible by Curve DAO. A distribution contract will be deployed that trustlessly carries out the following strategy. This strategy will be initiated using the cross-chain governance system. The OP rewards will be evenly divided between all existing gauges and deposited each week as vote incentives to Votium Optimism. If a new gauge is added to the gauge controller, it will be added to the distribution in the following weekly cycle. There are currently 5 gauges on Optimism, so each would receive 8,413.8 OP/week of incentives. If a new gauge is voted in, making a total of 6 gauges, each would receive 7,011.5 OP in the next cycle. The median Votium incentives toward CVX in the last 5 bribe rounds has been ~$50k-90k/week by protocol. At current valuation (October 13,2022), the proposed incentive amounts to ~$33k/week, putting it slightly below the median. We expect to see an influx of LPs from mainnet to Optimism as gauge weighting shifts toward Optimism pools as a result of these incentives. Note that the proposed strategy for receiving and distributing OP never involves custody of funds by Curve team, some other admin, or any multisig. Management is handled entirely by Curve DAO and the use of trustless smart contracts. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Curve\u2019s stableswap AMM excels for pools involving like-kind assets. LP\u2019s are attracted to these pools as a way to earn real yield from swap fees, while mitigating the risk of impermanent loss (as assets supplied to Curve pools are expected to be mean reverting). This is an expectation of increased assets bridged to Optimism, largely stablecoins, as LPs seek superior yield opportunities on Curve. Users trust the design, implementation, and security of Curve\u2019s contracts. Curve has been live on mainnet since early 2020, and has subsequently expanded to a number of side-chains and L2\u2019s. Its system is robust and battletested. Thanks to the integrity of its team and its brand, Optimism will surely see LP\u2019s onboard en masse to its incentivized pools. Once onboarded, the goal is to retain LPs on Optimism. Early converts incentivized with a stake in the network are more likely to express long term loyalty toward Optimism. Curve LPs are power users, some of the most capable at traversing the DeFi landscape. Whereas most protocols regard liquidity as mercenary, Curve has found an enduring alignment with its LPs, largely thanks to veTokenomics. Optimism has this opportunity to make allies of the best DeFi has to offer. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Curve\u2019s value proposition has not only attracted individual depositors, but has spawned new categories of DeFi application as protocols build their services around Curve. When these applications establish themselves, liquidity becomes anchored on Curve.   Use case 1: Synthetix and Curve have a deeply intertwined history that began with the need for Synthetix to offer low-slippage exposure to their sTokens. The partnership eventually expanded with the ability to accomplish cross-asset swaps using a combination of Curve and Synthetix. Now atomic swaps are fully realizing this functionality. For example, a user might swap USDC \u2192 sUSD on Curve, sUSD \u2192 sETH on Synthetix, and sETH \u2192 ETH on Curve, all in a single transaction. This is a powerful tool for LPs, who can provide liquidity in a single token without exposure to impermanent loss. Both Curve and Synthetix are seeing a surge in volumes thanks to this functionality.   Use case 2: Yearn was one of the first protocols built on Curve with their Y pool. They essentially invented the yield aggregator that kicked off the farming craze of 2020. Their service involves accepting user stablecoin deposits and optimizing yield on those assets across several lending applications (later expanding to a variety of other strategies). Its viability depends on Curve\u2019s deep liquidity and the assurance that their users can withdraw their stables without suffering impermanent loss. This use case was simply not possible before Curve.   Use case 3: Lido has chosen Curve as the source of liquidity for their liquid staked ETH derivative, stETH. Their service involves accepting user deposits of ETH and staking them on the ETH2 beacon chain. While deposits are temporarily locked before the merge, the stETH pool allows depositors to exit their position back to ETH. The deep liquidity and composability offered by Curve\u2019s stableswap AMM made it an excellent choice for Lido\u2019s integration.   From these examples, it is evident that Curve is foundational to the DeFi ecosystem. It does not exist in isolation, but rather as a building block for novel use cases. Once those applications establish themselves, liquidity becomes firmly cemented within Curve, ultimately becoming the fuel that powers the Optimism flywheel. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? The distribution will take place over 12 weeks (42,069 OP will be distributed weekly for the total of 504,828 OP).  Feedback Summary from Discussion (Oct. 13, 2022)  feedback in bold, followed by author\u2019s response The proposed 5 month distribution is too short, should increase duration. The proposed 1,000,000 OP is too much, should decrease requested amount. The proposal has been revised to be a shorter duration, requesting less funds. The intention is to show positive results for Optimism that will support a case for a second round of incentives in the future. Number of incentivized pools seems limited and mainly Synthetix pools. Core pools should have gauges, such as Tricrypto [ETH, BTC, USDT] and 3pool [USDT, USDC, DAI]. When the proposal was first written, only Synthetix pools had gauges on Optimism. Since then, 3pool and FraxBP have received gauges on Optimism. These are basepools and set a foundation for liquidity on Curve Optimism. Curve is not an Optimism native platform, so governance involving addition of gauges and gauge weighting (a requirement for pools to begin receiving OP) would require activity on main net Ethereum. Additionally, the admin fee returns 50% of swap fees to token holders on main net. This line of reasoning takes the position that Ethereum mainnet and Optimism are somehow in competition. While the argument involves ideology, ultimately it is the ambition for Optimism to absorb liquidity most effectively. It is clear that the liquidity Curve draws to Optimism through incentivized pools far outweighs any fees sent to mainnet. Votium will launch contracts for vote incentives on Optimism, so the incentive program will take place directly on Optimism. Gauge weighting is a decentralized mechanism collectively controlled by all veCRV. This makes a commitment of co-incentives from Curve side an uncertain proposition. The first draft of this proposal planned to distribute OP to Curve LPs, and had no way to predict co-incentives because the gauge weight system is decentralized. The updated proposal instead plans to distribute OP as vote incentives for gauge weighting so there will be an economic motive for voters to direct co-incentives toward Optimism pools. This process historically results in >$1 emissions per $1 of reward deposit (over 100% incentive matching). Bribes are a more cost effective way to increase TVL This proposal was updated from distribution to LPs to distribution as vote incentives. The Balancer proposal was used as a model for this updated proposal. OP reward should be proportional to the amount of CRV allocated to pools each week, as opposed to the fixed rate of distribution laid out in the proposal. This suggestion was made to ensure that CRV is adequately co-incentivizing the pools. The updated proposal addresses the request to guarantee co-incentives from Curve. veFunder multisig as recipient address is misleading. Members are not part of Curve core team and therefore possibly a higher risk recipient Although the official Curve Twitter voiced support of the proposal and veFunder as a recipient, we have opted to create a trustless solution whereby the recipient is a smart contract governed by Curve DAO. Distribution is also handled by a contract. There is no longer any question of recipient trust involved with this proposal. Distribution plan is clear and straightforward. OP is not retained by the team/protocol, but instead is distributed entirely to LPs who are Optimism\u2019s user base. This praise was given to the first proposal, which planned to distribute OP to LPs. Now OP is planned to distribute to veCRV voters as gauge weighting rewards, and will be available for claim on Optimism. It remains true that no OP is retained by the team or protocol. Increased incentives on Curve could attract prominent partners such as Lido to make their products the primary venue on Optimism. Competition is not a zero sum game. Increasing TVL on Curve will benefit all trading venues on Optimism. ",

Am I correct in understanding all of the economic activity around staking veCRV, bribing for votes, and actual voting for Curve emissions would remain on main-net? So any projects looking to actually engage with the Curve ecosystem (outside of swapping or LPing) will need to do so off of Optimism?   I understand 50% of trading fees on Curve go to LPs and 50% go to veCRV holders, does this mean that 50% of the fees generated by this subsidized liquidity would be routinely transferred off Optimism?   When you say that \u201cCurve is currently incentivizing liquidity on Optimism in the form of CRV emissions\u201d you mean that there are veCRV lockers voting for pools such as sUSD-3CRV, right? The Curve Team itself isn\u2019t currently voting for OP pools or offering any matching incentives.   Why would Curve be asking for 1M in $OP from governance solely to offer pool 2 rewards on Synthetix pools? Didn\u2019t the Synthetix Team already received 7M OP to do just that?

So any projects looking to actually engage with the Curve ecosystem (outside of swapping or LPing) will need to do so off of Optimism?   Yes. Because no such service exists on Optimism (yet) due to technical reasons explained in the next question.   I understand 50% of trading fees on Curve go to LPs and 50% go to veCRV holders, does this mean that 50% of the fees generated by this subsidized liquidity would be routinely transferred off Optimism?   Yes this is by design, since there is a technical challenge that has a dependency on Ethereum EIP: https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_tree_eip, and could be updated once Ethereum core devs sunset Merkle Patricia Proofs and onboard Verkle Trees.

Currently only the synth pools on Optimism are getting CRV emissions (see here).  This is why they were used for the example. The way emissions work is they are determined completely by voting from the DAO.  Once gauges are voted for inclusion in the periodic gauge weight votes, they will get CRV emissions based on the proportion of voting power they receive. Note however that the DAO voting power is comprised of large entities such as Convex, Yearn, etc., in addition to many smaller longtime holders.  While unanimous decisions can occur, results often are the result of much compromise and discussion amongst community members. ",

You are saying that until or unless the DAO votes for the inclusion of other non s asset pairs in the gauge weight votes (a process that takes time and buy-in), the requested incentives will only benefit the outlined s asset pools. And if any other ecosystem projects were to want to try to participate this process by getting their own gauges approved, participate in the gauge weight votes, or bribe for votes for that their only option to do this would be on mainnet. This essentially makes the program inaccessible to Optimism native protocols or new entrants that don\u2019t have existing presences on mainnet or in Curve goveranance. This is all absolutely fine by the way, but at least in my opinion is not the kind of thing that governance should be directly incentivizing. At least until participation in Curve governance is actually possible on Optimism and there is no longer a need for 50% protocol revenue to be shipped off the chain. Perhaps Curve could apply for a grant through the partner fund to help to accelerate these kinds of efforts and revisit LP incentive boosts from goverance once they\u2019re further along? ",

Eventually Curve attracts the majority of liquidity and trades on Optimism, and they all automatically route 50% of fees back to mainnet.

There are other options than lobbying veCRV holders directly, but ultimately garnering support is necessary, as is the case for receiving any emissions from Curve.  As a Velodrome team member, I\u2019m biased, but this is not what I\u2019d like for the ecosystem.  You guys have already stated you understand the importance of working with Curve (and Convex) when you airdropped $VELO to veCRV and vlCVX holders:  \u201c$VELO tokens will be distributed to the people who have played the biggest role in incubating Velodrome and those likeliest to contribute to its long-term success\u201d  I assume you were aware all along this is how the protocol works when you airdropped to veCRV holders.  I would like to understand where this objection is coming from.  Are you are looking out for other protocols on Optimism?  They may not be able to marshall the efforts you guys were able to?  I would say let\u2019s not underestimate others, including your potential competition.  Best case for Curve, the CRV wars heat up among Optimism protocols and they all bridge funds to mainnet to compete.  Best case perhaps in a static world. ",

In the case of this proposal, all of the incentives go to Optimism users, and none of it goes to any centralised dev team or core team. The proposal was also entirely written by a community member, and not a core team member asking to be paid to build on Optimism.   Finally: the Curve DAO from mainnet has the ability to co-incentivise LPs on Curve Optimism. Members of the DAO have already been doing this for a while, incentivising liquidity on Optimism significantly before Optimism even had a token: thus helping Optimism bootstrap liquidity in its embryonic stage.

Its not something special that you are doing only on OP chain ?   Curve emission is fundamental to Curve protocol, yes. (I realize I\u2019m going overboard with links, sry).Curve gauges can and do exist everywhere that Curve does. This is important to clarify because if it required custom built functionality to work with Optimism, I\u2019d be a little suspicious about whether the dev overhead would be manageable. Actually, the integration with Optimism already exists, it\u2019s even trivial and permissionless to deploy a gauge and create an on-chain vote to receive emissions (you can do this from the curve optimism UI).     OPUser:  Do you have project or DAO budget in form of CRV ? Will you be able to provide any form of co-incentives ?   I consider the gauge to be Curve\u2019s budget, and is the exclusive method for Curve to incentivize its liquidity pools. Currently veCRV voters direct something like 600k CRV emissions/day. There is a DAO community fund, but this is reserved for community and ecosystem grants, not for liquidity incentivization. I can appreciate the uncertainty of whether pools will receive gauge weighting, but I am confident that the current Optimism gauges will be well utilized- Synthetix has indeed been actively incentivizing its sUSD gauge. Gauges become weighted when there is some value in it to someone - either an LP wanting to boost their rewards or a protocol wanting to establish its stablecoin, or a veCRV voter seeing high utilization of a particular pool and hoping to increase revenue. It\u2019s also a protective mechanism, to make sure incentives are distributed where people collectively get most value from it. I hope also that out of this discussion will generate interest in creating new gauges by up and coming protocols on Optimism ",

Drop that much on Velodrome bribes, you\u2019d likely be able to attract 2x the TVL. And any of those options wouldn\u2019t come with the need for fees or bribes to head off chain. I\u2019d like to see this proposal reflect some kind of mutual investment from Curve and/or it\u2019s major stakeholders commensurate with the ask from Optimism Governance. I also continue to think that working with the foundation to explore a partner grant for a full Curve deployment on Optimism might be a better first step for all parties.

Whilst it appears some progress has been made, there are still customers with out\u2026     I can see a similar eventuality in this instance although not as blatant or as deliberate, but due to Curve\u2019s main mechanisms being outside of Optimism.

                    "content": "As some have expressed concern over mercenary liquidity and all the benefits of the program going back to mainnet, it may be useful to look at a previous instance of Curve being the beneficiary of such an incentive program. From early October 2021 to January 2022, Curve was one of the protocols selected to receive a grant in WAVAX as part of Avalanche\u2019s Rush program aimed at developing DeFi on the chain. The WAVAX grant was redistributed by Curve to liquidity providers of the aave (3pool equivalent with lending) and tricrypto pools. The chart below shows the TVL of these two pools over time, with the highlighted area denoting the duration of the Avalanche Rush program:  image754\u00d7397 43 KB  As you can see, the incentives (doubled with CRV incentives) proved extremely successful and helped drive the TVL from nothing to over 1 billion dollars. There was a TVL dip in both pools once the rewards ended, but this only proved temporary. By February both pools had recovered and the aave pool went to reach a new ATH in TVL and maintained deep liquidity until the recent market downturn. Not only did the incentivized pools maintain their TVL long after the incentive program had ended, they also did so in a more competitive environment. Another stableswap platform with veTokenomics, Platypus, launched on Avalanche in January and went on to reach over 100m TVL (they too, benefitted from incentives as part of the Avalanche Rush programs). This should assuage the concern raised by the Velo team above, as it shows that competition is not a zero-sum game It helped increase the overall TVL of the Avalanche protocol while both competitors also increased their TVL. A competitive ecosystem on Optimism will bring more users and more value than a single monopolistic player. Finally, one should note that the growth of Curve\u2019s TVL as a result of the incentive programs also created many positive externalities as other projects built upon Curve. On Avalanche, Abracadabra, Beefy.finance, Blizz, Yeti.finance, Yield Yak are some of the protocols that offered products relying on Curve pools and yield, which themselves brought more users and liquidity to the chain. tl;dr Liquidity stays on Curve even after incentives are gone; Curve growth strongly contributes  to development of the chain\u2019s ecosystem.

Velodrome\u2019s success depends 100% on the success of the ecosystem, which is why we\u2019re increasingly vocal in governance. I think it is clear now that some of the early proposals led to less than ideal outcomes and that is something we\u2019re committed to doing our best to help avoid going forward. Every new grant has an opportunity cost and dilutes those previously distributed, so we need to make sure the ROI is there as we continue to invest. For me personally, subsidizing TVL and volume that will ship 50% of fees off chain may be a deal breaker given the existence of alternatives (not just Velodrome) that don\u2019t require this kind of value extraction. Likewise for the requirement  that projects will have to go to mainnet to engage in Curve governance to have a shot at having a gauge that might be eligible for the rewards. If in the future these obstacles are removed, I\u2019ll feel differently. I think the future is on L2 and Optimism users should be able to get the full Curve experience if we\u2019re going to drop 1M in incentives on it. That said, if these aren\u2019t deal breakers for others here is something I think could make the proposal stronger. Choose a single public good pool (like tri crypto) and vote to make it eligible for CRV emissions on Optimism. Then work with a collection of Curve stakeholders to commit to a certain amount of voting power that would be dedicated to this pool over the duration of the incentive program. Then request an equal proportion of  OP incentives as a match or boost to those emissions. This way, you are growing Curve on Optimism with OP incentives in a way that doesn\u2019t gatekeep participation to those with mainnet presences. You are also functionally matching the incentives that Optimism governance is granting you, demonstrating a commitment to ecosystem investment. ",

These airdrops provide no direct value to the Optimism ecosystem and are essentially a subsidy to boost the price of VELO. Indeed, the majority of OP funds requested by Velodrome directly benefit Velodrome development with no direct benefits to the Optimism ecosystem more broadly. For example, 600,000 OP are allocated to \u201cprotocols that integrate Velodrome\u2019s liquidity layer\u201d and another 600,000 are allocated to developing a \u201cvote delegation and autocompounding feature that is directly built into Velodrome\u201d.

I think our system is robust, and we are actively working to improve our UI, bribing contract, and other elements of our protocol. That should and will be our primary focus.

This misunderstanding (some would say FUD) was evident from the very start, has been elaborated on, and actively deflected with irrelevant, out-of-context screenshots from these other venues.  This form of engagement that Velodrome prefers has drawn praise from some quarters as \u201chustle\u201d or \u201cbeing passionate\u201d and self-described as unavoidably part of \u201can inherently political process\u201d:  I do believe it is worthwhile to cut through the noise.  Very rarely can one find the original causal force that starts a complex mass moving.  But sometimes you can find one screenshot:  Screen Shot 2022-07-29 at 6.50.44 PM613\u00d7738 85.1 KB  This \u201cfeeling\u201d (less than one day after the draft proposal was posted) that value will entirely flow back to Mainnet is the initial, powerful impulse that has led to this wide-ranging discussion happening in multiple venues of social media.  Everything since then has been some form of elaboration or deflection on this basic feeling. So let\u2019s put aside all the noise.  Let\u2019s put aside the silly inaccuracy about pool2s in the tweet, which he repeated here, and let\u2019s put aside the various leading questions asked by Alex Cutler in his posts here, including his strange screenshot of Mainnet pools, before he finally decided to \u201cweigh in\u201d. Let\u2019s talk about this feeling that value will flow back to Mainnet.  Why would someone feel that 2 basis points of volume going back to Mainnet will result in everything else going back to Mainnet? On the face of it, this is an absurd claim. Rather than address why 2 basis points of volume is so crucial, they ask a related but quite different question, which is easier for them to defend.  In behavioral economics, this is called the substitution heuristic.  When faced with a hard question you can\u2019t answer, you substitute a similar, but different question that is easy to answer.  It is quite deceptive and easy to pull off and funnily enough, not always done to you by others but by yourself.  Why? So that your smoll brain can avoid facing reality. Instead of asking the relevant question, they substitute with:  do you believe it\u2019s right for value to flow back to Mainnet? do you believe Optimism should incentivize value to leave Optimism? do you believe people should be voting on Mainnet for something that affects Optimism? do you believe Curve should be doing more on Optimism? do you believe people should be allowed to use Curve on Mainnet if they use Curve on Optimism? isn\u2019t it better to not use Mainnet at all?  Note how many of these questions have to do with beliefs, particularly about seemingly deep issues that when actually pondered are quite vapid.  For example, \u201cdo you believe Curve should be doing more on Optimism?\u201d  Obviously more Curve LPs will come if there are more incentives. So the practical matter is, if you want Curve LPs to come, you give them more.  And why do you want them to come?  Because the more of them, the better the trading and more traders come too.  There is no deep philosophy here. That doesn\u2019t matter if the purpose is to deflect of course.  Then the more absurd the better, as people get distracted from the real question: Would 2 basis points of all the volume Curve brings to Optimism going back to Mainnet result in everything else going back to Mainnet? So remember, next time the Velodrones ask you, \u201cSomething something value on Mainnet?\u201d just ask them to answer this first.  This is in fact the most pertinent question if you are interested in making money trading on Optimism, not in holding some vague idealistic philosophy that happens to very coincidentally align with defending one protocol\u2019s moat.

That might help us understand how the ratio of rewards ($ in OP: $ in CRV) would look as currently written. Overall, I think it may still be worth considering adjusting the distribution mechanism to reflect (at least roughly) a 1:1 match of CRV emissions to OP emissions. This is the kind of thing that governance has pushed a lot protocol proposals on to ensure that the investment governance is making is being reciprocated. If you were to make that adjustment, it would be added incentive for veCRV voters to vote for Optimism pools (increasing emissions flowing into the Optimism ecosystem) as they would know the value of the rewards flowing to LPs would be doubled over other pools (boosting Curve\u2019s overall TVL and fee generation). Since it sounds like bribes and fees will need to continue to flow to main-net for the time being, this would be a good way to show that this is about bringing more value to both Curve and Optimism versus being overly weighted one way or another.

                    "content": "    OPGovWatch:  How will protocols with no veCRV positions to create gauges benefit from this grant?   You dont need veCRV to create a gauge. Anyone is welcome to create a proposal for a gauge that receives CRV emissions at gov.curve.fi. Protocols that have demonstrated a good track record and demand for their product generally have a good shot a passing a vote, even if they have no veCRV position.     OPGovWatch:  25,000 OP/week for LPs is a lot. What percentage of incentives is Curve to match in CRV?   25k/week, to be clear, is the total split between all gauged pools. Curve matches incentives based on veCRV gauge weighting, which is decentralized and therefore I\u2019m unable to give a concrete percentage. If Optimism becomes the dominant network for liquidity and trading, gauge weighting will likely shift toward Optimism, and CRV emissions last for hundreds of years. We are in the bootstrapping phase now to draw initial liquidity.     OPGovWatch:  What is the Curve roadmap on Optimism?   I am not a Curve team member, so I can\u2019t answer that authoritatively. What I believe personally is that liquidity should shift toward L2\u2019s to achieve scalability. This article by Delphi Digital shows how Curve would be much more competitive in a low gas fee environment. Also, L2\u2019s also make more dense metapools viable, for example a [tricrypto, 3pool] pool (ETH, BTC, USDT, USDC, DAI), which is too gas intensive for mainnet.     OPGovWatch:  How we avoid the fate of Curve on Fantom and Avalanche?   From what I see, the \u201cfate of Fantom and Avalanche\u201d was that these were alt L1\u2019s that were uber-hyped during a bull market that favored the Ethereum killer narrative, and when I look at charts of TVL for other DeFi apps on those networks, it\u2019s the same story. Avoiding the same fate really comes down to building a network that is resilient and scalable where people feel comfortable keeping most of their money. Again, my personal opinion is the L2\u2019s are better positioned to become the dominant application layer after all the hype cycles.     OPGovWatch:  What is the future work Curve is committing to?   I\u2019m not sure that your quote from the Governance Update applies to this situation. I would think that applies if a proposer is requesting compensation for a public good they\u2019ve created for Optimism. Curve is also a public good, but the proposal is not requesting compensation to Curve for their work. This is entirely being passed onto LP\u2019s, who are Optimism\u2019s user base, many of whom are in this thread and who will directly benefit from an incentive program. Again, not a Curve team member, but I know Curve has plans to add features to Optimism in the future. That includes a V2 pool factory and CRV LP boosting capability.     OPGovWatch:  Can we expect to Curve to migrate governance, fees, and bribing capabilities to Optimism?   Migrating core governance probably wont be on the table for the forseeable future for security reasons. What I imagine could be possible in the medium term as cross chain interoperability improves, a user\u2019s voter power could be read from main net and used to allocate fees and bribes directly on Optimism. Curve is limited currently by the rudimentary tools available to access data across chains, which is a big pain point for all of DeFi right now. ",

For the next version of the proposal, I would suggest either finding a way to bring further details or commitments around co-incentives (or other investments into Optimism) or significantly lowering the initial ask. It might also help to review a few other protocol\u2019s successful proposals and the discussion around them. Generally speaking, governance has insisted on more details on co-incentives than is currently being offered in this proposal. I understand why that might be challenging given Curve\u2019s design, but it seems critical given the size of the ask. Just as one example, here was the passed proposal from Balancer & Beethoven.     [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Balancer & BeethovenX Governance Fund: Phase 1       Project Name: BeethovenX, powered by Balancer  Author Name: Solarcurve (BalancerDAO contributor, BeethovenX advisor)  Number of OP tokens requested: 500,000  L2 Recipient Address: 0x2a185C8A3C63d7bFe63aD5d950244FFe9d0a4b60  Relevant Usage Metrics: Balancer has ~$1.4B TVL and does ~$500M volume per week. This is the network OP incentives would be competing in through the veBAL gauge vote.  Currently on OP we have ~$4.8M TVL, ~$500k daily volume, ~$3-4k daily fees,  ~2k daily tx\u2019s.

It is commonly cited as the more efficient method of attracting TVL, and is the strategy proposed in Balancer\u2019s proposal. If this strategy provides greater assurance to Optimism that both parties will carry their weight, I will propose to evenly split the weekly distribution on bribes between all gauged pools on Optimism.
