Given the experience with Akita and all of it\u2019s immense downside, I think the Stewards of GitCoin should establish a few simple rules concerning \u2018token drops\u2019. I propose that any token drop that appears in the GitCoin Multisig without a prior vote by some committee of or the entire group of stewards be rejected by immediately (or within some time frame) sending the tokens back to the sender. Reasoning: to better protect GitCoin\u2019s community good will and avoid the ugly, unnecessary nonsense that\u2019s gone on related to the Akita token incident including the \u2018creative interpretation\u2019 and near-blackmail as has been revealed on Twitter. The idea is that in order for any token to remain in the GitCoin multisig, it must have been \u2018whitelisted\u2019 in some way first. This will eliminate the need to make any decision and allow the Stewards to act without needing to justify their behavior as it will have been already established. ",

I am a bit confuse even after reading all the post regarding the Akita token incident. Who did drop these tokens?, Why?, Why we should redistribute them? What was the purpose of this drop? At who this drop was indented to be? Who did started this project and why it landed here at Gitcoin? What is the relation about this project and Gitcoin? Citing this post here:    [Proposal - Akita] Proposal to Gitcoin community from AKITA \ud83d\udcdc Proposal Discussion       This is the AKITA communities proposal to the recent decision by Vitalik Buterin to send half of their supply to Gitcoin.  1. Summary -  Our proposal is to burn everything that VB sent except for 5%. Leave 5% to stimulate progress between both communities. The reason for 5% is because, prior to the original developer leaving the project they burned 5% of the supply. This gives the token supply a 5% window that can be extracted before starting to mess with the original token metrics of the projec\u2026      I quote in this proposal: \u201cThe motivation behind this proposal is to mitigate collateral damage. The Akita investors invested believing that half of our supply was \u201cburned\u201d to VBs wallet.\u201d The motivation behind this proposal is not really clear. Why should Gitcoin interfere with the valuation of this project by redistributing these tokens or by allowing ressources consumption from burning them. It\u2019s clear that many user want a redistribution, but at what cost, what are the main impacts, pros and cons etc. ",

                    "content": "I will take an analogy to evaluate this, by thinking about the Akita instance. Unless a token is notorious, it can be part of GTC community by default (i.e. legit custodian send token to community address, the gitcoin became the new custodian). Otherwise multisig wallet can vote and reject. Analogy: Token A joined Gitcoin with some hesitation (wallet owner made the choice, but not other hodler/speculators), therefore it is part of GTC community, it should have some degree of \u2018freedom\u2019 to find out whether prefer to stay or go. (One possible way of giving that freedom back to A community: Put 50% of A and pair with GTC to create a new liquidity pool (so price is set at the time) - or maybe 10% at a time so price discovery can be spread on 5 attempts, with say 6 month break in between so total 2 years, then this 50% is free to go. The rest 50% A will be part of the GTC community and will not be sold. (Maybe use as grant/capital/even voting, it is a separate issue) So we end up with a portfolio of token alliance. it is like a charitable extension or franchise part of wider gitcoin community. Benefits: The impact of gitcoin community is much wider by this type of token alliance. If this didn\u2019t work out (how do we define this?) - it is a phased approach so all can learn and change the direction. ) ",

If there\u2019s a pre-stated policy about what do with unsolicited tokens (sell them immediately, send them back, whatever), the crazy ad hoc nature of the \u201cAkita incident\u201d might be avoided. Plus, if there was a very clear policy like - we will immediately sell unsolicited tokens - there may be less of an reason to send them in the first place. ",
