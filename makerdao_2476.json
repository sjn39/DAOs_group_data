One thing I will note is that it\u2019s not currently following the MIP13c3 template with regards to the preamble (see here: https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP13/MIP13c3-Subproposal-Template.md) Specifically the last two fields are missing: MIP13c3-SP#: # Author(s): Contributors: Status:  Date Proposed: <yyyy-mm-dd> Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd> --- Declaration Statement: Declaration to Replace: MIP13c3-SP# or n/a  The Declaration Statement is particularly important, as it acts as a short identifier of what the declaration is, which is used in the list in MIP13 to identify it. For this subproposal I\u2019d suggest something like: \u201cMaker Governance intends to limit changes to Risk Parameters unless the criteria included in MIP13c3-SP1 is met.\u201d (Though this doesn\u2019t touch on a working group, so perhaps Akiva can come up with a better statement)      Akiva:  The MakerDAO community, while reserving its right to react at any time to any given risk, will create a working group to identify particular factors that would result in events a,b,c, listed above in Article 1 thereby providing forward guidance to Vault users.   I would say this is maybe the most interesting part of this declaration. @Akiva did you have any thoughts about this working group? Is it something you\u2019d like to lead? Or did you have someone in mind? ",

For that reason I propose that someone co-leads it who is in the business of representing MKR holders, potentially someone from a risk team. Ultimately we just don\u2019t want to mix buy-side and sell-side in MakerDAO. ",
