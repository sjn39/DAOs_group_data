So this is the collateral side that basically involves the Cayman part of 6s International in terms of legal entity offering up the US based collateral for escrow into a US based trust. I don\u2019t want to make more work but I think a kind of info-diagram of the parties with their juridictions as well as what they hold/do (i.e. what is transferred via a kind of venn diagram also showing their legal jurisdiction) might be nice here.   The who (a person, company), the what (DAI, USD, collateral or collateral rights), and the where (in terms of jurisdiction) might be really helpful to me/people here. ",

The structure well done (ofc) and the whole who has jurisdiction over Maker is a whole grey area.   I think this is why I wanted to see the jurisdictions applicable in the whole structure.   Not a huge deal because I can just take the intographics you presented above and just print them and then look at the paper work to see who has jurisdiction where. Man - well detailed as usual Matt.    Probably won\u2019t have time to review carefully to see if I spot anything but your lawyers are top-notch.  I don\u2019t expect too many places for wiggle.   My concern is the jurisdictional situation with respect to the Maker Rep(s) so I just wanted to get a handle on where things would be settled if there were any hitches\u2026 (i.e. the clauses). Thanks again Matt. ",
