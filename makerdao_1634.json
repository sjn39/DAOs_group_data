So, a question is coming to my mind that if the ethereum address provided by a member to obtain DAI for their contributions under sourcecred is hacked/compromised by any chance. What should be done? Is there any way to change the wallet address, if yes then what is the procedure? Sorry if this question has already been asked before. ",
