Dai will suddenly become just another fiat currency with the associated problems that brings. I love to hear about all sorts of ideas - but pretty please - don\u2019t seriously bring up printing unbacked Dai. ",

I am currently short a large amount of Dai via a vault loan, and Dai trading up to $1.03 is a problem for me if the price continues to blow out. I have real skin in this game. Theoretical considerations on what Dai should be based on what we knew in 2015 are not very relevant in today\u2019s environment of liquidity farming and negative real interest rates on Ethereum. We need effective solutions to restore the peg. Six months of trying to onboard more collateral hasn\u2019t done it, and certainly won\u2019t do it now. A lot of people don\u2019t want to borrow Dai until Dai has proven that it can maintain the $1 peg. That\u2019s the bottom line here. Personally, I would prefer printing Dai to buy ETH over printing Dai to buy USDC. I\u2019d prefer printing MKR for borrowers to subsidize Dai creation over both of those, but it may be too late for that to be effective. ",
