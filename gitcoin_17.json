                    "content": "I used to think Gitcoin\u2019s flagship product was Gitcoin Grants. Now I\u2019ve started to think of GitcoinDAO as a product itself, and I think our flagship product might actually be GitcoinDAO.  Why? Because GitcoinDAO is the totality of what we do and how we show up. Gitcoin Grants is just one part. As we know, Gitcoin grants is a quadratic funding crowdfunding platform that basically works like this\u2026  914\u00d71028 25.7 KB  By using Gitcoin Grants to fund public goods, the community has created $52mm worth of impact. Which is great, but what you don\u2019t see when you look at this view is the whole breadth of inputs + outputs that have come out of the GitcoinDAO ecosystem to produce this experience. You don\u2019t see what\u2019s below the surface. You don\u2019t see the machine behind the machine. The broader view of what\u2019s going on (and the impact they create):  1316\u00d7986 51.7 KB  When you use Gitcoin Grants, you don\u2019t see all the ingredients going into the experience. You don\u2019t\u2019 see the deeper outputs coming out of them. You only see the tip of the iceberg.  500\u00d7759 128 KB  Another good one:  When you fully consider all thats below the surface, you see:  Without public goods fund raising, we wouldn\u2019t have Gitcoin Grants as we know it. Without fraud defense, we wouldn\u2019t have Gitcoin Grants as we know it. Without product, we wouldn\u2019t have Gitcoin Grants as we know it. Without marketing, we wouldn\u2019t have Gitcoin Grants as we know it. Without governance, we wouldnt have Gitcoi Grants as we know it. Without Gitcoin Grants, we wouldnthave Gitcoin as a social schelling point for the ecosystem, we wouldn\u2019t have KERNEL We wouldn\u2019t have educated people about public goods as much as we have. We wouldn\u2019t have Green Pilled. We wouldnt have nearly the same impact.   By zooming out, we focus on all of the infrastructure we need to increase our impact. When we focus on GitcoinDAO instead of just Gitcoin Grants, We are no longer building the machine, we are building the machine that builds the machine. What would have to be true to think of GitcoinDAO as a product? What would have to be true to treat it with the same attention to detail and conscious experience sculpting that we\u2019ve seen brought to Gitcoin Grants? Here are some things I think are worthy goals for a DAO designing itself: Treat each other well. Honor our customers & partners. Dogfood our own product. Decentralize as much as possible. Create as much legitimacy as possible. Create as much impact as possible. Be as inclusive as possible. Craft cohesive & world class contributor journeys. Of course it\u2019s not my place to say what the goals of the DAO are as I\u2019m just one contributor among many. I\u2019d welcome feedback from others. One person I think is brilliant and has deep experience in DAOS who we should listen to is Tracheopteryx. In his talk at schelling point about DAOS, he talks a lot about the DAO contributor experience. He claims at each dao you need :  process fidelity - trust that my actions will replicate in the way i expect them operational access - how do I access the levers of powers in the dao? network topography - can I see what else is in the DAO, and what they\u2019re doing?  Another great quote from Trach\u2019s preso:  The structure of an organizations affects it\u2019s contributors perception & autonomy, and thus an organizations capabilities are relative to its structure.  What do you think? Is GitcoinDAO our primary product? How can we make the contributor experience for all of the \u201cJobs to be Done\u201d in the DAO great? ",

To the extent that people buy GTC and ascribe to it its value because they are investing in the work of GitcoinDAO and want to support its existence then yes, I\u2019d say our organization is our metaproduct. And our other offerings - grants and its supporting features - are like features of this product. As a marketer, this is actually pretty helpful to think through as we consider how to invest in brand, comprehension, engagement, and our other goals and figure out how we can bring the best and most relevant marketing frameworks to bear.

I do think one thing we do sell is \u201cGItcoinDAOs mission\u201d.  eg we want people to equate \u201cGitcoin = solarpunk future\u201d or \u201cGitcoin = solve coordination failure\u201d in their brains. What do you think about this post which makes the case that the DAO\u2019s function is to create coordination in web3 ecosystems?  This post takes the approach of not getting lost in the details of how - QF is one means to do it, as is KERNEL, as are hacks, as is MC, as are direct proposals to the DAO.  However, when you\u2019re in DAO land, things are a bit different.  For companies, I think that so much is provided out of the box by tools like Trinet, Rippling, and other administration tools, that is not provided in DAOs.  Being in a DAO, trying to reinvent a great employee experience feels similar to the classic economic thought experiment about why no one knows how to make a pencil In a DAO, we are trying to reinvent these things as we climb the people > product > profits ladder.  As a marketer, this is actually pretty helpful to think through as we consider how to invest in brand, comprehension, engagement, and our other goals and figure out how we can bring the best and most relevant marketing frameworks to bear. Would love thoughts from others as well!  I\u2019d be curious, once we nail the QF engagement loops, how to increase comprehension and engagement for everyday members of the DAO. Maybe one way to frame things is  Our internal facing flagship product is the DAO. Our external facing flagship product is Grants.  Maybe all of the above is semantics tho - My primary hope when authoring this post was to instigate conversation about \u201cHow can we make the contributor experience for all of the \u201cJobs to be Done\u201d in the DAO great?\u201d ",

Because imho this logic can be a trap, you lose track of who we\u2019re building this for and why. It becomes a machine, a bank, a corporation. To give the example out of my personal experience, at Microsoft we did say that our primary products were our products. But actually it wasn\u2019t, our primary or meta product was the company. And it needed to increase in value to our shareholders. That was - and still is - the main goal. Working at Microsoft was awesome. Employees were pampered to the extreme. But we didn\u2019t build for our external customer, we built for ourselves. Applying this analogy to Gitcoin I don\u2019t think that GitcoinDAO should be our product. We definitely should have a clearer mission & objectives that define what brings us all together and refines what we are building for whom. Our setup can and should inspire other DAOs, but we are not building for our tokenholders. We are building because Public Goods are Good. And they need our support. By the way, I know the above is a dark timeline and not what we intend to do or what you mean @owocki but I do think it\u2019s worth mentioning in this context. Very curious to hear if my response resonates or if I\u2019m missing a point here. Edit - reading the other comments, I\u2019ll still read the coordination post you linked (trying not to fall too deep in the endless brilliant owocki posts rabbithole today) but yes, I think it\u2019s good to make a clear distinction between the \u2018DAO contributor experience documentation\u2019 (and inspiration) flow and Gitcoin\u2019s mission.

This might change in the future as we help other organisations (may or may not be DAOs) that wish to create a similar structure to serve goals of similar complexity. The quote might change to  Without FDD from GitcoinDAO, we would not have Proof of PersonhoodDAO Without Product from GitcoinDAO, we would not have aqueductDAO  GitcoinDAO becomes a DAO generator instead? There could be a time where Gitcoin grants and its surrounding operational activities are self sustaining and GitcoinDAO moves on to grow other DAOs that work on equally or more complex problems.

(so in a way they are building for themselves, and that\u2019s a good thing vs megacorps, where truly motivated and \u2018external product\u2019 - focused employees and stakeholders are groups with different interests) So yes, in that sense I agree:     owocki:  yeah agree, idk if  \u201cinternal product\u201d or \u201cmeta-product\u201d for the DAO \u201cexternal product\u201d for Grants (and other external products)    \u2026 where the internal product is reinforcing the effectiveness of the DAO in shipping its external products.

                    "content": "This conversation is wonderful. It is bringing in divergent thinking mixed with some mission-first analysis.  I am imagining many possible paths ahead for GC and enjoying the thought-exercise.     Fishbiscuit:  GitcoinDAO becomes a DAO generator instead?   This seems to be the most common product I see daos offering.  Daos seem to think because they formed a group that others will want to copy their group-formation methods.  This puzzled me then and still puzzles me now.  Maybe it was because early-on, there was a pressing need for guidance in this area.  Nobody knew what a dao was let-alone how to build and operate one, so the focus was on spreading the construction techniques.  I wonder if there is enough pie left in this pan to slice further\u2026I am pessimistic this will bring us much benefit aligned with our core values and think that GC can offer more than another dao-wizard or integrated dao-software-stack.     owocki:  What do you think? Is GitcoinDAO our primary product?   I believe the Gitcoin Dao is our primary product.  I don\u2019t come from an entrepreneur or tech background and so my opinion is more of a lay-person\u2019s perspective.  I might be playing semantic games here but if the GPG/LLC is folding, and transferring responsibilities and assets to the GC Dao than what else even remains that could be considered primary?  The \u201cEarn, Learn, Connect, Fund\u201d headline on our website suggests the four items are foundational, but doesn\u2019t imply that one is primary.  Historically I would argue that Grants were the flagship product.  Not anymore.  If the Gitcoin company wants to decentralize and run as a Dao, our mission-first principle suggests the Dao must be the primary product or we risk failing the mission.  Decentralization of a legacy-style company is not an easy or fast process. I think of the Gitcoin Dao as a bus.  Making the bus operational is the primary product.  And by achieving the primary product we open the door to a blank-canvas of secondary-product opportunities.  We can drive that bus anywhere.  We can continually refine and prune our offerings to the world.  We can explore new areas of focus.  But only if our bus is properly cared for. It makes sense that we zoom out the perspective.  GPG/LLC ran the show centralized-style, it was tight & effective and there was space to innovate.  The GC Dao is not nearly as tight & effective and so I believe we should consider the dao as the product, until we reach similar levels of efficiency.  Once the dao gets fully tuned and equipped with the processes and infrastructure required we can really embrace the secondary products and innovation areas.  We are still not quite there. ",

Thinking of it as a product definitely provides insight! Though thinking of it as a longship crossing uncharted oceans also provides insight\u2026 Two product mental model questions: (1) How much is the product infused into all the other products? Compare Apple infusing itself as a product into all of its \u201cchild\u201d products with Microsoft not doing that so much. The result is an Apple child is much more of a \u201cflex\u201d but a Microsoft child can safely stray more from the \u201cparent.\u201d (2) How much is the product an experience or an object? Remembering that ultimately spacetime is unified so a \u201cnoun\u201d and \u201cverb\u201d cannot be fully separated but also Von Neumann machines have produced literal general purpose automation. Less abstract, a fast car in a driveway is there to drive, a marble statue in a plaza is there to stay still, a freshly served filet mignon at a restaurant is there to be eaten warm and a vacation package is time off work away from home.
