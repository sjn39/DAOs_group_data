                    "content": "This thread is for vault owners that want to come - or anyone really and pretty much make entries like Vault NNNNN - Comments  to present their Black Thursday loss post mortem event. This thread is simply about accumulating individual vault data so the full picture can emerge of the event and potentially a claims submission place for individual vault holders. I know that everyone at Maker wants to express sincere apologies for any misunderstandings as well as actual losses during this event, we feel your pain to the tune of ~80% of the total loss and want to do the best we can for the community as a community. With respect to being paid back - this is completely a Maker governance question (I this OP is but one small voice).  But if we can basically tally the cases and data here just as post mortem facts finding thread - particularly by the vault owners themselves I think it gives Maker governance a better look to make the best decision about whether and/or how much to compensate vault owners. So here you go felix - kick it off with Vault 2288 if you\u2019d like or someone else pick a vault (how about the largest one) and give the full post mortem on it. It would be interesting alone to know how many vaults were affected by not just the 0 bid issue (which we have some data on thanks to: https://medium.com/@whiterabbit_hq/black-thursday-for-makerdao-8-32-million-was-liquidated-for-0-dai-36b83cac56b6 but other issues we don\u2019t even know about yet like Vault 2288.

Here is the link to my CDP Vault 2288:  https://defiexplore.com/cdp/2288  After seeing the 0 bid liquidations I realised I had to exit my CDP as the system was under failure.  The long story short is this. The events of the 0 bid liquidations caused me to have to ACT fast in order to avoid being liquidated to 0. I was even told in MakerDAO chat on the day as it was happening. \"Do not get liquidated.\"   This file has been truncated. show original        ",

Im extremely disheartened by this whole thing, i have been trying to get my friends and colleagues to use mkr as it offers something which usually would take a lot of paperwork and time. When i saw my cdp at 0 i knew something was not right, i havent read the fine prints but i think its fair to presume most users would expect that when a liquidation occurs enough eth is sold to cover the debt and the rest is left in the cdp. Im sorry for the loss of all the vault owners including myself and hope that we are compensated for our loss. its only fair. thanks neece ",

I had 99ETH as collateral during the crash - tried all day to add ETH (I had 100 more ETH in my Ledger Live wallet) but the transaction sat as \u201cPending\u201d most of the day. There is no apparent way to add gas using my Nano X/ LedgerLive while using the Oasis App to increase the chances of the transaction going through. Very disappointed that I spent most of the day trying to add collateral to the contract, but the system was overloaded making it impossible. Here are my values on that day: 99 ETH as collateral - I generated 7,000 DAI on March 10th. With ETH value at $200.00 my Collateralization ratio was approx. 280%. On Black Thursday, I tried repeatedly to add ETH to the vault, but due to the falling ETH price, my transactions were stuck as \u201cPending\u201d transactions and never completed. At today\u2019s ETH price, I have a loss of 88 ETH ( -$14,960) plus the $7000.00 DAI = $7,960.00 LOST. My contract got liquidated and I ended up with only 11.22 ETH being sent back to my vault. My next challenge was withdrawing the 11 ETH, it took days of failed attempts to get the ETH back into my Ledger, and then finally it worked using the exact same procedure, almost as if a bug had been fixed(?) I would encourage the developers of Oasis to add a Gas Slider to the deposit window of the vault. Now that it\u2019s over, I have learned that MetaMask allows for increasing the gas for a deposit, but there is no way to add gas using a Ledger Nano X. I also feel that there is more instructions needed in the Oasis GUI. How about some \u201c?\u201d bubbles that you can click to get more info? https://etherscan.io/address/0x10bbb2a8917a529028b10cf250af467d54c0d3df Thanks to anyone who can help with the loss, for me it is very real. - Earl ",

Lets keep discussion on the details of the report, questions, comments, etc. focused in this thread.  Stay tuned for updates on when a conference call on this report will occur.     Maker Governance has decided via on-chain poll its intention to compensate Black Thursday Vault owners but the details of compensation still being discussed. Thank you all for your patience on this.   Hopefully this process will complete and governance will ratify some kind of compensation package.   I know a number of you self liquidated (vault 2288) and have made reports here these all will be considered in due course as this process unfolds. ",

So, I lost 88 ETH thru liquidation ($17,336 at today\u2019s price) but after taking into consideration the $7,000 DAI that was not lost, I have a loss of $17,336 minus $7,000 for a total loss of $10,336 at today\u2019s price.

                    "content": "N/A just means they are not in the 0-bid liquidation set over the time chosen.   So you are not in the 0-bid compensation plan proper. I see you basically were liquidated when the Market price to OSM was larger than 20% and the market price was falling while your vault was being liquidated. I will make a note of you when discussing this as you will be one that fell outside the selected time range.   (i.e. there were no 0-bid auctions going on)   What I do see is that market prices at the time were already starting to fall.   Literally OSM was 171 and some markets were at like 135-140 which with the 13% liquidation fee pretty much put you in the no-collateral return level. The only way anyone gets even close to the theoretical collateral return of 24.67% is if the market is either going up after falling and triggering an auction or that the OSM is matching market.   At times the market is > 20% lower than the OSM auctions will be \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018efficient\u2019 but simply not return collateral. Like I said I will note you in the list but can already anticipate governance here which will be a possible narrowing of compensation against a market performance filter vs. a tab based on like I chose and I will need a better dataset with prices and timings to even have a hope of applying such a filter. I was there watching these markets on these days (like I normally do) and we were seeing 10% or greater drops in minutes.   No way one could expect anything close to theoretical collateral return in such circumstances.  That is like expecting people to overpay for something from you when they can buy it cheaper elsewhere.   Due to the nature of the auction process it is possible for keepers to basically overbid and then be stuck with a loss on the collateral.   Which is EXACTLY what happened to many keepers during the time you were liquidated.   It is why I think you got some of your collateral back vs. getting none. ",

Maker MCD Ethereum System Liquidation report and Black Thursday Compensation Analysis Governance       Greetings Maker community,  At long last the Maker MCD Ethereum Liquidation and Black Thursday Compensation Analysis reports are availble below.    Lets keep discussion on the details of the report, questions, comments, etc. focused in this thread.  Stay tuned for updates on when a conference call on this report will occur.     I encourage people to use defiexplore.com to look at the history of their vault. I am not sure what is up with the data here 4056.   In my data I show you should have gotten collateral back.  Defiexplore.come says same.   I look on https://oasis.app/borrow/4056?network=mainnet I see no collateral, and no withdrawal.   I agree with you something is not consistent with your 4056 vault and apologize if it seemed I was telling you something different than what you appear to be seeing.    We will have to look into this one a bit.    Technically though 4056 auctions fall outside of the Black Thursday compensation analysis though.   That was the main thing I was confirming. Take a look at what defiexplore.com and oasis is telling us on 4056.   I see that collateral should have been returned but I don\u2019t see it. As to why you see things twice I think because you are seeing the tend and dent. From my dataset. 4420|50|3819.6750|4|42.3704840455724| |\u2014|---|\u2014|---| 4478|50|3819.6980|2|42.7444404918473| 4588|50|3819.6980|2|42.7444423695052| 4590|10|763.9390|2|8.54888847390104| 1st number auction, 2nd ETH lot offered, 3rd 1.13*tab to be covered, 4 bids, 5 amount of ETH sold There can be more bids both in tend and dent phases.   My data doesn\u2019t discriminate between bids in tend or dent and just calls them all bids.   I am not sure how defiexplore.com is determining what is a bid or not.   I will have to ask my guy about how number of bids is determined to get a better idea. ",

We will have to look into this one a bit. Technically though 4056 auctions fall outside of the Black Thursday compensation analysis though. That was the main thing I was confirming.   Thanks for confirming that something is amiss here and for looking into it further. I know the focus is for now the 0 bids, but this isn\u2019t correct neither. Would this be part of the BT compensation analysis? Thanks for clearing up the double bids. ",

We are discussing how to approach setting the class in terms of time limits as I know out to auction 4700ish Maker was still getting impaired auction performance but ultimately the time frame and conditions for whether a vault meets a compensation standard will be determined by them.   a lot of auctions during your time frame (after 4324 and before say 4700) only netted 10-12% collateral return.   Some of the larger auctions 500ETH netted barely 2-3% for the vault holder.   There still seems to be some debate as to the reason.   whether this an auction time thing or size.   Your auction was rather small so it matched performance of other auctions of your size. Sad welcome to both you @openforbusiness and @Damas as first time posters.

Use defiexplore in conjunction with the Liquidation and Compensation Report posted above to determine if \u2018you might be in the class\u2019. When I tell people they are in the class it just means they were one of the vaults that liquidated during the BT time frame chosen (auctions 763-4325).  Ultimately governance via on-chain poll will have to decide what qualifies a vault for possible compensation.   They may change the time frame or conditions to qualify.    The above was simply a report so governance could make these decisions and in the compensation report to attempt to quantify the possible cost involved for some basic scenarios. Example:    DeFi Explore    Defi Explore - MakerDAO MCD stats The easy way to check MakerDAO MCD positions and system stats.       with this auction https://defiexplore.com/liquidation/ETH/1700 is in the BT class as defined in the above report because auction 1700 falls between 763-4325.
