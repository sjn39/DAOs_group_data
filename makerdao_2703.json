On a per collateral basis, the cost of capital should be known (and only really change when the risks associated with that collateral shift) and then the DSR crosses all collateral. At least this was the last cycle of what I understood. There are discussions about removing the base rate. @Primoz no doubt has a better handle on that.     Jiecut:  IMO the DSR is quite a weak lever considering all the yield farming going on.   I am no expert on yield farming. However with any inefficient market that generates a yield (e.g. algo trading)\u2026 the incremental returns decline over time. The DSR however, really is not trying to compete in that space. As a synthetic US Dollar, it can be marketed and acquired by anyone wishing to do commerce and earn a core return (which is probably better than many other currencies vs. their local inflation). ",

If so, then the opposite is true that be reducing the SF we incentivize Vaults to be opened. Right now we are dealing w/ a yield farming phenomena and a loose (intentional) monetary policy, unlike last year that required tightening. Most all of these issue point to the need for additional \u201ctools in the toolbox\u201d to a address the situation. To your point, if the only DAI users are those that are farmers, they are going to be price inelastic showing virtually complete indifference to a rate change. That said, there is a subset of users that are the yield farmers, not all. ",
