The community is struggling to determine a future for the liquidity mining program.

If this temperature check passes, I would like to do the following: (1) Solicit volunteers for this group in the forums (2) Determine an ideal structure for the working group and specific work product through a series of dedicated Zoom calls (3) Create a governance proposal to formally acknowledge the working group and its structure Link to snapshot: https://snapshot.page/#/uniswap/proposal/QmWoBCx1sgUE21RQbRcK2gcBS5sS4PKPcthNtauzJ1SAUf Note: The snapshot starts at 5pm ET on Friday November 13th and ends at 5pm ET on Sunday November 15th ",

So, yes, a working group with a precise issue will be more efficient. Unfortunately, the Snapshot page won\u2019t let me vote, not sure why ? Do you need to delegate the UNI to vote on snapshot too ? In my personal view, we should cut at least ONE of the stables. And implement UNI-ETH LP incentivization. On top of that, slow down the current rewards (inflation) rate. ",
