                    "content": " MIP40c3-SP48: Strategic Finance MKR Compensation (SF-001)  Preamble MIP40c3-SP#: 48 Author(s): Mark Phillips (@Aes) Contributors: Tags: core-unit, cu-sf-001, budget, mkr-budget, active Status: Accepted Date Applied: 2021-12-07 Date Ratified: 2022-01-24 Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp48-strategic-finance-unit-mkr-compensation-sf-001/12060   Sentence Summary MIP40c3-SP48 adds the MKR Incentive Plan budget for Core Unit SF-001: Strategic Finance.  Paragraph Summary This proposal contains:  Team MKR Compensation Plan Payment Implementation  Our proposal is based on \u201cAlternative MKR Compensation Guidelines\u201d by @Aes, but it also uses elements from \u201cAn (Alternative) MKR Compensation Plan\u201d made by the SES Core Unit.  Permanent Team MKR Compensation Plan We used \u201cAlternative MKR Compensation Guidelines\u201d (currently a MIP in RFC phase) by myself, @Aes, and elements of SES \u201cAn (Alternative) MKR Compensation Plan\u201d to calculate MKR compensation rewards and distribution schedule for FS-001 members. Core Units contributors that have MKR compensation already approved through the Real-World Finance Core Unit (RWF-001) MKR compensation budget maintain the same MKR allocation and retroactive vesting dates, detailed below.  Vesting Details     Property Value     MKR/USD lock-in Price (New) Trailing 2-month average   MKR/USD lock-in Price (OG) MKR = $2,605 (10/1/21 - 12/1/21)   Vesting Period 3 years   Cliff Vest 12 months   Vesting Schedule After the cliff has expired, the quarterly MKR amount vests every 3 months and is distributed on July/Oct/Jan/Apr 1st, depending on each individual full-time onboarding   Manual Repricing yes   Auto-Renewal yes   Estimated Max Total team MKR After 1 Year (4 FTE) 320   Estimated Max Total team MKR After 3 Years (4 FTE) 960    * Note that this estimation is based on all 4 FTEs joining the Strategic Finance Core Unit on day 1. There are currently only 2 FTEs working for the Financial Strategy Core Unit which reduces the actual amount of MKR expended for SF-001 vesting (estimated currently at 160 MKR per year). If the MKR price increases significantly from current levels, the amount of MKR tokens allocated to new contributors will decrease. Manual repricing allows any contributor of SF-001 to calculate a new MKR/USD lock-in price using the trailing 2-month average. This ensures that contributors who join during a bull market aren\u2019t penalized relative to new contributors who join later during a bear market. In order to prevent abuse, manual repricing will reset the 12-month cliff vest period.  Current Team MKR Vesting Schedule     Date MKR Total     April 2022 80   July 2022 20   September 2022 80   October 2022 20   December 2022 20   January 2023 20   March 2023 20   April 2023 20   June 2023 20   July 2023 20   September 2023 20   October 2023 20   December 2023 20   January 2024 20   March 2024 20   April 2024 20   June 2024 20   September 2024 20     Two New Hires Forecasted Vesting Schedule     Date MKR Total     March 2023 160   June 2023 40   September 2023 40   December 2023 40   March 2024 40   June 2024 40   September 2024 40   December 2024 40   March 2025 40    This covers the total vesting schedule of 3 years for the planned 4 FTEs. On average, the team MKR vesting schedule yields 80 MKR per FTE per year, or 320 MKR in total per year.  Payment Implementation The Strategic Finance Core Unit will leverage DssVest with individual contributor vesting schedules. MKR payment for DSSVest #1 & #2 will be for the time the SF-001 contributors were in RWF-001. New hire MKR will be allocated from the 84,000.1 MKR treasury controlled by MakerDAO. Vesting schedule will be posted monthly for transparency. Unallocated MKR will be returned to the DAO. Two DSSVest implementation will be created immediately after the approval of this MIP: DSSVest #1  Contributor: @Aes  Wallet: 0xBC7fd5AA2016C3e2C8F0dBf4e919485C6BBb59e2 Total MKR over the vesting plan: 80*3 Duration: 3 years Start date: 2021-09-01 Cliff date: 2022-09-01  DSSVest #2:  Contributor: @SebVentures  Wallet: 0xcc81578d163a04ea8d2eae6904d0c8e61a84e1bb Total MKR over the vesting plan: 80*3 Duration: 3 years Start date: 2021-04-01 Cliff date: 2022-04-01  Payment: based on predetermined MKR compensation schedule Asset type: MKR Address: 0x387Cde8598E1CBb297FDc5bAEbA5E5c5c2735344 ",

Assuming MKR price trends up over-time, a six-month average could potentially massively over-allocate MKR to new contributors if there is a sudden spike in MKR value. The standard in TradFi is to value the package on the day of the grant, which for this proposal would make virtually no difference.  image1042\u00d7415 46.9 KB  Source: Coinmarketcap I volunteered a significant amount of time collaborating with CU facilitators and community members on attempting to standardize a MKR compensation plan but there has been little appetite among the community for doing so. Even trying to pass very broad guidelines was contested. I would be thrilled if another community member picked up this initiative and tried to standardize MKR comp.     juan:  Something a bit more unfair (when the principles from SES\u2019 framework) is that a new hire would also be getting the same amount 80, which is the same that Aes and Seb locked almost a year ago when the average trailing price was much lower.

Ideally I would like a more flat compensation structure, and bringing on very talented individuals who are driven and proven to drive value. For this type of individual I would say 60-70 MKR per year is a rough estimate. The ideal candidate for the Sr Manager position, for example, is someone that has a decade of experience working in Corporate Finance on a \u2018VP+ path\u2019. At my last company, this person is someone making ~160-190K base + benefits + 20-40% cash bonus + 20% stock bonus. This is a top bucket performer in TradFi and their compensation gets significantly more lucrative at the Director, Sr Director, and VP levels (as cash and stock bonuses continue scaling faster than base). From a purely monetary perspective, the MKR comp provides a higher risk/reward vs the cash bonus + stock bonus + consistent raises they would receive in TradFi. To provide additional company, the stock at my last company has performed extremely well over the past five years, it is a \u2018mega\u2019 cap company (>$200B valuation) and does not have the potential to 10x in the next three years (as MKR conceivably could).  On the flip side, I could envision hiring the right junior employee and paying them 20 MKR or less. ",

From my experience over the past year as a participant in the DAO and speaking with other CU members, I believe the following characteristics will be important for success on this team:  Entrepreneurial mindset - we are a young organization and growing fast, there is tremendous opportunity here Independent & strong critical thinker - without a traditional hierarchy dictating projects and tasks it\u2019s important to be a self-starter and assess what work can add the most value for the DAO Thick-skin - ability to handle criticism without taking it personally - you are exposed to anonymous members who may be very critical of your work  Some of the challenges recruiting the ideal candidate are:  Poaching them from a position where they have strong upward trajectory and comp that scales significantly as you reach Sr Manager+ - The MKR compensation requires a leap of faith as it is highly volatile Additional administrative work through owning one\u2019s own business (setting up personal entity, health care, accounting, taxes, etc.) Transition to a completely new and novel organizational structure, without a \u2018formal\u2019 contract Legal/Regulatory/Compliance uncertainty in the industry Volatility in the industry  With that said, I plan on shilling them on the benefits on joining MakerDAO and the crypto industry:  Working on the cutting edge of technology and finance Pioneering a completely new way of working Ability to make a significant impact and add substantial value Supporting the future of clean and sustainable energy financing Tremendous financial upside if MKR succeeds  Happy to add to the list if you have any suggestions as well.

These new streams will be implemented via an Executive Vote when possible, it is too late to include them in the proposal for this week. We will discuss with PE when they will be able to implement the new streams. @MIP-Editors can we ensure that a note is added to the proposal to indicate that manual repricing has occurred? I do have a minor implementation question. I wonder if the stream for contributor #2 might warrant a different start date. As this individual\u2019s original stream has already met the cliff date, if we yank the first stream and set up the new stream backdated to 2022-08-05, there will be an intermediate period where this contributor has two streams vesting MKR they can claim, as the yank will only take effect when the spell executes. In effect, this period will see them with two concurrent vesting streams. If it\u2019s ok with you and your contributor, I would suggest that we use the date of the relevant spell going live + 2 days as the start of the new stream to guard against double spend? ",
