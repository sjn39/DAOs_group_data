Same goes for tokens like USDC with backdoors. As always, all legit and non-scam tokens should eventually be included in the collateral portfolio since that is the best outcome for diversification and dai stability. It\u2019s a matter of when it gets included and which risk parameters it gets by the risk framework, not whether it will be included at all  Digix confirmed, can\u2019t find the link anywhere now, they are working with Maker to get DGX in MCD eventually.

For example: does the token contract implement standard ERC20 behavior? From this perspective, DGX is a complicated contract that requires significant technical analysis, DGD is not.

                    "content": "I agree with you entirely @MicahZoltu - having DGX (a gold backed token) at least makes some sense. Using the governance token that allegedly backs the gold token does not make a lot of sense to me. My largest concerns:  A DAO token might need to move to another token (example old vs new MKR token) and this would create additional risks. Any token that is used for voting presents a risk to the DAO itself. DGD is currently sitting at 40 million USD market cap - which means even if a crazy 10% of all DGD tokens were locked in MKR, this would do nearly nothing for the market cap of Dai. DGD has lost 96% of it\u2019s value against Bitcoin in the past 16 months. It has lost a similar amount against ETH  In summary - DGD is not liquid, not stable, not likely to grow in value and remain successful, not large enough (by market cap) and not worth the complex risks for the tiny reward. I am strongly against adding this token, and I would recommend that we wait and see if the Digix DAO is still active and safe and well managed before we add it. ",
