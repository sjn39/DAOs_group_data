After this date, the contract will no longer allow the creation of new orders. At the same time, anyone will be able to cancel any order placed with this contract. An upgraded version of OasisDEX \u2013 OasisDEX 1.1 \u2013 will be deployed prior to the old contract\u2019s expiration date. OasisDEX 1.1 implements minimal changes that remove any remaining \u201cadmin\u201d functions, including the expiration date.
