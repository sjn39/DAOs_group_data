Thanks to our coordinated efforts (including former Head of Business Development @g_dip , former China Lead @Chao.Pan , former Europe & Asia BD @Gustav_Arentoft , and @rune (especially for crucial Chinese expansions)), Dai and Maker are integrated to various major entities ranging from major exchanges to dApps to high-level corporate experiments in Asia. Awareness and reputation of MakerDAO has increased as well. The landscape in Asia is changing especially due to recently enforced regulations especially in China and Korea. This is both risk and opportunity for MakerDAO to potentially fill the change and expand. I have full confidence that @joce_chang will be able to take such opportunity as well. My resignation from Maker Growth CU is so that I can focus more on delegate work, reduce conflict of interest, and help Growth CU\u2019s budget. I will likely spend days in July to redistribute all of business connections / deals as much as possible. And we are still looking for replacement for me so if you know any good candidates for Growth contributor based in Asia, please ping me, Jocelyn, or Nadia. Thank you Maker Community for everything and expect me to be more active in Maker Governance. ",

Sad that you will no longer serve Maker in Korea as there can be no doubt about the impact you\u2019ve had on the success there over years. You leave some big shoes to fill. Wonderful because that means you can focus fully on being a delegate. Since you\u2019ve joined I\u2019ve been impressed by your attention to detail and omnipresence on the forum. You must have some kind of record in being the first to comment on posts. It\u2019s also great to see a delegate take personal responsibility in reducing their conflict of interest. Personally I\u2019m looking forward to many interesting debates and to keep working with you for the betterment of the protocol. ",
