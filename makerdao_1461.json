I feel it may be because capital is being more \u201canalytical\u201d when buying certain cryptos, this is normal in bear markets. I am not surprised in what is for me the \u201cStablecoin Summer\u201d in which we will undoubtedly be with the next participants in the ecosystem, it would be interesting to see how the movement would be. For now DAI and USDC are the favorite stablecoins to open a Liquidity pair against another stablecoin or another crypto and that gives us certainty between the lines of what the market is looking for. USDT basically does not have its market in the DEFI sector, it is traded more in centralized exchanges or by TRON. ",

Moving a significant amount of USDC from the PSM to Protocol-owned DAI/USDC 1bps LP on Uni v3 could help to make acquiring DAI easier for small users, while bringing increased revenue for the protocol. While lending DAI may technically be safer than protocol-owned liquidity, the risk of USDC falling to partial collateralization is likely far lower than it falling to no collateralization (which lending does not save us from).
