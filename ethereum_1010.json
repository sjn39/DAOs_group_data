Improved design over ERC1538 using ABIEncoderV2 and function selectors. Abstract A diamond is a contract that implements this standard. A diamond provides the following:  A way to add, replace and remove multiple functions atomically (in the same transaction). An event that shows what functions are added, replaced, removed and one or messages describing changes. A way to look at a diamond to show its functions. Solves the 24KB maximum contract size limitation. Diamonds can be any size. Enables zero, partial or full contract immutablity as desired, and when desired. Designed for tooling and user-interface software.  A diamond is a proxy contract that supports using multiple logic/delegate contracts at the same time. In this standard the term for logic/delegate contract is facet. A diamond can have many facets. Which facet is used depends on which function is called. Each facet supplies one or more functions. This standard supersedes ERC1538: Transparent Contract Standard. See the full standard here: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2535 ",

I guess I\u2019ll have to reconsider  More seriously. Your proposed implementation is lacking ways to delegate the receive and the fallback functions. I think this is an essential feature to have! But has they don\u2019t have dedicated function selector, you need to be a bit creative. See my ERC1538 implementation. To me it feals like a nice sugar coating on top of ERC1538, with a wording that makes it more easily understandable. But in term of functionnality, I don\u2019t really see what is the added benefit.

Probably most of what you write about ERC1538 applies to the diamond standard.  I am sorry about coming out with the newer standard. I thought of just updating ERC1538 but it was a lot of fancy clothes to put on. I will look into the what you are talking about for delegating to receive and fallback. I don\u2019t want the standard to miss any essential things. You are right, the diamond standard is the same contract architecture as ERC1538.  I like to think of the diamond standard as ERC1538 wearing fancy clothes. I\u2019ll be looking into your ERC1538 implementation soon. I really appreciate this valuable feedback. ",
