It works by transferring EIP-3754 vanilla NFTs with unicoded tokenIds in a batch sort of like transferring tokens in ERC1155, however, the ordering information in this case shall be maintained. This is particularly efficient and useful for emojis and languages that are based on logographs  such as hanzi in Mandarin, kanji in Japanese, hanja in Korean, and etc, given their simplicity and conciseness in expressing meanings. As far as I know, this is a new application. Is there already similar use cases? Thanks. ",
