                    "content": "Hello Core Units  It seems as though those of you involved with collateral onboarding are using this framework to prioritize applications. I think I speak for everyone who has submitted a MIP6 application when I say that the objectivity and clarity is greatly appreciated. It takes a lot of guesswork out of making an application and creates a better experience for everyone. In the framework there seem to be three categorizations for each column which contribute to an overall score: \u201clow,\u201d \u201cmedium,\u201d and \u201chigh.\u201d It would be really helpful if each Core Unit could write up a quick methodology of how they arrive at each of the three categorizations for their relevant columns in the sheet. These are the following columns and the core units responsible for them: @Nadia Growth CU  PR Benefit PR Risk  @Primoz Risk  Dai Supply Fees Generated Diversification Credit/Market Risk Custodial Risk Legal Risk (seems to be excluded) Asset Setup Risk (seems to be excluded) Difficulty  @Derek PE  Risk Difficulty  @NikKunkel Oracles  Risk Difficulty  @SebVentures RWF  Risk Difficulty  My ask is that there\u2019s some sort of clarity around what, in general, causes you to provide a low, medium or high rating. I know you\u2019re all very busy, but I\u2019d like to stress how helpful it would be for potential and current applicants to have more clarify around these items. Thank you for your consideration.

In terms of how the scoring is determined and calibrated, please see the relevant section in the doc:  As collateral types can differ considerably, it is important to note that the score given to a metric is not based on any particular, predefined, external criteria. Rather the scoring is undertaken on a case by case basis, using the judgment, interpretation, and experience of the members of the Risk Core Unit.  There is no predefined formula that we use. It is instead up to the judgment and experience of the team members in the Risk Core Unit, as well as the questions and considerations that we outline further down in the document, that serves as a basis for scoring individual metrics.

                    "content": "The protocol engineering team reviews collateral by assessing a combination of technical criteria in order to determine overall risk and difficulty. High, medium or low classifications for a particular collateral type are difficult to rigidly apply because a variation on any particular parameter could be considered a reg flag that increases the overall risk classification. In this sense, our assessments are very situational and similar to a typical smart contract audit. For example, a standard ERC20 token with no additional functionality may potentially be classified as low, whereas if we identify a non-standard implementation, authorisation (for example a multisig on the token), it may be considered medium. If any additional code work would be required, if the code is not verified on Etherscan, or there is an external dependency on an oracle, then this could be considered higher or high risk. Note, this is merely an example to share the thinking involved. As per our technical assessments, the following non exhaustive list and elaborations encompass criteria that we take into account to build an overall feel of the risk and difficulty: Audits:  Was the contract externally audited? Was the contract internally audited and a self-audit provided? Is the project\u2019s technical documentation available?  Verification:  Is the contract verified on Etherscan? Does the contract have overflow checks?  Authorizations:  What contract permits exist? Are there external owners or keys? What privileges do external owners have?  Functionality:  What code libraries are being used? What other functions are allowed? What other implementations exist? What Token Standards are implemented? Does the contract have an upgradability patterns?  Integration  Can existing token adapters be used?  Formal Verification Considerations  Are there any concerns regarding token semantics? Are there any Oracle implications? Are there any external calls or other risks (including complex inheritance structures)?  These criteria are not fixed or exhaustive and will be added to overtime depending on the token types being reviewed. ",
