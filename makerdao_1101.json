Educate the University of Chicago campus and the broader University community about the Maker project + facilitate collaboration on new Maker initiatives. Help MakerDAO continue to build a sustainable and enduring community that enables the creation of a more financially free and sustainable future for all.   Delegate Statement GM! We are ChicagoDAO, a burgeoning DAO at The University of Chicago that connects the various blockchain clubs and communities on campus. As of now, we currently have representation from students in the undergraduate college, law school, and business school. We have \u224825 core contributors and \u2248150 community members. We will be opening up our DAO to alumni and the broader campus over the summer and have numerous initiatives we will be working on this summer, from creating a bespoke DAO tooling platform to planning a conference in fall. Our current working groups include a Dev team, Trade/Quant Team, Internal Ops Team, Outreach Team, Research team, and an External Governance team. Our delegated tokens are managed by our External Governance team. Within this team each protocol has one to two protocol leads who keep the broader team abreast of new developments and are the central point of contact for that protocol. We meet weekly to discuss new proposals and vote in a simple, equal weighted ballot where each measure must have two-thirds of the External Governance team voting \u2018yes\u2019 to pass. Currently we have Compound and Uniswap delegated from a16z. We are excited to get started with Maker soon! Our discussions bring together students from varying backgrounds and areas of expertise. On our External Governance team we have multiple developers with experience on different blockchains, experienced traders, former and aspiring lawyers, former financial regulators, public policy analysts and more. We believe that this diversity of backgrounds allows us to have a holistic view of protocols and the potential impact of new proposals. Our key initiatives within the External Governance team are to:  Stay abreast of new developments within each protocol Actively participate in discussions and votes for all proposals Draft and put forward new proposals when appropriate Be an evangelist for the protocols and communities we are involved with  As delegates, we will be reliable stewards and work diligently to ensure the future growth and success of MakerDAO. By delegating to ChicagoDAO you are affirming the value of interdisciplinary teams and partnerships across industry and academia.  Conflicts of Interest  ChicagoDAO takes part in governance of other projects. Currently these are Uniswap and Compound  We have read and agree to abide by the Delegate Code of Conduct.

Makes you think why market participants are leaving the product, doesn\u2019t look positive to me, and maybe we shouldn\u2019t commit $100M towards it for next 4 years?   I wanted to clarify that the Debank address you linked is only for one of the OUSD strategies, this one is the Compound strategy. Etherscan confirms the total AUM and OUSD on-chain analytics confirm that the remaining AUM after Compound are spread between the four other OUSD strategies.

This proposal includes proposed launch parameters for Compound D3M and changes to MANA-A risk parameters. Activate Compound V2 D3M with the following parameters:  <= 160M debt ceiling 10M gap 2% bar  We agree with the explanation and logic for the parameters outlined in the proposal. The following parameters are also updated  Decrease the MANA-A debt ceiling to 10 million, Increase the MANA-A stability fee to 7.5%  As outlined in the proposal, the changes to the parameters are to help incentivize the reduction of exposure to more manageable levels. Takeaway: The PPG continues to produce a quality analysis of market conditions and sound parameter changes that mitigates risk for the protocol and community.   Activate Liquidations for Stablecoin Vaults to Clear Bad Debt - October 31, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Yes Summary: Activate liquidations for USDC-A & USDP-A Stablecoin Vaults to Clear Bad Debt (BD). The Vaults holding unbacked DAI originate from liquidation functions being disabled. Although the BD is no longer accruing because the stability fee \u2013 variable-rate fee continuously added to a Vault owner\u2019s generated Dai balance \u2013 was set to 0, The vaults still sit with BD. To clear the bad debt and balance the vaults, the adjustment of unbacked DAI in the amount of ~1.3M would come from the DAOs surplus buffer.  The surplus buffer is the amount of DAI that accrues to the protocol from stability fee revenue prior to auctions being triggered. The proposal noted that the surplus buffer amounts to ~ 77,4M DAI and burning the unbacked DAO (balancing the amounts) Delta is 1.68% of the total. Counter Arguments: The vaults are not worth paying back right now unless the collateral is required to maintain the stability of the protocol. It might make sense to leverage gain from yields to slowly or at once liquidate the vaults. This is a valid argument, and we are not opposed to it. However, our position under the current operating and market conditions is to activate liquidation for the vaults. Takeaway: Although this bad debt is not a priority to clear, it should be noted that sound accounting and risk management practices take precedence within the protocol.   One Month Budget Extension for Strategic Happiness Core Unit - October 31, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: No Summary: Although we appreciate the enthusiasm of the mandate for this core unit. A decision was previously made to offboard. Swag is important as it helps to produce name recognition. But, under current market conditions, we will not be supporting this vote. As Mahatma Gandhi is quoted, \u201cHappiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do in harmony.\u201d Your impact on positivity and happiness stems far past this proposal. Thank you for your hard work.  Takeaway: Under current operating and market conditions. This proposal does not make sense. ",

Ceiling Increase Cooldown (ttl): 12 hours.  Target Borrow Rate (bar): 2%.  A compound D3M will allow Maker to inject DAI liquidity into compound V2 producing yield. The Vault parameters have been worked through by multiple core units - outlined below - we believe an adequate amount of diligence was completed on this proposal and it is beneficial for the protocol As outlined in the voting portal, the mechanics of implementation and outcomes were assessed by the following core units to provide all necessary information:  Initial Risk Core Unit Maker Open Market Committee (MOMC) Protocol Engineering Core Unit Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit  Further Information 1. Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) - The Maximum Debt Ceiling refers to the maximum value for Debt Ceiling that the DC-IAM will allow in the given vault type. 2. Target Available Debt (gap) - The Target Available Debt parameter controls how much of a gap the DC-IAM aims to maintain between the current debt usage and the Debt Ceiling of the vault type. 3. Ceiling Increase Cooldown (ttl) - The Ceiling Increase Cooldown parameter controls how frequently the DC-IAM can increase the Debt Ceiling. 4. Target Borrow Rate (bar) - The Target Borrow Rate allows Maker Governance to set the \u2018ideal\u2019 rate for borrowing DAI on the target lending protocol. Takeaway: Maker and stakeholders continue to encourage the adoption of the Maker protocol through expansion and proven methods. ",

Use Linear Decrease for Auction Price Function (calc). Set Liquidation Penalty (chop) to 0. Set Proportional Kick Incentive (chip) to 0. Set Flat Kick Incentive (tip) to 0. Set Auction Price Multiplier (buf) to 1. Set tau to 4,320,000 seconds (72,000 minutes, or 1,200 hours). This results in an estimated 10bps drop in price every 72 minutes, or 50 days until the price reaches 0. Set Max Auction Duration (tail) to 43,200 seconds (720 minutes, or 12 hours). This implies a minimum price of 0.99. Set Max Auction Drawdown (cusp) to 0.99. Individually set the Local Liquidation Limit (ilk.hole) for the vault types as follows:  USDC-A - 20 million DAI USDP-A - 3 million DAI GUSD-A - 300,000 DAI    More Information:   Linear Decrease \u2013 An auction using a Linear Decrease Auction Price Function starts at the Auction Price Multiplier. The price will fall linearly to $0.   Auction Price Function (calc) \u2013 The Auction Price Function specifies how the collateral auction price varies over time.   Liquidity penalty \u2013 The Liquidation Penalty parameter regulates the fee vault owners must pay for inadequate collateral.   Flat Kick Incentive (tip) \u2013 Flat Kick Incentive is a DAI reward paid to keepers who trigger Maker Protocol collateral liquidation auctions.   Auction Price Multiplier (buf) \u2013 Auction Price Multiplier multiplies the auction\u2019s beginning price.   tau \u2013 A figure in seconds that governs how long an auction takes to reach   Max Auction Duration (tail) \u2013 Maximum Auction Duration determines the maximum duration before a vault auction must restart. This value, expressed in seconds, defines when an auction must be reset.   Max Auction Drawdown (cusp) \u2013 Maximum Auction Drawdown is the maximum collateral price decline   Local Liquidation Limit (ilk.hole) \u2013 The Local Liquidation Limit determines the maximum amount of DAI debt for which collateral auctions may be engaged in a vault type (ilk).

All investments will be made on the open market via arms-length, competitive processes facilitated by investment banks and/or broker-dealers.  Takeaway: We Support the community moving forward with the necessary assessment to onboard MIP90. There needed to be more clarity around whether or not this was a greenlight poll. Our decision assumes this is not the final vote, but rather approves the required assessment to move forward to the \u201cnext stage\u201d of the process.   Offboarding Parameters for renBTC-A - November 21, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Yes Summary: The industry has had many impacts around the recent market events - FTX collapse. One impact, or potential impact, is REN. Alameda & FTX played a large role in REN effectively owning the protocol. To mitigate risk for the protocol, a decision is going forward to offboard renBTCA under the following parameters:   Liquidation Penalty (chop): 0%.  Flat Kick Incentive (tip): 0 DAI.  Liquidation Ratio (mat): 5000%.  Local Liquidation Limit (ilk.hole): 350,000 DAI.  We agree with the need to mitigate this risk from the users and protocol. The offboarding parameters seem logical and in line with prior actions. Takeaway: Maker is keeping up with market conditions and updating parameters as needed to avoid any fallout from recent market events.   Add Multiple BlockTower Credit Vault Types (RWA010, RWA011, RWA012, RWA013) - November 21, 2022  Vote Decision: Yes Summary: This vote is in support of a previous poll. We generally support RWA exposure in conservative financial instruments. There has been an adequate review of the application and risk education from all relevant core units seen below:  Initial Collateral Application Commercial and Legal Risk Evaluation Part 1 Commercial and legal Risk Evaluation Part 2 Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit Evaluation Protocol Engineering Core Unit Commentary  We look forward to further discussion and seeing the impact Blocktower will have on the protocol. Takeaway: Maker is moving forward with prior commitments. Please see the V Parameters outlined in summary, here.   Add GNO (GnosisDAO) as a new Vault Type - November 21, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Yes Summary: This poll sets to add Gnosis as a new Vault Type within the Maker Protocol. Gnosis has a long-running reputation within the Ethereum & EVM ecosystem. While Safe has recently spun off from Gnosis, Gnosis provides a unique opportunity to engage with one of the most well-known and financially healthy DAOs in the space. As outlined in the application, Gnosis DAO has supported the Maker protocol and leveraged vaults for over a year. This is a reasonable next step forward for Gnosis and Maker. We are excited to see the ongoing developments between Gnosis & Maker, especially GNO as the use of collateral. Please see the relevant analysis below:   Risk Core Unit Evaluation.  Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit Evaluation.  Oracles Core Unit Evaluation.  Growth Core Unit Evaluation.  Takeaway: Maker is identifying high-value collateral to be used within its protocol. Although market conditions are inadequate, GNO is widely used within the Gnosis ecosystem. ",

It is important to note that this is a repeat vote just 7 months after a failed attempt. Although these contributions are clearly above the typical contributor, there is a documented history of negative behavior that indicates this vote is coming too soon. Also, with the changes coming from EGP, this is just not the right time. This is not a permanent no. Rather, a gap in time to rebuild. We hope to see continued support for the protocol. Thank you for all the contributions to date.   Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Development and UX Core Unit (DUX-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP82) - November 14, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Option 2: Approve reduction in budget Summary: This vote proposes modification in Dev/UX CU budget. The options are below:  Option 0: Abstain. Option 1: Approve existing budget only (Business as usual): 1,871,300 DAI Option 2: Approve reduced budget (NewBase): 1,611,420 DAI Option 3: Approve reduced budget (NewBear): 1,426,416 DAI Option 4: Reject budget.  The Core Unit recognizes the community\u2019s active discussions regarding cost reduction and proposes budget adjustments accordingly. We agree with conservative and realistic budget streams for CUs.   Ratification Poll for CoinShares Active Treasury Management (MIP86) - November 14, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: No Summary:  Under MIP86, a portion (from $100M to $500M) of the PSM\u2019s USDCs will be managed by CoinShares, which will invest on behalf of MakerDAO the funds in various traditional financial assets according to MIP13c3-SP12 3 12.  Coinshares is a leader in the space and perfectly capable of managing funds, we enjoyed the proposal and thoroughness of the investment program. However, the macro and internal operating environments do not support this program. From a macro perspective, there is an unknown around the tradfi economy and web3 economy. Internally, the maker is preparing to embark on a long transformation journey. We welcome this proposal back when the market and operating conditions are complimentary to the program.   Ratification Poll for OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) - November 14, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: No Summary: Maker to deploy 100M of USDC to OUSD and earn continuous yield while retaining full custody. OUSD rebases and dist yield (interest, fees, incentives) directly to users in the form of additional OUSD proportionally daily. 30 day trailing avg apy is 5.82%. $100M USDC from PSM into OUSD. In addition to daily yields, Origin will also give up to 3% current total supply of governance token OGV. 1% of initial OGV supply (40M) over 4 years for as long as the balance is not below $100M OUSD. Risks are in the underlying systems, including lending/AMM, stablecoin protocols and Origin protocol/governance (rely on few strategists to execute rebalancing). Lastly, the market conditions do not support this proposal. However, there will be opportunities in the future for further collaboration. We support Origin and its activities. We look forward to seeing them develop TVL and further break into more protocols.   Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Mandate (MIP39c2-SP38) - November 14, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Abstain Summary: This proposal is reasonable, however, fails to convey the pros and cons of the mandate change. Voting abstain as we believe this mandate change has potential, but needs to convey the change in clearer terms.   Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security (IS-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP83) - November 14, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Abstain Summary: Same as above. We believe the budget for this CU needs to be looked at more closely. We support ISCU and the valuable work completed.   Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Governance Communications Core Unit DAI Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP84) - November 14, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Option 1: Approve budget Summary: This vote proposes modification in Gov Comms CU. The options are below:  Option 1: Approve 258,807 DAI budget streamed over six months. Option 2: Reject budget.  We believe governance is at the heart of MakerDAO and the facilitators (including gov coms ) play a huge role in maintaining governance stability for the protocol. There are adequate pros and cons (drafted by David Utro) found in this forum post: The Future for GovComms \u2013 a message encouraging voters to pass our current budget proposal    Budget Ratification Poll for Modify TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget, TECH-001 (MIP40c3-SP86) - November 14, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Option 1: Approve Summary: This vote proposes modification in TechOps Core Uni budget. The options are below:  Option 1: Approve 749,685 DAI seed transfer and 2,398,988 DAI streamed over twelve months. Option 2: Reject budget.  As outlined in the proposal, the TechOps group covers a lot of ground and is needed for the end game to continue its path forward. The benefits outlined in the proposes align with the protocol.   Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit DAI Budget, SAS-001 (MIP40c3-SP85) - November 14, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Option 3: Reject budget. Summary: This vote proposes modification in Sidestram Auction Service CU budget. The options are below:  Option 1: Approve new base budget: 433,375 DAI seed transfer and 1,040,100 DAI streamed over twelve months. Option 2: Approve new bear budget: 394,562.50 DAI seed transfer and 946,950 DAI streamed over twelve months. Option 3: Reject budget.  Priority is on founding new development around the transformation for the protocol. Although this Core Unit achieved its goals and most of the roadmap, we recognize that focus needs to be changed/modified. We reject this budget as we continue to move forward with the protocol.   Ratification Poll for Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit (MIP84c10-SP1) - November 14, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: No Summary:  This is a proposal to increase the emulated surplus buffer upper limit to 1B DAI. This would prevent the Protocol Owned Vault Emulation (POVE) described in MIP84 7 from purchasing staked ETH assets until the surplus buffer reaches approximately 1B Dai  Whereas we agree with maintaining a liquid asset to protect the protocol, we disagree with the timing and overall parameters. We believe it is just too early to explore these parameters. Happy to revisit this at a later date.   Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Redwood Friesian (MIP88) - November 14, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: No Summary:  MIP88 onboards a DAI 225M RWA vault that will acquire USDC via the PSM and acquire USD 225M of a super senior, front cash flow, AAAsf (or equivalent) rated RMBS on a bespoke basis (see Key Terms below). In addition, the transaction will be structured to provide 15% credit enhancement at closing for the super senior bonds.  Generally, RWA exposure is a positive for the protocol where adequate RM is applied. There is an unknown in the current macroeconomic market. There is a growing risk in the housing market. Because of this uncertainty, we voted no.   Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Arrow Andalusian (MIP89) - November 14, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Yes Summary:  \u201cMIP89 will onboard and activate a DAI 300M RWA vault and acquire BlackRock/ishares ETF products allocated in the same manner as MIP65, and, from this asset pool, finance and deploy over 12 months a set of wholesale, senior, secure, staged, Green Economy, Lending facility focused on the UK and the EU together with Arrow Global.\u201d    Budget Ratification Poll for Modify the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit DAI Budget, SES-001 (MIP40c3-SP87) - November 14, 2022  Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Option 2: Approve speedy operations platform option budget: Summary: This vote proposes modification in SES CU. The options are below:  Option 1: Approve standard option budget: 2,719,200 DAI streamed over twelve months. Option 2: Approve speedy operations platform option budget: 3,199,200 DAI streamed over twelve months. Option 3: Reject budget.  The Core Unit recognizes the community\u2019s active discussions regarding cost reduction and proposes budget adjustments accordingly. This CU is critical to the success of the transformation the DAO previously approved. Thus, this is one of the few times in a downward market where a large budget warrants attention. ",

This poll is not unfounded; the EG plan calls for a 2% savings rate. It is important to note that this is being done to make MAKER more attractive to all parties. Moreover, the saving rate is manageable and can be lowered. This is an important step forward as we look to the boundaries of the system and changes being made for the endgame. We will be monitoring the impacts of this update closely.  PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - November 28, 2022 Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Yes Summary: More great work by the PPG - Open Market Committee. We believe the protocol should take necessary steps to avoid certain risks arising from market conditions. For these reasons, we agree with the changes in parameters. Some highlights are the increases in WSTETH A/B and Reducing target available Debt for WSETH, WBTC, LINK, YFI. More information: Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) - refers to the maximum value for Debt Ceiling that the DC-IAM will allow in the given vault type. Target Available Debt (gap) - Controls how much of a gap the DC-IAM aims to maintain between the current debt usage and the Debt Ceiling of the vault type. Ceiling Increase Cooldown (ttl) - Controls how frequently the Debt Ceiling can be increased by the DC-IAM. Peg Stability Module (PSM) - Allows users to swap a given collateral type directly for DAI at a fixed rate. DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) - Allows DAI to be minted and deposited in other crypto lending protocols on the Ethereum blockchain in exchange for a deposit/collateral token from that lending protocol.  Undertake Necessary Risk and Legal Assessments to Increase the NS-DROP Debt Ceiling to 50 Million DAI - November 28, 2022 Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Yes Summary:  This Signal poll allows for the Strategic Finance Core Unit to move forward with Risk and Legal assessments on increasing the Debt Ceiling of the NS-DROP vault with the below parameters.  Adding in WSFS as the trustee, based on the Trust Indenture put together earlier this year by Christian Petersen and Eli Cohen. Increase Vault Debt Ceiling to 50 million DAI. Remove senior co-investor requirement and over-collateralization requirement Increase Junior minimum to 20% from 15% Increase Stability Fee to 4.5% from 3.5%   With current market conditions, it is reasonable to understand the risks of potentially increasing this debt ceiling. The proposed Term Sheet looks good. Company projections are reasonable, and we are pleased to view a summary of the portfolio overview. We are interested in Genesis Trading and its capacity to execute but look forward to seeing the findings of this assessment. ",

The current owner indicated her desire to stand aside from her position and duties with the program due to personal reasons. First off, we thank you @kat for everything you have done and contributed. This is an operational vote that we agree with. Thank you for stepping up @Sebix. You will do great.  Ratification Poll for Pioneer DeFi-focused Language Dataset for the Benefit of Risk Modelling & Governance Communication (MIP55c3-SP11) - December 12, 2022 Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Yes Summary: The request is to fund the aggregation of a DeFi-specific data set for Risk modeling. The data will be used to tune LLMs and should help drive more insightful decision-making for the CU. Coming from a Data modeling background, I am interested in exploring the aggregation of this data and look forward to reading about the progression of this endeavor.  Dai Foundation Board Member Election Poll - December 12, 2022 Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Abstain Summary: With the establishment of the Dai Foundation Core Unit, the Dai Foundation pledged to appoint MakerDAO members to its board. Earlier this year the organization reached out for potential candidates. The two choices were Daimon-Law and OxbocaJ. Both are very qualified candidates. Please see the candidate statements below: Daimon-Law: candidate statement here. OxbocaJ: candidate statement here. Ultimately, we cannot vouch for either candidate directly (among other things) and choose to recuse ourselves/abstain from the vote. We are confident in the ability of more experienced delegates to identify and select the correct candidates.

This proposal suggests reactivating the Aave D3M with a modest debt ceiling, increasing the Compound v2 D3M debt ceiling, gradually normalizing stability fees for the WSTETH-B vault type, and increasing fees on the USDP PSM to avoid growth in an exposure. Estimates indicate that these changes would lead to a roughly 525,000 DAI increase in annual revenue for the MakerDAO treasury. Takeaway: The proposed changes take into account the current market conditions and aim to increase the platform\u2019s utilization. Additionally, The proposal suggests gradually normalizing the stability fee on the WSTETH-B vault type to reach parity with ETH-C, aiming to drive new usage. Lastly, The 525,000 DAI increase in annual revenue for the MakerDAO treasury, would benefit the ecosystem. As always, we continue to support the critical work of the committee.  Request to Poll: One-time MKR Distribution to Correct CES-001 Incentive Program Shortfall Forum Discussion Vote Decision: Yes Summary: The Interim Collateral Engineering Services (CES) is proposing a one-time MKR distribution of 96.15 MKR to cover the deficiency in rewards for current contributors, as a result of the previous facilitator accelerating payouts to selected members before leaving. The distribution would be transferred to the CES Auditor Wallet to cover annual vesting awards for current members. Why we are voting yes: This proposal is a fair and necessary measure to align with the approved rewards program and ensure current contributors receive the expected awards. The deficiency was created by the previous facilitator\u2019s actions and this distribution will ensure current contributors are compensated for their contributions.  Poll Notice: Confirmation of Trial DssKiln Deployment Forum Discussion Vote Decision: (1) Burn .5 million DAO worth of MKR, (2) No burn Summary: The Facilitators of the GovAlpha, Protocol Engineering, and Risk Core Units are proposing a poll to confirm whether voters still wish to proceed with the trial deployment of DssKiln, a system for burning DAI worth of MKR that was previously approved through MIP74. The poll will ask voters to select from options including burning 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 million DAI worth of MKR or abstaining. The poll aims to gauge voter sentiment before proceeding with an executive vote and considers the passage of time since initial approval, changes in market sentiment and DAO priorities, and the fall in MKR price. Other information: MIP74, or the \u201cPermissionless Open Market Operations\u201d proposal, is a suggestion by the MakerDAO community to establish a system that allows anyone to mint or burn DAI without the need for permission from the MakerDAO community. This will be achieved by using a smart contract called the \u201cPermissionless OMO engine\u201d or POLE. This smart contract will determine the collateralization ratio at which minting and burning occur based on DAI\u2019s supply and demand in the open market. This approach is intended to assist in stabilizing the DAI/USD price by adjusting the monetary supply in response to market forces, making it more responsive and decentralized. It\u2019s important to note that the MIP74 proposal is considered experimental, and its implementation is more of a trial than a permanent solution. Takaway: This option reduces the potential risk and impact on the MKR token economy while still allowing for the trial deployment to proceed and gather valuable data on the effectiveness of burning MKR to stabilize the DAI peg. Additionally, by reducing the amount of MKR burned, it preserves more of the MKR token supply for future use. ",

The proposal aims to incorporate learnings from the beta test by more strictly defining payment processes, buffer reporting, and changing some parameters. Why we are voting Yes: This proposal is a critical step in improving the MIP63 Maker Keeper Network Amendment, which has already demonstrated success in its beta test. The changes proposed in this amendment will help refine and optimize the system, making it more efficient and effective. Additionally, the explicit stream duration and the ability for the Sequencer to set custom windows per network will provide greater flexibility and control over the system.  Ratification Poll for Defense Fund (MIP55c3-SP14) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: Yes Summary: This proposal is for creating a Defense Fund, which will be used to reimburse legal defense expenses for active participants of MakerDAO in case they are the target of legal or regulatory action. The fund will initially cover Recognized Delegates, Core Unit Facilitators, Core Unit permanent contributors, and Active MKR holders. The proposal also includes a plan for managing claims and payouts, which an external technical committee will oversee, and a minimum capital requirement for the fund. Why we are voting Yes: This proposal is important for protecting active participants of MakerDAO from potential legal risks associated with the novel organizational structure of DAOs. The Defense Fund will serve as a contingency budget to cover legal defense expenses, providing a safety net for those actively involved in the MakerDAO ecosystem. The plan for managing claims and payouts is well thought out, and the inclusion of insurance and risk management experts will ensure that the fund is managed responsibly and effectively.  Ratification Poll for Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn to earn Yield (MIP92) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: Yes Summary: MIP92 proposes onboarding $100M of PSM USDC into a bespoke non-custodial Yearn vault. Yearn vaults are risk-adjusted and transparent, and the proposed strategies for the bespoke vault are flexible. Assigned Yearn contributors will work closely with the relevant Maker Core Units as proposed in MIP92c5. Security measures: Yearn is an established and reputable organization known for its safety and transparency. Using on-chain vaults will empower the Maker community to audit the location and amounts of deposited assets continually. Yearn\u2019s risk-adjusted vaults are battle-tested and have handled an all-time high of $6.4 billion with no loss of funds. Proposed strategies: The composition of the bespoke vault is flexible, and Yearn contributors in coordination with the relevant Maker Core Units will propose strategies. Maintenance and Upkeep: Yearn is maintained by a team of full-time contributors and is governed by the YFI token. Why we are voting Yes: This is a significant step in generating a yield on idle USDC while ensuring safety and transparency. Yearn is uniquely positioned to offer Maker yield-generation opportunities, and its reputation and track record in DeFi make it a reliable choice. Yearn aligns with Maker\u2019s safety-first strategy, and using its vaults will further validate the case for decentralized finance where safety and transparency matter most. Additionally, the proposed strategies for the bespoke vault are flexible, allowing for adaptability to market conditions and maximizing returns for MakerDAO. Overall, this proposal is a great opportunity for MakerDAO to benefit from Yearn\u2019s expertise and track record in yield generation and risk management.  Ratification Poll for Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults (MIP13c3-SP13) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: Yes Summary: MIP13c3-SP13 proposal is intended to pick a RWA on-chain monitoring solution by electing to fund a proposed SPF by an external solution provider. The proposer should demonstrate the ability and the credentials that they can develop a trustworthy and transparent solution to RWA monitoring. Why we are voting Yes: The proposal aims to develop maximum transparency around the scaling up of RWA vaults for yield and diversification, by picking an external solution provider that can develop a trustworthy and transparent solution for monitoring RWA vaults for violations of covenants or reporting obligations.  Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Chainlink Automation (MIP63c4-SP5) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: Yes Summary: MIP63c4-SP5 proposes adding Chainlink Automation to MakerDAO\u2019s third-party Keeper Network to improve the protocol\u2019s security and uptime guarantees. A Chainlink Automation contract test run has been conducted on the Ethereum mainnet and has completed 35 automation jobs without issue. The budget parameters are the same as other Keeper network participants, and any excess DAI beyond the maximum will be returned to the surplus buffer. Why we are voting Yes: The proposal aims to improve the Maker protocol\u2019s efficiency, security, and decentralization by adding Chainlink Automation to the Keeper Network. The test run of the contract has been successful, and the budget and other parameters are in line with other Keeper network participants. The integration of Chainlink Automation is expected to impact the protocol\u2019s performance at a low cost positively.  Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for developing Proof-of-Performance for Viridian Cluster (MIP55c3-SP13) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: No Summary: This MIP proposes a Special Purpose Fund (SPF) of 500,000 DAI to fund a set of RWA projects to be undertaken by the Viridian Cluster within the 6 months of Jan 2023 - Jun 2023. The projects include MIP65, MIP81, MIP88 and potentially others brought for evaluation to the community, where Monetalis will act as Arranger. The SPF will allow Maker to continue key RWA projects in the interim period until MetaDAOs can be launched and allows the Maker Community to evaluate the work of the Viridian Cluster ahead of a potential adoption of the cluster to a Protector MetaDAO. Why we are voting No: Unclear on future viability. Happy to revisit after the endgame is in a more advanced position.  Ratification Poll for Commercial Risk and Legal Domain Work to Support SF-001 Expanded Mandate Related to RWAs (MIP55c3-SP12) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: Yes Summary: This MIP proposes creating a special purpose fund (SPF) of 209k DAI to support the expanded mandate of SF-001 regarding RWAs. The fund will be used to onboard a structured finance consultant and legal counsel to perform commercial and legal risk analysis on RWAs, monitor and create reporting for existing RWA vaults, and collaborate with the community on the design of the RWA Council. Why we are voting Yes: This SPF is important as it will provide funding for the commercial and legal risk analysis of RWAs, which is crucial for protecting Maker Core and DAI holders as the protocol navigates the End Game Plan.  Ratification Poll for Protocol DAI Transfer to Fund IS-001 from Dec 2022 to May 2023 (MIP14c2-SP2) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: Yes Summary: This MIP proposes a protocol DAI transfer of 43,560 DAI to fund the Immunefi Security Core Unit (ISCU) from December 2022 to May 2023. The ISCU team and services will be sustained through May, and they anticipate dissolving as a Core Unit and becoming an EndGame ecosystem actor. Why we are voting Yes: The proposed transfer is well below the DAI Transfer Ceiling (250,000 DAI) and is taken from the current surplus. The ISCU has been maintaining and providing security services to the MakerDAO ecosystem. The funding will support the team and services to continue the work until May 2023, after which they plan to dissolve as a Core Unit and become an EndGame ecosystem actor.  Ratification Poll for Requesting Protocol DAI Transfer to fund TechOps CU for February 2023 (MIP14c2-SP1) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: Yes Summary: This MIP proposes a transfer of 138,894 DAI to fund TechOps CU for February 2023. The team, critical infrastructure, tools, and services will be sustained through this month, and a second MIP14 sub-proposal will be posted for the month of March. Why we are voting Yes: The community rejected the TechOps CU\u2019s original 2023 budget for several reasons, including being too high and not giving Bear market vote options. They have taken this feedback onboard and have revised their new budget significantly, which will be up for voting in March 2023. Due to the quarterly budgeting cycle, they are left without funding for February and March 2023, which will cover their expenses for February. Any excess funds will be promptly returned to the protocol.  Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding (COM-001) (MIP39c3-SP7) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: 60.7K / 100% | 60.7K / 80% Summary: This MIP is a proposal to offboard the GovComms Core Unit and provide the contributors with a \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation and retroactive benefits. The goal is to support the transition, formalize the team\u2019s status, and provide compensation. The proposal includes a one-time expense of 60,700 DAI to cover the offboarding costs. Why we are voting Yes: This proposal includes a one-time expense of 60,700 DAI to cover the offboarding expenses of the GovComms Core Unit. This amount is necessary to provide a \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation and retroactive benefits to the contributors, which is appropriate as they have been working on the project and their work will be transitioned or closed by the end of December. The 100% multiplier will ensure sufficient funds to cover all necessary expenses. Thank you for everything govcoms. We look forward to working with you again!  Ratification Poll for Remove MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) (MIP4c2-SP32) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: Yes Summary: The MIP4c2-SP32 proposal aims to remove the 250,000 DAI cap on the total amount of DAI that can be distributed through MIP14, known as the Protocol DAI Transfer. The proposal is motivated by the anticipation of an increase in funding requests through MIP14 and MIP55 as the MakerDAO system transitions to the Endgame state. Why we are voting Yes: Removing the cap would prevent a failure state where the sum of all fund requests in a Governance Cycle through MIP14 would exceed the ceiling and would not allow for the distribution of Maker Governance-approved funds promptly. Additionally, the remaining content of MIP14 is considered appropriate, and therefore, there is no need to replace the entire MIP.  Ratification Poll for Obsolete MIP Removal (MIP23, MIP28) (MIP4c4-SP3) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: Yes Summary: The MIP4c4-SP3 proposal aims to remove MIP23 and MIP28, passed in 2020. The motivation for this proposal is that the Domain framework, which these MIPs are a part of, has been superseded by the Core Unit Framework, and the transition from the former to the latter is complete, making these MIPs no longer necessary. Why we are voting Yes: Removing these MIPs would keep MakerDAO\u2019s MIPS Framework slim and reflective of the system\u2019s current state. Additionally, MIP23 and MIP28 are no longer serving any purpose. They are considered obsolete, so it\u2019s beneficial to mark them as such and remove them to maintain the clarity and efficiency of the framework.  Ratification Poll for MIP14 Repeal (MIP4c4-SP2) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: No Summary: This MIP proposes repealing MIP14, which outlines a generic procedure for DAI to be sent from the protocol to an Ethereum address. The MIP is being proposed to simplify the growing body of DAO governance processes and policies. As MIP14 does not appear to have ever been utilized, the transfer of DAI for several purposes has typically been authorized through whatever governance action authorizes the activity financed by that transfer. Why we are voting No: Future ability to fund.  Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (MIP4c2-SP28) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: No Summary: This MIP is proposing an amendment to MIP51 by removing the calendar exception found in MIP51c4. The December exception was put in place when there were significant problems with getting anything done in the Maker on-chain governance. However, with the current delegate system in place, these problems have been resolved, and the December exception is no longer needed to govern the protocol without a break. Why we are voting No: While we understand the spirit of this proposal. We believe that structure around complex governance structures is OK. The December gap allows participants and delegates to reflect on the protocol and work on in-depth topics/problems in preparation for January.  Ratification Poll for Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP29) - January 9, 2023 Forum Discussion Vote: Approve both Summary: This MIP proposes an amendment to MIP61 that aims to change two aspects of the Recognized Delegate Compensation MIP. The first change is that recognized delegates will not be eligible for compensation if they fail to meet a threshold of non-abstaining votes. The second change is that participation in executive votes should have a higher weight and stricter requirements when compared to on-chain polls. Why we are voting Yes: The proposal will improve the accountability and responsibility of Recognized Delegates by setting a threshold for non-abstaining votes and making executive votes more critical. This will ensure that Recognized Delegates actively participate in the governance process and consider the security and operational issues surrounding Executive Votes. ",

The first poll asks if the community supports changing the PSM tout parameter. The fee-out-tout parameter is the percentage fee applied when trading DAI into the PSM in exchange for the collateral asset. The second poll is asking if the debt ceiling parameter should also be changed. Why we are voting to reduce the GUSD tout Lowering the tout will incentive the swapping of DAI for the underlying collateral. This is a natural methodology to lower GUSD risk or be prepared to act further. Why we are voting to reduce to 100 million: Maintaining a similar theme of risk mitigation. Risk is important to manage in unknown times. Although this is a good source of income and is generally trusted by the protocol, lowering the debt ceiling lowers risk in the case of unimaginable scenarios. Additionally, there is a concern that market confidence and reputation/trust deteriorate in Gemini. Although this is FUD right now, this should be looked at seriously. Note. We support Gemini and the general openness of GUSD. We do not have evidence of any failures. However, we believe general risk mitigation is not bad in any scenario. ",

It explains that these vault types no longer serve many purposes in the protocol since the PSM was established and that the liquidity of these vaults will likely increase the reserves. It also notes that the remaining vault positions can be seen as having theoretical value for their owners but that some are abandoned, and liquidation is the only way to remove them from the system. Why we are voting yes: We support the standard operations of the DAO,  it should be noted that sound accounting practices take precedence within the protocol.   Adjusting Dust Parameter Forum Discussion Vote: Yes Summary: The proposal is to reduce the minimum debt required to open a vault in the Maker protocol, known as the \u201cdust parameter.\u201d This would make vaults more accessible for smaller users, but also carries some risk of negative user experience if gas prices increase in the future. Why we are voting for a broad reduction: A broad reduction would allow more users to access vaults and make the protocol more inclusive. This would also increase the potential utility of small vaults, as the cost of using them has decreased. Why we are voting for a limited reduction: A limited reduction would still increase accessibility for smaller users and maintain a buffer against risk in case gas prices increase. This would be a more cautious approach to reducing dust parameters and would balance accessibility with risk management. Both options are to reflect and in line with market conditions. ",

The impact on the surplus buffer is insignificant, and buying the MKR token could indicate a beneficial future return. However, there are potential risks, such as depleting the surplus buffer and the transaction costs of a $100/day burn. The micro-burn is intended to be a permanent feature and managed by the Risk CU. Takeaway: While the proposal to restart the micro-burn of MKR tokens at a rate of $100/day from the surplus buffer may have some benefits, the uncertain economic landscape and impeding change of protocol economics outweigh the benefits. Therefore, waiting for more favorable market conditions and a more clear understanding of protocol economics may be better before implementation.   Executive Dust Parameter Changes, Chainlink Automation Keeper Network Stream Setup, Recognized Delegate Compensation for January - February 8, 2023 Vote: Supported Summary: This is a summary of a proposal placed in the Maker Protocol\u2019s voting system by the Governance Facilitator(s) and the Protocol Engineering Core Unit. It proposes the following changes to the Maker Protocol, which require the support of MKR Holders in the voting system to become active:  Debt floor (dust) reductions for various Vault types, as detailed below. A total of 181,000 DAI to be streamed to the Chainlink Automation Keeper Network. A total of 109,048 DAI to be distributed to 17 Recognized Delegates, as detailed below.  ",

When DAI is transferred to the DAI contract address, it is destroyed, and there is no way to retrieve the lost funds. The proposal recommends that DAI regarded as permanently destroyed be issued to the transferrer through the mint function in the smart contract. Maker could also support users by imposing a 10% penalty to prevent abuse. Takeaway: Accidentally losing funds by transferring DAI to the DAI contract address can be a frustrating and costly experience for users. The proposed MIP addresses this issue by allowing users to recover their lost funds. Furthermore, the proposal includes measures to prevent abuse and ensure the sustainability of the DAI ecosystem. As such, we voted Yes on this proposal. Link: MIP62 to Allow for Changing Communication Responsibilities Forum: Link Vote: Yes Summary: This amendment aims to replace GovComms as the responsible party for communicating offboarding through MIP62 and to prevent the need for a token vote in the future. It modifies MIP62c2 and MIP62c3 and adds a new component, MIP62c5. The amendment replaces references to GovComms with a Communication Coordinator defined in MIP62c5, with GovAlpha as the new coordinator. The amendment also allows MIP Editors to modify MIP62c5 without a governance vote under certain conditions and requires public communication of any modifications. Takeaway: The proposed amendment seeks to enhance the MIP governance process by replacing GovComms with a more flexible Communication Coordinator defined in MIP62c5. It also streamlines the process of modifying MIP62c5 to ensure that the communication role can be fulfilled effectively, even if the previous coordinator is unwilling or unable to do so. Furthermore, the requirement for public communication of any modifications to MIP62c5 increases transparency and accountability in the governance process. Overall, this amendment improves the governance framework and makes it more resilient to future challenges. Link: Ratification Poll for Amend Interim Facilitator Appointment Process Forum: Link Vote: Yes Summary: The existing Interim Facilitator process has been deemed less than ideal, with issues such as lack of speedy resolution and inflexibility. Therefore, changes have been proposed to make the process more effective. The proposed changes include limiting the number of Interim Facilitators to one, specifying the maximum time an Interim Facilitator can serve, and making them responsible for finding a permanent replacement. The appointment process has also been modified to give Governance Facilitators more power to modify the process, to allow voluntary offboarding Facilitators to nominate an Interim Facilitator, and to enable other Core Units to override the outgoing Facilitator if necessary. Several edge cases are also detailed in the MIP to cover likely scenarios, and Governance Facilitators are explicitly empowered to resolve unanticipated edge cases. This change reduces Maker Governance\u2019s input in Interim Facilitator selection in favor of speed and maintaining continuity. Takeaway: The changes reduce Maker Governance\u2019s input in Interim Facilitator selection, which is expected to result in faster resolution times and better continuity. Link: Ratification Poll for $100M of Cogent Bank Loan Participations Forum: Link Vote: Yes Summary: Cogent Bank, an FDIC-regulated bank, has proposed participating in MakerDAO\u2019s existing RWA Master Participation Trust with $100M of loans using the same Participation Agreement with the same terms as MakerDAO\u2019s deal with Huntingdon Valley Bank. The proposal is an opportunity for MakerDAO to reinforce its strategic value for community banks and doubles Cogent\u2019s capacity to originate loans to existing and new customers. Takeaway: The Huntingdon Valley Bank deal\u2019s success helped validate MakerDAO\u2019s approach to RWAs. It attracted the attention of other banks like Cogent Bank, which has proposed to participate with $100M in loans using the same participation agreement and terms as the Huntingdon Valley Bank deal.

The team has outlined the immediate scope of the work, which includes reviewing the Aave v3 fork, and new interest rate mechanics, presenting a technical assessment of the integration partner, considering a resubmission to ChainSecurity, and liaising with Phoenix Labs to create a Governance Executive when ready to launch. Takeaway: This initiative can bring new users and assets to the protocol, increasing its overall value. The work outlined by PECU is crucial to ensuring the successful integration of Aave v3 and Spark Lend. Link: Engineering Resource for Phoenix Labs - February 20, 2023 Forum: Link Vote (not submitted):  Suggested Yes Summary: PECU is seeking approval from Governance to dedicate one full-time engineer to the Phoenix Labs initiative for a limited time, along with funding for February, March, and April. The Spark Protocol MIPs have failed to seek approval from Governance to commence or dedicate technical resources to this initiative before the formal MIP passing, so PECU is requesting approval for transparency and to provide clarity for the work already happening. Takeaway: The proposal has the potential to bring growth and innovation to Maker through the periphery Spark Protocol and Phoenix Labs initiative, and dedicating an engineer for a limited time and providing funding aligns with Maker\u2019s goal to support and encourage new initiatives.

The research conducted will be made available to any team approved by Maker Governance for building decentralized products. Why we voted Yes: The SPF will provide the necessary funding to ensure the legal and incorporation requirements are met for launching the Spark Protocol, a new product for MakerDAO. This will help attract new users and generate a new line of business for Maker, while also supporting the Endgame Plan and future creator subDAOs. Key Takeaway: Supporting innovative projects, such as the Spark Protocol, can help grow the DeFi ecosystem and benefit MakerDAO in the long run. Proper legal and incorporation processes are essential for launching decentralized products, and research conducted in this SPF can benefit other Maker Governance-approved teams in the future.  Link:  Decrease the RETH-A Dust Parameter - March 6, 2023 Forum: Link Vote: Yes Summary: Maker recently adjusted the dust parameters for several large-cap vault types, and now they are proposing to reduce the RETH-A dust parameter from 15,000 DAI to 7,500 DAI. This will align the RETH-A dust parameter with similar vault types and make it more accessible for smaller users. Why we voted Yes: The proposed change will increase usage. It will provide more economic benefits for 7,500 DAI debt RETH-A vaults to repay, instead of allowing their position to liquidate. Additionally, the reduced dust parameter aligns RETH-A with similar vault types, making it more accessible for smaller users. Key Takeaway: Maker is constantly reviewing and adjusting its parameters to ensure the safety and accessibility of its platform. The proposed change to the RETH-A dust parameter is a positive step in this direction, as it will make the platform more accessible to smaller users while still protecting Maker from potential risks.

The proposed actions aim to limit Maker\u2019s exposure to potentially impaired stablecoins and other risky collaterals while maintaining enough liquidity to prevent DAI from trading significantly above $1 if conditions change. Why we voted yes: The proposed changes aim to reduce Maker\u2019s exposure to potential bank failures and limit potential losses. The changes also aim to prevent excessive dumping of USDC into the PSM and limit arbitrage opportunities to drain stronger USDP collateral from the protocol. Key takeaways: The proposed changes aim to reduce debt ceilings for collaterals containing USDC to 0, reduce the gap parameter for PSM-USDC-A from 950 million DAI to 250 million DAI, reduce the gap parameter for PSM-GUSD-A from 50 million to 10 million DAI, increase the maximum debt ceiling line for PSM-USDP-A to 1 billion from 450 million DAI, set the bar to 0 for Compound v2 D3M, and reduce the GSM delay to 16 hours. These changes aim to limit Maker\u2019s exposure to potential bank failures and prevent significant losses. ",

The additional funds would be deployed into a 6-month US Treasury ladder strategy with bi-weekly rollover. Why we are voting YES: Supporting this proposal allows MakerDAO to invest in a low-risk US Treasury ladder strategy, which could provide a stable source of revenue for the DAO. Furthermore, the proposal outlines clear execution and adjustment mechanics and an emergency liquidation plan, ensuring that risks are managed effectively. This aligns with our long-running stance on the conservative use of the PSM. Key Takeaways: The proposal includes detailed information on the legal structure, execution and adjustment mechanics, and emergency liquidation plans. Sygnum Bank will be the Asset Strategy Implementation Partner under the MakerDAO Resolution Instruction outlined.  Link:  Remove the DC-IAM from MIP65 (RWA007-A) Forum: Link Vote: Yes In line with the above.  Link: Vault Setting Amendment Subproposal Forum: Link Vote: No Summary: The vote proposes strategies for deploying PSM USDC in Yearn vaults to generate yield. The strategies include Gen Lender, GUNIV3USDC-DAI, and GenLevComp v3. Each strategy will have a deposit limit of 1,000,000 PSM USDC, resulting in a total of 3,000,000 PSM USDC across all strategies. Why we are voting NO: We believe CUs are working through onboarding, and although we support this idea and the financial risk is low, it is best to wait for official channels to work through.  Link: Return Excess MIP65 Funds to Surplus Buffer - March 13, 2023 Forum: Link Vote: Yes Summary: This poll request to return surplus funds from the MIP65 Clydesdale structure to the Surplus Buffer. The proposal involves selling 8,540 IB01 and 73,486 IBTA based on data from the Excess Return Spreadsheet and transferring the generated funds to the Surplus Buffer. Why we are voting YES: Sending the surplus funds to the Surplus Buffer aligns with the quarterly requirements of MIP65 and contribute to maintaining the overall stability of the MakerDAO ecosystem. This action also helps to ensure the liquidation process functions as intended and encourages further automation in the liquidation process. ",

Was involved with the Tezos community in its early days. Did some UX work for Radar Relay. Served on the Tribe a.k.a. Fei DAO Optimistic Approval multisig committee, which successfully served as a testbed before Tribe\u2019s transition to Orca Pod-based Liquid governance in May '22. During its 8-month run OA reviewed and voted on 130+ actions, including reviewing the input of the security audit vendor to verify the work done before wiring payment. Currently on the Gro protocol Treasury management committee with a mandate to execute on pre-agreed (\u2018whitelisted\u2019) treasury deployments, run due diligence and negotiations, submit proposals to the DAO for voting, and instruct the DAO multisig to act on those instructions. The Platform Bringing in background in machine learning, TradFi financial consulting and some DeFi I recognise as equally important for Maker\u2019s foreseeable future nurturing DAO culture conducive to building trust of current and potential Maker products users while integrating into the DAO practice   web3-native intelligence for protocol stewardship, collateral onboarding and Treasury management;   provably optimal infrastructure funding mechanisms;   web3-native community support tools   thus fulfilling the protocol\u2019s mission as a provider of decentralised financial products.  Ironically Maker, as DeFi at large, turns out to be in the trust business. It\u2019s just that trust here concerns DAO\u2019s technical and organisational reliability, a stablecoin being a trust-driven financial vehicle. You use DAI as a store of value, a medium of exchange because you\u2019re confident about the technical and cultural sustainability of MakerDAO, its ability to build and maintain stability of its products. Realistically retail users don\u2019t read Github or Discourse \u2014 they just have a certain subjective attitude towards the organisation, its products and its prospects. As shown by a16z cofounder Ben Horowitz in his books  \u201cWhat you do is who you are\u201d, and \u201cThe hard thing about hard things\u201d organisation\u2019s culture codified in its leaders\u2019 actions is a crucial ingredient in the whole endeavour\u2019s success or failure. For example, there\u2019s a direct link between a leader\u2019s arrogance and negligence on the ground level. People learn what\u2019s considered admissible in the organisation from a leader\u2019s behaviour patterns. Thus, a leader\u2019s hubris can well translate into subpar software quality or security breaches. Delegates, as MKR holder\u2019s agents, serve here as a mechanism of checks and balances preventing such a course of actions. As a brief reference here is a brief interview of Ben Horowitz discussing ways of handling culture and crisis at places like Facebook, WeWork and Boeing (the B737 MAX crisis):       With DeFi gradually coming of age MakerDAO must learn to build and maintain user trust in Maker\u2019s products beyond the enthusiast user base. As the industry is deeply entangled, DAO members should have a clear and profound understanding of DeFi dynamics at large. At the moment there\u2019s little understanding in the industry about under-the-hood economics of even major platforms, let alone emerging ones (which comprise the majority). Basically when we say that e.g. Aave is mature we imply that judging from its track record we can assume that it\u2019s highly stable. The subprime mortgage crisis of '08 once again reminded everybody that there is no such thing as stable by default and too mature to fail \u2014 thanks to miscalculated risks of structured products on the balance Lehman Brothers, a major Wall St. bank with a 170-year history, went bust. And AIG survived only thanks to the Fed bailout worth $200B (the scale of risk miscalculation!). The whole entangled industry was on the verge of collapse. Without web3-native, not translated from TradFi, tools for insight there\u2019s a good chance that we\u2019re heading towards a crisis of (relatively) similar scale in DeFi caused by underestimated or miscalculated risks. Meanwhile, DeFi doesn\u2019t have the Fed to bail it out. Maker as any web3 protocol is an evolving shared narrative: it lives simultaneously in two domains open for exploration: onchain transactions and broader user&contributor community interactions. They inform and impact each other in both directions in a myriad of ways creating a bipartite heterogenous living organism. To comprehend and be able to predict this organism means to be able to model and predict evolution of its two integral parts in a coherent, unified way. My thoughts and proposals on this:     Towards web3-native intelligence: tools for protocol comprehension and stewardship Proposal Ideas       I\u2019m working on web3/DeFi-native modelling and am seeking funding + colab opportunities for the next stage. Wanted to gauge community mood regarding match of interests before submitting formal applications.   TL;DR A web3 protocol is an evolving shared narrative: it lives simultaneously in two domains open for exploration, onchain transactions and community interactions. They inform and impact each other in both directions in a myriad of ways creating a bipartite heterogenous living organism. To \u2026      To prove its organisation\u2019s trustworthy sustainability, MakerDAO must learn to fund its infrastructure development and maintenance initiatives in the most efficient, optimal way. The key task that is up for recurrent solutions within MakerDAO is finding consensus over alternative policy priorities and allocating limited resources (financial and non-financial) accordingly. In other words bridging the discrepancy in perceived subjective value of respective competing policy venues, ideally by measuring it and mapping these subjective values to respective allocations in an optimal Maker\u2019s interests-wise way. One can foresee that without a systematic approach this problem will only exacerbate with the protocol growing more complex with consequent increasing complexity of the protocol\u2019s infrastructure and range of contributing efforts. Since Maker, as any decentralised fat protocol, is open infrastructure, Maker infrastructure funding is essentially a problem of optimal allocation of limited resources towards public goods. There is a provably optimal way to do it. My thoughts and proposals on this:     DeCap + Quadratic Funding: augmenting the EndGame. Optimal infrastructure funding mechanism for MakerDAO Governance       I\u2019ve been thinking about @rune 's Endgame proposal.  The key task that is up for recurrent solutions within MakerDAO is finding consensus over alternative policy priorities and allocating limited resources (financial and non-financial) accordingly. In other words bridging the discrepancy in perceived subjective value of respective competing policy venues, ideally by measuring it and mapping these subjective values to respective allocations in an optimal Maker\u2019s interests-wise way. One can forese\u2026      Discord and Discourse were not devised with web3 use cases in mind and hence limit the DAO. This community could again be a trailblazer for the industry in adopting web3-native community support platforms. Geneva integrates token-gated rooms and wallet connect on top of chat rooms, forum rooms, audio rooms, video rooms, and broadcast rooms in one platform with all standard features. They promise in the near future more web3-native stuff around tokenomics-based data feeds enabling turning networks into economies. Skiff: IPFS-based Docs + Drive + Mail with wallet connect.  As a long-term topic I\u2019d encourage discussing that given escalating USD inflation maybe it\u2019d be wise for Maker to work on stable products pegged to something different than 1 fiat currency, e.g. a basket of commodities. A similar TradFi experiment with IMF Special Drawing Rights has already happened. It might actually become Maker\u2019s competitive edge.

You can\u2019t avoid finding a compromise between unfair and unrealistic KPIs, which always don\u2019t take into account the reality of life, and subjective, opinionated human decisions. Inevitably there needs to be a layer between MKR holders and CUs for oversight and stewardship. Direct democracy works only under a very rigid scaffold of conditions. For now delegates have no codified power for oversight, but somebody has to do it in the interests of MKR holders. Maker could go forward with designing and implementing a bespoke structure(s) with this mandate. Unfortunately, the protocol is losing money as we are debating the issue. The proposal is an opportunity to sculpture such structure on the go. It will be an emergent rather than planned process. There\u2019s nobody in the Maker community other than delegates who could jumpstart this process of finding an optimal design for the oversight and stewardship body by working on a better budgeting process simultaneously tackling the problem of bringing the protocol to the break even point. Hence support of tactical reallocation. ",

This is essential for a DAO and also creates more space in our \u201ccomplexity budget\u201d to onboard high value features.   Developing sustainable, decentralized systems. I fully support reaching an end game where the protocol can run itself with simple oversight.   Ensure the interest Maker holders are represented. I welcome communication with all holders.   Delegate Statement As a delegate working under Wallfacer Labs, my goal is to turn Maker into a trillion-dollar entity that is easy to understand and decentralized. I am committed to helping grow Maker into a sustainable, profitable system that provides DAI as an accessible, permissionless stablecoin. To do this, I will emphasize reducing complexity and building easy to evaluate processes, to ensure that both delegates and Maker holders can understand the protocol and it\u2019s governance. Simplicity is essential to decentralization, both to avoid hidden centralization points and to identify potential weaknesses and waste. I am a believer in incremental improvement, so I am just as interested in little ideas to make things run more smoothly as big sweeping changes. I will support proposals that provide strong risk-adjusted returns, with clear metrics to evaluate their success. I will object to proposals with unjustifiably high costs or that don\u2019t fit into the wider Maker ecosystem and it\u2019s budget. As a delegate, I commit to providing honesty, transparency and openness to both Maker holders and the community. About Wallfacer Wallfacer Labs is a crypto research and development company. We build and govern crypto protocols. Wallfacer employs a range of smart contract development and governance experts, allowing us to make informed decisions on all aspects of the protocol. Disclosures I have positions in Eth, MKR and TRU, and work under Wallfacer Labs. I will abstain on votes where a conflict of interest may occur. Waiver of Liability By delegating to me, you acknowledge and agree that I participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to my participation in the Maker Protocol or MakerDAO.

While this will be a large undertaking, it is necessary to have quality easy to access data on the different parts of MakerDao. Opposing Pando greenlight- While I would like to onboard green assets, the long duration and low-liquidity is a deal break for me. I firmly believe that the quality of deals we are getting will rapidly improve, both from arrangers getting more comfortable with us and us learning how to make better deals. Therefore, it is essential that we remain flexible and don\u2019t get tied down supporting legacy deals. Support Maker Teleport- L2s are the future and essential to onboarding retail. Support Open Market Committee Proposal-The reasoning behind these changes is sound. Should increase dai minting and earn fees on LPs. ",

Ratification Poll for MIP50 Direct Deposit Module Amendment (MIP4c2-SP23) (thread) Support- Expanding the scope of MIP50 as requested is reasonable.

Given the newness of the CU, it makes sense to at least let them finish out their budget cycle.  Community Greenlight Poll - Cabot (Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining LLC) (thread) Oppose- The deal is highly illiquid, risky in the event of a Bitcoin crash and jurisdictionally complex. In addition to the value of the collateral plummeting in the event of a crash, the expense of taking possession of and liquidating a large collection of ASICs located in Paraguay would result in a large loss. The greenness of Bitcoin mining with hydropower is also dubious. ",

Community Greenlight Poll - GNO (GnosisDAO) - September 5, 2022  Voted No. Per the proposal liquidity and order book depth on this token is around 1 million. This means the limit on what MakerDAO can safely onboard is also fairly low. If my analysis is correct, the 30M Dai proposed would be impossible to liquidate. Community Greenlight Poll - GAMMA UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC (Gamma Uniswap v3 wBTC-renBTC) - September 5, 2022  Voted no. Similar reasons around limited ability to safely onboard at scale, along with lack of clarity on the actual product being onboarded.  Community Greenlight Poll - GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI (Gelato Uniswap v3 BUSD-DAI) - September 5, 2022  Voted no. Also has very low volume and is unlikely to scale. Ratification Poll for Amend Measurement Period For Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP24) - September 12, 2022  Voted Yes. A limited period is a good idea. The current system is far too harsh on people who were inactive in the past. Ratification Poll for MKR Compensation for StarkNet Engineering Core Unit, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP79) - September 12, 2022  Voted No. Any plans for bonuses or retroactive compensation should be discussed upfront. Delegates are ultimately spending other people\u2019s money, so we need to stick to agreements unless there is a strong reason to deviate. Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for The Ambassador Program (MIP55c3-SP7) - September 12, 2022  Voted Yes. Small bets like this can have big payoffs and the LATAM community has a lot of potential for MakerDAO. Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Offboarding (MIP39c3-SP2) - September 12, 2022  Voted Yes. My reasons are covered extensively in the proposal forum post. ",

Change PSM-GUSD-A Parameters  Voted Yes. It is a good idea to boost GUSD uptake in light of Gemini\u2019s recent proposal.  End DAI Funding For Sourcecred  Voted Yes. While I like the idea behind Sourecred, the forum has seen a significant uptick in low effort comments and Sourcecred generally erodes trust in community member posts.  MOMC Guidance - Remove ETH Supply Yield And Liquidity Incentives From D3M Target Borrow Rate Calculations and MOMC Guidance - Allowed Spread Between D3M Target Borrow Rate And ETH-A Stability Fee  Voted Yes and voted to set a 0.5% spread. This should boost Aave D3M boost. Good to see approval voting in use.  Ratification Poll for Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set   Voted Yes. While I have concerns over the POVE, metadaos have a lot of potential and I am excited to see them implemented. I also agree that the current system of introducing collateral is broken and these reforms are an improvement. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Strategic Happiness Core Unit - SH-001 (MIP39c3-SP3) - October 10, 2022  Voted Yes. As mentioned elsewhere, the CU has had a number of accounting and cost management issues. It is also unnecessary as a core part of Makerdao in light of the endgame plan. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Events Core Unit - EVENTS-001 (MIP39c3-SP4) - October 10, 2022  Voted Yes. This CU is unnecessary in light of the endgame plan. CUs should be more focused on core essential functions of Makerdao. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Real-World Finance Core Unit - RWF-001 (MIP39c3-SP5) - October 10, 2022  Voted Yes. This CU imploded months ago and it is unfortunate it took so long to offboard. This shows flaws in our current offboarding system. Ratification Poll for Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP81) - October 10, 2022  Voted Yes. Coinbase is a solid partner and a good way to earn a small yield in a highly liquid way. Ratification Poll for Monetalis-Coinbase Appaloosa (MIP82) - October 10, 2022  Voted Yes. Coinbase is a solid partner and this proposal is a good way to earn a moderate yield on our assets. Ratification Poll for Legal And Commercial Risk Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral BlockTower Credit - RWA Arranger SPF (MIP55c3-SP9) - October 10, 2022  Voted Yes. Happy to see this proposal moving along and I support the legal work to onboard it. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding Process (MIP41c5) adjustments (MIP4c2-SP26) - October 10, 2022  Voted yes for the reasons I described in the proposal. Special thanks to GovAlpha for highlighting problems with the current wording of MIP41c5 and suggestions on how to fix them. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding - RWF-001 (MIP41c5-SP12) - October 10, 2022  Voted Yes. This CU imploded months ago and it is unfortunate it took so long to offboard. This shows flaws in our current offboarding system. ",

Add Multiple BlockTower Credit Vault Types (RWA010, RWA011, RWA012, RWA013) - November 21, 2022  Voted no. MakerDAO currently does not have a CU tasked with monitoring RWAs.

Proceed with Pre-Implementation Work for the Deal Outlined in MIP90 (BlockTower Liquid AAA Structured Credit and Money Market Fund) - November 21, 2022  Voted no. Strategic Finance is already spread fairly thin, particularly with CES offboarding. I would prefer to put a pause on private market credit and stick to onboarding more US treasuries while MakerDAO develops proper risk monitoring tools. ",

Executives are also vital to the protocol and currently under-weighted in participation metrics. Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (MIP4c2-SP28) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Voting is already fairly slow and this exception can slow it further. A proposal put forward on October 8th currently can\u2019t be approved until January 23rd.

Increase the MIP65 (RWA007-A) Debt Ceiling - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: No There has not yet been an adequate explanation for the discrepancies in expenses, both in why Monetalis charged when they did and in why the trustee authorized it.

Ratification Poll for Phoenix Labs - Spark Lend Launch (SPF) (MIP55c3-SP16) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes I am excited to see MakerDAO building something on chain, and I look forward to seeing how Spark Lend turns out. It has a talented team behind it that is passionate about the project. Ratification Poll for D3M to Spark Lend (MIP116) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: No While I support Spark Lend, I believe the initial D3M of 100 million is too high. Spark should start with a much lower cap and have it increased as the project becomes battle-tested. As a side note, I dislike the trend of proposing 9 figures up-front on new products, particularly when there isn\u2019t an option for a lower figure. Ratification Poll for Expand Facilitator Definition to Allow Entities (MIP4c2-SP34) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes The additional legal protection of an entity for facilitators is a good idea. Ratification Poll for Risk Facilitator Onboarding (RISK-001) (MIP41c4-SP41) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes See Above. Ratification Poll for Protocol Engineering Facilitator Onboarding (MIP41c4-SP42) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes See Above. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget (DECO-001) (MIP40c3-SP89) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Resources can be better allocated elsewhere. DECO was on-boarded in 2021 to bring fixed rate vaults to MakerDAO, claiming to have done much of the work already. They have so far spent over 2 million with nothing active in the protocol. It is also uncertain if this product will even be used if fixed rate vaults move towards subDAOs. Ratification Poll for Starknet CU Budget Extension (SNE-001) (MIP14c2-SP4) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes L2 is set to be the future of Ethereum and it is essential for DAI to provide secure, low friction options for users. Ratification Poll for Requesting Protocol DAI Transfer to fund TechOps CU for March 2023 (MIP14c2-SP5) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes TechOps provides an important service maintaining the DAO\u2019s infrastructure, so I support their funding. Ratification Poll for Modifying Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit Mandate - SAS-001 (MIP39c2-SP39) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Budget Ratification Poll for TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget (MIP40c3-SP88) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve NewBear budget - 1,368,924 DAI 2nd choice: Reject budget TechOps provides an important service maintaining the DAO\u2019s infrastructure, so I support their budget. Current market conditions favor a leaner CU, so I voted NewBear. Budget Ratification Poll for GovAlpha Core Unit DAI Budget 2023-2024 (MIP40c3-SP90) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve BasePlus budget - 904,805 DAI 2nd choice: Approve Base budget - 805,805 DAI 3rd choice: Approve SuperBear budget - 674,905 DAI GovAlpha is seeing a significant expansion in their workload with the offboarding of GovComms and significant governance restructuring.  Additionally, the budget raise represents significantly less than GovComms was being paid. Budget Ratification Poll for GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget Q2 2023 (MIP40c3-SP91) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: No This is not targeted at GovAlpha. MKR-based compensation has been a persistent pain point for the DAO. It adds complexity to budgeting and has caused a number of issues around offboardings and vestings. As such, I will be voting against all such requests and encourages CUs to move to purely DAI based comp unless a simpler standardized MKR comp solution is developed. Ratification Poll for Modify Risk Core Unit Budget (RISK-001) (MIP40c3-SP92) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve reduced budget - 2,484,000 DAI RISK provides a critical function to the DAO. Current market conditions favor a leaner CU, so I voted for the reduced budget. Budget Ratification Poll for Modifying Strategic Finance Core Unit Budget, SF-001 (MIP40c3-SP93) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve Base budget - 2,409,015 DAI 2nd choice: Approve Bear budget - 1,981,140 DAI Strategic Finance provides a critical function to the DAO and I expect a significant expansion of their workload with other CUs being offboarded, regulatory uncertainty increasing and new projects being brought on. As such, I approved their base budget. Ratification Poll for Modify Data Insights Core Unit Budget (DIN-001) (MIP40c3-SP96) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve reduced budget - 972,000.90 DAI 2nd choice: Approve existing budget - 1,080,001 DAI 3rd choice: Reject budget Data Insights provides a valuable service to the DAO.   Current market conditions favor a leaner CU, so I voted for the reduced budget. Budget Ratification Poll for Modifying Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit Budget (SAS-001) (MIP40c3-SP95) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Reject budget The tools have not seen significant usage and given current market conditions, I do not believe this is a good use of DAO resources. PSM Parameter Normalization - March 20, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Option 2 - Maintain USDC as the Primary Reserve 2nd choice: Option 1 - Diversify Stablecoin Reserves USDC is the only stablecoin MakerDAO supports with significant liquidity, which is essential for maintaining peg stability. Short Ratification Poll for RWA Foundation Broker Onboarding & Expensing for Professional Services (MIP58c4-SP1) - March 20, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Diversifying brokers is reasonable. ",

From that perspective, we believe crypto assets are not a great option in the short term when both markets are very much connected, but can be a very viable option in the long-term when the market will be substantial enough that some of the assets (ETH or BTC) will become much less volatile. RWA is a very stable option that is aligned with the overall Maker vision and brings both diversification and utility to DAI. However, this is one of the most complex options from a legal perspective, and we need to be mindful of that and reflect it on the timeline. D3M is a great opportunity for growth and to bring more utility and resiliency to DAI long term. It has proved to be working well on AAVE and we should continue expanding on this success. In the short-term we recommend using Traditional Financial Instruments and Peg Stability Solutions, due to their stability and ease of use. https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmdZezCr#vote-breakdown Executive Proposal  MKR Vesting Transfers - June 22, 2022 In support of this proposal with no additional comments https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-mkr-vesting-transfers-june-22-2022#proposal-detail ",

This deal can create a great business opportunity for the banking industry, and subsequently for MakerDAO as a liquidity and infrastructure provider. Also, HVBank seems like an ideal partner in terms of the type of products they are going to offer (institutional loans) and also their size and track record. We are slightly concerned about potential delays due to budget cuts, reprioritizations, or re-structuralization efforts. We believe that this deal might be time-sensitive and would be great if the team can progress as planned. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - July 4, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Voted Yes - as the market conditions require these changes, with a disclaimer that we would like to see some effort to get AAVE D3M up and running again, with a limited non-zero loan target.

I will be leading communications and clarify when I am speaking under my very personal capacity rather than as a member of Llama\u2019s delegation. I have been a long-standing supporter of Llama\u2019s vision, and a believer of the DAO-to-DAO model. Llama has been leading the way in the creation of a community that can support multiple DAOs with an evidence-based / project approach, and I am excited to join the team. In joining a DAO-led delegation program it is my intention to depersonalise my contribution to Maker, and grow leaders in the community that will soon take over the role of Delegation Captain. I will let @Puncar and the rest of the team comment on this, and @GovAlpha-Core-Unit update necessary roles and permissions. Thank you, Luca ",

And that can mean that we might shuffle the budgets around, not just cut everywhere. Also, we need to make sure that we are keeping our operation safe and that we have some level of protection. And that\u2019s what the DAI foundation is providing, therefore we are strongly against the Super Bear scenario but pretty comfortable with base and bear. We chose base to support the CU plan to bring 2 other board members to strengthen the foundation, and also we don\u2019t like that bear scenario cuts on the education budget. Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments (MIP4c2-SP15) - August 8, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We always support simplification and process improvements, at this point CU offboarding and budget cuts are discussed a lot and there are different answers to that. Endgame plan, Hasu\u2019s committee approach, Project-based planning, etc. We cannot execute all of them as there is a big overlap, but we can take the best of each to create the best path forward. Till then improvements of current processes as this proposal suggesting is the right path forward. Ratification Poll for Modify Oracle Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP75) - August 8, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve existing budget (Business as usual) Reasoning: Risk management and overall security should always be our top priority as we are a critical piece of DeFi infrastructure and many depend on us. We appreciate the proactivity of the Oracle CU in cutting the budget on their own before someone cut it for them. Still, I would say that it\u2019s not the perfect solution to do it only if the DAO promise not to consider their budget in the future. It\u2019s hard to create certainty when the market is so uncertain. Therefore we vote for the current budget and would like to see how they can bring value to the DAO. For example, if the budget stays as-is - could you move forward with your Oracle as a service product and bring revenue, therefore cutting the budget needed from the DAO even more than 10%? Ratification Poll for MIP50 Direct Deposit Module Amendment (MIP4c2-SP23) - August 8, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Making the D3M more generic and enable not just lending protocols / AAVE to interact with it is the right step forward to support the overall adoption of DAI. Ratification Poll for Makershire Redux (MIP76) - August 8, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Based on the discussion on the forum, we are convinced that this initiative supports the adoption of the DAO while also generating some yield for the DAO. There were some risks pointed out, but based on the analyses from @monet-supply  we believe those risks are manageable, and the potential value created is higher. Ratification Poll for Offboarding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - August 8, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: To support the adoption of DAI, we need to have some marketing word of mouth is super powerful but it doesn\u2019t happen without little support. Events are the places where people gain a conviction, and they spread it to their communities. We agree that we should be mindful of where and how much we are spending, and that\u2019s where this core unit proved its value; they have been able to adjust the budget, find other sponsors and execute great events in the past. Organizing events is not an easy task, and so far all the events went great. Overall we need to work in the budget/market conditions we are in, but we should also think long-term, and get DAI more adoption! ",

However, as things stand today, Maker has neither a clear mandate about what to do with RWAs nor the team to execute it. We should support this application in order to give it priority vs other lower quality applications, but WAIT for mandate and team for implementation. Community Greenlight Poll - Cabot (Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining LLC) - August 15, 2022 (thread) Voted: No (Defer) Reasoning: RWA and incubating LTS have provided their detailed view on the proposal, suggesting NOT to greenlight the application. We feel comfortable following their recommendation. Community Greenlight Poll - DDC (Detox Digital Coin) - August 15, 2022 (thread) Voted: No (Defer) Reasoning: Differently from the BlockTower application, we do not consider this proposal a priority, given the completely new asset class and unknown counterparty. Also considering the difficulties the RWF program is in, we don\u2019t think we should greenlight this proposal. Target Spend Level - August 22, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: No change Reasoning: Difficult to decide in isolation, plus a lot of risk of anchoring, plus very difficult to implement it. We should push for a revised evaluation matrix to understand the Economic Value Added of each CU and then resize budgeting accordingly. We remain convinced that expenses can be redistributed and lowered efficiently without anchoring to a specific total budget. Collateral Onboarding Project-based Funding Request (PFR) - August 22, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Although it is sub-optimal that business as usual has to be managed as such, We believe business continuity has priority. CES\u2019 budget is already huge, but if they use part of the existing one to complete something the community has already voted on, we are supportive.

For this reason, we are voting for Option 2. Ratification Poll for Legal Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral (bIBTA) Special Purpose Fund (MIP55c3-SP6) - August 29, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: There is confusion here circa the mandate of SF vs other CU in analyzing the collateral. It is our understanding that the legal review work should be completed by one of either RWF or CES. We also understand that, in the current confusion of things, RWF has been silently and implicitly handing over responsibilities to other CUs, and that SF is moved by a genuine intention to move things forward. However, we think CU mandates are very important - we decided to abstain given the mix of good intentions and corporate governance misalignments.

In addition, we believe that the amendments go in the direction of the business decisions the groups have had. We are supportive of this proposal. MKR Pro-Rata Vesting for former RWF-001 Members - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We strongly believe that contributors should be compensated for the hard work - and we think that RWF-001 members did provide solid work and tangible results. Although they have not reached their cliff, they have done so due to the unilateral offboarding of RWF-001 facilitator. In TradWorld, typically, staff made redundant can benefit from its earned but yet not vested deferred comp, unless the redundancy has happened due to gross negligence. If gross negligence happened, as RWF-001\u2019s Facilitator seems to indicate through unilateral and disordered posting of private communications, we think an audition of the two parties should be offered and we, as delegates, would like to participate Short Ratification Poll for MIP65 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP4) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: Connected to MIP55c3-SP8, we worry that an emergency amendment needs to be done given that RWF-001 is refusing to respect its mandate while still funded by the DAO. However, although an amendment is needed, we find this amendment way too broad and a potential attack vector, given the amounts under discussion. We would like to see other mitigating factors included in the rewording, e.g. i) narrowing the scope of the Facilitators ability to countersign (e.g. from Risk, Oracle, SES, or CES), ii) requiring an official opinion provided by external counseling, iii) clarifying requirements of the 'community member with legal credentials. We believe that voting YES to this proposal could be an extremely dangerous development of MIP65. Short Ratification Poll for Legal Work on MIP65 Special Purpose Fund (MIP55c3-SP8) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We vote in support of reimbursement for the work done, understanding the spirit of SF-001 to \u2018get things done\u2019 in a period of vacuum. However, and we want to reinstate this clearly, it is disappointing and worrying that RWF-001 hasn\u2019t instead proceeded in providing financial support to one of its CU contractors to proceed with the job - given that it resides firmly in RWF-001 mandate. I believe it is time for the DAO to question not only the existence of RWF-001, but the merit on which the money was already spent - or not spent. ",

But overall, we are supportive of the improvement to the recognized delegates program, and we think it\u2019s essential to make changes based on the learning we got from running the program for more than a year. In terms of this particular proposal, we are supportive of this change as this makes the metrics more up-to-date and also increases the motivation of Delegates to participate. Ratification Poll for the MakerDAO Delegates MIP Set - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: As delegates, we want to be mindful of any potential conflict of interest, and if any MKR holder that delegated to us is not comfortable with this decision, please let us know. But overall, we are supportive of the improvement to the recognized delegates program, and we think it\u2019s essential to make changes based on the learning we got from running the program for more than a year. In terms of this particular proposal, this change can enable more professional organizations to get involved in governance and help MakerDAO with their progress. It also incentivized the Delegates to think long-term about Maker Protocol, thanks to the MKR staking Ratification Poll for MKR Compensation for StarkNet Engineering Core Unit, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP79) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Retroactive funding is the best way of recognizing and rewarding value. We are not investing, we are just buying, but this also increases the cost of such as purchase as there is no risk factor involved anymore. We think the combination of regular salary and bonuses based on value delivered can be an exciting concept, but how do we prove the value, and how do we compare the value of engineering deliverable vs. business process type of deliverable? That won\u2019t be an easy task. However, we would like to explore this way of doing things; MakerDAO is a very mature protocol. Therefore they should not take that much risk but rather let CU invest their time, and if they deliver something valuable, then MakerDAO pays a premium for it. Regarding Starknet CU, we like the approach and need the best talent possible to have our L2 strategy safe. Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for The Ambassador Program (MIP55c3-SP7) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We fully support this initiative of expanding the outreach to non-English speaking countries, and we hope this will subsequently have a great impact on DAI addoption. Ratification Poll for Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP80) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: 150% multiplier (247.70 total MKR) Reasoning: GovAlpha is doing a great job, and they definitely deserve the MKR bonus, but we also need to be mindful that every CU should focus on reducing the budget, therefore we are voting for the 150% multiplier. Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Offboarding (MIP39c3-SP2) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We have been following the discussion, and we are supportive of this proposal as it feels like a mutual agreement between CU and the Maker community.

Therefore we vote for. Change PSM-GUSD-A Parameters - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: Overall we are in support of the new revenue-generating ideas, our concern is that Risk management doesn\u2019t seem to be part of the calculation. We would like to see the calculation of real yield (new yield - increased risk). There are nicely described pros and cons, but it\u2019s hard to quantify if those pros outweigh the cons. End DAI Funding For Sourcecred - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We trust the GovAlpha team analyses that sourcecred program does not bring net-possitive effect to the DAO. We believe the experiment itself was well executed and we should document all our learning to launch an even better program on improving governance participation and overall ideation and discussion. MOMC Guidance - Remove ETH Supply Yield And Liquidity Incentives From D3M Target Borrow Rate Calculations - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: We are abstaining from this vote as there is no clear what type of calculation is bringing more accurate results.

MOMC Guidance - Allowed Spread Between D3M Target Borrow Rate And ETH-A Stability Fee October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted:  Abstain Reasoning: As mentioned in response to the previous proposal, we want to support DAI expansion and more cooperation, but it\u2019s not clear that this is the right path.

We are strongly against voting unrelated and deeply impacting proposals in such manner and are therefore voting NO. We are not in disagreement with some of those proposals, but we are in disagreement with others, and we would like to see the impact of each proposal being narrowed in scope and tackled one by one. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Strategic Happiness Core Unit - SH-001 (MIP39c3-SP3) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We support this proposal as it is based on mutual agreement. And @aburban90 is comfortable with this decision. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Events Core Unit - EVENTS-001 (MIP39c3-SP4) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: Marketing, including events, is important to increase the adoption of the DAI. But as we are in the bear market, we should be mindful of the expenses, and we believe that the events team has been able to do that at previous events, where they have found co-sponsors. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Real-World Finance Core Unit - RWF-001 (MIP39c3-SP5) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: RWF CU needs to be replaced by another team that can onboard RWA collateral, it might be worth having this team on a project basis rather than as a core unit. Ratification Poll for Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP81) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Based on our research we believe Coinbase has one of the safest custody solutions. Therefore we believe that the USDC will be safe. On the other hand, 1.6B of USDC to be taken to less liquid custody is not ideal. We support this proposal, but we (MakerDAO) should monitor the liquidity need based on market conditions and reduce the exposure if needed or even start with the lower amount to test the solution for a couple of months. Ratification Poll for Monetalis-Coinbase Appaloosa (MIP82) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: We would start deploying PSM with one proposal at a time, rather than all at once. Among those proposals, the Coinbase MIP appears superior to us. In addition, we have concerned with Monetalis as a counterparty, given their deep connections with the largest MKR holder (and de facto relative majority in all those proposals) Ratification Poll for Legal And Commercial Risk Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral BlockTower Credit - RWA Arranger SPF (MIP55c3-SP9) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We support project-based funding with clear outcomes and benefits to MakerDAO. The legal review needs to be done, and we think it\u2019s scoped correctly. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding Process (MIP41c5) adjustments (MIP4c2-SP26) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Less friction is needed if we want to operate efficiently as an organization. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding - RWF-001 (MIP41c5-SP12) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: As we stated several times before, this had to happen, and we need to find an alternative for the RWF team to onboard new collateral.

The GovComms CU has a mandate to improve information accessibility and coordination at Maker. We believe there will be valuable ways for us to contribute on those fronts with the upcoming Scopes, DVCs, Frameworks, Tribunals, Councils, MetaDAOs, and more.  It is our view that a move to ecosystem actor may be the best course\u2026     ",

                    "content": "Thanks Juan, you might be right. I\u2019ll share my sense of things.  Calendars have a high likelihood of being picked up by GovAlpha(GOV). Call Support will fall on the shoulders of GOV (and maybe SES?) and may be degraded for the beginning of 2023. No more call summaries for public calls & one less competent host. Forum will have two fewer moderators to fix and tidy things up, though I think it could handle it. Govalpha have been the primary mods, while we mostly fix tags and categorizations. Reddit will likely lose a moderator (50% chance they move to being compensated by GOV) Emergency Comms support won\u2019t suffer much\u2013a lot of the documentation is 85% done and probably makes more sense to be handled within GOV anyway. Stakeholder alignment will likely end in its current state, though I think a good template for how it could be done was set. Others can run similar calls if they feel it\u2019s needed. Collateral Management is changing so I don\u2019t think the CM call is going to carry on in its current form (TBD) and same goes for Security as IS-001 has a high likelihood of being offboarded and generally speaking it\u2019s just been GOV/COM/TECH/IS at those meetings. The SEC milestones we set are valuable and I hope GOV won\u2019t let them get dropped. Stakeholder Content; Weekly Relay, Forum at a Glance, and the Aggregated CU Updates thread likely won\u2019t get picked up right away, if at all. I don\u2019t know what the future of stakeholder content would look like. Stakeholder Database will stop being updated, though we intended to give it over to SES to integrate it into the Ecosystem Dashboard they are developing. Afterall we did the legwork for the GDPR compliance and have a good foundation of data. Stakeholder Notices; I imagine have a high likelihood of being picked up by GOV. Trackers; Some may be picked up, others will become obsolete. I imagine if anyone picks them up it would be GOV. Additionally, for current events tracking, we started doing short research papers to sum things up as a point of reference. That work would likely stop.  ",

                    "content": "Thank you @Pete, In its current form, the PSM reminds us closely a proprietary treasury book of banks, that are free to invest it in low-risk yet yielding securities. Although originated through a different mechanism (providing a stabilisation mechanism to arb-out the positive spread between $DAI and the US dollar, rather than customer deposits) the PSM represents de facto the portion of liquidity that the protocol believes idle and in excess in the system, and that it partially intends to deploy to get proprietary yield without jeopardising balance sheet liquidity. We can argue at length about the i) opportunity to circle back on-chain liquidity through off-chain structure for Maker, or ii) ability and incentive-compatibility of Maker to negotiate and initiate credit lines in the 100s of MM, etc. \u2013 but what is extremely clear to us is that any yield-generating strategy within the PSM should be as close as possible (if not absolutely equal) to the underlying credit and liquidity risk of the asset arb\u2019ed. This means that any investment that differs materially from Circle\u2019s own treasury strategy (for what concerns the $USDC endowment) should be absolutely ruled out. It is our understanding that $OUSD intends to provide yield by exposing Maker to specific protocol risk and benefits of the DeFi protocols it interacts with \u2013 beyond those specific to Origin. We have no intention to discuss the materiality of those risks, nor the execution quality, we want to flag that those risks are very different from those underpinning the stables part of the PSM, and therefore should not be considered as a suitable deployment venue. cc\u2019ing @Llama ",

Thanks for chiming in Luca. We understand that there are a different set of risks with MIP87 than with other proposals and tried to address these risks on the MIP, in the MIP comments, and in the OUSD docs. Unfortunately the Risk CU would not meet with us, which is disappointing, as we could have used the input and suggestions of the CU to strengthen the proposal prior to formal MIP submission. ",

YES- We believe that Rocket Pool\u2019s staking services are on par with that of Lido\u2019s. Despite current market conditions, we expect rETH to meet the initial, wanted threshold of DAI generated and grow in liquidity as time progresses. However, we are not opposed to voting in rETH later as outlined by @teemulau.  [Signal Request] Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation & Resurrect the Burn   Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation - June 13, 2022 We have voted yes to the recent proposal with details below from our Maker Protocol Lead @Jf123. YES- For us, the decision here is pretty clear. If all goes well, this proposal gives value back to the Maker token itself and incentivizes risk-averse investors to contribute. Importantly, this decision takes into account the wants of both governance members and token holders, somewhat reaching a consensus as outlined by @rema. Even in the off chance that these operations fail in practice, the protocol further develops DssKiln and will not reimplement this initiative after this trial is over. ### Temporarily Disable the Aave DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) - June 15, 2022   We have voted yes for this Executive proposal, in line with how, we voted in the forums previously. We believe eliminating this risk is important given current market conditions and evaluating again in future weeks. However, we think the points @Juanbug brings up are valid and well stated.  ",

We are open to onboarding XSGD as market conditions improve. We have worries on the liquidity of this asset as well as its capabilities to generate profitable/sensible amounts of DAI for Maker.

                    "content": "1/2 Lending Oversight (LOVE-001) Core Unit MIP : YES For this controversial poll, we voted YES for a number of reasons. To first argue for the devil\u2019s advocate, the responsibilities of the proposed LOVE-001 CU overlaps with that of RWF as well as Risk; however, we still see potential benefits of a Lending Oversight Core Unit. @luca_pro has been working behind the scenes for months now for developments regarding RWF as well as Risk and more. The advisory role that LOVE-001 provides is already somewhat present, we hope to make it official and develop this branch of Maker in the future. From other party\u2019s interactions as well as previous track record, we have faith in Luca to lead the CU to the best of his abilities and add an extra layer of checks and balances to Maker. A budget-neutral oversight committee over all the structured finance projects is needed to better manage risk and investments. However, we would not be opposed to expanding the responsibilities of existing CU\u2019s as a substitute. - https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWYajMq MIP4c2-SP20: MIP16 Amendments: YES We voted YES. There wasn\u2019t much contention regarding this topic, we believe that more time for governance teams to draft up changes means better developments and more stability for the protocol in the long term. - https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qmerh2xJ MIP40c3-SP69: Modify Core Unit Budget - Strategic Finance (SF-001): Approve Increased budget, Approve existing budget only We approve of a budget increase for SF-001. Maker has a lot of idle funds that can be used to bolster the protocol, and we believe that SF is the best party for this task. There is a bit of hesitation on the hiring end as if more individuals are hired during bull markets, they may become liabilities in the bear. However, we appreciate the detail and changes in the budget regarding different market conditions as outlined by @Aes. - https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmVMc78Z MIP40c3-SP70: Modify Growth Core Unit Budget, GRO-001: Approve Increased budget, Approve existing budget only We approve of increasing GRO-001\u2019s budget to the basegrowth option. We believe that branding and growth is integral to any protocol, but especially Maker due to its longevity and lasting impacts. Although the numbers may be a bit skewed for some aspects of the budget, we believe that GRO-001 has a plan for different market conditions to continue to bolster the influence of Maker and DAI. - https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmdMkg2N#vote-breakdown MIP41c4-SP34: Facilitator Onboarding (IS-001): ABSTAIN We do not think we have enough interaction with the proposed facilitator to make a decision at this point in time. - https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmaR6q4L MIP41c4-SP35: Facilitator Onboarding (DIN-001): ABSTAIN We do not think we have enough interaction with the proposed facilitator to make a decision at this point in time. - https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWhsLCU MIP55c3-SP4: Adding a Special Purpose Fund - Makershire Hathaway: YES We voted YES on Makershire Hathaway. From the forums, we think that a large portion of the community understands Makershire as a form of prop trading instead of \u201csafe\u201d yield farming strategies to increase the presence of DAI on L2s and other chains. With safe strategies (or as safe as you can get in this industry), Makershire\u2019s returns will be somewhat consistent. We highly support the end goal of automating these strategies, but we are concerned with management as the space is constantly changing. Regardless, our discussions with @Aes and other proponents of this poll alleviated our hesitations, and we support this initiative as long as transparency exists and Maker holders still have a say in these strategies. - https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmZjU2pG ",

While a burn may be controversial, we do not agree with voting against this proposal simply for the possibility of a burn. Rather, we believe that this proposal is important simply to further develop DssKiln. MIP75: Task Forces: YES We voted YES. From our understanding, task forces allow communication between CU\u2019s to become more efficient. While some details may need to be ironed out, we believe that the idea behind the proposal is beneficial to Maker. MIP75c2-SP1: Onboard Task Force - Growth Task Force: Approve task force and associated authority to spend funds, approve task force without associated authority to spend funds We support this initiative.

                    "content": "Asset Allocation of MIP65/Clydesdale We voted ABSTAIN. At the time of the initial vote regarding the initiative as a whole, we were not present as a delegate. As such, we had no say in the initial proposal. Regarding the allocation of the 500M DAI, we would like to vote Abstain. In practice, the strategies outlined on the forum regarding MIP65 will allow Maker to capitalize on opportunities that current idle assets can provide. In the current climate of rising interest rates, 500M DAI in fairly low-risk, liquid assets will undoubtedly generate yield for Maker. However, we decided to vote abstain as this proposal is a bit contradictory in principle. As a DeFi service, we think that \u201clonging\u201d US bonds goes against the principle of the protocol. Prioritization Sentiment - Technical Resource Deployment - June 6, 2022 We ranked the choices: Compound D3M, Maker Teleport, DssKiln. We believe that D3M in general is revolutionary for the protocol as it expands DAI\u2019s influence in DeFi in addition to another use case for the currency. Even if Compound should be regarded as somewhat of a competitor, collaboration between the two protocols is needed in current market conditions. We ranked Maker Teleport second because an official DAI bridge for other chains will become a high-demand product in the future. Specifically, DAI\u2019s dominance on other chains has slowly been dwindling. Hopefully, Maker Teleport can somewhat increase the presence of DAI throughout different major chains. Lastly, we put DssKiln; however, it is by no means unimportant. As we have previously stated for our votes regarding permissionless open market operations, DssKiln\u2019s development is necessary. The potential of DssKiln and the related operations to improve slippage, efficiently perform transactions, and more can only be reached if there is a focus on further developing the initiative. Prioritization Sentiment - Collateral Class - June 6, 2022 We feel that Peg Stability Solutions, Core Crypto Collateral, and RWA vaults encompass the core products of Maker. Importantly, a focus on these collateral classes expands the use-case for DAI. These are all areas of contention that have the potential to generate substantial revenue and value. ",

Operating at a loss for some time will be beneficial to Maker\u2019s growth in the long-term despite short-term costs. We are not opposed to the Break-even choice as well. However, we do believe that clarified metrics for evaluating CU productivity is needed. HVB Onboarding We voted YES. Both parties have aligned interest in achieving the maximum sustainable yield. Both parties also benefit as a result of this proposal in yield and returns for Maker as well as a higher lending limit for HVB.

                    "content": "MIP6: Declaration of Intent \u2013 Backed Finance (Discussion) YES - The introduction of short-term bonds into MakerDAO is something that we\u2019ve been looking forward to for a while now. However, we have a few concerns as shared by other members of the community. Although Backed Finance has answered multiple questions regarding the legal aspects of this proposal, we are still wary of regulatory pressure of onboarding a tokenized US Security. Regardless, if the worst case scenario (from our understanding through the forum) is a 1-1 redemption of the underlying bonds due to stringent regulations, we feel as if this is fairly low-risk especially if the legal and security concerns are ironed out. We hope to see bIBTA\u2019s PSM come into fruition soon despite the RWA internal restructuring. We will continue to monitor the process as we have reservations noted above. Tactical Reallocation Process for Budget Adjustments (Discussion) ABSTAIN - Since responsibilities and market conditions are always changing, it makes sense that the budget for CUs does too as their amount of work changes. As such, we support a tactical reallocation of funds rather than percentage cut in principle. However, we voted abstain due to a number of reasons:  From our understanding, the time-sensitive nature of this proposal may result in rushed KPIs and goals/responsibilities for CUs. 3 KPIs for each CU \u2013 with a max of 5 \u2013 may be too much to follow, resulting in unknowledgeable voting on critical areas of Maker growth. While a tracker for KPIs (similar to the governance dashboard) assists with the organization of these KPIs, we are still wary of Maker holders\u2019 and delegates\u2019 abilities to be completely up to date. We also do not support a broad-based percentage cut as we believe that budgets need to be flexible and reflect changing conditions. They need to be re-evaluated on a regular basis. UPDATE: We don\u2019t think that these two are the only solutions to the budget adjustment problem that Maker has arrived at. Specifically, we urge others to look at the new post by @Juan on project-based budgeting.  Maker Teleport on Starknet (Discussion) YES - We support expanding Maker/DAI into a quickly-growing Ethereum rollup. DAI\u2019s presence on Layer-2\u2019s has been fairly minimal; however, the market share has increased in the past month. We see this proposal as another means to increase the liquidity and influence of DAI into different ecosystems. Noting the success of DAI expansions on Arbitrum and Optimism, we have confidence in SECU and PECU and their abilities. However, there are reservations that still persist. The bridge brings a lot of risk with the tx oracle as well as the amount of trust Maker puts in third parties. Jumping on an early opportunity to capitalize on a growing rollup is enticing; however, we would like to see a risk and legal framework being further developed in the near future prior to launch. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal (Discussion) ABSTAIN - Following the aftermath of the 3AC contagion, many CeFi protocols have blown up as well \u2013 some directly as a result of 3AC, others as a result of market conditions. As such, it\u2019s clear that their risk assessments and capacity is different from that of DeFi protocols. However, the lowering of vault fees to incentivize demand is a two-sided sword in our view. DeFi lending and borrowing has dramatically decreased in the past months, lowering fees may not be enough for market participants to become risk-on. Moreover, with Maker\u2019s budget discussions currently going on, we consider the reduction in revenue to be somewhat substantial. Moreover, we believe that other incentives can exist such as Maker Rewards capped at \u201cX\u201d amount \u2013 an idea visited a couple of weeks ago. ",

                    "content": "MIP6: Pando Investment Grade Climate Assets Collateral Onboarding (Discussion) - ABSTAIN It was extremely hard for us to make a yes or no decision on this proposal. Discussion amongst ourselves led to a standstill, and reading the points brought up by DAO contributors and delegates could not break this standstill. In the end, we decided to abstain as we support the principle/heart of this proposal but cannot, in good conscience, support its parameters. We support the idea and intention behind the proposal for a number of reasons. 1. Pando\u2019s investment grade solar loans is a form of clean money that speaks to the potential of MakerDAO and DeFi as a whole in the real world. The partnership would be more than simply just a government bond as is the case with other RWA. This is a further step towards pushing the industry into mainstream attention, gathering positive publicity for the protocol and industry. 2. From Pando\u2019s responses, it\u2019s clear that a lot of time and effort has been put into alleviating MakerDAO\u2019s concerns on the risk of these loans. A. We understand that there is a very low-risk of default. Investment-grade entities default at a historic rate of 0.03% - 0.3%. B. Even in the scenario where multiple homes default, Pando posits that they, with others, would be able to absorb around 1900 loans out of a pool of 5000. This means that approximately 38% of homes will need to default in order for Maker\u2019s return to be impacted as noted by @Dori. C. Pando further says that the loans will be liquid enough for MakerDAO to offload in an liquidation event. Institutions and other entities are already buying up these bonds, and it\u2019s expected that 3 months would be enough to liquidate said assets. From a RWA point of view, the liquidity of these loans shouldn\u2019t be a problem. With that being said, there are a number of concerns that we have with the conditions of this proposal.  The solar loans have a weighted-average-life (WAL) of 6 years with a 14-year maturity. These time horizons are longer than Maker itself. As such, we don\u2019t think that we can truly gauge the risk involved with a transaction of this size and length. However, this risk will need to be taken in the future as the protocol scales. Compared to crypto-native assets, these loans are considered illiquid. A verbal guarantee of these loans being able to be liquidated isn\u2019t enough considering the size of the transaction. Even compared to other RWA, solar loans are less illiquid as well from our point of view. This raises another question of how much of Maker\u2019s balance sheet should be RWA; however, this is a topic for another day. We\u2019d like to see further downside protection. For instance, clauses where transactions are only brought forward after a certain condition is met. The yield generated from these loans is lower than the yield that Maker can obtain through other assets. The transaction yields approximately 2.9% or lower compared to 5% for other A loans with more protection for MakerDAO as expressed in the forum discussion.  We would like to reiterate that we are not opposed to this transaction due to the loans themselves or Pando Climate Inc. Rather, we think that the conditions are not too favourable for MakerDAO at this time; however, we would like to see these discussions be continued when RWF CU is cleared up as well. As such, we have decided to abstain for this vote. ",

At the current moment, we do not support this proposal for a number of reasons:   The Events CU was on-boarded a bit less than 4 months ago \u2013 not enough time to gauge their success or impact in our opinion. In this time, they have organized multiple events for different conferences.   Events are not limited to only parties. We think that the mandate of the Events CU includes hackathons, conferences, and more. We would like the CU to properly expand their operations before making an offboarding decision.   Events CU acknowledges their high budget of ~900,000 DAI. As such, they\u2019ve proposed initiatives to reduce this budget such as cost-splitting with other protocols, actively looking for ways to reduce the CU\u2019s budgetary pressure on the DAO.   As per @PonJerry\u2019s post on the forum. Offboarding Events CU saves ~150,000 DAI instead of the entire ~900,000 DAI budget.   Events are necessary in order for Maker and DAI to increase their brand recognition. Even as a cornerstone of DeFi, marketing and education is needed. Events are a medium to do so and are more than necessary with the proliferation of stablecoins in the industry.   There are currently discussions surrounding the CU offboarding framework. We think it\u2019s only fair to conclude these discussions prior to any offboardings at the moment.   We would be open to a few ideas/changes raised in the discussion.  Budgetary constraints as ~900,000 DAI is a bit much in our view as well. However, we understand that hosting events takes somewhat of an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d type of mentality in order to make a lasting impact. Transparency on the operations of the CU is needed. This can include regular updates on the current projects of the CU, data collection on events turnout, potential partnerships, etc. We\u2019d like a clear roadmap of what types of events will be hosted in the future with an approximate timeline as well. Many good ideas on possible events were given in the discussion. We\u2019d like to see these come into fruition. A possible merger between Events, Growth and PR, and Strategic Happiness. We agree that some of the responsibilities between these CUs overlap. As such, we would not be opposed to exploring a possible merger between the three or a combination of the three to reduce spending.  We appreciate @PonJerry\u2019s professionalism throughout this process. All in all, we don\u2019t think that enough time has been given for events to showcase what they can provide. MIP4c2-SP15: Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments (Discussion) YES - We support this additional framework to the offboarding process. We believe that it provides clarity and organization to offboarding proposals as well as improving the information asymmetry that currently exists. We support any clear initiative that will help streamline this process. MIP4c2-SP23: MIP50 Direct Deposit Module Amendment (Discussion) YES - Pretty much a no-brainer for us. We supported the first iteration of D3M. We support an amendment to generalize the operations so that it extends beyond AAVE. MIP40c3-SP74: Modify Dai Foundation Core Unit Budget, DAIF-001 (Discussion) Bear Scenario, Base - While we are leaning towards the Super Bear scenario due to current market and macro conditions, we are not very knowledgeable about Intellectual property laws. As such, we\u2019ve decided in favour of the Bear scenario proposed by the DAI Foundation. As stated by the CU facilitator, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry in the case of an IP attack. We support a slight reduction in the DAI foundation budget so that they\u2019re able to normally continue their operations with some flexibility. MIP40c3-SP75: Modify Oracle Core Unit Budget, ORA-001 (Discussion) Approve Proposed Budget - We appreciate the CU proactively looking for ways to reduce their spending. We agree with the sentiment that security should not be outsourced. Many exploits, such as Blizz Finance during the $LUNA crash, occur due to oracle and security responsibilities being outsourced. We support the reduction in budget especially if it means that the CU will continue with their operations similar to before. We would like to see more discussion on the changes to the vesting or compensation parameters of the protocol as a whole in the future. MIP76: Makershire Redux (Discussion) YES - We supported Makershire from its inception as one of our first votes. Despite this, we shared concerns with the community on the security and allocation of the proposal. We appreciate the amendments made by the SF CU. While Maker\u2019s governance may be convoluted at times, we are grateful that all aspects of risk is covered within a proposal, specifically the multi-sig concern in the previous Makershire proposal. The proposed strategies, although less yield than volatile assets, alleviates the risk of impermanent loss with stables and is a safe investment (as safe as it can get in this space). While external party risks (multi-sig, admin key, defaults, etc.) still exist as noted by @monet-supply, we are willing to take these risks due to their lower likelihood with the proposed strategies. The 10 million DAI is allocated across different chains, further reducing the risk of a counterparty compromise. Moreover, since the proposal can be reassessed after 12 months, we think that this is an extremely beneficial \u201ctrial\u201d that utilizes currently idle funds. ",

                    "content": "Greenlight Polls: RWA Arranger (BlockTower Credit) (Discussion, Portal) ABSTAIN - It\u2019s great to see BlockTower taking an active interest in MakerDAO through their arranger application after their continued participation in Maker through the past few years. Although our final decision is to abstain, this will change as time progresses. Our reasoning is as follows: From our understanding, the arranger model has been debated on in the past regarding RWAs, specifically whether or not it is necessary for the DAO\u2019s success. In the perfect scenario, we think that there is more efficiency in working directly with the lending counterparty rather than through an arranger model. As we have already seen shortcomings and obstacles in onboarding RWA as collateral, we understand that there is somewhat of a need for an arranger. Additionally, others have voiced the concern of a lack of oversight regarding an arranger. As there are current shortcomings and deadlocks in governance, we think that ironing these issues out first would be more beneficial. Regardless, We have faith that both BlockTower Credit and Centrifuge will put Maker interests first with lower-risk collateral ; however, we cannot wholeheartedly support the greenlight given current circumstances. As the poll will be passing due to majority support. We will continue to keep up to date with developments and reach a consensus on this topic later on. Cabot (Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining LLC) (Discussion, Portal) NO - Clean energy may be a beneficial mandate for MakerDAO in terms of optics; however, we are unsure whether it or not it needs to be. From our view, there are more pressing issues and scalability decisions for Maker than clean energy. Moreover, most of Maker\u2019s collateral follows BTC and crypto markets. Expansion into RWA\u2019s is supposed to diversify this risk; onboarding Cabot means that the underlying assets will be correlated with the crypto market as well. We are also concerned with liquidity issues and finding buyers in a liquidation event. Due to these reasons, we will not be supporting this poll at this time. DDC (Detox Digital Coin) (Discussion, Portal) NO - Our sentiment for both greenlight polls are the same. While different concerns exist for DDC, we don\u2019t believe that there has been enough discussion. This is not the fault of the counterparty but rather the RWA CU reorganization currently taking place. We\u2019d like to have internal clarity prior to moving forward \u2013 a concern for both Cabot and DDC. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal (Discussion, Portal) Option 2 - We support lowering the stability fees in order to increase DAI liquidity and dominance. Ratification Poll for Legal Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral (bIBTA) Special Purpose Fund (MIP55c3-SP6) (Discussion, Portal) YES - Regardless of the underlying collateral (which we originally supported), we\u2019d like the onboarding process to be as efficient as possible. We understand that there\u2019s some contention regarding the mandate of Strategic Finance in overseeing the legal domain of this partnership. While we do not agree with how these responsibilities were delegated behind closed doors, we do not see a reason to prolong the process more. HVBank Drawdown, Maker Teleport Launch on Optimism and Arbitrum (Portal) - August 31, 2022 YES - We are supporting the HVBank drawdown and Maker Teleport on Optimism and Arbitrum as voiced previously.

Not granting these funds would unnecessarily delay progress as well as negatively impact Maker\u2019s reputation. Short Ratification Poll for MIP65 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP4) - September 5, 2022 YES - Given the situation in RWF, it makes sense to change the previous parameters. MKR Pro-Rata Vesting for former RWF-001 Members - September 5, 2022 NO - Similar to the sentiment of other delegates, approving this proposal sets a dangerous precedent for Maker moving forward. While the circumstances surrounding RWF are unconventional, the vesting period was agreed upon previously. They can contribute to the DAO in other capacities, but their shares should follow the original vesting schedule. Updating HVBank (RWA-009) Legal Agreements - September 5, 2022 YES - No hesitation to support updating the legal wording of the agreements. Glad to see more clarity and additional detail. Executive Vote: Core Unit MKR Vesting, Recognized Delegate Compensation, MOMC Parameter Changes - September 07, 2022 We voted yes; the reasons have been given prior. ",

Further, there are liquidity concerns as raised by other delegates. Ultimately, we do not think that the revenue and other benefits of this proposal make up for the costs. Community Greenlight Poll - GAMMA UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC (Gamma Uniswap v3 wBTC-renBTC) - September 5, 2022 NO - When the overlapping limit is not in range then the position will be dependent on renBTC or entirely in WBTC (more likely in renBTC). We think collateralized assets in the vault should be distributed more equally and believe most holders do not want Maker to become a tokenized bitcoin asset. There is an additional centralization risk coupled with the point above that we do not think is beneficial to Maker. Community Greenlight Poll - GNO (GnosisDAO) - September 5, 2022 YES - We are voting yes to this proposal. Gnosis Chain is decentralized with DAI being the dominant stablecoin. The DAO has been long supporters of Maker, and we would like to see the partnership evolve. The proposal increases DAI dominance and revenue for Maker; however, we are concerned with the illiquidity as brought up by other delegates. Ratification Poll for Amend Measurement Period For Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP24) - September 12, 2022 YES - We support this proposal to change delegate participation metrics as it decreases the punishment for short-term lack of participation for whatever personal reasons and increases the need for continued participation. Ratification Poll for the MakerDAO Delegates MIP Set - September 12, 2022 ABSTAIN - We think that it\u2019s a conflict of interest for delegates to be voting on delegate compensation. However, vested Maker aligns the incentives of delegates and the protocol further, but with the recent budgetary changes, it is unfair to increase delegate compensation in any form. Ratification Poll for MKR Compensation for StarkNet Engineering Core Unit, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP79) - September 12, 2022 YES - We are supporting this proposal to ensure that the partnership between Starknet and Maker remains not only intact, but strong. The team has delivered through their hard work within a sector where good talent is hard to find. Their impact to the protocol cannot be understated and we believe in rewarding them for their work and time. Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for The Ambassador Program (MIP55c3-SP7) - September 12, 2022 YES - Fairly easy yes in our view; there is an undeniable, growing interest in Maker in the LatAm community. We would like to continue this growth. Ratification Poll for Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP80) - September 12, 2022 First Choice: 100% Second Choice: 150% We think that the proposed amount of MKR is quite high with a fairly short vesting period as well. Clearer guidelines to compensation should be set across CU\u2019s, and as such, we support the 100% MKR payout. We are okay with the 150% option due to the continued support and work by the GovAlpha team although it does raise some small concerns. Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Offboarding (MIP39c3-SP2) - September 12, 2022 NO - Given how new the CU is, we think that more time is needed to accurately examine the capabilities and potential of the team. We believe that it\u2019s too soon to offboard them at this current time. However, if the offboarding were to go through, we would rather the terms listed in Rune\u2019s post. ",

Community Greenlight Poll - RFA (RFA - Canadian Federally Regulated Mortgage Originator) - September 19, 2022 NO - At this point in time, we do not think it\u2019s in the best interest of the protocol to onboard RWA given the continued convoluted situation in RWF CU. However, we would strongly like to revisit this proposal when the organizational issues have been resolved.

Community Greenlight Poll - ANCHORAGE (Anchorage Lending Crypto Mining) - October 3, 2022 Because of the ongoing restructuring/issues with RWA, it\u2019s not a good time to onboard. Can be reconsidered when internal organizational structure is fixed. Executive: Monetalis Clydesdale (RWA007-A) Onboarding, Funding Ambassador Program SPF, Core Unit MKR Streams and Transfers - October 5, 2022 YES - We support the new vault onboarding and Monetalis\u2019 continued partnership with Maker, the additional DAI for ambassadors, and the respective Maker for CUs. MIP10c9-SP31: Proposal to whitelist Oasis.app on rETHUSD Oracle YES - Oasis has the widest on-chain liquidity pool for the ETH/DAI market, hence whitelisting Oasis will onboard new users, increasing the access for rETH/USD. While there is a oracle concern, we trust the oracle team and their due diligence. Change PSM-GUSD-A Parameters - October 10, 2022 YES -  The adjustment is clearly a response to the GUSD and MakerDAO marketing incentive and partnership that favours PSM vaults. From a macro lens, the change will decrease the  reliance on USDC as well as gain interest from Gemini for Maker. End DAI Funding For Sourcecred YES -  Onboarding and elevating community members to participate in the Maker ecosystem is crucial for governance and enables checks and balances. The question to be asked is are there better alternatives (community) and how do we implement a system that prevents abusive behaviors while providing governance mining incentives. We hope to see GovAlpha\u2019s next iteration of an incentive system to top that of Sourcecred in its early days. MOMC Guidance - Remove ETH Supply Yield And Liquidity Incentives From D3M Target Borrow Rate Calculations - October 10, 2022 As market conditions change, it makes sense for the Aave D3M to be updated as well given that the supply rate changed. We support the recommendations based on the calculations for this proposal MOMC Guidance - Allowed Spread Between D3M Target Borrow Rate And ETH-A Stability Fee October 10, 2022 Option 1 - 0.5%, Option 2 - 0% We support a target spread of 0.5% with its respective conditions as it provides a window for change and helps Maker keep up with Aave. While revenue is lower compared to 0%, we hold more importance in DAI adoption and don\u2019t think that the spread should be 0% as of now. ",

We support this proposal as it contains a traditional \u201cGolden Parachute\u201d clause. However, we would like to emphasize and hope that this will not set a precedent for vested MKR to be immediately available. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Events Core Unit - EVENTS-001 (MIP39c3-SP4) - October 10, 2022 YES - Similar reasoning as above.

Regardless of future protocol changes, we think that this offboarding has been a long time coming. We understand that Will has been a key contributor to Maker for quite some time; however, the offboarding is justified given the events that have transpired throughout the year. While the blame does not solely rest on Will, the divisiveness of the RWF CU has not helped Maker\u2019s already convoluted structure. Additionally, with the onboarding of many different RWA vaults, a clearer mandate and better communication are needed for the Maker party responsible Ratification Poll for Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP81) - October 10, 2022 and Ratification Poll for Monetalis-Coinbase Appaloosa (MIP82) - October 10, 2022 YES - Currently, the asset within the PSM is sitting idle, even if 1.5% may not be the highest, we support a partnership with an established player of the industry although centralized. We understand that there\u2019s a certain stigma around Maker\u2019s decentralization and stance by partnering with Coinbase as noted by some members of the community but the rewards in both yield as well as exposure are worth the risk in our opinions. We would like to see more information on operations from Coinbase\u2019s end as it is a large sum. Additionally, continued monitoring of the position and its liquidity is needed as well. However, we do note the counterparty risks involved with these proposals. Ratification Poll for Legal And Commercial Risk Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral BlockTower Credit - RWA Arranger SPF (MIP55c3-SP9) - October 10, 2022 YES - We support allocating additional funds for the legal work as it is a necessary part of their responsibilities. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding Process (MIP41c5) adjustments (MIP4c2-SP26) - October 10, 2022 YES - Voting yes on this poll as it provides a more efficient and clear process for offboarding facilitators.

Executive: Enable DC-IAM for RWA-007-A (Monetalis Clydesdale), GUSD PSM Parameter Changes - October 13 , 2022 Supporting the parameter upgrades to Monetalis Clydesdale and parameter changes to the GUSD PSM.

While it may be simply an accounting issue and not a priority, we see no harm in clearing this debt up now quickly. One Month Budget Extension for Strategic Happiness Core Unit - October 31, 2022 NO - While we appreciate all the work that SHCU has done, we don\u2019t think that it\u2019s correct for Maker to issue an extension. The CU would be offboarded by then, and we agree with the argument that these costs should\u2019ve been noted within the original proposal as voiced by other delegates. We would not be opposed to project-specific budget allocations in special circumstances such as this in the future. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - October 31, 2022 YES - We support reducing Maker\u2019s exposure to riskier vaults through the noted parameter changes.

Add the Compound V2 DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) - November 7, 2022 YES - Given the success of Maker\u2019s previous D3M, we support adding this new D3M.

Stablecoin Vault Liquidation Parameters and Auction Activation - November 14, 2022 YES - Supporting this poll as an extension of the related previous poll. We believe that the clearance of bad debt (USDC-A and USDP-A vaults) is a responsible measure. While there are no current GUSD-A vaults that are above the collateral ratio, we believe that it is fitting to impose liquidation measures on these vaults as the DAO continues to monitor market conditions.

Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Development and UX Core Unit (DUX-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP82) - November 14, 2022 New-Base, Existing - We appreciate the changes that the DUX team have pushed recently, such as the gas-less poll voting integration. Given the current industry outlook as well as their past spending habits, we think that that the new-base option is sufficient for the team. However, given Maker\u2019s strategic shift into the Endgame framework, we are expecting a significant change in workload. Ratification Poll for CoinShares Active Treasury Management (MIP86) - November 14, 2022 NO - We vote in alignment with the vast majority on this proposal. Using external asset managers is beyond protocol risk tolerance, even if CoinShares has demonstrated their worth over the last bull market. Ratification Poll for OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) - November 14, 2022 NO - This proposal exposes the DAO to many risk factors that would trump the reward. In addition to risk concerns presented by @rema, we would like to emphasize OUSD\u2019s declining active user base and market dominance (https://analytics.ousd.com/). We cannot deposit $100m in exchange for illiquid assets and heavy penalties in case of withdrawal. More importantly, the DAO is looking for responsible opportunities to enhance its revenue, not making risky \u201cseed round\u201d bets described by Origin\u2019s team. Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Mandate (MIP39c2-SP38) - November 14, 2022 and Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security (IS-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP83) - November 14, 2022 NO and Reject Budget - We are not in support of this change given the next phase of Maker\u2019s development and the role that Immunefi will play. Further, we are unsure of the necessity of having Immunefi\u2019s responsibilities be a separate CU. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Governance Communications Core Unit DAI Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP84) - November 14, 2022 Approve reduced budget - We are inclined to support the limited budget reduction (86% of original) as a response to worsening market conditions and incentive standards accepted by the DAO. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit DAI Budget, SAS-001 (MIP40c3-SP85) - November 14, 2022 Reject Budget - We would like to reject the majority of core unit funding proposals that don\u2019t include sufficient reasoning for the funding. @Llama makes a good point in that these could be additions run externally. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget, TECH-001 (MIP40c3-SP86) - November 14, 2022 Abstain - We are abstaining from this poll as we are unsure of the complete KPIs of the TechOps CU as well as possible changes in responsibilities going into Endgame. Due to the necessity/control of this CU over other parts of Maker, we think that a rejection would be too harsh. Ratification Poll for Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit (MIP84c10-SP1) - November 14, 2022 NO - We vote in alignment with the vast majority of holders that voted. MakerDAO should not be expanding into off-chain assets. We support a risk-free approach. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Redwood Friesian (MIP88) - November 14, 2022 No - We don\u2019t support high ask amount of this proposal. This, in addition to the greater exposure to counterparty risk is our reasoning. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Arrow Andalusian (MIP89) - November 14, 2022 NO - Due to current market conditions, we believe the DAO needs to conduct further due diligence when evaluating proposals of this scale especially with the high counterparty risk that subsequent Monetalis proposals may include. Regardless of reputation, diversification is important. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit DAI Budget, SES-001 (MIP40c3-SP87) - November 14, 2022 Approve standard option budget - After core units are deprecated, there will need to be further restructuring to the SES that makes this budget change unnecessary until further action needed. Stablecoin Vault Liquidation Parameters and Auction Activation - November 14, 2022 YES - We support the effort to clean up legacy bad debt. We vote in favor of this proposal. ",

Dai Foundation Board Member Election Poll - December 12, 2022 Daimon-Law: To preface, both candidates have a stellar track record and both would be great additions as a Foundation board member. We ended up choosing Paul due to his experience specifically within crypto. There is no doubt that both candidates legal expertise will be beneficial to Maker in the foreseeable future; however, Paul\u2019s crypto-native experience (which should be monitored in case of conflicts of interest), web3 startup focused law firm, and detailed vision within his candidate statements gave him a slight edge over Jacob in our opinion. Regardless, we hope that both candidates continue to contribute to the success of Maker. Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit (SAS-001) Funding Request - December 12, 2022 YES - We support the SAS funding request prior to its official offboarding and for the continuation of its current endeavours until then.

Given that Gemini has met their end of the pre-established partnership (increasing revenue for Maker in a time where revenues across the sector are decreasing) and the legal oversight over Gemini, we would like to keep the PSM as is. Additionally, the concerns by the community over GUSD is justified, but we don\u2019t believe that these changes will significantly decrease Maker\u2019s exposure. Ratification Poll for Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP29) - January 9, 2023 YES to both - Although we support these changes, we echo the sentiment that abstaining is a fair choice. There is a concern about the quality of votes given these changes in the future. Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (MIP4c2-SP28) - January 9, 2023 YES - It\u2019s important to adapt to important developments regardless of the time. Especially in an industry where things constantly update, we\u2019d like to see the exception shortened from a month Ratification Poll for MIP14 Repeal (MIP4c4-SP2) - January 9, 2023 NO - Due to the uncertainty during Maker\u2019s transition, MIP-14 should be kept in the off-chance that it is needed. Ratification Poll for Obsolete MIP Removal (MIP23, MIP28) (MIP4c4-SP3) - January 9, 2023 YES - Doesn\u2019t seem to be a need for these MIPs which have been out of use for an extremely long time. Ratification Poll for Remove MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) (MIP4c2-SP32) - January 9, 2023 YES - Similar reasoning to (MIP4c4-SP2). The cap should be removed for now given the uncertainty of the transition period. Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding (COM-001) (MIP39c3-SP7) - January 9, 2023 Full Payout - We are voting for the full payout given the continued past contributions of GovComms. Well-deserved that the CU receives the full payout. Ratification Poll for Requesting Protocol DAI Transfer to fund TechOps CU for February 2023 (MIP14c2-SP1) - January 9, 2023 YES - Supporting this as a temporary solution given the earlier rejected proposed budget.

The DAI peg is important to my platform; as a stablecoin, we must comply with DAI holders\u2019 expectations.  Revenue: Developing core, complementary products to ensure that revenue is stable, not seasonal, and attempting to eliminate market-driven volatility from the DAO\u2019s bottom line. To achieve this, we need strong ALM, RWF and DAI use cases.  Data-Driven: With core products (PSM, Vault Lending, RWF, DAI L1/L2 adoption) running smoothly, MKR has a trove of data and bandwidth to test new features and products to remain competitive and innovative.  Unbiased: I participate in open discussions and working sessions from all MakerDAO participants, while practicing and promoting disciplined productivity. Initiatives such as Proof Of Humanity or Gitcoin Passport will be seen positively by my platform.  Delegate Statement My objective for becoming a delegate is to support growth initiatives that will lead to broader DAI adoption and bring value to MKR token holders. I view product rollouts, innovative ideas and DAI adoption (i.e., expanding DAI use cases) very favorably.  By expanding DAI use cases and therefore DAI holders, we benefit from potential organic revenue growth. In addition, we support MakerDAO in its mission to turn DAI into the main digital currency, while maintaining its core values as unbiased, decentralized and asset-backed. The DAO\u2019s mission can only be accomplished with a healthy liquidity buffer that will enable it to experiment, test and adapt to a rapidly changing world. Another key aspect of my objective in becoming a delegate is my passion for financial education and equitable access. While TradFi thrives on uninformed participants and limited availability of products (i.e., the privileged few with resources and connections), MakerDAO can support users new to the financial system by using data-based lending services to offer transparent products and prices. In addition, via MakerDAO\u2019s forum, we provide crypto education and a welcoming community to existing and new users.  I believe MakerDAO\u2019s product should remain accessible and fair to all participants, even if that is at the expense of potential revenue growth; we should be able to develop opportunities that all can access because in the long-run, that will be better for user adoption and growth. I grew up in an Emerging Market, where I witnessed firsthand the impact of fiscally irresponsible and corrupt governments on hard-working communities. These feelings of injustice and experiences in my childhood led me to pursue a career in financial services.  My background in TradFi (capital markets at large, global banks) and as a small business owner gives me the knowledge necessary to participate in finance, sales, marketing and product management-related governance polls for MakerDAO. In addition, with my persistent curiosity, I educate myself on topics relevant to the DAO. My past posts and comments should allow you to understand my vision for the protocol, such as growth in DAI demand, sound ALM business practices, new features for revenue-generation, analysis of market opportunities (L1/L2, Argentina and El Salvador) and innovation for the flagship product (crypto-backed loans). In my view, the key to DAI\u2019s success is to successfully diversify DAI\u2019s collateral, use cases, counterparties and holders. To the extent another MakerDAO community member aligns with my views, I would be happy to consider partnering as a delegate team. To demonstrate my alignment with the protocol, I would invest the majority of any DAI compensation earned as a delegate back into MKR. Code of Conduct As a delegate, I commit to abide by the protocol\u2019s code of conduct and to provide dedication, respect and transparency to the entire MKR community. Conflicts of Interest I own ETH, MKR and other ERC20 tokens, which in aggregate represent less than 10% of my assets. I am not financially compensated by any other crypto project; if that changes (which I do not expect it to), I will inform the protocol in this post. I do not derive income from any potential partner or competitor of MakerDAO. Waiver of Liability By delegating to me, you acknowledge and agree that I participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to my participation in the Maker Protocol or MakerDAO.

Community Greenlight Poll - GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI (Gelato Uniswap v3 BUSD-DAI) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes (Greenlight)  Value: Risk  BUSD is a fast-growing stablecoin that benefits from being part of the most used CeX. With Binance\u2019s latest strategic move to consolidate stablecoin holdings into BUSD, it will continue to gain marketshare. Collateral diversification is one of the best ways to improve DAI\u2019s resilience and reduce counterparty exposure. ",

In its current form, recognized delegates are unable to recover from missed votes and suffer permanent inability to generate enough increase in metrics to hit compensation thresholds. Ratification Poll for the MakerDAO Delegates MIP Set - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Value: Community  Even though this MIP set will most likely reduce ONESTONE delegate compensation given the proposed changes to the compensation formula (its beneficial for delegates with higher delegation), these proposals create long-term incentive alignment with the inclusion of DAI and MKR compensation. Ratification Poll for MKR Compensation for StarkNet Engineering Core Unit, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP79) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Value: Growth  Although compensation is very competitive, StarkNet CU has earned it. Additionally, L2 developers and engineers are hard to find, and we found great ones. The compensation seems to be aligned with CU\u2019s with similar responsibilities. Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for The Ambassador Program (MIP55c3-SP7) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Value: Community  Excited to support this initiative, the benefits that it will create for the LATAM community far exceed the budget. This is a fast growing community in relation to new members, and it makes sense as DAI is the perfect product market fit for some of the largest countries in the region (e.g. Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, etc). I am confident that the brand awareness generated from the ambassador program has potential to create thousands of new DAI holders and hundreds of new community members. Ratification Poll for Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP80) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: 150% multiplier (247.70 total MKR) 2nd choice: 100% multiplier (165.14 total MKR) 3rd choice: 200% multiplier (330.27 total MKR) In our view, the compensation boost is well deserved by the GovAlpha CU, proving to be a neutral third party while facilitating many aspects of governance. Their work is essential to ensure the progress of MakerDAO, especially as the end game picks up / develops, and new revenue streams are introduced/proposed GovAlpha engagement is more crucial than ever. Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Offboarding (MIP39c3-SP2) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Value: Community  SHCU has accepted the off boarding terms and we support them in this decision.

It is an important exercise to perform self-assessment of existing process and make tough decisions such as this one to adapt to change and ensure DAI\u2019s success. Like any plan, it will most likely need to be revised as the new model sets in, especially around the new operating model and MetaDAOs tokenomics. Overall the end game strengthens DAI\u2019s resilience and sets a strategy for collateral that Maker was lacking in its current form Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Strategic Happiness Core Unit - SH-001 (MIP39c3-SP3) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Value: Community  Supporting this offboarding that has been improved from the prior version, providing the CU (a long standing member of the community) with offboarding compensation similar to what has been offered in other offboardings. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Events Core Unit - EVENTS-001 (MIP39c3-SP4) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Value: Community  Unfortunately, the timing of this CU\u2019s onboarding could not have been any worse. The market took a nose dive and the liquidations pushed the protocol to operate at a negative on a going forward basis with the existing budget. For that reason this offboarding is unfortunate because the quality of the work, even during offboarding discussions, has been top notch but needed to return to profitability. This is an important lesson to not inflate our work force during bull runs and instead look to expand existing CU (MetaDaos in the end game) or operate on a project basis. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Real-World Finance Core Unit - RWF-001 (MIP39c3-SP5) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Value: Community  Unfortunately the RWA vision failed due to lack of leadership vision, communication and internal toxicity. Its disappointing that the RWF ended this way, especially due to the quality of the work and due diligence process seemed exceptional, the culprit in my opinion was more in terms of setting a clear synergy between DAI and real world assets that MKR would target. In the end game this seems to be resolved (clean energy focus). Ratification Poll for Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP81) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Value: Revenue  Asset monetization is the main driver for DAI\u2019s success and MKRs ability to expand DAI\u2019s use cases globally onchain and offchain. This initiative has strong CU, community and delegate support due to the monetization of our large USDC position with a highly reputable counterparty. Even though the setup is not 100% trustless, the custodial arrangement is acceptable (low risk) and can be improved upon. The limited effort required to execute this proposal and generate millions of DAI is a no brainer, win-win situation for Maker and Coinbase. Ratification Poll for Monetalis-Coinbase Appaloosa (MIP82) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Value: Revenue  Similar to MIP81 (asset monetization). Happy to support this deal that is overcollateralized with BTC/ETH backed vaults to highly reputable counterparty, Coinbase.  The added risk is compensated with a higher return of 4-6% which matches the profile of this structure. Ratification Poll for Legal And Commercial Risk Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral BlockTower Credit - RWA Arranger SPF (MIP55c3-SP9) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Value: Revenue  Similar to MIP81 (Asset monetization) but also due to being an inflight process that does not make sense to end at this time due to the amount of work already been done Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding Process (MIP41c5) adjustments (MIP4c2-SP26) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Value: Community  Agree with this adjustment of reducing by a few weeks the offboarding governance period. The timing still allow the protocol to gather all the facts but also allow for a faster more efficient way to  to react to workforce situations Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding - RWF-001 (MIP41c5-SP12) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Value: Community  Supporting this proposal due to the way things unfolded in the forum and facilitator\u2019s inability to maintain professional working dynamics for such a crucial CU ",

We might not all agree but we are always able to respectfully move the project forward Polls Ratification Poll for Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Facilitator Onboarding (MIP41c4-SP38) - November 14, 2022  (thread) Voted: Yes  Supportive of Psychonaut\u2019s officially stepping up to facilitator role, IMO he has been acting as facilitator for IS-001 for some time now. He is the first to provide updates and communicate with the community about CU updates. alance, we support this change. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Development and UX Core Unit (DUX-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP82) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve reduced budget - NewBase 2nd choice: Approve reduced budget - NewBear I am pleased with the CU\u2019s performance, they provide high-quality metrics and dashboards. The ability to bring real time delegate information is crucial for voting transparency and maintaining a key pillar of the community, transparency. Given current budgetary environment agree with the NEWBASE budget and commend the CU for self-evaluating their budget projections. Ratification Poll for CoinShares Active Treasury Management (MIP86) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Although a portion of their assets are tangled with the FTX contagion, this only represents ~10% of their assets. CoinShares\u2019 proposal gives Maker an automatic adjustment that is reflective of current interest rate environment. I am pleased that they have used SOFR as a benchmark (compared to providing fixed rates below market rates that can changed at discretion) which will allows us to benefit from our CURRENT need of generating yield and increasing our surplus buffer to support more risky initiatives. Ratification Poll for OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: No  Risk CU\u2019s recommendations have persuaded my decision to not support this MIP, there are way too many risks involved for us to support this proposal. Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Mandate (MIP39c2-SP38) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Support of the mandate changes proposed for the IS-001 CU. Seems like an appropriate self-mandate adjustment to reflect the team\u2019s objectives. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security (IS-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP83) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve reduced budget - BearMarket 2nd choice: Reject budget This CU has proposed major budget cuts to their own budget, this on its own reflects positively on the CU\u2019s awareness of the DAO\u2019s current situation and overall crypto instability. The bug bounty project is a crucial program that needs proper management and administration. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Governance Communications Core Unit DAI Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP84) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Approve Budget  Supportive of this CU, realizing that GovComms has also decided to reflect on their budget and reduce as needed. Their laundry list of key activities is of critical priority for the projects and community to remain informed, from my experience I am confident that they provide on-time information for best decision making. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit DAI Budget, SAS-001 (MIP40c3-SP85) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Reject budget  I am rejecting this CU budget, their tasks could be combined or merged with another CU which would allow for better administration of tasks and even some automation. Maker\u2019s auction systems are working well, but because of high budget I believe that its excessive and should be reviewed. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget, TECH-001 (MIP40c3-SP86) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Approve Budget  Approving the TechOps CU budget, they have proven that their work is of upmost value to the community and also scarce to find elsewhere. Their mandate is crucial to maintain Maker\u2019s infrastructure running smoothly. Ratification Poll for Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit (MIP84c10-SP1) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain  Mixed feeling about increasing this limit. On the one side, we agree that the surplus buffer could benefit from a higher limit goal given our assets but on the other side the community has already shown their support for endgame. For that reason, I am not sure that at this time it makes sense to vote on this initiative. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Redwood Friesian (MIP88) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Supporting this initiative as proposed by the Viridian Cluster, asset deployment has been neglected for far too long in this protocol and its about time that we optimize our assets. This poll aligns with the recently approved endgame plan and allows the protocol to move in that direction. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Arrow Andalusian (MIP89) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Same response as above but with the added benefit of this initiative being ESG friendly. Supporting this initiative as proposed by the Viridian Cluster, asset deployment has been neglected for far too long in this protocol and its about time that we optimize our assets. This poll aligns with the recently approved endgame plan and allows the protocol to move in that direction. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit DAI Budget, SES-001 (MIP40c3-SP87) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve standard option budget  Supporting of the reduced budget requested by the very important SES CU.

I voted for 1% because it would be a number that would persuade some DAI holders of maintaining their assets in DAI instead of in a Savings account in TradFi at 3-4% and also might strengthen our position compared to other stablecoins. Also wanted to point that I voted for 1% over abstaining because there is a path for deploying our assets now and earning income from \u201cnew\u201d DAI inflows.  PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal (thread) Voted Yes As usual, supporting the vault adjustments as laid out by the OMC. Most of the changes seem to align to our current risk appetite, reducing exposure to illiquid collateral and incentivizing PSM usage.

Additionally as mentioned below, we believe the benefits to higher than the perceived risks associated with this partnership. Adjust the GUSD PSM Debt Ceiling - January 16, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: No change (500 million DAI). We support to not change the GUSD PSM Debt Ceiling, i.e. keeping it at 500 million DAI, is the best option because it preserves the status quo and allows for more time to evaluate the potential risks and benefits without significantly impacting our ability to benefit from the current rate environment. Additionally, the main reason for this decision is that by performing our own risk assessment and that of the community (Forum discussions), we believe the advantages of keeping the Debt Ceiling at 500 million DAI outweigh the perceived risks.

For more details, please contact us directly. Polls Ratification Poll for Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP29) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve both Value: Community  Both of these changes are necessary to ensure the long-term health and security of Maker. The first proposed change will reward Recognized Delegates for actively participating in on-chain polls, rather than just abstaining. The second proposed change will ensure that Recognized Delegates are engaged in Executive Votes and motivated to take swift action when needed. Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (MIP4c2-SP28) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: No This break is important for the health of the community, creates a time for strategic thinking, and allows the core workforce some downtown to recharge as needed. Ratification Poll for MIP14 Repeal (MIP4c4-SP2) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: No MIP14 may be a useful process for the future, as suggested by Patrick_J\u2019s comments as the protocol prepares for the endgame transition. Ratification Poll for Obsolete MIP Removal (MIP23, MIP28) (MIP4c4-SP3) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes This MIP is obsolete and should be removed to keep the MIPs Framework slim Ratification Poll for Remove MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) (MIP4c2-SP32) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes I support this poll to remove the Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling from MIP14 and allow the Maker Community to more easily access the necessary funds to serve the Maker Protocol Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding (COM-001) (MIP39c3-SP7) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve Offboarding, 60,700 DAI Golden Parachute and 100% Multiplier for retroactive MKR - additional 107,317.50 DAI (CU-preferred) Value: Community  David should be provided with a reasonable and balanced offboarding process for COM-001, including the 100% multiplier for retroactive MKR. This is in the best interest of governance, as we have previously outlined the need for a fair and decent resolution for those leaving the organization. We should ensure David is supported throughout the entire process and hope that he is able to join the protocol as we transition to the endgame Ratification Poll for Requesting Protocol DAI Transfer to fund TechOps CU for February 2023 (MIP14c2-SP1) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes I support this proposal to fund the team, critical infrastructure, tools, and services through the month of February and look forward to seeing the budget for the month of March.

This expenditure is essential. Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for developing Proof-of-Performance for Viridian Cluster (MIP55c3-SP13) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: No I agree that there is overlap and competition between SF CU and the Viridian Cluster\u2019s monitoring of RWA among other activities that are part of SF\u2019s CU. Last year\u2019s vote commentary outlined some of the Cluster\u2019s plans for RWA going forward which are encouraging. However, until the role of the Cluster at the protocol is made clearer, we don\u2019t support this SPF request. Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Chainlink Automation (MIP63c4-SP5) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes I support this poll because Chainlink Automation provides a reliable, secure, and cost-efficient way to automate smart contracts.

Ratification Poll for Defense Fund (MIP55c3-SP14) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Abstain  This proposal to reimburse legal expenses for key stakeholders presents a potential conflict of interest, so we abstain from voting in support. We appreciate the work going into the proposal, but Maker needs to think through how to best respond to legal and regulatory actions. Ratification Poll for MIP63 Maker Keeper Network Amendment (MIP4c2-SP31) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes I support this proposal to improve MIP63 by more strictly defining how payments are sent and buffers reported, changing a few parameters, and adding an explicit stream duration.

Polls Adjust the Debt Floor (dust) - January 23, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Option 1 - Broad Reduction Value: Growth  I support a broad reduction of the barriers to entry, as it will help to increase and diversify our user base, which could subsequently lead to further growth as small clients grow into bigger clients or small clients refer their friends and family with greater assets. The level of dust reduction is still within a reasonable amount and will not cause commercially unviable vaults.

Polls PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - February 27, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  I support the proposed changes to the Stability Fee and Maximum Debt Ceiling in the poll. Raising the Stability Fee is a necessary measure to ensure the continued stability of the system. However, I would prefer for future stability fee increases to be avoided if possible. I also anticipate that short-term risk-free rates will reach 5% by mid-March, which could further reduce the demand for collateral vault loans. Therefore, I suggest that the DSR should be funded from collateral assets such as mip65, bonds, and MMFs, rather than from stability fee increases. ",

Additionally, it may reduce operational complexity and cost, which could be beneficial for businesses.  Increase the MIP65 (RWA007-A) Debt Ceiling - March 13, 2023 Voted: Yes By purchasing US Treasuries with maturities equally split over 6 months, Maker will be able to stabilize the system by having a reliable source of funding and net interest revenue. This will help reduce risks associated with the Maker Protocol and help ensure that it remains a secure and reliable source of funding and allow MakerDAO to increase the DSR which provides the protocol with stability (even though limited due to DAI in the DSR contract is redeemable instantly). Also, I would have preferred a MMF option, which would provide the same return but with daily liquidity, but given its not available o chain, this solution is sufficient.  Short Ratification Poll for Vault Setting Amendment Subproposal (MIP92c5-SP1) - March 13, 2023 Voted: No I appreciate the proposal and the efforts put into it, however, I think it is important to proceed with caution when introducing new strategies and investments to the Maker protocol, therefore I am declining this poll  Return Excess MIP65 Funds to Surplus Buffer - March 13, 2023 Voted: Yes I support sending the additional profits from these investments to the surplus. Besides responsibly increasing the size of the extra reserve, it is beneficial to assess the return competency and timing of such capital to the protocol. ",

Even though the proposed parameter changes are in the right direction, they are not enough to effectively diversify the stablecoin reserves. USDC still holds the majority of the reserve (7B cap vs 1b) and the proposed changes do not address the potential illiquidity of the smaller stablecoins. Additionally, PSM fees are applied for smaller illiquid stablecoins and without adding additional PSMs, the main risks remain in the US banking system via uninsured deposits. Therefore, I suggest voting to reject the proposal as it does not sufficiently address the main concerns.

We actively participates in governance on Uniswap, AAVE, Compound, dYdX and Optimism, and we are expanding our governance focus to more protocols. We are experienced in DeFi mechanism and protocol design and we are very interested in the Maker system. We believe that a fast-growing protocol needs a diverse team of delegates and continuous nourishment of the next generation of designers and developers. Blockchain at Berkeley is in a perfect position to supply talents from the student community to study the latest updates on Maker, and foster engagement to introduce learners to Maker. We want to provide student perspectives to analyze the Maker protocol in a non-partisan and forward-thinking manner, and we aim to make arguments with quantitative justifications on treasury, user experience, risk, etc. We have a track record of creating quality proposals and actively voting on Uniswap, Aave, etc. We created proposal about lowering the minimum proposing threshold on Compound to increase equity and inclusivity for proposal creation (Compound). For more about our justifications for past governance votes, please check our Twitter @CalBlockchain. Blockchain at Berkeley has departments including consulting for leading web3 projects, blockchain education on edX, blockchain accelerator program, and research. We dedicate at least one lead to each protocol and include all governance member to make decisions on all proposals. The governance department meets weekly to discuss the latest updates and presents analysis on proposals. We ensure voices of all members are considered before making a decision. The voting process within the department is democratic to balance knowledge from seasoned members and thoughts from younger members. Our governance initiatives include:  actively engaging in the governance forum to monitor latest protocol changes and risk management creating proposals when we believe an update in the protocol mechanism is needed to better serve Maker facilitating discussions when we find potential protocol risk or correlations risk with latest news testing proposals quantitatively to fact check and ensure proposal efficacy including more internal members to be engaged and learn about the Maker system and building with Maker  We appreciate your consideration for us to be your delegate. We believe that our experience and dedication will greatly compliment the Maker governance team. We are always happy to go in depth with our decision making and analysis so you can be assured that your delegation is efficient in the system.  Conflicts of Interest  We take part in governance of other major protocols including Uniswap, Aave, Compound, and Optimism.  I have read and agree to abide by the Delegate Code of Conduct.

The stablecoin vaults have shown potential risk to incur bad debt and it is a good time to clear out the risk.

We support a proactive take on tuning the parameters to ensure returns maximization and risk minimization. The Compound D3M will bring revenue as tested by Aave D3M and downplaying the inventory of MANA will manage the risk better. We will keep a close eye on the stability fees in the future as well.

The proposal can bring synergy between the two protocols to augment mutual benefits. The consistent development of Gnosis can bring more revenue. The stability fee is quite low given the current market conditions, but the 350% liquidation ratio and corresponding 13% liquidation penalty make up. Analysis from Oracle core unit shows risk in price manipulation due to the small volume of GNO. We will pay attention to this when the implementation is ready to be reviewed. Add BlockTower Credit Vault Types Vote: Abstain Reasoning: BlockTower has been a long-time partner with Maker but we are not confident with the previous history of investment efficiency. We have reviewed their MIP90 proposal and asked questions and received satisfying responses to our concerns. The deal is rather complicated and we are unsure that the risk profile the execution work well with the Maker ideologies. We want to have more information to make a decision and decide to abstain. Offboarding Parameters for renBTC Vote: Yes Reasoning: We support the prompt offboarding for renBTC given the current open information of potential insolvency of REN due to the FTX incident. The offboarding parameters look correct and we want to proceed the offboard sooner than later. Proceed with Pre-Implementation Work for the Deal Outlined in MIP90 (BlockTower Liquid AAA Structured Credit and Money Market Fund) - November 21, 2022 Vote: Yes Reasoning: We agree that it will be beneficial for the Strategic Finance core unit to analyze the deal with BlockTower as a due diligence to ensure the integrity of MIP90. As we are supporting MIP90, we want to see the result of further investigation. Ratification Poll for Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Facilitator Onboarding (MIP41c4-SP38) - November 14, 2022 Vote: No Reasoning: We don\u2019t see the clear need in Immunefi Security Core Unit to onboard another facilitator and as pointed out by the community, we think that the proposer should not submit the same proposal twice when it was failed.

First of all, we really appreciate the great work from the DUX unit and we love the Arbitrum polling option. We think the NewBear gives sustainable support to the team. Additional workload should be attributed project-wise, so additional hires or contractors should be signed project-by-project, instead of pre-approved in the budget ratification. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security (IS-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP83) - November 14, 2022 Vote: Abstain Reasoning: The main expense comes from bug bounties, which is 70+% of the total CU funding in both budget plans. This feels bizarre as we believe that MKR should have a bug bounty program but having a core unit purely serving to reward the whitehats does not feel efficient. We will abstain from the proposal and call for a better integration of the bug bounty in the ecosystem. Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Mandate (MIP39c2-SP38) - November 14, 2022 Vote: No Reasoning: We find the ratification not granting clear deliverables that are under the core unit\u2019s capacity. The bug bounty, incident responses and monitoring and advisory all aim to fill in gaps of various core units, so we suggest an integration of the Immunefi Core Unit with other units, or more creating more achievable and value-adding security service. The current ratification does not refine the existing mandate to add plausible value. Ratification Poll for OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) - November 14, 2022 Vote: No Reasoning: We are skeptical to the speculation of a token and its tokenomics to earn stable yield. OUSD has an average TVL that is 50% lower than the amount currently asked for. We find the risk level to be high with the practice of another native token and the governance token return model may be unnecessarily complicated with potential of governance tokens. We think that MakerDAO is well-qualified for the same capabilities without relying on another layer of decentralized protocol. We will urge the community to reject the proposal. Ratification Poll for CoinShares Active Treasury Management (MIP86) - November 14, 2022 Vote: Yes Reasoning: We find it important to have more choices of RWA management providers to distribute counter-party risk and test out the efficiency of the provider. The interest model of the treasury management is reasonable and we appreciate the clear custody and transparency measures of CoinShares. The team is experienced and the compliance measure is comparably comprehensive to other solutions. We find value in the future collaboration. Ratification Poll for Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit (MIP84c10-SP1) - November 14, 2022 Vote: Abstain Reasoning: We think we should pay extra caution when using the POVE and the recent surge in RWA exposure was not a part of consideration during the initial MIP84. However, given the risk and changes in the types of assets, we find tuning only the surplus buffer upper limit may be limiting to control the risk and it may introduce other risk dimensions to the POVE as mentioned by other members. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit DAI Budget, SAS-001 (MIP40c3-SP85) - November 14, 2022 Vote: Approve new bear budget Reasoning: We appreciate the work of the auctions UI to support smooth MKR liquidation, multi-channel liquidity, and decentralization. Given the current market condition, we believe that the new bear budget will provide a continuation of the service while being mindful of the constraints. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget, TECH-001 (MIP40c3-SP86) - November 14, 2022 Vote: Approve Reasoning: TechOps is a critical part of MKR operation, so we are approving its continuation in providing the necessary work. The scope of the core unit is clear so we don\u2019t expect additional funding for contractors or hires, so the current budget should be strictly the amount for the upcoming budget cycle. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Redwood Friesian (MIP88) - November 14, 2022 Vote: No Reasoning: We think the current ask amount of 245M is too high and risky for a provider who doesn\u2019t have experience working with decentralized protocols and structures. We are worried about decentralization and uncertainty about the RMBS program given the large amount. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Arrow Andalusian (MIP89) - November 14, 2022 Vote: Abstain Reasoning: We are interested in increasing the exposure to the ETF assets, but we are uncertain if Monetalis has the capacity to onboard the large capital amount. With that said, we appreciate Arrow Global\u2019s past experience, compliance, returns, and ESG missions. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit DAI Budget, SES-001 (MIP40c3-SP87) - November 14, 2022 Vote: Approve standard option budget Reasoning: We find value in the SES core unit\u2019s work in developing the endgame plan and more efficient DAO operation. We are unsure about the value output of the speedy operations, since the response of \u201cmore development power behind that project\u201d isn\u2019t substantial enough for the additional budget.

We think that increasing DSR is a clear choice, and we refer to  the FED rate hike step 0.75% as the benchmark. We want to make sure that the DSR adjustment will create a measurable impact, so we may be able to do further assessment. As a second choice, we have 0.5% as the conservative measure, which is voted above 0.75% by the club governance team. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - November 28, 2022 Vote: Yes Reasoning: We have reviewed the parameter changes for the vaults and approve the risk mitigating approach in fine tuning line and gap. We support the increase of line in stETH with the reduced gap and stability fees, and also the shift of focus in GUSD from USDP to increase return. We agree that no abrupt changes in stability fees will foster community recognition and good faith for maker. Undertake Necessary Risk and Legal Assessments to Increase the NS-DROP Debt Ceiling to 50 Million DAI - November 28, 2022 Vote: Yes Reasoning: We are interested to pursue an increase in the NS-DROP vault with New Silver in an effort to diversify RWA and earn interest. The current information about risk and treasury impact is limited, so we want to consult the analysis from strategic finance core unit to make any decision on the matter. ",

We decide to abstain to leave the decision to the more knowledgeable part of the community. Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit (SAS-001) Funding Request - December 12, 2022 Vote: Yes Reasoning: Given the funding rejection, it is great to see the new objective of the core unit to support endgame plan. We are a bit unsure about the deliverables and funding efficiency, but given the 4-month budget, we think it is worth to continue funding SAS and adjust the decision in four months given the outputs. Governance Communications Core Unit (COM-001) Funding Request - December 12, 2022 Vote: Yes Reasoning: We approve the wind-down spending of the GovComms core unit as it supports the proper offboarding efforts indicated by a previous proposal.

We would only support this type of shortfall once, and expect no such inconsistency should happen again. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - January 9, 2023 Vote: Yes Reasoning: We have reviewed the changes and we are in favor of the progressive risk exposure increase. We have implemented extreme caution in the parameters in the past month and given the continuing stability, we should promptly revert some of the changes and supply more liquidity in the market.

RISKDAO(aka @nonstopTheo) - YouTube  Delegates Code of Conduct: We as RiskDAO and its core contributors have read, acknowledge and adhere to Maker\u2019s Delegate Code of Conduct. (Agreed 28 September 2022).  Core Values   Rigorous risk frameworks: RiskDAO members think critically about risk factors and attack vectors of DeFi lending protocols. Among other things, we have developed a bad debt dashboard that sheds light into risk management practices of major lending protocols. We will apply this mindset to each and every discussion as a MakerDAO Delegate.  Hands on technical knowledge of the MakerDAO system: the RiskDAO consists of both risk analysts and smart contract developers. Some of the smart contract developers have deep understanding of the MakerDAO dss system, and previously spotted some flaws in the system.  Proactive approach: We think proactively, simulate and analyze potential bugs and exploit vectors before they arise. We don\u2019t want to be called in, when it\u2019s too late but rather point out potential issues before they arise. A recent example is the bug exposure for Moonwell cToken market.  Open source & Collaborative: We work in public and publish code and findings accordingly. We employ a highly collaborative approach with protocols and teams.  Diverse contributor base: We are an international community of contributors with a diverse skill set and have capabilities in smart contract programming, risk analyses, financial services and governance.  Accountability and responsibility: We are fully committed to serving the best interests and needs of MakerDAO, its tokenholders and community. We want to drive protocol growth, whilst minimizing risks to the protocol.  DeFi native: RiskDAO is set up specifically to make users more knowledgeable about how lending markets work, and the risk involved.   Delegate Statement We consider MakerDAO one of the most important DeFi primitives and actively want to shape its future direction. We are aware that protocol governance touches on numerous topics and consider ourselves perfectly suited to add substantial insights and benefits to public debate and decision-making processes. RiskDAO was created in May 2022 by DeFi protocol B.Protocol and by the research arm of 1kx, as the first DAO fully dedicated to creating open source risk management tools for DeFi. Recently, La Tribu, former contributing dev team of the Tribe DAO also started to contribute to the RiskDAO. We have grown rapidly as a DAO and are continuously delivering on our core values. This means we have seen an increase in projects & collaborations, onboarded contributors, published more research to generate insights into strong vs weak system designs.  Previous contribution to the MakerDAO ecosystem:  Tracking MakerDAO\u2019s bad debt in the Bad debt dashboard. B.Protocol team alerted about low dust levels for ETH-A collateral, and provided a detailed analysis, which consequently led to a decision to increase the dust level. B.Protocol\u2019s front end features an interface to the MakerDAO vault system. B.Protocol submitted a collateral on-boarding MIP with an implementation of an alternative liquidation mechanism for MakerDAO. The La Tribu dev team intensively worked on FEI<>DAI integration when it was contributing to the Tribe DAO. B.Protocol did a security audit for a MakerDAO\u2019s smart contract module. In his previous position in 2018, a team member of B.Protocol integrated Kyber Network DEX to aggregate Oasis DEX order book for DAI/ETH orders.   Other contributions to the DeFi ecosystem include:   Bad debt & ETH depegging dashboards Risk parametrization risk analysis for Vesta Finance Market price analysis for multi-layer DeFi scheme Liquidation events simulator Aurigami Dashboard Moonwell bug bounty Joint research with Myso Finance Vesta Finance risk simulation Bounty by Liquity for their Chicken Bonds: Create a methodology to ascertain fair value  RiskDAO focuses on protocol-specific risks, primarily to avoid bad debt. Given the increase in cross-chain activity, the risk framework has been broadened to account for risk vectors from cross-chain exposure. A description of our works is available on our website and blog.  Vision for MakerDAO RiskDAO is also going through the process of implementing DAO structures. This involves creating open source code & risk frameworks, community development and contributor onboarding. We are an agile organization that can adapt to MakerDAO\u2019s future: RiskDAO will be a highly valuable Delegate both in the existing state or if Maker transitions to the \u201cendgame\u201d structure.  Operational implementation RiskDAO\u2019s vote will be coordinated by nonstopTheo who also serves as your point of contact for any questions. We employ strict internal communication processes: All votes will be discussed internally first before published to the public forum.  Conflicts of Interest  The RiskDAO is giving risk assessment service to other lending markets and stablecoin platforms. B.Protocol has a pending MIP that will benefit B.Protocol. However, it is no longer actively pursued.   Disclosure This section discloses previous interactions between B.Protocol and Maker for full transparency, given that members of RiskDAO are contributors to B.Protocol. There are no conflicts of interests from these past actions.  One of B.Protocol\u2019s contributors set a precedent in 2020 by using a flash loan to influence a governance vote. The issue has been discussed at length and lessons have been learnt.  ",

                    "content": "Ratification Poll for Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set - October 10, 2022 Poll ID: 882 Vote YES\u2705 We are excited to support the transition to a more decentralized state as suggested by the Endgame proposal. We support the subproposals as they facilitate governance structures. We also support changes to the core unit mandates as part of the Endgame preparation & eventual transition. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Strategic Happiness Core Unit - SH-001 (MIP39c3-SP3) - October 10, 2022 Poll ID: 883 Vote YES\u2705 We support the offboarding of the strategic happiness core unit. We are believers in and advocates of fun & engagement around MakerDAO  but do not see the immediate benefit of the core unit to the DAO\u2019s operations. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Events Core Unit - EVENTS-001 (MIP39c3-SP4) - October 10, 2022 Poll ID: 884 Vote YES\u2705 We consider events incredibly relevant for crypto developer relations and community building. Real life events remain one of the most important platforms to reach developers and increase integrations with other protocols. However, as MakerDAO is moving towards the Endgame state, we understand there is less need for a standalone unit. Events will be handled in a separate organizational form going forward. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Real-World Finance Core Unit - RWF-001 (MIP39c3-SP5) - October 10, 2022 Poll ID: 885 Vote YES\u2705: The proposed action is required to prepare MakerDAO for the Endgame/MetaDAO transition. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding - RWF-001 (MIP41c5-SP12) - October 10, 2022 Poll ID: 890 Vote YES\u2705: There is no need for a dedicated facilitator if the RWF unit is offboarded. Ratification Poll for Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP81) - October 10, 2022 Poll ID: 886 Vote Yes\u2705 We acknowledge the opportunity to generate additional revenues in economically challenging times like these and thus support this proposal. Ratification Poll for Monetalis-Coinbase Appaloosa (MIP82) - October 10, 2022 Poll ID: 887 Vote Abstain We point out the lack of legal & technical clarity. We would require more information why Coinbase would pay 4.5%-6% with ETH/BTC as collateral, when current lending rates are much lower across DeFi. Coinbase has a non-investment grade issuer rating by Standard & Poors (BB) and their outstanding notes are trading well above 6% yields. Ratification Poll for Legal And Commercial Risk Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral BlockTower Credit - RWA Arranger SPF (MIP55c3-SP9) - October 10, 2022 Poll ID: 888 Vote YES\u2705 We acknowledge the need for proper legal reviews. In general, we would prefer to see fee scales so that work can be stopped if a certain roadblock is hit, before spending the entire cost budget. We would also prefer to see expected revenues from an onboarded client to put the fees in context. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding Process (MIP41c5) adjustments (MIP4c2-SP26) - October 10, 2022 Poll ID: 889 Vote YES\u2705 We support the streamlined process and faster implementation of Facilitator offoboarding.

We are also strongly in favor of the proposed parameter changes for Compound D3M given the underlying economics and pro-forma income potential. ",
