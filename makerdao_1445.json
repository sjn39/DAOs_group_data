The \u201cBankruptcy Law is Law\u201d counter-meme has some strengths. The \u201cCode is Law\u201d meme has an inherent weakness. As its inherent weakness, the \u201cCode is Law\u201d meme confidently mistakes code for law. Code is contracts, code is enforcement, but law is law. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code is exceptionally powerful and provides debtors and the bankruptcy court with tools to challenge the \u201cCode is Law\u201d meme. This post identifies one of those tools - the automatic stay. This posting only relates to the United States and no other jurisdiction and introduces some basic concepts. I will develop the analysis of this post in subsequent posts.  Automatic Stay The smart contract \u201cCode is Law\u201d meme is likely to find itself lined up for battle against the \u201cBankruptcy Law is Law\u201d counter-meme. Specifically, the battle will likely arise between the automatic liquidation mechanism in smart contracts and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code\u2019s \u201cautomatic stay\u201d provision. Section 362(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that the mere filing of a bankruptcy petition prohibits \u201cany act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of the property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate.\u201d Section 362(k)(1) provides a mechanism for the debtor to recover damages against any creditor that violates the automatic stay. Damages may include actual and punitive damages. For those not versed in bankruptcy terminology, \u201cestate\u201d is the debtor. Timing is Key Like most things in life, timing is everything. The automatic stay only applies to acts taken after the Chapter 11 filing. Chapter 11 is the process in which a debtor rehabilitates its business to emerge as a going concern. It does not automatically result in termination of the business.  1192\u00d7318 73.7 KB  Liquidation of Collateral A smart contract\u2019s liquidation of collateral pre-petition will not violate the automatic stay provisions. But, a smart contract\u2019s liquidation of collateral post-petition will likely violate the automatic stay provisions. Next In my next posting, I will explore whether a smart contract\u2019s liquidation of collateral constitutes an act for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code. After, I will examine whether a smart contract\u2019s liquidation of collateral constitutes a \u201cwilful act\u201d and thus support a claim for punitive damages. Finally, I will touch on how this all might apply to a DAO. ",

On a related note I have been wondering how much risk Maker would have to a Bitgo insolvency as Maker has ~170MM of wBTC in its vaults currently.  And Bitgo wraps and keeps the underlying BTC. A lender can have significant exposure to the bankruptcy of a borrower but this risk has structural mitigants:  In RWA investments, lenders often have the collateral of the borrower into a bankruptcy remote entity (SPV) that is not dragged into the borrowers bankruptcy process if done correctly ",

As hypo (thought experiment) I was wondering what happens if Party A gets USDC stolen by Thief A.  And Thief A sells to Party B (like Dai PSM) and then Party B and Party A both assert ownership and right to redeem the same USDC twice.  These thief arguments can probably get replaced with a \u201cfraudulent conveyance\u201d one. Obviously with all the God mode super powers in USDC it would not be a stretch for the BK Trustee to reach out to Circle and exert influence on calling these assets into a bankruptcy estate.

                    "content": "Submitted by @christiancdpetersen and @amskar Does a smart contract\u2019s liquidation of collateral constitute an act for purposes of Bankruptcy Code? As established in the previous post, a smart contract\u2019s liquidation of collateral pre-petition does not violate the automatic stay. However, a smart contract\u2019s automatic liquidation of collateral post-petition may violate the automatic stay. Section \u00a7 362(a)(3) of the US Bankruptcy Code prohibits \u201cany act to obtain possession of property of the estate \u2026 or to exercise control over property\u201d during the automatic stay. For a smart contract to violate the automatic stay, it must be considered an act that allows the creditor to take control or possession of the property. If a smart contract\u2019s immediate liquidation of collateral is an act, then the liquidation may violate the automatic stay. So what are the arguments?  No. Smart contracts are automatic and do not constitute \u201cacts\u201d. Smart contracts execute automatically without human enforcement. A smart contract\u2019s liquidation of collateral is not an act because the contract executes independent of any creditor action post-petition. Although the control of the property changes, the creditor is not actively taking steps to obtain control over the debtor\u2019s property. A creditor is not responsible if a smart contract liquidates collateral, because the creditor has not \u201cacted\u201d.  Yes. Possession and/or control of the property has changed. If a smart contract liquidates collateral post-petition, the creditor has assumed control and receives the benefits of the property. In the event of a Chapter 11 filing, the creditor must ensure that it does not assume control of the estate\u2019s property.  Yes. Technology is authorized by humans. The computers that execute smart contracts are agents of the humans who authorize them. The creditor is responsible for the smart contract because it is responsible for the technology that executes it. The act of liquidation is actually planned. In the U.S., the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act defines an \u201celectronic agent\u201d as a computer program that can initiate an action without review or action by an individual.  Yes. The creation of a smart contract is an act itself. It is an act to create, authorize, and consent to a smart contract that may eventually violate the automatic stay. The creation of the smart contract itself might constitute an act under the Bankruptcy Code.  The Bankruptcy Code has not yet dealt with the implications of second-generation Blockchain-based smart contracts. And from the above, there can be arguments on both sides of a particular issue \u2013 what is an \u201cact\u201d?  Introduction \u2013 @amskar is university student who expressed interest in both law and DeFi. She is interning with me over the summer and I am giving her exposure to some of the pending transactions and having her research various legal/DeFi topics. ",

The question was among the \u201clegal issues critical to the outcome of the case\u201d   \u201cWe\u2019re in an area where the law is quite uncertain and quite at odds with the market\u2019s general expectations,\u201d said Brandon Hammer, a bankruptcy lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb. Many in crypto markets have wrongly assumed that simply taking possession of crypto pledged as collateral will protect their position as a secured lender under bankruptcy law, Hammer said. In fact, they could still be forced to return the assets, leaving them only with an unsecured claim equal to the value of the loan.   \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s going to be examined is whether or not Tether was fully secured. Did Tether properly perfect its security in its collateral?\u201d said Tad Davidson, co-head of the bankruptcy practice at Hunton Andrews Kurth.   \u201cThe way you perfect security over bitcoin hasn\u2019t been tested in any kind of litigation,\u201d said Jonathan Cho, a bankruptcy lawyer at Allen & Overy. The uncertainty was heightened when El Salvador declared bitcoin legal tender last year. The Uniform Commercial Code, rules followed by almost all US states, labels mediums of exchange recognised by foreign governments as physical money over which security can only be perfected by physical possession \u2014 a problem for digital currency.   The UCC was updated this month to include specific rules on crypto security that focuses on control of the asset. But the rules are not yet law and are not retrospective. Current best practice in crypto markets has involved issuing public documents known as UCC filings that declare a security interest in intangible assets, or applying rules on investment assets that involve a third-party custodian taking control of the asset, lawyers said.

While a keeper may certainly automate parts of this process, my understanding is that they would typically operate a node and monitor and make bidding decision off-chain, since on chain processing would be prohibitively expensive in terms of gas. Under this flow, it seems much more clear that the Keepers have both the mens rea and actus reus to be in violation of the automatic stay, and I would think that the trustees would try mightily to get jx over them to claw back any liquidated assets.  @jameskmccall is absolutely correct that this could lead to some bad game theory implications for bystanders in the DAO when it comes to liquidators that believe themselves to be outside the jurisdictional reach of the bankruptcy court.
