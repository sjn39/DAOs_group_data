The Index is entirely governed by the community (token set, weights, internal fees). Also, the index will use all pooled tokens for votings in composite protocols (we call it meta-governance) and for the Vault strategies as well. All profits will be distributed to the holders of the index token, representing the basket of assets inside the index. We are notifying that we will distribute 1% of TTS to the community of every protocol, which will be approved by our community. It is done for one purpose - provide your community governance rights to manage the index (together with other protocols from the index). More info about all this stuff is here. Have a nice day and feel free to ask questions if there are any. Best regards, The PowerPool team ",

For example, Protocol Politicians from AAVE should be elected by the AAVE community   I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be doing this. Community bandwidth is limited, and I\u2019m not sure why Maker Governance should spend time on figuring out where PowerPool should direct grant money when the purpose of Maker Governance is to govern the Maker Protocol. If any individuals here are interested, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get in touch with you. Alternatively, find individuals in the PowerPool community with an interest in Maker, and award the grants to them.     PowerPool:  This grant will be divided into two parts: the main one (900k CVP) will be under control of the MakerDAO community   MakerDAO doesn\u2019t currently have the apparatus to receive and control arbitrary ERC20 tokens. It\u2019s also unclear to me as to what the purpose of the 900k grant is.     PowerPool:  All pooled tokens can be used for fund management strategies.   What exactly does this involve?  I appreciate that you\u2019re trying to build the community around PowerPool, but coming to other DeFi communities and offering grant money contingent on a greater integration with your community and product seems a little sketchy to me.

                    "content": "First of all, hi. I am head of research from PowerPool. Nice to meet you here! Our team appreciates your critics.  We understand that MakerDAO governance isn\u2019t about interactions with other projects. But, due to Defi composability, the proxy-governance (or the meta-governance) concept is on developing. It means that soon different projects, accumulating (for any reason) MKR tokens inside their liquidity pools would be able to build an option to use these pooled tokens for voting in MakerDAO governance. Of course, you can ignore that, but once pooled liquidity will be significant, it can influence your votings.  We know that the majority of decisions in Maker is done by big bag holders (investors, whales, etc), so probably these pooled tokens wouldn\u2019t be able to influence votings significantly, but let\u2019s see. Here I just want to point out the fact that MakerDAO governance would interact with other protocols with 100% guarantee, according to the fact that these protocols will interact with MakerDAO\u2019s governance anyway:)   We offered this grant as MKR probably would be index participant and therefore these tokens (locked for some time but with the ability to use voting power) can be used by MKR community to have an influence on index management. We just decided that as the index is entirely governed by the community, the community of each protocol from the index should have the opportunity to change something without buying tokens. If you don\u2019t want to participate, we appreciate it.   Fund management strategies involve using pooled tokens for some activity, which generates cashflows distributed to the index token holders. For example, YFI is used in governance and earned rewards are distributed, AAVE will be used in AAVE staking, SNX for minting synthetic assets, and deriving profits from that. For the MKR we don\u2019t have a clear and (what is most important) 100% safe strategy. It is the reason why we didn\u2019t provide it in this post.   Yes, we are building community (btw we already have it, and it is pretty active). But, as we providing value to each protocol that would be inside the index, we decided to post it and attract more people to the index. It\u2019s fair if you don\u2019t accept that, it is your forum.   Thank you for your feedback, we would change this post to a tiny version and cut off all the stuff regarding Powerpool itself. Thank you for your attention and time, probably our community should vote in another protocol to be index participant. ",
