                    "content": "I believe that the process leading to the Istanbul Network Upgrade process has highlighted a tradeoff between ensuring the success of Ethereum 1.x and properly considering all of the EIPs proposed by the Ethereum community. Even without the 1.x initiatives, Istanbul has more proposed EIPs than any previous Ethereum network upgrade (see this). A significant of the time on the AllCoreDevs calls leading up to both the EIPs submission deadline (May 17th) and client implementation deadline (July 19th ) has been spent discussing these.   eips1582\u00d7420 58 KB    Picture from the tweet linked above, showing how big Istanbul (top row) would be relative to previous network upgrades if all proposed EIPs got accepted.  This has the consequence that many of the 1.x initiatives have gotten very little attention in the process and that, as of now, not a single \u201c1.x EIP\u201d has been moved to Accepted for the Istanbul upgrade. This has led to some frustration about the process, as expressed during the last AllCoreDevs call:   twitter.com    Tim Beiko | timbeiko.eth (TimBeiko)  Alexey points out that Istanbul became a focal point for everything that people want to change in Ethereum, versus a \"emergency\" update to the growing state size problem. Adds that because of this, it may not be possible to ship State Rent upgrades as quickly. Tim Beiko | timbeiko.eth @TimBeikoThere have been some conversations about working with @whiteblock on this, but given that it's a SaSS platform, there are some incentive alignment issues with the @ethereum foundation. @hudsonjameson says that there have been talks about using it by the EF.    12:09 AM - 5 Jul 2019     1            While some of the 1.x initiatives require more work and may not be ready for Istanbul anyways, if nothing in the process changes, we run the risk of arriving at the next network upgrade (April 2020?) and again having a large number of \u201ccommunity EIPs\u201d compared to the amount of \u201c1.x EIPs\u201d. At the same time, it seems that our current process has also done a poor job of addressing several of these \u201ccommunity EIPs\u201d such as ProgPow, EIP-615, etc., leaving the community members for these initiatives feeling disenfranchised. While these EIPs offer genuine improvements, they are not on the \u201c1.x critical path\u201d and require a significant resource commitment from EIPs champions, core developers, EIP editors, etc. There is thus a tradeoff between the time and attention spent on these vs. the 1.x initiatives. Judging by how satisfied both sides are with the current process, we have so far handled it poorly. There are a few proposals about how we may move things forward, and I think we should discuss them in more details here.  1. @AlexeyAkhunov\u2019s  \u201cEthereum 1.x As An Attempt To Change The Process\u201d  Based on this framework, if non-1.x initiatives become more \u201c1.x-ey\u201d and form working groups to move their projects further along before formalizing them into EIPs, they may have a better shot at succeeding, while removing some of the \u201ctop of the funnel\u201d burden on EIP editors and core developers. To some extent, ProgPow seems to have done this.  2. Explicit guidelines about what EIPs should be prioritized. While this is obviously controversial (i.e. Who sets the guidelines? To optimize what? When/how do we change them?), it may be worth trying to prioritize EIPs which are on the 1.x critical path or that are simple to implement and provide high ROI (i.e. chain ID opcode, BLAKE2b precompile, etc.), a.k.a. \u201cquick wins\u201d. The obvious risk here is that we disenfranchise community members who have EIP proposals that don\u2019t fall in this bucket.  3. \u201c1.x-only\u201d Network Upgrades A less radical alternative to #2 may be to have network upgrades that are exclusive to 1.x initiatives as well as \u201copen\u201d network upgrades, which would be open the equivalent of our current process. Again, once caveat being that defining what is OK for these 1.x upgrades would be contentious. There has been some push to have more frequent network upgrades (see here) as well as a push for a more regular upgrade cadence (see EIP-1872). For example, with a 3 month cadence, you could have \u201copen\u201d upgrades more or less as frequently as today, with an additional \u201c1.x\u201d upgrade every 3 months. It could also be possible for 1.x EIPs to be included in the \u201copen\u201d upgrades. The biggest concerns against such frequent upgrades was the time it takes to understand, implement and test EIPs. Given that most 1.x initiatives are well known and that a fair bit of the work happens in working groups, these would be somewhat mitigated.  Neither of these options feels perfect at the moment, but I believe it\u2019s worth kickstarting a discussion about how we can make rapid progress on the 1.x initiative, keep non 1.x contributors as part of the community and reduce the burden on core developers\u2026 which we can think of as the \u201cEIPs Scalability Trilemma\u201d  ",

I agree this is probably not the right approach, though.     boris:  (3) I think the process could use improvement and that\u2019s where the stall is.

I agree with the first sentence, but IMO a lot of the pushback that we have seen on EIPs isn\u2019t a clear written objection as much as \u201cthis seems complicated, the benefits are unclear (a.k.a. it\u2019s not on the critical path, and there are risks\u201d.

It\u2019s often not that anyone opposes an idea, but more that properly analyzing, discussing, testing, etc.-ing it has a high opportunity cost. I think Alexey\u2019s post that I link above addresses this to some extent: if EIPs arrive in a \u201cfinal\u201d stage you both 1. weed out some of them and 2. have higher quality proposals for people to review.     boris:  If Community EIPs can\u2019t get through (let\u2019s ignore the funding part for the moment) then governance is already captured by the people at the EF who work on this full time.
