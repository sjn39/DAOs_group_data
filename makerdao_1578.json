                    "content": "Introduction Due to Tornado Cash sanctions, recently there\u2019s been increased discussion about the urgency to move away from USDC collateral. The most direct way MakerDAO has to incentivize borrowing using crypto collateral is by lowering stability fees. This is a superpower for Maker because it can undercut the competition and make borrowing attractive \u2013 and generally, this hasn\u2019t been used enough as a tool for growth. Proposal idea Today, the relevant stability fees are listed below (by total supply) and in total generate  $15.4 million in stability fees annually:  ETH-C: 0.5%. WBTC-A: 2.25%. ETH-A: 2.25%. stETH-B: 0.75%. stETH-A: 2.5%. ETH-B: 4.0% WBTC-C: 0.75% WBTC-B: 4.0%.  My idea is that a subset of these would temporarily be set at 0%. This would push to the maximum the incentive MakerDAO has to promote these vaults and is a good test run in undercutting market rates. The goal would be to see some significant progress with regard to lowering the reliance on USDC. An alternative that could be discussed (needing input from the Risk CU) is lowering the liquidation ratios. A combination of lower liquidation ratios and 0% stability fees would be the most aggressive strategy. Concerns and replies Negative impact on protocol revenue:  Maker has ~80 million DAI in the surplus buffer, which is adequate runway for operations. Stability fees can always be raised if the tradeoff isn\u2019t worth it. This makes it more important to bring in revenue from USTs to offset losses. Note, Maker\u2019s unique value proposition is making it cheap to borrow \u2013 we should use this.  Unclear impact on borrowing interest:  If there\u2019s an estimate/experience from previous experiences here, would be interested in hearing. In preliminary discussions, I\u2019ve run into some skepticism on if this would have a material impact. In 2020, this has been tried with muted impact. It\u2019s likely the market has changed since quite a bit since and there would be players jumping to get in at lower rates.  Next steps Open to feedback and suggestions. If there\u2019s interest in the community, will start putting together a more formal proposal. ",

Other ideas to foster vault usage are listed below:  For new vualts: 0 SF and a one time mint fee (0.5 to 2%) For existing and new vaults: Reduced SF pricing for borrowed balances above XM (above certain threshold)  For the existing vaults, how would this proposal reduce the 3bn+ in the PSM USDC? I understand that the Collateral backing DAI would diversify but we dont know by how much vault usage would increase. It would be a 15M test that we might not be able to afford. Another option to reduce exposure and build the SB could be to add PSM fees when PSM balances exceed a certain percentage of DAI backing? My opinion:  In an ideal world this should be 10-25% but realistically today given the situation around 50%. ",

Data as of 6/6 This is the WBTC Maker Rate premium, as defined by the WBTC-A SF subtracted by the USDC borrow rate on AAVE V2, plotted alongside the Maker market share of stablecoins drawn against WBTC. WBTC-A directional rate changes are overlaid. The primary insight I gleaned from this is from the two rate drops mid 2021 and the subsequent 2 rate hikes toward the end of 2021: in both cases, it seemingly took the market months to react. So I\u2019m afraid a trial that lasts a week or 2 would do nothing besides burn revenue for those weeks. Further, for WBTC and ETH vaults, we have about 45% market share (as defined by share of stablecoins drawn against those collaterals). If we vampired the entire market (not gonna happen), it would only ~double our crypto-backed DAI, so this move would likely only put a relatively small dent in our USDC dependence. And as soon as we turned SFs back on, the customers that moved over would likely leave (after ~3 months, of course haha). Realistically, I think the approach we should take to reducing USDC dependence is 2-fold:  Onboard a more diverse class of RWAs, including bonds. This plan is in motion but obviously stalled in the recent drama. Potentially swap out some PSM USDC for decentralized stablecoins (sUSD, LUSD if the price is right, etc), even if temporarily.  As always, my opinion. ",
