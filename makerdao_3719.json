Negative interest rates (on demand deposits) means that people are literally being charged a % fee to hold their money at a bank. Based on my understanding of the current MCD system there is no way to mimic this with Dai. It is not possible to implement a negative DSR as currently implemented due to voluntary DSR participation/lock-up. If rates were to go negative, how would Maker prevent Dia from trading at a premium? On the supply side, the goal would be to increase supply by reducing the stability fee but that can\u2019t go lower than 0 (I assume because otherwise MKR holders would be eating the difference which would be unsustainable). On the demand side, the stability fee can\u2019t be lowered below 0(because it\u2019s opt in option). What options are left to maintain the peg in a scenario where the stability fee is 0, the DSR is 0 but Dai is still trading at a premium? ",

If it came down to this I would be advocating highly to adopt a commodity peg either energy or PMs or both since I don\u2019t ever see negative rates entering those markets - just straight up inflation due to excessive money printing and currency devaluation that will ensue by CBs.    This whole idea of NIRP is rather insane and dangerous to the world economy to my mind.   imo it is my hope Maker should try to do better and avoid going down this road even if it means changing what we are trying to PEG to.

I think the simplified answer to this is that in such an environment, assets prices should rise, including ETH, real estate, metals, etc. The demand for leverage should rise as well, including in Maker, so vault openings and the dai supply should eventually rise, lowering the dai price. Raised debt ceilings can further facilitate this. ",

If true, this is a problem that needs to be solved. TRFM would be one option. Other options would be to make the DSR compulsory with the ability to set to negative. A third option would be for the DAO to mint Dai and sell into the market to increase supply. Not sure that I\u2019ve thought this third option the whole way through, but this may be the best option. It allows Dai holders to avoid negative interest rates and MKR holders to reap the benefits of the printed Dai sales. If the system could reliably and sustainably provide a zero/non-negative return to Dai holders in a negative rate environment this would be huge. I would expect explosive growth of the system. It could/should be done now for the currencies currently experiencing negative savings rates. ",

                    "content": "(This post is a transfer of conversation from the Onboarding USDC as collateral to mitigate liquidity risk topic.)    Onboarding USDC as collateral to mitigate liquidity risk   The assumption you are making is true over the long term, but there can be periods of time (like during a drawn-out pandemic or a massive catastrophe) when economic activity shrinks. DAI needs to be able to handle these situations. A temporary negative fee and DSR would be a very effective fix. Beats an emergency shutdown!   I agree, on the short term from now, a negative DSR can be better than an ES. However, you previously talked about longer-term changes, and that\u2019s also what I\u2019m addressing. (To make it clear, I\u2019m talking about the negative DSR in the next two paragraphs.) I still think that negative interest rates make \u201csense\u201d only in the ethically compromised world of legacy finance. Although Maker still depends on it (e.g. Dai is pegged to a fiat currency), Maker\u2019s goal should be to create a system that evolves beyond legacy concepts and ethics.  And if that means e.g. a surplus buffer of 25% of the Dai supply as a recession war chest, or flopping every week in times of crisis, then maybe that\u2019s the price to pay for a better system. My point is that it\u2019s easy to fall into copying the legacy system and make the same mistakes. And it\u2019s tenfold easier under the duress of a crisis. Dai users shouldn\u2019t pay for the faults of economists and policy makers from past generations. They are the prime user base of Maker. The whole purpose of this initiative relies on them.    Onboarding USDC as collateral to mitigate liquidity risk   Of course, once the surplus is depleted, the situation goes back to normal and the Stability Fee can go back to being positive again. In normal times, economic activity is expanding, demand for DAI and ETH is increasing and the Stability Fee and DSR are positive. But in an emergency, they can go negative until normality is restored. People would understand that a negative fee is only temporary and preserves their investments, unlike an ES.   As long as it\u2019s within the confines of a positive surplus, and it\u2019s effective, I\u2019m not against a negative SF. I\u2019d have to think more about it. It would be basically a distribution of (part of the) surplus buffer to vault owners.    Onboarding USDC as collateral to mitigate liquidity risk   This is an incomplete fix. An ES is a risk that stays in the back of people\u2019s minds, undermining their confidence in DAI and ETH. It needs to be reduced as much as possible.   The ES is always a risk. It\u2019s the risk you take when you enter the system, and one you have to take care of first. Trust in Maker relies on the base assumption that during an ES, every system participant is more-or-less fairly remunerated. Once that\u2019s taken care of, you can go on to deal with other things, like people\u2019s perception of how likely an ES is and such. ",

                    "content": "@chaser  Thank you for your reply. You echo my sentiments and understanding of the NIRP environment quite well.   I agree asset prices typically will rise (that was and has been managed by CBs as well using futures markets to great extent particularly during the 2007-8 crisis and associated money creation to \u2018support\u2019 asset prices over the past decade - the US CB I think still has not unwound its treasury exposure completely to the 2007-2008 event).  You are also right demand for leverage naturally would rise (and has).   What is interesting is you conclude with a point I get back to repeatedly.   Liquidity (via raised debt ceilings) would most facilitate management of the PEG particularly when demand is high.  One just has to be careful that the facilitated liquidity is not allowed to run away by continuously increasing debt ceilings.  Usually in this case the PEG is running <1. My concern is the risk management under such schemes.  CBs pretty much are running amok in this realm as far as I can tell.  I really like the idea (but know there are people who completely disagree with me - mostly kensians) of not allowing rampant money printing and a complete leverage up, who gives a shit about risk laze faire attitude vs. a more conservative well if the markets need some pain to slow down, let it happen approach.  It is my view better to hold back growth to moderate risk and allow some cracks/liquidations to appear and/or slow markets down than to just let them run rampant and then self collapse in a massive risk off event.   What we have seen is for the tendancy of humans with markets to allow the creation of massive risk dependency and having not enough backing capital for liquidity to manage the deleveraging of risk.    This approach inherently puts a damper on \u2018return\u2019 - giving up some return to buy insurance against risk and always tend to slow down economies vs. to heat them up constantly.   Conceptually I feel it is better to limit growth in exchange for lower and managable risk exposure to try to lengthen the inevitable end of the business growth cycle. I never posted this but this whole tread is rather preescient of the events recently. Interesting idea to pay vault owners to borrow.  But if the whole liquidation system puts peoples capital at risk you can pay all you want and they simply are NOT going to borrow more.   Typically CBs basically are just going to print because they have no compunction about backing for capital. In the Maker system there really is no similar mechanic for providing liquidity to the system via unbacked printing.  Sopping up that liquidity via fees is the obvious back out btw\u2026  One could argue that Maker could via USDC basically drop the USDC SF to near 0 and alter the Liquidation Ratio down to allow for high leverage.  IF Maker knew that there was absolute 0 chance of a blacklisting event one could pretty much use this as a direct tool for decentralized printing via USDC backing but this simply increases general reluctance to want to use DAI if basically in a ES DAI resolves to a large portion of USDC which the community in general affects confidence as you say. I don\u2019t see an obvious mechanism (negative rates will just pull drom DSR) - paying borrowers to borrow IS an option but then when sopping up this DAI via fees you actually then have to burn the amount you paid them to pull it back properly and retain collateralization in an ES.   Remember if you just pay borrowers DAI you are in effect increasing DAI supply but not increasing collateral.  During an ES one would need to account for this extra money printing by lowering the effective redemption rate on DAI to collateral to something less than $1 again affecting DAI holders. Interesting thing here.  Everytime I look at the ES it looks to me like DAI holders end up holding the bag as I know of no real mechanism in the system to guarantee they will be made whole while if the backing collateral value rises > $1 DAI holders end up making money.

Both could be employed in parallel for safeguards.   One of the few first things I asked about here (can\u2019t remember if it was chat or forums) was about why the Surplus was so low at .5M.  Everyone was like - we just picked that number.  I was like - I think you should raise it to something closer to 2-3M at least.  SImple reasoning suggested you would be paying 2x DAI buring MKR than you would minting MKR to buy DAI (which is burned effectively btw - completely sopping up liquidity when you had a negative surplus event). I still think it should be minimum 2-3% total DC for a whole bunch of reasons and think in reality it would be better at 5M or higher (has to start including costs of operation which will be wayyy north of 1-2M/yr).   So in principle I agree with you surplus needs to be higher to deal with your case (2) safetynet. With regards to your (1) DC management to anticipate frothy markets to preanticipate bust by slowing down the runoff tops.   I believe better data and market effectiveness would be served with     Proposal interest rate adjustment by debt facility utilization Risk       I am posting this as a new topic for discussion because after the first round of analysis and the fact the GSM time delay is not activated means the IAMs that could be used to implement it could be coming on line shortly.   Also my wife is now suffering a debilitating medical condition that requires almost constant care currently and so it is time I hand various details/ideas I have found off to others for discussion and debate.  I don\u2019t want to talk about implementation issues but simply the me\u2026     The beauty of this kind of automated rate/facilityutilization curve generation is that it allows for incremental DC SF rate changes at the ends of utilization - if the market is getting heated it will show by where the utilization is sitting on the curve.  If way underutilized it will be at the bottom of the curve.  You can use that info to adjust base rate policy or DC limits and basically let the market tell you what it is thinking and then decide whether to let the growth run, or reign it back a bit.   Literally in such a model if the usage curves are not within expected bounds (20-80%) you will see how disjointed they are getting by how far off into rate increase or decrease they are driving you to go.   The bonus of this model is that you basically capture the higher rates automatically and relieve governance from having to act all the time over shooting, undershooting, whatever and if no-one wants money rates automatically due to low utilization rates drop significantly as well (probably the rarer case).

Paying the negative ES to vault owners could work the same way, only in an automatic manner.   This was why I was saying during last \u2018deficit\u2019 the system continued to run fine with -5.3M debt and flops halted.  That fact alone should have been sufficient to drive the PEG to below 1 (ES the system there and DAI holders take a haircut to the tune of ~6-7% below $1 at the time from 1.08 or above it was like a 13% price swing) but it didn\u2019t (markets ignored the fact their collateral was worth 6-7% under $1 for a few days and instead DAI only dropped to maybe 1.03).   While I like the idea of paying that interest to vault owners - would it really make it into markets to drive the PEG down.  I think they would just use it to pay down debt and lower their Liquidation price.  Those people would basically bank it against future fees vs. borrowing more.  Now would new ETH come in to deposit and mint as well as make some return in a 0 rate enviroment - yeah.   Guess what they have to do - to do that.   Buy collateral.  If they want to lever it.  They sell DAI and buy more collateral.   But the amount of liquidity that comes on the market I think has an impairment factor related to newETH /oldETH factor.  So if you want to double system liquidity you basically need newETH=oldETH.   What I find interesting is to create like extra 1K DAI the system only has to offer to pay some small percent/yr to (all vault holders including the new ones) to encourage that so whilie there is an impairment factor related to amount of DAI that can be generated by newETH - there is a multiplier factor on how much DAI interest has to paid to generate that 1K DAI for X time for new vault owners (or bankers on the borrowing side of DAI) I will have to think more about this one but honestly the more I think about it the more I like it as a real decentralized negative rate enviroment.  Because the negative rate is taking the positive rate to the borrowers to encourage more borrowing.   As long as there isn\u2019t other postive returns out there to compete with your positive rate for vault/borrowing in the collateral side I think this should prove a quite effective way to generate DAI liquidity that would be freely unleashed on the markets.   Then just sop it up with +SF later.   The only issue is how one treats the negative balance during a ES and determining when a negative balance requires minting and selling MKR in flops vs. just sopping up with +SF later which is what is done now. What this tells me is that instead of punishing savers with negative interest rates, we should be paying borrowers to borrow.   BUt hell in their CB world everything is levered to the hilt but literally it would be paying the borrowers to borrow to induce new borrowing while rewarding everyone that is in the hole, at the expense of savers (in terms of inflation).     When I compare this to what is going on now, what we have is socialized money printing, direct injection into the entire economy - literally like a crypto air drop of cash throughout the economy at the expense of tax payers/savers.  Though if you look at how government portioned this out - biggest amounts go to businesses that will be deepest in the hole.   Literally consider if the FED just started paying people to have mortgage debt, car debt, whatever debt and a cash savings rate of 0.  Only way to earn 1% is to borrow.  Whether you spend it or not is up to you.    Wow.  Wouldn\u2019t that be a different world! ",
