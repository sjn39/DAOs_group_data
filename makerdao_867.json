                    "content": " Request to Poll for Maker Wormhole Deployment and Associated Risk Parameters In support of MIP69: L2 to L1 Fast Withdrawals, Protocol Engineering is requesting to poll on the following parameters as part of the weekly governance cycle, which if successful will allow this to proceed to an on-chain vote. The reason for introducing this poll while the MIP is still in RFC is that the technical work has been underway for sometime and is known by the community but requires a formal poll to proceed with the defined risk parameters. Completing this formality now will enable Maker to vote on the deployment once it is ready, for which we are targeting mid-April.  Parameter Summary Protocol Engineering is requesting Governance to poll on approving L2 to L1 Fast Withdrawals, including: Approve the following gateways (domains), as documented in MIP69 and the github implementation:  Optimism Arbitrum  Debt Ceiling Parameters:  Set the Optimism Debt Ceiling parameter to 1M Dai Set the Arbitrum Debt Ceiling parameter to 1M Dai Set the Global Debt Ceiling to 2M Dai - as a sum of all debt ceilings for each domain.  Wormhole Fee Parameters per Domain:  Set the Arbitrum Wormhole Fee parameter to 0 Set the Optimism Wormhole Fee parameter to 0  Approve Oracle Quorum of (13) feeds  This is the minimum number of feed attestations required to complete a Fast Withdrawal transaction and will be comprised of any of the 25 oracle feeds provided by the Oracles team.   Details:  A conservative 1M Dai debt ceiling for both domains has been applied. This has been chosen to limit Fast Withdrawal risk and will be considered for increase once the Wormhole has been upgraded to support oracle hard confirmations and the market has shown demand for greater usage. The current implementation is based on oracle soft confirmations requiring complete trust in the sequencer to include confirmed transactions that burn DAI. The wormhole fee is an absolute amount and is levied per domain. This could be upgraded in the future if the need arises. This fee is only applied to fast withdrawals. The slow withdrawals bridge, which requires a 7 day wait will continue to function without fees even if fees are introduced for Fast Withdrawals.  ",

Even with a relatively small debt ceiling like proposed, a quorum as small as 3 or 5 present a certain level of risk that I\u2019m not comfortable with. For reference, for the MCD price oracles, we use a quorum of 13, and we still use the Oracle Security Module to protect from oracle attacks. Overall our oracle feeds have a long history of reliability and honesty (some have been with us for 5 years), but we need to be extremely careful when giving more trust to a small subset of that group.
