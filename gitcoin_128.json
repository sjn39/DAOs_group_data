                    "content": "Hey folks! KlimaDAO has been working with us for a while to help us estimate our carbon emissions . The working doc can be found here From the report by Klima there are two main numbers to focus on: 715 tCO2e - Our total carbon impact from the trading of GTC at the date of the report 1352 tCO2e - Our total carbon impact from the running of Gitcoin Grants (donations and payouts inclusive) These emissions represent our total on-chain emissions to date, representing all trading of GTC, all donations made during our grants rounds, and our grants payouts across Mainnet, zksync and polygon. Note: these do not address Bounties, Hackathons, Kudos, or any other on-chain emissions we may have produced to date.  Proposal for a carbon-neutral policy at Gitcoin I am proposing that we do two things: Ratify the intention to become fully carbon-neutral at Gitcoin DAO, and implement Phase 1 of a carbon-neutral policy In Phase 1, I propose we fully offset our on-chain energy usage for our Grants program and GTC token to date, and to agree to continue to offset our energy consumption for grants and GTC going forward. out of scope for this proposal. In a Phase 2 to be described in more detail pending completion of Phase 1, I believe we could pursue full carbon neutrality by reducing and offsetting our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. This would require that we consider our total operational emissions, and the emissions of our products. These emissions would include all sources of greenhouse emissions we produce in the operation of our DAO, including the energy consumption from our other on-chain activities such as governance, treasury actions and contributor disbursements, usage of AWS or other SaaS products, air travel and resources consumed for our conferences and events, the emissions from producing and shipping swag, and potentially others. The effort to build a holistic emissions reduction and offsetting strategy would mostly likely require us to engage an outside group for consultation, the specifics of implementing this phase would require additional time and resources that are out of scope for this proposal.  What needs to be decided to complete our offsetting  1. Choose your Token We have several options for tokenized carbon credits available to us at this time. Prices as of 5 June 2022 Standard Offsets: BCT - Toucan\u2019s Base Carbon Ton $2.01 UBO - C3 Universal Base Offset $2.78 Nature based Offsets: NCT - Toucan\u2019s Nature Carbon Ton $4.52 MCO2 - Moss\u2019s Nature-based Carbon Ton $5.81 NBO - C3 Nature Based Offset $4.08 There\u2019s been some controversy about BCT and while these are Verra standard offsets many have critcized these as virtually worthless: Bloomberg - Are you a robot? But we would be able to cherry-pick particular projects from the BCT pool, this is in some ways a benefit to help the market find the true price of the BCT pool, and would allow us to offset with credits that come from some potentially worthwhile projects. Furthermore there have been some recent actions taken by Verra (their statement here) that have disrupted the tokenization of carbon credits (see Kilma\u2019s response here, and Toucan\u2019s response here). It\u2019s still unclear what implications this has for web3 carbon projects, and for the moment Toucan is asking it\u2019s community to pause bridging Verra credits on chain). For this offset, we could decide to avoid Verra credits altogether, and opt to offset via Redd+ projects only for this first initial offsetting program. We should also note that we have already had some offsetting done on our behalf by our friends at Toucan, and some carbon credits in our treasury with an early gift from Toucan: https://twitter.com/ToucanProtocol/status/1501520217100283912 This was a gift of 152 NCT burned on our behalf, as well as 54 tons deposited for us to use in the future: Polygon Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | PolygonScan \u2026and a nice NFT to commemorate: Ethereum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Etherscan So for our total footprint for GTC trading and the Grants rounds of 2068 tCO2e, less the amount already offset and in the treasury, we have 1862 tons to purchase. If we do this with NCT our offset for Phase 1 will cost $4.52 * 1862 = $8416.24 I would welcome discussion on this approach, and if we believe we should choose a different mix of tokens, offset GTC separately from the Grants program emissions, or any other approaches the community might recommend.  2. Burn your Tokens Once we have purchased the tokenized carbon credits, all that remains to complete our offsetting is to burn those tokens.  3. Proof of Offsetting The beauty of doing this on-chain is the full history of the burning, purchase, and original tokenization is traceable back to the carbon credit, and the proof is all available on-chain. But we do have the ability to publicly dedicate our offsetting. For those that aren\u2019t familiar, Klima offers their love letters project https://www.loveletter.klimadao.finance/ I really like this project and suggest we source our message here from the community.  Conclusion It\u2019s time we take our green pills. I hope with the conversation we will have here that we can refine the proposal, gain sponsorship, and ratify the proposal to declare our intention to become fully carbon-neutral, and to execute on phase 1. I look forward to your feedback.  ",

                    "content": "Writing as a member of the Gitcoin community \u2014 I love this. Gitcoin is the right organization to pioneer climate action in Web3. I support the proposal in full. When it comes to how to bring the proposal to life, I think Gitcoin has a real opportunity here. I\u2019d love to see the DAO use its expertise in internet-scale coordination to develop new ways of building a climate action program. I\u2019m working on a few ideas here with some collaborators, we\u2019ll share more soon \u2014 quadratic climate action?  The question is: how can we use the resources we devote to climate action to catalyze the most impact? I see a few avenues:  Financial  Looking backward ~$10k is not a huge amount, but it\u2019s not nothing. I\u2019d love to hear proposals from the community on which carbon projects most align with Gitcoin values, and selectively pick those from their respective carbon pools for retirement. We could quite easily build a retirement portfolio that we want to talk about. [ a bit about Filecoin Green\u2019s selection tool ] Looking forward This is a bigger opportunity in my opinion. Much of the highest quality carbon credit supply is not available on-chain right now \u2014 it\u2019s not even available in the big registries like Verra yet. I\u2019d love for the community to develop tools to identify impact projects to support on a regular basis. This let\u2019s us direct funding to the highest impact project categories in a flexible way. We have the privilege of working in a sector that is very comfortable with risk and moonshot ideas. I would love it if Gitcoin took some informed risks here and devoted capital to some out-there ideas that just might make a huge difference.  Governance / coordination  Composable governance processes mean we can lift and shift established Web3 decision-making patterns and apply them toward climate portfolio curation. At the moment, there are a few industry leaders that are thinking more in terms of impact than image. Stripe and Microsoft stand out. We should take a page from their book, and explore a Web3-native way of making sense of the highest-leverage use of our resources. To start this could be as simple as a few people monitoring new on-chain supply, and the community quadratically selecting a portfolio to invest in each quarter. This is a common need and we can easily build a tool / workflow useful to other DAOs. More on this below. (Related \u2014 is anyone working on a carbon curation DAO? Noting that this would definitely require deep expertise to be credible.) More broadly, how can we experiment with Web3 institution-building to create adaptive processes of deploying capital into the highest impact project categories, based on the scientific evidence? Web3 moves fast \u2014 can we lead the way and front-run the world by surfacing and accelerating the most promising new projects and technologies? Getting $30k to a promising new project could accelerate scaling by a year \u2014 which could make a huge difference to our future.  gitcoin-cdr622\u00d7622 52.5 KB   Vibes  Gitcoin leads when it comes to building Web3 culture. The greenpilled meme and the narrative building around cryptonative regeneracy is pushing and pulling our communities in the right direction. The money Gitcoin devotes to climate action will help, but continuing to activate the community and create the expectation for climate consciousness amongst Web3 builders and users could be a force multiplier on any funding we provide. This will obviously work best if it\u2019s true to our values. But generally, this means really leaning in and devoting resources beyond the initial retirement funding. Any education campaigns should be optimize to increase both the motivation and the ability with which others in Web3 can take action to support the Earth. Overall I\u2019m proposing that we take advantage of our strengths to make sure the efforts we make towards regenerating the Earth have the highest impact. This means using our resources to push the boundary \u2014 investing in next gen carbon projects, establishing forkable processes for DAOs to take climate action, and telling the story in an engaging way.  Steps forward First step is to choose which carbon tokens we want to retire to offset historical emissions. What does the Gitcoin community value? Technology-based? Nature-based? Established registries? Or new methodologies? My vote would be for the community to collectively design a retirement portfolio that showcases the best and brightest of Web3 carbon. I can see a few options to achieve this:  Delegate to a sub-committee Run a Twitter poll or two Put it to a quadratic vote A round of quadratic matching for a few carbon credit types in the next grants round Any other ideas?  To achieve this, we\u2019ll need to identify which tokenized carbon credits are eligible to be included in the portfolio. This is pretty important \u2014 retiring low quality credits A: does not constitute legitimate climate action and B: would expose the DAO to negative press if (when) someone digs into the retirements. Transparency  Beyond the obvious candidates, I would personally advocate for us to save some funding to deploy into the next-gen and forward carbon credits that will be available on-chain soon. And of course, memes are everything \u2014 the storytelling should get a lot of emphasis. This collective retirement portfolio curation process is a community pattern we will be able to reuse \u2026 this past week in Paris the ReFi community came together and hatched some ideas \u2026 more soon\u2122\ufe0f  \u261d One challenge here: as a best practice, we would choose *specific projects* rather than the reference tokens, so we understand what we\u2019re supporting and can tell that story. But nuance is the enemy of simplicity, so we could also ask a few trusted, informed community / DAO members to choose which specific projects we offset with.   Climate action isn\u2019t a \u201cthing\u201d to be \u201cdone\u201d \u2014 climate consciousness is a mindset to adopt. It\u2019s one of the things that makes climate change such a challenging issue to address: humans want a finish line, and there\u2019s no finish line here. There is no battle to be won. Gitcoin is a Schelling point for the hopeful. Let\u2019s lead by showing an optimistic, organized, cogent example for taking catalytic climate action using these global coordination tools we\u2019re all uncovering together. ",

                    "content": "Hi all, I\u2019m hoping we can revive this discussion in the new year. Now that the Alpha Round is complete and Grants is live, I think a nice way to both solve this logjam of deciding how to allocate funding to different classes of offers and dogfood the new protocol would be to run a quadratic funding round matched by Gitcoin\u2019s own funds to allocate across different carbon credit projects. For instance, we could select a few projects from each carbon credit pool (BCT, NCT, UBO and NBO, with MCO2 being another option but treated as a bundle of 4 projects rather than a single project) There two potential mechanisms for then allocating capital amongst those choices:  The community would then fund these projects just like any other grant round, and the funds would be used to retire credits from the selected project/pool. Alternatively, the new Snapshot Gitcoin Passport integration could be used to allow any GTC holders with a passport to vote on how the Gitcoin treasury\u2019s funds would be allocated across a variety of carbon credit types via quadratic voting.  There is some concern about the DAO getting front-run and all of a given project getting used up before the DAO has a chance\u2026 so we might have to limit to only projects with relatively large volumes available relative to the size of the retirements to be made. As linked in the original post above, the KlimaDAO digital carbon dashboard has a list of how many credits from each project are present in each pool, we\u2019d just need to narrow down that list to projects that fit Gitcoin\u2019s constraints (mostly around having enough supply) Does that sound like a reasonable approach? If the approach sounds reasonable, happy to start the ball rolling by providing some info on a few projects in each pool I think might be a good fit ",

Really timely, as you said, with the ability to use either the Grant Stack to QF fund our Carbon offsetting, or using a Quadratic Vote on Snapshot. I\u2019m looping in @M0nkeyFl0wer and @shawn16400 to help think through the voting design, and Ben especially to ensure we\u2019re building an impactful offsetting process. Let\u2019s finally make this happen! ",
