                    "content": " Permissionless Bridge Deployment: Arbitrum Nova Hi everyone, The Arbitrum team is about to launch Arbitrum Nova, a new Arbitrum chain (distinct from their existing Arbitrum One Rollup chain) that uses their new AnyTrust technology.   Nova1270\u00d7944 75.1 KB    Bridge Security Unlike Rollup chains, which directly inherit their security properties from the security of Ethereum, AnyTrust chains use a weaker security model which enables them to offer lower transaction fees. In a nutshell, where Rollups require transaction data to be posted as costly calldata to L1 (enabling anyone to trustlessly validate the state of the L2), AnyTrust allows a Data Availability Committee of N members to hold the transaction data off-chain. The security of the chain is based on the assumption that at least K-of-N Data Availability Committee members are honest. When that holds, the chain can operate in two different modes, based on the number S of committee members willing to sign an attestation claiming that the data is being held by the committee:  If a quorum S \u2265 N+1-K of committee members is cooperating, the Data Availability Committee can be trusted and the data doesn\u2019t need to be posted on L1, enabling cheaper transactions (\u201dturbo mode\u201d) if K \u2264 S < N+1-K, the Data Availability Committee cannot be relied on and the data will need to be posted on L1 (fallback to \u201crollup mode\u201d).   Launching Canonical DAI on Arbitrum Nova For the same reasons we decided to deploy a custom governance-controlled canonical Dai contract on Arbitrum and Optimism, the PE team believes it would be desirable to deploy a canonical Dai contract on Arbitrum Nova ahead of the chain launch next week. This will prevent confusion among Dai users and avoid having to orchestrate a complex token migration later on if/when the community decides to support Maker Teleport or Dai minting on that chain. The good news is that the exact same bridge codebase that we deployed on the Arbitrum One chain can be redeployed as-is on Arbitrum Nova, with the only necessary changes being the addresses of the new Inbox and Arbitrum Router contracts.  Technical Detail The following seeks to inform the Arbitrum team to setGateways() on their router:   \"l1DaiGateway\": \"0x97f63339374fCe157Aa8Ee27830172d2AF76A786\",   \"l2DaiGateway\": \"0x10E6593CDda8c58a1d0f14C5164B376352a55f2F\",   \"l1Dai\": \"0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F\",   \"l2Dai\": \"0xDA10009cBd5D07dd0CeCc66161FC93D7c9000da1\",   Key Takeaway This post is informing Governance that PECU will deploy a simple (permissionless) bridge. As such there are no specific risk parameters to be set until Teleport and/or DAI minting are enabled. Due to the permissionless nature of the bridge, no executive is required to support the formal bridge. This deployment will ensure that users of Arbitrum Nova will be using canonical DAI from the beginning, thereby removing the need for any token migration. ",
