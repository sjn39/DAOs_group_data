                    "content": "That is indeed a tough one. In fact I think it might be almost impossible to answer due to the large number of different collateral types and ways to buy crypto with Dai. There is of course an upper limit: Assume one ETH is $100. Alice deposits 15 ETH, worth $1,500, to her Vault. She generates 1,000 Dai against it (the maximum possible given the 150% collateralization requirement), and then uses the Dai generated to purchase 10 ETH, which she deposits back into her Vault. Alice can now generate a further 667 Dai against the extra $1,000 in ETH collateral. Purchasing $667 of ETH allows her to generate a further 444 Dai. Repeating this process provides a further 296 Dai, then 198 Dai, 131 Dai, 88 Dai, and 59 Dai. Ultimately a total of 3,000 Dai can be generated against the original 15 ETH, enabling Alice to leverage her initial stake by 200%. Though in practice, that would make you very vulnerable to price fluctuations, and doesn\u2019t take into account slippage or gas. ",

Maybe one shortcut on a smaller sample size would be to check how many users interacted with Instadapp service that does this automatically. But again it will give you limited information if you are looking for aggregated leverage. Also, you could look at largest vaults that represent majority of DAI minted and see whether they have DAI deposited on stablecoin liquidity mining venues for farming purposes which basically implies zero additional exposure to collateral. A lot of DAI from ETH vaults is still recycled at Compound. ",
