                    "content": "After the approval of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set we are now officially in the Pregame phase of the Endgame Plan, which is about building the basic tools necessary to launch the first MetaDAOs and move to the Early Game. The recent tragic events both in the broader crypto industry and our own community only means that this is the right time to focus on building and getting stronger so we can continue to lead the industry and prove that crypto can benefit people in the real world, as we always have. The MetaDAO Launch will be a massive milestone for Maker, and the biggest game changer since the launch of MCD as it will massively decentralize the current bureaucracy, and put in place strong and derisked voter incentives that will likely shift the balance of power in Maker Governance from MKR whales to MKR delegates working on behalf of grassroots MKR holders. This thread is to give a quick overview of what the most important milestones are, and the 4 major workstreams to watch. This list is likely incomplete, and there are also many smaller work streams and somewhat separate features that should happen during the Pregame but aren\u2019t necessarily a requirement for the MetaDAO Launch. Any input that helps identify missing gaps or increases clarity will be much appreciated, and I expect to continuously edit this thread as more information becomes available.  1) Pregame Product smart contracts The Pregame product smart contracts are the building blocks necessary to launch the on-chain components of the MetaDAOs. It includes:  EtherDai token wrapper deployment Elixir Balancer pool deployment MetaDAO ERC20 token deployments (one for each MetaDAO) Meta Elixir Uniswap v2 pool deployments (one for each MetaDAO) Anti-Reflexivity Mechanic deployments (one for each MetaDAO)  Linear token sales mechanism to prevent price spikes   Dai Farms (one for each MetaDAO) EtherDai Farms (one for each MetaDAO) MKR Farms (one for each MetaDAO) Metanomics I deployment  70000 MKR emitted per year, with 60000 funneled directly to the Meta Elixir of each of the MetaDAOs   Various dss-kiln and proxy contract deployments to manage accounts and token flows for MetaDAOs  Of these features, I believe that the ETHD Farms and the MKR farms are the only ones that are somewhat technically challenging in terms of new code required, while the rest is almost all extremely simple code and implementation.  2) MVP of the MetaDAO frontends A MetaDAO is defined by its frontend, so it is vital to have quality frontends available for the Launch MetaDAOs enabling users to farm MetaDAO tokens and build up communities for the MetaDAOs. It also provides vital access to Maker Governance which will drastically increase voter participation when combined with the MetaDAO token farming which acts as a voter incentive mechanism. It requires the following features:  Access to all Dai Farms Access to opening Maker Vaults (including EtherDai Vaults) Access to all EtherDai Vault Farms Access to all MKR Farms MVP of the Easy Voter Frontend that is required for users who wish to farm with MKR, as they need to first delegate through this frontend to be able to farm with MKR Support for MetaDAOs adding their own products or external services.   3) The MetaDAO Cluster journey All the MetaDAOs and the clusters must go through a set of steps before their governance, communities and potential internal teams will be ready for the launch of the MetaDAOs.  Cluster announcements - this has already been done by several Clusters Vote to include announced Clusters as Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters Creation of MetaDAO forums - this must be clean slates without affiliation to particular Clusters Early meta development of the new MetaDAO forums Approval of the starting MIP-like infrastructure of new MetaDAOs by Maker Governance (e.g., specifying a standard MIP0 and MIP39 equivalent for new MetaDAOs allowing them to function properly) Preparation of MIP39-equivalent onboarding proposals by the Clusters to a specific MetaDAO each (there will be exactly as many Launch MetaDAOs as there are Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters) Launch of the MetaDAO frontends and the Pregame Smart contracts, which begins the distribution of MetaDAO tokens to Dai, ETHD and MKR holders Onboarding of the Clusters as Administration Teams to each of the MetaDAOs Normal operation of the MetaDAOs with Administration Teams in charge of running their governance processes and facilitating budgets and community decisions.   4) The Endgame Consitution and the Endgame Scope Frameworks The Constitution and Scope Frameworks will be the primary way that the processes of Maker Governance itself will be locked down, to prevent corruption or instability of direction over time. The constitution will govern eligibility for compensation from Maker Core as a Mandated Actor, Recognized Delegate or Recognized Decentralized Voter Committee. It will significantly disincentive political attempts to overturn the Endgame State or make significant changes to Maker Governance by making such actions result in ineligibility for compensation from Maker Core. Obviously, to prevent harmful premature ossification the Constitution must be carefully designed and the definition of \u201csignificant changes\u201d must start out wide and only narrow over time. The Endgame Scope Frameworks are directly linked to the constitution as it defines exactly which Scope Frameworks will exist, and makes it very difficult to change, add or remove them. The Scope Frameworks are then used for all lower level decision or rules around specific implementation or actions by the Decentralized Workforce, MetaDAOs or Ecosystem Actors, and any compensation, risk parameter modification proposals or protocol modification proposals that are supposed to happen over time as a part of the long term Endgame Equilibrium. All decisions that are currently made somewhat ad hoc, and that often used to be done through processes such as signal requests of MIP6es, should be standardized into being covered by one of the Scope Frameworks designated by the Endgame Constitution.  Community transparency Each of these 4 work streams must be completed in 2023 to ensure the Endgame Plan is on track, and it will be important to ensure there is as much transparency as possible on their implementation in order to allow the community to follow up and oversee that things are happening at the right pace and with the right level of quality and thoughtfulness. At the same time it will undoubtedly be an intense and chaotic time for the decentralized workforce, with lots of changes happening, and as a result the complete level of transparency that we will be able to enforce once the Endgame Plan is in full swing cannot be expected during the Pregame phase, because the top priority must be to deliver all of the milestones before the end of 2023. My impression is that so far most of the critical members of the Decentralized Workforce are already taking proactive and thoughtful steps to make sure the implementation of these milestones is realistic and that significant effort is going into detecting any gaps that could slip through our fingers and unexpectedly block or delay launch.

                    "content": "The main requirement is that they can be downloaded and all write actions can be used locally from day 1. In particular sending dai, opening vaults, farming metaDAO tokens and delegating MKR must be possible locally from launch. Running frontends locally is the strongest form of decentralization, even better than ENS/IPFS. It is relatively easy to do for write, but a lot more difficult for reading historical or real time information (getting your vault history and other convenience stuff like that). Initially, from my perspective there is no problem with using centralized services for read. The critical thing is that fully decentralized, local write must be fully functional and possible with reasonable ease. Even if reading information breaks, it\u2019s easy to use a third party service such as etherscan or coingecko to get the critical information, as long as it\u2019s still possible to send transactions. The place where these issues converge the most is MKR farming and incentivized voter delegation. That\u2019s a situation where having access to up to date information is important, and centralized manipulation or censorship is a security concern for the maker protocol. So that\u2019s likely where decentralized storage and caching efforts should focus on first. ",
