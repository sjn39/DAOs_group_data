                    "content": "@PaperImperium is transitioning to @GFXlabs. Mirroring this transition, at the time of writing, the old delegation contract still has 8,506.43 MKR delegated while the new delegation contract only as 5.02 MKR. This transition alerted me to a shortcoming in the proposed delegate compensation MIP, but the problem will affect all delegates, not just @PaperImperium. Currently, delegate contracts expire after one year. Delegates will need to create new delegate contracts and ask delegated MKR to migrate. This migration will cause volatility in delegate compensation. GovAlpha has clarified that delegates shall be compensated without reference to other delegates, even in this case when there is a clear intent to migrate. I propose that a component be added to MIP61 to accommodate delegate contract migration:  In the event that a Recognized Delegate intends to migrate from one delegate contract to another, a special procedure is available to reduce unpredictable compensation. The delegate must inform governance 7 days in advance of the migration effective date and which contracts are affected. The new delegate contract cannot already be involved in a migration (e.g., two delegates merging into one). During a 15 day interim period, the old and new delegate contracts are regarded, for the purpose of compensation, as referring to the same entity and compensation calculated using stats from both the old and new contracts. For example, MKR weight will be obtained by the sum of the MKR weight of the old and new contracts. Participation and communication stats will register the most favorable stats considering both the old and new contracts.     Amend MIP61 to allow for a migration period between delegate contracts  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     This poll shall be active for two weeks, closing on Dec 02. If \u2018Yes\u2019 has more votes than \u2018No\u2019 then MIP61 shall be so amended. ",

So the one year limit  was quite intentional. Since it\u2019s a permissionless system, there\u2019s a good chance that we might lose touch with either the delegates or the person delegating in a year;s time. By having the expiration date, it helps close the gap and make sure that people who delegate are reevaluating their decision at least once a year. Not having an expiration date could lead to a situation where there is a large amount of MKR stuck on a hat with no way to move it. It helps mitigate the \u201cbus risk\u201d of a delegate not being able to move the vote themselves, without being too burdensome on the delegate or the people delegating. This time frame could be adjusted, but I would causion against getting rid of it completely. ",

MIP61 remains in RFC and as such does not require a Signal Request to change, this is what the RFC period is for! You can insert that component into MIP61 now if you like without a Signal Request. The suggestion to start a Signal Request in the previous thread was to cover a one-off payment to GFXlabs for the specific instance of PaperImperium moving from one Delegate Platform to another. It is still possible for a Signal Request to take place to allow this. I\u2019m happy to assist in writing it if you would find that helpful. The 12-month expiration on delegate contracts has been addressed by @prose11 in his post.
