                    "content": "Overview Provide vaults on existing collateral but different terms. Instead of a variable-rate vault that can have collateral added or DAI paid until the vault is closed or liquidated, provide a vault with a fixed payment schedule for a fixed lump sum of DAI. Whether the stability fee rate should be fixed or variable is still an open question. Background Those who follow the chat will know there\u2019s been some talk about some differently structured vaults (like ones that are acceptable for those with religious proscriptions on interest). After soliciting some loose opinions from several folks about the technical complexity, a good first step may be to offer vaults similar to the current ones, but with a fixed payment schedule and a single lump sum of DAI, as it seems easier to implement without utilizing as many of the scarce resources of the smart contracts team. Purpose For a user, payment that is on a fixed schedule eliminates the risk of sudden liquidation during an unforeseen extreme market event. Our products offer leverage to those who don\u2019t wish to sell their underlying collateral, so the risk of liquidation likely keeps our most conservative \u2013 and likely most credit-worthy \u2013 users far away from the liquidation threshold for their vaults. This is generally a good thing, but with knowledge they won\u2019t get liquidated until after missed payments, these users may be interested in levering a bit more, which would result in more fees for us. In short, this should be a better customer experience for users who avoid or underutilize traditional vaults for fear of liquidation when not very actively managing their vaults during turbulent markets. Happier customers are repeat customers. From our side, this would introduce more market risk, as the value of collateral can continue to fall before a payment is missed but after a traditional vault would have been liquidated. This is a concern that would need to be weighed. If we chose to offer fixed rates along with a fixed payment schedule, that would also introduce interest rate risk. The benefits, however, would be a reduction in timing risk with regard to liquidation. In the event of a sudden market downturn, this would create rolling liquidations, as vaults would not be eligible for liquidation until scheduled payments had been missed. In some cases, this will allow the collateral\u2019s market value to rise, and liquidation avoided. In some cases, this will allow the collateral\u2019s market value to continue to deteriorate. An added benefit would be greater predictability of DAI cash flow into the Stability Buffer. We currently have excellent knowledge of receivable growth, but due to the flexible repayment schedules offered, that does not necessarily translate into DAI received on a certain schedule and receivables are still vulnerable to loss in bad-case scenarios. Risk Profile of User It is hard to extrapolate well-established characteristics of developed debt markets to the crypto debt market, as the users are by their nature self-selecting into the system. That being said, it seems very likely that someone inclined to choose a fixed-schedule vault would be more risk averse than someone taking a standard vault. At the least, it seems improbable that the two vaults would be used in the same way by the same user, and over time it may become apparent how they differ, and allow for more/less allowed leverage or higher/lower stability fees in one type of vault vs another. It also provides us a tool to manage risk of disorderly liquidations due to high volume in a short time. Fixed Rate/Fixed Debt Fixed payment schedule does not necessarily equate to a fixed rate of fees. A credit card is an example of a line of credit with a variable rate but a fixed payment schedule. It also allows the user to draw further upon their credit line. At the other end of the spectrum are car or home loans, which typically use fixed rates and a declining balance of debt owed. And one can imagine a vault with any combination of these features of fixed/variable rates, one-time draw or revolving credit. Under the right circumstances, any would be appropriate. Personally, since the idea is to diversify both the timing risk associated with mass liquidations and to attract a more risk-averse user, I would propose a fixed-schedule, one-time draw vault, either with or without a fixed rate. Why One-Time Draw/Lump Sum With a set loan issued upon receipt of collateral, each scheduled payment reduces risk to Maker, as the collateral remains unchanged in quantity, but the exposure to the individual loan declines over time, shifting the risk of slow, ongoing price declines in the underlying collateral to the user. Our risk is defined and reduced over the life of the vault. In a traditional vault, Maker becomes more and more exposed to the risks associated with liquidation in the event of slow, steady declines. Summary Offering a new set of terms for loans on the same collateral gives us diversification of user risk profiles, reduces timing pressure on the liquidation ecosystem in the event of a mass downturn, provides users with a way to know with certainty when liquidation can occur, reduces the exposure of Maker to losses on each individual vault as older vintage vaults would have repaid a greater portion of their principal and fees while still holding collateral steady, and increases the predictability of when stability fees owed will actually be deposited into the Stability Buffer. This can provide us with a greater offering to customers with existing collateral types, which hopefully should be fairly easy to do risk analysis upon. I would like to hear reactions to the financial structure, how difficult this would be to implement technically, and how much user education would need to occur from Content and other related teams. Please also include thoughts on fixed/variable stability fees for this product. Attn: @SebVentures @hexonaut @seth @Primoz and many others who may have relevant domain knowledge. ",

As time passes, the fixed payment schedule reduces our exposure to that vault and makes us less sensitive to price movements of the underlying asset X. We are in effect long time in some regards, as the same collateral is backing a shrinking loan balance. As time passes, the standard vault increases our exposure to price movements of asset X unless the user is repaying DAI or depositing collateral. But the original collateral is backing a larger receivable since we need our stability fees paid as well as principal repayment. Can this structure be used to speculate? Of course. But a key point is that the speculative uses should be different, as even using the DAI to buy more of asset X and then getting a new loan compartmentalizes the risk for each leg of that trade. And gives us more predictable payment of our receivables. Or that\u2019s the idea. ",

Whether the stability fee rate should be fixed or variable is still an open question.   If the interest rate is variable, the loan would amortize at a variable rate so the length of repayment schedule could not be know at the time of origination.     PaperImperium:  with knowledge they won\u2019t get liquidated until after missed payments, these users may be interested in levering a bit more, which would result in more fees for us.   In consumer lending markets, the banks willingness to lend is heavily dependent on not only the consumer\u2019s ability to repay (income and assets), but also the institution\u2019s ability to collect on the funds if the borrower defaults. In consumer lending this is handled through the traditional legal and credit reporting systems, but I don\u2019t think this would be feasible for defi lending where we don\u2019t assess identity and credit risk. Our only defense against borrowers selectively defaulting on their loans is excess collateral and liquidation penalties. Also, fewer transactions is generally a benefit, will users prefer to need to make regular eth txs for loan payments versus paying only as needed? ",

We basically offer secured credit cards with no minimum payment as it is.

Otherwise users would just put their bags in the loan type as cheap insurance, passing a large percentage of asset risk off to the protocol. But we could easily offer something similar to this if we are not taking on more price risk than our interest income. Could look into a vault like you describe but with us buying price insurance from a crypto provider to cover the tail risk. I guess at the end of the day it\u2019s a question of demand.

In particular, as we attract institutional users, we want to know when their flows go in and out as related to what type of user they are. Unrelated to the suggestion outlined above, but relevant to segmenting and diversifying users of different risk profiles, it may be a good move to offer small fee discounts for private vaults to large users. Not necessarily to attract their business when we already offer competitive terms, but to know our customers, which will become increasingly important if we want to diversify our customer base and terms tailored to them.

In this case, we need to separate the \u201crepayment schedule\u201d with the over-collateralization of the loan.  Repayment Schedule As @monet-supply suggested, with a fixed interest rate, it would be quite easy to calculate a repayment schedule. That said, in this case, you would be setting more constraints for the users (with no apparent benefit).  As a user, you\u2019re probably better off choosing the \u201cflexible repayment schedule\u201d that\u2019s in place today. You do have an \u201cadvantage\u201d (the free ride) towards the beginning of the loan, but a clear disadvantage towards the end (assuming liquidation if the schedule fails).   Over-Collateralization As @prose11 mentioned, we need to keep the system secure (and we achieve this by over-collateralization). How often the user repays nowadays have nothing to do with the overcollateralization. When a loan becomes undercollateralized, we need to liquidate the collateral. Maybe you\u2019re suggesting that a user could choose to avoid liquidation by having the liquidation removed? I think it comes down to this:  When the price of the collateral type drops, any (purely economical) rational user would take the Dai they borrowed and repurchase the collateral in the open market at a better price.

I\u2019m still turning over in my head how to avoid undercollateralization without the vault being put-able debt. It may simply be that it will only work on assets that are less volatile or on users we have some prior knowledge of. Yet another reason I\u2019d like to find ways to know who our repeat users are and how they behave. At some point some CeFi will figure out how to peel away the most responsible customers who are effectively overpaying by being lumped into an average risk profile. A great example is GEICO, who famously divined that people who take government jobs are more risk averse and could be offered cheaper car insurance than the population at large ",

Instead of making payments to MakerDAO weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly; premiums are paid to Whiteheart/HEGIC for wrapping ETH and WBTC with a put option. If the collateral ever falls in value, the difference is paid to the vault in USDC maintaining its original value assuming the underlying crypto asset falls in price. If it rises in value, then the vault has a credit limit increase since the collateral has appreciated. Hence, non-liquidatable fully-collateralized loans with a fixed duration. It would be a win for MakerDAO since it would protect from Black Thursday-type events. It would be a win for customers to be able to sleep well at night while having all of the upside of ETH/WBTC and none of the downside of being liquidated due to market risk. ETH-A is already the most popular vault in the system. It would only require evaluating the risk of HEGIC options. If they are safe, then the underlying assets are safe by extension. ",
