Who are the people that are against the obvious winner of \u201cBuyback & Burn\u201d which will push UNI to a price above $100? Let\u2019s find out. It\u2019s members from VC\u2019s and also Liquidity Miners.   VC\u2019s are vultures  and aren\u2019t here for the long-term anyway because they have performance results every quarter and want to dump their tokens immediately for their balance sheet. Liquidity Miners are scared  of holding a token longer than 17 hours. They want to constantly dump their rewards, hence why they only vote for more rewards and are short-sighted. Uniswap hodlers are all here and we are the majority. We don\u2019t need these short-sighted and ignorant participants to weigh down on the future of Uniswap.  It\u2019s clear, use the 0.05% protocol fee switch to buy back and burn the token. Uniswap is a long-term hodl. Do not listen to VC\u2019s and Liquidity miners as they are only looking out for their selfish interests. Also, Dividend payment is inferior because it has tax implications for everyone. If you are receiving \u201cUni dividends\u201d into an account, it makes it a lot more messy. Instead, doing the buyback & burn is extremely superior. Reward the Hodlers. Punish the speculators.  Uni power, $100 here we come ",

Secondly, buy and burn gives the VC\u2019s you hate so much more power as it leaves less Uni on the open market for us, and their proportion of the total will increase and eventually could exceed 50%. Sure, I\u2019d like the price to go up but never at the cost of ruining decentralisation, allowing the public to have less than a 50% share of the tokens. In terms of taxes, while I pay mine it\u2019s safe to assume a lot in DeFi are less willing to generally and we shouldn\u2019t be creating a structure based on what\u2019s gives you in your country the most post tax gain, it needs to be what\u2019s good for the protocol as a whole. I have more reasons posted on the channel linked below, I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019ve created a new one, and I\u2019ll only respond there in future for related questions so we don\u2019t have 100\u2019s of duplicated channels.     [POLL] How Would We Structure a Fee Reward? Proposal Discussion       Very interesting discussion, the option to switch on the fee should be available from mid march according to the 180 day time lock.  After reading through all these messages, I see the reasons not to buy and burn but to instead distribute X to all those that stake in the UNI voting contract for the following reasons;    Incentivises staking in the voting mechanism rather than just passive holding (As only those that register to vote get the benefits from fee distribution, encouraging more to vot\u2026     ",
