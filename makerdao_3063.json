What are your plans to grow it? 23:38 - Lea (reading from chat): Can you introduce where they fit and how they intereact with the actors of the value chain, freight carriers, customs, et cetera? 25:33 - Gregory Di Prisco: Where do you demonstrate your underwriting standards and how can the Maker holders keep track of that? 27:55 - Gregory Di Prisco: What level of visibility would the Maker holders have into that through a Tinlake? Can we click on an individual loan and see all the details that you just described to me? 29:28 - Gregory Di Prisco: Do we have an approval mechanism for new loans entering the pool? How do we know that a horribly rated company is not going to be pushed into the pool? What\u2019s the blocker mechanism there? 32:24 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: How often are the prices updated?

Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 01:01:47  I want to be mindful of people\u2019s times. Let\u2019s keep the conversation going in the forum. I think all your names are there. I don\u2019t know, Seb, if you want to mention something before closing (01:02:08). Thanks again to Harbor Trade, Fortunafi and Peoples Company. It was great having you guys. See you next year and have a great holiday.  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
