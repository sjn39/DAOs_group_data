                    "content": " Motivation The idea to create a EuroDAI is on the roadmap for a long time. Currently, the \u20ac token market is dominated by EURS and sEUR from Synthetix with a $40M market cap for each. There are a Curve pool and Uniswap pairs. Celo is soon launching its cEUR. Things are moving. A part of the opportunity is that it\u2019s super hard to create a fiat-backed EUR stablecoin as the Eurozone is under negative interest rates. Being a EUR-based citizen myself, I struggle to keep assets and have lost a fair amount of money last year because of $ depreciation. I don\u2019t think EURS or sEUR are the best solutions.  Proposition I can see 4 path to achieve this target:  Create a DAI-EuroDAI vault: Doesn\u2019t seem capital efficient Create a DAI-EuroDAI PSM: Seems hard to avoid creating an arbitrage opportunity (or it leads to a high spread, meaning EuroDAI will fluctuate a lot) Integrate EuroDAI inside the current Maker Protocol: Seems super complicated Duplicate a Maker Protocol based on the \u20ac currency instead of $  I will focus on the last one bit please present other solutions or discuss the others. At a macro level, it would something like the diagram below. Currently, the MKR token holders govern the DAI protocol. We would just add a copy of the DAI Protocol, still governed by MKR The code would be almost the same with the same Oracle system (but EUR feeds). the Surplus Buffer of the EuroDAI protocol would be expressed in EuroDAI and not in DAI. There would be a separated rate proposal group.  image809\u00d7788 16.9 KB  The minor difference is that there would be no flapper or flopper in the EuroDAI system at the beginning (beta phase). This way, the system is obviously a bit more risky but this avoid any negative impact from this system to the rest of the Maker Ecosystem. When more proven, flopper/flapper can be added. EuroDAI stabilization can be achieved either using a EURS PSM and/or a DAI PSM/Vault. The advantage of this approach is that it allows a clear separation of work and avoid putting another task to the SC Core Unit. There probably one year of work at best to get the thing running and to achieve a bit of traction. I think this decentralized approach makes sense and allows us to move at the speed of DeFi. If this discussion leads to something we can move to a declaration of intend. ",

I\u2019d hate for us to go to all that effort to discover there is like 100M of demand at most.

For example, the euroDAI protocol should probably only have the following vault types:  euroDAI-(sEUR, EURS, cEUR) PSM with a similar fee to the PSM-USDC-A in the current system. DAI vault with fairly low ratio to allow forex. euroDAI-DAI PSM with a relatively high fee to counteract exchange rate losses. ETH-A vault. WBTC-A vault.  And they should be implemented in that order (probably.) Additionally, the main usdDAI protocol should have:  A euroDAI vault to allow for forex in the opposite direction. A DAI-euroDAI PSM with a relatively high fee to counteract exchange rate losses.  Something like that maybe? ",

LongForWisdom:  euroDAI-DAI PSM with a relatively high fee to counteract exchange rate losses.   This one (suggested by @swakya , and myself as well) is actually not possible. When we create a EuroDAI it creates a liability for the Maker Protocol. I assume we want each EuroDAI to be backed by 1\u20ac of asset. So after the first use of the EuroDAI-DAI PSM you end up with 1\u20ac of liability and $1.20 of assets (assuming 1\u20ac = $1.20). If 1\u20ac is now worth $1.40, the system would be insolvent by $0.20 (or around 0.15\u20ac). The EuroDAI on the liability would be backed by only 0.85\u20ac ($1.20) while you need 1\u20ac ($1.40). If you are short \u20ac (which is what issuing EuroDAI means), you need to be long \u20ac (holding EURS for instance, or a \u20ac loan backed by ETH) in order to be hedged. Otherwise, you take currency risk. It\u2019s like borrowing in \u20ac to buy a US house.     swakya:  Just thought of another possibility : update the core system to allow drawing from any vault in both euroDAI and usdDAI. It seems more risky than cloning, and I have most certainly not thought through whether that even makes sense economically   Exactly my point, pushing DAI to be able to handle multi-currencies is super complex. Cloning provides a lot of benefits like decentralization, having multiple teams working in parallel, and risk containment. If one system is shut down, the others might be not affected. This might save the day at some point ",

LongForWisdom:  For example, the euroDAI protocol should probably only have the following vault types:  euroDAI-(sEUR, EURS, cEUR) PSM with a similar fee to the PSM-USDC-A in the current system. DAI vault with fairly low ratio to allow forex. euroDAI-DAI PSM with a relatively high fee to counteract exchange rate losses. ETH-A vault. WBTC-A vault.  And they should be implemented in that order (probably.)   I differ from @LongForWisdom opinion here. DAI grew from with starting with just ETH backed vaults as collateral. Would make sense to me that ETH backed vaults would be close to the top of your priority list to give yourself the best chance at success. I\u2019m not sure that all of the investment would be throwaway work either. For instance, There is probably enough demand for a ETH:EURO oracle it might be worth building in its own right. Then see what sort market interest there is. If you see some usage you double down on your investment if not then either leave it at that or shut it down. FWIW i think this probably a great idea. Seems like a real growth opportunity and there are less entrenched incumbents in the EURO stablecoin market. ",

Rather than duplicating everything, each rate for borrowed assets against a vault could have an interest rate offset and possibly a CR offset vs usdDai(which would always be the reference asset).

Currently we\u2019ve got Liquidations 2.0 work, MIP21 & MIP22 work, DssGov work, and the keg, the vox, the flash, and the cropjoin have all been approved, plus everything else in the MIP backlog, and we\u2019re going to need to find some time for scaling research as well. In order to pull this off you\u2019d want signoff from smart contracts and we don\u2019t have the bandwidth for this. Weekly spellcrafting and tooling around that process already takes a significant amount of our time, and adding an entirely new system to our monitoring, maintenance, and manipulation workflow means that little else will get done at all. Governance has had it\u2019s work cut out maintaining demand around the USD peg, these problems will be compounded by adding another base accounting module and collateral risk exposure. Does governance really want to manage a separate system and peg in a climate where it can barely get the votes to pass an executive as-is? And where the gas costs on the network prohibit casual use anyways? The MCD system is open-source and it\u2019s within the crypto spirit to copy and rename this, but the core team just doesn\u2019t have the bandwith to assist, as such, I\u2019d recommend that MKR holders absolutely not give MKR minting authority to backstop a secondary system at this time. Ideas are easy and we have plenty of them. Prioritizing the resources we currently have is the problem here. It\u2019s so easy to vote \u201cYES\u201d on a proposal, but that yes vote has consequences as it throws more work on us that we then have to prioritize and implement. Throwing community devs onto projects to skirt the core team\u2019s bandwidth limitations only increases the pressure on us since we\u2019re going to end up reviewing code anyways, the net result being that you\u2019ll end up with fewer resources than you began with. We\u2019d much rather those devs work with us to help process our existing priority queue. IMO we need to focus on making our core protocol and offerings more robust and secure, and training up a large enough team to safely and securely manage the system. Maker\u2019s value proposition right now is that people feel safe in our smart contracts, and compromising that security by stretching too thin will ultimately erode Maker\u2019s top position. ",

This is exactly the proposal (and why I even suggested that eurMKR might be a solution at some point in the future). Some people see eurDAI as a great opportunity for MakerDAO where we can take the first place (smaller market but bigger market share). At the same time, it will not be the priority for the SC Core Unit neither in 2021 and probably not in 2022 (I\u2019m sure you have plenty of ideas to make usdDAI even more successful). The SC is only one part, DAI had a whole foundation behind it that made it a success. Just setting up the right team and launching a beta will take the rest of the year. It might fail for plenty of reasons not related to smart contracts. I feel it will always be a bad idea to put core SC resources on such a venture. So let\u2019s wait for success before investing scarce resources. This is also a perfect example of where we can achieve decentralization, agility, and resiliency. Ideas are easy for sure, and, at this stage, it\u2019s only an idea. But some people are willing to put in the work to see the idea grow. Now the question is: should we kill this idea or not? It is my understanding that any domain team can veto it, if not, then we can move to the Declaration of Intent. ",

I think eurDAI will eventually be huge, but I feel the way to get there is to focus on Real World Assets (RWA).     Andy_McCall:  Would make sense to me that ETH backed vaults would be close to the top of your priority list   I respectfully disagree with this. In almost any crypto/fiat pairing the crypto part is way more volatile compare to its fiat counterpart. Accordingly the fiat part of the pairing is not really relevant as long as it is fiat of decent quality. In crypto, this fiat role has already been taken by USD and subsequently there is very little or nothing to be gained by any ETH-eurDAI or WBTC-eurDAI collateral types.     SebVentures:  DAI-EuroDAI vault: Doesn\u2019t seem capital efficient   Agree. Especially with RWA in mind our users are much better off simply using Curve or similar.     SebVentures:  Duplicate a Maker Protocol based on the \u20ac currency instead of $   This feels like an intensely distasteful solution. When it comes to RWA it is not only eurDAI, but also chfDAI, gbpDAI, yenDAI, cnyDAI, cadDAI, aurDAI etc etc etc. If Maker can replicate across currencies then let us do that, but if whole new organizations are going to copy-paste code and start their own DAI versions with their own governance I fear the whole DAI brand will go down in flames as the scams multiply.     SebVentures:  Integrate EuroDAI inside the current Maker Protocol   From my perspective this is what we are left with. Would it be so difficult? We would have     LongForWisdom:  euroDAI-(sEUR, EURS, cEUR) PSM   module as well as RWA collateral types such as DROP and 6S denominated in eurDAI. Anything crypto would always be usdDAI.

I felt compelled to post. I feel everyone is unfairly dismissing the DAI-EuroDAI vault option. Yes, there is capital inefficiencies for anyone wanting to go long on ETH using EuroDAI. But remember, that the ethos of MakerDAO has always been that DAI users are our customers, not Vault owners. We are trying to make the best EuroDAI, not the most seamless Vault experience. I think having the DAI-EuroDAI vault is by far the simplest option for the public to understand (improved public perception). It doesn\u2019t require any sub MKR variants. It also scales much better for the creation of other DAI-currencies. I\u2019m also heavily of the opinion that MakerDAO should prioritise control of EuroDAI and other DAI-currencies and see their successful implemtation and uptake as a matter of maintaining positive public perception / positive marketing. There is risk of copycats entering the market and getting first mover advantage here. My thoughts as well, is that having DAI (a token controlled by MKR) as the sole unit of collateral creates some intersting opportunities.   DAI demand and profit: every DAI that is placed into a Vault is natural demand for DAI and is already providing value to MakerDAO. There is no need to profit seek (double dip) for EuroDAI. Any rate setting can be used purely to control the peg.   Control when EuroDAI peg is high: When the DAI peg is high, rates need to be lowered. Or recently the PSM has been used to hold stablecoins (creating additional risk). However when the EuroDAI peg is high. Anyone can flashloan DAI, open a EuroDAI Vault, purchase EuroDAI on the open market, return the EuroDAI and keep the DAI profit. Therefore EuroDAI Vault fees can be kept close to (or at) 0% and only raised if the EuroDAI peg goes below 1.   Adding a EuroDAI-DAI Vault as an option to create DAI will drive additional demand for both currencies and open up the possibility for decentralised forex trading. This effect will be multiplicative as more DAI-currencies are added.   Vault liquidation: (partial idea). I couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion here, but I feel that liquidations with DAI as collateral should be more straightforward. Is there the opportunity for MakerDAO to instantly settle the debt? Someone with more experience than me maybe able to chime in.   I very much appreciate and respect Brian\u2019s concern about SC team workload. So maybe this can\u2019t be implemented in the short-medium term. But I think the option of copying Maker code, creating sub-MKR coins is a very short sighted and will tarnish the MakerDAO brand. We are better off waiting to create a more robust system when we have the developer talent available. ",

                    "content": "I\u2019m not a lawyer but as far as I\u2019ve read there is definitely some concern in the EU regarding stablecoins. Some of them can be read in the following links:    European Central Bank \u2013 4 Nov 20    The two sides of the (stable)coin         U.S. \u2013 11 Sep 20    Big European states call for cryptocurrency curbs to protect consumers Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands called on the European Commission to draw up strict regulation for asset-backed cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins to protect consumers and preserve state sovereignty in monetary policy.         CoinDesk \u2013 11 Sep 20    European Ministers Call on EU Commission to Regulate Stablecoins - CoinDesk Finance ministers from five European countries have called on the EU Commission to introduce tough regulation for stablecoins.      However, there are some points which really speak for a eurDAI:   Technically DAI or hopefully eurDAI aren\u2019t stablecoins in my eyes. The unique form of the protocol is more like feedback control system like a temperature controller. The protocol tries to regulate the DAI to a value by adjusting a few parameters (auctions, stability fee, etc\u2026). So it\u2019s NOT pegged 1:1 to a currency or underlying and it will never be designed to be that way. It\u2019s only here to follow the price as good as it can. We see fuctuations all the time, especially if ETH drops sharply.   Maker is an decentralized open-source community. Each and every human beeing is allowed to join this forum, make suggestions, discuss, and give input.   For an example the coindesk link says: << One such measure would mandate stablecoins all be asset-backed 1:1 with the euro and other member state currencies and that must be held in European Union-approved institutions.>> As I\u2019ve explained in the point above, that doesn\u2019t absolutely make sense in case of an euroDAI, and it can\u2019t be required anyway, since the type of the protocol is unique in my point of view. So in a discussion this point should be made clear in the first few sentences. If you have a look at the link of the ecb above, you can extract the following conclusion: <<The process of digitalisation cannot be reversed \u2013 on the contrary, it is picking up speed. Global stablecoins are an expression of the need for change. However, they can pose serious risks, both to our monetary sovereignty and financial stability and to the EU\u2019s market structure, competitiveness and technological independence. We should continue to be open to global competition in order to foster innovation. But we should first ensure that we are prepared to make the most of it, to the benefit, not the detriment, of EU citizens. The ECB\u2019s response to the ongoing transformation of the payment system is first and foremost a policy response. Our focus is on stimulating the development of safe and efficient EU payments that are fit for global competition.>> The following sentence should also be discussed further: <<But we should first ensure that we are prepared to make the most of it, to the benefit, not the detriment, of EU citizens.>> In my point of view, it\u2019s absolutely clear that EU citizens and mankind can benefit of an eurDAI. As I\u2019ve stated above: Decentralized technology gives us the unique opportunity to put trust into an open-source plattform and codelines, everyone can read for themselves. Let\u2019s have a look at the human rights section of the European Parliament:   europarl.europa.eu   Human rights | Fact Sheets on the European Union | European Parliament Read about human rights. Fact Sheets provide an overview of European integration and the role of the European Parliament.      << Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU): EU values. The EU\u2019s founding values are \u2018human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities\u2019;>> If the Maker approach isn\u2019t exactly a materialization of the lines above, I\u2019ll eat my hat. However I can only add my point of view as a technician, not as a lawyer, but I\u2019d be extremely glad to be the owner of a eurDAI. ",

The path is already taken with MIP46: Parameter Proposal Groups. The last big decision (something there was a real debate) we made was to activate the DSR. It\u2019s not currency dependant (or it would be something to experiment only in one to see the difference). Using a PSM is also not currency dependant.

This is my concern. Reflexer Labs recently cloned MCD and the deployment took them millions of dollars in investment, an Ethereum OG leading the development effort, and over a year of work. There\u2019s a reason that MCD hasn\u2019t been often duplicated outside of Ethereum\u2019s mainnet and it\u2019s because we have a huge technical and infrastructural moat that\u2019s being actively managed behind the scenes by several Foundation operational teams. We are at the foothills of a new bull market that is probably going to last for at least the next 12 months. Competent devs are not fungible and are already in scarce supply, we\u2019re just starting to see bidding wars for top talent among leading protocols. MakerDAO is not going to be immune to these economic realities and is going to have to start participating in them if we want to recruit and retain devs in this space. Solving this is a necessary precursor to expanding out to the management of a second protocol. This euroDai team would necessarily be competing for talent with the team, or it is going to dilute talent from the existing team at a time when we should be expanding to secure our exponentially-increasing collateral balances. In either case, being reckless with development resources in smart contracts can quickly and easily lead to loss of collateral, besmirching the MakerDAO \u201cbrand\u201d we\u2019ve all worked so hard to build.

Therefore, in my view,  in 3 years the reserve assets / surplus buffer need to be at least 2 pct of the circulating assets and likely more than 3 pct as DAI circulates well above the MiCA significance threshold of Euro 1 Bn. Even more worrying, we need the foundation  to register as a bank and not allow interest on deposits, unless you can convince regulators that the DSR etc is not interest and finally, reserve assets need to be held as high liquid assets. Or change the peg to CPI as earlier suggested, as we will then be magically outside EU\u2019s concerns, per directive recital 41. Maybe I have misunderstood something, but I think Seb has a point ",

Let me start by saying that any views I express here on this forum are my own and in no way representative of those of GovAlpha as a CU. I very much enjoyed reading this discussion and the insights that both sides of the argument put forward. I also think now is a good time to revisit this very topic. The macroeconomic climate of the world is growingly favorable to competitors of USD as a peg-currency. Just recently we\u2019ve seen Western states begin to buy oil in rubles, seeming to signal the end of the age of the \u201cPetrodollar\u201d and the stability that mechanism provided to the USD. I also think it is likely that other commodities will probably follow-suit in leaving-- or at least hedging against-- the USD-peg, as supply chains worldwide become more localized in response to the current global supply-chain shortage, further eroding USD\u2019s standing as a world currency. While I realize there are complications smart-contracts wise to creating a second stablecoin-peg, it may be the right move going forward. Instead of viewing such an expansion as requiring us to \u201cfork\u201d the protocol for a totally different stable, view it more as adding another module to our repertoire. USD-Dai and Euro-Dai may be the beginning, but perhaps multiple \u201cmodules\u201d of DAI could exist associated with all sorts of different currencies leading back to an unpegged universal DAI that is the amalgamation of all these separate protocols. One Dai to rule them all (and in the darkness, bind them?) Just wanted to bring some activity back to this post and share my thoughts, thanks! ",

EuroDAI definitely seems like something that is worth the DAO\u2019s time to consider in 2022, not least in light of geopolitical (and macroeconomic) developments as you mention. In particular, this bit seems key (emphasis mine):     tylermeanswell:  While I realize there are complications smart-contracts wise to creating a second stablecoin-peg, it may be the right move going forward. Instead of viewing such an expansion as requiring us to \u201cfork\u201d the protocol for a totally different stable, view it more as adding another module to our repertoire.

The obstacles to rolling out a fully-fledged EuroDAI do seem significant (I appreciate the concerns raised by Protocol Engineering as to smart contract bandwidth and peg risks, in particular). However, the potential benefits for Maker - particularly in the long term - seem attractive. While the stablecoin competition for USD is highly contested, the Euro stablecoin market seems wide open. It could be a growth vector for Maker in a \u2018blue ocean\u2019 market (to steal a terrible business school phrase). I also like the idea that EuroDAI, even in the form of a limited experiment, offers Maker some diversification away from the USD, boosting the medium and long-term resiliency of the protocol. I\u2019m sympathetic to the argument that the DAO should be focusing on our core protocol and offerings, but if we want to grow the protocol, this seems like one of the more logical vectors to examine. It would be useful to get a sense from CUs, if possible, as to what the resource estimates would be to add/monitor EuroDAI as another module in our repertoire (perhaps as a limited, single vault experiment - as a starting point).
