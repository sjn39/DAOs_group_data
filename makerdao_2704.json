                    "content": "Edit: Vote is now live Hello everyone. As most of you are aware, an emergency signal request was posted over the weekend and has resolved in favour of action. Given this outcome an executive vote will go on-chain on Monday. However, for a number of reasons that are detailed below, the parameters included in the on-chain executive will not directly match those presented in the emergency signal poll. Emergency Signal Results Winning Emergency Signal Option  32/55 Voters ~58% Majority  USDC-A LR: 101% USDC-A DC: 200 million PAX LR: 101% PAX DC: 100 million Losing Emergency Signal Option  25/55 Voters ~45% Minority  USDC-A LR: 105% USDC-A DC: 200 million PAX LR: 105% PAX DC: 100 million What will be included? Executive on Monday USDC-A LR: 110% -> 103% USDC-A DC: 100 million -> 200 million PAX LR: 120% -> 103% PAX DC: 5 million -> 30 million Box Parameter: 30 million -> 15 million On-chain Poll on Monday Subject: LR Ratio on USDC + PAX combined. Vote Type: Ranked (IRV) Options: 101%-105% Caveat: If the Monday executive passes, an outcome of 104% or 105% will not continue to executive. Why have we made changes?  Governance might not be properly informed about the scale the system might be affected at 101% LR for USDC-A and PAX. - @Primoz (more in a reply shortly) The previously planned USDC-A LR on-chain signal poll lets us drop to 101% on Friday 18th if MKR Holders vote in favour of it on-chain. This poll will be expanded to include PAX. It is difficult to go back up to 102% or 103% after dropping to 101%, so it makes sense to have this as an intermediate step. The emergency poll was heavily split between 105% and 101%, as was the preceding signal request. 103% represents a compromise between those two options. PAX was just introduced last week and we only started to test demand. As we showed in our collateral evaluation, PAX still has a very low presence in DeFi where most of DAI price arbitrage will probably be performed. This is why we are limiting proposed increase to only 30m, instead of 100m. - @Primoz  Box parameter change to 15m DAI was initially intended to go into Executive on Friday, but based on new information from keepers about the level of their capital reserves, we would want to perform that change as soon as possible. - @Primoz   ",

It is expected to have heavily increased stablecoin exposure at LR 101%, probably between 150-200m DAI debt minted on USDC and PAX from day one. Furthermore, arbitrage trades could be performed by single a Vault user by using iterative flash loans and collecting huge profits by only spending gas fees. We would then hope that this user repays its loan when DAI < 1.01 (net of fees). If not, Vaults would need to be manually liquidated, hopefully during liquidation 2.0, so Maker doesn\u2019t incur too much slippage and carries potential loss. Note that this is not the main reason for why it was decided to make an executive with 103% LR, but I just wanted to stress this, before a lower LR is proposed to an Executive vote (based on a Monday\u2019s poll). Also note that my personal preference is to decrease LR slowly and be more aggressive on collateral onboarding with assets such as cUSDC or yyCRV, where we basically achieve similar stablecoin exposure (more other protocol risk though) but Maker could charge much higher SF. We know that USDC-A won\u2019t be collecting much fees at low LR. ",

Increase in ETH price is the optimal solution for DAI stability and at that time the USDC stability fee could be raised really high which will push everyone to close their position.
